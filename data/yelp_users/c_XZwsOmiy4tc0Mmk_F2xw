It doesn't get better than this.  This is my absolute favorite pizza place in the Phoenix area. I hate waiting for a table, but it's always worth it.  If you are a regular, you might even get special treatment from the staff.  I highly recommend pepperoni with extra cheese. Yum!

I can't recommend this place enough. The entire staff is friendly, honest and trustworthy. They have told me when I didn't need work done (when I thought I did) and fixed flats for free.   The full service option is also great. I stopped in before a road trip and got a front end alignment, oil change and new wiper blades.   I have had all my tires replaced here and y husband also visited them when he had a flat (which they fixed for free).

I took my mom with me to Carrabba's to celebrate a new job because it is her favorite restaurant. We were not disappointed.  When I started to realize that we had been sitting for a few minutes without seeing a server, a manager walked over, apologized for the delay and took our appetizer and drink order.   We started with the delicious bread and then had crab cakes, that were oh-so-yummy. The drinks were delicious and the waiters were amusing. The atmosphere is casually Euro-hip and the open kitchen is always bustling with excitement.   When my Spiedino Di Mare (shrimp, scallops and asparagus) arrived, I was a bit put off by the look of the plate. For about $20, I received a bland plate with soggy yellowing spears of asparagus, 4 medium sized scallops and 4 pieces of stuffed shrimp. Nevertheless, it smelled GREAT.   I dove into the scallops immediately and they seemed to melt deliciously away on my tongue. The stuffed shrimp were had the same basic components - breaded and grilled with a generous lemon butter sauce to swim in.  The manager came over to check on us and I decided the asparagus wasn't too foul of a move since everything else was pleasant, so I didn't tell him. I'm surprised he didn't ask why I hadn't eaten any of the pitiful looking vegetable on the plate, however.  That being said, I love Carrabba's and will definitely be back!

It's amazing how one bad experience can sour the memories of all previous encounters...  We adopted our super-sweet 40 lb dog from Halo within this store a couple of years ago. She went through the poppy training program and has been getting her nails trimmed regularly here. We also regularly purchase fish and pet food from this store without incident.  Last week my husband brought in the dog to get her nails filed down. After waiting around for the staff to get organized and after two other people who came in after him were helped first, he was finally addressed. When he went to sign the paper, the girl quickly reached towards our dog and it startled her causing her to nip at the worker. She didn't gently introduce herself at all and understandably, the dog got scared. Our dog is around our 9 month old and other Children all the time and has never nipped or bit at anyone so this was very out of character. After this incident, my husband was told to leave and that they wouldn't trim the nails. He offered to muzzle her and they said no. After all of this time, money and service, they are now refusing to trim the puppy's nails when it could have been avoided if the girl had just gently and calmly introduced herself before taking the dog.  Disappointing.

I am so disappointed to the recent changes made at Rock Bottom! As a Weight Watchers member, having healthoer options when out to eat is vital. I used to love coming to RB for the turkey burgers.  Now the turkey burrs are gone to make way to push for the veggie burgers - not as good. I asked for a different bread option for their Turkey Reuben but none was available. I asked for a salad with low fat dressing, but again, none was available.  I almoat walked out because I couldn't find anything that I could ven make a special cooking reqieat on.  I won't be back.

My parents and friends met my husband and I for my birthday dinner here tonight and I was pretty disappointed overall.   Even though we had reservations, we still had to wait about 10 min to be seated. Not a big deal since there are so many fun things to look at on the wall, though.  We started with some garlic cheese bread that was skimpy on the cheese but pretty good when dipped in the fresh marinara. The small salad was good and enough for feed all 6 of us easily.  My parents ordered a pepperoni pizza, we ordered the steak Milanese and my friends ordered a Quattro formagio pasta dish. We were told several times that are food was only a couple of minutes away until we were finally told that the chef had burned the steak. The pizza came out right after and was very good, but the rest of us still didn't have our food.  The pasta dish came out next and my friend's husband asked what was in the dish because he was a vegetarian and wanted to make sure he knew which items were meat free. The waitress said only one of the items had meat in it but that didn't end up being the case. He even asked again after he tasted sausage in the shells and she said it was only cheese and spinach. After a few minutes she came back to tell us there was chicken sausage in the shells. Too late.  Eventually our steak Milanese came out and it looked delicious with the fresh tomatoes but didn't taste that way. I expected the breading to be crispy and instead it was very soggy. That taste drowned out everything else. I was very disappointed.  The waitress was nice and took the steak off the bill because of the delay but I was overall unimpressed and won't be back anytime soon.

I grew up a couple of blocks away from Pullano's, and I still live nearby.  My family is from Buffalo, so Pullano's pizza has been our go-to pizza place my entire life. They used to deliver, but it's still worth driving over for a pick-up.  The Giant slice lunch special is awesome. The wings are fantastic and the pizza is something I craved while I was living abroad.  The owner is usually in the building, and they even provide homemade sweets during the holidays.  There is free pizza in the bar after 10pm, and it's worth it, but it goes fast. It's a small bar and it usually contains a a few rowdy people. but since it's in walking distance of my house, it's a place I love visiting.  I've only ever had a couple of things besides pizza and they were all great - but the pizza and wings are what they are known for.  With football season upon us, make sure you wear your favorite team jersey when you visit, and enjoy!

The Memorial Day newspaper ad featured a new 2010 Lancer DE for $13,941 with 0% financing for 60 months PLUS $500 rebate. I drove the car and liked it. After dealer semantics, I was told that I couldn't get that price AND the 0% 60 month deal. I said I wanted that price and they came back and said $15 for that deal because it included a $995 Desert Protection Plan, whatever that is. I told them I didn't want the Desert Plan and they said they couldn't remove it, but they couldn't even tell me what it consisted of.  I said I wanted the car for the price in the ad (even if it meant 4.9% financing) and was told that EVEN IF WE HAD CASH, they could not sell me the car for the price in the ad. The slimy sales manager also said that's how all the dealers do it and you could not ever buy a car for a listed ad price. My family has done that before, so don't tell me we can't.  Needless to say, we walked out.

On May 29th, Chapman Mitsubishi had an ad in the Arizona Republic for a brand new Mistubishi Lancer for $13,941. When we tried to purchase the vehicle, they said they could not sell it for the advertised price, even if we were paying cash. They insisted that I paid almost $1000 for a "Desert Protection Package" that they could not remove from the car.  The salesman said this is how all advertising is done in the area and that you could not buy a vehicle for the price listed in an ad.

In all of the years I have lived in this neighborhood, this was my first visit to Lenny's. Overall, I was impressed with the food but underwhelmed by the strange layout.   My mom and I ordered single cheeseburger combos and very much enjoyed the fresh bun and veggies and flavorful burgers. Even the fries were great.  There is a separate and unattached dining room but at least it was nice and cool unlike the ordering area which is narrow and too warm.  I would definitely order from there again but maybe to go!

Our family's go-to Chinese take out in the NW Valley. It's fast, authentic, cheap and delicious.  The small Hot and Sour soup $3) was large and filling, but be careful you don't burn your mouth gulping it down.  The crispy fried duck was delicious when coupled with the spicy sauce. The Chicken and Veggies was a bit over-sauced even though I asked for light sauce.  I wish there was a no-sauce healthier option. Healthy Chinese food isn't easy to find...  Anyway, the food is always satisfying for the family and the wallet!

I used to work nearby and would visit JOTC weekly for lunch. It was never very busy and the lunch waiter would recognize us and get us everything we needed quickly.  The Keema Samosas are delicious!  If you are new to Indian food, I recommend the Non-Veg Thaali. It has an assortment of Tandoori chicken, curry, a veg dish, naan bread, yogurt and rice pudding - all for $10.  My favorite dish and the one I ordered every time was the Chicken Tikka Masala. It's like $15 and doesn't come with naan or rice, but it's worth it. It's a lot of food and it makes me oh-so-happy everytime.  By comparison, the lunch Chicken Curry special for $8 comes with rice AND naan.   The rice pudding is excellent as well.  I will miss JOTC!

I live around the corner from Bien Nails and I am so glad, because the staff is warm and friendly. The only complaint I have is of the constant attempt to "up-charge" ($5 for this or that).   Every service I have had has been done with care, professionalism and quality. I would recommend them to anyone but remember to turn down the extras you don't need or the bill will get up there!

Husband's choice: Brontasaurus Beef Ribs Platter - A full rack of beef ribs with bbq beans and steak fries. Delicious and enough two (or 3 with an extra side) to easily share.  My friend's choice: Bbq Brisket platter with mac and cheese and bbq beans. The brisket was velvety and tender and melted in your mouth.   My choice: BBQ Pulled Pork with a baked porato covered in bbq sauce and the veggie of the day (green beans). I also added a house salad.I chose to have all 3 bbq sauces on the side and loved them all. The bread would have been better if it was warmed and the green beans were a little too cooked for  me, but it was still overall a great dish.   The salad came out quickly and comes with croutons, egg and bacon. I wish there was a Fat Free salad dressing option, but at least they gad low cal Italian. The salad was huge and very good.  After a normal wait, our meals arrived and were promptly devoured (except for the monstrous ribs).  I could barely walk I was so stuffed!

Okay... First by letting me state that I have wanted to eat here for many years but I was under the impression that there was always a really long line so I put it off. I had high expectations. When I saw it on a list of the top 10 downtown Phoenix restaurants, I decided to try it for lunch. While the service was decent, I was overall disappointed with the food.  We got there a few minutes after opening so it wasn't busy. The fans were on and the A/C even kicked on at one point before several customers requested for them to be turned off (we had a high of like 65).  We started off with some free bread that was cold and served with a large dish of oil with nothing else in it. I wish the bread had been warmed.  We ordered a market salad which was $9 and consisted of pieces of watermelon and grapefruit, shaved fennel and way too much juice from the fruits and (I think?) topped with parsley. Not sure why but the tastes just did not work for me.   I ordered a green salad instead and got a very large pile of fresh greens tossed in a vinaigrette. While there were 3 olives, there was nothing else. I wish there had been a couple of other flavored incorporated.  We ordered two pizzas (Sonny Boy and Wiseguy) which people seemed to be ordering one per person. For $18 each, I expected them to be the best ever.  The white Wiseguy pizza had roasted onion and fennel sausage. It seemed rather bland to me.  The red Sonny Boy's best feature were the olives but I really felt the whole thing was disappointing. There was nothing special about any of the tastes to me and the prices seemed too high.  I definitely prefer Cibo, Grimaldis and Spinatos. I've been told that other locations tend to be "better" but that is obviously here say. I will probably never try it again.

I was tempted to visit Mike's by the "Best Lamb Shank in Town" sign outside their front door. Unfortunately, the first time my husband and I visited the restaurant, they were out of lamb! Still, we stayed and leaned on the advice of our overly helpful but well meaning waiter.  He recommended the Saganaki (Greek kefalograviera Cheese dipped in a very light batter baked in Butter and flamed with Ouzo) which was served with pita bread and was absolutely delicious and the perfect start to the meal.   We shared a delicious Greek Salad while waiting for our entrees and had time to take in the dining area. It was close to closing time, but the strip mall appearance from the outside simply didn't do the interior justice. The restaurant feels authentically to be a mix of Greek/Italian cuisine and culture. For the duration of the meal, I forgot that I was sitting in a strip mall in the NW valley.  For our entrees, my husband had the Baked Sea-Food Shells ($14.99 Fresh pasta shells filled with ricotta, feta, mizithra fontina topped with shrimps, bay scallops, fresh basil and baked with marinara and mozzarella) and was very impressed with the entire dish.  I chose Veal Marsalla ($14.99 made with portobello, shiitake, porcini and cremini mushrooms in a homemade roasted veal broth with sweet Marsalla wine) after a recommendation from the waiter. As a side note, I was happy and pleasantly surprised with the option of substituting the pasta for vegetables. The veal piece was very thin and a tad overcooked, but the marsalla sauce was complex and filled with the flavors of herbs and mushrooms.  We ended the meal with the Homemade Chocolate dipped Cannoli (Crisp shells filled with our sweet Ricotta cheese and topped with raspberry and chocolate syrup). They were a bit too frozen to eat right away, but one bit satisfied my sweet tooth for the night.  Overall, A- for effort and ambiance!  We have since been back again to Mike's to try the lamb shank, so stay tuned for that review.

How have I never been here before? Looks can be deceiving with this strip mall dive-looking place that has a cafeteria feel.  When one of the staff noticed me staring at the menu, he offered me samples of the most popular dishes and I was grateful. I ended up ordering the jade chicken quesadilla style and the emerald chicken. The food was fresh and fantastic! The emerald chicken sauce had a great flavor that made me want to keep eating it and the quesadilla with the tangy, sweet and spicy jade chicken was mouth watering. The free volcano brownie topped with powdered sugar was a perfect ending! Everyone should try Chino Bandido!

I love the live music and atmosphere on the patio.  The service was good and so was the food. We gad potato pancakes and a pretzel for appetizers. The pretzel was fantastic and the potato pancakes were ok, but not as good as my grandmother's.  I shared the combo for 2 with a friend. The sausage and ham were fab and the little salad was one of the best I have ever had. The ony thing we didn't like was the  meatloaf type thing on the combo platter.  The place cleared out pretty quicly Saturday night... By 9pm, people were packing up the patio.  Overall, it was a great time. I only wish there were some more veggie options for sides.

After living abroad for a few years, a favorite treat for my husband and I became Indian food. Once we moved back to Phoenix, I was determined to find a decent Indian restaurant.  After trying several disappointing restaurants throughout the city, I am pleased to say I found an excellent choice a few minutes from my house.  The restaurant is usually near empty when I've gone in for dinner. That worried me at first, but now I consider it an undiscovered gem.   I was glad to see that a buffet was not offered because in my opinion, quality matters more than quantity.  My husband and I order the same dishes every time we dine here. My husband is Iraqi and a lot of Indian cuisine mirrors some of his favorites. Although he has tried a couple of different items in the past, we always orders Lamb Biryani and Naan. There is definitely no shortage of food here. We are stuffed silly by the time we leave.  My favotie dish to Chicken Tikka Masala with a (massive) side of rice. It doesn't get any better in my opinion.  The decor is plain and the staff isn't overly friendly. The service isn't impeccable but the food compensates for it.

My husband and I lived in Korea for a combined 13 years. When we moved back to Phoenix, it didn't take us long to start craving our favorite foods.   We have tried every Korean place within 10m miles of our house (which, luckily for us, is really close to Chuhgajib) and this is by far our favorite.  Whether we have a craving for something specific or even something off the menu, we are never disappointed.  It's a bit pricier than food in Korea, but it's oh-so-yummy! The owners are wonderfully friendly, and the place reminds me of a place my husband and I called home for a long time. It makes me miss the all night sojo binges followed by a noraebang (karaoke).  My husband loves Haemul Tang (Seafood soup) and my fav is the bulgogi you grill at the table.   This place is authentic and if you've never had Korean food before, try the bulgogi, but make sure someone shows you how to eat it Korean-style.  If you love the kimchi like we do, they sell it to go!

This is not first time I have reviewed this place, so I won't cover the same things.  We keep coming back because the food is authentic, delicious and cheap. The lunch specials are great deals and a great way to try something new.  The only criticism I have is timing... It takes awhile to get drinks and the food comes out sporadically. It never comes out at the same time.

I'm so torn about writing this update. I've been to this place more times than I can count in the last few years and I would even say we were friendly with the owners. The food was always good. That being said, I doubt I will ever go back.  Our party of 3 (and a baby) were seated and ordered quickly. My two companions had the meat/sushi combo for $15. One got Bulgogi and Nigiri and my husband got the Salmon Teriyaki and Crispy Tuna Roll. I ordered the small Sashimi plate ($20). For the kiddo, we got the Bulgogi bowl ($6).   I will say that the side dishes were good and we do love the kimchi. The Bulgogi came out first for my friend. It didn't come with rice but he liked it. My husband's Salmon came out next and it was the smallest piece of fish I have ever seen... Maybe 2 oz worth. He had to order a side of rice with it for $1. The baby's Bulgogi and rice bowl had more food than my friend's dish, which was weird. We had about 3 servings of the side dishes. The kimchi was good but the potatoes were flaked with ice.  45 min into the meal, we still didn't have any sushi. I mentioned it to the waitress and she said the Sushi Chef was backed up. A few minutes later, the manager/owner came out - presumably to help. I watched him watch football for a good 10 min before helping the Sushi Chef, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt in case there was something out of his control.  A good 10 min later, my friend got his 6 pieces of Nigiri. The only saving grace was that he did like it. A few minutes later, my husband got his roll.  At this point, everyone had been given their food but me and let's face it - a Sashimi dish  doesn't need to be cooked so almost an hour to deliver seems ridiculous.  The fish was fresh but I was unhappy. I had a $20 LivingSocial deal that I had paid about $10 on so that was deducted from the bill. We asked for boxes and the bill about 3 times before we got it. I'm not sure why - there were a few tables but there appeared to be at least 2 waitresses and a hostess.  When I looked down at the bill, it was not ours. In retrospect, it was only $28 so I should have just paid it. I brought it up to the waitress and she gave me the correct bill - $48 - WITH the $20 discount from my $10 coupon. I mentioned that I was a long time customer and that I was disappointed that the manager didn't even offer an apology or a comp - even on something small like the kids' meal. She said the manager told her no  more discount because we had a coupon.  At that point, I told the manager that I was very disappointed and had a very bad experience that night. He IGNORED me. He didn't even apologize.  I sat and waited for another 10 min for the waitress to pick up my money and to provide change. She never came so I found some smaller bills and left her a tip. I don't blame her for everything, but I was still unhappy.  After so many good experiences here, I am torn about giving this review because of one really bad experience. It would have been so easy to make this right. A heartfelt apology and acknowledgement from the manager would have sufficed as would an apology and a small comp. We got nothing after years of supporting this business. I feel like my business obviously doesn't matter to this establishment and I can't go back after this for a long time - maybe ever.  I know restaurants and people have bad or off days. I get it. We're all human. But, come on, make an effort!

My husband and I ate a lot of sushi while we were dating and living in South Korea. Naturally, every time we find another sushi place with a Korean chef, we feel instantly at home. Kabuki is an excellent example of this.  Sit at the bar and strike up a chat with one of the sushi chefs. Let them recommend their favorite dishes to you.   Whether I visit this place for lunch or dinner, I always leave happy. The staff is friendly and the food is great.  Pick a designated driver and then ask for a bottle of soju - our favorite Korean alcohol. Try an appetizer (maybe whatever is on special); Edamame is great of you are new to this kind of food. Have some soju. Have a roll or two... I like the Rainbow Roll, myself. Have some more soju. Maybe end the meal with some sashimi; then more soju.  Tip them. You'll be happy.

I love this deli and lucky for me, it's right around the corner!  Everything I have ever ordered has been fresh and delicious and comes with a smile from the friendly staff. I highly recommend the Pastrami and no matter which bread you choose, it's all made in house and is incredible!

My new cold remedy - Chicken Pho.  I walked in on a Saturday at about 11:30am. The small dining area was packed with a diverse crowd.  I ordered Thai Iced Tea, Spring Rolls and Chicken Pho. The spring rolls were fresh and tasty, but I was not feeling well and looking forward to the Pho.  Within 10 minutes, a large steaming bowl of Chicken Pho was placed in front of me. While there were plenty of noodles, there wasn't much meat. Still, it was delicious and it hit the spot. After a few dashes of Chili Sauce, I was also feeling much better.  The food was good and cheap, the staff was friendly and I have since visited again with my husband.

I love this place for breakfast! Even on a busy weekend morning, the place works like  well-oiled machine. Everyone seems to know how to move efficiently and effectively in seating and serving people as quickly as possible.  The food is always delicious and the portions are large, so don't be afraid to share if you aren't that hungry.

Another Sushi bar run by friendly Koreans. This one though, is a step above the others.  The chef (and owner I think) Paul, was incredibly friendly and explained how he uses only quality ingredients - especially in the reasonably priced and delicious small sashimi platter ($27). You can tell that quality is important to Chef Paul.  The Happy Hour specials (every day 3-5pm) keep bringing us back for the $5 rolls - Salmon and Shrimp rolls and $3 large Sapporo are our favorites.  We also tried the baked scallop cheese appetizer ($8)and it was simply sinful.

I go to Thai Basil almost every week and the Panang or Massaman Chicken curries with brown rice are my faves. I like somewhere on the spice level between Medium and Hot, but I cannot do spicier than Medium here. If you are feeling crazy, try Thai Hot on the spice meter. Drink a LOT of water.  This restaurant turns out great food super quickly and you get a satisfying meal for $10.   There are 2 reasons why I can't give Thai Basil 5 stars...  1. You don't get the yummy free salad if you get an order to go And 2. They told me it would cost $1 for a to-go cup of my drink (The Good Egg next door gives you free to go cups filled fresh).  Still, great Thai food and a great group of waiters.  I'll be back.

My mom and I wanted to try a new place for dinner. We'd seen this place before and deciphered that it was an Irish place from the Guiness signs in the window.  Right away, you get the feeling that it is a genuine Irish pub. Not that I've ever been to a pub in Ireland, but I didn't feel like I was in Peoria, that's for sure. There are 2 bars and a couple of dining sections.   We sat in a strange size booth next to the bar, but we asked for a booth and it was the only one left.  Happy hour consisted of $1 off well drinks and appetizers. There was a decent selection of scotch and Irish Whiskey. We got the house scotch and paid $5 for it. The menu also said they sell cigars.   It made me think of the Ireland episode that Anthony Bourdain did. I could easily picture him in the place.   The menu was huge so we asked the waitress for suggestions, and she gave us a few of her favorites as well as a few of her least favorites.  I ordered the Gaelic Chicken which consisted of a giant heap of mashed potatoes covered with chicken breasts, veggies and a yummy mushroom sauce. It wasn't AMAZING, but it was good.  My mom had the Reuben with fried mushrooms. The corned beef was excellent (and HUGE) as were the mushrooms.  The bartender looked of Irish decent and the Guinness on tap looked delicious.  We will definitely be back!

You can always count on an excellent trip when you visit Grimaldi's. I have never had a bad experience in any way in any of the times I've eaten at this location or any other one for that matter. Grimaldi's gives a consistently professional experience and always has scrumptious food.  Today was no different. My husband and I we were in for lunch so we started with a small Mediterranean salad to share (that we could have split to with more people as well) and a half carafe of the house wine.   We ordered a pesto pizza with beef meatballs, jalapenos and mushrooms. The thin crust is delicious the pesto is to die for. It is one of my favorite pizzas in the valley.   We ended the meal with a slice of Bailey's Irish Cream cheesecake and a glass of Moscato. The service was spot on and the entire experience was enjoyable. I highlt recommend Grimaldi's to everyone!

This place is completely ineffective and inefficient. The coffee pots were overflowing, there was no ice in the machine and no one seemed to have a clue what was going on.  I ordered 2 Sausage Biscuits with cheese (no egg). The guy taking my order was insistent that it would be $.40 extra for cheese for each one. I understood. I ordered a coffee as well. I didn't get a receipt. Then I didn't get any cream or sugar with the order. Only one of the sandwiches has cheese on it. The ice machine had no ice but no one out of the 6-8 people standing around did anything about it. The hash browns were cold.   The sandwiches were good but that's the only saving grace here. Get your act together people!

The pizza was crisp and delicious. The place is super casual and very comfortable. The staff is down-to-earth and friendly.  I loved the live music from Tom Mein on the patio. It felt great to be able to sit on the patio and enjoy a downtown Phoenix sunset in the spring.  Having beer and wine for sale was nice as well. I will be back to try more of the menu.

The ambience gives it the 5th star. The wine selection is great though the waitress admitted not knowing anything about wine.  The mussels are a great way to start and the Thai ice cream is a great way to end.   They moved the guitar player to the bar but I wish they hadn't. She adds to the upscale Thai feel.   The curry is super spicy so beware. I usually order medium but it was too much for me to handle. The portions are huge and all entrees have been delicious. Ask the server for suggestions.

For my first visit, my friend (who has to eat Gluten Free) and I sat on the patio. The weather was great but I wish I had been face to face with something other than a row of cars. There aren't enough garden restaurants in Phoenix, IMHO. We were seated immediately and after a few moments I had a waited at my table. It was Happy Hour - 1/2 price drinks and Munchies - so I asked for what they had in wine and it was limited to the house brand of each variety for $5/ glass normally but $2.50 for HH. I ordered the Pinot Noir and the stuffed portobello mushroom after the waiter suggested that it could be gluten free with the balsamic dressing on the side. The mushroom was decent sized and delicious. Per the menu, a Portobello mushroom cap stuffed with artichoke hearts, feta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and mozzarella. Baked and drizzled with a balsamic glaze. Served on a bed of spring mix tossed with an herb vinaigrette dressing. It was moist, savory and flavorful and at $9+ normally, HH was a steal at less than $5.  I also ordered twice backed chicken wings mild. They came out after the mushroom and although I really liked the taste, I thought they were small. Maybe this is because breaded and deep fried wings are likely bulkier and make them seem bigger (shrug). Either way, we enjoyed them.   For the main entree, she ordered a gluten free pizza and enjoyed it. She said that the recent change in the gluten free crust was a good one and that it had improved from her previous visit.  I had a small Thai Dye (Olive oil and garlic base, all natural grilled curry chicken, mozzarella cheese, Roma tomatoes, onions. Topped with fresh basil, cucumbers and a sweet swirl of Thai chili sauce.) at the recommendation of the waiter and really appreciated the unique toppings. The cucumbers were the perfect refreshing topping to the spicy sweet sauce. I ended up taking half the pizza home for lunch the next day and enjoyed it cold too!  Overall, I was impressed and will be back to try the Holy Shittake Pizza next.

I'm torn in writing this review because I've been here several times and always had an awesome experience, but today the service was horrible - and there were only 2 other tables.  The Roquefort appetizer is a must. We alway start with it whether we come in for brunc on the weekend or dinner with friends.   The swiss cheese fondue is always a treat. Last time I was here we had that and finished with the caramel dessert fondue. In between we had the Hanging Man - served tableside by the chef and a serving of chicken with all the great sauces.  This trip, however, we had the Bretonne and Mediteranee crepes.  The service today was horrible and if I had never been there before, it would male me not want to come back.  Come for dinner during the week when properly staffed an enjoy a bottle of wine!

I had a Groupon and was first told that it wasn't good for happy hour peices. Service was good, but the food was meteocre. The chili and corn cakes disappointed me becuase over the overall blandness.   The side salad was miniscule but tasty. The onion rings were really good, but not enough to make me go back.

This was not our first visit and will not be the last. We had Sunday Brunch here today and everything was perfect!  We sat in the covered patio area in front of the outdoor fireplace. We ordered $3 Mimosas and some excellent brewed coffee.   My husband had the Salmon Benedict and I had the Waffle Plate. We both got scalloped potatoes as the side and they were delicious, although I added a little more salt to mine. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and although my hello cheddar cheese topper wasn't melted, it was still delicious. The waffle was fluffy and moist. The bacon was cooked perfectly and everything was a great portion size.  We had so many people checking on us throughout our dining experience that I almost lost track of our server. At one point, the owner even came over to check on us and even surprised us with comping a drink.   As far as Sunday Brunch places, this is one of my favorites in the Peoria area. Occasionally, we even bring our dog with us and sit on the patio where she even gets her own water dish. This area definitely lacks dog friendly restaurant patios!  It's also one of my favorite weekend places to sit at the bar, sip a nice glass of wine, snack on some brilliantly stuffed mushrooms (though a little high on the price scale) and enjoy live music.  I can't wait until it cools down a bit more and the patio is even more inviting!

My husband and I used a Living Social deal for $29 each for an hr massage. The outside looked like a typical strip mall store, but once inside I was pleasantly surprised when we were greeted by name and given some fruit infused water.   After filling out a short form, we toured the facility and saw all of the services (but the place was empty!)  I wish that we were asked if we would prefer male or female therapists, because I dId request a slight change, but they were both fine with it.  My massage focused on my lower back since I have pain from a degenerative disc. My therapist spent the entire Hour making me feel great. He knew exactly what I needed and gave the perfect amount of pressure.   I would definitely go back with a other similar deal.

The sofa section with the hookahs and the dance floor looked like something I wanted to partake in but the service was less than wonderful and the food was undercooked - I've had better.  Unfortunately, most Middle Eastern restaurants that I have been to lack In the service department. We were the 2nd table in the Egyptian themed restaurant. About 10 min after us, a large group came in and the one server/bartender didn't seem to be able to cut it. We had an appetizer before we had even ordered our main meal. We were done with the appetizer before we even got a chance to get drinks or order our main meals. This meant that we were sitting with menus in our hands while eating the appetizer. It wouldn't have been a big deal but I really wanted to have a drink other than water as well.   The appetizer we got was the Cleopatra platter for $15 and it had a lot of food with it! I think the best item on the platter was the Tabouleh but adding the meat to the hummus was also pretty tasty. For me, that's where the praise ends.  The service was poor due to being understaffed so I had to flag down someone when my Salmon Kabob came out RAW. The Shrimp Kabob was good but it was not an easy process to actually get to the meat. Even after the Salmon was replaced, no one bothered to even offer to discount any part of the meal. Overall, I am disappointed and will probably not go back.  Meh. I've experienced better.

Meh. I like the revolving conveyor belt, but I wonder how long the sushi sits out for and how long it's good like that. Instead of offering to heat it up, why don't you just remove the no longer hot items from the belt before customers take them?  The sushi on the conveyor belt was average. The service at the table was decent but the order for hand rolls took too long.  We came because of the Groupon, but there are plenty of other sushi places I prefer.

I purchased the 2 Groupon deal and will be back.   It seemed a little strange that after I told the guy what I wanted, we went a cleared a table instead of taking my order... Maybe it's a cultural difference. Good thing the food made up for the awkwardness!  Today I had the Greek Goddess Salad (gyro meat, feta, cherry tomatoes and olives) and a side of Garlic Fries. Had I not read the Yelp reviews, I wouldn't have known to order the fries since the sides were not displayed anywhere within the store- but man I am glad I did. They smelled terrific and were worth the calories! The salad was at the recommendation of the cashier and it didn't disappoint. The meat was tender and seasoned perfectly. The veggies were fresh and crisp. Overall, the salad was very filling by itself.   The salad, fries and a drink cost me exactly the value of the Groupon - $12. I feel obligated to point out that I didn't see anything in the store about a combo either... So maybe he just pulled this price out of nowhere when he saw my Groupon.  In conclusion - the food was delicious and I would have given 5 stars if the combo option and side prices were clearly displayed.

Always fast, delicious and friendly! It looks like a fun place to be and the workers look happy to be there.  The coffee always comes out exactly as ordered and the runners make the long lines bearable.

Great Happy Hour deals. We loved the $4 chicken quesadilla and my husband enjoyed the $3 Firestone beer.   I ordered a side salad and the $5 salad came out as an entree size side. I suggest a smaller portion for a side salad. The waitress told us the other option was a ramekin sized salad that would have been too small. Feels a little like Goldilox.  The prices seemed a bit on the high side for the area with a ribeye at $19 and country fried steak at $17... Until we saw the portion sizes. Both dishes could have easily been split between two adults. The country fried steak came with a spicy chorizo sauce that was my favorite part of the whole dish, mashed potatoes and veggies. Overall, a decent meal.  My husband's ribeye came with very tasty black beans and a large baked potato. I found the ribeye to be a bit bland but my husband really enjoyed it.  We'll be back but maybe we will split a meal and add a couple of appetizers.

My husband loves this place. Since he is from the Middle East, we have been to every Middle Eastern restaurant around and this is by fav his favorite. It's normal for him to eat there once or more a week.  He says the lamb and beef shawarma is the most authentic he's had here. He also likes the shish kabobs, falafel and salads. The prices are great, too, costing him only about $7.  The service is good and the food is fresh and affordable and reminds him of home. That's good enough for me.

After deciding to purchase spa packages for Mother's Day I did a lot of research before ending up buying a great deal at Spa 810. After a couple of phone tag messages, I was finally able to book facials and massages for my mother and myself for that weekend.   We arrived to a sleek and stylish though small lobby and found registration forms waiting for us with our names on them. Right on time, I was brought back to first have a facial with Laurel. I did appreciate the free brow shaping before the facial. The products and steps were well explained and Laurel listened when I said I had sensitive skin. The "pod" was a new but comforting feeling and I appreciated being able to request temperature adjustments. The time for the facial went fast and it was refreshing.  A few minutes later, I met Brent for my massage. He was warm and friendly and really listened to the areas I wanted to focus on. I really enjoy firm pressure and he did not disappoint. He was very professional and knowledgable and even knew how to handle my very ticklish feet! I really think he has a magical touch by the end of the session, I felt like putty. I only wish it didn't end!   The room had a nice ambiance and relaxing music playing. The entire experience was fantastic and I think I will end up purchasing a membership.

The food is always delicious, the people are helpful and patient and the experience is always a good one! It can be a bit pricey but it's worth it! The moist brisket is my favorite!  I just wish there were some tables that were easier to get into than the picnic table style. :)

This is our favorite local hangout... Especially since it's in the same parking lot as our martial arts school. The servers are wonderful and the food is always good. There's always a great selection of beer (duh - it is a brewery) and it's a welcoming atmosphere. We love the free wifi and dig the music. Keep it up!
