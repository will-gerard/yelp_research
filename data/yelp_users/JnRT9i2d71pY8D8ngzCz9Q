With ever increasing choices to dine downtown, the downtown deli used to be a great choice but not so much anymore.  While they do have plenty of reasonably priced items the main attracting is their Pastrami Sandwiches.    Recently I ordered a New Yorker Sandwich which comes with fries starting at a little less then 10 bucks.  The sandwich was good but their extra charges add up.  They charged me extra for cheese and some other charge which I was not sure of.  My drink was also an additional 1.99.  For a lunch total of 14.00 dollars for a sandwich fries and a drink.  Pretty pricey.  If I was getting mounds of pastramis like they used to put on the sandwich I would have felt like I got the value.  But the portion size are just average.    So I would say stay away if your on a budget or want more for your money.

As good as it gets.  Thats a pretty good way of putting it! If your into Salvadoran Food or if you are not this is your place.  Located near 14th street and McDowell the building is near a chinese place in an old white building.  You have to park in the back and at first glance you may question yourself for choosing this place.  But it really is worth it.  Once you get inside the place is spotless.  Very well kept.  The menu's do explain what you are eating so no surprises.    I got the Carne Asada plate.  The steak  was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  It came with yellow rice, beans, a salad, and tortillas.  The tortillas were thick and grilled.  I also shared a bean and cheese papusa.  The papusa was awesome basicly a tortilla stuffed with beans and cheese.  You have to try it.  Our meal came with chips and salsa and a salvadorian slaw mixture to share.    The price was right and the staff is friendly food A++++++++  Good for lunch if you work in the downtown area not too packed.

Best Mexican food in the valley for the money!  Location is in a not so good part of town but a lot of local police and fireman eat there during lunch time during the week.  The tortillas are made fresh and you end up wanted to take some home with you.  The red chili burro is very good and the rice and beans is so fresh it makes your mouth water thinking about it!  There is a line during the week so be prepared but the food is ready in no time.  Staff is very nice and friendly, food is hot and fresh, not too bad!

What a fun place in Scottsdale. Dinner and a movie you cant beat that. Plus drinks. On the plus side the food was very good. If you stay with sandwiches you can get away with a dinner for 10 bucks and under for one person plus drink. They have about 8 sandwiches. And don't get me wrong this isn't your moms turkey and wheat toast . Mine was a Fillet Mi non with Blue Cheese crumble sandwich on a roll. It was oh so tasty and the meat was tender and juicy.   The service is excellent they leave a little flashing square thingy for the waiter if you need anything during the show. The drinks are about average for Scottsdale I got a 20 oz blue moon for 5.50 and my woman got a glass of wine for about 8 bucks. Both our dinners came with a choice of Salad or Fries. We had salads. They were very good too and fresh!   The average price for an entree here that isn't a salad and sandwich is about 18-35 bucks. Desserts range from 4-9 bucks and appetizers 5-15 depending on the specials and such. You can get fresh popcorn as an appetizer and they bring it out fancy style in a black dish.   Overall I say this is a very fun place to take a date or try once in a while. Its pretty expensive if you go all out but you can also do well if you pick the lesser items. Total for dinner and movie for us was 77 bucks plus tip. That included an appetizer (burchetta) 2 beers 2 glasses of wine 2 dinner sandwiches with salad and 2 movie tickets Enjoy!

What a treat.  We sure were surprised at the quality of the sushi here.  This is a small joint so come early or be prepared to wait.  The place right off of bell road which was nice and the parking was good.    We went to Tokyo Lobby at around 8pm and lucky for us there was a table open right when we got there.  The hostess sat as after the bus boy/server/bus boy cleaned the table.  It took about ten minutes before we could place our order and it seemed that way because one waitress was taking orders in the entire place.  We also had to ask for her to take our order also.  She seemed a little over whelmed with the amount of tables she had so we said here we go have a little patience.  We ordered all of our food at once knowing that if we ordered drinks and waited to order when the drinks came it would take forever.    Our Sushi was excellent! Very Very Very good and fresh.  The Edamame was so fresh and good and huge portion.  Our beers cold you cant go wrong with kirin!  But my favorite had to be the phoenix roll it was so amazing.  The spicy tuna role was very much the same as most places except they put this awesome sauce on it and it is actually spicy! go figure spicy to a phoenix resident!  Overall I say go and go again! They have bento bowls for those who want a combo but the Sushi A+++++  I would give 5 stars if the service was a little bit better  2 large kirin beers,Edamame,2 miso soups,2 rolls of sushi phoenix and tuna, and 2 sashimi plates with yellowfin tuna and octopus = 61 bucks.  Not too bad!

Since the last review of the place took place in March of 2009 it seems they have improved a bunch.  Not sure if its new management or maybe its a change of style but I have eaten here many times and the food has been great.  We have had some of the friendliest servers in the valley here. The last time we went to Bill Johnsons our waitress went out of her way to make sure we had everything hot fresh and timely.    Whats cool is every night they have a dinner special.  They have one called the BBQ blowout it has Beef Ribs, Pork Ribs, Chicken, a sausage, rolls a salad and beans all for 9.99.  That's a great deal.  They also have really nice prime rib and beef rib specials.    The BBQ is pretty good.  Its pretty similar to what you would find at a chain BBQ place.  I recommend getting BBQ only on the special because then its more worth the money.  They have really good steaks and burgers, and the chicken is outstanding.  Stick with chicken and you wont be disappointed.    A little warning they do have sawdust on the floor as it is part of their theme.    Overall I like this Bill Johnsons its not a bad meal and for the money you cant lose.

Located in the heart of downtown right off of Washington Sticklers serves as a hub for the business and working class alike.  They have bar seating wear you can people watch out the windows or sit down tables inside and out.    How sticklers works.  First you go order a sandwich to the right as you walk in.  Then you grab a side, then your sandwich comes out of a toaster oven while the sandwich maker ask you what you want on it.  The sign above list in order of toppings.   The first time you go it can be quite awkward but the more times you go you realize how efficient this is.  It keeps the crowd moving.  If you want to hit this place for lunch I suggest going between 11 and 1130.  Forget it at noon its mostly working downtown folks and the line and seating can get way out of control.    The food is pretty good. I enjoy the Roast Beef Sandwich with provolone the best.  With a side of Jalapeno chips.  Makes for a good meal.  They also have a pretty nice salad set up where you can pick through the glass what you want on the salad.  One thing most people don't really know about is sticklers has the best milk shakes in the downtown area.  Period.  These are hand spun real ice cream little wonders of joy.  The Chocolate Malt will melt your heart its so good.  You can also just get regular ice cream if you want also.    Overall this is a nice sandwich shop with added bonuses.  It has become a regular place for me to go to as I work downtown.

This place has pretty awesome food!  I had the cocino soup and it was both tasty and authentic.  The soup had big chunks of potato and beef.   The chips and salsa took a little bit of getting used too (tomato paste like). But then the salsa became adicting.    It was band night so it got pretty loud.  They play country music on one side and have a dj on the other.  The part of town is sketchy like someone said but keep in mind the police station is right down the street.  Give this place a shot it's pretty tasty!

Craving a burger from the grill?  Go to hamburger works.  Unlike a lot of hamburger places in town this place cooks your burger on a real BBQ like the one in your backyard.  Well sort of :) their BBQ is a lot bigger!    Ordering is kind of weird you order at the station next to the grill then walk around the corner to pay and then they call out your number.  I think they do this so that you can walk around and see the burgers grilling and the kitchen.    On the other side of the place there is a full bar.  They also have an outside eating area and back entrance.    The food is awesome.  I have been here pretty regular since I discovered it on yelp.  The buns have always been fresh and the burgers are grilled so they are not as juicy and greasy.  But thats a good thing.  They have an awesome flavor! The condiment bar is pretty cool.  You get the standard fair.  This is pretty much a build your own burger place.  I like to take my burger and put lettuce tomato onions and thousand island.  Its like an in and out on steroids!   The fried fair is good. Im not a fan of their french fries I usually go for the half mushroom/zucchini combo.  But if you get a combo with fries I recommend getting a ranch cup from the condiment bar and dipping them in that.  Their ranch is so good!     The Chicken sandwich is also good.  Get the plain unless you want to be covered in sauce.   Overall I love this place this is a great family restaurant and you wont break the bank.  Only thing I would knock a star off is for customer service.  About half the time the person behind the counter seems to have an attitude for some reason.    Will be back for another burger.

Pino's Pizza you are my new friend downtown.  This place is a traditional mom and pop Italian Pizza Place.  The Pizza is New York Style and is greasy bready flavor explosion delicious.  What surprising to me was how many other items they have on the menu such as pastas, and salads.  They also have dessert and a small but good wine and beer selection.  The prices are just right.  The large pizza is huge! They make it fresh with fresh ingredients.  The service was outstanding and friendly.  One thing I noticed was the owner was there and he knew the names of all his customers.  They have a lot of repeat customers which is makes you feel at home in this place.  I love it and you will too.

What can I say about Mi Cocina Mi Pais.  Lets just say looks can be deceiving.  For one thing they built a taco bell right in front of this place.  I find myself sitting in the restaurant looking at taco bell and wondering why someone would eat there when they could get a nice home cooked meal 20 feet away!  Looking at the first photo on yelp of the location you can tell that this is a typical mom and pop strip mall restaurant.  Literally though it is a mom and pop place.  The son was the waiter the mom was the cook and the dad helps out when he can come in from his other job.  The service is kind of slow because of this but look past it your about to get a fresh home cooked meal! The inside has wooden tables and chairs and kind of reminds me of a deli.    The food.  Well to start out we got two drinks I got one which can only be compared to horchata and she got the Inca soda which tasted like bubble gum so cool!  They bring you the best tasting salsa and chips I have ever had a at a South American Restaurant.  Our appetizer was a South American Potato Salad.  The presentations was awesome on the salad it had three olives some egg and a sauce that had me scraping it off of the dish after we had ate all the potatoes.  It was slightly spicy but very light surprisingly and very comforting.     For dinner we had the combo plate.  It had rice, eggs, beans,steak, avocado ,sausage, pork rind, fried plantains, potato cake,flour cake, and a tomato pepper mixture sauce.  OMG the combination was perfect for two of us to share.  The beans reminded me of back home when my buddy's dad used to make them on their farm.  I could be in heaven eating just the beans and rice.  The steak was very tender and flavorful.  My palate was left very satisfied.    For Authentic South American Food go here.  If you want to try something new go here. If you want good ol comfort food go here.

I went to this place as a last minute decision based on the fact there was no wait.  Not by word of mouth and certainly not by any reviews I have read.  It was simply chance that brought me here.    Upon arrival  I had my wife get us a table so I could go park the car, the server asked her when I would be there and my wife said he is parking the car.  The hostess said I guess I can seat you then.  So after she gets seated the server comes up and ask where I am at.  This was pretty rude.  My wife orders drinks while I am parking the car.  I show up and look over the menu.  They offer a small but to the point menu.  They have mesquite broiled chicken, salads, ribs and other items.  I ordered the Ribs and Chicken plate (26 bucks).  My wife ordered the Macho Salad (17 BUCKS).  The price is not the issue but the food sure was.  My two ribs were burnt to a crisp I mean charcoal and my chicken was cold as ice.  So either our food had been ready and sitting for a while or the server decided to mess with me.  My wife's salad was amazing.  It had goat cheese, chicken and all the fixings.  The drinks were good too.    Overall this place feels like the typical Scottsdale run of the mil attitude infested restaurant that seems to fit the reputation of the area however there are tons of better and friendly restaurants in the area.  My recommendation is to skip this place unless its a last resort.

We went here last night it was so much fun.  The owners are a polish couple who keep the place very immaculate!  The atmosphere is fun .  I counted there are only about 7 tables in the entire restaurant but there is seating outside.    The meal starts out with some pumpernickel bread and butter which was very tasty.  We ordered the beet salad it was fresh and not over bearing when it comes to pickling.  For my dinner I ordered the house special which is sort of like a pot sticker with meat.  But they put a polish spin on it which had a butter sauce and bacon bits followed by sour cream.  She had the cabbage rolls which were very large.  The plate comes with three.    We shared our meals so we could get a taste of everything.  For dessert we had a tipple layer chocolate tart which had a chocolate cherry filling.  It was so gooooooooood!     The menu mostly consist of polish food.  Its a very neat place if you want authentic polish.  This was the first true polish meal I ever had and it was fantastic.  Prices were great for a Friday night.  Two drinks two meals a salad ,  bread and butter , and dessert came out to 30 bucks!    Cant beat that.  Plus the food was homemade.  The place itself is nestled in downtown Glendale its a little hard to find the first time but trust me its well worth it.  It almost feels like eating in someones house.  Very fun very different.  Try something new and go here.  And you also feel good because you just supported a local mom and pop business!

I am giving this place a 5 star for food and a 3 star for location.  Located in the heart of downtown/old town Avondale.  This little place which is actually much bigger on the inside is a little bit of heaven.  Talk about Mexican comfort food. They have all the usual fair plus a few good soups.    You start with the Chips and Salsa.  The Salsa was homemade and oh so delicious.  I had the BBQ Plate which was an explosion of flavor.  I can't even tell how good this was. It came with seasoned beef, rice,beans, guacamole, and tortillas. My mouth waters thinking about when I will be able to get this dish again.  My wife had the Machaca Burro which was also very delicious.  Soda's are served in huge cups.    This place is good.  It looks a little bit run down on the outside but on the inside its nice and clean.  Even though this is defiantly a spot where local regulars come do not be intimidated to walk in as they are very welcoming and after one visit you will want to be a regular.  If your looking for GOOD homemade Mexican food try Cafe Zamora.  Come here for lunch and give it a chance. The price is just right too.

Hidden gem of Chinese food in the valley.  This place is very good.  It has all the favorite Chinese dishes plus many not common dishes.  Such as their specialty of BOBO chicken which is basically a fried chicken in garlic sauce.  The prices are the best on average a combo meal for dinner is about 6.25 and that is as of today.  It is a family ran business and they all work there.  The food is served fresh to order every time.  The egg drop soup is the best by far when compared to other Chinese places.  If you want to go out of the box and try something good at a very good price and have great service go here.    My favorites from this restaurant are  Bobo Chicken Mandarin Chicken (awesome) General TSO chicken Yakisoba  Egg Rolls Chicken Wings  The address can be kind of confusing but it is really easy to get here its right off of grand avenue  and 87th ave right next to a big lots.

Situated right off of thunderbird and the 101 towards sun city this place is pretty convenient to get too from off the freeway.  The food here is terrific.  they are known for their BBQ but I tend to order other items as they are just as good.    The smoked turkey is fantastic juicy and lean.  They also have deep fried pickles which are sooo soo good.  Addicting.  Their homemade ranch dressing is the bomb.  One other thing this place is known for is the Onion Rings! Get a half order they are humongous!  The prime rib is one of my favorites it has a slightly bacony taste to it.  Overall give dillions a shot.  Its good to take the wife and grandma too!   I  Love this place never had a bad meal.  The Dillons dip is the best french dip sandwich around.  I also love the Beef Ribs and the Chilli is OMG Awesome they put brisket in it! Good for kids too!

My food came to the table 5 minutes after I ordered it as if the magic food fairy knew what I was going to order and started cooking it before I arived!  Wow I mean at least they could of microwaved my food.  The food was not cooked to order it was over priced and mediocre at best as far as Italian goes.  I'm still in shock over getting what clearly was pre made sauces and pre made chicken for 12 bucks a plate.  The service was lousy also the waitress who sat us waited 15 minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink she should have did thy when she sat us down.  This place just makes me sad

Fries were soggy and over salted.  Mayo condiment very salty.  Burger was ok kind of cold.  Bacon cheese mix nothing special says applewood bacon but the waiter explained to me it was like bacon bits.  Bacon bits really?  The hype is why people come but honestly there are way better burger places out there.  It's a trendy place with fancy lighting and a nightclub type atmosphere. I came at lunch and there is no lunch price its still $9.50 cents for burger with no fries.  Grain feed, organic I get it.  Thats why it is pricey.  But it should knock my socks off and this place does not. Comes with carrots and beet strings hmmm.  Good for groups but it is family style seating in the middle of the burger joint.  I did notice they have a large selection of not your typical beers so I may come back one day for a brew.

Not sure if Carly's has lowered their price or not but the food was very reasonable.  Sandwiches around 8 bucks and hummus and pita dip was 5.  Plus they have a 2 dollar beer special so cool!  I really like this place.  The server at our table was a little bit snobbish but other then that this is a great late night place to eat!   The food is a little bit trendy and posh but the prices not so much.   I don't  we went at 11pm on a Friday night and the food was served hot and fresh not like warm lamp fresh.  They give you way too much pita for your hummus but its so tasty you can eat it plain.    They warm it up which is a plus since a lot of places now a days think that cold stale pita is the way to go.  I had a pear sandwich grilled panini style which had Bree pear and prosciutto.    The Prosciutto was very thin just how it should be and Bree tasted very fresh.  I will be going back here for late night munching !  One last note they also have live music on the weekends ! Great fun!

Vietnamese food in Glendale?  Holy Crap this place was fantastic.  Its set in this little ol house on Glendale and 57th ave in what appears to be a local hangout  Whats cool is that this place must have a huge following because the waiter new half the people in the restaurant.   The place is small on the inside it has two rooms.  We were in the first one as you walked in which had seating for about 20+ people it was pleasantly decorated and the beer and wine was clearly visible from our table.  They serve house wine and beer.  And yes you can get Vietnamese beer here.    We started our meal with the appetizer crepes.  The crepes were filled with yummy shrimp pork and rice noodles.  Our waiter showed us how to eat these as they come with lettuce leaves that you are supposed to wrap the crepe in add some veggies and dip in oil.  Messy But FUN!  and so so tasty.  The crepe was light and so were the fillings.  Don't be intimidated by the size of the appetizer which is monstrous because if you share its enough.    For my dinner I had the dumpling soup.  Which was just awesome.  The broth is fantastic.  The egg noodles perfect and the garnish was absolutely awesome.  It comes with mint leaves, bean sprouts and lemon.  My girl had the mix rice bowl with chicken,pork, and egg rolls.  Hers was so mouth watering and she had so much we took the other half home and had a midnight snack!  Now I haven't had Vietnamese food in forever and I was over joyed by the friendliness and comfort of this place.  We will be back.  I would recommend this for anyone wanted to try something that is a little different but very tasty.  You will be glad you did!  Lastly I dont know what this is a two cash sign price range.  For two dinners an appetizer and two glasses of wine we paid 26 bucks.

All that I can say is get the trash can lid full of food you get all your favorites plus corn fries and slaw.  The Brisket here is awesome!  The ribs are very good! Not as big as shanes BBQ but still good.  The smell alone is enough to make you hungry!  The service is pretty good, drinks are overpriced but that seems to be the new standard nowadays.  The Portion size is huge.  You will be taking some home.  My favorite is the RIb Tips.  You get three times more rib meat and half the price of a rack.  You will not be disappointed.  This place is not for calorie watchers.   The sauces are awesome too.

Got seated right away. Ordered drinks and they arrived fast. Then all went wrong. Waited half hour for refill then got to order food. Ordered the trio platter. Arrived cold and sloppy. The portion size was terrible. The wings were not hot they were dry and tasteless. My nephews kids plate had bigger mini cheeseburgers then mine! and it looks like the steak burrito thing they got on there was taken from a short end piece. The manager took my meal off when I complained but he said next time order something else if I don't like the portion size. Are you kidding me. Next time? How about next time I go to village in which is next door. Food is like Denny's but at least it is served fast, hot, and portions are good. Don't go to this apple bees if you can help it. Find another one. Or go to the Carl's Jr next door you will save money and will be more satisfied.

Located in a little strip mall in Avondale in the Fry's parking lot this is the only Chinese food place that could be considered a mom and pop.  But its not.    First of all this place is over priced.  Its about 9.75-8.75 for a dinner combo and you don't get soup with the meal that was my first complaint.  The second was they skimp out on the meat in the dish and load you up with plain fried rice (its just soy sauce rice basically) and plain soba noodles.  The crab puffs were good the egg roll was OK.  I had the garlic chicken which was nothing special.  It had that fake brown sauce which had no hint of garlic.  I cant believe that these places don't chop fresh garlic into their meals.  Overall I would say avoid this one.  The food is about average and the service is too.  One other thing I asked for hot mustard and yes they brought me out packets like you would find at a fast food place.  Also my grandma asked for lemon for their water and they brought out a lemon packet for that too.  They said they had no fresh lemons :( that pretty much sums it up.

It is what it is.  I like this Pei Wei (WARNING) just do not come here between 1115am-1230pm unless you want to wait for the business crowd.  Its  a favorite location due to being so close to starbucks and right off of 7th ave.  Parking is terrible during these hours also.  If you do want to come here for lunch during your work day I would suggest try getting here at 11am at least you wont have to wait long.  I usually call in and go pick it up if I cant make the 11am window.    The food is good.  As good as pei wei gets.  Its always fresh and the taste and texture is what I would expect.  My favorite is probably the curry chicken.  I ask for extra spicy.  The pot stickers are awesome too they are deep fried though.  They have this chilli sauce by the soda fountain that is killer.  I love it.    Overall I would say not a family friendly place during lunch hours but anytime after the lunch rush is good.  Get your Pei Wei on.

Cupcakes are to die for! Butter creme frosting is the best in town.  I don't see how anyone can not love this place.  Yes the cupcakes are a lil overpriced 3.25 a piece but its totally a little bit of heaven.  I took my Grandma who is the ultimate cupcake critic (like all grandmas)  and she couldn't believe how light the cake was and rich the frosting is.  Simply the best.

Well we made the mistake of going here on a Friday night at about 7pm.  This place was packed.  Strange considering the average price of a dinner is around 20 bucks.  But we decided to try anyways.  I have been here before but that was maybe six years ago.   Upon arrival we went to the hostess table and she told us there would be a two hour wait.  She said that if you wait for a table in the bar you can get one of those tables first come first serve.  So we took a number and hung out in the bar.  About 20 minutes of waiting in the bar we got two seats at the bar.  Lucky.  The bar staff is very friendly and very fast considering this place was absolutely packed!      We ordered two of the specialty drinks called the swamp thing!   they were damn tasty.  I don't know how much alcohol is in one but that's all I needed for the rest of the night!  We also ordered some fried alligator as an appetizer.  The alligator taste like a  cross of fish with a chicken texture.  It is very tasty! The presentation was also nice not messy or greasy.  We then ordered our dinner.    She got the Shrimp Etoufee and I got the Pontchartrain Fish.  The shrimp etoufee came in a smoky sauce with dirty rice.  The Pontchartrain was the fish of the day which was tilapia and had shrimp and crab meat in a butter sauce with dirty rice.  The food is outstanding!  Portion size is fantastic and food served hot and fresh.  The fish has no fishy taste or smell to it.  Its as if it came off the boat and served in your plate.    Overall I say two thumbs way up!  For an expensive dinner this place is worth it.  Date night yes, want to surprise the family with some creole food YES!     Only thing I would say is that come early and hungry! Also if it is date night the bar is the way to go.  You don't even have to get alcohol you can get a soda and order food.

BBQ has to be one of my favorite foods and when a co worker suggested this place I was all for it.  Living on the west side it was quite the drive but being that I am a BBQ fanatic I had to see what this was all about.    First off Lucille's has a good location.  Its located by Dave and Buster in the Tempe Marketplace.  The look of the place is gimmicky but in a Famous Dave's kinda way.  They have old school signs, mason jars to drink out of, and all the little fake things to make you seem like you have gone to Memphis or where ever they are trying to transport you.  The service was absolutely awful.  It took way to long to get drinks and even longer to get refills.  Attitude the whole time.  Here is a tip if you want a good tip bust your butt.  Then you will have more money to pay for your tuition (half the staff is college kids).  And do not roll your eyes when I don't want to try your suggestions.  They tell you they smoke all their meats in house im not impressed.    Now onto the most important part the BBQ.  We had the brisket,half chicken and rib tips with a side of greens and sweet potato fries.   The chicken was good.  It had a smoke on it and was tender not real complaints.  The portion size was good.  Brisket was dry and you couldn't cut it with a fork.  That tough.  Maybe over smoked?  Portion size tiny.  4 strips maybe 3 or 4 inches long.  Rib Tips were dry and covered in sauce.  Hardly any meat on them.  Most places in the valley load you up on Rib Tips when you order they are a cheap meat.  But not this place.  You get a scoop full.  Boo.  Collard greens were disgusting.  Cooked in some weird pork parts and they were bitter.  Greens are not supposed to be bitter if cooked right!  Sweet Potato Fries.  You can't really mess these up they probably came frozen.  So I would recommend these over regular fries.  The starter of a biscuit with sugar on top was just weird.  WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.  And the biscuit wasn't even warm enough to melt the sugar I mean apple butter.   One last thing the house and spicy BBQ sauce's main ingredients are CORN SYRUP thats how they thicken it! seriously that should tell you something.  Overall two thumbs down.  Stay away there are plenty of other great BBQ spots in the valley.

For a good lunch for two under 25 bucks go here.  They don't skimp on lunch sized portions and staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  I had they Gyro and Greek Salad and it came out perfect.  Pita Bread was warm meat was hot and not dry at all.  It was fantastic.  The hummus was good also.  Warm flat bread and very tasty!

BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD  Hands down worst SUSHI in the valley.  First off the sushi portions are terrible.  9 bucks for six pieces while it sounds good the size of the sushi was tiny! I mean small!  We ordered this sushi roll called the Rattlesnake it tasted so fishy we had to send it back.  Its replacement was a spicy yellow fin roll.  The chef must have been mad because that roll was falling apart.    We had the spicy tuna, edamame, and yellowfin regular roll in addition.    My beer Saporo was warm.  We had three different waiters thoughout and our bill was shockingly high.  The sushi chef was texting while he was making sushi if thats any clue. The staff just does not care.  This place needs a makeover bad I feel like calling Gordan Ramsy to have him fix this place because I will never go here again utill there are some major changes.

Hot fresh Asian Cuisine now that's what I am talking about when I think about this place.  I am not sure why they are not as busy as they are maybe its the location.  Its behind an IHOP on Olive and 107th ave.  There is also a Safeway in the parking lot.  The crowd at this place is predominately sun city folks but don't be hesitant these older folks know where the good Chinese is.     First off the service is top knot ch.  This is a family owned restaurant and I always see the same folks as servers.  Water sodas and any thing else you would want comes fast, cold, and refreshing.  They also ask you if you want a refill when they notice your glass is half empty.   Although I have never had a drink here they do serve alcohol here.    The food is fantastic.  The prices are way to low for the amount of food they give you.  6.50 lunch specials give you a entree, noodles,rice,soup,wonton,and egg roll.  And not like other places they have about ten plus items for lunch and dinner combos.  The dinner combos start at 7.50 and include all the above except the portion size is monstrous.  The waiter says its like you buy one get one free.    I recommend any of the chicken dishes, orange chicken is great but my fave is cashew chicken and sea same chicken.   The Mongolian beef is awesome also.  But if you have a favorite chances are they have it in a combo.   They have a huge selection of other dishes if you want to try something not on the combo menu.  Overall I say give it a chance.  These are good people with good food.  I am a regular maybe you will be too.

I hade extremely high hopes for this steak house.  Doing my research for steak houses in Vegas this one always made some of the top list by user reviews.    Service-  I made a reservation well in advance which was good because we were seated right away.  The server was very kind and knowledgeable about the menu.  She answered all our questions.   She told us the specials up front which was nice.  So overall the service was good.  The food-  To start we had the Hot Rock appetizer.  It is pretty gimmicky but its something you have to do.  They basically bring a rock out that is heated to 900 degrees and you cook thinly sliced sirloin on it for a few seconds.  At 17 bucks its pretty pricey for the 6 thinly sliced pieces of sirloin you get.  The flavor was good but price wise they should have included a little bit more meat or something in addition to it.  For our main dish my wife ordered the kobe short ribs 36 bucks and I ordered the ribeye 49 bucks.  We also shared baked mac and cheese and some parker house rolls (they are not on the menu but I recommend because they are free).  The Kobe Short Ribs are nothing to write home about.  For kobe beef it sure tasted about average.  The meat was actually a little under seasoned for my taste.    The Baked Mac and Cheese was great.  The crust on the top was very tasty and the cheese not to greasy.  This side was full of flavor no complaints.  The Ribeye steak.   This is where my whole meal got ruined.  Now a ribeye is my absolute favorite cut.  It is supposed to be juicy and melt in your mouth.  I always pick the most marbled cut that I possibly can when I shop for one and I would expect a high end steak house to do the same.  For starters I got my steak medium rare.  It was absolutely burnt on the outside.  All the wonderful fat was crispy and tasted like pure well burnt no if ands or buts about it.  To give them the benefit of the doubt I cut into the middle which was rare but instead of a tender peace of meat my steak knife had trouble cutting it.  It was rubber!  I couldn't get passed the burnt parts to fully enjoy my 49 dollar steak.  I was expecting luxury but it came out no better then something you could get at Denny's.  It ruined my whole dining experience.  The cook must have been having an off day because the table behind us sent back their steaks also.    Overall for the value I would avoid this place.  There are better steakhouses who take pride in what they serve to their customers.  Just because you charge a fortune does not mean you are good.    I am giving this place a one star simply because I was expecting something amazing and got all my hopes dashed.   To be fair the manager did agree with my complaints about the steak and refunded us for it.

Unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat don't expect the best service.  Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection.   I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .    My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.    Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.    Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.    Two thumbs way down.

Ribs are the best here! Better then famous daves and you don't have to wait 30 minutes.  This is a good rib place if you want something to eat before you go to the movies!

For a native new yorker this one is pretty good.  are you looking for a bar to go to after a hockey or football game and don't want to fight the westgate crowd go here.  Prices are similar to most chain restaurants.  Wings are tasty and many different flavors.  Burgers are very good and there is a beer special everyday and not a small beer a big one for 3 bucks cant beat that!.   They have a good wing special on Tuesdays that is just awesome.  I go here for the wings not the best in phoenix but good price and served fresh not dry like some places or over fried.

Z pizza is outstanding value for gourmet pizza. I usually go here for lunch as I work downtown and its just a quick walk. For 7 bucks you can get two slices and a soda not too bad. On average there are about 6 speciality slices to choose from. Today I ate the Moroccan and the Italian followed by a single slice of pepperoni. The staff is super friendly and the little pizza place is nice and clean. This is a good place to enjoy lunch and have a view of the light rail. It makes you feel like you are truly in a metro! Pizza is a little bit buttery, the slices are thin and the toppings are fresh. Good Pizza!

Wow haven't had such a pleasant dining experience in quite sometime.  First off to be fair to other so called Cajun places in the valley while you are quite good, nothing compare to true Louisiana Cajun and boy that's what this is.    To start this is literally a mom and daughter joint!  They opened last year and are starting to get quite the following.  The location is a bit tricky but take the ten to dysart road make a right at Rancho Santa Fe and go into the parking lot of LA fitness and Walmart.  The restaurant is located right in front of the LA fitness.  We made the mistake of going to the other side of the road as most people do.    Inside the decor is quite simple chairs tables, condiment table with forks hot sauce and napkins the typical.  One side of the wall is dedicated to Louisiana State football so if your a Louisiana state football fan you are in good company.    The food is very good priced.  I started with the gumbo which had all types of seafood as well as rice and an absolutely fabulous broth.  It has to be the best gumbo in town.  They don't put okra in it which kind of takes away the traditional gumbo taste but the cook told me that they do that because a lot of people don't like the okra around here.   I loved it all the same.  Today was the special gumbo and it had fresh oysters in it.  Melt in your mouth Gumbo!  For my main dish I had the catfish, craw-fish and the red beans and rice.  The catfish and craw-fish were both spicy seasoned not spicy hot.  Which helps with not to take away the flavor of the meat.  I was stunned at how both of these fish had no fishy taste to them at all.  It was as if they were caught on the bayou and served to me minutes after the big catch.   The catfish was specially good.  It had a homade cornmeal crust fried to perfection and not goopy take away the flavor fried but perfectly lightly fried.   The craw fish were fried in an absolutely melt in your mouth buttery salty spicy batter again not to over bearing.  The fried stuff comes with some special tarter that is oh so tasty.  The red beans and rice will make you wanting more.  The texture is right on and the flavor is that southern spicy mouth watering rich red beans and rice like mom used to make.  They are addicting.  My girl got the catfish and dirty rice.  Again if you love dirty rice and I mean in a traditional way this is right on the money.    Overall I think I found a new eat out place.  It is well worth the money and the staff , flavor, and tradition of eating in a place like this makes me wonder how I can bring my self to eat at a chain.  If you want a good home cooked meal with southern hospitality this place is for you.

Pretty cool idea!  Basically they have about ten different frozen yogurts.  You pick a cup size you pick your yogurt.  You can mix match add as much toppings as you want or as little they weight it and you pay per ounce around .32 cents an ounce.  So awesome!  I like the cheesecake with Oreo cookie yogurt.  They have fruit and candy toppings.  This place is basically a make it yourself frozen yogurt shop.  Fun for kids and adults!   We are a big fan.  If you want regular ice cream they sell that too its thrifty ice cream.  They also have shaved ice and smoothy's.  This is a mom and pop owned frozen treat shop.  Its in a little corner of the shopping center so its easy to miss but so worth it.

This place just opened up three weeks ago and man it is great.  Don't be too intimidated by the place because they are still fixing it up.  Its best described as a start up sports bar.  The prices are pretty good for a new place.  It sits right on the corner of 83rd ave and has a little dirt lot outside.    We got the hot wings which were very good.  The sauce is homemade with a kind of smoky/southwest spicy taste to them.   They were very good!  The bar serves drinks that are tall or short.  The drinks were pretty good too.  Bartender very knowledgeable.  The staff is very friendly they have plenty of hopes for this place.  My only complaint is the crowd.  While I was told that this place will start to have a DJ and Live band it seems like the crowd here is very diverse like it is fighting as to what type of people will take over this bar and grill.  If you are heading to westgate this is a great pre drink spot as the drinks are very cheap!    I would recommend this spot to anyone wanting to try a new bar and see the hard work and effort it takes.  This is a great place and has plenty of potential to be awesome.  Check it out its worth at least one drink.

We found this place through a giant billboard off the ten and while the billboard suggest wonders beyond our imagination I have to be honest.  This buffet is not 5 stars.  The food is good.  Nothing too special.  You can find the same exact buffet Chinese food at almost all low priced Chinese places.  They seem to have more options then most which may or may not entice you to go here.  What sold us was the Mongolian grill.  But to our dismay you don't get to pick what sauces and the topping options are very limited. Also the meat looked liked it had been sitting there a while.  The chef that cooked our plates through every sauce he had behind the counter on our dish which turned it into burnt blackness.    They do have a sushi counter with "fresh sushi" I doubt its of a grade that wouldn't make you sick.  I would avoid sushi at a buffet unless you are in Vegas.    They have about 4 rows containing different type of rows.  2 and half are deep fried foods and the rest are just typical buffet stuff.  The desserts are the same flavourless ice milk and semi sugar cakes you get at almost all Chinese buffets in the valley.    The inside is pretty dirty the floors were a mess when I got there.  Its kind of like they struggle to keep up.  The buffet areas were clean though.    Overall I would say this is a good bet if you want to gourde yourself as its only 25 bucks for 2 people.  You can eat and eat and eat and be full all day.  But other then that I would avoid.

McFadden's found away to make a novelty out of an Irish pub.  Although they didn't do a very good job as Irish pubs are usually awesome.    The service is OK.  Our waitress was really nice.  We had 3 by the time the night was over.  The food is not terrible and is eatable but if you are looking for something worth the money you will be disappointed.  The portions are fine but a ten dollar burger is just a ten dollar burger.  Flavor was over salty and too much pepper.  The BBQ sauce sugary and the cheese lacked flavor even though it goop-ed off!  The French Fry portion was nothing to write home about either.  A plastic cup of beer (Stella) will set you back 5 bucks for maybe 12 oz.  They do have days with drink specials but I went to one of these and they water down the drinks.  I also went to a party where the drinks were only 1 buck and again it was a weak drink.    Bottom line is this place over priced, over hyped, and over used as a meeting spot.

While the food was ok it was just that.  It's hard to make a burger taste bad I mean it's a burger add bacon and cheese and you are good to go.  Blu burger is a new joint in park west over at northern ave on the west side.  The decor is nothing fancy painted blue inside all over and it is pretty basic I thought it would be a little bit more trendy.    The service was absolutly terrible the waitress too ten minutes to ask fir our drinks ten minutes to bring them then she left and ten minutes later she came back for our order after a manager asked if we had put it in.    Food arived quick my burger while tasty wasn't worth 11 bucks I had the blu burger which is the angus half pounder with bacon and grilled onions and cheese.  My side was sweet potatoe fries and they were good but cold.  The waitress never asked if I wanted ranch or hot sauce or anything.    In all I would say for a gourmet burger this isn't your place it's ok at most.  If u want a burger before the movie it may work for you.

Green Produce What? Fresh Meat you say? Huh? Cheap Prices and Unique Items? What are you talking about?    Oh I know I'm talking about Fresh and Easy!  This place rules.  They have 98 cent specials everyday on good products.  I always stock up on celery and green bell peppers every time I go.  They always have the best meats.  If you want a steak and want to blow your family away with flavor go here right before you grill and you will be shocked at the difference between how the meat taste here vs the supermarket.  I regularly pick up whole chickens for about 3 bucks and roast them.    They also have their own brand of foods which I wont lie are very very good quality.  I'm not a big fan of their pre-made foods but I do love their prices on things from Nutella to breads and desserts.    This is the perfect place to get just what you need. You can easly fill up a shopping cart in under half an hour!.  So its the way to go for after work shopping.  There wine selection is great too.  You can get pretty nice quality wines for under 5 bucks.  Why break the bank.  You think your a wine snob?  Well hide your pride and pick up 4 bottles for under 20.    Whats cool is they also adjust their prices to try and match or beat other supermarkets.  My favorite things here  Hummus Bread Goods Desserts Vegetables Wine Prices  Give Fresh and Easy a Chance!

Smash burger is one of those chains that is kind of not like a chain if you know what I mean.  It has a homemade feel to it similar to what u would find at a mom and pop place but clearly it's not.  But. Don't take this as a let down because this place has some pretty tasty burgers!  I had the Arizona burger it had habanero cheese, jalapenos and a spicy sauce.  The burger wasn't as hot as it sounds but pretty tasty.  The meat was mouth watering and the freshness did show.  We shares some smash fries they were ok kind if greasy but not too bad.    Overall I would recommend this as the burger spot on the west side.  If your out and about over here give it a shot.    Oh and they do have beer.

Ate here last night and was very impressed.  A lot of other reviews for this place are dead on.    First of all the place is right off of 51st ave the bright yellow sign is easily visible from Northern which was a plus because I thought it might be dug deep into a strip mall.  Its actually right on the corner of one.  At first glance from the outside this may seem like a place where you would immediately say no way and back out.  But don't.  The inside of this Thai place is very well decorated and the vibe is just positive.  It is very neat on the inside.  Carved wood tables,little Buddha statues,and just overall decorated in Thai.  It is very unique compared to others I have been too.  If it wasn't for the service this would easily be a 5 star.  It is a mom and pop place which means that there is two servers who serve as waiter,busser,and hostess.   They go around the restaurant and serve the whole place not just certain areas.  It took us a while to place our order but once we did the food arrived fairly fast.  The food was awesome.  Probably some of the best Thai in Arizona if not the best.  It is all served family style which works because the portions are so huge.  We had the lemon grass soup,the basil chicken,and the red curry.  The lemon grass soup was oh so tasty.  Little hints of lemon grass followed by a smooth broth with tons of mushrooms and chicken my mouth waters thinking about it.  The basil chick by far was the best dish.  The grill taste is indescribable.  The sauce had us almost licking the bowl it was so good.  The red curry was fantastic although not as spicy as I would have liked it but still good.    Overall very  good I was impressed.  41 bucks for 3 dishes 1 beer and 1 glass of wine not too bad.  This is a great date night place.    Warning:  Hot means hot here! and I mean Arizona hot!  We got our dishes hot and I was sweating.  Which I haven't done in a long time.  Enjoy!

30 bucks for a full service wash and oil change I am sold.  Good deal. Whats even more awesome is the coupons you can get in the paper, online, and after the wash.  The lube shop is quick, and they wont try to sell you unecessary things.  The free full service car wash is a plus.  Why would anyone go to a stand alone lube shop when they can come here and get an awesome wash and a oil change and not spend 2 hours.    Total time for my trip was 25 minutes  In the time I got a full service wash plus interior (included tires and rims) Oil Change and Filter  33 bucks including tax.

Located on Scottsdale Rd this place is pretty easy to find.  Its right across the street from the sugar bowl.  Sandwichs are great footlong panini's basicly.  The half salad and sandwich is the best deal their salads are amazing.  Fresh lettuce and dressings.  The owners are really friendly also.    But here is the best part! French Pastry! They have crepes and crousants!    Give it a shot for lunch you will be happily surprised.

Tjs is a fantastic place for breakfast on the weekend.  Good old fashioned country food with big portions and cheap prices.  The food here is quality.  It is a mom and pop joint and they take pride in there place it shows a lot of the customers are regulars and they know them by name.  They have a back lot for extra parking.    I had the green chili omelet the salsa was to die for and my wife had the sausage and egg plate her links were huge !  Coffee filled fast and servers were kind and wonderful.    They have pretty much anything you can want that is breakfast fare.  They are well known for the bacon and biscuits and gravy. The location is pretty easy to get to just head south on dysert and the place will be on the right side of the road.  They take credit and debit also.   Give it a shot for breakfast it's totally worth it!

Buffet used to be our favorite chinese spot on our side of town that was until we came on a Monday night.  The service is good and the options and selection is good.  This place has Mongolian BBQ, Sushi, and all the typical Chinese Buffett fair.  It is pretty clean for the most part.  They do not replace items as much as I think they should so I find that some of the food taste lets just say not so fresh.  If you go here go on the weekend and use a coupon.  They have pretty cheap beer so I suggest getting one of those too.  I would also suggest only going on the weekend or when they are busy because they do not replace the food at all on the weekdays when its not busy.  They let it sit there until it gets eaten.

Short Review:   Whisky:  They have a ton of whiskey's to chose from if whiskey is your thing we had the whiskey flights for beginners and I was happy overall with the quality and price in the flight.  The whisky's were very smooth.  Service:  Very good and knowledgeable of the menu  Atmosphere: Pretty cool its kind of hard to explain but its more of a lounge then a typical sit down place.  They have a few different types of eating areas.  We ate at one that had low chairs and kind of a coffee table height table.  (hard to describe) .    Food:  I had the whisky king burger and my wife had the pulled sandwich.  We both shared some duck fat fries.  The duck fries were very good a little different then regular fries I found the insides sort of creamy.  The portion size is decent.  My wife's sandwich was awesome it had a nice smoke flavor to it that kind of reminded me of meat cooked over a camp fire.    Now to the Burger.  For 26 bucks this burger had better blow me away.  I can tell you with absolute honesty this is the BEST BURGER in ARIZONA hands down.  I love burgers and have tried them all over.  This one has made my top three list.  If is was not for the price it would be my number one.  But its worth it to treat yourself to this.  The burger was juicy and the topping succulent.  From the bacon to the blue cheese to the Foie Gras.  This burger will blow you away.  I made a video to show all of you how awesome it is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtyvgotbtEM  .   If your in Scottsdale and you can afford a treat get one of these burgers.  If you are a burger foodie you have to try it.  Oh burger I can't wait for our next encounter!

Salut Rocks they have 1 dollar bottle of wine for happy hour! I had the Italian Panini it was so good and we also shared the Smores dessert OMG so wonderful! I would eat here again in a heart beat.  The atmosphere is comfortable and crowd is a friendly one.  Tempe has a little gem with this place!

4 Stars Because of a few factors  BBQ is awesome, moist delicious and seasoned perfectly with smoke, herbs and more.  We had the turkey, lean brisket, beans, corn on the cob and cream corn.  To compare with other bbq joints they only serve meals family style meaning that if you are looking for a combo meal this isn't the place.   I would say this is probably the best BBQ on the west side hands down.  The bbq quality and flavor rivals that of someone with a famous name.  The bbq sauce didn't impress me though.    How this BBQ joint works:   This is the place for sharing bbq with family and friends.  Each meat is weighed by the half pound right in front of you.  There are no servers.  You go up to the counter and order and there is basically not wait as the person behind the counter goes and gets your order right away from the cooks cutting the meat and such also behind the counter.  Its a bit chaotic at first but I can see how the system works.  You also have to pick up your drinks before you hit the front counter as well.  The line is a bit weird as it snakes around the restaurant.  Someone in line said it was like waiting for a ride at disney.    So overall I would say you should blaze a new trail.  The lines look long but they go fast.
