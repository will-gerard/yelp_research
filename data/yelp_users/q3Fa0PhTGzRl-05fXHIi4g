This was my first experience with Thai food and I am proud to say I am now a believer!  Showed up at 8:30 on a Tuesday night, the hours said they closed at 9:00 so I was a little worried they wouldn't be very happy with us but we were greeted with a smile and taken to a table.  It took a little bit longer than normal for our waitress to come take our order but she was especially friendly so it wasn't too bad.  We ordered the Turtle Island Crab appetizer, I got the Beef Mangone (I didn't want something too crazy on my first adventure with Thai food!) and my friend ordered the Pad Cha Seafood.  The Turtle Island Crab was amazing!  My only issue with it is that I wanted more!  The wonton crackers were perfectly crispy, the crab and avocado blended together great and the dipping sauce that it came with was sweet with just a little kick.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it again!  My Beef Mangone was equally as impressive when it came out.  The presentation itself was beautiful and once I dug in, the flavor didn't disappoint either.  The beef was tender, the sauce had a bit of a kick but nothing crazy and the veggies were cooked perfectly and complemented the meat nicely.  I was nervous to try my friend's Pad Cha Seafood because it had been rated 3 peppers which equates to "Thai Hot" but I was glad I got the courage to do so because it was delicious too!  Everything was again cooked perfectly and the sauce was pretty hot but not unbearable.  I can't wait to go again and find something else to try!

With the end of the year coming and the realization that it'd been about 2 years since I'd been to the optometrist I made an appointment for an exam just in case.  I of course searched Yelp to see which place looked the best and Central Phoenix Eye Care was in the top ranks so I made my appointment with them.  When I called she let me know that all of the patient paperwork was available online to fill out and print to bring with you and save time, something I'm always a big fan of.  When I arrived the ladies at the front were very friendly and gave me one more form to fill out that wasn't available online so it wasn't something I'd missed, but it was short and didn't take long to fill out.  After a little bit someone came out and took me back to do the pre-exam tests with all the fun eye machines that look like arcade games.  After that it was into the exam room to wait for the doctor.  All the tests looked good and then it was onto the fun part, trying on different colors of colored contacts!  They were really patient and helpful with me, I tried a ton of different colors and I never felt rushed or like he was trying to get rid of me.  In fact he was suggesting more for me to try!  At the end of the appointment when I went to check out I was a bit taken aback by the total, I knew that I had a $15 copay so that's what I was expecting to pay but she quoted me $65.  Apparently there's a $50 fee for the exam for contact lenses, not a huge deal but I still wish they would have told me that ahead of time when they'd asked if I was interested in contacts or not.  Still everyone was friendly and I had a good experience.

I've been on a hiking kick lately and am trying to find different ones to try.  Decided to try Piestewa Peak (or Squaw Peak depending on who you ask) but was going to meet up with a friend for lunch beforehand and we found Moto not too far away.  I got there first, a little before 11 which is when they open.  There were a couple people waiting but nothing outrageous.  I walk in and get acknowledged right away by the bartender who lets me know that someone will be right up to seat me and sure enough, as he was finishing that statement the waitress came over and took me to a table.  She also brought me water right away which always makes me happy.  While I was waiting for my friend to show up I read over the menu and was super excited to find out that not only do they have All You Can Eat Sushi, but that it was happening RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT!!  Apparently it's on Saturdays from 11-2:30 and there's 10 different rolls you can choose from for $18.99 (there are some nigiri options too but I don't remember how many there were to choose from for those).  Once my friend showed up I quickly told him about the All You Can Eat special so then he perused the menu to see which ones he wanted.  Our waitress kind of went MIA at this point so that was a little annoying but she seemed to be the only server there so I can't fault her for that but seriously you would think that the management there would keep the place a little bit better staffed on a weekend day during an all you can eat special.  Once our waitress came by for our order my friend got the Tootsi Roll, the Vegas Roll and the Alaska Roll.  I decided that I probably didn't want to binge on sushi right before a hike so I stuck with a single Rainbow Roll.  They took a little bit of time to come out but then again sushi typically does and I'm sure everyone who was in the restaurant was ordering tons of different rolls.  I was happy with the size, the rolls were larger than most places but not so huge that you had a hard time eating a piece.  My Rainbow Roll was delicious!  All the ingredients were fresh and beautiful.  I'll admit I did share one piece of my friend's Vegas Roll (sharing is against the rules according to the menu...oops!) and it was pretty good.  Not the best Vegas Roll I've had but still good.  I'll definitely be coming back here again on another Saturday when I don't plan on hiking so that I can actually partake in the All You Can Eat!

I loved the atmosphere here.  Very classy and lounge-y (is that a real word?).  On a Monday night there were only a few people here but that was nice because it meant my friend and I could get one of the tables with a couch and not have to fight anybody for it.  Right after we sat down our waitress came over to see if we knew what we wanted.  I asked about what kinds of flavored vodka's they had and she wasn't too sure but she did go and check for me which I appreciated.  I went with a Stoli Raspberry and lemonade which was perfect and my friend ordered the Limerick.  He seemed to like it but I thought it was gross, personal preference I guess.  When our waitress made her second trip over I asked if they had any food which I guess they only have on the weekend but she did bring me some pretzels and goldfish which was cute and tided me over until we left and I could get some real food.  She was super friendly the only time and very timely with checking on us and bringing more drinks.  I would definitely come back in the future.

Came back on a Friday night and it was even better.  Friend and I were able to snag a couple seats at the at the bar and had a great time.  If possible try to get Aaron as your bartender, he only works on Fridays and Wednesdays but he was awesome.  He was just asking us what kind of liquor we wanted and creating these awesome drinks for us.  My friend had something with egg whites in it that he loved, another that tasted like key lime pie and I had something called a Sophia Loren that was amazing.  Even the people in the bar sitting next to us were cool.  The atmosphere here is just great.  This is definitely one of my new favorite spots to be.

I think it's pretty evident from all the rave reviews that this place is really good so I'll keep it brief.  I'd heard about this place forever and the bottle of win and bruschetta deal but I hadn't actually been until Monday night with a friend from work.  I was really excited once I saw all the differenct varieties of bruschetta we could choose from.  We ended up getting the Apple/Brie, Burratta/Bacon/Arugula, Salmon/Pesto and the Peppers/Goat Cheese.  All of them were delicious and I can't wait to go back again and try the rest!

Decided on a new fitness program and included in that were a list of supplements I needed to get.  I walked in here and wasn't greeted until I was practically at the counter staring the guy down and even once he finally acknowledged me I felt like I had to drag him around to try to find the things I was looking for.  I would ask where one item was and once he showed me he'd start walking away and I would have to ask him to wait because I needed other things to.  After a couple rounds of that I decided to just find everything myself.  I don't know if he pre-judged me and thought I wasn't going to buy anything because I look young or because I was in gym clothes but either way it was wrong.  The best part was once I had about 3 different things loaded up in my arms he realizes that I was actually going to spend money and maybe he should be more helpful.  THEN he started helping me compare things and explaining different deals they had going on.  At that point I pretty much had everything I needed/wanted so I was ready to go.  At the counter he did give me a $10 off coupon for next month which helped a little bit but I was still irritated with the lack of service I'd been shown originally.

Cinco de Mayo, last minute decide to hang out with a couple friends but don't want to get too loco since we all had to work early the next day.  We figure Gallagher's would be a safe bet and it was centrally located to all of us.  Two of us get there first and walk into a practically empty bar.  I mean, I know we didn't want out of control, but it would have been nice to have SOME kind of background noise going on.  The annoying thing about all this was that even though it was dead the service was S..........L.......O.........W.............  When my friend and I walked up to the bar the bartender didn't acknowledge us and took about 5 minutes to pour a couple beers for the 3 people sitting around.  Once he finally did make his way over to us he wasn't friendly and took his time pouring our two beers as well.  Once we finally had drink in hand we made our way to the patio outside to try to escape the elderly gentleman who had started serenading me and also enjoy some of the springtime air.  Unfortunately it appears that if you sit outside you do not get to enjoy the privilege of a server so we had to venture back inside whenever we needed something.  Luckily for the sake of our evening we had a good time hanging out with each other but no thanks to this place at all.  It would have been practically the same experience if we had gone to a grocery store, purchased some beer there, and then sat in front of the store.  So you better believe that if that's the kind of scenario I'm looking for, I'm gonna save myself the money and do exactly that rather than paying bar markup prices.

Let's be honest, when you walk into a tanning salon if you have high hopes you'll expect to see a nice person behind the counter who is friendly and can tell you the prices for packages and the max times on the beds.  If you have low expectations you'll expect a bored teenager who hands you a price sheet and stares at you looking bored.  Walking into the Total Tan I had pretty good expectations based on the reviews and even those were blown away.  Dallas was the person who helped me (I think he's one of the owners?) and he was sooooo friendly and knowledgeable I spent more than I was originally planning but I feel good about it actually.  I had looked at the pricing online so I had an idea of what I wanted but he explained things about the beds that I never knew and that none of the other salons I'd been to had ever told me.  He was super personable too, even asking for my name just during his explanations of everything before I had committed to buying anything.  He made sure I knew every detail of the beds, the differences, gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it.  During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I don't think he had to ask for their names once, a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers.  I could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself (super clean, trendy, nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels) but I think you get the point by now.  Just check this place out, you'll be happy you did.

Best friend and I were shopping and as that's such a strenuous activity we worked up quite an appetite.  She'd been talking about the wings at this place for a whole week since she first tried them so we decided to go so I could check it out too.  The building doesn't look like much from the outside and it'd be easy to miss so make sure you're looking closely!  It's a lot bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside which I was happy about because no one likes a cramped eating space.  We were greeted and seated right away which is always nice and the hostess was friendly.  Our server arrived quickly as well and was also pleasant.  My friend decided on the Honey Hot boneless wings and I went with Medium, we also wanted to try out the pizza so we split a 10" Pepperoni.  The food came out pretty fast which was good because we were hungry.  The wings were a good size, perfectly crispy with the right amount of sauce and they had a great flavor.  The pizza was delicious as well.  We polished off the whole thing and I'm justifying it by telling myself it was small so it's okay.  My only tiny little pet peeve (and this is going to make me sound like a diva...) is that the water tasted like unfiltered tap water.  I hate to bring that up but Arizona water does have it's own special "flavor" and it just wasn't great.  With the exception of that though I loved everything about this place and I will certainly be back soon.

Some friends and I were meeting up for sushi and this place was one of the closest sushi places to their house so we decided to stop by.  It was fairly busy when we showed up but we were seated right away which was nice.  Half of our party (the guys) were going to be showing up a little later but we went ahead and ordered some drinks and appetizers to tide us over until they showed up.  The waitress was nice if somewhat lacking in her knowledge of the menu but we didn't really mind.  After getting our appetizers and initial drinks we really didn't see our waitress, well actually let me rephrase that, we saw her at other tables around us just not at ours.  Now, I understand that we had told her we were going to wait to order until our party shows up so it's not like we expected her to show up and take our whole order, but she wasn't even coming around to fill our water glasses or to check and see if we needed refills.  Once the guys showed up and we ordered the food came out and I was kind of underwhelmed.  None of it was bad but it was all pretty average.  The only thing memorable were the Panko Breaded Onion Rings which were fantastic.  Honestly I would go just for those babies.  As for the sushi I may try a different roll and see if that made a difference and I would definitely hope for a server who's a little more attentive.

It had probably been about 7 years since I'd flown when I booked my flight through Sky Harbor so I was kind of nervous about the whole thing since I didn't feel completely confident about all the crazy rules and regulations people talk about all the time.  My flight was at 7:45 on a Monday morning in September and I made sure I got there 2 hours early because I had no clue how busy it would be.  That ended up being way more time than I needed and I pretty much breezed through security.  I would say from getting off the shuttle to getting to my gate it probably took about 15 minutes tops.  The layout was easy to figure out and the TSA agents were pleasant.  Not the way I had been picturing them in my mind, running at me with metal detectors and requiring a "random" strip search...I think I watch too many movies.  In all seriousness though my trip to Sky Harbor was stress free and easy and encouraged me to start flying more often!

Started coming here every now and then because it's close to where I work so if I don't have time at my home gym I'll make it up here.  I try to avoid that happening though because I dislike this gym that much.  The staff is average as they are at most LA Fitness locations, some are very friendly but the majority just seem bored.  The layout of the equipment seems strange, related body parts aren't really grouped together and the equipment itself is older and not very up to date.  This next thing I know isn't the gym's fault but it's something I've noticed at this location especially and it's male gym-goers ogling a bit too much.  It's really annoying when you're running on a treadmill and a couple guys just stops and stares at you very obviously.  So like I said, I come here if I have no choice but I try to keep it from happening when possible.

This is one of the best Olive Garden's I've been to.  The waitress was very friendly and quick, she took our order right away and all of our food, including the salad and breadsticks, came out quickly.  The food itself seemed better than the other Olive Garden's too, whether it was cooked better or just had a better flavor I don't know but it just altogether tasted better.

I haven't been to an Outback steakhouse in probably about 4 or 5 years but I wanted something different so I decided to stop by.  Our waitress seemed a little busy so it took a bit of time in between her visits but she was so nice and friendly that it made up for it.  I ordered the 10 oz Ribeye and to my amazement it was actually cooked correctly!  It is one of my biggest pet peeves to go to a restaurant, order a steak medium rare and then get it medium well.  If you're not going to cook it right, don't ask!  Moving on though....the Aussie fries and clam chowder were both really good too surprisingly.  I don't usually expect to get good clam chowder at a steakhouse.  The bill was less than I was expecting too which is always a nice surprise.  I will definately be venturing back before another 5 years passes!

I recently signed up here because I moved from Maricopa and didn't really want to make that drive every day to go to the gym.  The first thing I would tell people is that if you want to sign up here, don't take one of the price options they show you at first.  Ask for other options and you'll save about $25 a month and pay a cheaper initiation fee or none at all.  The people at the counter who check you in generally aren't very friendly but they're a very small part of my experience so I deal with it.  I just started personal training today and the trainer, Lance, is great!  He's friendly and I like his training style (more encouragement than drill instructor).  Not to mention I feel like I've been run over by a truck so I forsee good results coming from this.  They have a bunch of different cardio and weight machines and usually have more than one of each so it's not a big deal if someone is on one.  They also have a ton of classes that are included in the membership which I think is great.  Haven't had a chance to try any out yet but I'm definately going to try to get into one soon.

Don't come here if you ever want to be able to go to a Jamba Juice or Orange Julius again.  The smoothies are a-freaking-mazing...I mean, I didn't think a smoothie could taste THAT good.  My friend and I were getting our nails done at the place a block or so over and she wanted to stop here because she said it was one of her favorites.  Not being one to turn down a good smoothie I agreed to go with.  She ordered a Tropical something (had coconut, pineapple and I think apple and banana?  I could be wrong but I know the first two were in it for sure) and added protein powder to it.  I ordered a Strawberry Tropical something (had strawberries, pineapple, oranges and banana).  She let me try hers first and I basically did the taste test equivalent of a double look.  What I mean by that is that I took a first sip and it was so good I had to immediately go back for another to assure myself it was real and take it all in.  This smoothie tasted like some kind of ice cream/smoothie/pina colada/heaven in my mouth!  Normally I don't like adding protein to smoothies because it adds a flavor that throws it off but you couldn't even tell in this bad boy.  It was so good I was nervous to try my own drink because I didn't think it would live up to hers.  Much to my surprise and delight, it was just as good!  I straight up told the manager/owner (?)  that I will never go anywhere else for smoothies again.  Nothing will ever be able to compare.  So like I said, if you want to be able to go elsewhere, don't try this place.  However if you're ready and willing to try the best smoothie of your life then you better get some before I drink them out of business!

I started working right across the street from this Starbucks a couple weeks ago and it's been dangerous to my finances but great for my Skinny Caramel Macchiato fix!  Almost all of the baristas I've come across have been friendly, there was just one guy who seemed kind of bored but he wasn't rude or anything.  My drinks are always made quickly and correctly.

Oh Chipotle, what's not to love honestly?  Great quality ingredients that you can have thrown together in a completely customizable meal, it's hard to go wrong with that set up.  I managed to stop in at a rare time when they didn't have a huge line and made my way up to the counter.  The people behind the counter greeted me with a smile and a "hello" right away, and proceeded right away to get my order taken care of.  The girl who rang me up was very friendly too and even put a smiley face on my container!  Call me a sucker for the small stuff but I love things like that!

I was in the mood for something I don't always get for my lunch break last week so I decided to go to Z'Tejas.  I'd been to their other locations but never this one surprisingly.  The hosts at the front were very friendly, the one who walked me to my table actually stayed and made conversation for a couple minutes which hardly ever happens anymore.  My actual server was very friendly too.  I was very happy to see that they had a Build Your Own bar where you could pick from a Bloody Mary, Mimosa, Screwdriver and one other drink I can't remember and it was incredibly cheap!  Only $4 for my Bloody Mary!  They had a wide variety of choices too as far as juices, fruits, vegetables, seasonings, sauces, it was hard to decide!  For my actual entree I ordered the Hickory Burger which has barbecue sauce, chopped onions, bacon, jalapeno mayonnaise and a couple different cheeses.  It was delicious!  Kind of a mess to eat but worth every splatter you get on your face and shirt.  I just wouldn't recommend ordering it if you're with someone you're trying to look dignified in front of... The fries were great too.  Nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  I was definitely happy with my decision to switch up my lunchtime location and I will for sure be coming back in the future.

I DIDN'T GET CARDED HERE!  For most of you that wouldn't be a big deal but when you look like you're 16 like me, it's a pretty big thing when you don't have to pull out your wallet and grab your ID to order a martini.  All jokes aside though I had an awesome experience at the Keg.  Service was exceptional from start to finish, I'm so mad I don't remember the waiter's name but he was awesome, totally attentive and made sure everything was just the way we wanted.  Since we had never been before he explained the menu to us and gave us his recommendations.  I ordered the Prime Rib Classic with garlic mashed potatos and my date got the New York Strip with the twice baked potato.  The Prime Rib was sooooo good!  It was cooked perfectly, very tender and had a great flavor!  I'm so glad I took the waiter's advice and went with that.  The garlic mashed potatos great too.  My date's steak was had a really nice flavor as well but I didn't try his potato.  For dessert we shared the Creme Brulee which was also spectacular.  The crust had a wonderful texture and flavor and the custard was the perfect compliment to it.  I can't wait to go back but next time I think I'll plan for it by not eating the whole day before so that I can actually finish my plate!

Finally made it out here with my co-workers on Monday night and I was so glad I did!  Apparently Monday is karaoke night and I was laughing so hard I was crying.  There was a very eclectic mix of people so the songs and dance moves were at both ends of the spectrum.  The prices were great, I got there late (around midnight) so I didn't order too much but my bill for a Vodka Red Bull and 10 wings was only around $7!  The wings were kind of small and didn't have a ton of meat but the flavor was good and the drink was made well.  I forsee many Monday nights here laughing until I cry so next time I'll come prepared and make sure my mascara is waterproof!

I'm so happy that I found a good Mongolian grill!  I used to go to them all the time when I lived in Washington and I was worried I wouldn't be able to since I moved.  I actually went her on accident, I couldn't find the place I had been planning on going to so I went here instead.  That turned out to be a very good idea.  It's only about $10 and you can go through the buffet as much as you like, there's a couple different soups you can get, drinks and an ice cream machine too.  The bowls for the meats and veggies are HUGE!  It was nice being able to fit everything I wanted into the bowl the first time and not having to make multiple trips.  They have a very large variety of sauces and a sort of menu of how many spoonfulls of each different flavor you need to make specific sauces (orange sauce, teriyaki, etc.).  The staff was all friendly and made sure that everyone knew how it worked and gave recommendations for the sauces.  The guys grilling the food were really fast too, not that I would mind if it was slow since it's so much fun watching them cook everything.  The food itself was sooo good!  I don't know if it was the mixture of sauces I used or  the noodles or what but it was better than the other Mongolian restaurants I'd been to before.  I'm definately going to be returning here although next time it will be on purpose!

When you don't get off work until midnight and your clientele are people who have been travelling all day you often find yourself needing a drink (or seven) and something to eat.  I happened to find myself in this position last Friday night and so a co-worker and I decided to stop by to decompress.  We chose Applebee's because its kitchen stayed open until 12:45 and we definitely needed some food.  We got there around 12:30 and felt kind of bad ordering food but the bartender assured us it was no problem at all and that she was happy to do it.  Her name was Mary and she was awesome!  Super friendly, she was joking around with us all night, not to mention she was really attentive too, always making sure we had everything we needed whether it was getting our drink order in before last call or condiments for our food.  As we were walking out a couple other employees wished us a good night and welcomed us to come back again.  I know it's a small gesture but it makes you feel good and I will definitely be returning for my next decompression session (look I made a rhyme!)

Was driving down the street and saw the Einstein sign as I was almost about to pass it.  Luckily for me there were no other cars in my way and I veered across two lanes of traffic to make it into the parking lot.  The place was so deserted out front that I actually had to check Yelp to see if they were open, confirmed they were then made my way inside.  The place was completely empty so I made my way right to the front.  However once I got up to the counter there was no one there to help me.  Now, I'm not 100% sure a bell went off when I walked in but I'm pretty sure it did, you know, to alert the people in the back when someone walks in in just this kind of example.  I could hear a group of people talking and laughing in the back but no one was coming out to check on the front.  I also noticed a camera pointing at the counter, not sure if that's for management to watch the staff or for the staff to watch for customers but either way it wasn't helping me get a bagel any faster.  After a few minutes a girl finally walked out to help me and didn't act very apologetic about the lack of service.  Once she took my order another girl went through the process of actually toasting and preparing my bagel and she was quick and polite.  The bagel itself was as good as I knew it would be and I'll go back to other locations but the service I received at this particular one will definitely prevent me from returning here.

When I walk into a Mac store I feel like a little kid walking into a candy store.  I get this glow about myself and I'm just in awe of all the pretty things around the room.  Unfortunately for my wallet the prices aren't quite as affordable as candy but I make sacrifices (why pay for my water bill when I can buy mascara instead?!  Kidding!  But I've thought about it....)  Walking into this location was no different and the service was on par with what I expect as well.  I was greeted right away when I walked in and the rep came over to see if I needed help with anything.  I already knew what I wanted but just had questions about which color would be right for me.  The rep made a recommendation and then applied it onto me to make sure it was what I wanted.  Easy and professional.  While I was paying, a couple of the other reps complimented my dress and one of my tattoos so we got into a conversation about them and by the end of it I was pulling up my Instagram because they wanted to see pictures of my other tattoos too!  It was like they were friends of mine which is the kind of customer service I love, makes me feel welcome and it makes me want to continue to go because I know I'll have a great experience every time.

After I walked back from the range the guy at the counter said I had a glow about me...I think that pretty well describes how much I loved this place.  Decided to check this place out today because of the Ladies Shoot Free Fridays, can't really beat that kind of a deal.  A friend and I walked in and while we've both shot guns before we didn't really know how to do anything besides pull the trigger and try not to hurt ourselves or anyone else.  I was a little nervous about that because I didn't want to feel stupid but I really wanted to do this.  I had nothing to worry about, the guy that helped us was totally cool and showed us absolutely everything without making us feel dumb for not knowing.  We started with a 9mm handgun to get warmed up and chose the Zombie Justin Bieber for our targets.  Let's just say that Justin didn't survive...  After we finished off our boxes of ammo we decided to try something different so we decided to pull out the big guns, literally!  We knew we wanted a rifle and the guy recommended the AR15.  It was awesome!  Not too much kick but big and loud and therefore lots of fun!  I have a feeling coming here on Fridays (and maybe even more) is going to become a part of my weekly routine.  It's just so much fun and great for getting out your aggression in a safe environment, kinda like fun therapy!

I have a cream colored comforter and a black dog who likes to sneak up onto it in the middle of the night when I'm passed out and can't tell him no.  Needless to say the dog hair shows up pretty obviously and it got to a point where I couldn't handle the way it looked anymore.  Zest was close by and had good reviews so I took it to them to take care of.  The price was good and it only took a couple days to get back.  Once I got it home and unwrapped it I was so happy!  It looked great, no more dog hair and it smelled nice and clean.  I will definitely go back again!

I feel like Barro's is so good it barely even needs a review so I'll keep it brief. I put in an order for pickup, showed up a little early but it was ready to go so I didn't have to wait.  The girl at the counter was friendly and of course the pizza itself (a mini White pizza, perfect for 1 person!) was delicious.  I'm obviously going to be coming back.

I had a moment of clarity where I realized I sat around watching TV far too often and was losing too many brain cells; therefore I decided to try and find a library and start reading to become a smart kid again!  The Juniper Branch was the closest one too me and I was surprised to find that I actually drive past it a few times a week but it's kind of hidden from the road.  I had signed up for a library card online but needed to go in to actually pick it up.  The lady at the desk was friendly and helpful, the library itself is clean and pretty easy to figure out.  They have quite a few computers available for use and I didn't have any trouble getting onto one right away with the system they use to reserve them.  I really like that you have the option to search for books and then put a hold request in for them on the library's website.  I've used it for several books so far and they come in pretty quickly.  It's very convenient when they are available at this branch as well because they have a huge shelf that they put all the holds onto so you don't have to wait in line for someone at the front desk to help you, you just grab them, go through the self checkout stations they have and you're on your way!

I'd always gone to the Tempe location but one day I drove by this one on accident and realized it's less than 5 minutes from me!  I'd been wanting to get my second tragus done for a while and then their Facebook page announced they were doing their $10 piercing special to benefit some animal rescues, can't go wrong with cheap piercings for a good cause!  Once I got there I decided I wanted to get my rook done too because, why not?  I had a couple questions about it first though and the girl at the counter was able to answer all of them so that I could make an informed decision about it.  Then she gave me the pricing for everything, had me sign the release and told me to wait for a little bit for one of the piercers.  I didn't have to wait too long before Ricky called me up.  He was friendly and makes you feel at ease with what's going on.  He got everything set up and put a couple marks on me so I could make sure I was gonna like the placement.  Everything looked good to me so it was go time.  Luckily for me Ricky was quick and got both of the piercings within a couple minutes.  I was especially happy I'd decided to go with the rook piercing, I'm obsessed with it now!  It was definitely an all around great experience and I can't wait to go back to get my other rook done once these piercings are healed!

Came here to watch the Cards game with some friends a couple weeks back.  Loved that there were lots of TV's playing different games so you could find a good spot no matter where you were sitting or who you were rooting for.  The food was great too, I got the White Pizza which was delicious.  Service was pretty quick too considering how packed the place was.  Definitely enjoyed the place and would go back again for sure.

Like the previous reviewer I had to wait a few hours to write my review because I couldn't lift my arms to type until now!  I had never been climbing before but I'd been wanting to try it so I made one of my friends come with me to try it out.  For $16 you get the shoe rental, harness rental and access to facility.  For first timers they make you watch a video (don't be worried if you don't have every word memorized) and then an instructor goes over everything with you, making sure that you're comfortable with everything before they leave.  There are a bunch of different walls with varying difficulties.  It's a lot of fun trying to stay on the paths they have set up.  A word of advice, they're harder than they look from the ground.  Some of them look really easy and then you fall off three steps up, but it's a lot of fun.  I'm going back on Thursday with a different friend and I'm super excited to try everything again now that I know what I'm doing!

A customer of mine recommended this place to me a couple months back so when a friend and I made plans to meet for lunch I suggested this place.  We got there around 11:30 and while it wasn't packed there were definitely more people than I was expecting for a place that had only been open for 30 minutes so far on a Thursday morning.  The sign at the door said seat yourself so we did and as we were putting our stuff down a friendly waitress came over and handed us our menus and asked about drinks.  We decided to start with waters in order to give us time to peruse the menu for a couple minutes.  Now, personally I feel it would be wrong to go to a place called Philly's and NOT order a cheese steak so I decided to go with the Original Philly which was meat, cheese wiz and grilled onions.  My friend decided on a tuna melt and I tried to avoid eye contact for a little bit so she wouldn't see the look of disappointment in my face.  I liked that there is a big selection of items you get to choose from for the side dish as well.  I went with curly fries and she got onion rings but you could also choose from fruit, steak fries, coleslaw, a salad and a few other things too!  Our food came out pretty quickly and I knew it was gonna be good as soon as I saw the meaty, melty goodness oozing out of it onto the plate.  The roll it was on was perfectly toasted, lightly crispy but still soft, the thing was loaded with meat and the meat itself was super flavorful and then of course you can't go wrong with cheese wiz.  I'm not even embarrassed to admit I ate the whole thing.  I was originally just going to finish half and save the rest for later but it was so good I couldn't resist.  The curly fries were great too, nice and crispy with a good flavor.  Our waitress was great the whole time too, always smiling when she came up to us, good with keeping our drinks filled and checking to make sure we had everything we needed.  My only regret is that I didn't come here sooner.

I will not be returning to this hotel on my future trips to Vegas.  I had booked a pet room as I was traveling with my dog and after checking in and dropping all my stuff off in the room I went in search of a place to take my dog so he could "do his business".  I walked up and down the hallway near my room with my dog on his leash to try and find an employee who could tell me where to take him.  The three people I ran into first didn't speak English.  The next employee I ran into didn't think they had an area (real intelligent, you have pet rooms but no outside pet area, that makes a whole lot of sense....).  So finally after about an hour of just wandering the hotel I finally found it.  No thanks to any of the employees.  The other thing that irritated me was that when the Bell Hop was loading all my stuff out of my car he said that he didn't have room to take my dog's carrier right then and that I could try calling back after 7:00 pm once it slowed down a bit.  Um, I'm sorry but I thought your job was to take whatever I wanted up to my room.  Not that you'll get the easy stuff and then inconvenience me by making me wait to get the other stuff that you don't feel like loading right now.  The only reason that I'm giving the Flamingo 2 stars instead of 1 is because the room service food was good and the valet was free.  But those two things alone do not make up for the lack of service and knowledge of the grounds from the employees.  Save yourself a headache and book somewhere else on your trips to Vegas.

What can you say about a restaurant with over 650 reviews that hasn't been said before?  I had the Jade Red Chicken with Pork Fried Rice, the chicken was great, I ate way more of it than I should have.  I wasn't a big fan of the fried rice but that's probably a good thing because I definitely filled up on the Jade Red Chicken.  The people working were nice and the meal comes with a free Snickerdoodle cookie which is awesome.  Have a feeling this place is going to be dangerous since it's within walking distance from my house...

I want to give this place a 1 star rating but my food was actually pretty good.  The service on the other hand was a COMPLETELY different story.  A couple girl friends and I decided to meet up for dinner on a Wednesday night after work.  When we got here it wasn't slammed but it was definitely busier than we expected.  Since it was nice outside we wanted a table on the patio and were told it would be a 5-10 minute wait but that we could sit at the bar with a buzzer in the meantime.  The hostess was friendly and helpful.  We get to the bar and make our drink orders right away.  When they were brought out the bartender asked if we wanted to keep a tab or pay as we went.  My friend explained that we were going to be moving outside once a table became available and wanted to know if the tab could be transferred over once we did.  He snapped back that we could do it either way, it was up to us but that it would take longer if we transferred it.  Now let me just say that I know reading that line doesn't seem especially rude, but the tone he used was extremely impatient and condescending.  We decided to just pay as we went since it seemed to be such an inconvenience to do anything else.  Another thing that apparently bothered him was one of my friends commented that she thought the beer she ordered was supposed to be darker, which she didn't even say to him, she was just commenting on it.  So he grabs a shot glass, pours the beer into it in front of her, slams it down and says, "See?  That's just what it looks like!"  At this point we were all looking at each other like "What is wrong with this guy?"  Luckily the hostess came over right at that point to let us know our table was ready.  When our waitress came over we already knew what we wanted since we'd been browsing the menus while we waited so we got that out of the way quickly.  We also all got glasses of water.  Our food came out after a reasonable amount of time for how busy they were and as I stated above it was all good.  I got the Chicken Tortilla Soup which was nice and thick, had large chunks of chicken in it and was all around a great combination of flavors.  Unfortunately  after our food was brought out we didn't see our waitress again for probably 20 minutes.  So we were all sitting around with empty water glasses until she brought our check out.  We were not happy campers.  So while I did enjoy the food I don't think I'll be returning with the prospect of receiving this kind of service again.

I decided to give this place another try so when the bestie suggested meeting up for dinner I figured this would be the perfect time since she works right down the road.  We were greeted right away when we walked in and the hostess was able to seat us without any wait.  Our server then came over right away to see if we needed any drinks but he literally came over so quickly we hadn't had time to look over the menu so we just got waters to start.  Once I'd glanced over the menu I decided to go with the Sweet Tart Martini which was a concoction of raspberry vodka, sour apple pucker and tropical punch.  It's hard to go wrong with a mix like that.  For our meal we both decided that burgers sounded good so BFF got the Pepper Crusted Gorgonzola burger and I got the BBQ Bacon burger.  Right after we ordered my martini showed up in all it's turquoise colored glory.  First sip and I was in love.  This thing literally tasted like a sweet tart candy but with alcohol!  Somehow I managed to keep my composure and sip it like a lady rather than chugging the thing like I wanted to.  There was a little bit of a wait for our burgers but it wasn't too bad and we had a good conversation going anyway.  Once they did arrive I was pleased to see that my burger was actually cooked medium-rare as ordered.  I know I mention this a lot in my reviews but a lot of places don't get this right and I like my meat bloody in the middle so it makes me happy when a restaurant can accommodate me with that request.  I was in love with the garlic aioli that came on the side as well!  I was dipping my burger AND fries into that creamy goodness.  All in all I think Yardhouse definitely redeemed itself after my last visit.  The service was MUCH improved and the food was great as expected.

I had always wanted to go to a restaurant like this where they serve the meat to your right at your table and you have such a big variety of choices.  The service was very quick, almost as soon as we had turned our little signal to say that we were ready for food, someone was coming out with a fresh skewer of meat.  All of the servers were very friendly as well.  The food itself was good but not great.  Some varieties of meat were very very salty, others were great.  Luckily they come around with all the different meats multiple times so you can figure out which ones you like and want more of.  I would suggest saving some room for dessert though as there is a multi-tiered cart of different delicious choices.  I tried the Tiramisu and it was some of the best I've had.

Stopped in for happy hour with a friend after work the other day.  It was a little hard to find from the street because it's in what looks like a strip mall.  Once inside though the ambiance was great!  Very cozy, lots of character and I love the big comfy chairs at the tables.  The happy hour selection was good, there were several appetizers and drinks you could pink from so you had some variety.  The service was great too, our waiter was very friendly and kept checking back with us to make sure we had everything we needed.  I ordered the lettuce wraps which were really good!  The flavor combination was wonderful and I loved the different textures from all the different goodies in them which kept your palate interested.

I felt bad about not taking my dog to the dog park as much as I used to but since moving to North Phoenix there's just not a lot of selection.  The one that's closest to me is muddy and gross and the really nice one in Scottsdale is a pretty far drive which is no fun with a dog who wants to run around.  Luckily my best friend mentioned this one which is only about 5-10 minutes from me.  We decided to check it out with our fur babies and see if it was any good.  It's easy to drive past when you're coming up Cave Creek to find it but once you know where it is you won't miss it again.  There is a pretty good amount of parking so I don't see that being an issue.  The area for the dogs is pretty good sized, is all grass so not muddy and there is a doggy drinking fountain and quite a few chairs scattered around.  I noticed that even the area for the small dogs was large so they didn't skimp for the little ones like some dog parks do.  Needless to say my dog had fun, got a bunch of exercise and made some new friends.  Plus there were no dirty footprints left in my car when we went to leave.  I'm very happy I found a good dog park near me so I won't feel like such a bad mommy anymore!

This is definitely my favorite dog park I've found in the area.  It has two big areas, one for passive dogs and one for active dogs.  Both have tons of room for the dogs to run around and water fountains so you don't need to worry about bringing dishes and your own water.  The area is well maintained and surprisingly clean for a dog park as well.  It's mostly grass with some areas being a sort of sand mixture.  I took my dog on a day it was lightly raining and he wasn't completely covered in mud, something I very much appreciated.  The other dog owners were also very friendly and their dogs were well behaved.  I know that that doesn't really have anything to do with the location but I enjoyed that aspect as well.  This park is a little out of the way for me but I'm willing to make the drive just because of how much I (and my pooch) liked it.

Best body piercing shop I have EVER been to.  It was a little busy when I walked in but the guy at the counter, Chris,  greeted me right away and asked what I wanted to get done. I told him and he got all the paperwork started and showed me which jewelry I could choose from for each piercing (nostril and helix). Once I picked them out I still had to wait a little while but he kept a conversation going with everyone so that we were occupied.  The piercer I got was Dana and he was awesome. He's really funny and down to earth which took away any nervousness I had. He showed me a couple different options as far as placement for each of the piercings and didn't waste any time getting to it which I like. He was very quick actually doing the piercings and kept me talking the whole time so that I wasn't thinking about the fact that he was sticking needles into me.  After both piercings were done he made sure I was actually okay and wasn't just saying that to try and look tough.  He walked me out to pay and made sure I understood the care instructions and to feel free to stop by or call if I had any questions.  Chris emphasized that again while he was taking my payment and gave me Dana's card with their contact information and also the sizing of the jewelry I got. I left trying to think of what else I want to get pierced just because I had such a great experience there. I will definately be going back soon!

This is a great dog park to have in the area.  It has a ton of room for the big dogs to run around and there are baggies and trash cans scattered all around it so you don't have to go far to pick up after your dog.  I also love that there are a couple water stations in case you don't bring your own water bowl.  The area for the small dogs looked to be a pretty decent size as well.  The only downside to this dog park is that the ground is pretty muddy so I'd recommend wearing shoes you don't care about and bringing extra towels to clean up your pup after they're done.

Have you ever walked into a tanning salon only to be "greeted" by some snotty little teenager who thinks she's God's gift to earth?  That is an experience you will not have to endure here!  The girl sitting behind the desk was super friendly and knowledgeable which made me feel welcome and happy to be there.  She gave me a tour of all the different beds they offered and made sure that I knew what the differences were and what features they had.  The plans that they have are a lot less expensive than the other tanning salons I've been to around here and the beds are some of the best I've seen.  I can't believe I finally found a tanning salon that I can afford to go to where the beds are awesome and the people there are nice to me!

A group of us girls decided we wanted to do something different one night, so we ended up at The Rock for the Barbara Seville drag show.  None of us had been to a drag show before so we didn't really know what to expect.  We were pleasantly surprised with what we got.  The music acts were great and the commentary in between was hilarious!  I loved how much they all interacted with everyone in the audience.  I can't wait to go back again!  Also, you've probably seen this in the reviews already but make sure you bring some singles.  You'll feel left out if you don't!

A few days before Christmas I got a cold (pretty typical for me), sore throat, cough, the works basically.  Like normal it started going away after a little while though so I didn't worry about it.  The weird thing though was that the cough never went away.  Then a couple days ago it started getting worse!  I decided I should probably get it checked out to make sure it wasn't something serious.  Dignity Health was near my work and able to get me in right away so I stopped in to see them.  The girl at the front was friendly and got me signed in quickly.  After a few minutes another nice lady came to take me into the back and get all my information.  Once that was finished she took me to a waiting room for the actual doctor.  He was also friendly when he arrived and asked lots of questions and checked out my lungs to figure out what was going on.  Apparently I had Bronchitis so he gave me a prescription for some antibiotics to help take care of it.  Everyone I dealt with was friendly, knowledgeable and I was in and out within a reasonable amount of time.  As much as you don't WANT to need to go to an urgent care center, if I have to again in the future I would make sure to come here.

I've probably driven by this location a couple hundred times on my way to the gym each day and I finally decided today I was tired of being the whitest girl in my group of friends.  I had checked out the website previously to look at pricing and packages so I pretty much knew what I wanted when I went in.  The girl behind the counter was very friendly and you could tell she was knowledgeable about everything which is always a comforting feeling.  I signed up for the basic package which gives me unlimited access to level 1 and 2 beds and it's only about $32 a month.  I was able to get into a bed right away and the girl recommended a time for me since it had been a while since I'd been tanning.  Her recommendation turned out to be a good one as I didn't burn but can see a little color starting to come through.  I'm very happy to have found a nice, clean place to tan with good pricing that's convenient to get to as well.  Hopefully I'll be about the same color as the rest of my group by bikini season!

If you have not tried the Lemon Pepper wings and the fries here, you need to stop whatever it is you're doing and go to Wingstop NOW!!  A friend of mine always used to get them and the idea of lemon pepper just didn't appeal to me but one day I felt like something different so I decided to try them.  Once I did I was mad at myself that I hadn't done it sooner!  The wings are perfectly crispy, the balance of flavors between the lemon and the pepper is mouthwatering and the fries are some of the best I've ever had with a sort of sweet and savory seasoning on them that I can't figure out but I'm obsessed with.  The one thing I will say is that if you like your fries crispy you'll need to order them "well done."  If you don't they're still good but a little too soft for me personally.  I also love that they have Strawberry Fanta, it just tops off the perfect meal.

Apparently people in Maricopa think of April Fool's Day as a major holiday that requires going out to eat because I can't think of any other reason a restaurant would be as packed as this place was on a Thursday night at 8:00.  Maybe it's the food...  When we got there we were told that there was a wait but if we didn't mind eating in the bar then we could go sit down right away.  We opted for that rather than sit around for who knows how long.  The hostess handed us our menus and we just picked a table that was free.  It took a while for the waitress to take our order, so long in fact that my husband asked if I wanted to go somewhere else, I figured we'd just wait it out and see what happened though.  Once the waitress did come around for our order she was friendly which made us not feel so bad about waiting.  She was quick with bringing our drinks, appetizer and the food.  Something we weren't expecting given our first impressions.  The food was AWESOME!  We started with the potato skins which were larger than most restaurants normally serve and had tons of melted cheese, real bacon and fresh scallions.  My husband had the House Calzone which was delicious.  The flavors all worked really well together.  I had the grilled chicken Ceasar Salad and it was probably the best one I've had.  The chicken had a great flavor from the grill, there was just the right amount of dressing that you could taste it in each bite but it wasn't drenched and there was real cheese on it that gave it just the right extra flavor.  We were even more pleased when we got our bill and it was a lot less than we usually spend at a restaurant.  After tip we spent about $35.  Not too bad if you ask me.  We will most certainly be returning!

Just went here again and it was even better than the first time!  It wasn't as busy so we were seated right away and our waitress was AWESOME!  Her name was Danika and we're going to be requesting her everytime now.  Super friendly, knew about the menu, constantly making sure we had everything we needed and she made great recommendations (you HAVE to try the Chocolate Chip Cookie Sundae, ask her to describe it though, it's really funny!).

This place makes some awesome pizza!  I read the reviews and everyone talked about how great the White Pizza was so I tried that and then just a plain jane Pepperoni.  The White pizza has a bunch of different types of cheese and is almost more like cheesy bread with crust than pizza, but still yummy nonetheless.  The Pepperoni was one of the best I've had, it had great flavor, just the right amount of sauce and the crust was very good too.  The only thing that kind of sucks about them is that they stop taking delivery orders at 10:00 which is a bit earlier than I'm used to but I guess I probably shouldn't be eating that late anyway.....

When a place has over 500 reviews there really isn't much to say so I'll keep it simple.  Parking sucks, especially when you're wearing 6 inch stilettos and have to walk farther than you'd think to get in.  Atmosphere is good but a little crowded, some of the booths you're literally sitting back to back with strangers and the tables in the middle of the restaurant are pretty closely located as well.  Service was great, our server new all the details about the dishes and made recommendations as well.  Food was awesome!  Presentation was great, flavors were delicious and everything was perfectly cooked (I'd almost forgotten how a medium-rare steak ACTUALLY looked when done right!).  Moral of the story, I'll be coming back but I'll wear flats and try to get a corner table.

A group of us decided to meet up and hang out for St. Patrick's Day and Zipps was a convenient place for all of us to go.  It was surprisingly slow for the day but it worked out well for us because that meant lots of tables open for the 10 of us.  However the other usual perk of a slow restaurant, fast service, did not happen.  At all.  Most of our group had showed up early and gotten a big table and ordered already so when I showed up with one other friend there wasn't much the waitress needed to do.  She got our drink orders right away and came back a few minutes later to get our food orders.  I ordered a cup of chili and my friend ordered a Chicken Caesar salad, neither of which are items that take a particularly long time to put together.  However after about 20 minutes the waitress came back, not with the food, but to ask what I wanted on top of my chili again.  It had appeared as though she wrote it down when I ordered it the 20 minutes prior but apparently looks can be deceiving.  Then it took another 5 minutes for my chili to make it's grand entrance and another 5 minutes after THAT for my friend's salad to arrive.  Now again, this place was not busy at all!  It should not take 25 minutes to scoop some chili out of a pot where it sits all day and put it into a bowl and bring it to a table.  To make matters worse, not only was our server slow, but every time she came around and we asked for something she acted as though we were bothering her.  It honestly was kind of a buzz kill and our table ended up talking about how poor the service was rather than enjoying a fun St. Patrick's Day.

I like Safeway.  The prices are good and the stores are always clean and well laid out.  This one was no exception.  The checkout lines were appropriately staffed as well so I didn't have to wait once I was ready to go.  The clerk was friendly and made eye contact which is so rare anymore, of course I do always go to the self checkout when available so that could explain the lack of eye contact.....

I had a craving for sushi and a friend who wanted to try this place because a friend of his is a chef here.  It was the perfect combination!  Since it was a Friday night I suggested we get there early-ish to try and get a table quickly so we arrived around 5:30.  The place is pretty small so most of the tables were full but we managed to get seated right away.  My friend decided that he was going to order everything  so I knew dinner was definitely not going to be some Philly rolls and fried rice.  We started out with seaweed salad which I actually really liked.  The flavor was really good with the sesame seeds and some lemon.  Next was the sushi, we had the Alaskan roll, Spicy Tuna, Volcano roll and some Sea Bass nigiri.  The Alaskan and Spicy Tuna were good, the Volcano roll was awesome with it's spicy sauce nicely crusted on top and the Sea Bass was simple and delicious.  After that it was time for me to try Oysters for the first time.  Personally I wasn't a big fan but that has nothing to do with Hana and everything to do with just my personal preference.  I could tell the quality was good and they didn't taste gross, I just discovered that Oysters aren't my thing.  Now at this point we were pretty full but the chef my friend knew walked by and told him to get the Razor Clams and/or the Tako Karaage.  Neither of us knew what the second one was so we asked and discovered it was fried octopus head.  As soon as he told us that I knew that's what my friend was going to order.  I'll admit I was a little nervous because I was picturing something with eyeballs coming out onto the table.  Luckily when they brought it to the table it was cut into strips so it looked completely harmless.  We drizzled some lemon over it, took a deep breath and took a bite.  After about 2 seconds we looked at each other in amazement because it was DELICIOUS!!!  I'm talking so good my mouth is watering just remembering it right now.  Octopus has a tendency to get chewy but this had a texture like steak!  The flavor of it was amazing as well.  The lemon juice gave it just the right balance of citrus and whatever they marinated it in before frying it was perfect.  Definitely the highlight of the meal.  For desert we asked the waitress for her recommendation and she suggested the Hana An Mitsu which is aloe vera with fruit and red bean paste.  I wasn't quite sure about eating aloe vera as I associate it with putting it on my skin for a sun burn but we decided to continue our adventure of trying new things and get it.  It came out almost like a soup, there were big chunks of the aloe, a couple strawberries, some mandarin oranges and the chunky red bean paste all in a liquid of some kind.  Neither of us were really big fans, the aloe chunks were just too big and overpowered the rest of it.  Overall though the meal was one of the best I've had.  The quality and flavors of the food was excellent.

I love Kimpton Hotels.  I've been to several in different states and you receive the same world class service at each and every one.  As soon as I pulled up someone was there to open my door for me, told me where to go to check in and said they would give me my different options for parking or valet.  I had my dog with me and all of the staff came over to pet him or talk to him.  The girl at the front desk was very friendly and efficient, she got me checked in quickly and gave me a map with directions on how to get to my room and where everything was (the restaurant, fitness center, pools, parking, etc).  When I went to go back to my car the valets held the door open for me.  The parking and buildings were easy to find, there are building numbers on the gates outside so it's very simple finding your room and parking near to it.  The room itself was very nice as well.  The bathroom was good sized, there was a little area with a couple mirrors and a sink for getting ready, a mini fridge, flat screen tv, desk with a chair and my personal favorite part was the little patio.  There are these pretty french doors that open onto a decent sized patio with a couple chairs viewing the courtyard.  This was especially nice since I did have my dog with me so rather than having to walk him through the halls every time he needed to "do his business" I could just go out the back patio to the yard.  Room service was great as well, very prompt which surprised me at 7:30 on a Friday night but I probably only had to wait about 20 minutes.  The food was still hot and tasty when it got to me as well.  I was a little disappointed that the pizza oven wasn't working as I had wanted to try to the Margherita pizza but the cheeseburger with mozzarella was a yummy alternative.  The tiramisu was good as well, I liked how they served it in a little chocolate cup.  For breakfast I planned ahead and used the door card where you fill out your selections the night before and what time you want it served and then you can just wake up to breakfast rather than having to call and order.  I decided on the continental breakfast and chose the assortment of pastries, orange juice and coffee.  That ended up being a delicious flaky croissant, two muffins and a side of fruit.  The coffee was excellent quality also.  I didn't want to leave but alas my stay-cation had to come to an end.  Checking out was as easy as checking in.  Again everyone greeted me with a smile, commented on my dog and held doors open for me.  This is why I will be a loyal Kimpton member everywhere I go, it's hard to find places with consistently good services at locations around the country but Kimpton delivers that.

A friend took me here for our weekly lunch and it was a really cool dining experience.  It's very no fuss, it's set up like a fast food place, you look at the menu on the wall then order from the person behind the window.  Then they give you a buzzer that will go off when your food is ready while you go pick a place outside to eat.  The food is amazing!  You can tell how fresh everything is and it's cooked great too.  I can't wait to go back and get another great burger!

Went here last night to see a few different bands and was excited because it's always fun to go to a small venue like this.  The doors were supposed to open at 6:00, my friends and I got there at around 6:30 and there were still people waiting in line but it wasn't a big deal because since it was a Monster Energy Drink Tour they were handing out free Monsters.  The bouncers were friendly (and a lot of them were HOT!) as were the bartenders.  The bathroom situation isn't the greatest, only one stall in the girls bathroom so if you're going to use it, pee fast because there's going to be someone waiting behind you.  The whole atmosphere was very down to earth and laid back.  It was easy to have fun listening to great music.  After each band played there were tables set up where you could talk to them and get autographs which was awesome.  Most of the bands were super friendly and a lot more down to earth than you would expect.  I'll be back in March for the next concert I'm going to see here!

Not to quote Toby Keith or anything but...I love this bar!  There is no cover which is definately a good thing.  I got here around 8:45 or so on a Friday night and it was pretty dead, a few people here and there at the bar but pretty empty.  The bartender and patrons were friendly though so I didn't mind.  My friends showed up a little bit later and we got a table so that we could have a good view of the band once they started playing.  Once it got closer to 9:30-ish it started getting busier and before I knew it the place was full and I had to squeeze through couples to get to the bathroom!  The live bands were awesome and it was nice that the people watching were actually enjoying it and you could tell.  It's always more fun when everyone around you is having a good time!  The best (well, one of the best) part of the night was when I went to close out my tab and found out that it was only $3.50 each for my Vodka Red Bulls!  This fact was extra astounding to me seeing as how a few nights before I had literally spent twice that on the exact same drink at a bar in Scottsdale! (insert Scottsdale joke here...)

Decided to try something new today so stopping into Stax for some Sunday lunch sliders.  We were feeling a little adventurous so I ordered the Antelope slider which had a raspberry jalapeno jam and the Buffalo slider which is topped with Muenster cheese, an onion ring and peach BBQ sauce; my friend also got the Antelope slider and he got the Wagyu which has bleu cheese, asparagus tips and spicy ketchup.  We of course started out with the sweet potatoe fries which come with 5-6 different dipping sauces.  My favorite slider was the Antelope, the raspberry jam added a great flavor and the meat wasn't as different tasting as I was expecting.  The Buffalo was good but the BBQ sauce was a little overpowering and I didn't really taste the peach in it.  The Wagyu was good too but it's really just like a regular slider since it's still beef.  The sweet potato fries were delicious as well.  Perfectly cooked and the dipping sauces were awesome.  The waitress was really friendly and checking with us frequently to make sure we were doing okay and refilling water, definitely a plus in my book.  I'm going to try to make it back on a day when they're serving Kangaroo and/or Ostrich, can't wait to see how those taste!

My friend and I went here for lunch the other day and it was a very interesting experience.  She was on her lunch break from work so she was in her uniform, a pretty obvious indication that we're going to be in a hurry.  We sit at the bar since it's pretty slow and that way would be able to order right away with the bartender.  She came over and took our drink orders then wandered off to go get them.  While she was doing that a group of about four guys came in and sat a few seats down from us.  They must have been very interested because they caused the bartender to completely forget about us.   She dropped off our drinks and rushed over to take their order.  A few minutes later she must have gotten the crazy idea that maybe we wanted something to eat as well so she asked if we wanted some menus.  Um, yeah...thanks for noticing!  She quickly took our order, taking time out in between to find out if the group of guys needed another round.  I'm sorry that it took us all of two minutes to tell you what we wanted to eat, next time we'll try to speed that up for you.  Once we finished my friend asked to have her food boxed up to take home.  Now, some restaurants have such great customer service that they actually box it up for you, other offer you different sizes and check to see if you need containers for condiments as well.  Here at the Fox and Hound they throw the box in front of you as they're hurrying to flirt with the group of guys sitting near you.  Needless to say we were less than thrilled with our lunch hour experience.  But at least now we know that if we want to have good service next time we just need to make sure that there are absolutely no men in the restaurant to distract the server!

I was very impressed with Roka Akor when I came in last week.  I was with a large group and we had the private room reserved which was a little cramped as far as seating but it had a nice ambiance and the chairs were comfortable so it wasn't a big deal.  The service here is what really impressed me.  There were several different people coming in and out interacting with us (girls to fill our drinks, our server, a special server just for one of the items) and everyone was very friendly and professional.  The servers especially knew every little detail about the items on the menu and made recommendations, even offering substitutions on things for the two women at the table who were pregnant and wanted sushi that was okay for them to eat.  The food itself was delicious.  Everything was made with quality ingredients, you could taste how fresh it was.  I loved the Dynamite Scallop Roll and the Crispy Prawn Roll, I had the Soft Shell Crab Roll as well and it was good but the other two just blew it out of the water.  I really enjoyed the Crispy Fried Squid also.  The chili and lime on it takes it beyond your typical calamari.  Everyone else at the table loved their food as well, which was almost unfortunate because no one wanted to share!  Can't wait to come back and try some of the other menu items next time!

BFF and I decided to grab food last minute and Z'Tejas was close by so we stopped in to grub.  It was about 7:00 on a Friday night and the place was pretty busy.  Luckily we spotted a free table on the patio and were able to grab it right away.  Our server Alex came over almost immediately, gave us menus and took our drink orders (which was waters all around because she's pregnant and I didn't want to indulge in adult beverages in front of her haha!)  When he brought us our water we told him we wanted to order the Bottomless Chips and Salsa to start with because we were starving and needed something to eat just to be able to focus on ordering real food!  He let us know that the kitchen was slammed and that it would probably take 5-7 minutes for it.  I appreciated that because while we could see it's obviously busy, it's nice when the server sets accurate expectations.  Then he either exceeded our expectations or we have a really bad sense of time passing because it seemed like 2 minutes later he was back with the chips!  Moving on to the entrees...we both ordered the Hickory Burger, hers medium well with everything and sweet potato fries on the side and mine medium rare, no pickles or onions with regular fries.  To be honest I was nervous he wouldn't get it right because he didn't write it down, and while we were ordering the same burger, our orders were completely different.  To my surprise not only did the food come out correctly (My burger really was cooked to medium rare!!  That never happens!!) but it came out quickly too!  It was so delicious I would have waited for it though.  8 oz. burger, barbecue sauce, jalapeno mayonnaise, bacon and two types of cheese on a soft, fluffy bun....I'd describe it more but I fear the drool that's forming in my mouth will short circuit my keyboard so I'll leave it at that.  Oh!  One last thing back to our server as well, he made sure our water glasses were never empty!  One of my pet peeves is always running out of water and never being able to find your server but Alex was always checking with us even though he was literally running around helping all his tables.  Servers at other restaurants who make excuses for poor service by saying that they're "busy" should take a lesson from this guy who provided exceptional service in a packed restaurant.

At most buffets I at least leave feeling full, unfortunately I can't say the same for this one.  While there is a large quantity of different food options, the quality makes many of those options inedible.  There were a few different things that I was able to eat but for the most part I filled up on the desserts and not the actual food.

I randomly ended up here the other night with a friend to get our sushi fix (you sushi junkies know how serious those withdrawals are).  I ordered the Sunkissed Roll and it was pretty good.  I really like that the Edamame is free with your food instead of being $2 or some other measly charge that's more of an annoyance than anything just because you have to physically order it.  So that was a plus.  Service was very good also.  Our waitress was constantly checking with us to make sure our water was filled and see if we needed anything else.

I had a customer come in and her nails were banging so I told her I had to know where she had gone so that I could try to get my swag on her level.  To my delight she told me the place was just a few minutes away on Ray and Rural!  Now I'm not the type of girl who goes to the nail salon every week for mani-pedi's but a friend was doing a music video shoot and I was going to be in it so I figured I could expense it at that point...I'm sending him the bill.  Walked in on Friday at around 1:00 and the lobby was pretty full so I debated leaving because I was on my lunch break and while I can get away with a lot I knew that it would probably be frowned upon if I took a 2 hour lunch.  Luckily everyone was helped within minutes of my arrival and they were able to get me right in.  The girl who was in charge of my nail transformation was Natalie and she was awesome.  Suuuuper sweet, call me a sucker for pet names but she kept calling me "honey" and I wasn't mad at it.  She actually made conversation too which was nice 'cause I'm not all about that awkward silence you get with most nail experiences.  She did a great job too, my french tip toes are on point and my nails are able to be seen in public again.  I'm going to have to step my game up at work because coming here makes me WANT to be one of those girls who's in the salon every week.

I'd been craving sushi for what felt like years so when a friend and I decided to grab dinner I already knew what I wanted.  We typically go to Geisha or Ra but felt like something different so we picked Pearl.  We got there around 7:00 and were able to get seated right away.  We started with the Sweet Chili Sambal Edamame which was DELICIOUS!!  It's going to be tough to eat just plain old regular Edamame from this point forward.  Then for our actual sushi we ordered the Crab Daddy, the Fake and Bake and the Spicy Salmon roll.  Two of the rolls came out pretty quickly but then it took about 5-10 minutes for the third to get to us.  The Fake and Bake was definitely the winner of the three, the flavors just blended very well together and the sauces on it were great.  The Spicy Salmon was good, but as it's a pretty standard, not too exciting roll there isn't much to say about that.  I personally wouldn't order the Crab Daddy again because I felt like the asparagus in it was too tough for the delicate sushi around it, my friend liked it though so I would just call that a personal preference.  One thing that I definitely loved was that my glass of water never got below half full because our server/bartender (who we later found out was actually the owner!) always made sure to fill it up once it started getting low.  I will definitely be adding Pearl to my frequented sushi locations from this point forward.

Some friends and I decided to meet up for Happy Hour and La Bocca won our pick for new place to try out.  I was happy that there was parking basically right behind it so that I didn't have to walk too far from my car (you know me and my stilettos!)  The girls at the host station were friendly and greeted me right away, my friend already had a table though so I was able to walk right in.  Our server came over very quickly to take our drink order and tell us about happy hour.  Unfortunately for us the things we wanted (Sangria and the Orange Blossom Martini) were not included in the special.  We decided to get them anyway and were glad we did as they were both delicious.  The third member of our group showed up at that point and ordered herself a sangria as well.  Both of them ordered salads (caesar for her and caprese for him) but I wanted something with a bit more sustenance so I asked the server for his recommendation.  He said his favorite item was the Bocca Trio pizza which had tomatoes, pepperoni, salami, sausage and olives.  It sounded good and I figured my friends would need something more than leaves and seeds to tide them over so they could share mine.  The caprese salad should have been called a caprese plate because what came out was not a salad.  It was good, but it was about 4 basil leaves and then some mozzarella and tomato.  I would consider that more of an appetizer than an entree salad so he definitely shared my pizza.  The caesar salad was what you would expect and she seemed to enjoy it.  My Bocca Trio pizza was very good which was bad because my friends didn't take as much to share as I'd hoped and I was left with most of it when we finished.  I will definitely be coming back to La Bocca again and I can't wait to try some of their other offerings.

Finally got my best friend to go to the gym with me but her pre-workout meal was a gas station donut so needless to say we needed sustenance pronto once we were done. In the spirit of health we decided some salads from Paradise Bakery would probably be among our best options for lunch.  There really wasn't a line when we arrived at noon on a Wednesday, maybe 1-2 people so we were helped right away. My friend decided on the Sesame Chicken and she's quite the picky eater so she had several changes she made to the salad but the person helping didn't give her a hard time about it. I ordered for myself the half size Fuji Apple Chicken salad.  Once we got to the cashier I noticed they had smoothies that looked pretty good from the descriptions. Since I've been busting my butt lately to lose weight I've been very conscious of calories so I asked if they knew how many were in the smoothies. Rather than just guessing the girl actually went and found the nutrition facts for me so I could see everything. I was so impressed that she went out of her way to do that when most people would have guessed or not even tried to figure it out. Kudos to her, wish I'd caught her name!  The salad and smoothie were AMAZING!! If I wasn't in a public place I probably would have licked the bowl clean. The sweet and savory flavor combination in the salad was so different and delicious. The super fruit smoothie was nice and refreshing without being too sweet and you could taste a hint of the yogurt which I personally like.  Overall I was very happy with not only the good but the service at this location.

One of the best meals I've had in a while.  The atmosphere is really cool, they have an open kitchen and you can sit right at the counter around it and watch them make your food.  You can imagine that with that kind of pressure they're gonna be working harder to make sure it's good!  They didn't disappoint.  I ordered the Smoked Truffle-Infused Filet Mignon and was so happy I did!  It was actually cooked correctly (medium rare) and came with a delicious red wine sauce that complemented it perfectly.  For dessert I couldn't decide between two of them so I ordered both!  Total splurge but it was worth it.  I got the cheesecake and the Gateau Marjolaine.  The cheesecake was honestly one of, if not the best cheescakes I've ever had.  The flavor and texture were exquisite and it was simply topped with some sliced almonds.  The Gateau Marjolaine was good, but nothing compared to that cheesecake.  I was impressed with the service as well.  I had a dedicated server who took my orders and checked on me but that didn't stop the other servers and bussers from checking on me as well which I love.  If I was finished with something then whoever noticed first took care of it and cleared it for me.  Same with refilling my water so it was just a great experience from start to finish in all aspects.

About 90% of the time I come to this Walmart I leave angry.  And I'm not talking like "Oh that was kind of annoying but things happen" angry but more along the lines of "I literally hate this place and would never come here if I didn't have to."  It seems like no matter what day of the week or time of day I come here there are RIDICULOUS lines and too few registers open.  It's to the point where you have to walk up the aisles just to get past the columns of people stacked up in line because they go that far back.  And the lines don't move quickly either.  I don't know how they find that many people who can move as slowly as the checkers here do.  It seriously escapes me.  And on top of all that, the parking situation is essentially Minesweeper with shopping carts.  You'll start to pull into a space and there will be a cluster of shopping carts so you're left with the decision....Do I try to navigate around the carts to try to get the space or try and find another spot even farther away?  Neither are very desirable options.  Seriously how hard is it to hire someone to gather the carts?  I wouldn't think there would be a great amount of training required for that position.....  The only reason I'm giving this location two stars instead of one is because they are open 24 hours (which is pretty much the only reason I come here, when one of my regular grocery stores is closed) and because they have this one really nice elderly gentleman checker who was actually friendly for a change (imagine that, a Walmart checker with a personality!) and he put my bags in my cart for me without even asking.  I wish I remembered his name but I've only seen him the one time.  It's a shame they don't have more employees like him.

I think most women (and some men) know how hard it is to find a stylist that you can actually trust to not eff up your hair and I'm happy to say I have found mine!  Brittany Lehman is a Saint with Scissors (sorry I had to :P).  Generally my request to her when I go in is to "Make my hair hot" and she is always up to the task.  I'm always complimented after I've had my Brittany fix.  I'll follow that girl wherever she goes!

Oh Junkie, what can I say about a place that once hosted midget wrestling besides...I love you!  This is one of my favorite places just because it's not quite as snobby as Scottsdale locales can be.  There's three different bars which comes in handy when it gets busy, which it does often, and a few places with enough room to get your groove on if you feel so inclined.  Not to mention that they have a wheel you can spin with such options as "Body Shots" (I may or may not have had the wheel land on that one before...) or "Kiss a stranger".

Looooved this hike!  Preggo friend wanted to go for a hike but seeing as she's extra delicate right now we didn't want to have to deliver her baby on Camelback so we decided to find something a bit easier.  This one seemed to be a good option plus it was closer to us than some other ones.  First of all the parking situation is MUCH better than Camelback.  Even though the lot at the direct base of the trail was full, you can park within about 1/4 mile of it rather than 2 miles down the road.  The hike itself looked to not be too high so perfect for what we were looking for.  Once we got started it was a bit tougher than we originally thought just due to the loose, rocky trail and steep incline but still definitely doable.  The view at the top is awesome because you get a 360 of the whole valley and can even see downtown Phoenix in the distance.  We made it up and back down in probably about an hour and that was at a leisurely pace.  I would say this is the perfect trail for people who want a hike that's semi-difficult but not something you dread doing.  We're already planning on doing it again next week!

My husband and I ate here a couple nights ago, our first night in Maricopa. A friend of his was taking us out and recommended Teakwoods as they had great food. One of the first things you'll notice when you walk in is the peanut shells all over the floor. Don't be alarmed, there isn't an army of peanut throwing little kids running around, they put buckets of peanuts on all the tables and when you're done you just throw the shells on the floor (not at other people...)  The service I would say was average. We were seated right away and the waitress came to our table pretty quickly to get our drink orders but we didn't see her again for a while. It didn't seem that busy to me but it sure seemed like it from how infrequently our waitress stopped by. I guess my advice for that would be don't come here when you are absolutlely starving because it will be a while before you see your food.  The food on the other hand was very good. I ordered the Chuck Burger which is basically a bacon cheeseburger. I was very happy that you get to pick your side dish and there was quite a large selection. I was also impressed that they cook your burger to order instead of just burning them all the same. The burger was very good and large, I had to bring some of it home with me because I couldn't finish the whole thing in one sitting.  So if you're looking for a place with good food, peanut shells on the ground and slow service, Teakwoods is the place for you!

If you live in Maricopa then you know how limited your selection of restaurants is so it's really nice when you find a good one.  My mother in law and grandmother in law wanted to go out to breakfast and we decided to make them drive here from Mesa so that we didn't have to.  We decided to go to Sunrise Cafe so that we wouldn't have to drive 20 miles somewhere else.  Now, when people say this place is small they really mean it.  This place is TINY!  When we got there one of the servers told us to sign in by the cash register and then go sit outside and they would call us when something opened up.  It was probably under 10 minutes until we were seated so it wasn't too long of a wait.  They have a huge menu which is nice so that you have more options than the standard offerings.  The food was very good and the servings were gigantic.  The server we had was very friendly and attentive, always making sure we had whatever we needed.  The prices on the menu seemed cheap but the total for all four of us ended up being $52 before tip which is a bit expensive for breakfast if you ask me.  But the food was good and the service was friendly so I will be returning in the future, I'll just be timing it around payday!

CiCi's was one of the places I was really excited to go to once I moved to AZ from WA because they always played commercials for them but there aren't actually any restaurants in Washington!  It was smaller than I expected it to be but not having any other comparison I'm not counting that as a bad thing.  The hostess who greeted us was very friendly and made sure we knew what our options were for dining and she gave us her name in case we had any questions.  Pretty good service for a buffet if you ask me.   Being as I had never been to a CiCi's before and that I was really hungry when I went, I tried pretty much everything they had to offer.  I had a couple different types of pizza, both of which were very good I thought.  They had just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  The amount of toppings kind of depended on which piece you picked, some had a lot, some had just one or two toppings on the entire piece.  The salad was good as well, I had the pre-made Italian style one.  I liked it, I would have liked to have had croutons either already in the salad or the option to add them but it's not a deal breaker so I got over it.  Moving on to my favorite part...dessert!  I had one of each of the three desserts they had out and I enjoyed all of them.  The brownies were nice and soft and had a good flavor.  The apple crumb pizza thing tasted JUST like apple pie but in a less messy, smaller serving size.  The sticky buns were my favorite though.  They were very light and fluffy and had just the right amount of frosting, not too much that you had a sugar overload but not so little that you feel like you're eating a biscuit.  I left feeling very satisfied with myself for getting good food for such a cheap price and I will definately be returning in the future!

A friend and I were meeting up for lunch and the original plan was to go to a different Thai place we'd been to before.  Unfortunately that place didn't open until 5:00 and we met up at 3:00...fail.  Luckily I used my handy-dandy Yelp app to find other Thai places within a nearby radius and Thai E-San was the closest one and had a decent rating.  It's definitely a pretty nondescript building but I figured that a lot of the time those are the hidden gems that most people don't give a chance to.  We walked in and someone was already waiting with menus (I'm assuming he saw us pull up through the windows) and took us to a table right away.  There was only one other group in the restaurant but it was a little late for normal lunch and early for dinner so I wasn't surprised.  It worked out nicely for us though as our waitress was able to check on us frequently and made sure our drinks were always full and we had everything we needed.  The menu is HUUUUGE!!  There are at least 70+ items to choose from so it's a little overwhelming at first and if you're indecisive like me it's quite the task picking just one thing!  I ended up going with the Spicy Fried Rice with Basil with Beef as the meat.  I also ordered the Thai Egg Rolls.  My friend got something with Silver Noodles, I can't remember what it was listed as on the menu.  The egg rolls came out nice and hot and crispy, flavor was good and I love that they have the sweet and sour sauce in bottles on the table so you can apply it as you like.  The main dishes came out not to long after and portions were very generous.  I ate more than I probably should have because it was so good and it looked like I'd barely touched my plate.  Even my friend who is 6'8" couldn't finish his plate.  We both concluded that we were happy the other Thai place was closed as this one had a bigger selection and bigger portions so it seems like it was meant to be!

I finally got fed up enough with dealing with the tweakers and other various psychos that frequent Walmart so I decided to drive a little farther than normal and check out Fresh & Easy.  It's very bright and clean and everything is laid out nicely.  Very easy to find everything and I like that they don't have lots of options for different brands of items (why are there 27 thousand different companies who make ketchup anyway???)  They focus on quality rather than quantity and I for one appreciate that.  Not to mention that their prices are awesome too!  Who would have thought quality and affordable could work together?  I will definitely plan a little extra travel time in order to shop here from now on.

Some friends and I were in the area for sushi and decided we wanted to happy hour it up so we made our way over to Sandbar.  Once we were seated with our menus we were wishing we had started there rather than finishing because it was Taco Tuesday and they had $2 tacos!!!  That would have been way better than the average-at-best sushi we had eaten just before....so in order to drown our sorrows we got straight to the business of discounted drinks!  I can't recall all the drink specials but I know wells were $4 and I think drafts were $3?  Our waitress was awesome too, she stopped by pretty frequently to see how we were doing and get us whatever we needed, plus she was super friendly and was joking around with us.  I wish I would have gotten her name!  Definitely a happy hour I will be frequenting again in the future!

Ummmmm how have I never been to this place before???  When I heard there was a place that sold shoes for $10 a couple thoughts came to me.  First of all was, "I need to be there RIGHT NOW!" and the second was, "This is going to be dangerous....."  Disregarding the cautious voice in my head I decided to stop by anyway.  I told myself I was only going to buy one pair of shoes, some wedges, and that would be it.  Walking in felt like a flashback to being 6 years old and walking into a candy store.  There were so many colors and choices and sparkly things and I just wanted to hug somebody!  I knew it was going to be a challenge to complete my mission of leaving with just one pair of shoes but I was determined to stick to it.  By sheer determination I accomplished that goal and found a cute pair of black and gold wedges that were just what I was looking for.  I made my purchase and waved a tearful goodbye to the rest of the shoes that I wanted but forced myself to hold off on, promising that I would return soon for the rest of them.  And return I will...

I was soooo happy to find out that there was a Maurice's kind of close to where I moved to. The store is a little bigger than the other one I used to go to and they had a good selection of clothes.  There was only one girl working but she was very attentive to everyone and made sure we were all being taken care of. When she noticed my arms were getting full she took all of my stuff and started a dressing room for me with my name on it so it was saved for when I was ready.  While I was changing she came back multiple times to see if I needed different sizes in anything and she was very quick about getting them and bringing them back.  Another thing I really liked was that she made sure to see if I had a punch card so that I got the punches for my purchase.

Let me just start off by saying that I've only been in Arizona for 3 days and I've already been to this Sonic twice, so I guess that means I'm a fan.  I had never been to a Sonic before because there wasn't one in the area I lived in Washington, but my husband talked about them ALL THE TIME!  So once we moved down to Maricopa it was pretty much a given that we would be going pretty soon after we got here.  The first thing he noticed was that it isn't a full car hop like the ones he had been to before.  You go through the standard drive thru lane and give your order to the giant speakerbox but then afterwards you stop and wait and someone brings out your food and takes your payment then.  He wasn't too fond of that but since I didn't have a prior knowledge of how it was "supposed" to be done, I thought it was pretty cool.  The food was very good for a fast food place.  The first time I got the popcorn chicken meal with tator tots and a cherry-limeade slushie.  All of that was great and the slushie helped my sore throat feel a lot better as well.  The second time I got the extra long coney chili dog with chili cheese tator tots and a strawberry-limeade slushie (I'm not too adventurous with my drink selection yet).  And let me just warn you, when they say "extra long" what they really mean is this hot dog is longer than your forearm.  Needless to say I was not able to finish even half of that monster.  The tots were awesome with chili and cheese and I discovered that I liked the cherry-limeade over the strawberry, but that's all just personal preference.  The service was good, everyone we talked to was friendly and chipper.  The second guy who came out to our car apologized for the wait even though I didn't notice one.  I guess it took 3 minutes instead of 2 to get our food or something.  I liked that they go through all of the food to make sure that everything you ordered is there and made correctly before they have you pay for it.  Most fast food places I have to sit there and go through the bag before I leave to make sure they didn't screw something up or give me someone else's food.  Sonic is definately a place I will be going to again if I'm in the mood for some good fast food.

So as I'm laying on the couch with the heater, several layers of sweaters, a blanket and an 80 lb Lab on me I realized that I was about 99% sure I had a fever.  Due to this I really didn't want to have to be moving around making dinner so I went to Grub Hub to find somebody who would deliver sustenance to my miserable self.  I didn't really have a particular type of cuisine in mind so I was simply looking for places that didn't have a delivery minimum as I was just ordering for myself and didn't want to be forced to order more than I wanted just to be able to get delivery.  Rosati's fit the bill and had a Calzone on the menu that looked good.  It starts as just a plain cheese Calzone but there's a large selection of toppings you can pick from and add to it.  I went with the Old Faithful of pepperoni and submitted my order.  It estimated that the delivery would take about 50 minutes so I got to work on occupying myself with the Christmas re-runs that were still on.  To my delight my calzone arrived about 10 minutes earlier than estimated, a rarity with delivery food.  Once I opened the box I found a monster of a calzone that could probably feed three grown men.  That worked out well though because I figured I'd probably be sick for a while and that meant leftovers!  As soon as I cut into the beast I knew it was going to be good just from the cheese that started oozing out of it.  The flavors lived up to this expectation.  The pepperoni was flavorful, the cheese was perfectly melted, the crust was flaky and perfectly cooked and just the right amount of sauce inside, I didn't even need the extra sauce that came with it.  The only thing that wasn't as amazing as I'd been hoping was the leftovers.  They just didn't come anywhere close to as good as the original had been but then again most food doesn't.  I can't wait to order this Calzone again and I won't even need to be sick to do so next time!

A coworker of mine had eaten here and was raving about it so I was really excited to try it.  When I got the address I was a little worried because this place is NOT fancy.  I walked inside and was greeted right away and seated promptly which is always a plus in my book.  There was a singer covering Elvis songs which could have been nice except that he would randomly serenade tables (something I did not want to happen to mine) and it was too loud so it was a bit distracting.  The menu had a decent selection and I liked that a lot of the dishes gave you different options for the kind of sauce you could get on it.  One of the things my coworker had mentioned was the bruschetta so we made sure to order that to start out.  It was probably the best bruschetta I've had.  The bread was perfectly cripsy and had a great garlic flavor, the tomatoes were fresh and the herbs were the perfect balance.  The main course was baked spaghetti with meat sauce for me and baked lasagna with sausage for my friend.  The spaghetti was good, I would order it again but it wasn't mind blowing.  My friend loved his lasagna, his plate was cleared before I was half done.  The service was good, she was friendly and nice, just not overly so.  Our water was constantly filled though and she frequently checked on us to see if we needed anything else.  I will definately be returning soon, but I will be checking to make sure it's not on a night with a live singer.....

I needed some new headphones and I know that I have a really good accessory discount at AT&T (not to mention I was getting anxiety from all the Christmas shoppers clogging up the walkways) so I decided to stop in and see what they had.  I wasn't greeted when I walked in and it probably took about 3 minutes before someone checked on me to see if I needed help.  I know I look young, but I don't look like some punk 15 year old who isn't going to buy anything.  I asked about the different kinds of headphones they had and the girl went to go look in a cabinet.  I picked the one I wanted and she took it to the counter to ring it up.  I told her I have an accessory discount so she pulled up my account and said she had to look up the percentage.  I wouldn't think that would take too long but it was taking so long my friend at one point jokingly asked if I was signing a new contract.  When I was finally paid up the girl did walk around the counter to hand me my bag but I don't think she smiled once while she was helping me and she seemed to be somewhere between bored and un-caring.  I will be not be returning to this location if I can avoid it.

I've put off going to the dentist for a couple years because I had a bad experience at the last one I went to but I decided I had to woman up and make an appointment for a checkup and cleaning.  Of course I used Yelp to look for places because with something like this I needed to know that they had a good reputation.  Downtown Phoenix Dental not only had a really good rating but there were more reviews for them than the other options listed.  I called to make an appointment and Caleb was very friendly and helpful in getting me set up.  They have you do all your new patient paperwork online ahead of time so you won't have to do it when you get there.  The days I had originally requested weren't available so I made one for the following week but the next day he actually emailed me and let me know that there had been an opening and I actually could get in the day I had asked for!  When I showed up for my appointment Caleb already knew my name (I guess I was the only appointment for that time slot) and didn't really need much from me.  I didn't have to wait long, someone came and took my X-Rays and then the hygienist called me over to look at them and get started on the cleaning.  Her name was Audra and she was very nice and gentle.  Cleanings are never fun, I don't know about you but the scraping feeling is worse than if it was actually painful, but she did everything quickly so it wasn't too bad.  Not to mention my teeth look great!  Once she was done the dentist himself came over to talk to me for a little bit and look at everything as well.  To my surprise everything was good, (I figured I'd have bad teeth karma since I hadn't been to a dentist in so long) and they just scheduled me for another cleaning in 6 months!  No unnecessary procedures suggested or issues that they needed to see me for.  I actually liked them so much that I requested to come back just to speak with the Orthodontist when she comes in.  I'm actually looking forward to coming back rather than dreading it so I'm very happy Yelp steered me in the right direction yet again!

After a wild night out you'll probably find yourself hungover and lazy the next morning looking for a good place to go for breakfast/brunch.  Well look no further because I have the solution for your problem.  RnR has now claimed a special spot in my heart as the go to place for my hangover breakfast cravings.  Went here Saturday morning (11:00-ish) and it was pretty crowded with a lot of the people you probably saw the night before.  There was a DJ playing great music to put you in a good mood and you see Mimosas and Bloody Mary's on almost every table.  They have a bottomless option for those drinks so for $15 you can get as many as you want, they just keep coming around and filling them up again.  Dangerous but delicious!  The food is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  I was trying to be kind of good so I ordered the protein pancakes and you never really know how that's going to turn out but let me tell you, these were some of the best pancakes of any kind I've ever had!  They have blueberries in them, granola on top and come with a good amount of apple butter to spread.  They bring syrup along with them but honestly you don't even need it because they're so good.  My friend ordered the Bleu Cheese Burger which was delicious as well.  The flavors blended really well together, it was cooked perfectly and you could tell the meat was high quality.  All this being said, I think it's pretty clear that you'll know where to find me in the early-ish hours of the weekend.

Went here for a date last week and I really liked it!  The hostess greeted us right away and took us to our table.  I don't know if she could tell we were on a date or what but she gave us a great corner booth that was a little secluded which was nice.  The waitress came out right away and had a thick Italian accent (always a really good sign when you're at an Italian restaurant!).  She made recommendations and knew how the food was cooked when asked.  I decided to go with the Chicken Parmesan (I know it's not that creative but I love it!) and my date got the Chicken Marsala.  Both were great.  Our plates were cleared when we left.  Before the meal you get salad and crispy garlic bread both of which were also yummy.  Also my water glass never got empty which, to me, is the true test of how good a restaurant's service is.  I'll definitely be returning!

My reasoning for checking out Rocket Burger is kind of weird but I'm glad it got me through the door.  One of my friends from Ohio always talks about Faygo soda and when I saw that in one of the pictures for Rocket Burger I knew I had to go for that and then after seeing all the great reviews I was excited about the food too.  Had a little trouble trying to find it at first so for everyone trying to find it for the first time, it's on the South West corner of Cactus and 35th Ave.  You probably won't see it from the street but there's a Church's Chicken right in front of it so just pull into that parking lot and Rocket Burger is right behind it.  I got the Single Bacon Cheeseburger with fries and a Faygo soda (of course!).  The guy at the counter was nice and polite but not overly friendly.  The food came out very quickly, probably under 5 minutes and it was nice and hot.  The burger was good, they really stack it with the toppings too and you can tell they're quality.  No soggy veggies and limp bacon here.  I loved the fries too!  They're shoestring and they're coated with some kind of seasoning salt that gives them a great flavor.  So glad that my quest for soda helped me discover a great burger place too!

I've driven past this place so many times and have always wanted to try it so when I had the day off and some extra time the other day I decided it was finally time!  The layout was easy, as soon as you walk in the frozen yogurt selections are all on your left hand side with labels so you can decide what kind of concoctions you want to start with, they have a good number of choices too.  I decided on the cheesecake and the raspberry sorbet (the sorbet was apparently vegan which doesn't make a difference to me but I still thought it was cool they had that option).  The cheesecake flavor I didn't like too much but the raspberry was really good.  At the end of the line they have your toppings station where there are different kinds of fresh fruit, syrups, candy, crushed cookies, sprinkles, nuts, almost anything you could think of to top your froyo and then some.  I tried not to let my inner 6 year old run free and limited the amount of candy I allowed myself to scoop on and stuck with mainly fruits.  Once my masterpiece was achieved I hoisted it onto the scale and said a silent prayer it would be under $10.  To my delight it was only $4 something.  The lady said they have a rewards program too so once you earn a certain number of points you get something free.  Can't beat that!

I had been putting off getting my hair done after my last experience at a salon but it got to a point where it was necessary.  I called and made an appointment for a cut and color.  The girl who answered the phone was friendly so it gave me hope that this time would be a better experience.  I had never been to San Tan Village before so it took me a little while to find the salon but after a while I finally spotted it.  I was greeted when I walked in and found out at the girl at the counter was my stylist, Bethenny.  She walked around the counter and shook my hand which was a nice gesture that I hadn't had at other salons prior to this.  The color was the easy part of this process as I had the "formula" for it from my old stylist so I wasn't worried about that at all.  I was however nervous about the cut.  I'm trying to grow my hair out but my ends were pretty dry and I wanted to change it up a little.  I think most women out there can sympathize with how nerve racking it is to go to a new stylist, tell them you only want "a trim" and hope that their version is the as yours and it doesn't take your shoulder length hair to the bottom of your ears.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results once everything was finished, the color looked great, even throughout and very shiny.  I must have had some good karma saved up too because the cut turned out great!  She really did just trim it and put in some fun layers to freshen it up.  I will definately be returning in the future!

My windshield has had a few chips for a while (one of the joys of living in AZ) but they weren't in my line of vision so I just left them.  Then about a week ago I finally got one that turned into a big crack that basically went across the entire bottom of my windshield.  I decided I probably shouldn't just let it sit there so I made an appointment with Safelite.  When I arrived I was a little worried at first that I was at the wrong place because while it said "Safelite" on the front it looked like an office building.  I walked in and was greeted right away and the receptionist even knew my name since apparently I was the only one scheduled at that time.  She had me take a seat while she let someone know I was there.  The technician came out and explained the process and told me it would be about an hour to an hour and a half.  To my surprise about 35 minutes later someone let me know it was done, I just had to wait 25 more minutes for the adhesive to set.  All in all it was an easy, smooth experience and everyone I dealt with was friendly and had good customer service.  I'll definitely be recommending everyone to come here if they need anything done.

I don't typically review grocery stores but this particular location won we over when I found their bulk section!  I had been looking everywhere (including other Fry's locations) for pearl barley that I needed for a recipe but I couldn't find it anywhere so I gave up.  I wandered into this Fry's one day and noticed their bulk section which, amazingly, had pearl barley!  I know it's kind of sad that something this small gets me excited but, what can I say, I'm easily impressed.  Besides the joys that are the bulk section this store has a nicer atmosphere than the other Fry's stores I've been too and seems to have a slightly larger selection as well.  This location has definitely become my new main grocery store.

I have to be in the right mood to come to Smashboxx but when I am it's a lot of fun.  It's definitely more of a club scene than anything else, this is where I come when "I just want to dance!"  It's really crowded and really loud but hey, sometimes that what you want when you're raging!  Just make sure that you put on some extra deodorant before you go becuase I guarantee you will be sweating due to the heat and the crazy dancing you will be influenced to do.  Your friends will appreciate it...

As soon as I walked in the receptionist greeted me with a smile and got me all signed in.  The office itself is very nicely decorated and there's lots of comofortable chairs and a couch so waiting wasn't too big of a deal.  I did have to wait a little bit longer than some of the other people waiting but I was a new patient so I had more paperwork to take care of and they were returning patients.  The nurse brought me back and took all my information down.  She was very friendly which is wonderful when you're telling a stranger your sensitive personal information.  The exam room was decorated very well also so that along with the friendliness of the nurse made me feel really comfortable.  The doctor that I had was Janice Reynolds and she was also very friendly.  She asked a few more questions about my health history than the nurse did it was still relaxing and I didn't feel uncomfortable about anything.  The exam itself was very quick and nothing out of the ordinary.  Before she left Janice let me know that they will call me with the results whether they're good or bad which I like because it's nice to know what's going on with your body.

Now that I've finally visited Plato's Closet I'm kicking myself for not going sooner.  I can't believe how amazing the prices are!  The selection is huge and there are a lot of big name designer items at prices so reasonable that an average Jill like myself can actually afford them.  The staff is really friendly and helpful.  A shirt that my friend was buying had a small snag so they dropped the price even more.  They also have a loyalty program where you get a stamp for every $10 you spend and once the card is full you get a percentage off your entire purchase!

The Herb Box is now officially my favorite place for brunch/lunch.  The service is great, everyone from the hostess to the waiter to the busser who filled my water was friendly and helpful.  The food is fresh and delicious.  I had the Market Street BLT which has egg, prosciutto, arugala, tomato and ricotta on brioche.  It was amazing!  My friend ordered the Cinnamon Buckwheat pancakes with honey butter and they were really good too.  Can't wait to come back and try something else!

Oh Hefe, my home away from home...I made a recent discovery of the amazuzing tacos here the other day and I'm kicking myself for not trying them sooner with as much as I'm here!  If you don't do anything else here, TRY THE TACOS!!!!  I had the Carne Asada and the Pork tacos and they were freaking delicious!  My friend ordered the chips and salsa which I know isn't really anything super special but the pico de gallo was very good as well, just in case you were wondering.  If you're going to come on a weekend night it does get pretty crowded so I wouldn't recommend coming if you're claustrophobic but it's a fun atmosphere where you can meet a lot of interesting people and get some good drinks and tacos!

My birthday is coming up in a few days so I decided to treat myself a little bit and get a brazilian wax.  I'd been putting it off because it's not exactly a procedure that is comfortable or relaxing and it's always awkward going to a new person to get it done.  I finally buckled down and made the appointment though because I'd been wanting it for a while.  It took me a little while to find a place to park so I was about 10 minutes late to my appointment and I was worried they would tell me I had to reschedule but surprisingly they still got me in right away.  Anita was the aesthetician who helped me and she was super down to earth and friendly and made me feel comfortable right away.  She was very informative about everything she was doing so there was never that moment of, "Whoa!  What's going on?!"  I liked that she was talkative too so there wasn't an awkward silence throughtout.  One of the most amazing things about the experience though was that it wasn't as painful as the ones I used to get!  She doesn't use hard wax at all so it was a lot less uncomfortable.  Not to mention she was very fast so I was in and out pretty quickly (definately a good thing with a procedure like this, let me tell you).  And because I had such a great experience with this procedure, I'm looking forward to going back and getting other services done too.  To me that says a lot about a business and from what I've seen they'll live up to my expectations!

Best place for day drinking!  I've spent way too many days people watching and drinking myself into a stupor here but it's so much fun that I don't even mind!  There's definitely a large showing of the typical Scottsdale crowd but mixed in there are a few non converts wandering around.  Besides it's fun to watch the juice head gorillas walking around trying not to pass out from flexing so hard!  Besides people watching though the drinks are good, average priced for the area and the food I've tried is actually good.  The bartenders are nice to look at too (male and female).  Most likely you'll see me there on Saturday nights or Sunday afternoons having myself a grand old time!

I can't believe I hadn't been here before yesterday!  Talk about a hidden gem!  I was taking a friend around to cross stuff off her "List of Stuff to do Before the World Ends" and smoking a hookah happened to be on it.  Therefore I googled places nearby us and Oasis popped up.  As soon as we got there the guy at the door welcomed us in with a smile and opened the door for us and once inside the waitress/bartender helped us pick a table and took our drink orders.  We decided to get the peach hookah and an order of the Hummus and Pita Deluxe with beef.  The food was delicious and the hookah was great!  The staff was awesome the entire night as well.  Everyone kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and they would just stop and chat with us as well.  One guy was even helping my friend try to make smoke circles!  I definitely love that they're open until 4 am on Fridays and Saturdays too because it's always nice to have somewhere to wind down after all the bars close!

I had seen the menu for this place laying around at work and I had assumed that it wouldn't be very good because $2.95 for a hamburger?  Those are fast food prices!  They can't be good quality for that!  My co-workers assured me I was wrong but I took my time checking the place out.  That finally changed today when I decided I was bored of every other place I normally go to for lunch and a burger sounded good.  I walked in and was greeted right away (eye contact, smile, everything!).  The girl who helped me was friendly and patient as I took my time ordering since I hadn't been there before.  I ordered the Double Char with cheese and a side of fries to go.  As I was waiting I was happy to see some of the employees going around and wiping counters, sweeping the floors, just doing general cleaning which made me happy because a clean place that serves food is a great place!  My buzzer letting me know my food was ready went off pretty quickly but not so fast that I felt like they just grabbed my burger out from under a heat lamp.  The man who gave me my food (possibly the manager) made sure to relay my order back to me to make sure it was correct and offered packets of ketchup for my fries.  He made eye contact the whole time and was also very friendly.  Once I had my bag of goods I couldn't resist reaching in for a fry (or possibly two....) right away.  They were hot, fresh and perfectly cooked!  A nice crunch on the outside but still soft on the outside and the perfect amount of salt.  Once I bit into my burger I was equally impressed.  The meat was cooked about medium so nice and juicy, the cheese was oozing off the sides and the veggies were fresh and perfectly portioned to the burger.  I'm only a little ashamed to admit that I actually finished the whole thing (which is why my next stop after finishing this review is going to be the gym...) because it was so delicious.  I will definitely be making The Habit one of my habits!  Hehe I made a pun!

Dropped in with a friend on a Friday night and it was D-E-A-D.....that's never a good sign but we figured oh well, we're here so might as well stay.  We grab a table and a waitress comes over pretty quickly to get our order.  My friend was hungry so we asked about food but she informed us that the kitchen closed at midnight, it was about 12:08.  That was annoying because I just feel like if your establishment is open until 2:00 you should have the WHOLE thing open until 2:00am.  So once that was discovered we decided we were just gonna finish our drinks and look for somewhere that did serve food.  Unfortunately at this point our waitress had vanished.  We were looking around the whole bar (which again, was 90% empty) and couldn't find her anywhere.  After a while I finally spot her and made some serious eye contact until she figured out that we needed her.  The whole stop there felt like a waste of time and was accompanied by service that, while friendly, wasn't present when we needed it.

The original plan wasn't actually to go to Stingray tonight but I'm soooo happy we ended up here!  Bestie and I decided to do dinner once she got off work at Dry Bar and we were going to go to True Foods but there was a 35 minute wait and we were too hungry to sit around seeing and smelling everything to be able to handle that.  It was beautiful out so we were trying to find somewhere that had patio seating available and saw that Stingray had a couple free tables.  We were seated right away and giving some time to peruse the menus.  A couple minutes later our waitress, Elle, came over to get our drink order.  Now, Bestie is pregnant but has been craving beer forever and didn't see it on the menu so she asked if they had non-alcoholic beer.  Elle said that they did but she wasn't sure which brand it was so she told her she'd check and let her know.  When she came back it was a brand neither of us recognized so my friend was a little hesitant to order it but Elle made sure to let her know that if she didn't like it she could send it back.  Another issue with being pregnant is obviously certain foods you can and can't eat but Elle made that a lot easier for my friend too.  She told her that the foods with stars next to them on the menu were the raw ones so she should avoid those but she also told her that if she wanted one of the rolls that had raw foods in it she could have them not put them in so that she could still eat it.  We were both blown away at how helpful this girl was and she was super friendly the whole time too.  Food itself was awesome too!  I ordered a Dragon Roll and a Spicy Tuna.  BFF got a Dragon roll as well and a Las Vegas roll.  The quality of everything was excellent, very fresh and the flavors were wonderful.  The rolls were good sized too, I think there were about 8 pieces for each one so I was stuffed at the end of the meal.  I'm very happy that my friend is gonna be working 50 feet from this place so that I have an excuse to come in more often!

I'd never been to a dermatologist before so I didn't really know what to expect but my first experience was definitely a good one.  I had some itchy red patches on my legs that weren't going away so I finally broke down and made an appointment to get them checked out.  East Valley Dermatology Center had a good rating with a decent amount of reviews so I decided to try them out.  When I called to make my appointment the lady also let me know that I could print out all the paperwork online so that I wouldn't have to sit around and fill it out once I got there, definitely a nice touch I thought.  The day of my appointment came and I got there right at around 2:30 which is when they said the check in time for my 2:45 appointment was.  The lobby looked pretty busy so I was nervous I would be waiting for a while but I actually got called at 2:40, earlier than my actual appointment!  It took me a minute to realize it was MY name being called because I don't think I've ever been seen so quickly by a doctor's office before!  The lady who walked me back to the room got kind of the summary of what was going on and asked a couple other questions and then let me know that Yulia would be right with me.  Again I normally expect that to mean that she'll show up 20-30 minutes later but much to my surprise she really did come into the room less than 5 minutes later!  She made quick work of figuring out what was wrong and was very thorough in explaining what she wanted me to do to take care of it, even giving me written instructions so that I would remember.  She also had her assistant give me samples of some of the lotion and body wash she recommended and had my prescriptions sent directly to the pharmacy I use so that they would be ready by the time I got there.  Altogether I was probably in and out from check in to the appointment itself in under 30 minutes.  Now if that's not a record for a doctor's appointment I don't know what is.  Not to mention that the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the location itself was clean and inviting.  I don't want to say I'm looking forward to going back since that would mean something else was wrong but if I do end up needing to go I won't be dreading it.

Sooooooo good!  A friend and I decided to try something new for breakfast and we chose NCounter because it was close to where we were gonna be and it also had so many good reviews.  It turned out to be a great decision!  Service is fast because you don't have to wait for a server to bring you menus and take your order, you go right up to the counter and order off the menu they have displayed then they bring your food to your table once it's done.  A definite plus is that they do have a bar as well so if you want to order a Screwdriver with your breakfast, more power to you.  I definitely did!  Food itself is DELICIOUS!  I ordered the Bananas Foster French Toast and I was practically licking my plate at the end of it.  The flavors blended together perfectly and the portion size was good too.  Even the Screwdriver was made with fresh squeezed orange juice and you could tell.

Mmmm mmmm good!  I love me some Mongolian food!  Went with a friend on a Sunday around 5:00 and there really wasn't a wait at all which was great since we were hungry!  The host was very friendly as was our server who greeted us right away to take our drink orders.  As soon as that was done we made our way to the fresh ingredient area.  I was pleasantly surprised to see what I would consider an above average selection of various meats and vegetables available.  Marinated steak anyone?  Pineapple?  I think I will!  I also loved that you can pick from different options to go along with your food (steamed rice, fried rice, noodles, tortillas, and a couple others I can't remember).  I chose the fried rice and I'm proud to admit that I ate the whole bowl, it was delicious!  Next time I'm up this way I'll definitely be making a pit stop here!

I'd always told myself that eyebrow waxing was a waste, why pay someone else when you can just pluck?  But when I got in my car yesterday, looked in the mirror and saw all the hairs I'd missed, I decided I probably did need professional help.  This location is right by my gym so I stopped in to see what it was all about.  Come to find out, since I'd never been to a European Wax Center before my eyebrow wax was going to be free!  Definitely a good start to this process.  My esthetician was Becca and I really liked her style.  She was friendly but also very informative, making sure I knew what she was doing at all of the steps and making sure we were both on the same page with what I wanted.  I'm very happy with my eyebrows, so much so I'm mad I waited this long to get it done!  I'm definitely going to be making this a routine visit going forward.

I've been to a few different Genghis Grills and I have to say this location has been the best one so far thanks to their staff.  Everyone I came into contact with was friendly from the hostess to the guy stocking the veggies to the cook to my actual waiter.  They all said hello and made conversation as I went about everything which was nice.  My waiter almost verged on being TOO attentive which I know sounds crazy but in the 20-25 minutes I was there he came over to check on me 6 times and that's no exaggeration.  Not to mention he seemed to keep cleaning the same table and re-arranging the same chairs nearby my table multiple times.  He was nice though and it's better to have a server who's too attentive rather than one you can't seem to get to come to your table.  My only gripe with all the Genghis Grills has got to be the ingredient station.  Everything tastes wonderful when it's cooked but it just seems like no matter what time of day I go in, the ingredients look like they're last nights leftovers.  Just not very fresh looking.  I'm sure it's hard to keep them looking fresh as they're sitting out exposed but couldn't you just switch them out a little more frequently?

I think I finally found a nail salon that will be my go to from now on!  A lot of the other places I've gone recently have had issues doing the almond shape or stiletto nail shape that's popular now and it's kind of annoying.  When I sat down with Christine and told her what I wanted she got right too it and didn't have to ask anyone how.  The shape came out great, it was done well and in a fast amount of time.  I'm very happy with what I got and the prices are great!  So glad I found this gem!

Mmmm mmm good!  After going today I'm mad at myself for not going sooner because I've been missing out!  I ordered the Monterey omelet which is 3 egg whites, turkey meat, bacon, tomato, avocado and cheese and it comes with country potatoes and an english muffin.  All of those things were DELICIOUS!  The textures and flavors of the omelet just blended perfectly together, soooo good!  The country potatoes were awesome as well, a little crispy on the outside but still soft and fluffy on the inside and they had a great flavor as well.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it again so all I can say is go check it out yourself!

This Starbucks location just opened a couple weeks ago about 1 minute from my house but yesterday was the first time I actually made a trip by.  I used the drive thru and the person asked right away what they could get for me and repeated my order back to me to make sure it was right, which it was.  When I pulled up to the window the girl there was super friendly with a big smile which always puts me in a good mood.  My drink was ready right away and I was on my merry way.  I will definitely be making this Starbucks a part of my routine!

They serve sandwiches that you custom order for $2.99....that could be my entire review but I'll give more details just to paint a better picture.  You walk in, directly ahead you see the delicatessen counter and hanging above that a sign advertising custom order sandwiches for $2.99.  You'll ask yourself if it's a dream or not, how could such a deal exist when you've been paying $10+ for lunches everywhere else?  And how could you have gone this long without knowing of such a place?  Once you've come to your senses and regained composure you'll walk up to the counter and a slightly rude woman will bark at you to fill out the order form with what you want on your sandwich and to then leave it on the counter.  You'll take your time with your selections, making sure to compose the ideal combination of bread, meat, cheese and condiments.  When you've finished you leave the form on the counter to be prepared and try to make yourself look occupied as you wander the store waiting for your masterpiece to be created.  Then that glorious moment when your name is called, signalling that your creation awaits.  The only thing left is to do is pay and drive as quickly (while trying to remain safe) as possible back to whatever location you plan to eat at so that you may enjoy it.

Ended up here because the three other places we went to first sucked for one reason or another and this was in the vicinity.  There was a good amount of people here for a Friday night but not so packed that I felt like I needed to elbow someone in the face to get to the bar.  The music was good and the staff was friendly and quick.  My favorite part is the game room they have in the back of the club.  It's essentially a Dave & Buster's with a dance floor and better music.  I had a lot of fun and there's already been talk of making a second appearance here in the near future.

Obsessssed with this place now!!  Can't believe I'd never made it out here until yesterday when I went with a friend!  When we arrived there was a line of cars waiting to valet and the parking lot was full so I was worried it was going to be overcrowded inside and crazy busy.  Much to my surprise, although there were a lot of people inside, the layout is so open and gigantic that it didn't feel like it!  The servers were all SUPER friendly and not in a fake way, they're just really good at their jobs.  Food and drinks did take a little while to arrive but that was to be expected when a place has as many people as The Yard did.The atmosphere of the place is awesome too, just really a chill, fun place to come with friends and hang out.  Can't wait for the next time we go back!

I've always loved Barro's pizza but I hardly ever order it because I know if I did I would eat all of it in one sitting (one of the downsides/perks to living alone).  Then one day one of my coworkers brought in a little box and said they have lunch specials where you can get just a slice!  I decided to check it out on my lunch a few days later.  Unfortunately they stop serving the pizza by the slice at 3:00 and I got there around 4 so I decided since I was there I might as well just get a small pizza and then share with my coworkers.  The wait for it wasn't too long, about 10-15 minutes and I think it was only around $7 or so.  About the same as you'd pay for a lunch anywhere else.  It was hot, cheesy, melty, gooey, and delicious.  I still want to try to get there for a slice one of these days but I mean really any form Barro's pizza comes in you know it's going to be delicious.

I pass this place everyday on my way to work but I'd never stopped in until yesterday.  There's nothing wrong with steak on your lunch break, am I right?  It wasn't too busy so I was seated right away which was good since I was starving!  My server came over shortly after I was seated so didn't have to wait long for that either.  He was very polite and nice and I like how after you tell them how you want the steak cooked they describe it in detail just to make sure that's actually what you want, that gave me confidence that my steak really was going to be cooked to a wonderful, juicy medium rare and not cooked to death like some restaurants tend to do.  He also mentioned that they "boldly season" the steaks and wanted to make sure that was okay as well.  A couple minutes later he came back with the delicious, crusty honey wheat bread and the Caesar salad.  I thought the salad was a bit overdone with the amount of dressing but the bread was excellent.  The steak (filet) itself was wonderful.  PERFECTLY cooked, juicy, tender, great flavor, if I wasn't in public I probably would have licked the plate.  I had ordered the loaded baked potato as the side dish and that didn't disappoint either.  It was a good sized potato, nice and tender, with bacon, cheese and butter.  I'm now in a love-hate relationship with this place since I work within walking distance and it was so good it's going to be hard to keep myself from coming back all the time!

You would think it would be hard to screw up a concept as simple as Subway but this one has managed to underwhelm me on two separate occasions.  The first time I figured it was just a fluke, but going again today and getting the same service confirms that this is just how this place operates.  I walk in today and there's a couple people sitting at tables but no one in line so I walk right up to the counter.  There's a girl behind the counter standing in the doorway to their back room and she kind of looks at me but doesn't say anything or walk over right away.  After a little bit she finally makes her way over to me, still doesn't say anything and starts putting plastic gloves on.  Then I think she might have mumbled something but I didn't hear her, she finally made eye contact with me though so I went ahead and told her what I wanted.  She seemed to be doing okay with actually making the sandwich until it came to the veggies (maybe she's got something against them?) because she practically pinched the lettuce and spinach to put on my sandwich.  No handful sized servings here apparently.  When it came time to pay a guy was at the register to take my order and he asked the typical questions about whether I wanted it to go or not, did I want to make it a meal, etc. and then he gets to my total and says it's $6 something.  It took me a second but I thought about it and I only got a 6-inch sandwich with nothing else, so I asked him "How much did you say you're gonna charge me?"  To which he laughs and says, "Oh, you caught it!  Haha, April Fools!"  Ummmm.....I'm sorry but I'm not laughing.

Every time I get pizza from Saffron Jak I tell myself I won't eat the whole thing, that I'm going to just eat a few pieces and save the rest for another time but I have yet to be able to accomplish that goal... I have so far tried the Pepperoni, BBQ Chicken and the Buffalo Chicken pizzas and all of them have been delicious.  You can definitely tell the quality of ingredients is excellent and that they work hard to come up with new and interesting flavor combinations.  They also change up their specialty menu frequently so they could have a new offering each time you go.  I myself will definitely be returning to try and sample all of the amazing options they have!

I only recently discovered the deliciousness that is Jersey Mike's (which has now ruined me forever to the garbage that is Subway) but I'd only been to the location in Ahwatukee by where I work.  When I drove past this place with a friend after leaving the gym a different way than usual I actually turned us back around to get something to eat.  The menu, sandwiches, atmosphere all of that is pretty much going to be the same at whichever location you go to but I will say that the staff that was working the day we went in was great.  They were joking around with us and making actual conversation while we went through ordering and waiting in line.  My friend can be a little particular about how she orders and wants things which can sometimes annoy people at some places but these guys graciously did everything she asked without putting up a fuss.  Definitely a great experience.
