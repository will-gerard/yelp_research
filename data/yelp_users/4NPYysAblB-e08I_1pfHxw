Food was good. Did the med plate and it was good and super filling. Then did the Brussels sprout pizza it was good too. Wine selection is pretty bare. You can tell service is use to college kids and hipsters. We had a large party (15) and the service was pretty absent. Oh and the table was super weird shaped. Made it hard serve the people in the back had to pass the food to them. Otherwise nicely designed place. Good food.

Went to night had the spinach dip it was good but not really any spinach more like cheese dip. Also had the fish po' boy, good not great. Drinks were good. It's dog friendly which is always nice. Great ambiance. Nice for spring happy hour

Food was good but not great. Service was adequate but not what I would expect for that price and location. Probably wouldn't go back

So I really wanted to like this place but ..... The drive showed up with a tazer and preceded to charge it while standing next to my 2 year old nephew. (To show him). Then the antipasti salad was the worst I ever had. Lettuce was bitter and they give u ranch??  The pizza was cold and the wings were over breaded. They delivered fast and the soda was cold bit otherwise it was a bust
