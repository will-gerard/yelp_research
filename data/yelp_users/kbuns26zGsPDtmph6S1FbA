I had heard that it had live music, and by looking at the pics of the lounge, that's where I wanted to take a date. I went on a friday night, at it was so-so busy. As i sat there, i was appalled at what I heard. I might as well have been at a dueling piano bar. Don't get me wrong, the musicians are good, but that room screams for classy jazz type entertainment, not people taking requests for zepplin. In my opinion, they're trying to use "young-type" music to attract crowds like blue martini does so well up in City North. If anyone from their management reads these, please don't try to be what you're not. Emphasize what's unique about yourself

A lot of TV's, so that's good. The bartenders are really sexy and good mixologists. And also it seems that Poker is a nightly event there.  Their Happy hour during the week is good, 2-4-1's on drinks, 1/2 off apps. Their wings were good. Classic style, unbreaded, thank god...  I also was there earlier this evening for the NBA Playoffs, had their Turkey club. It was pretty... what's the word... typical. store bought turkey, low grade lettuce. So if you're trying to eat healthy, probably not the place for you. I think this will be make local hangout!! Peace out!
