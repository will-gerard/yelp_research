Dave has been nothing but extraordinary. Our ac unit stopped working and Dave identified the problem, found the part needed and had it up and running within 24 hours. Thanks for the quick and timely service. Such a sweet man and felt like an old family friend. Honest, trustworthy and great pricing.

I won't be back. Decided to give this place a try because of all the great reviews. My gel manicure is lumpy and one of my nails is crooked. I also had a pedicure and while I appreciated the  time they took for the callus remover and massage the actual nail color turned out terrible. You can tell where a second was painted and where it wasn't. Overpriced for what I received. I will stick to my normal nail salon. It was worth a try.

Love this place! New owners are excellent and I followed them from a previous nail spa. Best nail salon around.
