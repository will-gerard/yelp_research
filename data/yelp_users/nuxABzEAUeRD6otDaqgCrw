Scandelesque is by FAR the best Burlesque troop in Arizona, even though burlesque is only the beginning of the genres of entertainment they perform.  Not only are they professionally trained dancers, but truly creative and unique, always reinventing themselves.  They are also extremely professional which can be hard to find in entertainment fields.  Aside from enjoying their shows on a regular basis, I hired them to perform at my Wedding and they made it extremely special!  My guest loved their performances and yours will too!

Listen. I am fine with a dress code at a respectable establishment. Especially when the majority of the people down stairs are in flip flops and tee shirts ... BUT They turned us away because one of us did not have a "collar shirt". However he did. I tried to explain to the goon bouncer that it was a mandarin style collar which just happens to be different then the standard turn over collar but IS in fact a COLLAR. Dress code beware. They will judge your collar even if they don't know anything about it .  This was the second time  I brought out of town people across town to enjoy the bar on the top floor and they turn us away because one of my guests was not up to their standards.  I have been in Orange Sky a hand full of other times with no problem, but won't bother going back there because I don't  want to "gamble," on getting in.
