Had a great car buying experience.   Steve Rotonda and Bob Banes were both awesome to deal with. I was in-and-out in just a couple of hours, which was what I told them I needed to happen.  Would I buy a car from them again?  Of course.  Thanks guys - see you in a few years.

:: DON'T GO HERE ::  It simply isn't worth it, and I am not just talking about the food.  The food is "meh" at best - nothing special at all.    We tried it for breakfast and we had the ham and cheese omelet and the kids french toast.    Wasn't horrible, but wasn't great either.  Why the 1 star?  Because they don't validate parking.  Which means when your total breakfast tab is less than 20 bucks, you are going to pay 12 bucks for parking unless you are lucky enough to get a spot with a meter right in front of the restaurant.  Oh, and there are no signs that tell you they don't valiate parking - you just get to learn it the hard way.  Or read this - and simply skip this place.  Trust me, you aren't missing anything - there are plenty of other great places within a 5 block radius to go to breakfast.

I have heard about Flancer's for years... and yet I had never been there until yesterday for lunch.  Had the Philly Cheesesteak because our waitress said that it was the most popular item - and I can see why.  It was big and it was great.  Service was friendly, it didn't take long to get our food once we ordered it and the Cheesesteak was fantastic.  Yep, I will be back!

Queen Creek.  I have to admit that when I think of somewhere that is "good to eat", Queen Creek doesn't exactly come to mind.  That is... until I went to The Deli.  It is located in an unsuspecting place and in my opinion, the location is something that makes it even more appealing -- the food is good enough that if the location was slightly more hip, you wouldn't be able to get a seat there... ever.  Last night we brought our kids there and everyone had a sandwich. Our 5 year old had peanut butter and jelly (I thought it looked odd that they toasted the PB/J) and when he took his first bite his eyes lit up and he said "hey, this place is gooooood!"  So if nothing else, your 5 year old will love the PB/J.  Our 11 year old liked the pre-meal "snack" of some-kind-of-almost-hummus along with home-made crackers - and then everyone loved the sandwiches.   I had the hot roast beef -- and it will be difficult to switch from that option for a while.  No one had dessert this time, but after reading the reviews it appears that we missed out so next time we are back, we will be sure to try it.  We also bought some hummus and pickles (both made right there) to take home -- and both are now gone the next day.  Is the Deli good enough for you to try?  Yep.  Even if you have to drive to Queen Creek.  Just don't everyone go trying it at once -- I am going to be a regular and don't want to have to wait in line to get in.

Ok, look.  I spent the better part of my 20's and early 30's not drinking coffee so I can't consider myself a life-long coffee snob.  But I learn fast.  And after learning that Starbucks is not the end-all, be-all when it comes to coffee - I can almost say that I am no longer a complete rookie when it comes to great coffee.  And in my opinion, Echo Coffee is great coffee.  Top off the great coffee with free wifi and a top-of-the line interior fit and finish of the building and this can probably be declared the best-little-coffee-shop in this part of town.  It just opened today and I got an iced coffee, straight. No sweetener, no additives - just the straight dope.  And yes, it was fantastic.  But I have to admit - I have a big problem with this place and it is one that I will be wrestling with for some time...  It is a little too far from my house to go every day.  Which begs the question: is this place good enough to cause someone to sell their house and move just to be close enough to go to it every day?  I will if you will.
