We had a great time watching the Cardinals game at the 65th St & Greenway Zipps tonight, even thought the Cardinals lost (the atmosphere was great, NOT the game). The server Mary did an excellent job ensuring that our water glasses were filled and our beers were full. Being the nice husband that I am, I texted my wife to see if she wanted me to bring food home for her. She loves the chicken fingers so before I left, I put in my order. When I got home, my wife asked me why I brought back onion rings with a side of fries. They were  super-busy, so I can understand how this happened; no big deal. I proceeded to call the restaurant and was transferred to the General Manager Matt. Matt explained that Zipps policy states that the food must be RETURNED to the restaurant in order to make any adjustments. Needless to say, I live 20 minutes from the restaurant and this wasn't going to happen for a $7.50 order. Matt was extremely rude and unhelpful and gave me the number to their corporate office. I've been a customer since they opened their first restaurant Goldies Sports Caf√© but I won't be returning any time soon. Matt managed to lose a 15 year customer in less than 15 minutes. Too bad because I really enjoyed Zipps.

Amazing stadium and excellent views of the field, no matter where you are sitting.

Great stadium, but I do have 2 complaints. First, they need more bike racks for those of us that live nearby and don't want to deal with the congested parking (although Zipps Sports Grill has a nice solution for that). My second complaint is that they don't have free WIFI. I have AT&T and get TERRIBLE cell phone service at the stadium. You would think that a brand new state-of-the-art stadium that was recognized as the "2011 Ballpark of The Year" would have thought of this. I would love to give them 5 stars if they addressed these concerns. Aside from this, SRF is by far the best stadium to catch a game!

Make sure you order the day before so get your food in time. If you come at night, expect to wait 30-45 minutes.

I bought a $21 voucher on Living Social to have my tile and grout cleaned. My wife and I spent several hours moving everything off the tile in preparation of the appointment. I received an e-mail (not a phone call) 26 minutes prior to the first appointment informing me that they would not be coming that day. This was frustrating since I had worked my schedule around their "availability". We rescheduled for the following day and yet again, they cancelled. At least this time they gave me more notice; 47 minutes. This appears to be a one man show and they apparently can't keep up with the almost 400 vouchers they've sold. Fortunately Living Social was understanding and refunded my money. What a waste of time and energy.

So glad they moved up north. The staff is wonderful, the ambiance is perfect and the food amazing! You can't go wrong with the bruschetta. So many options and no matter which ones you choose, you won't be disappointed!
