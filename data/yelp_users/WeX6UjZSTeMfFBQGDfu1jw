I thought Phoenix was supposedly an advanced airport hub? If so, Terminal 4 did not get the message. This place is run down and needs a makeover like nobody's business. Don't expect any great eateries. If you need any candy, snacks or large waters, make sure to get them immediately after you go through security since only some slim packings after. Hungry? Coffee Bean, Wendy's and a Mexican fast food spot will have to suffice.  2 stars because they did have TSA pre check and that makes my life a heck of a lot easier. My homegirl does not have pre check and mentioned the security line was painful. No one working and things moving real slow.  A little dingy, a little dirty and very sparse, this airport could use a rehaul.

Wow. I may never be allowed in Pittsburgh again. I just straight up wasn't impressed by this sandwich. I went halfsies on a pastrami and cheese and their Pitts'burger' which is like a long cheeseburger between slices of bread. All sandwiches are suggested to come with the works: slaw, tomatoes and fries. (Fries are inside the sammy).  First of all, quality just wasn't there for me. The fries were super soggy, the bread is like a soft white bread, the kind where your fingers make imprints upon touching and the thing was all slaw. The pastrami was ok (my man liked it much more than I did) and the Pitts'burger' was definitely a let down, all I tasted was that slaw and bread. It was cheap for 3 sandwiches the meal rang up to to $21 and some change but, I, who never leaves a plate empty left half of a sammy behind.   Looking back I bet the colossal fried fish sandwich would be banging with the combo of slaw and that white bread but for the other sandwiches, they were just nothing special. I wouldn't recommend as a place to try when visiting Pittsburgh and friends in Pittsburgh, no offense but, come to NJ and I'll show you a sammy.  * Cash Only. ** Open 24 hours - which is pretty awesome, I'll give it up.

You know how people go on these awesome quests to discover all the best of certain things, mostly food dishes? For example, finding the best burger, the best pizza or the best taco joint, etc... Well, if you're making that list for Eggs Benedict, I think you may need a pit stop at Restaurant L'avenue in #Montreal.  We snuck in before a 30 minute wait and grabbed the last table by the door in this ever so hip, yet a bit small restaurant. With only French menus, I did decipher a few things, but our lovely waitress in a hurry let us know that they are known for their Eggs Benedict.   We ordered up 2 sets of Bennies, his with Montreal smoked meat, swiss, mustard and of course hollandaise and mine with mushrooms, garlic aioli, bacon and hollandaise. They arrived about 15 minutes or so later. Cold. Boo, but silver lining is that they were still some of the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had.That hollandaise sauce was superb. So light and airy, with hints of lemon, but oh so rich and creamy with the perfect consistency. The flavor combo of the mushrooms, bacon and garlic confit was heavenly and oh so different in the best way possible from the rich and salty bites of smoked meat covered in dripping yolk. If it was a tad bit warmer, the dish would have been unquestionably one of the best things I've eaten in a while.   If this wasn't enough, the dishes were accompanied with perfectly seasoned breakfast potatoes and a skewer of delicious fresh fruit. I was stuffed to the gills by the end of this proper brunch and although Eggs Benedict are quite gluttonous, I didn't feel too heavy or guilty.  So this leads me to why this review was not five stars. Our service lacked a bit, hence cold food. Not sure if this is a regular thing here, but they were severely understaffed. Granted it was a Monday at 11am and they were slammed, but with only 2 servers for the 50 people seated, I'd imagine that was why our food was cold. Another negative was that the coffee sucked, comparable to dirty diner coffee with the creamer packets on the side.  The other dishes being served look magnificent and in a foodie city like Montreal, when there's a savage line on a Monday late morning, you know whatever they're serving must be good.   Bonus: One of the coolest, if not THE coolest bathrooms ever. Worth the trip even if you don't have to pee.

So I want to start that my man and I didn't have crepes so I'm a little biased. I had an omelette with potatoes. First, the cafe is super cute. Definitely a French vibe and it's location not right on the main drag in the Old Port area makes this a neighborhood gem and looking at others devour their crepes definitely a solid spot. The omelette was good. Nothing crazy, or anything you'd see on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives but just a small omelette with some fresh ingredients. As someone on a diet, I was stoked to have some roasted potatoes to accompany the omelette as advertised on the menu, but instead they were deep fried (womp womp). I sampled a few for the sake of this review (the things I do for Yelp) and they were of course awesome but again, these home fries were deep fried. I didn't eat the bread but it was thick cuts of fresh bread. Carbs, hmmmmmmmm.  Overall a definite solid spot for a moderate priced lunch. I'd come again when I can eat some crepes and those fried potatoes!

Question 1. How the hell do people in Montreal stay as thin and svelte as they do with places like Resto La Banquise perpetually having a line? Question 2: How the hell can you have a menu with only about 25 different types of poutine and a few hot dog and hamburger options and perpetually have a line? Question 3: Why hasn't the poutine crazed infested NYC (I know it has been tried in the LES but, really, that's it?).  Questions I pondered after waiting in line in the freezing Montreal winter cold for 25 minutes, being cramped at a table for 2 and eating 2 small orders of poutine: one, the classique, the other, the smoked meat with pepper sauce.  Surrounded by Quebecoise families (all skinny and French speaking may I add) and tourists alike, this poutinnerie has been deemed best poutine in Montreal. Hmmmm. I wouldn't say that. But, it was solidly good and there is definitely a poutine wow factor with the amazing long list of varieties from Mexican Poutine topped with guac and sour cream to the pizza topped with pepperoni, mushrooms and peppers.  I preferred the classique version over the smoked meat and pepper sauce version though having the combo was definitely a smart move. Too much of the same taste would have been old and definitely not worth the calories. The smoked meat however wasn't filled with flavor and was a bit of a let down.  In and out in like 30 minutes filled to the brim with delicious gravy covered fries with cheese curds = 4 stars. Worth the wait for the poutine? Hmm, I don't think so. Worth the wait for the tourist factor and feeling part of the local scene and being able to say you've dined here to locals? Yep.

New Years Eve and my man romances me at a whole in the wall spot in Montreal's Chinatown. I will give it up he tried calling 100 places last minute but NYE, similar to places in NYC fill up fast and have $100 tasting menus and the food is never as good if you go on any other night so, why not go cheap, quick and delicious and get to the bar more quickly to celebrate with some bubbles?!  First of all Montreal's Chinatown is great, same vibe as Chicago's. A few main streets chalk full of dumplings, bahn mi's, and other delicacies. The Yelp reviews were positive and Risa D stamped this one as the best so, done.  The dumplings were amazing. But, just a heads up, this place ONLY serves dumplings. There are a few salad apps but, you are here for the dumplings and dumplings only. We went with all steamed varieties ranging from pork and leek to lamb and coriander (!!!) and finished it off with beef and onion. With 15 dumplings per order and at about $7 per order you get a lot of bang for your buck. Sweet.   All were fabulous, I do want to highlight the lamb dumplings which I don't think I've ever had before and happened to be the winner winner chicken dinner of the meal. The other dumplings were just as great but the lamb had this extra kick to the meat. I also want to highlight that these dumplings were plump dumplings. Plump with juicy meat and with the skins being thin, the filling flavor really came through. Praise the dumpling lord, that's what I'm talking about. This place is super authentic with lovely lil' ladies in the back rollin' those dumplings as you eat. So fresh.  My one gripe was they wouldn't give us water. We asked twice. Water never came. Dumplings and sauce are pretty salty and the free hot tea is really nice but, I really wanted ice cold water man. Whyyyyyyy?  Regardless, this place was legit.

I don't tend to hate on other Yelper's reviews but really, how can you not give Le Vieux Montreal five stars?! I'm questioning your review skills all of yous who deemed this historic center and old port four stars.   For those who've never been, Le Vieux Montreal is the old part of Montreal consisting of an area made up of cobblestone streets, amazing restaurants and ever so hip pubs and bars, the St. Lawrence River, museums, beautiful old churches, European architecture, art galleries, and so many more uncovered gems. I have spent days walking along these streets and enjoyed every second of it. I have yet to be during the summer but, even in dead of winter, with snow blanketing everything, and the cold numbing your face, I can't imagine a more special place in a North American city. You fall in love with everything around you. Yes, it can be touristy but, that's because it's f*%&$* amazing.   J'adore Montreal, j'adore le Vieux Montreal.

I asked a local where to hit up brunch in this hood and he directed me here. A little French bistro with a great menu filled with salads, sandwiches, egg and crepe options, this little place was packed on a Monday afternoon.  I went with the sandwich and soup combo for $12. The chicken club and a cup of creamy tomato (though as the waiter mentioned, the soup was not too creamy, just a hint). The sandwich was large with delicious crunchy bread and what tasted to be a homemade garlic aioli. I loved it. The chicken was sliced thinly so you could actually get your mouth around the sammy (we are clearly not in Jersey anymore). The soup was perfect with chunks of vegetables; I couldn't have asked for a better lunch. It was large but not too big where I felt like death after.   Service was amicable if not a wee but unprofessional, food was more than agreeable. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood and need a nice little lunch spot.

I love Montreal. Adore. Obsessed. It may be chalked up to the amazing European style architecture, the beautiful local crowd, the fact they speak French and it is also because Montreal has a plethora of amazing restaurants. Le Gros Jambon is one of those restaurants where you love Montreal a little bit more while you dine here.  Located in an old diner like setting, Le Gros Jambon is located on the cusp of the Old Port near a bunch of hotels - the Westin, Embassy Suites, Loft, etc.. which if you are staying in one of those head here. Don't go with a group as literally this place has NO tables, just counter space. When glancing the menu, you smile. Diner food but with a gourmet, gastro twist. I was debating between the duck blt and the coca-cola burger, and the owner said to try the burger. A burger topped with coca-cola mayo, caramelized onions, a fried pickle, lettuce, tomato and a delicious bun this burger was gonna be legendary. I opted for the poutine on the side for a +$4.   Did I mention reggae was playing in the background? I'm not talking about some best of Bob Marley ish, I'm talking Lee Scratch Perry, some old stuff. Yes.  The food came out. The burger was near perfection minus a few main factors: It was overcooked. I don't know if they cook burgers here well but, no pink in this bad boy. I was never asked how I wanted it cooked but, this is how they serve it. I do like my burgers a wee bit bloody so it was a bit of a let down also, you couldn't  really taste the coca cola in the mayo and if a burger is named after one ingredient, it better damn as well taste that way but, damn that fried pickle was amazing. Maybe rename to Fried Pickle burger, since that was clearly the star of the show. The burger did have so much going on and all the flavors went really well together. The poutine was really good, a great taste to the gravy, loads of cheese curds, perfectly fried fries. Yes. Now, was it legendary as it sounded? No. But, still solidly good for the $12ish price tag.  I would definitely recommend coming here especially if staying/living in the area. This is a gem of a "diner" and their unique twists on some classic favorites along with their super chill/hip diner atmosphere make this a no brainer. If asking for the burger maybe mention you'd like it medium? (If you do indeed want that).  Full bar as well!

I really enjoyed the Graduate Tempe. They spent a ton on remodeling the place, and I gotta say: #NAILEDIT.  Let's talk rooms: Not huge, but nicely sized. Luxe bathroom soaps and shampoo (Malin+Goetz), so no need to lug your expensive bottles with ya. We had the king rooms with a little balcony which, hey, it's always nice to enjoy a little alone outdoor time. The beds are super comfy and they don't penny pinch on those pillows. Hipster decor, a mini fridge and a nice flat screen tv. I'm gushing, guys!   Note: This isn't an upscale W. This is more like The Ace style hotel. Hip more than luxurious.  *** Note: My company paid a group rate. Note:  I know nothing about Tempe/Phoenix area and have nothing to compare this to.  Not only are the rooms great, but the pool isn't shabby. A ton of space to lay out and even some ice cold water and margarita service from the adjacent bar/restaurant. The pool happens to be open 24 hours. Score. Hot tubbing at 3am? CHECK.  They do have an onsite Mexican restaurant/bar that is solid. Not the best Mexican, more of the decent/ a bit healthyish gringo style Mexican. Regardless, pool + marg = pure happiness.  The conference room is a delight. A ton of natural light making sitting in there for 8 hours not horrible.  The rooftop bar wasn't open while we were there, but man, if it was, I'd of been all over that. A great vista, a huge space, well designed. Hell, a great place for a wedding/birthday party/you name it. We ended up doing some morning rooftop yoga there from the local CorePower studio and it was a total win.   Service is wonderful, the space is wonderfully designed and it definitely felt more like a vacation stay vs a work stay, which I mean that's the dream, right?  5 stars, Graduate. Stay fresh.

What a great spot for lunch or dinner. If you can snag a table or bar seat on their delightful patio, you'd be an idiot not to!  Let's chat about their homemade sauces and hot sauces. Great variety and great flavor. Let's chat about their spicy guacamole and freshly fried tortilla chips. Each bite had a little kick to it making it totally unboring.  However, my caesar salad was boring, not gonna lie. The grilled shrimps were tasty, but overall the salad was huge in size, but not on flavor. I definitely added a ton of hot sauce and the garlic crema to add a bit of a kick.  My friend's tacos were touted as big, but they ended up not being huge. She's also a veggie and probably ordered wrong. And when I say probably, I mean she did. I'd also suggest ordering the flour vs corn tortillas as they looked absolutely authentically, hand made.  The brussels nachos were delicious but not what one expects. Their nachos are just your regular nachos with some brussels involved, not brussels sprouts covered in nacho cheese and the works, which is what I really wanted and so does everyone else in the entire world.   Service was wonderful. The cocktails looked wonderful. All in all, a huge win.
