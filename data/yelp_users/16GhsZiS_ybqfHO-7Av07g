We went to this restaurant for a group meetup.  The restaurant was very good when it came to reserving and setting up our large table.  We enjoyed being in the company of others.  That said, the food was sorely lacking.  Their chips and salsa are supposedly "award winning".  In all fairness, the mild salsa was unique.  It had a wide range of ingredients in it and was  tasty.  The spicy salsa was indeed spicy but there was nothing about it to make it stand out from other Mexican restaurant salsas.  The chips were unusual.  Some had the consistency of a deep fried pie crust.  In other words, they were very flaky.  Yet others were like chips found in other restaurants.  For my drink, I ordered a frozen mango margarita with salt.  The mango flavoring was faint and there was very little salt on the glass.  For dinner, I had a combo plate --- one chile relleno and one chicken enchilada.    The dish came with refried beans and "fideos" (noodles with a meat sauce).  The chile relleno was the worst one I've ever had.  It held together very poorly.  For example, when I was less than halfway through it, I cut off a piece with my fork and out came the entire remaining chile!  What was left was the batter and the jack cheese!  The chicken enchilada was generous with the chicken portion but pretty forgettable.  The fideos were certainly a unique touch and pleasantly flavored.  The restaurant was very good when it came to accomodating those in our group who were vegetarians.  They were willing to substitute sides that had meat in them for a vegetable side dish.  Service was friendly, prompt and helpful---no complaints there.  That said, I certainly won't go back when I'm in AZ.  Without going into too much information, the whole meal left me with a bad case of indigestion.  There is certainly much, much better Mexican food to be had in the Phoenix area!

Wow!  Who knew that there was such good Italian food in Mesa!  The desk clerk at our hotel gave us a list of restaurants in Mesa and took the time to point out his favorites.  He told us that Tutti Santi had fantastic lasagna---and he was right!  We went on a Thursday night around 5:30.  The restaurant wasn't very busy and thus our large party of 5 adults and 3 kids was seated immediately.    We started the meal with 2 appetizers---calamari fritti and eggplant parmigiana.  The calamari was fried to perfection---not rubbery at all.  The sauce was a spicy tomato one which complimented the calamari wonderfully.  The eggplant was very tasty with no bitterness.  The breadbasket was excellent.  It had pieces of foccacia and cripsy Italian bread.  However, the star was the whipped garlic butter.  It was so tempting to go overboard on the bread just to have that butter!  The main courses came with your choice of a house salad or the soup of the day.  The house salad dressing was a balsamic vinaigrette and the salad had tomatos and mostly romaine lettuce.  The soup of the day was  spinach egg drop.  I had a taste---it was truly unique.  It had the consistency of a Chinese egg drop soup but was infused with Italian spices and some pepper to give it a kick.  For entrees, our party had the following: veal parmigiana, gnocchi with Bolognese sauce, lasagna and ravioli.  The person who ordered the ravioli was inspired to do so due to the hostess.  I mentioned that I heard their lasagna was really good and the hostess said it was but the ravioli was even better!  I had the gnocchi but also got to sample the ravioli and the lasagna.  The gnocchi was very light in texture (not heavy at all) and the Bolognese sauce was well flavored without going overboard with the ground beef.  I was impressed with the lasagna.  First of all, the portion size was quite reasonable plus it wasn't too thick.  Yes, it was very tasty.  The ravioli with tomato sauce was also delicious.  The cheese was mild and the sauce complimented it very well  At the suggestion of the waiter, the kids got penne with a butter sauce.  It was a great idea for a meal for a preschooler as the kids ate it all.  At the end of the meal, we were all too full to even think about dessert.  Nevertheless, the waiter brought a plate with tiramisu on it plus serving spoons for all.  Again, we all enjoyed it.  Sometimes the coffee flavoring in tiramisu can be overpowering and bitter.  This time, it was in proper balance---not too rich and not too sweet.  My Dad, who was with us and is well-traveled, told the waiter that he thought Tutti Santi was one of the best Italian restaurants he ever went to anywhere and gave it 5 stars.  While I'm nowhere near as well-traveled as my Dad, I had to agree with him --- this place deserves 5 stars.  The only drawback---service can be on the slow side.  So go expecting a leisurely dining experience and you won't be disappointed!

As for the food at Chevy's---I say *meh*.  It's not horrible but it is eminently forgettable.  We hadn't been to a Chevy's in years.  There used to be one in Sterling at the mall but it had long since closed.  We tried it once and the one thing that stuck in my mind was "El Machino"--- the machine that's highly visible by the entrance where you can watch an employee making tortillas.  As a result of El Machino, the tortillas are probably one of the best things about the menu.  Those same tortillas are what is used for the complimentary chips and dip.  Other than that, the rest of their food is *meh*.  We went to the one in Mesa because we were looking for a place that was kid-friendly.  Chevy's fit the bill in that case.  Yet the kids all had---hamburgers!  LOL!  I had a combo platter and chose a chile relleno and a crispy taco with carnitas.  The chile relleno was just ok---I have had far better.  As for the taco---the best part was the carnitas---I have to admit they had good flavor.  Our son-in-law had a chicken burrito and liked it.  My husband had a taste of Chevy's platter---which, well, had a taste of several menu items.  He was not impressed.  I had a frozen margarita which was just OK.   The adults at our table had a good laugh when the waitress carded me!  I'm thinking that this Chevy's got in trouble in the past for serving underage patrons.  I mean---I'm well past the legal drinking age---there's no doubt about that LOL!  Our waitress was friendly and prompt---no complaints at all about the service.  Yet---I can't help but wonder what the attraction to Chevy's is in a place where there is far better Mexican food around...?

We were looking for a good spot in Mesa for a multi-generational dinner.  Someone in another forum recommended Anzio Landing.  It was a great recommendation!  We had 4 generations present at our meal---the oldest (my Dad, age 84) and the youngest (age 7 months, our grandson).  The staff from the manager on down couldn't have been more accomodating and friendly.  From the time we first walked in the door to the time we left the restaurant, we always felt welcomed.  Service was great with only one glitch---the waiter forgot to bring one drink.  The manager came by and that was pointed out to him.  He apologized and had the drink out very quickly.  We started the meal with calamari which was cooked just right---in other words, it wasn't rubbery.  The coating was quite good---flavorful and crunchy.   Much to our surprise, the 3-year olds even liked it and wanted more!  The following main courses were ordered---lasagna, grilled chicken, beef ravioli, tortellini, and Anzio spaghetti.   The beef ravioli was a generous portion---large raviolis served with marinara sauce and melted mozzarella cheese---tasty but filling.  The lasagna portion was huge!  It came with something I never saw before---fried spinach leaves which were surprisingly good---light, yet crunchy with a hint of olive oil.  The Anzio spaghetti was also a generous portion with spicy Italian sausage, meatballs and mushrooms.  The tortellini was well liked by the person who ordered it --- same for the grilled chicken.  All entrees came with a house salad and garlic rolls.  Whenever I see "house salad" on a menu, I always ask the server what the dressing is.  The server said it was a "Caesar salad type dressing".  I don't like Caesar salad but the server told me that it was surprisingly good and not at all like what one thinks of Caesar salad dressing to be like.  He was right!  I found it to be very flavorful and thankfully absent of that strong cheese flavor of typical Caesar dressings.  The garlic rolls were bland---I had hoped for more of a garlic flavor.  Plus they weren't truly authentic Italian bread.  When you enter the restaurant, you are greeted by a sign that says their creme brulee is "award winning".  With a title like that, how can one resist?  So two of us decided to split one.  It came with a flaming sugar cube on top---something I had never seen before!  I had to agree---it was some of the best creme brulee I ever had!  It had a firm crust that was complimented by a very flavorful custard.  One person had some spumoni which I tried.  It, too, was good quality.  We had hoped to be able to see planes landing while we were dining.  Unfortunately, since we went for an early dinner, the sun was still strong so the restaurant shut the blinds.  As the sun set, the blinds were opened and we did see one plane land---something the 3 year olds enjoyed.  The total cost with the  restaurant-added gratuity for our large party was $185.  Only two adults had alcoholic beverages---the rest had soft drinks.  I do recommend giving this restaurant a try---not only for the food but for the warm hospitality shown to us all.

I look forward to going to the Sugar Bowl when I'm in Scottsdale.  Old time ice cream parlors are a vanishing breed in the US.   There are so few places left where you can get an ice cream soda.  That's why I really like this place!  There are so many ice cream treats that are not found elsewhere.  Plus, as others have pointed out, it's nice to see a place that has withstood the test of time---especially in a high growth area.  So many places come and go but the Sugar Bowl remains.  Do pay it a visit if you like ice cream!  The service is friendly and prompt.  Just remember---when you are ready to pay, you don't pay the server, you go to the cash register and pay.

Once we went to Grimaldi's in Hoboken, NJ and weren't all that impressed.  Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldi's, we were blown away!    Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.  When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.    There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.  There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.  Everytime we're in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!

One thing I've found about IHOPs---service and cleanliness vary from location to location.  This IHOP is one of the cleanest we've ever been to plus service has always been consistent, as has the food.  I recommend going for breakfast which, IMO, is what IHOP does best.  We've never been disappointed when we've dined at this IHOP.

I so wanted to try a Buffalo Wild Wings but for the longest time, there wasn't one close to where I live.  So...when we were in Mesa last week, we seized the opportunity to try it.  I had heard good things about Buffalo Wild Wings thus I was looking forward to trying it.  So, sadly, I must say that I was disappointed.  I ordered the spicy garlic wings but what I got looked and tasted like ordinary buffalo wings.  They had no garlic flavor what so ever.  It's a good thing I only ordered 6 wings!  My husband, who isn't a fan of wings, tried their burger and pronounced it to be *meh*---pretty forgettable.  After reading the reviews here, I'm glad we went for an early dinner.  When we went on a weeknight, we were the first dinner customers of the evening.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Still...if I hear that my experience wasn't par for the course, I would be willing to try it again, but not in this location!

Our daughter recommended this restaurant to us.  Although she had yet to try it, she knew several people who had and really liked it.  So one morning during the week, we went for a late breakfast.  When we got there, the place was doing a good business.  Still, there were available tables and we were seated immediately.  Our server was kept busy but still came to take our order in a reasonable amount of time.  The breakfast menu is huge---somewhat overwhelming.   There are skillet breakfasts, omelets and more traditional breakfasts.  We decided to try the "traditional eggs benny" (basically eggs benedict).  The person who brought them out appeared to be the cook.  The eggs were properly cooked which sometimes doesn't happen with poached eggs.  The potatoes were flavorful and not at all dried out.  Overall we were very pleased with the whole dining experience.  Next time we're in town, we'll be sure to go back!  Just a note:  We heard that the place is a very popular brunch spot on the weekend so if you want to avoid crowds, go during the week.

Now that we've had a chance to try some other items on the breakfast menu, it's a good time to update the review.  Recently, in addition to the Traditional Benny, we tried the California Eggs Benny, Traditional Breakfast and Breakfast 222.  Also, we tried two dessert items---Brandied Cinnamon Bread Pudding and the Lemon tart.  This place, generally speaking, is consistently good.  The only thing, IMO,  they could improve on is their poached egg preparation.  Sometimes the eggs get poached just right, other times they are overcooked.  All that said, the California Eggs Benny is a delicious and unique breakfast.  In addition to the English muffin and Hollandaise sauce, it has spinach, bacon, avocados and tomatoes.  It all works well together and is very tasty.  The Traditional Breakfast and the Breakfast 222 are very similar.  Both have 2 eggs and your choice of meat.  Where they differ is that the Traditional  has potatoes plus toast, although you can substitute pancakes for the toast for a little extra cost.  The pancakes are buttermilk and, IMO, are better than IHOP.  One day we got tempted by the dessert menu. I ordered the Brandied Cinnamon Bread Pudding while my husband ordered the Lemon Tart.  The bread pudding was delicious!  Our waitress got it right when she said it didn't taste like typical bread pudding.  It has a blackberry sauce and is topped with fresh whipped cream---it's simply decadent.  The lemon tart, however, was not your typical one.  It's thicker than usual and the crust not as crispy.  Still, my husband enjoyed it.  You know, we've never had a bad server in the place.  In fact, most have been friendly and efficient.  If we thought we were treated badly, we wouldn't go back.  In fact, we think that this is a great breakfast restaurant!

I was wandering around the Tempe Marketplace while my husband had planted himself at the Barnes and Noble, and I came across Tea Infusion.  Hmmm...I thought to myself, it would be nice to have a cup of hot tea.  So, I peered in the window and saw that place wasn't too crowded then in I went.  The tea menu is huge!  The woman behind the counter explained that I could get a cup of any tea that I liked.  So...I said I'd like the Creme Brulee tea and...she said "Sorry, we're out of that!"  Ok...try again.  I spotted another tea with vanilla flavoring..."How about that?"  And she said...you guessed it!..."Sorry, we're out of that".  Then she recited a list of other teas they were out of---all with vanilla flavoring---all were teas I would have liked to try.  Then, sensing that I was about to say, "Thanks anyway" and walk out, she started telling me about different teas.  Bringing out different tins and talking up the virtues of each, I finally settled on one that had vanilla and orange---and I can't remember the name of it and their MySpace website is of no help either.  They had some cupcakes on display that were very attractive and came in miniature or regular sizes.  She told me they were lemon.  I decided to have a miniature one with my tea and sit down at the high counter by the door.    The tea was hot.  Yes, hot tea is supposed to be served hot but this was scalding hot!  I let it steep the requisite 5 minutes while I ate my miniature cupcake which, by the way, was tasty.  However, it took forever to drink the tea because it was so hot.  The tea was a disappointment---very little flavor came through---only faint hints of orange and vanilla.  They have food items, too.  A woman sitting near me was eating an attractive looking salad that reminded of a Caprese one.    The place seems to have a good number of regulars that eat there.  They sit at the counter and shoot the breeze with the woman who works there.  Some of the customers had me thinking that they were ASU students as I was one of the older ones in the place LOL!  All in all, it was a somewhat disappointing experience.  How is it that they could be out of so many teas?  Maybe the food is worth having, I don't know---and never will know either as I won't be back.

We discovered Pita Jungle when our daughter gave us a newspaper article that discussed the best places for vegan/vegetarian dining in the Phoenix area.  Pita Jungle was on the list and since it was near our hotel, we decided to give it a try.  It's not strictly a vegan/vegetarian restaurant---it does serve entrees with meat, chicken and fish.  Upon first entering, we noticed that the decor was nothing to write home about.  However, we feel that doesn't matter if the food is good.  We were greeted by our server who told us to pick a table and she would bring us some menus.  She was very friendly and helpful.  In fact, she talked us through the menu---even making some suggestions.  Surprisingly, despite the restaurant's name, she suggested not ordering a pita sandwich because---as she put it---you can get pita sandwiches in many other places.  She also warned us that their entree portions were huge.  We decided to go with two of her recommendations.  I ordered the Lavosh Sharwarma Wrap and my husband ordered the Lentil Fatoosh Salad.  About the Lavosh Sharwarma Wrap---Lavosh is sometimes called Armenian cracker bread and comes in a crisp or soft version.  This wrap had the soft version which still had a cracker like consistency.  It was very tasty---the chicken was moist and flavorful, the grilled vegetables (tomatoes and onions) were well prepared and complimented the chicken quite well.  However, the garlic sauce which had a mayonnaise look and consistency was on the bland side.   This sandwich comes with a Greek salad.  I asked the waitress if I could get the salad without Feta Cheese since I'm not a fan.  She said that was OK.  The salad had lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers and Kalamata olives that had pits in them.  The dressing was a lemon vinaigrette.  All in all a great meal.  And, yes, it was quite filling.  I ended up bringing half the sandwich to our daughter!  About the Lentil Fatoosh Salad.  This consists of lentils and rice with carmelized onions over mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, pita chips and lemon vinaigrette.  My husband---much to his suprise---really enjoyed it.  I tasted it and agreed with him.   The flavors melded very well together.  Again, he also couldn't eat it all and our daughter got some of that!  When we asked our waitress for boxes, she said, basically, "See?  I told you it was a lot of food!"  To drink, I had their freshly made lemonade and it was very refreshing---not too tart yet not too sweet---and refills were free!  My husband had an orange flavored Pellegrino water.  He was quite surprised to see that on the beverage menu!  It's too bad we're not planning any more Arizona trips as our daughter is moving or we certainly would return to this Pita Jungle!

We went to Garcia's for a dinner.  Our party was large---6 adults, 2 toddlers and a newborn.  The restaurant gladly accomodated us.  They had high chairs for the toddlers but no sling for the baby carrier.  However, that was resolved by putting the baby carrier on a chair.  The restaurant is typical of Mexican restaurants in that they bring out the tortilla chips and salsa.  What was different, however, is that in addition to the salsa, a bean dip is also brought out.  Both were quite spicy---not spicy enough to burn your mouth but still noticeable.  The portions for the main courses were huge.  I ordered a make your own combo platter with a chile relleno and a shredded beef taco.  The taco was good.  The chile relleno was unusual in that it was the spiciest one I've ever had!   Chile rellenos are--as a rule-- a mild dish.  I asked others in our party what they thought about their meals and they, too, found theirs to be spicier than usual.    Service was excellent.  The waiter was very attentive and patient.  We would go again next time we're in town but now know to expect food that's uniformly spicier than usual.

Papa Murphy's is a pizza place with a unique concept.  They sell you an uncooked pizza that's assembled right before your eyes.  You then take it home and bake it according to the given directions.   We went there one evening and got a pizza with Canadian bacon.  Papa Murphy's also sells raw chocolate chip cookie dough.  Again, it comes with directions.  Soda comes in 20 oz. bottles and only Pepsi products.  Hint:  If you like Coke products, just go next door and get your soda at the Subway Sandwich shop!  The pizza directions are pretty straightforward.  However, we found it strange that the instructions said to puncture any bubbles that appear while the pizza is baking.  A pizza crust without bubbles?  How strange!  Needless to say, we ignored that instruction!  The chocolate chip cookie dough also comes with straightforward instructions.  So...how did this all turn out?  The pizza was unremarkable---no better than a store bought fresh pizza---and that was disappointing.  Somehow, with such a unique concept, we were expecting better.  As far as the cookies go---what was odd was that they gave off no smell when baking.  When you make homemade cookies, they tend to give off a tempting aroma that has you waiting impatiently for them to be done.  So...the cookies were ok.  However, we've had better.  If you do get one of their pizzas, get it knowing that it won't be any better than what you would get at the supermarket.  However, the one advantage that Papa Murphy's has that the supermarket doesn't---you can customize  your toppings.  Otherwise, the staff was friendly and efficient.  When making our pizza, they made it incorrectly but quickly spotted their mistake and made us the pizza we ordered.

Well...since I'm on a roll, having reviewed two other Teavana locations...well, what the heck...might as well review this one, too!  This is the smallest Teavana I've ever come across (and it's the fourth one I've been to).  It's about the size of a walk-in master bedroom closet in a luxury home.  So, needless to say, trying to buy tea when the place is busy is well...ummm uhhhh...an adventure.  We were in AZ last month to visit our daughter and her family.  One thing we all like to do is visit the Fashion Square Mall.  So, while wandering around, we spotted Teavana.  My daughter and I decided to go in as I offered to buy her some tea.    In recent months, Teavana pared down their tea selections.  However, I swear the selection at this Teavana was a lot smaller than the ones nearest to where I live.  We had a very helpful clerk who showed my daughter various teas which helped her settle on two she would like to try.  While the clerk was putting the teas into bags, I figured I would grab a box of tea bags.  Good thinking on my part --- I ended up buying the last box in the store!    Getting to the tea bags wasn't easy, to say the least.  The place was crowded---so much so that I turned around to move toward the shelf where they were and I bumped into someone!  After we bought the tea, before we left I asked the clerk if they had a list of their teas.  Usually you can count on Teavana to have those around.  Two clerks told me that they ran out of those lists!  All that said, Teavana has great teas.  Once you start drinking their teas, it's awfully hard to go back to supermarket teas LOL.  In effect, you become spoiled.  If you like tea, visit a Teavana and pick out some you would like to try.  Just remember---if the place is busy it's best not to go if you're in a rush.  So save your visit when you have time to spare.

Given a choice of fast food burgers, when I'm in In-N-Out Burger territory, In-N-Out wins everytime.  Like most other fast food burgers, theirs is a thin patty.  The patty itself is good but I think that it's the sauce and the bun that make the burger distinctive.  The menu is uncomplicated---You can get a single burger, a double burger or a cheeseburger.  Plus you can get just a burger or the combo which comes with fries and a soda.  I tend to get my cheeseburger without the onions because there are way too many onions on it for my liking.  For me, too many onions can overpower the rest of the contents.  The fries are quite good when fresh and hot.  When they cool off, they're just so-so.  The buns have good flavor.  Most fast food burgers come with a tasteless, bland bun but In-N-Out has a very flavorful one.  To me, it tastes buttery with a  hint of salt.  The sauce looks like French dressing but yet adds a decidedly different flavor to the rest of the toppings.  I wish I could explain just what that flavor is---I only know that it's good!  One drawback---the burgers come out wrapped in white paper that exposes half the burger.  This is ostensibly done to make it easier to eat.  Yet...under the white wrapper is a brown wrapper and I can't tell you how many times I've taken a bite of my burger only to later discover that I bit off some brown paper and ate it along with the burger LOL!  Oh well!  A little extra roughage is always a good thing :)!  Every In-N-Out I've been to has been very busy to the point that sometimes it's tough to find a table---Even tougher when you have a large party.  In-N-Out attracts a diverse group of people---young and old, rich and poor and everyone in between.  Good for them for having such a huge customer base!

The main reason we seek out Hot Dog on a Stick is for...the lemonade!  It's perfectly sweetened and refreshing on a hot day.  While we tend to go for the regular lemonade, we have also tried the cherry lemonade.  And you know what?  It's all good!  I wish Hot Dog on a Stick was near where I live!  When we head to the Southwest, a trip to Hot Dog on a Stick is a must-do.    Yes, we've tried the hotdogs and liked them.  However, while good, we don't long for them when we're home.  The lemonade is another story!  The Hot Dog on a Stick in the Fiesta Mall has never disappointed us.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  One time I asked for a small empty cup to pour a little lemonade in it in order to take some medication that has to be added to a small amount of liquid.  The staff gave me a cup without giving me a hard time or charging me any money for it.  In conclusion, if you haven't tried the lemonade, I highly recommend that you do so!
