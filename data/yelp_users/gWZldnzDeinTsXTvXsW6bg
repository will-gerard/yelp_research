Well... The food may have been a little closer to the mediocre side, but the service was great! I had what my gf always says as a "boring breakfast". Chocolate chip pancakes, and a side of ham and an egg. The pancake was a little dry but the ham was pretty good. Coffee was average, eggs were average. But they did have some decent things on the menu. I do like that they brought out an entire carafe of coffee, and water so I don't get stuck paying 2 bucks for a tiny cup-o-joe w/ no refill, or trying to flag someone down for one. Nice! But our server was great. She apologized for the OJ spilled all down the side of her previous to our visit. It did look bad though. lol. When I went to pay they were the guy asked me how everything was and what I had planned today. I sincerely appreciate people who enjoy their job, and make your experience enjoyable.   In short: Service, 5 stars.... Food 3 stars...

Oh where to start..... Went here last weekend on a Friday and the place was maybe 10% full. Yet I was asked why I did not have reservations. *looking around* are you serious?? They had like 20 plus tables that were not even a third were filled throughout the whole evening. The patio had so much potential, however having no lighting I was not the only one struggling to see the menu. By the end of the night we were lit by a cell phone glow of people around us trying to read their menus. How romantic!  Drinks: The extremely watered down sangria that tasted like white grape juice with A SINGLE canned peach slice stuck to the bottom. Just nasty. Even the water smelled like mildew and I didn't dare touch the dried out lemons.  Appetizer: My fiance ordered the Fiaggi Misti (meat and cheese assortment, supposedly) It consisted of Oscar Meyer look a like garlic bologna, even worse "sopressatta" that looked like a hunk of fat, and two choices of tiny pieces of dried out cheeses. Oh yes, let us not forget the store bought bread sticks brought out in their packaging still, on top of the assortment still in the damn wrappers, stuck between 3 kalamata olives. What the hell do I do with all the wrappers now? Beyond disgusting. Worst part is that they charge $15 for the damn thing!!   Dinner: Now I enjoy my pizza well done. I just do. Don't ask, just make it happen, ok??! The Toscana pizza that we ordered, was neither well done, and had Wal-Mart quality ingredients. Terrible mozzarella, soggy whole mushrooms, and bland sausage with zero fennel, whatsoever. The sauce was more of a bland paste than a sauce.   Waiting 35+ minutes for the bill when asked several times ensured the zero likely-hood of us ever returning. EVER. But with two servers for the entire place, what did we expect?

Carne Adovada.... Ugh. What can I say?! I usually don't even like beef. Spectacular. Get it to share though. I ate it for the next three meals. Coffee was also better than i had expected. Not that I was complaining. Great atmosphere, great food.

Sooo I had my hair done here about 2 weeks ago. And I really wanted to like this place.... Unfortunately, not the case. I don't feel like cutting off maybe 2 inches of my hair and getting it dyed (yes no highlights, even though I was charged for them) should've taken 3.5 hours, where I may have gotten one of the worst cuts and most definitely worst color. I also don't feel it is appropriate to charge professional pricing when I got a best, someone with student skills. And what is the point in making an appt when they don't start for another 30+ minutes. Lastly, if you make an effort to advertise a special for yelpers, and you know I am a yelper, I mean we even talk about reviews, at least offer it to me. Not that I would've stayed there a second longer, but nonetheless, they could've offered. Sorry to say that the whole experience was bad, from walking in the door to jumping out of the chair almost 4 hours later.

Well. that sucks. stale bread. no chips. mediocre service. eh. whats all the hype about?   Oh and ps- when and I call and tell you I ordered a fruit salad and I didn't get it, it's not rocket science. Just say I can come back and get one. Don't get all confused and argue with me just because your brain can't compute the words I am saying!? Rude! Better luck next time.   ** for those of you that have a problem with my review, feel free to email me and ask any questions you like. I wrote this review by MY own means, and based on MY own experience**  A couple things I forgot to have mentioned, was their way over priced baked goods. The cupcake I got was so oily I could barely choke it down, and the iced tea was so overwhelming I had to poor half of it out and add water. Maybe, I went on an off day, maybe not, but this is my experience of this establishment. Take it or leave it.

Well, I have to say, as a woman. Not impressed.... I went to this "barbershop" which should've clued me in, for the services I was going to be receiving...   I work with someones daughter who is the front desk girl, who was really nice, and had suggested this stylist. They gave me a half off coupon (i hate that word) and one for a free haircut. So I was like, sweet, I'll try it, why not?  Well needless to say, it STILL cost me over $75... That's before tip...  The stylist that they had suggested was really nice. I was told she was very experienced and had done many hair shows before, so maybe I was expecting to much. Like I said, she was very nice, and when I told her  what haircut I wanted and how I wanted my hair dyed I thought I was in good hands. I usually do an a-frame with blonde highlights. Since I'm going on va-ca I wanted to spice it up a bit. So I asked for a few pink streaks. Needless to say, the 3+ hrs I spent there was a total waste of time! When she put the blonde on my hair I sat there, not under a dryer because of course they didn't have one, for almost 2 hrs! By the time it was done, my hair didn't look like it had been touched! The pink pieces were ok, it just kind of got on other pieces of hair. It was really sloppy. The haircut was just your run of the mill basic cost cutters. Nothing special. Kinda choppy. When I left my hair was still wet, and not styled. When I got home and actually dried and straightened my hair, I was so mad! My gf suggested I call back and see if they could fix it. SO I called the next day and the phone rang and rang and rang. It went to voicemail. SO I left a message. I never got a call back, so I called back a couple hours later. When I called back I talked to the stylist and she told me that she had put the blonde highlights in and I could come back for more if I liked. I asked her how much it would be (mistakenly thinking she would fix for free since I sat there for 2 hrs for NOTHING) and she said it would be $55 and since I was just there, they would give me half off again. Needless to say, I didn't schedule. I rather put my money to someone who is willing to keep my business.

ohemgeeee. I LOVE this place. Have come here many a time with my gay boyfriends for everything from H&H to brunch. Peanut butter and mixed berry compote waffle with banana topping, SO good! For an evening snack the chipotle mac is also great, but def big enough to share. Sangria is hit or miss but the coffee is always on! Service has usually been ok, but sometimes it does take a little long to get the check. There is just something about the cute ditsy waitress I always get, that I don't really mind waiting.

Can't ever go wrong with the happy hour here. MY GAWD! Oh and to make it better, it is pretty much allll the time. Watch out for the frozen sangria though, it'll get cha! Take a seat on the misty patio, and service can be spotty, but nothing that my frozen sangria and a little portabella mushroom and brie fondue can't fix.... and its where the best people watching is!

Words can't even begin to describe how much I LOVE this place!  Sanctum has taken over the old E Lounge building and totally done a major overhaul. I felt like I was stepping into the Madonna "Like a Prayer" video. It is so dark and dungeonous mixed with the likes of a Catholic church.. Pews and all! I really can't get over how much they changed. Across from the bar is this step up, kind of lounge-ish section that has all this comfy seating and creepy depictions of the devil. It reminds me of an old library. The bathrooms are kind of unisex (I didn't realize that the first section had a huge "W" hanging from the ceiling) lol...The sinks were these beautiful red glass and had an incredible chandelier hanging above. They really spared no expensive on every little detail! Nice size dance floor, with great music. Kind of house/trance like. It just really all went together. I felt like I was stepping into a hot club in Manhattan.   Aside from the amazing decor, the drinks, may have been a tinge over priced, (my Three Olives and tonic was like 7 or 8 bucks) but to me, your really paying for the atmosphere. There is also a cover charge on Friday and Saturday nights, but get there between 9-10 and your free. Otherwise you will be shelling out 6-8 bucks depending on the night. I just really hope this won't hurt them since they are so new. But I hear the owners of this bar, are the same owners as Amsterdam, and clearly they know what they're doing!   All in all, great service, great mix of all kinds of people there (gay, straight and everything in between), and I can't say enough about the atmosphere.. 5+ stars! I can't wait to make this one of my new spots!

Glad to see this place still up and running! Still pumping great tunes, with the best bartender Stacy serving up heavy poured drinks!

My girlfriend took me here on her suggestion and neither of us were very impressed. I got the green chile burrito and the meat was cold and tough and the lettuce was really wilted. We got take out, and I obviously didn't notice until I got home, so I called and spoke with the manager and he offered to make me another one and also gave me a free dessert. When I got in my car, drove back down and was made another one, it was also less than to par when I got back home. The red velvet cake I got was not very good either. The icing on it was like glue and the cake had a reminiscent taste of coffee grounds. Bizarre. I will say the customer service when I went back in was excellent, and the manger Will was great, but I sadly can't say that for the cooks in the back.

Stopped in here between flights on my last leg home from Spain and really enjoyed the little place. Nice decor, sushi wasn't bad, but the customer service was outstanding! $24.95 for all you can eat sushi, (or by the roll which is what I got) for anything on the menu. Down side no sashimi, but the baked lobster roll was awsome! Skip the miso though, the seaweed is a little too chewy!

Most friendly restaurant I have been to in a LONG time. Got the double burger and fries. Very juicy and the perfect size. Only downside was I prefer to have my patties cooked more well done. Much to pink. Fries were great, my dad loved the onion rings. Very well priced. I appreciate that for my vegetarian brother, they cook all their veggie patties on a separate flat grill with the buns. I feel like a lot of places don't pay attention to things like that. Lots of choices for non-burgers, Ahi Tuna steak and chicken sandwiches even salads. Great little neighborhood burger joint. Can't wait to come back and try something else

After spelling my address out MULTIPLE times the person taking orders still gave the delivery person the wrong address. So 40 minutes past the delivery time we finally got our pizza. Not that I was very hungry after an hour and half... And it's a good thing I wasn't because the pizza was terrible. Here's the breakdown: Very little sauce with very little flavor.  The "double bough" was just two crust literally laid on top of each other and was a cardboard texture Oh ya, half our pizza was MISSING cheese. Like it looked like a dog just grabbed it and ran The wings were undercooked and day glow orange that tasted straight from Chernobyl  And now I'm hunched over in the bathroom with the worst stomachache I've had in the better part of a decade.   AVOID AT ALL COSTS...  Now for an update:  So after waiting on hold for a manager for over 10 mins, I told the manager I just wanted him to know about my exceptionally poor experience. After many excuses about a new person taking orders and blah blah he then proceeds to tell me that we couldn't "get sick" from the wings because they are "precooked and we just reheat them" WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F$&K?! Do you take a food handlers card? Do you know how bacteria grows?! I was blown away. Like are you really going to argue with me?!   Now for the kicker; here's how they tried to resolve things.  1. Offer me an $18 credit for a future purchase. - REALLY? You couldn't even offer me the full price I paid which was $22. Come on!  2. Then he said instead he could send us over another order and "trade in the food". I mean my jaw dropped to the ground. Trade the food in?! Like what do you can re-sell it?? Oh and did you miss me telling you how sick I feel?!   This totally solidified my firm stance of never EVER going there again.
