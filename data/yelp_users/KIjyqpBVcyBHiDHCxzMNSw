Absolutely terrible. Had 2 meals delivered, this was horrible. Both dishes. They should be paying me.  I ordered delivery and due to the minumum was required to spend a certain dollar amount, no problem, ordered two entrees, figured I'd have the other the next day.  The food delivered was as if it had been sitting in a bin for many hours as everything came dried out, cold and no flavor.  the sweet and sour shrimp didn't even have the sweet and sour sauce.  they gave these little to go packets of hot sauce and duck sauce.  First and last time I eat from this place.  I can't find away to take away the one star I've given this place.  Oh well

Don't know how anyone can give a good rating to this place. I haven't gone in years ...and it's my closest station....cause the service sucks....guess what it sill does .  Car wash does a lousy job.   Cashier basically accused me of trying steal $2 worth of gas trying to fill a gas can for my mower.

Food is exceptional. Fish is fresh. Drinks are cheap. A little slow sometimes, so have a drink and chill.

Always have great things to say BUT. If you're going to close at 7:45 then thats what should be posted on your sign not 8:00.  Its a burrito. It'll take about 4 minutes to cook

I'll give it 5 if when I come back and the coffee is still this good. No signage so not the easiest to find but look for world of rugs.  Good coffee
