When you combined taste, price, and portion size Pong Pong can't be beat and the best part is they deliver too.   Every time, i have ordered food at Pong Pong it has come out hot, fresh and quick.   I have eaten almost every dish on the menu and have enjoyed them all.      They do have a good priced lunch menu as well.

This is one of my lunch time favs.  They have a good lunch menu and the pho is really good too.   Service is hit or miss and they keep it really warm during the summer.

I have only had the Gyro and Beef Souvlaki, but they were both really good.   Its a small place but does have several booths to sit at.    The meat they use is really tender and has a good flavor.   Portion size are what you would expect as well as the prices.   I am looking forward to trying more items on the menu.

The Good:  The Salsa is pretty good, they give you both a hot and a mild with your chips.  They also provide a bean dip that isn't bad either.      The Bad:   The food is nothing special.   I got the shrimp burrito and all it in it were bean, rice and five shrimp.  For $12-$13 bucks i was expecting a little more.    My wife had the carne asada tacos and wasn't that impressed either.  We went on a Friday night and they said it would be 20min wait.  No big deal it is a Friday night I thought.  But when we were finally sitting down half the place was empty.    So i didn't really get why we had to wait.  The waiter was unorganized, he gave us a check that had items on it we didn't even order.   To top it all off, its was really hot in there.   Its Arizona in the middle of summer for god sake.  If your going to serve sub-par food at least keep the place cool.

I really like this place.  The pot stickers, onion pancake and the pork patty are my favorite dishes.  Everything is really fresh.    The owner is really friendly and will help explain dishes to you that you might have questions on.  I have also gotten the frozen pot stickers to take home and they were good too.

Stopped by here one night when i was hanging with some friends.  I found the bar tenders to be rather rude and not interested in helping the customer.    The venue is really cool and does have a great vibe but bad customer service isn't worth it.

The food here is pretty good.  I have been here a few times and tried different items each time and enjoyed them all.   The prices are decent as well.  The people that work there are super friendly and it has a nice dine in area with a flat screen tv.     If you work near the state capital complex it worth stopping by.
