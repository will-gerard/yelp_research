This restaurant is probably the most authentic Phoenix has to offer. The staff was friendly and the food was okay.   I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and was surprised at what I received. It was not the Vietnamese bun bo hue but another dish that kind of resembled it. I felt as if I was eating pho with a hint of some other spices found in a typical bun bo hue dish.   The house fish sauce tasted like it came straight from the fish sauce bottle. I was actually pretty impressed with the peanut sauce though.   I am aware that Phoenix does not offer a variety of Vietnamese restaurants but this place will get the job done.

I was actually quite impressed with this pho restaurant. It was pretty busy for at 1:40pm on a Wednesday afternoon.   I never order pho tai at a pho restaurant and decided to take a chance here. I was not disappointed by my choice at all. The broth contained a lot of flavor.   I highly recommend this place for pho!

I love the strawberry green tea with black pearls! It's hard to find a drink that isn't too sweet! Coming from the fat straws in Texas, this place will do just fine!   I highly recommend this place!

I ordered the turkey, egg and cheese bagel breakfast sandwich and it was DISGUSTING. The egg resembled a sponge and there was way too much cheese. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ordering this.   I had to ask the people there to cut my bagel sandwich in half which is a basic procedure at any sandwich bagel cafe. The overpowering cheese made me nauseas and didn't even bother finishing the remaining bagel sandwich. It was just gross.
