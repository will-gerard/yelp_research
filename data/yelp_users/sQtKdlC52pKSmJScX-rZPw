This is hands down the best Chinese food in the valley. A true hidden gem. Fantastic food, great portions.

Absolutely useless. If you are interested in waiting 35 mins for food when there are 13 people in the restaurant...then this is the place for you! Better yet go on a Wednesday and get the all you can eat wings. You can get 10 and hopefully that's  all you can eat because that's all you will get. Like Chris angel your server will disappear and not bring you anymore. The most awesome part is that your wings will be dry. The problem with this restaurant is the manager is a 40 year old virgin and had no control over the women he manages. They bat their eyes and wave their "magic orbs" and he shuts up. It looks like he has tried to improve this place but like a said its hard to enforce rules when there might be that 2% chance. NEVER AGAIN!

Well this bar in a great spot. Past that no thank you. Overlooked fried food and the worst pint of Guinness I have ever had. I think the tap lines were last cleaned when bush was in office. Horrible service and bartender seems to be an old trailer park manager.

They kind of washed my truck. It sucked. The wash, the service all of it. There is some fat guy that looks like porky the pig who writes the wash tickets. He will throw a fit and call you a tightwad if you don't want to upgrade to the mega stupid expensive wash. Don't go here find a donation car wash or anything drive through a sprinkler this place is the worst!

Great bar! Food is excellent! One of the last places you can get a guiness poured properly. Atmosphere is great. Service is off and on. This place is quickly becoming a gay bar, not that that's bad IDGAF. Just noting that.

This is the best bike shop in the west valley quite possibly the entire valley! Ray is the man. Personable and fair, no elitist who's or attitudes. I went in for service on dare I say a wal mart bike, and got no attitude just honest help and spectacular service. They also have a huge selection of bicycles and gear. I was not disappointed and you won't be either. Definitely my long term local bike shop!

This is for the coffee side. One barista doesn't cut it especially when she wants to bs with her hipster bff's.  35 mins for a simple coffee drink is bat s**t crazy. No thanks

So they gave is an extra egg roll we brought it to their attention. They asked for it back then put it back on the serving tray after it was given to someone else. GROSS!  Iced tea dispenser, no lid with bugs floating around at service of the iced tea. I brought to their attention. They said. "Oh don't drink tea then" disgusting. Not recommended. Food was inedible after that. GROSS!'nn

Liars! The guy we spoke too tried to nickel and dime us on things that are standard anywhere else. When we declined he chastised us. Then spoke to me like I was ignorant trying to cover his hustle. Not recommended!

Overpriced bland mexican food. Atmosphere doesn't fit the place and feels awkward. I was really surprised to find that even during happy hour my girlfriend and I had a $49 tab for 2 meals and 3 drinks. I would avoid this place at all costs. I mean you are on the westside of the valley where you are not more than a stones throw in most any direction for really good mexican food. It's akin to going to somewhere like Kansas and having mexican food where the average patron has no idea what traditional mexican food tastes like. No bueno.

This is by far the best Greek restaurant in the valley. And I would venture to say the best restaurant in the west valley. Fresh delicious great customer service. Welcoming atmosphere.

My 3 year old daughter Saw the pictures of cupcakes in the window and insisted we stop in for some. I normally would shy away from "boutique" style bake shops because usually it's not worth the money. In this case it definitely was!! Planning on supply my daughters upcoming birthday party with cupcakes from Gigi's. best cupcake I've ever had.

This is one of my favorite breweries in Arizona. The beer is awesome. A wide variety that rotates often. The food is amazing I would go there just to eat even if I didn't drink beer, but I do and theirs is great!in all seriousness the atmosphere and the staff make this place. Super relaxed and unpretentious. Big thank you to Omar we will definitely be back!

Well there is food and a lot of it. About 20% of it is edible the other 80% is questionable. The fragrant and aromatic scent of rotting meat hits you as you walk in the door. The room temperature seafood will keep you coming back for more. NOT! go somewhere else. This place is no good!

This place is amazing. As far as I'm concerned this is the best in the west valley. Generous portions and quality meats. The cheese puffs and spring rolls are crisp and very good, none of that haven't changed the dryer oil in 2 weeks taste.  Chai boba tea! Well it's awesome. Highly recommended.

There is a reason this place has 5 stars it is amazing. Tacos, burritos. All of it is amazing. Friendly customer service. Really cool atmosphere. Clean and comfortable. Great salsa bar. I am sitting in the parking lot writing this review. Wishing my pants were bigger super full. Great place just go there and eat. Sample the meats when you get there.

The food was edible and could have been a lot better. Typical bowling alley French fries and a bland dry tasteless "cardiologist" burger. Has potential but there is nothing special. My main gripe with this place is the beer situation. Anytime I go somewhere and they actually have good craft beer in excited. This place has good beer. But no one there knows anything about it. There is no rotating tap list so you have to be in the bar or walk over there to see what's on tap, the server had no idea. Also you can't serve every beer in a mason jar.  I get that it goes with the theme but it's dumb.
