I love comedy and this place used to be amazing. Now it's a major money drain. I ordered two beers. 12oz in a bottle 7 bucks each. With my first beer I ordered a soda water out of the fountain and they charged me over 5 bucks. For soda water. No restaurant charges money for a soda water unless it comes from a bottle which I always ask about first. Then the last slap in the face is an auto grat of 15%. There were only two of us. I totally get an auto grat on parties of 6 or more but for 2?   It is really disappointing when you want to go out and have a good time and leave disappointed due to the business practices.   The comedy was fantastic :)

Best new downtown joint for sure. This place is great for all sessions. The brunch is delicious. Lunch and dinner are on point. The patio is amazing. I am curious to see what it is going to be like in the dead of summer. Might be a bit too hot to hangout there unless they have a nice misting system with some large swamp coolers hanging out.   This place is our first go to for going out on a Friday or Saturday night. Great vibe and atmosphere.

I have been here 5-6 times now and never have I been disappointed. The food is great. I had a salad this time. I tried the P3. It was delicious. Could have used a bit less dressing. The salad was swimming ;) Next time.   The beer is always good and cold.   The hottie pizza is a favorite but be careful. It is one hot sunufa beep.
