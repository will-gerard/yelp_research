This place has great Mediterranean food! They have a market and a restaurant. The food is a good price, and it is a lot of food that they give you. I've gotten the gyro and the lamb is very tender and I am not a hug fan of lamb. The hummus is the best hummus I have ever tried. The service isn't amazing, but it is true ethnic Mediterranean food. The people their are very nice.

The lunch specials are a good price, the deliver in the downtown area, which makes it easy for my work. the good is just alright. I have ordered form her twice, and was not impressed. But my coworkers and I have not found another Chinese place that delivers to downtown phoenix. I have gotten the chicken vegetables which had this weird texture sauce with it and the chicken lo mien was alright.

Love this Fry's! The manager is very friendly and nice. The manager always opens up a cashier whenever it starts to get busy. They are recently remolded and have just about everything the fry's marketplaces have.

DO NOT EAT THERE!! DO TAKE OUT! The service is horrible. But the food is amazing and cheap! My boyfriend and I made the mistake of eating there, and we were so irritated about the service, but once we got our food it really didn't matter be uses the good was SO good! We had the orange chicken, low mein, and broccoli and beef. The beef was kinda fatty and was not of fan of that. The chicken was really crisp.

This Denny's has fast service. My boyfriend and I always come here. We have tried a couple other Denny's in the area, but this one always has the best service.

The place was great! Greeted with 3 smiling faces and 1 already had menus and seated is right away. We went in at about 8/8:30am and they had quite a crowd, but not packed. Our food came out fast, coffee was really good. My boyfriend got the gooye scramble, which was really good. The pancakes have a hint of something In them that makes them different but GOOD, they are nice a fluffy. The toast was a little on the hard side though. Everything else was great, nice atmosphere with lots of natural light. Definitely will be back!

Went here last night for some dessert. I found out about them on Yelp. The cookie cup with the macaroon cookie was delicious! They had so many flavor a to pick from. The only thing I did not like was that the names of their ice creams were very odd and so the names were not self explanatory. I got the morning mess which was a combinations of 3 cereals. I got it with the red velvet macaroons. It was a lot of ice cream! And only like 7 or 8$. Working at coldstone in the past  this place was pretty cheap! And the customer service was great. They didn't have enough thawed out morning mess so the guy filled my cup up with another ice cream I asked for but he proceeded to also give me a little cup of what they had in their freezer. He said it was too frozen to put on my cookie cup.
