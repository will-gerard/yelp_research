I freakin love this place I always come here when I get those pho cravings. The people there are always friendly, the food is always great, and them prices are easy on the pockets. I would definitely  recommend this place to anyone looking to get some pho.

I went to this place with my girlfriends family after her brothers graduation. When we got there we asked our server for a quick minute to look at the menu. The server didn't return for 20 mins, she takes our order then gets my girlfriend's mother order incorrectly after we clearly stated and reiterated for her before she left. Food was okay but not worth it for the poor service we received
