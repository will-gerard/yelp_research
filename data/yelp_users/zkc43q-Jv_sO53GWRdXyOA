I love this place, and I understand that for a UFC fight, there is gonna be some backlog. But the two hour backlog in the kitchen and not being able to put in a food order is ridiculous!!! Haley has been an amazing server and totally deserves a raise though!!!

OK, I meant to do this like a year ago (Sorry Justin), I have lived in this apartment complex for over a year now and absolutely love it!!! The residents are all pretty friendly, minus my old neighbor. The grounds and facilities are all in tip top shape, up until recently. The heated pool and spa's are in need of heater replacement. But overall there are only 2 things I can even think to truly ding this complex on, and that is the lack of guest parking near the back of the complex, and the heater situation with the heated pool and spa's. The Office staff are all amazing Heather, Justin, and Meghan are totally helpful and super friendly. They are always willing and able to respond to any issue that I have in a timely manner. Would definitely recommend this property to anyone looking for a place to live.

So, I moved away from Metropointe when my last lease was up in order to save some money before finding a new place. After looking at quite a few different properties I ended up back at Metropointe because while I could have gone to another apartment and possibly paid less, the office staff at those other places were nowhere near the level of the office staff at Metropointe! I will gladly pay a little more in rent in order to have office staff make this place feel more like a community than anywhere else!!!

So, I finally went to Zipps last night with my roommate. It wasn't too packed even though it was game one of the World Series. We sat in the bar area, and started off getting nachos. The server did a great job and was very attentive, but the amount of chips definitely left something to be desired. We both ordered a different foccaccia sandwich and were totally confused when we got our food, 35-40 minutes later. I know that foccaccia is a type of bread and was expecting the sandwich I ordered to be on that bread, when in actuality it was a wrap. This struck me as odd, now our server did an excellent job except that we were not even offered a refill of the chips we got, and the food took an ungodly long amount of time when the bar itself was not even that busy.
