I live in Old Town so getting Indian food that I enjoyed meant going to Tempe or Chandler....Thanks for fellow yelpers, I checked it out on a Sunday...the service was great until it got busy.  Quick to realize that the two servers on the floor were not only the servers but also the host/hostess and bartenders.  It didnt matter because the food was great...I am no connoisseur of Indian cuisine but haven had dined well over 3 dozen times at Indian establishments, this place did just fine.  The location is not ideal since you are forced to park in a parking garage although AZ88 is right there for drinks after.  The decor was in my opinion a fair attempt to an authentic Indian restaurant.  We ordered nothing outside of the basic chicken curry, naan, saag paneer, rice pudding (best I have ever had), mango lassi (not very cold or thick but good), and the galub jamun (which tasted like it had been frozen and thawed....only thing I didnt like)  Overall, I really enjoyed it and will be back when the craving for stuffing myself on Indian food revisits me.

Love this place.  The area is great although the location in the strip mall, to me, is not the best.  The food is always amazing and anyone who dines here needs to ask about the forbidden rice.  Interesting color and amazing flavor.  Love how they serve their wines by the glass, too.  Check out how the wine is poured behind the bar....have never seen this before.  I would love to eat in the large group room because it simply looks like a fun set up...all glass.  The dining room and patio seating is great and our server was on it plus funny.  A Scottsdale classic and probably one of my favorite spots.  I need to go there more often.

Although this is what I consider one of my favorite restaurants in the Phx metro area, I just can't bring myself to give it a full five....dining in the lounge is a must from the (sometimes) live music and impressive people watching.  If their service was that much more "on it!" ,decrease the average patron age by 10 years, have the band's play music from my generation, add a few more Malbecs to the wine list, and other than that, this place is perfect.  The price for the food is right although in no way cheap, the lobster mashed potatoes, are always a must.  For any dessert lover, most menu items come with fresh whipped cream....yum!  I love that this place is classy yet not too stuffy where they do not require a jacket, a NO jeans or NO sandals policy, and even allow me to wear my hat....  Parking sucks, so one is pretty much forced to pay for valet which will leave you some singles foe the bathroom attendant....  Folks, I am taking something close to perfect yet pointing out the items that I take into account.  You will be sure to impress anyone you bring here and if you don't have a budget and care what you spend, enjoy and go nuts.

I love the fact that this place is less than 5 minutes from my house which is also another reason to hate it.  The parking at this place is so bad but it hasnt stopped me from coming and it wont.  It always seems to be busy for the times I have dined here which is by no mistake or chance at all...this is as good as it gets in Old Town...  If you have been to Mastros in North, North Scottsdale and Ocean Club then you will have a fair comparison although it doesnt quite have the best opportunity to people watch in the lounge like Ocean Club.  A bit too dark in terms of lighting in the dining room and if music is playing in the lounge then it is hard to talk over it...same for Ocean Club....the bathrooms are very impressive in terms of attention to detail...  As always, the filets are perfect with bearnaise sauce, any side can feed easily 3 people (lobster or wasabi mashed potatoes), wedge or ceasar salad, and any dessert will please....  Thank you Mark Levy and the Mastro Group....bravo again!!

I am glad the Tommy Bahama brand diversified themselves with having restaurants or maybe the clothing line came after?  Regardless....the clothing line is by all means for individuals well into the 40s+.  Although it's the not the clothing line I am reviewing, but felt it was necessary to share.    From Scottsdale to Maui and now my experience in Las Vegas, I have to say it is a chain that has yet to disappoint.  The service has always been top notch,  the food is fantastic and the prices are on the edge of being overpriced, but the price point works for me.    Portion sizes are usually enough to share so getting a couple apps, an entree which allows drinking during and dessert at the end has been the way I usually do it.  Do not think they are oversized because they are not.  Each entree is sized to be filling....I'm just saying that the appetizers are too good to not order more than one.  Which ones do I recommend?  All of them....seriously.    We were on the patio at night and wasn't crazy about the in ground spot lights that was kind of blinding at times....nice for ambiance, but wasn't a fan at my table.  The bar looked like a good place to come if you are looking to have a spot to attend regularly.  The right size and the right mix of men and women....

Love the W but don't love that this is where I had to eat breakfast when i was there for my stay-cation.  Don't get me wrong, the Eggs Benny are fantastic and the sushi is too, but the pricing is eye-popping-high and the service "yokunai desu!!"  Kind of expect a jacket-required/reservation needed for their Shibuya style high prices but maybe they want to weed out the $ 30k millionaires.  Um, we're not in Tokyo anymore, Toto.  Since there are no other options when dining at the W, I will have to admit, I will probably be back, but not by choice.

The server we had was awful but honestly it didnt matter...we were on the patio on a beautiful, although brisk, AZ Winter night....the patio fireplace was roaring, heat lamps burning, and the low tempo house/r&b was bumpin....the seating was although rather tight but the food was just a complete surprise from how quick it came out, the presentation, perfect portion size, taste, and cost....a must for romantics inside and out.  I am not a Latino/Mexican foody but the scallops, black cod, white bean puree, green beans (forget the mexican term on the menu), and the fried banana were amazing.....we opted to not indulge in the plethora of tequilas on the menu but it was VERY tempting....Ill be back and probably very soon!  Love it!!!

I feel bad to not give Fred's more than 2 stars but can't.  Not impressed by Barney'sand was hoping to be at least impressed by Fred's.  Although it was packed at lunch and we had no choice but to sit at the bar for lunch, the decor and ambiance were well done but the servers were way overdressed and acted as if in a super fine dining establishment....um, its Fred's.  I am not saying I had a bad experience....I didnt....I guess the most disappointing part was simply the hype of it and it really being nothing more than being like the hype of a Krispy Kreme or an In-n-Out burger just taking shape....I think that long term this place will struggle after the "brand new" phase sets in....I could be wrong but why mess with the awful mall crowd to get to the second floor of Barney's for a crammed, overpriced meal that you can get anyhwhere else in Scottsdale for cheaper, tastier, and actually breathe?  Yeah, I know the lifelong and bread NY's will back their Fred's but if I am at Barney's shopping or even wanting to eat near the mall, Fred;s would be my last spot....sorry....again, been there, done that.

Think Fox is trying to put Delux into the ground...good burger (turkey) messy but not something I would seek out on a regular basis....went their for lunch but will need to give it a shot for dinner...2 stars are like most prople's 3....not a bad experience but think like most Phoenicians...we are drawn to new places to dine and if Fox does it (which he does it right) we are going to go....worth the "been there done that"  but thats it.

RIP Sol y Sambra and welcome Iruna to Old Town.  This place is to me what Scottsdale is all about.  Amazing decor, great food (tapas (although it is not very large)), and a patio that is cooled...how "cool" is that?  This is a great place to eat every so often since if you eat there enough, it wont be long before you kind of have eaten everything a few times.  Since the menu is not too different from Sol y, it has not been on the top of my list since I dined so often at Sol y.  If you havent been go...its too bad that the other yelpers who rated this place had a bad time....I have yet to be disappointed.

Went on a Monday and got a kick out of how it used to be the bar/club called Next a number of years ago.  The servers seemed a little too busy because I am sure they were understaffed for that evening.  The servers were happy and the busers/food runners were on top of there game.  It was nice to get a free chopped salad because we got a bottle of wine.  The chopped salad was amazing as always (cowboy ciao original) Since the weather has still been nice out, the patio was packed.  Unfortunately the draft beer lines were not cooled (I experienced this managing a bar....not fun) so no beer on draft was available.  Not a big deal having had the bottle of win.  For dinner we split the scallops and halibut which was fantastic....we should have maybe stayed for dessert but went to Yogurtland. LOL.  The price was right, ambiance was good, food was good, too

If I gave 5 stars to establishments, this would be one of them...I live here. Actually, not as much as some do I notice as much as they probably notice me, but this location is indeed the best for business meetings.  Parking can be tight, so I have heard, but have not had a problem.  The coffee bar is a well oiled machine and I am glad because you can usually count on a line although you wait time is minimal.  The breakfast and lunch items are all awesome although I have yet to eat dinner here...This is my second office and while I am sure I will eat here for dinner....I just have not made it a point to eat here.  The wait staff may come off as cold at times, but they are focused...overall, the staff is sharp, busy-busy, and very accommodating.  The meeting rooms they have for groups or events are perfect for business as well.  Number 15 is my number 1!  Bravo FRC....

This place pretty much will sum up the transformation that has gone on downtown in the last 3-5 years. The amount of seating space is minimal so plan on a wait almost anytime you go.  You may find a seat at the bar but don't count on it.  The patio out back is lovely but the summer heat doesn't make it so appealing, but the most recent time I was there...I didn't mind the heat because the set up is so "clean" that it didn't away from the feel of the place.   The servers wear rock band tshirts but all Pop bands from the 60s onward....I think I remember Beastie Boys, but that's an interesting twist.    The bill comes in some beatnik style book that people sign like its a bead and breakfast "been here" book.   The food is so good but it's heart attack food.  Bacon jam and bacon ice cream which is amazing is obviously not what the healthy Vegans are ordering and it's got a Tapas style serving feel which is may in fact be a Tapas restaurant and I just don't know.    Downtown is coming back.....if it was hip...and Carson Kitchen is the best restaurant down there as far as amazing food and ambiance.  Health wise...no way, but that's why you eat out.  Enjoy!!

Met a couple and their coworker for a business dinner and was truly impressed by the modern, shabby chic,  and somewhat Polynesian feel.  The head chef is German and was automatically in love with the fact that they have Spätzle on the menu.  Not a fan of this by anyone at our table,  it is something that I have grown to love and appreciate.  Although it is just an appetizer, it's worthy I would think of something to have to share....although many other impressive appetizers.  The filet was perfect although they do not have Béarnaise sauce that if its something that one comes accustomed to having with their filets, it may be hard to not sigh deeply in disapproval.  I got over it and by no means a deal breaker....Apparently the Moscow Mules are a hit,  but stuck with their Malbec they offered by the glass.  Meh...good, but I see why it's the one they offer by the glass.  Ultimately this place is something straight out of Scottsdale which is always a plus.  Summer lim is doing its best to be quite the place to live....maybe one day.     Valet is in the back, so make sure you go past it and make the right which is behind Andiron.

A 4 for me is a 5 so there isn't a reason why this hip little spot doesn't deserve 5 stars.  For one, it is located at The Ogden which makes Itsy Bitsy only 30 yards and 9 floors below me.  Proximity is key, so I hope it continues to be an excellent spot to frequent when I am hungry with a social need.  There is quite an attractive all female floor staff which can easily be done, but in combination of good service, personality, and genuine small...They need to retain this crew because they have good vibes and on a Sat night and Sun day, there was a good crowd.    Ramen was good, but its Ramen to me and I still never imagined paying for it in a restaurant...shows how much of a white American I am if its more common then I am aware of.....Garlic Edamame, legit...breathe hours later...not so bueno.  The whisky list looks impressive as far as selection, but was hoping to see a 50-60+ year, but that was just a hope I was expecting to have fulfilled.  What no f'n Isabella's Islay?  Bah!  ;) The cookies n' cream mochi was the best part to me...I need to explore the menu more and I intend to....  Good stuff guys....love the beats and the DJ on Saturday sure created a great atmosphere.....plus a bar that has Amstel Light (Why is this a dying beer of choice?) is always good in my book.    -Cheers!

Excited to see their basement addition.  Totally a different feel as the Old Town Scottsdale one, but the concept is intact.  Love this place!  I will be back...
