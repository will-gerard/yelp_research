Went into the store to grab an energy drink with friends on July 4th around midnight. The cashier thought it was fine to yell at us across the store for looking at a little toy plane and then got another customer to start yelling at us not to steal. No actions on our behalf warranted that kind of treatment. Also, I was there with friends from Church. I have worked in retail for quite some time and I have never encountered such poor customer service. I will never go to an Ampm again.
