I was a patient of Dr. Castro. 7 months into my pregnancy I developed a severe case of pelvic gurdle pain and carpal tunnel in my left hand (diagnosed by another physician) to the point where my bed had become our downstairs couch and  I couldn't even get up to use the restroom unless I used a walker my family wasn't home to help me.  Dr. Castro not once asked me about my symptoms and was already gone out of the room   before I was able to explain it to her and just referred me to a Physical Therapist to diagnose and treat me. I found out from their receptionist that they had only seen two pregnant patients within then past few months. They had me lay on a heating pad the entire time. After the two visits that she partially suggested and two copays later I saw no reason to keep going back there. When the time came for me to submit the paperwork for my short term disability claim to be excused from work with half of my pay Dr. Castro wanted me to come back to the office a little over a week after I had just seen her, even though i explained how painful it is for me to move and come in, I was very upset that I had came in all just so she could tell me she is denying my request and typically women have to take narcotics or get their labor induced if the pain is that severe (great recommendation doc while I'm 27 weeks pregnant) plus she said I haven't really been going to the ER due to the pain. I went once and they explained that due to me being pregnant they couldn't do anything for the pain (understandable, so why would I keep going in and end up in more pain just to go up there for no reason). She felt as if I could still perform my work duties (when I cant even sit in a chair longer then 10 minutes or move my fingers without pain just to type) She denied my paid short term disability claim but approved me for non paid FMLA...??? And pretty much left with the option of "I can take my 12 weeks leave now or after my baby is born"  I've never walked out of a Dr's office before (well barely) but I was so upset, switched physicians that same day. The lack of communication I have received from Dr. Castro is unreal. I believe she may have to many patients idk but she never remembers anything from the visit before or any event that may have happened with me. No notes or anything. I found myself repeating things from two visits ago. I called myself doing research on Dr. Castro before I scheduled with her and it seemed as if she would have been perfect. Boy was I wrong. I have heard that Dr. Pelopida is great. The office staff could use some work as well. They are kind of rude and short with patients as if they are being annoyed by patients.

I thought by looking at the outside that it was going to be one of those restaurants that cook their food with love. I was so wrong.  None of the curries taste like curry. It all taste like chicken and gravy. Very BLAND. After one lunch buffet round we decided to wrap up our visit and the lady at the register wouldn't honor our restaurants.com voucher so we end up paying cash after she snatched my phone out of my hand a threatened to call the police... Her attitude was terrible.  Now we're stuck with vouchers for a place we would NEVER EVER go to again. It's a good place for a ASU student looking for a cheap eat. But you definitely get what you pay for here   Just a heads up they pour everyone's flat sodas from 2 liter bottles and a beer cost more then the buffet.... TERRIBLE FOOD AND SERVICE

Service was ok.... The guy at the register seemed as if he was irritated with me for asking if the bread was a pita or lavash flatbread and if I could substitute tahini sauce for tzatziki sauce. He said you mean garlic sauce and I said no tzatziki. And he wrote garlic sauce on my order and I had to correct him again....  I went for lunch and I ordered chicken shawarma sandwich, tradional baklava because they offer many flavors, and spinach pie.... First off they use cheap ingredients.   Chicken shawarma sandwich was on a pita instead of lavash flatbread, squishy thick tomatoe, chunky iceberg lettuce because it wasn't even diced all the way, and a runny tzatziki sauce. The spinach pie taste as if it was store bought not fresh at all. And my baklava was made with what taste like all peanuts.  Very disappointed. And it was my coworkers first time trying middle eastern food. I'm sure she won't give it a second chance.

It was a dive atmosphere (which I like). I played a round of pool... Wings had too much sauce on them and the tenders are the frozen processed kind. I asked to substitute for the popcorn shrimp and they told me they were out. Long Wongs is way better. I wanted to try this place for the first time. It'll be my last

I have used Camelback Moving Co. quite few times. I must say they are hands down the best in AZ. I have used other companies before and found some of my things dinged up or scratched. But not with these guys. I love how they wrapped everything in a protective wrap and take their time to make sure that everything is has the proper clearance. They also disassembled and reassembled my boys very expensive bunk bed set perfectly.   I've found them to be very accurate with quoted time. They arrive within the time given and they have things moved within the time given. I had a team of 3. They had my 3 bedroom packed and unpacked in 3 hours. I highly recommend Camelback Moving

I went in for an oil change and upon completing the oil change Daniel discovered that my steering bar was missing a bolt. He was kind enough to show me exactly what was going on. I couldn't believe it! He explained how dangerous it was for me to drive with it like that. He then proceeded to go to Ace Hardware to get the missing bolt and kindly charged the part to their account. He went in and fixed it. And guess what I was charged? Absolutely nothing! I will definitely be coming back here for any of my car needs. Everyone was extremely nice Daniel the mechanic and Prem the owner. Thank you guys!
