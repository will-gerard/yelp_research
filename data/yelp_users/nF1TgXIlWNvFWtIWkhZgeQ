Not to be repetitious, but really nice buffet. No one's addressed the regular (non-Sunday) breakfast, but for $9.95 you get juice, coffee and food. Omelets, cheeses, bacon and thick cut applewood smoked if you want, smoked salmon (not little pieces, but a whole slab o' fish you slice off a piece yourself) and all those deserts (pastries, pies, cakes, etc.) including the sorbets. And then there are the non-US selections with Thai, Japanese and other cuisines represented. Fantastic ranges of spices and flavors. And kudoes to the designers for keeping the 'sausage-making' out of view of the diners, making the entire experience more pleasant than most buffets.

I've had a few breakfast meetings here, and really like the location (although not really on Scottsdale Rd, it's on Indian Bend across from the Railroad Park, but easy to find with plenty of parking). Plenty of electrical outlets and wifi make it a good place to work and nibble on the free bread samples and get coffee'd up while waiting. I've been unable to tear myself away from the feta and tomato eggs, I love the way the flavors play off each other. And the bread is great, tastes like someone actually baked it. And there's always more coffee... With Jacqueline's gone, it's my go-to breakfast meeting location in this part of town (or Coffee Roastery...)

It's been two days now, and I still don't understand it.   First, what you want to know. The food is great, service is friendly and accomodating. We had nachos, carne asada and pork shoulder tacos and even cubano sandwiches, all good. Great server too. Kudos.  What I can't understand it... I show up with two other adults and a child. We're told a table won't be ready for 20 minutes (the big one in the middle with a sign on it? I don't know, the website says no reservations and when I called 30min earlier I wasn't asked if I wanted to make one). OK fine, we'll sit at the bar and drink. Three adults, three alcoholic drinks. One kid, one kid drink.   But then, the bartender tells me 'i'd prefer you didn't sit at the bar if you're waiting for a table, people are gonna come in and want to sit at the bar to drink.'   Wha? What am I doing? And the $20 I'm spending here doesn't count? And I'm gonna order food too, they're not! So you want a 4 meals and drinks off your bar just in case someone comes in? She didn't see my point, and she was clearly busy (not making drinks for people at the bar, but for PEOPLE EATING FOOD AT TABLES).  Fortunately, a table came available upstairs and we took our wonderment (and our mojitos with wonderful mint) with us to dinner, which we enjoyed (and even took some home, which we enjoyed again).  I'll be back, even without a Groupon (note, that's why we were there), and maybe even just to sit at the bar for an hour or so, lingering over a single drink, but not eating anything, just like the bartender wants. But I still don't understand it.

Great people and make me feel better. I didn't know. Should have been benefiting for years. Easy to work with, convenient and beneficial.

I have nothing more to add, but I don't want anyone to think 'only a few' people had  complaints about this poorly planned "festival."   Oh, wait, I do.   I was there with my 4 year old grand-daughter (and my daughter), since there were going to be kids attractions as well as the food trucks. I thought it was nuts that 3 minutes of jumping around cost $3. But I guess it was consistent with the $4 water and $7 beers.  And it would help if there was some roadway controls and/or temporary signage. By 11am, traffic backed up (down) Pima from the event to Indian Bend and over towards the 101. Cars were skipping ahead and cutting into line, further delaying entrance.   If success is measured by interest, the festival was a success. If by performance and customer satisfaction, not so much. And how can a vendor commit to showing and not have enough food to feed the presold ticket holders? Why risk your hard-fought reputation?
