My daughter had a gift card purchased an an auction to use here.  When she went to use it they told her their system was "down" and she had to pay for it some other way.  When she told me about it I was really unhappy about the way they handled the situation.  A gift card is not a coupon - it's basically cash and she had to come out of pocket for her item.  When we went to pick her item up I politely inquired about the whole situation.  The girl at the front went to get the manager.  Needless to say, Grayson offered excellent customer service and handled the situation completely to our satisfaction.  We would come back here in a heartbeat and know that if we have a problem they will do their best to fix it!

I am standing here as I write this. I've been here for 40 min already. All because I am using a 50% coupon that they issued. They can't figure out how to use it. So they want me to pay for it completely and have them send me a check.  Seriously? Who does that?  It's not my problem or issue that they can't figure out how to honor their coupons.  It's not a rebate - it's a 50% off coupon! They know the total - just charge me half and figure out your system out on your end and your time!! It's now been 45 min and counting.  By the way while I've been waiting they've lost a customer's $400 Kate Spade sweater, couldn't find another mans order and had some creepy guy hanging out standing in the rocks and peeking in the windows for 10 min while he waits to pick up the front desk girl.  I gave them a chance after they lost one of my sweaters but this is the LAST time I ever use this dry cleaner.

Happy to have found a place outside of LA  for good Vietnamese sandwiches.  Bread is baked on site so it's fresh and tasty.  They are slightly smaller than we are used to, but you can't beat the price.  Only one sandwich is more than $4.  They also have smoothies, iced coffee, and flavored teas.  Sticky rice, puff pastries with meat and other treats round out the menu.

Some of the best coffee and crepes.  Every time we are on this side of town we make it a point to stop in.  Friendly family run business.  While the place itself is small, the ambience and decor is nice.  They even have a separate room for small business meetings and such.  The only bad thing is that there is not one closer to me!
