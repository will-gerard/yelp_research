Having a new puppy requires lots of supplies and lots of cash if you shop at Petsmart. I like Petsmart and will still go there for food and grooming, but our dog trainer told us about Ryan's and my first visit made me a fan.   I was unsure at first and had to ask about the "rules" like no purses allowed- they lock em up in a cage behind the registers and give you a number to retrieve them later. Also there's a $25 minimum so don't go unless you need a few things. And the catalog is king. Prices aren't marked on items only listed in the catalog.  I shopped blind (just got what I wanted without consulting the catalog) and spent a little more than I had anticipated, but it would have been a heckova lot more at any retail pet place. I grabbed a catalog to look through for next time and felt pretty good about my future with Ryan's.

I have been here twice, once alone and once with JD, both times the food and service were both stellar. I love me some noodles, and their Korean Spicy Beef noodles are freaking great! I also really liked their fresh spring rolls, the sauce was perfect plus a little more siracha. But better than all the others I've had elsewhere lately.  The place is really small though, that is my only gripe besides the fact that it shares a bathroom with Tokoyo Express next door. A table of four that was there while I was were basically entertaining the whole place. It was easier to listen than try to talk over them.

The Asian Nacho's are unbelievably amazing! That's the only thing we had, but I would go back just to have them again. They use wanton's as chips and pile on the cheese and fixins. Genious!

I woke up wanting both Mexican and sushi, so what's a girl to do but go to Moto! I remembered their Asian nachos and before stepping foot out of bed visions of them were dancing in my head! I was kind of worried bc I know saturdays they have the all u can eat sushi thing and I've heard it gets packed and service is slow, but the nachos on my brain were too hard to ignore so we pressed on!  It was near-full, but we were seated and had a small chicken nachos in no time! So flippin good I can't even tell you! The sauce is like half BBQ half hot sauce, and it's fantastic! We got an extra side of that and of sriracha (bc sauce, to me, is a must-have).  We decided to go with the a.y.c.e. deal, and I ordered 4 rolls and 2 kinds of nigiri. Our server then turned to my companion and asked what he would like?!?!?!? Huh? I'm not a competitive eater! I had ordered for both of us. She got all bristly, and I told her we knew that each person pays 18.95 for ayce, and we were cool with that, but just ordering together. It was a big deal that needn't be, but whatev's.   I'm not a fan of smoked salmon, but the Vegas roll was still good. Fry anything and it works. The tootsie was our favorite and the spicy yellowtail our least. We couldn't finish our order and didn't order anything else. Our server said she felt bad for charging us both the ayce price when we only ordered one plate, but she had no problem doing it. They must have a lot of losers coming in trying to feed the whole fam at one price I guess. Not so cool for us normal people. I will be back for those damn nachos, but probably won't ever do the ayce again. If you can pack it away-go for it, if not-just stick with what you like and avoid the drama.

I had to pick up my car after it had some minor cosmetic surgery at Scott's Coach Works and decided to stay in the area for awhile. After browsing around Last Chance awhile I decided to grab some lunch before heading home.   Although their premade pizza's looked pretty good, I decided on the lunch size Louie Prima calzone. The wait would be about 20 minutes, so I went next door to Fry's for some quick grocery shopping.   I picked up my lunch and it just about killed me to smell it but not inhale it on the way home. As I finally sat down to eat it I was like a kid at Christmas! Every time I tore into the perfectly browned crust I found another treasure. Sliced tomatos, gobs of spinich and a load of my absolute favorite-ricotta cheese all mixed up with a fair share of mozzarella too! And of course the marinara sauce for dipping.  It was pretty messy to eat, but anything I eat usually ends up being messy and in my book: messy=good. I'm a fan!

I had a pastrami on rye with a salad instead of fries. The sandwich was great-piled with hot pastrami, sauerkraut and thousand island. The salad was exactly as it was billed but better than having fries. I tried some of their homemade horseradish and it was good but not as hot as they make it seem.   My only dislike? The place looked and felt just like a school cafeteria. I'd rather not revisit jr high, but this place at least had better food.

We visited CG recently for my husband's birthday and had a wonderful meal, top notch service and a really great time! The center of the table was dusted with birthday confetti when we arrived which was a nice touch. We started with a chopped salad which was the low point of the meal. It wasnt bad but it wasnt good either. I found myself jealous of the cesar salad that someone else had ordered because it looked much better. However, the rest of the meal was near perfect so let me move along. I decided to order a special- a filet topped with lumb crabmeat and red pepper hollandaise. WOW. It was so tasty! It was also smaller than the regular filet which turned out to be a good thing. We shared the au gratin potatos and the lobster mac and cheese and both were phenomenal! They were both very rich, and the potatoes were especially incredible. Even the sprinkling of crust on top tasted delicious!   For dessert we shared the flourless chocolate cake and the creme brulee. I have honestly never tasted better creme brulee in my life. It was perfect! The cake was good too, and I'm not even a chocolate person. Our server took a picture of us after dinner and printed it for us, which was a very sweet thing to do. Thanks Capital Grill, just give the chopped salad a makeover.

First time at the hut an I'm really impressed with the food! I had the summer roll to start and it blew me away with the flavors and textures it contained. Next came the Mongolian beef (minus the beef!) but it looked and tasted alot like beef. It was scrumptious! I can't wait to come back and try more things! It isnt much to look at inside or out, but they have some great food at good prices. And it's good for you!

I stopped here today for lunch after Pei Wei put me on hold. I was starving and needed food fast- plus I had a taste for something asian.  It seems they have changed their name to Tara Thai? At least thats what the sign seemed to say(?)   I opted for the buffet to go and was impressed by all the different selections- especially of noodles. I have a thing for noodles and tried three different kinds- one of which, called simply Chicken Noodles was AH-mazing! Big thick flat noodles with hunks of chicken and bean sprouts and onions. The Pad Thai noodles were also pretty scrumptious.   The onlly thing I didn't enjoy were the eggrolls. They looked like they were straight from a La Choy freezer box. Instead of homemade and all big and bumpy they were finger sized with that weird dough that is flaky on the outside but retains all the grease inside and tastes like hot dirt. Anyway, not a big deal but I'd figured I'd mention it. Must go back for the noodles.

I seriously love the "Mama's Special" spinich pizza, but sometimes I get carried away and eat way too much of it! Last night we picked up a "Super 6" and ate the whole thing in about 20 minutes it was so good! Their pizza is the absolute best I have ever had. From the scrumptious crust and savory sauce to the tasty toppings that are baked into the incredible cheese I don't know another pizza that makes me so happy!

OMG- their spaghetti and meatball calzone is freakin amazing! I don't know what my obsession with meatballs means, but this thing was incredible! We got a medium and split it and wished there was more after it was gone. Well done!

I always see coupons for this place and today I found it and gave it a try. My first impression walking in was "eh" could be better, could be worse. The service, however- Couldn't get any worse. I've had days when I wanted to be anywhere but work, but this chick behind the counter was so angry/annoyed to be there it was coming off her in waves!   I ordered a spicy chicken burrito that was BLECH!!! Nothing good about that thing. I also ordered a mini steak quesadilla. She made me a full sized instead. This turned out to be a good thing since the burrito was awful. The quesadilla was pretty darn good! Needless to say I wont come near this place ever again.

I love this place! Employees are always friendly and helpful, and the place is always clean and shiny despite all the traffic it gets. I pick up sandwiches on my way to work sometimes that make my coworkers jealous! Great place and great peeps! Thumbs up!

I have used Deer Creek for the past five years and they have always been great to me and my cat and two dogs. Everyone is super friendly and always helpful with any questions or concerns that I have and my animals are always well taken care of.   Recently, Dr K. recommended that I bring my youngest rescue pup to daycare to help socialize her. She is very rambunctious and also untrusting of strangers. Yesterday was her first day and my fiance and I couldnt believe that our dog was so calm when we picked her up- she was plum tuckered out! She will now be going at least once a week. Thanks so much Deer Creek employees for always taking such good care of my babies! Dixie, Healey and Morgan thank you too!

This is my go-to spot for mani-pedi's and brow waxing. They do a bang-up job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good. I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 3-5 minutes to be assigned a nail tech.  They recently got new massage chairs that don't grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do. Also, this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax. My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here. I don't know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do. Oh, and they are typically $5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures!

I stopped in here last week because it is directly across from my dry cleaners. I was having friends over to meet mine and JD's new pup-pup and needed some white wine to serve along with the beers I already had. One of the proprieters was behind the counter and was extremely helpful in picking out just the right bottles for my price range and taste. She told me about the wine tastings that they have as well and that if you go-get there early because they fill up quick. I will definitely hit this place up again for help trying new wines instead of making a random guess at Albertson's.

I haven't been to the horse races since I lived in Arkansas so when a friend mentioned that they were going on New Year's Day we decided to stop by. It was pretty crowded inside and a beautiful sunny day out, so we set up camp around the outdoor tiki bar. It's not very nice or new, but the people are friendly and the drinks are cheap! Its kind of fun to bet and cheer and see who wins. I won like 3 bucks but lost 10-oh well, chalk it up to fun and call it a day. Probably the best thing I saw was a couple of kids- one holding a trash bag and the other going head first into trash cans fishing out bottles and cans! This gives you a little hint about the crowd, no?

I used to love this place a couple of years ago, what happened??? I always got their Bankok Pad Thai Noodles with veggies and added chicken and it was great! Today my boss offerred to buy lunch for everyone and we decided on EB because it's right across the street.  Sadly every single order was either poorly made, over cooked or in my case- completely wrong!   I was looking forward to hot, sticky, carb-y, noodle-y goodness and wound up with some hard, fire-blasted chicken turds on top of a green salad with tomatoes, cucumbers and wonton strips. Someone from EB wrote "thai" on it and that's how I figured out it was mine (since there were no noodles). Very VERY disappointing. Hopefully it was just a really really crappy day for them and an equally crappy lunch for me and my co-workers.

I am so in love with their chicken pho! Its the best I've had so far! I get takeout sometimes because it is right near work. FYI-Picking up to go is really hard on weekends because of the lack of parking due to the movie theater and other businesses.

I like Flo's for lunch. It's fast, it's tasty, and it's a ton of food for a pittance. I skip the wonton strips that come first and dig into the small green salad with the scrumptious ginger dressing.   My favorite dish here is the Yellow Curry Chicken because it has lots of  veggies. It comes with eggplant, broccoli, onions and peppers and tastes divine without being to overly rich. And there is always more than enough for a second meal. All that for just over 8 bucks (drink not included) is a heck of a good lunch deal. Lunch is served until 3pm too, which is nice for people who prefer a later lunch like I do.

Hungry for some pasta, I grabbed my man and my groupon and hit Arrivederci. The wall art was.......interesting?  Some strange looking faux Italian frescoes. Not what I would do, but on to the food:   The rolls with pesto to start were fantastic. Good thing they only gave us one roll apiece or we'd have filled up on those. We split an arugula salad, which had a great vinaigrette dressing.   For dinner,  I had the linguini vogole-shrimp, clams, mussels and calamari with the perfect amount of red sauce and expertly cooked noodles. My other half had the carne cannelloni, which was super rich, but SO tasty! I had more than one bite and was really impressed.   We had no room to do dessert, but we did clean our dinner plates.   Bottom line- super good food, but I can't afford it all the time. Thanks for the experience groupon!

Had lunch with the fam here and we were all super pleased with most everything! We had a seaweed salad, vegas roll(*best!), spicy tuna roll and split two lunch specials. Ma got pork katsu bento box and it finally came out as sis and I were finishing the bowl that I had ordered full of raw fish. We were a bit scared at first, but the shrimp, tuna, yellowtail and salmon were in perfect bite sized pieces over rice and accompanied by tasty vegetables. It was a winner even to sis who claims to hate salmon. The pork was a letdown, but saved by the salad's it was served over and next to. Ixnay the pork and everything was perfecto!

I purchased a groupon for HC just after Christmas and decided to go back. THe one time I had been here before had just been kinda meh, but I LOVE cuban food and wanted to give it a second try.  It was just as I remembered. Blah and bland and pretty boring. We had the plantain chips with black bean dip for an appetizer and it was quite lacking in flavor and temperature. A cold bean dip with hot chips? Weird. Next our entrees- Chicken cubano for me-the chicken was pretty good but the onions on top were kind of sweet and just didnt work for me, a person who adores onions 99.9% of the time.  I had a glass of the red sangria which was probably the best part of the whole meal, rivaled only by the one man band providing the entertainment. I think I'm out from now on.

I really like this place and try to stop in whenever I'm in the area. Food is always good and so is the service. Had the wor wonton soup for the first time and I loved it! It had chicken shrimp and wontons plus cabbage, zucchini and snap peas in a hearty broth. This is my favorite Chinese place around. I only wish I lived closer to it! I also had the lunch special beef and vegetables but got it with chicken instead. Amazing! Just what I had hoped for! Delicious chicken with mushrooms, bok Chou, snap peas and more in a tasty brown sauce. So good I want to come back for dinner!

I used to eat here all the time in college but it had been awhile. THe main reason for not going for a long time were the long lines and wait times each time we tried to go. Now I see WHY the lines are long and WHY people wait in them:    1. the food is amazing. from sweet potato fries with divine aioli to the always alluring Vino Bambino salad to make it your way boll'o'pasta to pizza and pizzookie you cannot go wrong!   2. the portions are huge and make the second meal as good as the first. I'm eating leftovers as I type!   3. the employees. I think its against the rules to have a bad day here. Everyone is super nice and genuinely so.    4. the atmosphere. it's fun. It's different, it's cute and it works. Makes for a good time on a date, with the fam or just hanging out.    I have a new found love for Oregano's and will be waiting in line alot more often in the future.

I like this Sam's. I get my eye exams/contacts/glasses here and some groceries. It's almost always pretty dead and therefore easy to get in and out quickly and easily. They don't have nearly the selection that most Costco do, but I've never waited in line here.

JD and I wanted a super casual place for lunch on Saturday after a workout and he suggested here and it was the perfect spot. The chips and salsa were exceptionally good, or I had just worked up a voracious appetite at the gym, probably some of both.   JD ordered a cheese crisp and I made fun of him by asking if he was on a diet. Then I ate my words when the behemoth greasy cheesy large pizza sized crisp actually came to the table. It was HUGE! A thin crispy tortilla topped with tons of melty fantastic-ness! It was cut in squares like some pizza's too which made it easy to eat. I had the Mexican Flag enchiladas and they were fine, but lackluster in comparison to the giant wheel of melted cheese across the table.   All in all it was a great meal and definitely reversed any good I had just done at the gym, but that's life and I'm fine with it!

This review is solely based on takeout. WINNING takeout! We got a deluxe pan pizza minus black olives and a side of their famous dressing. Both were home runs! I have to buy a bottle or two of that dressing next time. And maybe even try it on a salad!

This is my favorite TJ's in the area! I love the layout of the store, the employees and most importantly- the goods!! They have the best prepackaged salads and wraps if you need a quick lunch and really good lasagna and other pasta' when you just don't feel like cooking. They also carry my absolute favorite pretzel- the pumpernickel variety! Love those!  Besides the food, they have an amazing selection of wine and specialty beers. This is where I come to refill my wine cabinet or prep for party at my house. You can't go wrong, especially with the knowledgable and friendly employees who are always on hand if you have a question. Keep on being amazing TJ's, I'm a fan!!

I finally made it to Mi Patio last Friday after working up an appetite checking out First Friday. The service was impeccable- chips and salsa brought out right away and replenished as often as needed. I am a salsa fanatic so I loved the fact that they refilled my salsa without it even being totally empty- thats amazing!!  We started with a cheese quesadilla, because whats better than melted cheese on a tortilla? And I tried a margarita on the rocks and really liked the taste of it.  Maybe not the strongest thing, but at least it wasn't loaded with sweet n sour mix. Blech!  We had all but decided what to order when we found out the menu had another side to it- so many choices! I went with a combo plate with a chile relleno, cheese enchilada, beef taco and rice n beans. It was a feast! Everything was wonderful, even the rice. I liked that the chile relleno wasn't battered and fried but simply wrapped in a corn tortilla and stuffed with gooey white cheese. JD had the chicken burro because of the reputation it had earned from other Yelpers and he was very happy with his choice. The burrito had moist, flavorful chunks of chicken that tasted incredible.  We were also totally impressed with the prices! This place is cheap and doesn't skimp at all on food, salsa or service! I can't wait to come back!

Not being a big fan of chain restaurants, I wasnt super excited to eat here last night. I was however, starving and craving mexican food and wanting to try somewhere new so we ended up at Manuel's.   OMG I loved it! The salsa's (especially the hot!) the chips, the cheese crisp with green chiles and onions, and most of all: the chilaquiles!! I LOVE chilaquiles so much and had mostly seen them only served at breakfast until I opened up Manuel's menu and there they were, just how I like them! SO good I wouldve licked the dish they were served in if I wasnt so full afterwards!  JD had a rolled quesadilla that was fantastic too and we both needed to be rolled out of there when we finished eating. It was so good though that I'm craving it again today. We will definitely be back!

Pei Wei is semi-fast food, it's not gourmet but it doesn't pretend to be. Its like PF Chang's slightly goofy little brother- its got the same basic ideas and ingredients, but its not as refined. But it doesnt want to be.  That said, I like it when I want something fast to pick up after work that I know will be a good decent meal for the money. Last night I got Blazing noodles with chicken (JD's fav) and some chicken fried rice. For 14 bucks and change we had enough food for an 80's movie food fight even after we were finished eating. Were our taste buds blown away by amazing flavor and pizzaz? Heck no, but we were happily satisfied,  carb loaded and ready to drift off to dreamland with a slight odor of soy sauce in the air.

JD and I got takeout from here last night and when we went in to pick it up the intoxicating aroma's filling the dimly lit little dining  area made my mouth water immediately. I ordered penne all campagna and a side of marinara because it comes with just a light olive oil/white wine sauce and I love pasta with marinara-especially when its cold and rainy outside. It had chicken, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and spinich in it and tasted perfect with the extra sauce.  However, the biggest winner of the evening was the chicken canneloni, which was one of their weekly specials. JD got it and I must admit I was a tad bit jealous. It was two giant tube pasta's literally stuffed to bursting with a ricotta cheese and chicken mixture, covered with mozzarella and drenched in pink sauce. I kept sinking my bread into that pink sauce it was so freakin good! And the canneloni tasted like an italian enchilada. If there had been veggies in it I would have stolen it from JD for sure.   I have often found  spectacular "specials" at Nicks, so I always ask about them when I call in. Whoever answers the phone has always been uber courteous and sweet explaining all the "off the menu" specials, which I really appreciate (and know is a pain in the arse for them). But it is much appreciated on my end! Grazie Nicks!

We were planning on going to Jalepeno Inferno last Friday, but when we arrived it was a madhouse. A man walking out advised me not go there so I convinced my guy to try Jade Palace instead. They were quite busy as well but were able to seat us immediately. We started with hot and sour soup and the bowl for two is huge. It was really tasty, as were the crispy wontons that they bring out with every meal at no charge.  For dinner I had the vegetarian egg foo young and J had szechuan chicken. Both dishes were delicious. They were also very generous and we had a great meal to take home with us. The service was top notch with our drinks being refreshed as soon as they got low without us having to ask. They are very attentive even when they are slammed and to me, that is the mark of a great restaurant. The prices were pretty good, the food was amazing and the service superior. Writing this is making me want to go there for lunch today!

My man and I made last minute reservations at 8pm and got there about 15 till and The place was packed to the gills! I got a glad of wine at the bar and we were seated before I finished it. It's definitely close quarters down there, I could hear what everyone on either side of us ordered. I could have forked something off of a neighbors plate if I had been desperate! It really didn't bother me though. Out waiter was helpful with the menu and helped me find the best scallop choice for me (the one with portabella mushrooms, it was amazing!) And my boyfriend Ha blackened halibut that was incredibly flavored. The food came fast with big salads to start. The only thing not amazing was the veggie side, but who cares about that with so much good stuff to eat! We left there happy, full and so glad we had gone!

I have only been to Durant's a couple of times for drinks and dessert, but it was just such a cool place that now I have to go back for dinner.   The beginning: Even though I know it's commonplace, I still felt weird entering through the kitchen.    The atmosphere: If the cast of Mad Men were on location in Phoenix, they'd totally be at Durant's inhaling scotch.   The lowdown: Our server was professional and helpful-suggesting wines for us as well as dessert options. We went with the strawberry shortcake and received a gynormous plate heaped with enough delectable amazing-ness to feed six people easily! The moist, spongy shortcake was topped with fresh berries, lots of whipped cream and then sprinkled with chocolate flakes. DEEEElicious!     The verdict: Two thumbs up!  To do list: Eat dinner here.

I am in love with Durant's! I went for dinner last night expecting a quiet meal in a near empty place (on a Monday) and got just the opposite. It was like Saturday night at Durant's. All of the tables were filled and people were standing around waiting to fill the ones most recently vacated. We ordered a bottle of wine and perused the menu. I have to say that I love the fact that your entree comes with sides included instead of having to order everything a la carte, that is annoying. I decided on the  scallops and boy was I happy! There were seven scallops, and they were big ones! They were cooked perfectly- so tender and moist and amazing! I didn't want the meal to end. Someone ordered the halibut, which would have been my second choice and it was a great piece of fish! The steaks looked good as well but I only had eyes for fish on this visit. And potatoes. I had a baked but tasted the roasted garlic mashed and would definitely go with the mashed next time. They were incredible!  Everything about Durant's was amazing: the service, ambiance, food, the feeling. Its definitely a one of a kind establishment that we are lucky to have in Phoenix.

I love Last Chance! My close friends know when they can't reach me on my days off it's probably because I am traipsing around in "the basement" or "the chance" as some of them refer to it. Its not clean, organized or easy to get around in, but I have an undying love for it!  I started coming here when I was an undergrad at ASU and ten years later I am still a fan. I think it is the possibility of finding a needle in a haystack that keeps me coming back. I don't come looking for specific things, I just come hoping to find something exciting. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't but I love the thrill of the hunt!  I have found amazing things here and my family does too everytime they are in town. My sister even got her wedding dress here (one of them, she bought about 5 before deciding which to wear, so annoying!)   Anyway, I get the gitters when I haven't been to LC in awhile, so luckily I have some days off coming up and you better believe I'll be chancing!!

I'd heard so many good things about this place and was really expecting a great meal, but it didn't happen. We got there early on a Saturday(5:30)- which was good because the place filled up fast. That was the only thing that happened fast there.   We only got one menu that four of us had to share and after about 20 minutes had our drink orders taken. I had a sangria, which was ok, but tasted mostly like grape kool-aid. We got chips and salsa-which was depleted in 5 minutes between four of us. We asked for more and got it only after we asked again.    Three of us got the chicken enchiladas and we all agreed that they were ok, not quite good, and far from great. JD had the special- a chorizo pizza. It was really salty and greasy but the crust was kind of crispy, surprisingly. We got another round of drinks and ordered sopapillas to go. This took forever! I didn't eat mine, but heard that they were worth the wait later. I seriously doubt it. Not planning a return trip here.

My family wanted sushi again and sapporo was the closest place to the beauty school where my sis was getting beautified, so we went there for lunch/happy hour a little after 3pm.  The whole patio was open and the bar was half full. We sat just inside but close enough to the door to enjoy both. Our server was really good and got me a seaweed salad even though I could not find it on any menu(?)   We got a Vegas roll, big eye tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll and 2 pieces of octopus nigiri that were all great. Our last roll was not so great. The caterpillar we could have lived without. Its only redeeming quality was it's avocado hat!   I liked Ra a little better, but Sapporo had much better service. And way bigger boobs too!ha

Delux is always really good, fresh, and it's a clean place too! I love the beet salad with chicken added. It's delish! My man digs the burgers and we both scarf the sweet potato fries. Love their dipping sauce that comes next to the ketchup, Ah-mazing!

I love Chino Bandito for takeout. I wouldn't want to eat there, but I like taking the blazing tin trough of goodness home to unwrap and savor it! My favorite is the Jade Chicken, alone or as a quesadilla. The jerk chicken is my other go-to selection but the egg fu young is another good option. JD likes the hengrenade chicken, barbequed pork,  the carnitas and the machaca all in quesadillas.  I think the jerk fried rice is delicious and usually try to steal some of JD's since he gets double rice and no beans. I have to go with the black beans, even though their consistency reminds me of hot road tar. They taste kind of sweet. Add some of CB's homemade salsa and its a tantalizing side dish that compliments a really good takeout meal. The cookies arent bad either. Two combo meals with tax adds up to $17.33. Super cheap for the amout of food you get.

I've been so excited to try Fez after all the reviews I have read and finally made it there last night along with JD and his parents. I was immediately impressed with the layout and decor. It was chic and modern without being fussy and overdone. I guess there was a lighting track above our table that was out so it was tough to see the menu but we managed with a little help from JD's mom's pocket light! The table next to us was using their candle.  We made it in time to score some $3 happy hour glasses of house chardonnay which was good! We started with a basket of sweet potato fries, which smelled divine and tasted incredible with the dipping sauce they came with. It was semi-sweet, garlicy and a bit tart at the same time and really complimented the cinnamon-y taste of the fries. The basket was huge too and we didnt come close to finishing them even between the four of us.   For the main course I had the go green pasta with chicken and I was utterly delighted by my choice! It was one of the best pesto sauces I have ever had and came with slices of zucchini, onions, red peppers and eggplant that, in my opinion, really made the dish. I was intrigued by the marinara pasta selection on the menu and how you could make it spicy, but ultimately my love of all things veggie led me to pick the go green.   JD had the fez burger and I had to have a taste. It was really surprisingly yummy (I'm not a burger fan). I loved the fact that you really could taste the pear and it actually worked great with the barbecue sauce, a nice surprise. But my second favorite dish had to be JD's mom's shrimp kisra. It was so amazing! I loved the fresh spinich and tomatoes and the garlic sauce was finger lickin good (sorry to steal your trademark Colonel)! The shrimp was juicy and perfectly cooked also.   The only reason I am not giving Fez five stars is because of the club-like fist pumpin music that played quite loudly. It wasn't terrible, but it would have been an absolutely perfect experience if the volume had been a bit lower and the tempo a tad slower. It was a Sunday night after all. But I'm not going to dwell on it.   We left there with plenty of leftovers (which rarely happens with us) and everything tasted just as great for breakfast (yes breakfast) this morning. Thank you Fez, lets do it again sometime soon!!! Maybe i will just bring some earplugs.

Came here last night for dinner to meet one of JD's buddies new girlfriend. We were the first to arrive and it was packed but smelled awesome. We had a drink at the bar and when everyone else showed up about 10 minutes later the table was ready. JD and I split a small house salad that was plenty big enough for the two of us. I then had a personal pizza with meatballs and ricotta that was fan-freakin-tastic! I won the "best pizza" at the table award according to everyone. I was more than happy to share because the personal pizza was way too big for just me. The other pizza's at the table were good too, but not as good as mine! Im getting hungry just thinking about it!   The service was prompt and friendly and the food came out fast. The only downside was that the women's restroom was broken and you had to go outside to a "free for all" bathroom that was kinda gross. I dont understand people who don't flush. Anyway, that is the sole reason I left off one star. Hopefully the next time I visit that will be amended.

I've never been done wrong at Chelsea's. But I've never been utterly wowed either. The food is consistently good, the service and atmosphere are top notch and it's in a great location, but I can't seem to give them five stars.  I have always gotten their tacos and most recently tried the seared ahi ones that our server said were only on the lunch menu but I could get for dinner. The ahi was perfectly done and tasted great but didn't really jive with the soft taco fixins. Still it was tasty and I ate and liked it. JD had a cheeseburger that he described as "meh, not as good as Delux (his gold standard)".   Maybe my only thing against  Chelsea's is that it has yet to serve me anything so special to make me YEARN to go back again. If someone suggests it for dinner I'm all in, but would I ever be the suggestee? Nope probably not. Perhaps I should try something new the next time I go and I just might fall for Chelsea's a little harder, but for now she's just an acquaintance that I don't talk bad about but neither do I praise.

i dream about this noodle place, but not especially for the noodles. They have the most amazing shrimp fried rice that I have ever encountered. Seriously-AAAAAmazing! Its kind of hard to pick a noodle dish because the descriptions are vague and the servers are very "authentic".  I've been there at least a half dozen times and the shr fr rice is the most amazing dish every time, as well as the hot and sour soup. Those are the best in my book.

I love Z Pizza so much it is almost always our Tuesday night meal plan (because of the buy one pizza get the 2nd for 5$. used to be free but still a great value,). My favorites are the Mexican, the Zbq with the thai being a close third. I have ordered from this location and the one on Hayden and they are both good but this one edges the Hayden one out I think. I want to branch out and try more but I'm so hooked it makes it really tough to change!  We always order 2 mediums and have them for dinner and lunch the following day! So yummy!

This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right. I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it. Good flavor, lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious. I personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup -which is pretty freakin great. There's alot of cheese on top of the soup so lactose intolerants beware!

I love Dick's! I haven't ever had a bad meal here. The blue red and white enchilada's are amazing-especially the one with shrimp, although the chicken is tasty as well. I also like the turkey enchiladas and the green chile pork ones. The garlic plate is divine and easy to share with a group if you like garlic and don't mind tasting it for a day or so afterward. I love the way it smells inside and I love that it is always dark and cozy. Always one of my favorites!

OMG I LOVE DICK'S! Wow that sounds bad, but it's so true! On New Year's day, we went for brunch and it was utterly delicious. I had the Dick's combo: two chicken enchilada's, a jalepeno egg benedict and asparagus with hollandaise sauce ($15). It was all so flipping good! My man swears by the breakfast burrito with chorizo, and his ma got Huevos Ranchero's. Everything looked amazing and smelled so good! I wish I could eat Dick's every day~!! Dick's Hideway of course!

i absolutely love this place! It's always a for sure option for a great deli meal. I am in love with the Matzo ball soup and the Rueben sandwich is also a fave of mine. My friend and I always stay at Encore and make it a point to hit up Zooza. I had the manhattan clam chowder this past weekend and it too was amazing. I'm still the biggest fan of the matzo, but a girl has to branch out a bit!

I work near this Outback and was just introduced to their curbside takeout. On nights I work late and have to pick up dinner this is a snap! PLUS with their 6oz sirloin with two sides for $9.95 who could go wrong?  The steaks are always really good and tender and well seasoned. I usually get a baked potato and salad with fat free tomato dressing and dont feel guilty about anything! My man likes a ceasar with fries, and you can get garlic mashed, sweet potato's or steamed veggies too.   Outback is now on our takeout rotation for being cheap, easy and most importantly- a good meal!

Stopped in for the first time on a Monday night and was surprised at how busy the place was! Found out later that it was a 2 for 1 night and it made sense. We sat at the bar and the service was fine. Only ordered a couple rolls, which were also fine (nothing spectacular or life altering, but not bad). Seemed like a good value compared to other places i have been. I would hit it up again for sure!

My boyfriend and I go here at least once or twice a month, and while its not top notch mexican food, its pretty darn good. The chips and salsa are great-especially the "hot" salsa that they only bring you on request. I even bought hot and regular salsa to bring to a mexican dinner party I was attending once.  I always get the same thing because a. its really good, and b. nothing else can tempt me away from it. Its the shrimp stuffed poblano chilies. It isnt swimming in grease or tons of cheese, the peppers and shrimp have always tasted amazing, AND its served with calabacitas, which I love! The chunks of zuccini with corn, tomatoes, onions just make me smile! My bf really likes their chimichangas and a chicken fundido burrito too.  Another added bonus is the coupon that comes in the mail (the clipper maybe?) that gives you buy one entree get one free. I love it! They also have their fajitas at a discounted price on Thursdays right now!

I still love Valle Luna and usually make it there at least once a month. Their mexican pizza is HUGE and tastes amazing. And it's almost better the morning after re-heated.   It may not be fancy, but they are obviously doing something right- the place is always packed, and I'm a devout fan!

My man took me to Fuego for a pre-birthday meal on a Wednesday night. I was surprised to see how many diners were there a. Because it's a Wednesday and b. Because it's in such an odd spot!! Once you get past the randomness of it's location, you will see how quaint and homey feeling it is. The two servers working the front of the house were friendly multi-taskers who welcomed, advised and fetched drinks while we decided on, then waited for our meal. We started with the scallop app and agreed that it was great, although small (3 scallops/$13). How bout one more tasty morsel? Apparently, it was small to save room for the hulking entrees we graciously received next! Wow! I had the seared ahi-a huge portion of it spicily seasoned, lightly seared, and great tasting! The man had the stuffed chicken breast, and inhaled it. It looked great as well. Also in the "great" category were the side dishes! Omg, the cheddar massed potatoes were so freaking scrumptious I could die! I also had the jalapeño creamed corn, that I mixed with the potatoes to make a combo from heaven! Man got the green chile cornbread casserole, which sounded meh, but tasted incredible! Such a fantastic meal! Stuffed with amazing food, and pampered by attentive servers, I was disappointed that I couldn't give Fuego 5 stars. But it wouldn't be prudent.  Why, you ask?  Because the sangria sucked. I had both the white, that tasted like watered down kool-aid, and the red, that tasted like old, cheap red wine mixed with coke a cola. They both sucked. Not good. Hopefully it was an off night, beverage-wise and I just happened to be there for it. Everything else was spot-on!

I have been here a half dozen times but realized I hadn't written a review after my last visit. I love Tarbell's, plain and simple. The food here is always spot-on and they have some of the best comfort food selections. The spaghetti and meatballs are so good I have had day dreams about them!  Their mac and cheese is smashing as well, we usually get an order of it for the table to share. I recently got the scottish salmon and it was top-notch. For dessert, their creme brulee is amazing- wow!  It is definitely a treat to eat here!!

I have been here a few times for lunch and they have a really great lunch menu with low prices and good food. The service is pretty good and they get you in and out fast, which helps when you are headed back to work. I like the chicken enchiladas, lunch price $6.99 and it comes with your choice of side between fries, black or pinto beans soup or a salad. Not a bad deal!

This is definitely one of my favorite Tj's. I always seem to find stuff here whether it's clearance x-mas stuff BEFORE x-mas, clothes, lotions and shampoo, or most recently- some little valentine thingys for my honey bunch.   Like somebody already said- it is waaaay cleaner than some TJ's I've been in and it's well organized. I always pop in just to see what's there and typically find at least one thing worth dragging home.

I stopped in today famished from a dentist appointment and ordered a Rueben sandwich with pasta salad side and drink. A bit over $9  and a short wait later i was full and happy. The pasta salad wasn't fabulous, but  in my opinion they rarely are anywhere. The sandwich was tasty, warm and the perfect size that didn't make me feel like an Orca but definitely filled me up. The only thing I would have liked to see is condiments out and available because I like my sandwiches wet. Some spicy mustard and hot sauce would have made all the difference. Good place though, and this is from someone who isn't a sandwich girl.

Dr Cooper is the GREATEST!! He is the best dentist I have ever had. My boss recommended him and I will never go anywhere else. He makes you feel so good and even gives hugs sometimes!   I have always been so deathly afraid of dentists but not anymore! His staff is also really great. If you're on the fence about your dentist- RUN to Dr Cooper. He rocks!!

I stopped in for lunch while in the area and fell in love! I'm always searching for great noodle places, and this one fits the bill! I wanted to try everything on the menu, but settled for chicken chow fun noodles and a half order of fresh spring rolls. Both were amazing! I loved that the noodles came packed full of crunchy veggies-My favorite! The broccoli, sprouts, onions and bok choi were phenomenal! Even their iced tea tasted amazing! I only wished I lived closer to this gem!

I visited St Francis the Sunday night the Cardinals beat the Packers right after the game (the valets actually told us of the win!) and we got right in.  We sat at a table/booth in the back which allowed for plenty of people watching, which was great. The decor is really modern and cool. It isn't a huge space but it's comfy feeling. I can't wait to come here when it warms up and the garage door front can be lifted. We ordered a carafe of the house chardonnay and dinner, no apps. The guys both got the burger, which looked amazing and was served with a bowl of nice crispy fries and some of the best ketchup I've had. One person had the Arctic Chard salad and I had the roasted chicken. The salad had a great flavor and so many veggies that I was sorry I didn't order it myself. I personally didnt love the chicken, I'm not a dark meat fan and chicken skin kind of grosses me out.  but the green whipped potatoes were excellent- just wished there had been more of them!  Overall, I think its a great place,I just don't reccommend the chicken for wuss's like myself.

I stopped in for lunch after hearing several good things about Picazzo's. I was impressed with the decor, it was nothing like I had imagined. It was cute and welcoming. I ordered the salad/pasta lunch special and paid the extra buck for a specialty salad. I went with the chopped italian and it was really good. Perfect amount of dressing and all the things you expect on a chopped salad. I paired it with the spaghetti and chicken picatta which was ok. I didn't really taste any picatta flavor, and it was drenched in oil. I actually ended up with some oil on my shirt, which NEVER comes out for me.  All in all it was a good portion of food and it came with a drink and was a pretty good value. I will have to return to try the pizza and other pasta options, but they definitely sold me on the chopped salad!

I have a thing with vegetables, I love them so much! I go crazy here walking down the salad bar line because I love everything. I usually get too much and wind up hurting, but everything is so fresh and tasty it's hard not to. The soup selection is always top notch as well. Its hard to pass up all the great flavors! I took my non-veggie loving boyfriend here and he liked the pizza bread and the mac and cheese! Whatever your preference,  just remember to wear loose fitting pants when you go!

My best friend loves coming here for happy hour/lunch. We used to come all the time until the manager made a snippy comment about us going other places more, so we stopped coming at all for awhile. But last week we went back and it was good. I love the southwest salad with salmon on top. It's a tiny bit spicy and the dressing is just right-not goopy. I love the avocado's and black beans and the red pepper they use to dust the plate. It just works for me, especially with happy hour glasses of pinot grigio! MMmm!

I've had good times and not so good times here, but the good definitely outweighs the bad by far. Last friday I went for happy hour with  a total of 7 friends (one of whom went insanely early in order to save us a table). Arriving at 5:30, I couldn't believe how packed it was! No recession here! I love the music they play- it's just feel-good, trendy pop, but it puts me in to mood to eat, drink and be merry!   I always get the Cowboy roll- which is spicy tuna with cucumbers, spicy sauce and scallions and it just does it for me. For the first time I tried a friend's chimichanga roll and must say that I am now a huge fan! It was even spicier than the cowboy and like a mini party in my mouth! My other fav thing here is the calamari! Its lightly breaded and comes with the best tangy sauce that I always want to keep for later even though I don't know what I would use it for. I'm just a sauce hoarder. And at happy hour an order is only 4 bucks! Beat that? I dont think so. And the specialty rolls are only 8 bucks!  Sushi brokers always treats me well and I leave full, buzzed and happy. Just get there early to get a seat for happy hour!

My boyfriend and I had our first date here a few years ago and decided to go back recently to celebrate his birthday. The sushi was very expensive, but it was good.  We had some salmon sashimi, a spicy shrimp roll and a shiromi lovers roll that had asparagus, crab and halibut. Its was all really good, especially the spicy shrimp. After all this we were still hungry for more and ordered the fire dragon roll- spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, fresh tuna on top sprinkled with cilantro and diced jalapenos- Awesome! Loved it!  It was expensive but it was worth it!

I get all of the Fox RC emails and yesterday received one about a limited time lunch special for $7.50 for 2 of either a side chopped salad, soup of the day or side pasta (lasagna not included) and a drink. A couple of co-workers and I decided to hit it up today and I was pleasantly surprised. Not that I had assumed it was bad or anything- I'd just never been.   I had the turkey and feta salad because it had the most veggies-cucumbers, tomatoes, corn and avocado's and  tender turkey squares. It was really good! So was the pasta- marinara shells with a meatball. It was a perfect amount of food for a great price.

Ma and sis in town and craving Chinese, and me wanting to try something new brought us here for lunch. We started with the lettuce wraps which surprised me by having corn in them! But they were awesome! They give you a ton of filler and perfect lettuce cups, mmmmmm! We all ordered different lunch specials that come with soup or saIad. I got hot and sour soup which was quite tasty and my companions got salad, which was really bland tasting and had chunky lettuce pieces (blech!).   Lunch came and my garlic chicken that I ordered with extra veggies was fantastic! Our server was great with repeatedly having to bring me   more chili paste and keeping our tea's filled. She also "forgot" to charge me for the extra veggies. Ma's chicken chow mein was great as well and sis' beef dish wasn't bad either. All in all- I'd love to go back and try more!

I am one of those people that talk crap about Gordon Biersch behind its back but I'm nice to its face. I go there and continue having expensive yet mediocre meals, but like I just said- I go there. My boyfriend asked me once "why do it to yourself when you don't enjoy it? " I don't know. Maybe I'm a masochistic eater. Actually, I'm just very agreeable and I work super closeby. AND if I didn't go there I would just walk over to Whole foods and spend a zillion dollars on a goulash-y takeout container that I don't even like after I pay for it. For me, lunch is more about getting out and doing something else for an hour a day. If someone wants to go to GB I will happily tag along and probably eat, even though I know I wont like it. At least there's not much harm in that, except to my wallett! PS- Lori is the nicest, sweetest server/bartender ever and chatting with her makes up for the crappy food!

I had driven past here before and wondered about it so after yelping yesterday I decided to pick it up for dinner at home. I got a chicago gyro "as a wrap" and a philly gyro ( just the sandwiches) and baba ghanoush for an appetiser for JD and I to share. We split everything and both thought the chicago gyro/wrap was the best but didnt think it qualified as enough for two, as the menu says. The baba was good but too smooth- I like it better with a courser texture- where you can see and taste the seeds on your tongue! All in all, we decided that we would be back again to try the gyro salad and the chicken gyro's.

I've seen this place on my way to Costco and always wanted to try it. After my amazing facial at Kohler Academy I decided to stop in solo for lunch. It was about 12:30 and the place was pretty crowded. I ordered an ice tea and decided to go for the buffet. Everything looked and smelled delightful so I followed the other diners down the line-o-goodness.   OMG i LOVE this place! From the tomato soup that I started with I knew I was in for a good ride. I pulled a piece of naan into pieces and dropped in into the soup while it cooled off a bit and then dug in and really didnt want it to end! I'm not even that crazy about tomato soup, but this was tops!  Next I got some rice and ladled some chicken curry and chick tikka masala over it. Then I went straight for the palek paneer (?) spinich stuff. After adding mint, tamarind and yogurt sauce on the side, my plate was full. Back at the table I dug in and was so damn happy with everything I couldn't help but smile (love that feeling!!). Both chicken dishes were so tender and flavorful and the spinach was so good that after the first bite I knew I was gonna get more.   Round two I decided to try the veggies. I got more spinach (natch) and also the peas with homemade cheese ( thats what it said on the sign, I dont remember the Indian name) and the chana masala-a garbanzo bean dish. Holy Buddha it was all so incredible that I wished I had someone there to gush to. I could barely finish everything from being so stuffed, but somehow I managed. I guessed to myself how much the check would be- 19, 20 bucks maybe? Try $12.85!!!!!!! I can't wait to bring my bf back here! This is one of my new fav's!!

I love this place! I'm here all the time and I love the sandwiches, pizza, salad bar, hot food bar, butternut squash enchilada's, vegetarian stir fry's, tamale's, and everything that they keep in the deli case. I also love the people who work here. I dont know them by name, nor do they know my name, but we recognize eachother and always speak. I work close by and they ask about work and pack ice on my purchases when it's over 100 degrees and just make me happy for having walked in. Plus I have never left empty handed, it is impossible with all the goodies they offer! I buy wine here, I buy fish, I buy fresh veggies already cut up to eat at work and  their 365 brand water crackers are one of my most craveable items they sell.  Ok, I will stop now. But first- if you take your food to go rather than eat it there you get charged less tax. I sometimes take my salad to go and then sit outside and eat.

I went to Chompie's with a severe craving for matzo ball soup. While I was there I picked up some day old bagels and a turkey sandwich as well. The soup? FRIGGIN AWESOME!!!! My mouth still waters when I think about it. So damn good! The day old mixed bagel bag? AMAZING! Day old? Really? I couldn't tell. Even when they were a few days old in my cupboard they still tasted great.   My reason for the 4 star rating? You guessed it- the turkey sandwich. Now I am not a big sandwich person to begin with, but here was the problem: I ordered a turkey ruben, but was asked what kind of bread, cheese, toppings...??? What? I thought a turkey ruben was a turkey ruben and didnt have choices, so I'm like- "I"ll just have it how it normally is done". Well I ended up with a dry-ass plain turkey sandwich. No ruben to it. I was upset, and I had gotten it to go so there was no going back.   Maybe I wasn't clear or the cashier didnt here the "ruben" part but anyway, it was a botched visit. I plan on hitting them up again soon and trying again- in house this time. Even if I dont get another sandwich, the matzo ball soup is worth a return visit all by itself!

I stopped in here for lunch while killing time between appointments in the area. Its a cute, clean space and the man running the place greeted me warmly and inquired if it was my first visit. I said yes and told him I had seen the place before when in the area and had always wanted to give it a try. It was lunchtime on a Friday and it was busy, but service was top notch.  They had lunch specials that someone at a table near me commented "must be new". I couldn't decide between the kung pao soy chicken and the eggplant dish, but the gentleman taking my order said the Kung pao was a restaurant fave, so I went with that. I'm not a vegetarian, but I sho eat faux meat!- and this was good. It came with a side salad and brown or white rice on the side, and for 8 bucks was a perfectly sized meal. The spice queen in me would have added srircha had it been around, but I didn't ask for it because it really wasn't necessary. There was plenty of sauce that had a little kick to it and being in a "healthy place" helped me reason that the added sodium was unnecessary. (Don't know about you, but i like to pretend I'm a health guru when surrounded by the like. Its my own fun game!)  Bottom line- I really liked this place and asked for a to go menu to take to work bc I will return again for the eggplant!

My first visit to Eddie's house was really an exceptional dining experience. We were seated a one of the oversized wooden four tops overlooking the patio from one side and peering into the kitchen from the opposite. I was facing the kitchen and enjoyed watching the action and seeing all the enticing entrees and apps coming out. It was also cool to see Chef Eddie doing his thing back there and working just as hard as any of his employees. The decor of the place reminded me of a southern country club: dark, rich colors, nice but not pretentious, and comfortable.  We started with two orders of the Mo'rockin shrimp, one per couple because they were so highly touted. After my first bite I was so thankful we had done so. First,they tasted incredible!!! So many flavors in one bite- I could lick the plate and die happy! Second, there are only four shrimp per order and no one deserves only one bite of those delicious little morsels. I questioned the biscuit balls at first glance but after splitting one in half and sopping up the remaining sauce on the plate I understood how tasty and functional they were.   My side of the table split a Caesar  salad that had great dressing but was a tad hard to eat for me because it was not chopped. I made lots of noise chopping it myself, but still managed to make it work. My other half was not pleased with the chopped olives sprinkled on top, but I liked the extra favor acidity they added.   For dinner I had the whole portion of sea bass and it was literally perfect. I can't say I have ever had better. It was served with some gorgeous and just as tasty broccolini. Sharing is a common occurrence among the four diners who were present, so I got to taste a little bit of everyone's! My guy had "what's in my steak",  which looked like a giant edible softball on a plate, but tasted like a big sweet hug from grandma! Comfort food extraordinaire!  It reminded me of something Willy Wonka would make. Crazy looking but scrum-diddily-umptious! The tuna and halibut from "east meets west " were both excellent, and the golden beet slices that accompanied the scallops were delish.   Finally, for dessert the birthday boy in our group chose the "chocolate pot du creme". Holy mother of all that is chocolate! This was amazing!! It looked and tasted like liquid fudge. It was incredibly rich and decadent and perfect to share.   All of this deliciousness, accompanied by two bottles of La Crema Chardonnay,  plus my lovely dining companions equalled a five star review and a lasting memory of a wonderful night.

I've been going to Kohler for over a year now and I love it. I get facials, micro-dermabrasion, haircuts and color regularly and have never been disappointed. (My hair is pretty hard to mess up though!) I took my mom and sister over the Christmas break for facials and they agreed that Kohler students do a great job. You can't beat the prices and they also have great products for sale and a new promotion every month. Whats not to love? Nothing!

I really like Thai House even though I thought it looked pretty sketchy the first time I went there. I got over that quickly after walking in and seeing how clean it was. Also, while we waited for and then ate our food there were three people who came in to pick up takeout (like a sign from God!)   JD and I both loved the Tom Kha Gai soup-so tasty! I had red curry chicken at 3* spicy, which wasn't hardly as spicy as I like it but sometimes I get spice-shy. Anyway- it was good and I added chile paste myself to jazz it up more. The overall flavor was really nice and full. JD had the spicy basil noodles with chicken and they were some awesome noodles! The plate was piled high and he was smart enough to ask for more *'s and didnt have to do as much spice doctoring to his dish.  All in all, I really like this place and grabbed a to-go menu to return the next time I've over this way.

Out shopping yesterday I was tired, hungry and sniffily(sp?) so I decided some Changs Lettuce wraps and Wonton soup were in order for lunch. The first time I called it sounded like somebody hung up. I've cut people off too so no big deal. Called back and sat on hold for what felt like forever until a surly sounding guy took my order and told me 15 minutes. I go there expecting it to be busy and that was why the guy was crabby but it was probably only 1/3 full. I walk in and there is nobody up front, so I go to the bar and wait and 5 minutes-no bartender. I go back up front and find and ask the host about the bartender and she says he'll be back soon so I continue to wait at the bar, no bartender no nobody. Finally the guy comes back and asks me "you have the soup right?" Yeah I did. I reluctantly tipped him a couple bucks and headed home only to find super salty lettuce wrap filling- like buckets of salt on it- and sub-par soup. I just had this soup less than a week ago from the Changs at Kierland and it was awesome. This one had a few scrawny looking shrimp in it where it usually comes with big juicy thick shrimp. And something was off with the broth too, didnt taste right at all. I have loved this soup for years and this was the first time I have been disappointed. Oh well, I will just avoid this location in the future!

I love it every time yelp helps me find an amazing business. It happened again when I came to Valentina's. She is as skilled and helpful as all of her glowing yelp reviews make her out to be. I too am so happy to have found her and will continue to use her from now on. I bought my wedding dress off the rack and the bottom half needed to be taken in quite a bit to fit my hips and she did it absolutely perfectly! Now my dress fits like a glove and I can't wait to wear it later this month! Thanks to yelp for introducing me to Valentina, her tailoring skills are magical!

This place is what Desert Ridge wishes it was! Its great for groceries (Wal-Mart), bargain hunting (TJ Maxx), fast food or dining in (tons of places!), catching a movie (Harkins), stocking up the wine shelf (BevMo), new panties (Vicky's Secret) and a zillion other things. I love that this is close to my house! The only thing that would make it better is a Costco or Sam's Club.

I'm a Fry's fan, but this place annoyed me and made me hot. Maybe it was because I was on my lunch break, pressed for time, and there were 500 women in there just slowly cruisin every aisle like they were killing time. Everywhere I turned was a dead end and the face lotion selection was super limited (my main objective). I had also hoped to score some kind of nice hot lunch while there but aside from some dry looking sandwiches and soup I couldnt find much else.  Sadly, I ended up hitting Jack in the crack on my way back to work. A girl's gotta eat somewhere.

Came here last night, groupon in hand, not knowing what to expect after reading the varying reviews on yelp.I'm happy to say that I was very pleasantly surprised! I loved the pinot grigio that they serve by the glass, and the bruchette appetizer we split was fresh with great flavors. The basket of bread they provided was decent, but would have been a whole lot better warm.  For dinner I had the Frutti del Mare pasta and JD had the chicken parmigiana. Mine was excellent! Tons of clams, muscles, scallops and shrimp sat atop perfectly cooked linguini noodles along with a spot-on marinara sauce. I cleaned my plate! JD was served a GYnormous slab of chicken parm accompanied by linguini with marinara. I had too much on my plate to try his but he assured me it was incredible after polishing it off.   We were stuffed to the gills afterward and couldnt even think about dessert. All in all,  the service was very attentive (there were only 2 other tables there!) and the food was exceptional. I held off on the 5th star because of the strange odor of the place- especially the bathroom. JD thinks the smell is due to the Subway restaurant that is next door and he is probably right. That was the only thing that was kind of off-putting for me. Everything else was great!

I chose to have my birthday dinner at Ocean Prime this year, and what a wonderful dinner it ended up being! We arrived hungry and agreed to start with the colossal shrimp in a tabasco cream sauce.  It was amazing. It came with a few slices of cheezy bread that was perfect for sopping up the sauce. I had the awesome twin lobster tails with asparagus for my entree and my man got the shrimp pasta. We also split the jalapeno scalloped potatoes. Wow. All I can say is that it was the best meal i have had in some time. Our server was great, the food incredible, and the atmosphere upscale but not pretentious at all. And the prices are pretty good. We were also given a complementary dessert for my birthday that we would have never ordered otherwise (too full!) but managed to inhale anyway. The creme brulee was a large portion compared to most places, and was excellent. I'm now looking forward to returning when my mom comes to visit later this month!

We order take out from here all the time because it is consistently flavorful and you get a large amount of food for a relatively low price. One of my favorite things to get is the chicken fettuccine, but I order it with red sauce. Its so good and not as bad for you as white sauce. The chicken is good and there are alot of veggies too. My bf is a serious fan of the Steak Rustica sandwich. Their bread is to DIE for as well. I have liked everything that we have ever ordered. It is on our most visited list for sure. May even get it tonight. You should try it.

We've been here a few times and have never been disappointed by the food. I love the Eggplant and zucchini in black bean sauce with chicken. It is flat out delicious. The pad thai isn't my favorite though. Ordered with a "5" heat factor it was more sweet than hot but my companion didn't seem to mind (although he did agree that my dish was better).  We overheard another patron complain about her food being too hot. This prompted the owner to come around to each table and inquire if anyone else felt their fare was overly spiced. We happily disagreed and said if anything we thought it wasn't hot enough! I liked that the owner checked it out before going back to the complainer and letting her know (politely) that she was the only one in the place that was unhappy. THe only complaint I had was the wait. Someone must have called in sick because there was only one server for the whole place! The bartender was helping out but it all took way too long. I like the place, so I will be back and hope more staff is on when i go.

I've been wanting to try this for awhile and after a saturday evening movie with another couple, finally gave it a try. They were busy, so we had a drink at the bar. The place is small inside but it's inviting. I didn't go outside but it looked alot bigger. Because we had to have popcorn at the movie I was happy to see that you can order the lunch size portions anytime. I had the jambalaya and I really liked it. It was spicy and saucy and the lunch portion was just right. My sweetie go the creole pasta and it was a whole lot heavier than mine but still very good. A friend had the halibut and it looked amazing too.  All in all they have a good selection of food for pretty good prices and the beer and wine selections treated us well. We left there happy people and I, for one, am excited to go back!

I really like this Pita Jungle. I used to frequent the one on Apache while at ASU and to me, this place is 100 x cooler. I like the openness of the space, the decor and that it's usually full of a pretty cool crowd. Whether you go for a quick lunch, a long dinner with lots of friends or just to sit at the bar and watch a game it just works for me.  I also do alot of take out from here and it is the fastest takeout around, usually just 10 minutes, which is how long it takes me to get there from work. One of my fav's is the Spicy Chicken Wrap- a gy-normous behemoth of a wrap with big tender chunks of chicken, beans, brown rice and big hunks of califlour, broccoli, squash, onions and tomatos. Its spicy and I love it, usually adding more siracha and ketchup or salsa. My new favorite is the Chicken Shwarma Lavosh wrap. It comes with a side salad and some kind of garlic sauce on it that is absolutely mouthwatering! The texture of the sauce reminds me of ricotta cheese! I could almost go for it right now, even though its 8am. My bf can't break away from the chicken philly gyro, and I must admit that last night I scrounged some melted swiss off of his takeout foil wrapper. Its that good!  I really havent had anything bad here, even the pad thai special was good (and I doubted it would be). Oh and my favorite starter is the baba ghanoush, but the hummus is great too. I need to get my happy hour companions to give this place a shot, thats the only thing I havent tried yet, but Im sure it is marvelous!

I'm so surprised! I brought my ma, sis and her husband here for lunch on the 23rd because sis loved it last time she was in town. We opted to sit at the high top community table so we had one end all to ourselves. It all looked promising until we were approached by the bitchiest server I have ever run into there. She was snotty to my mother and acted bored as hell to have to wait on us. This isn't what I've become used to at PJ and I hope it was just a bad day and not a sign of things to come!

Back to 5 stars cuz I just love this place! And because I haven't seen the server with a corncob wedged tightly her nether regions the last two times I have been in.  Holly, the bartenders (there are 2!) are both super nice and always friendly. One of them always calls me "hon", which reminds me of Arkansas and I love it!) Anyway- my new fav is the honey ahi salad on their specials menu. The seared ahi is sliced and tastes amazing with the strawberries, mangos and pineapples all covered in the tangy-sweet honey dressing! I can't get enough. I would only love it more if they added avocados. Maybe I will ask next time!

Things I liked: The homemade chips (mmm), the red salsa, the tender chicken pieces in my enchiladas and the service.  Things that just didn't work for me- The green sauce was so blah I couldn't eat it without dousing it in the red to get a little flavor. The beans and rice were disappointing as well. Perhaps it is my lack of familiarity with New Mexican cuisine, but I was not impressed.

I'd wanted to eat here for the longest time and when JD's mom wanted to take us to dinner on Tuesday- this was our destination of choice. Didn't even know that on "taco tuesday" if you order two tacos the third is free- Bonus!! Mom had a grilled halibut and a shrimp taco. JD had the freebie-a steak taco. All three were very well received.   We also had an order of the much heralded guac and it definitely lived up to its hype! It was chunky and perfectly concocted and I was tempted to lick the serving bowl, but refrained in the presence of my *hopefully* future mom-in-law.   I am obSESSed with chilaquiles so natch I ordered that. When asked how I preferred my eggs I said "as hard as possible" to which our server suggested scrambled. I decided to go for it. My plate arrived and it was really good, but admittedly, something was lost from the overall taste of the meal without the fried eggs. I'm glad I tried it and I did clean my plate, but I think fried would have made the dish even better.  JD had the carne asada burrito and was sad when it arrived all beany (he despises beans of any kind and the beans weren't noted on the menu). Our server quickly rushed away the bean filled burro and replaced it with another bean free one. This was amazing- I tasted it. So in the end, everyone was happy!   I love the laid back vibe, the cool location and the super friendly servers. I will be back to have the chilaquiles again with fried eggs. And I wouldn't mind having some tacos as well!

Went here with JD's parents on a Sunday night and at 6pm the parking lot was packed. We dropped the p's off and finally found a spot in the parking area for the Armadillo (I felt bad b/c one of their waiters was outside having a smoke and saw us, but there was so much room there!!) Anyway, the place is cute, nothing fancy, but not trying to be super cool makes it pretty cool to me! I had the beet salad and wished I could have turned it into the chopped salad- looked much better even though I am a beet freak. I had the puttenesca pizza, even though the server didnt highly recommend it (she didnt like shrimp). I loved it! It was spicy and cooked perfectly- not too tough but still crispy.  The bar crowd looked like a fun bunch, so I will most certainly be back again soon!

I went in to get an iPad case and I got more help and  info from other shoppers than I did from the staff. And checking out? A pain in the arse. No one wanted to take my money! Finally one associate told me to see any blue shirt in the front of the store, bc they have handheld scanners, but I couldnt catch any of them! It was ridiculous! Finally a woman I had overheard telling people she was just "directing traffic" noticed how perplexed I was and rang me up. Thankfully so, as I was about to just give up and hit another apple or just shop online.  If you are going to play with all the toys and gadgets, you'll be fine, just be prepared to tackle someone when you're ready to actually buy something!

Groupon lured me in here, and I'm so glad! I'm not that "into" burgers, but my sweetie is, so I couldn't pass up the deal. The place is very clean and cool looking with the brightly painted murals on the wall. I liked that the menu wasn't over crowded with random options but still had something for everyone. We both chose build-your-own grass-fed burgers on onion buns, medium rare with different accoutrements.   Everything turned out great! Burgers were cooked perfectly, just the right amount of toppings applied, and they came out just as we ordered. Plus the servers were on the ball and super friendly. Also great were the sides! I got sweet potato fries but ate more of my dates zucchini fries instead. This worked out bc he ate more of mine than his. I LOVED the zucchini fries SO much, I will go back just for them. A great experience except for one tiny thing. It smelled funny inside! We got used to it eventually, but upon first being seated we both commented on the funny  aroma of the place. Hopefully this is not the norm. I thought it smelled fishy and could be attributed to the salmon patties I saw on the menu, but who knows. I will smell it again next time.

The stupid fries are stupidly good! How can you go wrong with fries topped with chunks of chicken, gravy, cheese, peppers and onions? We came in for a late lunch one saturday and the wait was minimal. I had the Phat Boy. It came with 2 eggs, grits, a biscuit and choice of meat. I had turkey bacon and added a side of gravy for my biscuit. Everything was excellent. Their gravy isnt the typical white gravy I am used to seeing at breakfast but its very tasty and has a kick to it. My other half got some kind of breakfast "samich" and he loved his as well. The only down side to our meal was that we waited a long time for it. Then our waiter forgot our stupid fries and we had to ask for them. When they finally came- AFTER our meal, we were going to send them back but got seduced into "just trying" them, which turned quickly into "eating half" of them. Damn you stupid fries! We left happy, overfull, and ready to start trying to walk off some of the damage we just did.

I have been here three times for breakfast and my boyfriend and I both enjoyed it each time. They have extended their menu since the last time I was there, and seem to serve a little bit of everything, with an emphasis on comfort foods. I am a huge fan of biscuits and gravy, and each time I have gone there we have split an order and I havent been disappointed yet. Once I had a southwestern skillet breakfast that was heavy on the cheese, but really tasty. This last time I had the california benedict, with spinach and avocado that really hit the spot. My man had  some kind of breakfast sandwich on texas toast that looked fantastic. The only thing we can't figure out about this place is why it isnt more enticing to us. The food is good, its close to our house, yet we only go when I find a groupon. Maybe its the cafeteria feel of the place? It kinda reminds me of a hospital cafe. Clean and good but not a very happy place. I dont know why, that is just how it strikes me i guess. But I do recommend their breakfast!

I've wanted to try this place for a long time and finally go around to it this weekend. It was the perfect weather to enjoy on their patio. The patio really makes the place. We sat there and started with the abalone style calamari. I was really good- long strips of calamari flash fried and sitting in an amazing sauce. For dinner I had the butterfish miso-style and it was  pretty good as well. The coleslaw and rice left much to be desired however. My honey had the fish sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was good-the sundried tomato aioli spread really made the sandwich. The fries were good, but not as good as other places and the dipping sauce was just ok.   All in all it was a solid dinner.  I want to go back and try more things. it isn't on my list of favorites but I really think Hula's has great potential. And I would definitely hit it up for happy hour.

The first time I ate here I was only slightly impressed. Was there with JD's parents and we split a ceaser salad that was really good but too small for 4 people. The dressing was divine as were the little chunks of bread mixed into the salad.    For dinner we all got pasta and every dish was good, but not great. I dont know if there was a surplus of calamari that week or what, but all of our seafood-related dishes had a ton of  the mini octopus looking calamari pieces.  I like them, so I didnt mind but JD's mom calls them "matrix guys" and slowly all the "matrix guys" at our table made their way to my plate. Now we always share, and I love tasting things from everyone elses plate, but this was a bit much. I think all the calamari could have ruined my original dish because all I left tasting was matrix guys.  Last Sunday I was less than thrilled to hear that we were going back to TV's, this time not only with JD folks, but my ma as well. I just decided before we got there that I would get a pixzza, because its hard to mess those up. But when I saw the specials list I fell hard for the Seafood Cioppino. And I am so glad I did! It was spectacular! Different from most cioppino's I have had but delicious nontheless. Instead of being brothy, this cioppino was served atop linguini. There was a brothiness to it, but it wasnt a soup. It had all kinds of fish, clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp-even crab legs in it! I die for seafood so I was in heaven! My ma got the halibut and said it was great, JD had some kind of tortelonni that was good, but with only 3 pieces, it looked like it should have been an appetizer. His p's had a pizza and it was really tasty although I only had a bite. I totally changed my mind about this place and look forward to going back.

I stopped in today after a marathon Last Chance run to check the place out and try a salad. I had seen a picture of their anitpasto salad somewhere before and have been dying to try it.   Got the full salad, not half and plus a drink the total was just $10 something. When the salad came out- I did a little happy dance in my seat! It was loaded with all kinds of goodies (which is how I prefer my salads to be). There were cheese tortellini's, marinated mushrooms and peppers, artichoke hearts, mozzarella chunks, ham-provolone-salami twists, olives, tomatoes, red onion- omg I'm getting dizzy-----It was incredible! I chose the balsamic dressing (which was marvelous!) but there were several other kinds to choose from. The only thing that I could think of to add to this salad would be boiled egg slices. I saw that they have them on the menu on other salads, so next time I will request them.  For un-salad-y people, they have pasta, sandwiches, calzones and sasuage wraps as well. Those will go over well when I bring my sweetie to Meatballz. Anyway- I am sooo glad I wandered into Meatballz today because I have found my new favorite salad! Supposedly one is set to open in Desert Ridge soon so I will be anxiously awaiting its arrival!

I heard today that it's on it's way out of the Quarter, but I'm definitely not surprised. It's way over-priced and just not that amazing. Hopefully something better will take it's place.

I am a sucker for promotions, and the last time we ate at MM they gave us a card good for a "special" prize that could only be revealed by our server on our next visit. I think this kind of thing is genius! I carried the magic card in my wallet imagining what my prize would be. Turns out it was a free calzone. Bonus!  We happily order the meatball app, which comes out looking delicious and doesnt disappoint one bit. Three skewers with giant meatballs attached with a slab of mozzarella floating on a hot pond of marinara and sprinkled with parmesan and what seemed like bits of crouton (?). I love me some meatballs and these were definitely not balls to pass up!    For din, I asked to turn my "free cheese calzone" into a chicken one and pay the difference, but our waitress informed me that was not at all possible. I pretty-please asked her if she would just check with the manager on duty for me to see if it could be done. She agreed and of course she came back and said "yeah we can do it". Ok, great. JD ordered a plain pepperoni personal and he was happy with it. Good crust, lots of pep and gooey cheese. My chicken calazone came out looking like two giant cornacopia's of dough, cheese onions, peppers and chicken. It was massive and they had split it in half and just a half was a hulk of a serving. It came with hot marinara sauce on the side for dipping or just pouring over. We were all over that baby and the waitress even commented when we were finished that we did "better than most people" who order their calzones. Was she saying we were cows? Maybe, but I was too full and happy to care.   All in all, it wasn't amazing and I still prefer other places calzones (Spinato's, NYPD Pizza) but if are a calzone lover I'd say give MM a go-round.   *****I didnt see one waitperson's panties this time, major bonus!

I had the absolute best experience ever at Uptown! It's such a cute store and the people are genuinely nice and so helpful. They listen to what you want and guide you in the direction of where it is located in the store. Then you are given cute little  clips to put on dresses you want to try. The spanks slip they loan you is an easy way to feel comfortable in and out of dresses while your salesperson helps out. I liked so many of their dresses I couldn't believe it! They have great styles for us large chested gals who aren't as big on the bottom! I narrowed my search quickly to two, one of which was a bit over my price ceiling. When it was clear the more expensive was my favorite, they gave me the price to buy the sample (25%off) and after a quick consultation with my mother, I was all in!!! I'm so happy with my gown and they let me look it over top to bottom before making a final decision.   Then they said that they will fix little imperfections for no charge (missing beads, Loose strings, etc. So awesome!  I couldn't be happier with my experience at Uptown and Tonia, and I will shout their praises from the rooftops!

I am surprised by the low ratings this place has gotten, because I had a wonderful experience here last night! Granted, it was a first date, so maybe the stars in my eyes had more to do with my companion(?) I really liked the open-ness of the place, the colors and low lighting. The chairs were pretty comfy too! Here's what happened:  Unsure of what our future plans were, we started with the antipasto menu (not available in the bar, I heard). A couple of cheeses, veg's and meats were really fun to share and made for good first date food.  After deciding we were too relaxed and close to the movie we planned to see, we ordered dinner. Holy hell- I cannot say enough about the butternut squash ~pure genious! It combined my absolute faves- butternut squash and ricotta cheese, along with some mushrooms and brussel sprouts (very small pieces-dont be afraid!) It was like dinner and dessert rolled into one. We also tried the spare rib pasta. It was good, but definitely overshadowed by the other main course.   As first dates go, I found out that my companion has a sweet tooth, so bring on dessert-dessert! Our server ferverntly recommended the custard, whichis, as I had previously told my new-date, something that I absolutely adore! It came in a glass overflowing with carmel popcorn! The p-corn had nothn on the custard! OMG! SO great! Terribly rich though. We couldnt finish it. (but after everything else we had, its not a wonder why)  Our server was amazing as well, she provided us with food ideas and always made sure our drinks were filled. She checked in to see that we were happy, but didnt bug us. It was a great experience and I would definitely go again!

My profound love of Mexican cuisine and a bevy of shining Yelp reviews of this place led me here last Saturday night. My BF and I arrived just after 7pm, which was perfect because just after we ordered the place filled up- fast!  The salsa bar is fantastic! Some of my fave's were the peanut, chipotle, strawberry and a chunky dark one who's name escapes me..... But really they were all good.  The very best taco that we tried was the Cochinita Pibil (sp?) It was heavenly- packed with meat that had a kind of smokey, kind of mole/chocolaty taste- it was incredible. All the taco's we had were great though. To start with- the tortillas are so freaking good on their own, and they pack the meat inside of them. I'm getting hungry just thinking about them.  Lastly, my BF is a lifelong connoisseur  of quesadillas, so we ordered a steak one to split. Holy crap- it was a monster! They split it up for us but it looked like we ordered two of them! Humongous! It resembled a strudel pastry! Big, flaky and lightly drizzled with something white, sour cream maybe? I dunno, but it was to die for!  Even the next day when we reheated our leftovers this cheesy doughy meaty concoction was still fantastic! The chicken tinga burrito was almost BETTER the following day! (Maybe because it didnt have to compete with any tacos)!   All in all we were very satisfied and will definitely be back. I would like to wait for a bit cooler weather though, because the place is quite warm inside. That is why I only gave it four stars.

JD and I stopped in for a late lunch on Superbowl Sunday.  The first thing that I noticed and loved was the salsa bar!  I am a salsa fanatic and always ask for a trough of it at every mexican restaurant I visit. How nice to be able to help myself! So we wasted no time ordering chips and a plain cheese quesadilla. I was in salsa heaven! We got every kind they had and mixed up some tasty concoctions. Chips were thin, crispy and great with salsa and our quesadilla was good too (I think it'd be hard to mess one up really)!   I had a chicken soft taco and a cheese and onion enchilada, JD had a chicken burrito. The enchilada was the very best, covered in a spicy red sauce with just enough cheese. My chicken taco was fine but JD's burrito was pretty blah. He said it tasted like mush. I tasted it too and agreed, I think because all you could really taste was rice. There wasn't a whole lot of chicken in it. We agreed that the salsa bar and the enchilada saved the place from failing (in our eyes) and agreed to give it another go in the future.

This place is great for takeout, always open (it seems!) when everything else nearby is not, plus it has a handy little drive thru so you don't have to get your lazy butt out of the car.  It's basically a cousin of the 'berto's chain and has gynormous burrito's. I like to grab some when I don't feel like making breakfast. The sasuage egg n cheese is my fav and JD either gets ham or chorizo.   One late boozy night we had the Super Nacho's and they must have weighed 8 or 10 pounds! Heaped with beans guac, sour cream, cheese and steak- they were awesome but definitely a diet assassin. I'd get em again though!

I heard about Au Reve through Living Social, where I purchased a massage certificate. The day of  my appointment I happily  realized that it was really close to my house. I never know what to expect the first time I get a massage at a new place, but the masseuse was happily waiting for me at the front desk, so I took this as a good sign.   After filling out the requisite questionnaire, we headed for the massage room. It was an adequate space but unfortunately not insulated enough to keep the loud voices in the rest of the salon. It didnt take me long to block out the voices and start relaxing once the massage began. The therapist, I believe her name was Davinia (sp?) listened when I described my problem areas and really gave me a great massage. My most tense areas felt so much better not just after the massage, but days after. One of my favorite things was her use of heated pads on my feet while my body was being massaged and the warm towel placed under my head when I flipped onto my back. These kept me warm and cozy feeling throughout the hour long massage. A really great touch if you ask me!  The therapist offered me the same price I paid through Living Social if I re-booked, and that was a no-brainer on my part. I'm only afraid I put my next appointment out too far because I already want to go back!

I was really happy with my experience at Focal Point. The decor is modern, fun and clean. My stylist Jonathan was as skilled as he was helpful. He found a great solution to my fine, straight, boring hair by giving me layers in front and telling me how to fix them. He also recommended a great product that I really like. My absolute favorite part of my visit was the super relaxing hand and arm massage that they give you while you simultaneously are getting a scalp massage and wash. It was amazing! I cant wait to go back for that alone.

I have always preferred this place to the "big NoRTH" across the way from it. Bar North is open, airy and comfortable and not too noisy, even sitting pseudo inside (even the "inside" is pretty much outdoors when the weather is nice). The menu is the same at both places and BN is less pretentious while still being a nice place to be. It is just so relaxing! The food is good to boot!  Last weekend we stopped in on a "girls night" for wine and apps. We all loved the calamari salad (it sounds just like regular  calamari on the menu, but comes with delicious lemon tossed greens It's a superb combo of light n heavy combined). We also had a pepperoni mushroom pizza that was baked to perfection. They used button mushrooms and I loved that! I even picked them off the pieces we didn't eat because I couldnt leave them behind! The only Thing we weren't crazy about was the asparagus bruchetta. The prosciutto was delish, but the bread and the cheese just didn't work for any of us who tried it. Still, we had a great time, excellent service and some good food and wine. I give them five stars for that!

I came here for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner with the almost in laws. We enjoyed happy hour drinks and appetizers on the patio to start, and what a great start it was! We munched on tater tot-like pom fritos and the sausage plate, which came with assorted pickles, mustard and pretzel bread.  Next we moved into the dining room and our table of choice was next to the fireplace. So cozy! We were all starving so we ordered another appetizer, the shrimp pepper pot. That definitely didn't disappoint! The shrimp was incredible! It reminded us of the mo rockin shrimp from eddies house. Delish! For dinner I tried the pork tenderloin and absolutely loved it! It was perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. My man had chicken enchiladas and those were nice as well. All in all, we were more than satisfied with our evening at el chorro, and will make it a point to return for happy hour and dinner more often!

I'm not a burger girl, but I loved the sweet and spicy burger here. The jalepeno's were incredible, the burger cooked perfectly medium rare and the sweet potato fritters were delicious. I could have eaten a whole order of them on my own, easy! The BF had a peppercorn burger that he raved about and his mom tried the portabello mushroom sandwich (she doesnt eat meat) and liked that as well.   The atmosphere was cool and comfy, great booths and spectacular bar. The service was excellent and the doughnut desert was our most favorite thing of all. The dipping sauce that came with them should be illegal! Its that good! We were embarassed but still wiped the bowl it was served in clean with our fingers. Our server said that most everyone who orders it does the same thing!   ***One tip I'd like to pass along- all of the food comes out HOT! My BF dug in too soon and seared the top of his mouth something awful. (it is cooked in a zillion degree oven or something) lol! Have restraint and let it cool. That kind of pain lingers.

I had to take my car to Scottsdale Lexus for service when Lao Thai caught my eye. I yelped it and reviews convinced me to stop. I usually hit noodles ranch when I'm over this way but wanted to branch out. I'm so happy I did! Absolutely loved my lunch here! I love veggies and chicken and spicy food, so I ordered Tge garden delight with chicken and asked to make it spicy. It was so freaking good I texted my man to make him jealous to ensure my return to this place. I like it HOT and was thrilled to see the four different kinds of chili paste they brought to the table. Some of the best and hottest I have had. I was in heaven! The weekly lunch special comes w soup and eggroll for like $7.95 or something. It was alot of food for few bucks. Can't beat that! I can't wait to return!

I'm a long time fan of Richardson's and after finally visiting the new location I am head over heels again! I love that the new place looks just like the old place inside, except a bit bigger it seems. I love the food and the specials are amazing. I recently tried a green chile tilapia that was incredible! I have family in town soon and already know we are going to Richardson's for a meal.

I love this place so much! If you are an oatmeal fan you can't pass up the oatmeal cookie yogurt at yogurtology! Its so amazing! With bits of real oatmeal mixed in- its incredible. The tart is also supererb and the cheesecake is my 3rd runner up.The prices are really good here too compared to many other yogurt places around.  Being situated a couple doors down from my sisters closet in the town and country center, this place is golden in my book!

After a sweltering day at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival last Sunday, it was time to relax, cool down and actually eat something. We tried The Vig Uptown.   It was around 3ish and we had our choice of seating so we picked a table outside along the bocce court. It was so cool, breezy and open that I loved it immediately. The giant glass windows in the back  give the outside a real modern, open feel while the inside/bar area is more dark, cozy and den-like. Both nice places to hang.  We were famished and started with the palate pleasing artichoke and crab dip. It is served with these perfectly seasoned crackery triangles that are awesome all by themselves but dynamite paired with the creamy dip. We also tried the "hot vings" appetizer  which were covered in a sweet and spicy sauce that was very well received at our table.   Being a Sunday, we were able to take advantage of half price bottle day and split a bottle of chardonnay with our lunch/dinner= linner? I had the salmon with asparagus which was really good except for the sweet corn cake that came with it. That managed to be both hard and gummy and tried its best to spend the rest of the meal plastered on the back of my throat. The salmon was perfect and so was the asparagus, I just wish there had been more of it.   I tasted the steak sandwich which was pretty good but if you don't like onions you will abhor it because its loaded with grilled ones. The standout on the plate was definitely the sweet potato fry dipping sauce. It was a dirty yellow and red flecked curry flavored sauce that was great on everything! Next time I"m there I will order a side no matter what I"m eating.  I also tasted the grilled veggie sandwich and found it incredibly  hearty full of flavor! And it also benefited from the curry sauce.   After all of this good food and wine I was sooo ready for a nap. The Vig Uptown was impressive and I know that I will be back again soon.

This place has become one of our "go-to" spots for great food, service and atmosphere. I have yet to find a displeasing entree or appetizer. Some of my faves include the pad thai, cuban ruben, vigan, salmon, and the pork salad. You really can't go wrong at The Vig Uptown!

JD and I stooped by during happy hour before a movie and gave this place a try. All but one of the apps are half price during happy hour (ahi skewers are still full price) and we went with the nacho's and an order of sliders.   With both we had our choice of meat. On the nacho's we went with chicken and the sliders (three per order) we ordered one pork and two jalepeno sausage. JD liked the jap sasuage but I thought it was pretty gaggy. The pork was good though, with their bbq sauce.  The nacho's were pretty amazing. First of all they are HUGE, have alot of meat, cheese, jalepeno's and onions. The are served with a side of salsa, sour cream, guac and black bean dip. We asked for more salsa because we are fiends and our awesome waiter brought us a soup cup full! It was perfect.   Looking around at other tables I made a vow to myself to return for a sandwich and mashed potatoes. An open-faced beauty on one person's plate is still stuck in my head four days later. I'm glad we finally got a bbq place in this area. I can't wait to come back!

Ok, I came here Sat night to celebrate a pal's birthday. It was a cheesefest from the very beginning. They checked our id's, took our $10 cover and told us we'd better table-up now, bc Common was going to be here later. Really? Woozer! Is that why nobody is even here yet?? It's after 10 and it's basically all my bday party attendees and a few chubby gogo dancers! The birthday girls guy had secured a great table upstairs right off the second floor outdoor bar, so we were all taken care of. It just seemed funny to me that so many guys were there in suits, i mean seriously?  Anyway, the music was pretty good, but after a couple of hours I'd had enough. AND- the valet offered us parking up front for a higher price, and ours was the only car upfront. Enough said I think.

I'd say a solid 4 stars fits well for this joint. Walking in I felt like I was at a ritzy ski chalet in Aspen. Tons of  nice wood and a slight smoky smell made me feel special just to be there. I was instantly impressed. We ordered the green chili pork stew and scallop risotto to start and both were amazing. Scallops were perfecto, especially with the Cakebread Chard that we uncorked! I tried the pork stew sans tortilla and enjoyed that as well.  For din din, I ordered the halibut and was really really disappointed that it was overcooked and dry. Another diner in our group had the same problem and we were both quite sad. However, the spinach flan that accompanied the fish was delicate and moist and mixed well with the towel-dryness of the main player on the plate. I was hesitant to try the "smelly old fish from last week", but someone ordered it and shared and it was super duper tasty. It was drenched in sauce, unlike the rehabbing fish I was introduced to.......... Dessert was great- I don't really remember it after the second bottle of Cakebread, but I know that I ate it! :) All in all a good night, despite the halibut.

This place has a terrible setup! You walk in and the counter is all the way at the back so you walk past the yogurt machines and everyone standing around them to retrieve sample cups. Then back through the crowd to the front where the fat and calories are listed for each flavor (why not post it on the corresponding machines instead?) Dodge other customers as you try to decide what to get. Get leaked on by every machine you get a sample from and finally get to the counter to pay. Prices are good, but this place is in desperate need if a fung shui makeover! I left annoyed.

Lunch specials rock at this place! The gyro was bigger than what I'm used to, and for $6.99 it comes with fries or a side salad. Ive also had the moussaka, which was great, even though it was crazy rich. It came with green beans doused in a great tasting marinara. At first look this looked scary, but tasted amazing! I didn't have dessert, but a friend had the baklava $5.50 and said it was terrific, albeit over priced. I can't wait  to go back and try more dishes!

I returned here for lunch with a friend the other day and had a really good meal. It was a good amount of food for a small price. I had the lunch gyro with a greek salad on the side. You can get fries if you want. The gyro was big and the meat had great flavor. The salad was good too, it had dill in it and I liked that.  I'm not sure why I waited so long to come back, but I won't wait again. The manager or owner, Petros, came over and talked to us and also gave us both free chocolate mousse desserts! That was so nice and really yummy too!

Since moving nearby two months ago, this has become my go-to grub spot. I've yet to order something I haven't loved and despite eating here several times a week- I don't get tired of it. The place is always clean and or being cleaned, the prices are great, the food is awesome and there is barely any wait to get your food. Its a great place to stop for a snack or a meal anytime. Plus they have amazing breakfast burritos and quesadilla's that are served 24 hours.  Since becoming a patron, I have enjoyed the following items the most: bombero chicken burrito, chicken taco's, pastor burrito, pastor torta, chicken nachos, chilaquiles with red sauce, breakfast quesadilla and burrito with chorizo and green chile pork burrito. They have great red and green salsa in bottles so you are free to use as much or little as you need. They serve alcohol as well, if you prefer your tacos with  beer or wine. Overall, it's a great place with good food that you should definitely check out.

I stopped in one afternoon and ordered some baba and a chicken salad. The baba was good, and served with a ton of pita quarters. The salad was good too, except that most of the chicken was burnt.  The cashier was pleasant and must be related to the guys doing the cooking. They were giving her a hard time about a male customer who I guessed must come in a lot and she was giving it right back to them! Kinda funny. I will definitely be back for takeout and lunch again while shopping. I will go for the gyro salad next time though.

I stopped in today on a whim after a Trader Joe's visit. I was impressed by how clean and organized it was inside! Maybe all the construction that had been going on had me associating it with dirt, but there was none to be found!   Due to a lunch hour time crunch, I automatically opted for the daily special- a Boracho Burrito and large drink. For 8 bucks I was impressed by the quality:  The chips were standard issue corn and the salsa was in a little squirt bottle that the cashier got out of a fridge behind the counter. It was blended instead of chunky-which I find muy bueno.  There were good sized chunks of tender beef in the burrito, a ton of cheese on top, extra sauce all over and generous dollops of guac and sour cream on the side. Definitely a solid, inexpensive meal. I will hit it up again for sure.   *For some reason it got me thinking about one of my fave college days hangouts- Two Peso's! Except they dont have a guy yelling "Two-FEEFTY-four, nomber twoFEEFTYfour" when your order is up. Loved that. **That was totally irrelevant, but it felt good.

We really enjoyed our meal at Fuego tacos. So much so that I can't wait to go back. Its a really cute little space in the Esplanade with very nice employees and excellent quesadilla's, taco's and burrito's. I only wish they had a more extensive menu. If they add enchilada's I would love it. The best meat I have had thus far is their pork, and I'm not even a pork person. It reall is that amazing. Check it out and see for yourself!

I bought a groupon for this place because I LOVE mexican food and it was a great deal. We sat on the patio because the weather was so nice. I had a sangria that was just ok. I liked the blue corn chips, but many of them were gross and rubbery due to the amount of  grease. The red salsa was by far the best. We went for the queso asado app and freakin loved it. It was a block of cheese the size of a deck of cards, grilled and topped with what our server said was cactus, but tasted like mild chiles. It came with warm tortillas and was fantastic!  For the main course I had chicken enchiladas and my man tried the buffalo ones. Both were pretty darn good. And beans and rice weren't necessary because the enchiladas were stacked, not rolled and it was a good sized portion. I did order a side of veggies and basically dumped them on top of my enchiladas. Corn, zucchini, squash and tomatoes- they really added to my enjoyment of my dish!   We were stuffed and couldn't do dessert, but I know we'll be back so I'll get to that next time.

Well, I've been wanting to try this place for quite awhile, since I work nearby. Finally I stopped in for lunch yesterday. I have never had Korean food before, but decided to try something totally new to me. Unfortunately, I wasnt a fan. Not because it was done wrong or anything, it just wasnt my taste. I had the Bi Bim Bab and didnt know the egg would have a runny yolk (one of my most despised things in the universe!!!) My co-worker ordered the chicken terryaki bento box and I was totally jealous. The chicken was really good, and it came with salad, soup, california rolls and potstickers for only $6.95!  I'm totally getting that next time. Even though I didnt love my entree, I did like the place and the staff and will definitely be back for sushi and other menu offerings. Its fast, friendly, cheap and clean, and in a great location too!

Made it back in for sushi over the weekend and it was good! The only thing I didn't like was the "crab mix". It comes in a lot of the rolls and I just wasn't partial to it. I did really like the spicy tuna and the spicy crunch rolls. The summer Vegas was good too, but minus the crab on top.  We missed happy hour pricing, but it was still a gret value at regular price! We left full and happy!

Came in here Friday night with a friend just to check the place out and I was impressed. It feels warm and comfortable inside, like you wanna get the gang together and stay awhile.  The girls at the front were super helpful in finding us a seat, although we ended up at the bar in the back. We ordered some edamame, steamed mussels and tempura shrimp. All three were great, but the dipping sauce for the shrimp was too sweet. We used the same sauce that came with the edamame for the shrimp. We met Frank, one of the owners who was a complete gentleman, and some of his friends also seated at the bar. Nice people, no wonder they are involved in this place.  Like most places in this area, you see all kinds of people there and all kinds of outfits! People watching alone is worth a visit. But I will also go back for some of the dishes I saw being served. Everything looked great!

I can't recommend Jacqueline Hanna Photography enough. She is an amazing person who does incredible work. She has a great personality and is so good with kids that both my husband and I were really impressed. And then we got our proofs back and were just blown away. Not only is she likable and easy to work with but she is an excellent photographer! I put off a family portrait for almost two years because I was dreading the process but now I can't wait to book another session! Thanks so much Jacqueline!!!!

A living social coupon brought me in here this past weekend, but the food will definitely bring me back again. Our coupon was for the sushi menu only, so we got some miso soup and a seaweed salad to start. Miso always tastes the same to me, and this was no different. The salad had a nice flavor and had . But what really impressed us were the two specialty rolls we ordered, the Arizona and the Sunshine. Both were excellent! We were really surprised and pleased that they were so good!  It had been a long and arduous day for the both of us, so we didnt stop with the sushi. We went on to split an order of Mongolian beef. We actually ordered everything at once, so it sounded like a good idea, but ended up being a ton of food. The beef dish was excellent, despite how full we were by the time it arrived. There was just enough spice to the really great sauce.   The thing I didnt like was the decor. We sat at a patio table that was inside and there was a television directly above my head that was quite distracting. The food and the service made up for it in my opinion. I plan on adding Iron Chef to our rotation of dinner and/or take out spots. I even grabbed a to go menu on the way out!

My man loves cheeseburgers. We decided to give this place a go after hearing about it from a co worker. We met another couple and deliberated at our table about what to order. We got split up in the ordering line and because the people who got between us were really slow to order, we got our food as our friends were finishing theirs. That's annoying! They need a better system. The ice machine was out of order but a nice guy got us cups of ice for our drinks. Watching our friends eat was torturous, especially because they offered no insight to the taste of their meals. I ordered a chicken sandwich but the other 3 in our party had cheeseburgers. We finally got our appetiser (2 pretzels so we could share with the other couple, you can just get one if you want) and our sandwiches at the same time. My chicken sandwich was monsterous! Two chicken breasts plus all the junk I had added: lettuce, tomato, pickles, grilled onions, avocado and terriyaki sauce! I ended up taking both chickens off and just eating the buns with all my additions and took the chicken home. It was a tasty sandwich all around. The other 3 cheeseburger eaters agreed that their burgers were solidly good. However, we were all equally turned off by the amount of salt on all of the sides. Our pretzels? Twisted salt licks that came with a nacho cheese dipping sauce. We couldnt eat them even after I tried wiping the salt off. Around the table we had onion rings, fries, tater tots and sweet potato fries and every single batch was over salted. By ALOT. I love onion rings but couldnt stomach more than three and I couldnt give them away. It was really bad. When I reported this to the co worker who told me about this place he said he'd heard the same thing from other people. Hopefully they get the message and do something about it. If not they may not be there for long. I would not go back, but my man wants to just to try their build your own mac and cheese, his other love.

I was so underwhelmed by Chick Rotisserie that I do not care to ever return. I went as part of a party of 5 last night and we all wished we had just gone to the Grind instead. If this place makes it, it will be a miracle.  What is good: Its a really cute space with a nice bar. I was excited when we walked in. They have wine, and lots of it. The mashed potatoes and your choice of 3 toppings for them. I love potatoes!  What is not: The menu is bulky and heavy and requires flipping back and forth between pages. It is also super confusing!  The chicken is all on the bone. The sauce you pick is not for dipping, its just what your chicken is cooked in.  The "chicken and dumplings" on the menu is apparently a typo?? Seriously? Our server said they could "probably make me something like C& D". Gee, that sounds awesome.  The one fish selection is served bone in skin on. In a dark restaurant this was really fun for my MIL. Who makes their patrons pay and WORK for their food?? Chick does. They dont have fries to go with their sandwiches. How many guys do you think want to order a side salad with their sandwich? None of ours did. The bacon on their cobb salad is like eating bacon flavored rocks. Hard bacon flavored rocks.  You cannot get un-fried garbanzo beans on the cobb salad, even if you ask for them. The cobb salad is a sad interpretation of a cobb salad, even if you add chicken. Want a hot sandwich? good luck. The unisex bathroom floor was covered in sticky pee footprints. There are two bathrooms, why not make one for each sex and not make me look at or dance around a urinal?  This place was an utter disappointment to our entire party, And it wasnt a cheap disappointment. I'm just glad its over.

This location has been so many different restaurants in the past few years and now there is finally a good one! It's basically a fancied-up paradise bakery with better food, bread, and condiments. Oh and better prices too. I had a small Chipotle Chicken salad and a small tortilla soup and that was a good amount of food- with a drink, for only $10.58. The soup was great! And they let me sample several kinds before making my decision. I also loved that they had at least a dozen different kinds of hot sauce bottles on the wall that customers are free to use as they please. I tried three because I like to bring the heat and because they were available.    My only complaint was that the dirty dish bin was overflowing even though the place was super slow. Can't someone handle that? Its gross to have to move other people's dirty dishes around in order to fit yours in there. Ts seems like an easy thing to fix- someone pick up dirty dishes every couple of hours or something.

Absolutely amazing! This place rocks!!! I love getting the 3 little pigs- 3 different sliders: brisket, pork and beef. That way I get a little bit of everything. All their different barbecue sauces are incredible too. I especially like the habanero, North Carolina and the xxx varieties. And the shoestring fries? They are so additive! The service is top notch and drink refills are always prompt. This is the beat BBQ I've had in a long time and who'd have guessed I'd find it in a gas station??

Tony is one of the kindest people I have met and a wonder with animals. He is so good with my behavior-challenged dog that I boarded her with him when I had family in town. With Tony's help my fiance and I are no longer afraid to take her out in public because she is not barking incessantly at strangers.  If your dog needs help, call Tony. He is extremely dedicated to his work and really good with animals. He also works with us to teach us how we can continue to help our dog progress. When we first contacted him I was having second thoughts about keeping our troublesome second pup and thanks to him we are still a two dog family!

I love this place! Yesterday I brought my scared little dog to their doggy day camp and she loved it! Instead of being full of energy and ready to play for hours after my long day at work, she was all tuckered out!  Apparently after horsing around all day with her new boyfriends Jake and Monte. (she didnt tell me this, it was on her report card I recieved when I picked her up!)   I could tell it was a successful day when, as we walked out of the store, her tail was wagging and her head was held high. (When I dropped her off this morning it was exactly the opposite). The staff was great and even gave me a full report on her progress when I called to check in around mid- afternoon. I also found that if you want salon services the will take them to the grooming area after or during supervised play and then put them in their "room" until you pick them up! I love it! I will most certainly be back to this store for supplies, toys and best of all doggy day camp!

I used to love this place when it was Park Central, but now it is no bueno. It's a huge happy hour hot spot for cool people, but the food is mediocre at best. For example- we ordered chicken and steak tacos on happy hour and all we got were tortillas with meat and cilantro. Really? Gordon bierch serves better tacos than this place. Overpriced and overhyped in my opinion.

Love this place! Their happy hour is until 8pm. We had chicken nachos for an app, I had a turkey rueben with a side salad w black pepper vinaigrette and my guy had spicy chicken and waffles. Everything was amazing including the service. We got refilled drinks by the dozen and were constantly checked on. It was so good we already know what we want to order next time! A friend went to the one in old town and raved about the breakfast nachos- they come with a side of sausage gravy!! I can't say enough about my excitement of returning to dd!

I keep coming back here are keep getting excellent service and terrifically tasty food so what can I say besides IM A FAN! The chorizo Mac n cheese made me want to lick the bowl after we finished an appetizer portion of it. I kind of did, but in a classy way- with my finger! ;) it's that good! The turkey burger was the best I have had in a long time. The pretzel bun is incredible! I finally had breakfast there and it was to die for! Breakfast nachos and a peanut and jelly waffle with syrup and bananas? Yes please! It was a bit much, but we had to do it! There were so many other things on the breakfast menu that I wanted it was hard to decide. I wouldn't do the nachos again by myself, but would definitely split them with others. I want to try some of the mouthwatering omlette's next time. Too many good choices here, they have me hooked.

This place is what chipotle would like to grow up to be. Everything isvfresh, fast and however you want it. I love that they will put anything on anything that you want! I like some enchilada sauce on my nachos thank you, and they put it on for me! Getting a salad but don't want the big hunks of lettuce they use? Ask for the shredded lettuce, you'll get it. I like that you can customize your order because I'm a custom orderer. The prices are great for the huge amount of food you get and the staff is always pleasant. It dies get loud inside but that's because it's a  popular, casual place. I wouldn't change a thing.

I love so much about CB, from the open, airy, Italian cafe atmosphere, to the amazing food and service. But I recently found another thing to love: CB Weekend brunch. Holy moly is it amazing! I visited on a Saturday around noon with my in-laws and we were all blown away. I had the crab Benedict and I was in love from my first glance. There was a really good amount of sumptuous lump crap meat and asparagus chunks topped with the perfect egg and hollandaise. It was amazing beyond words. I didn't have the only first rate dish either! My FIL had CB's rendition of Chicken and Waffles and I must admit, as much as I was loving my dish, I had a twinge of diners envy. It looked Freaking Scrumptious!!! My MIL had the veggie omelette, and it was stellar as well. CB IS serious about its food. I have been for dinner as well and have never seen or heard of anything mediocre or ok- their stuff is GOOD!! Dinner selections that rock are the ravioli of the day, everyday I have love love loved their offerings. The chicken parm is a whole lotta awesome food for one dish. You will definitely be taking home leftovers. I'm also a fan of the clam linguine. It has chorizo, which I never would have thought to add, but it was superb. Last shout out goes to the drunken bread app- if I could have it everyday and not gain a zillion pounds I would without a doubt! CB is a really cool, tasty place that you should put on your "to do" list ASAP!

I really like eating here. It's clean, cheap, tasty and they have sriracha on hand, whats not to like?? i especially love the pasta with spicy marinara and grilled chicken. I add so many veggies and then have them top it off with green pesto. Then I douse it with more hot sauce from their condiment area and, voila! Perfect lunch under 10$.
