I did not stay here but went to visit out of town friends who stayed here.  The hotel was definitely not designed for anyone with any type of mobility issue - steps everywhere!  Steps to get ice.  Steps to get to the pool area.  Steps to get to the lobby.  Can you find a way around some of these steps?  Sure - if you don't mind going into the parking lot and circling around the building while cars drive past you.  The rooms seem nice but there is no way on earth I will EVER stay here.  This hotel doesn't seem to have any concern for the disabled whatsoever.

The good:  very easy to order online, quick delivery and the parmesan bread bites are awesome. The bad:  Regular pizzas tend to be a bit on the greasy side and the crust can be a bit too mushy for my taste. The ok:  The new Artisan pizzas have a nice crunchy crust (which I like), but they seem kind of skimpy on toppings.    All in all, if you are mainly looking for a convenient way to get dinner to the table Dominos will work for you.  If you are mainly looking for fabulous tasting pizza, Dominos may not be the best choice.

I've been to this particular Macaroni Grill several times and enjoyed it and likely after any of those times I would have given it four stars rather than two.  I am, however, rating the restaurant on the last visit and that score is a generous two.  We were seated and told that the hostess had no idea who our waiter/waitress would be.  They were "fighting over tables" so we were wished good luck.  Turns out the hostess became our waitress and seriously she should have just stayed a hostess.  She was incredibly slow (there were only four tables filled and several waiters/waitresses, so I'm not sure what the holdup was) and at one point completely forgot that I had ordered a glass of wine even though she'd gone over to the bar right after I placed the order.  The food was decent, though nothing I'd write home about.  The only description I can give about the Penne Rustica was "cheesy".  Nothing really beyond that sticks out.  My husband found what looked to be a hair in his Carmela's Chicken and that pretty much did it for him.  Then when the bill came the waitress disappeared again and my credit card sat waiting for her to come back for about 15 minutes.  Finally, the manager took the bill and handled it.  The waitress never returned to our table.  Will I go back?  I don't know.  I have always enjoyed Macaroni Grill but the service and food, at least at the Goodyear location have kind of gone down hill.

I love the Wildlife World Zoo & Aquarium.  Seriously it is one of the best zoos I have ever been to and is leagues better than the Phoenix Zoo.  The animals are well tended and plentiful.  The aquarium is new and they get more exhibits every time I go there.  There are feedings where you (and your kids, or kid-like spouse) can feed birds, or watch as the penguins are fed.  There is a platform where you can feed the giraffes and you are about head height with the giraffes so they can just lick the food out of your hand.  There is a water ride, a sky ride and a carousel as well as a small playground.  While the admission seems a bit steep, I know that it goes to caring for the animals here.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this zoo to anyone.  It's fabulous.

We've been going to Fry's since they opened in Arizona.  First to the one in Tempe and then to the one on Thunderbird.  Personally, I prefer the Thunderbird store to the one on Baseline, but that's just my personal preference.  Today we went to the store so that my husband could price out some components for a computer that he was considering building.  We went in to price them, we came out with the components in our hot little hands.  The salesperson in computers, Michael Scudella, was amazing.  He really spent the time with us to understand what we were looking to do (build a computer that can play Diablo III when it comes out... along with other stuff that I don't care as much about but hubby does).  He was friendly, patient, and extremely knowledgeable about computer components.  I usually just "glaze over" when people begin talking "computer tech speak" but I actually had fun while my husband went all "geek" in the store.  The store is large, clean and has a huge selection of computer stuff.  I recommend it to anyone who wants a better buying experience than most of the typical big box chains for computer parts.

Floor and Decor is FABULOUS.  They have a great selection of flooring products (all except carpeting, which doesn't bother me in the least) and their prices are far better than Home Depot or Lowes.  They have great and knowledgeable associates and we were able to get all of our questions answered and left with the luxury vinyl plank flooring that we were hoping for.

We've been to Grimaldi's several times and every time it's just as fabulous as it was the last time.  Their pizza is, by far, my favorite in the valley and is always consistently good.  They have an excellent by the glass or bottle wine list and their beer selection is also good.  They have an excellent Caprese salad that we like to have as an appetizer before our pizza.  Their menu is small, mainly pizza and a few salads, so if you are looking for a place with lots of choices (pastas, sandwiches, etc) Grimaldi's may not be the place for you.  But if you are looking for amazing pizza, I would highly recommend giving Grimaldi's a try.  One thing to keep in mind:  weekend evenings can be very busy, so I suggest going at slightly off times or bringing a dose of patience.

The day I went the selection was poor, the store was disorganized and the customer service was seriously lacking. I've heard that this store is like Ross where some days you can find treasures if you are willing to dig through the crap to find them.  I guess I don't have the talent (or the time) to dig through all the tons of misplaced, random stuff to find one thing that may or may not be something I need or want.  I'm hoping that I just went on an off day for HomeGoods because I love the idea of finding great home stuff at a low price, but so far no treasures found.

Dustin at Salon D'Shayn is amazing.  I went to him for the first time yesterday for a cut and color.  He really understands color and what he did with my hair was nothing short of spectacular.   My hair looks healthy, shiny and falls perfectly.   It may have been my first time there, but it definitely won't be my last.

We have been going to the Peoria WineStyles since they opened.  I enjoy the wine tastings (free to members on Tuesday nights!) and the events that they have (bunco, special tastings, food pairings, art shows, etc) but I especially love their wine and their personal service.  Bryan and Tawna are very hands-on owners, and most often you can chat with them while they are working.  Their staff is great, Richard is a stand out, and their selections of wine is decently priced (check out their 6 wines for $60).  I have brought several friends to the store and we really enjoy a nice glass of wine before or after a movie or dinner at Grimaldi's next door.  Great place.  Nice atmosphere.

What an amazing salon.  There was a Groupon for new customers so I tried it out, and wow am I ever happy I did.  My stylist was Kenzie and she is fabulous.  She fixed my color and did some amazing highlights.  I am so happy I tried this salon.  I already made my next appointment - that's how good this one was.  :)

The best gyros on the west side!  Heck, maybe even the best gyros in the Phoenix metro area.  We always order the gyro sandwiches (practically exploding with tasty gyro meat, tomatoes, onions and yummy tzaziki sauce (you know, the yogurt, cucumber, garlic dressing -- yeah, that one... the one you lick off your fingers everytime you get it because you don't want to miss a drop of it?) in a warm soft pita and split an order of greek fries -- french fries with just the perfect amount of feta.  Fabulous.  This is a nice family owned place that is definitely worth trying if you are on the west side and have a hankering for some great gyros.

If I could give reviews to just the stylist I had, I would give a full and hearty five stars.  However, this review is about the salon as a whole.  The decor is nice but the stylists seem very catty and gossipy.  My stylist didn't seem to be part of the "clique" but those around her obviously were and it felt uncomfortable.  Also the salon plays religious music all of the time and has religious decor which gave the salon a kind of haughty vibe.  I won't be back.

I had never had a Culver's burger prior to their opening in Avondale.  They are definitely good burgers, but are a bit too greasy for my liking.  Haven't been inside the restaurant yet, having only used the drive through, but will say that the drive through was quick and they have pull ahead spots designed for those times when your order may be a little slow so they don't block up the window.  We had a Wisconsin Swiss Melt meal and a Butter Burger with bacon meal (I can't remember the exact name of the sandwich) and they were very hot and fresh though a bit too "buttery" for me.  The fries are decent, but I must admit to liking In-N-Out's fries better.  But if you are looking for a good hamburger that is different from the typical chains, I would recommend this place.  We will go back again soon.

I have been having Gus at G & D Landscaping do the clean ups and trimming on my front yard for a couple of years now.  He's excellent and my yard has never looked so good.  He always shows up when he is scheduled, is reasonably priced and really seems to know his stuff.  I am now looking at having a sprinkler system installed in my backyard and he's the first one I thought of.  I highly recommend him for the landscaping needs of the west valley.

Amazing seafood in the far west valley - finally!!  I had the shrimp in trifecta sauce (medium) with red potatoes and my husband had the Mahi Mahi badket.  It was all amazing.  The staff is all incredibly friendly (Susie is AWESOME!) the entire visit was fun and filled with the best seafood.  5 star experience.   Thank you for bringing this to Goodyear.
