Love this little, genuine place! It has great lunches and has ruined me for pad Thai anywhere else in the valley! Their soups are a must!

PERFECTION!!!!!!! I don't want to write a paragraph but I could honestly write pages about this place. The careful plating and selection of ingredients used in every mouth watering bite or delectable sip of coffee is beyond delicious! It makes you dream about going back! The staff is something other restaurants should be designed after!!! Jeff is a delight and has such a great positive energy. This is his love and passion and it shows in every area of his restaurant!!!! I have been around 10 times and it's a new experience that makes me excited to go back even before I leave!

This place has a good drink selection (although it is rarely accurate on the menu). Food is decent and I haven't been disappointed the 4 times I have been. Some sides are better than others but overall it's alright.

I had high hopes for this place. Heard lots of people rave about it; unfortunately our experience was not as pleasant. I could over look the poor service if it was exceptional in other areas (ie- beer list, food). Our dry dusted Santa Fe wings were dry to the point of making us cough. Ok it says dry in the description so I can't complain but they lacked flavor. It was like they took spices from their mothers kitchen and just drenched them.DONT ORDER THEM! The meat platter was alright; decent at best. Artichoke salad.... Terrible. The only saving grace to this evening was the pizza, but we had to scarf it down to get home to our kids because our server never stopped by to take our order past the wings. We had to flag her down. All in all, I don't typically write bad reviews, but I felt that the 4 stars that this place holds reflects poorly on it's actual food, service and selection.

Good burgers! Don't typically like chain places but this place is reliable! Been at least 5 times! Staff is friendly and nice beers! Quinoa side is overpriced for portion. Would give 5 stars, but nothing is completely out of this world here... I do recommend people to go here though!

My whole experience was amazing from start to finish! The meatballs were perfectly paired with huckleberry compote and Greek yogurt; do not miss. I had the salmon salad and I can't get it out of my head. I loved the white beans and Brussels sprouts... The cornbeef sandwich with the kale apple slaw was phenomenal. And lastly for dessert, the chocolate cake was moist and very rich. Service was friendly and attentive but not intrusive. Grant was an exceptional server. It is a little loud but if that deters you, you are seriously missing out and don't deserve such a great meal.  You have to go and try out The Henry once it opens. You will not be disappointed!

This place is beyond terrible, from the staff, to the decor followed by the service! I was pregnant at the time so I needed a slight modification to each dish (basically no goats cheese) and EVERY dish came out wrong, followed by the chef sending something else special which I also couldn't have. The only thing I enjoyed was the shrimp fish but it had a wax paper in it... We asked the manager about it and he said it was necessary because of the oils... Umm tacky and not necessary. Find a different way to plate it. Some of the sides were cold. I hated how the salsa on the menu was just salsa to add to your dish? 5$ no chips? Server had no idea what he was doing! I mean no idea... He had previously been a banquet server so didn't turkey understand service. Lastly, I hate that everyone thinks this place is so great. It is a lot of money put into a typical Scottsdale restaurant with a mediocre menu and no real charm. I came on opening week ... Yes a long time ago, but never wrote my review. So here it is.

Hostess was very nice, but it took 20mins for Mac and cheese with hot dogs. Mind you it was a good starter :) (small but good!) It took 15 mins to get a replacement beer, but it took over 25mins for our entrees! They were burgers!!! And the restaurant was empty and the kitchen was full (4-5 cooks!) Server barely checked on us. Beer selection was good, but if you have to wait that long, not worth it!!!... Overall, won't come back!!!

I can't even begin to explain how AMAZING the FOOD and STAFF are here! Coup has got some great drinks going on behind the bar, our server was fantastic, the owner is beyond accommodating and PHENOMENAL!!! (Not to mention, his lovely wife/owner/manager is a badass) Sauces are exceptional and 14hr smoked pulled pork is worth a trek from anywhere. Snow crab is always a must!!! Bottom Line: THIS IS A GREAT SPOT AND YOU HAVE TO COME TRY!!! They open on Wednesday!
