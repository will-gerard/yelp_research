This place is really cool.  The parking is plentiful and the interior is very contemporary/kawaii.  We totally expected a place similar to Spoon House in Torrence, CA but it is more Italian than Japanese atmosphere wise.  The banana bread was not as good as everyone raved to be but it was good.    We first tried the tataki and a salmon roll.  Tataki was beautifully presented on the plate and both tasted pretty good.  Hiyashi Chuka was ok...not my fav and the portion was pretty small.  Champon was full of seafood and thick noodles which was a total plus :)    The dessert...oh my, that was the best part of dinner...well, at least to me.  My bf's fav was the tiramisu.  I tried the flan and it was GREAT.  It's kinda hard to explain but it was like a mix of custard and cheesecake with a sauce that has a hint of bitterness to go with the sweet fran.  I was lucky enough to get the last piece of the night...you must try it if they have it available.  Oh and our waitress was really really nice.  She likes yelp too so we discussed how great this website is haha*  *Atmosphere = cute, lovely *Food = good.  if you like both Italian and Japanese, this place has it all. *Service = very nice.   *Price = great*  a blended drink + one appetizer + one roll + 2 entree + 2 desserts = check turned out to be around $60!

This bakery is hidden in the corner of a strip mall.  When I went in, there was a guy behind the counter.  I was expecting the usual "hi" but he never opened his mouth....he just stared at me.  Then, 4,5 guys came out from the back just to stand there.  It was REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE....  Then a lady came out.  I don't know, I felt like I had to greet her since she stood right in front of me so I said "hi."  Can you guess what she did?  She just stared at me.    It had only been around 2 or 3 min since I went in but honestly, I just couldn't wait to get out of there.  So, I purchased 5 pastries and got out.  The pastries were....ok.  I mean it wasn't bad but nothing special.  Would I go back there....NO.    *Food = ok, nothing special at all *Service = uncomfortable, a little intimidating *Location = ok *Price = ok

I've decided to try this place since I've been going to Arai Pastry in Tempe for a while and wanted to try something new.  There were many selections but honestly, I'm gonna stick with Arai Pastry from now on...here is why:  *First of all, this is not a Japanese bakery - I'm making this clear because even though there are similarities, Japanese and Chinese baked goods are most of the time, different.    *Less than so so decor - It is understood that the decor of the store has nothing to do with the quality of the baked goods.  However,  since I already know a place that is much cleaner, cuter and with polite service, I can't help but to see it as a negative.  *So so service - There were no labels on each pastry trays so I asked the store lady to tell me what was inside some of them.  All I saw was annoyance from her....maybe she was just in bad mood....I have no idea.  *I tried the following: -French horn - if you want a good one, please try the one at Lee's Sandwich -Custard cream bread - honestly, after a bite, we had to through it away...if you like custard cream bread, try the one at Arai Pastry

So far, our experience on Asian dinning in AZ has been..well, less than average.  But tonight, we were pretty content with the food at Hodori.  Finally, a place we can put on our list of fav restaurants in AZ.  *Price = a little over priced. *Portions = the meat dishes gives you a huge pile. *Side dishes = they were ok. *Service = very polite but a little slow paced.

First of all, I've never lived or been to NYC so my review might not be helpful at all to the ultimate pizza lovers.  I usually like Papa Johns or Round Table Pizza so that should tell you my lack of expertise on pizza.  Now, if you still want my review, here it is...it wasn't my favorite.  Would we go back? Probably, NO.  If you want good Italian, try Vincitorio's.  *Shrimp Scampi Pizza......yeah...no, it definitely wasn't for me...it was more like hardened pasta and tiny, pre-cooked shrimp on bread. *Calzone - pretty good. *Decor - I'm definitely not used to the "authentic NY" style....

Totally cool.  This is probably the biggest Asian market in AZ.  Since it is a  Chinese market, I expected the typical things only BUT I was wrong.  They have Japanese, Korean, Indian, Filipino, etc etc etc.  On top of that they have amazing selections of fresh vegetables and fruits.....and FISH!  *Fish = this is the only place I know so far that sells fresh fish *Meat = fresh *Vegetables + Fruits = totally fresh, many many selections *Dried foods = amazing selections *Service = fast

Chandler residents, try this place if you like Sushi.  If you live around Chandler/Mesa area, you know how hard it is to find a descent sushi place unlike areas around north Scottsdale.    We ordered few appetizers, multiple sushi and few rolls.  The appetizers and the sushi were pretty good for the most part.  But I do have to mention that the rice for one of the sushi was horrifying.  I've never had rice fall apart on me when I tried to pick it up.  It was soggy and all I could taste was sugar.  Honestly, I'm amazed that the rice kept its nigiri shape on the plate.  I don't know what happened on that particular sushi but yeah, that was unappetizing.  The rolls were ok but nothing special at all.  The portions were tiny and the flavor was barely there.    So, from our point of view, this restaurant is pretty much on the same level as Kabuki in Old Town Pasadena, CA with an authentic Japanese sushi restaurant feel b/c of the presence of Japanese staff and the decor.  That being said, it was really interesting to us because usually, a non-authentic sushi restaurants try to cover their lack of skill by serving pretty good rolls (which is basically an Americanized sushi.)  But this place served better sushi than rolls.  So kudos to them.  Hence, it affected my rating along with the location to 4 stars.        *Location = thank goodness that there is at least one pretty good sushi place around Chandler area *Food = pretty good *Service = very good *Atmosphere = nice and hip *Price = expected for AZ sushi place = over $100/a couple

The atmosphere was a little different from what we expected.  It is much more relaxing and casual than the ones we've been to in L.A.  The waiter was very polite and funny at the same time.  He seemed relieved and excited to serve our table since we were the only under 50 table in the whole restaurant.  *Steaks = very yummy.  cooked to perfection.   *Decor = a little on the vintage side *Service = wonderful

This place is less than average in my book.  I've been to....probably around 8, 9 nail salons so far both in Cali and Arizona and this is probably one of the worst.  The ladies are very chatty and loud, the salon is average in cleanliness and there really is nothing special about this place.  I did mani/pedi with french and design....and yeah, it was less than average quality.  My pedi didn't last more than 1 week afterwards...which is very odd to me because it usually lasts about 3 weeks or more.  One good thing was the massage....it was long and strong.  I recommend flower nails for people who wants to feel cozy and family oriented.  If you are the type who wants to feel pampered like a princess without the pretentiousness and outrageous prices, I would go to Pink Polish.  *Decor = average or less *Price = cheap *Service = ....average for a cheap, neighborhood nail salon

As like the one in Chandler, it is more on the casual side then what we are used to in L.A.  We decided to go for our Vday dinner since they offered both set and regular menus that night.  We were gonna order from the regular menu since we usually are not fond of set menu.  However, the set menu looked pretty good and the server was trying hard to sell it so we decided to give it a try.  *Appetizer = pretty nice* *Main course = huge! and tasty. *Sides = honestly, not good *Atmosphere = louder than desired....

This is a real Japanese sushi restaurant...I say this because there are plenty of "fake" sushi places all over.  We were in AZ for few days to house hunt before moving permanently and this place made us feel a little easy about moving from L.A..  *Price = pricey compared to L.A. sushi restaurants *Quality = very good (sweet shrimp was a small) *Service = very good *Atmosphere = bright and cheerful

This place and Fujiya Market are the only two Asian markets I've found in Arizona so far that's really JAPANESE.  It is a little far away from where I live so I usually end up going to Fujiya Market but IF I need something specific, I usually make my effort to drive up there.    *Selection in general = this place has more selection than Fujiya Market *Rice = seems a little cheaper than Fujiya Market *Japanese videos/DVDs = rentals and for sale  Like Fujiya Market, they don't have fresh fruits or vegetables.

Lovely restaurant.  The first time we went there, both of our filet mignons were over-cooked.  We usually let go of the fact and finish our dinner but it was just totally off the mark that we had to send them back to the kitchen.  After few min, the manager of the restaurant with the waiter came to apologized and then the head chef came out himself with our new filet mignons and fresh side dishes.  He took his time to converse with us for at least 20min and thanked us for our understanding that things like this happen sometimes with new chefs in training.  *Filet Mignon = wonderful *Service = exceptionally great *Atmosphere = very relaxing and classy.

Finally, a perfect car wash place!  Seriously, I think this is as good as it gets.  You don't have to make small talks with the attendants, the wash is great, and it's a good price for what you get.  As you drive in, the first thing you see is the clear list of services.  I got the basic which is $12.99.  You receive the receipt from the attendant and pay inside.  The whole process is automated BUT after the soap is sprayed onto the car, the washing part is 100% manual = HAND WASH.  Then the soap is washed off with automated water sprays.  When the car comes out, the wipe off, interior cleaning and window wipe is 100% manual again.  The whole process takes about 15min or so but it is soooo worth it.  While I was there, I saw BMW, Mercedes Mclaren and Porsche...which is a totally good sign b/c it is obvious that these people care very much about their cars.  *Location = ok *Service = it is very much to the point.  very quick. *Process = very good.  precise hand washing + quick automated process   *Price = totally worth it

Ok, I thought that all Arizona Auto Wash locations are the same.  But it's NOT.  After going to another location, I've found out that this is one of the few places that literally do hand wash.  It does not do special deals like $10 basic wash but that extra $2 is totally worth it.  If you care about your car, go here!

Wow....it looks like I'm the only one who likes this place...  I went here today too and it did make me drop one star for how awkward they made me feel.  But I'm still giving 4 stars for the fact that they did a really good job washing/cleaning my car.    When I drove up, 4 guys were just standing there staring the whole time.  The guy who came up to take the order was really rude.  When he asked me a question, I couldn't understand him because of his accent so I said "I'm sorry?"  and his response was "yes or no."  I just said no since I didn't wanna ask anymore.    Now, I always get the most basic $12.99 car wash and maybe that's why I'm satisfied every time.....or maybe my standards for a car wash place is lower than most people?!?.....I have no idea.

I was a brat to think that I'll be deprived of Japanese pastries and baked goods in AZ.  Of course, it is not the same compared to L.A. Japanese Bakeries but Arai Pastry is more than what I expected.    *Selection = not as many BUT they are all pretty good. *Quality =  spongy is better than mousse (it is surprising because I usually like mousse way more) *Bread Loaf = Amazing! Very spongy (fuwa fuwa) and freshly baked. *Service = Polite and attentive *Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich = Yummy *Green tea smoothie = GOOD :)

This place and New Tokyo Market are the only Asian places I've found so far in Arizona that's really JAPANESE.    The store is pretty small but has enough things to stock up your pantry until your next trip to L.A.    *Cosmetics/Bathroom = ok selection *Rice = several kinds *Snacks = plenty *Dried stuff = plenty (Curry, Dried Seaweed, etc) *Frozen stuff = good amount (Natto, Udon, Ramen, Tsukemono, etc) *Drinks = good selection of Japanese soft drinks  The one complaint I have is that they don't have fresh fruits or vegetables.  You can find them in other markets like Asiana market or Lee Lee's.

We decided to try this place because of the good rating overall on yelp.  When we went in, we realized that we probably should have kept looking for another restaurant.  When you don't see any Asians in a Chinese restaurant on Saturday night, it gives you a pretty good idea as to what kinda food they serve.  Don't get me wrong though. We usually do like Americanized Chinese food.  But this place is not for us.  *Appetizer = mu shu pork with tortilla....the mu shu looked like pile of vegetable and meat scraps *Main dishes = oily.....too sweet....not a fan *Atmosphere = full of kids

***Dinner buffet review*** Reasonable price for nice variety including crabs and prime rib  So my husband and I are very much buffet fanatics when visiting Vegas.  We usually end up going to buffet at least once a day.    We always loved Bellagio buffet and have been here several times.  It has a great mix of pretty much what you expect in a buffet.  Considering price, food choices (seafood included), ambiance, it is a solid 4 stars.  * Food:   - Snow and King crabs = cut in half and COLD.  The best thing about the crabs here is that they have plenty of them out so you won't have to stand in line for so long.  (HINT:  Snow crabs are actually more tasty than the King crabs...I know, it's werid)  - Prime Rib = very yummy, very fast line.  * Price: $29.95/person (Thursday night)  * Ambiance = typical casino buffet.  Very nice but not so nice that you feel awkward carrying a plate full of crab legs and melted butter.    * Service = Very attentive.  No need to ask for refills or taking away dirty dishes.

This place rescued me from homesickness.  It was about a week after our move from L.A. when I found this place.  I honestly didn't think place like this existed in AZ.    *Bread = very good. *Sandwiches = My fav are #6 bbq pork and #11 combo special *Lee's coffee = mmm....good :) *pastries = they are good but had better. *Boba = ...not so good *Drinks = they are ok.

I love this location and ambiance.  It's bright, hip and open late.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if we didn't have a horrible dinner at Akai Hana Sushi.  When we drove up around 10pm on Sat night, there were so many people still out enjoying themselves.  They have good selections and the flavors are pretty good.   *Ambiance = cool, hip, fun *Gelato = I still prefer flavors of Gelato 64 but it's definitely similar enough *Service = very good

***Monday Lunch review*** No crabs, no prime rib... not even cocktail shrimps...  Our last day in Vegas so decided to try Wynn.  The hotel itself was beautiful and the buffet was decorated so beautifully it was pretty amazing.  Now, the food.  Aside from the disappointment of no crabs and prime ribs...the selection of food was just not there...  I mean it was so sad that my husband had a slice of marinated Kobe beef and couscous...  Dessert selection was small but good.  I liked the mojito cake.     * Ambiance = VERY beautiful...I mean it is one of the best decorated buffets we've seen before.  * Service = bad.  Had to ask for everything...  * Price = expensive for the selections offered.  We paid $24/person.

I was here one night to get some dishes to go.  Honestly, I don't understand why the rating is so high.  Maybe I went on the wrong night.  The decor is really cute and the service is really nice but...that's pretty much it.    I ordered L&L Hawaiian BBQ Mix, Seafood Mix, and Spam musubi.    The first problem was rice.  Part of it was overcooked and soggy, the other part, uncooked.  Any Asian dish has to have at least "descent" rice to enjoy the rest of the plate.      The second problem was the seafood.  I understand that this is not Roy's but still, it would have been nice if they could have given me a real piece of fish and shrimps instead of all panko and batter.  *Food = badly cooked rice ruined pretty much everything *Decor = very cute *Location = it looked a little shady but it was around 8pm and very dark *Service = very nice *Price = ok but not worth what I received.

3 stars for food 4 stars for everything else  We wanted to try something new and so we decided to try this place.  First of all, I love the fact that they have plenty of free parking; even on a Sat night.  The restaurant is actually much larger than I thought with the huge back room where we were seated.    Since it is a German restaurant, we were ready to try their beer but didn't have a clue as to which one...our waitress took delivery of bringing us samples to see which one we favor.  That was very nice of her.  After ordering the beer, we had the imported pretzel, Paprika Schnitzel, Sauerbraten.    *Pretzel = YUM!  It was crusty on the outside and very chewy inside. *Paprika Schnitzel = very much like Japanese cutlet.  Not as flavorful.. *Sauerbraten = we tried it because we heard that it takes 4 days.  Honestly, the only thing we could taste was the thick sauce, the meat was kinda tough, and the pasta was bland.  On the upside, I liked the red cabbage.  Overall, it was a great experience with live German music, great beer and pretzel.   But would we go back?...probably not.  *Ambiance = Wonderful!  It doesn't really feel like AZ. *Food = mediocre...we prefer more flavor *Area = good.  in the middle of old town Glendale. *Service = great.  we had a wonderful waitress who took very good care of us.

We were in AZ house hunting and our real estate agent suggested this place.  We are glad to have a place we can casually go for yummy calamari.    *Calamari = wonderful....crispy, light, flavored just perfectly *Pasta = pretty good. *Bread = good. *Decor = honestly, it's kinda outdated....but it also gives you the family atmosphere feel. *Service = very nice.

***Friday Brunch review*** Warm snow crabs~!!!  This is the first time we found "WARM SNOW CRABS" in Vegas!   We love the warm crab legs down in Biloxi, MS and always wished to find the same in Vegas.  Now we did!!!  Food:  The warm snow crabs just made our day hence the 4 stars....otherwise, we would have given this buffet 3 stars.  Everything else was just OK.  Very nice but OK.  The prime rib was very nice but I liked Bellagio's better for some reason.  From Apple crepes to fried rice, they were all pretty good.  However, the selections were very limited.  I was very disappointment with the eggs benedict...I guess it is standard practice to use hard eggs to keep the shape but hmm...   Price:  $25 I think...We had $20/person vouchers so not sure of the EXACT price...sorry.  Ambiance = Very nice.  Typical casino buffet style restaurant on the strip.  Clean and nice...nothing special.  Service = Umm...  Had to ask for straw, every refill, piles of plates just left alone for a long time.  I think they were short staffed???....not sure.

Honestly, I'm not going back.  We were craving Japanese bbq one day.  When we asked around, people recommended Takamatsu and so we decided to give it a try.  The service was very nice and the restaurant was full of people, mostly Caucasians.  Until we find a good Japanese bbq place in Arizona, we are gonna stick with Korean food @ Chodang.    *They serve Korean bbq, NOT Japanese bbq.  (If you do not know the difference, please try Gyu Kaku in L.A.) *The meat = frozen and tough *Side dishes = plenty but average...or less. *Decor = very run down... *Portions = wonderful, so much food/person *Area = not too desirable *Drinks = I ordered soft drinks not knowing that there were no refills

This place made me feel comfortable about moving to Arizona.  I just moved from L.A. and was totally worried about not having access to Asian stuff.  Of course it is not comparable to L.A. but this place has all the essentials.  *Vegetables = fresh *Meat = frozen *Fish = frozen *Dried food = plenty *Bread = they bring in baked goods from Olive Bakery in L.A. *Cooking supplies = half of the store is full of them

First of all, it is very hard to find this place partly because of the construction going on in the complex.  Don't give up though because they do a good job.  The place is definitely family owned and very cozy.  When I was there, there were 2 girls and 2 guys working.  They love chatting with customers.  I did a pedi with french tip + design AND pink & white full set for my hands.....I think I paid around $80 for the whole thing.  Usually, my nails are kinda short so when they put the pink & white, you can see the line underneath.  The wonderful thing about this place is, they were able to cover the lines with really perfect designs which totally won me over.  Really, if you want nice designs, this place is it.  *Decor = cute *Price = average *Service = great if you are in the mood to chat

Love it.  As I've mentioned in my first review, the place gives you a very comfortable, family feel to the customers.  Oh and the place is very clean and cute without over exaggeration like at Pink Polish.    Pricing menu: Acrylic full set:  $25 White tip full set:  $28 Pink and White full set:  $35 Silk full set:  $35 Crystal full set:  $32 Gel full set:  $32  Manicure:  $12 Spa pedicure:  $22 Deluxe pedicure:  $35 Manicure + Pedicure:  $32  French:  $5 Design:  $5

YUMMY! We are from L.A. and so we have pretty high standards when it comes to boba but this place....it is great!  I actually think this is the best boba place  ever.  My bf thinks this is probably #2 in his list.  *Texture = very mochi like...so soft and very flavorful. *Decor = pretty hip. *Milk tea = pretty good.   *Slush = It wasn't the ordinary sugary sweet taste you get from flavored syrup.  I was actually able to taste the tanginess of the fruit. *Service = very polite and fast.

This place is very clean and decor is well put in an old school Asian way.  The lighting is pretty dim and the huge space makes you feel a little bored.  The owners were too busy chatting with the customers at one table that other customers were feeling a little out of place.    Anyway, the basil, lemon and bean sprouts for the pho was amazingly fresh.  The lemon was perfectly ripe, basil was not wilting, and every single bean sprouts had their ends trimmed....it's pretty amazing how much detail they put into their vegetables.  The pho was pretty good and the best part was that there was so much meat in it.  The rice dish was ok but the portion was very small.  The spring rolls...I've never seen such tiny spring rolls but the flavors were very nice.    I have to tell you about their bathroom.  It was nice, clean, and spacious.  I don't know about the men's side but lady's bathroom is one of the nicest I've seen in a public location.  They even use the bath & body works hand soap.  *Location = convenient, right across the street from Lee Lee's Market *Price = on the expensive side for pho *Decor = traditional nice...you don't have to feel like you are compromising your standard for niceness just b/c you want pho *Service = efficient but it would be nice if the owners treat every customer equally  Would we go back? Sure Is this our first choice for pho? No, we still prefer Pho Ao Sen overall

I'm giving 4 stars instead of 3 for the following reasons:  1.  It is open on holidays - I know, some might say that Chinese places are supposed to be/usually open 365 days.  But this place was the 4th place we called and we were getting desperate and hungry. 2.  Orange chicken - I usually do not like orange chicken but I really liked the flavor here. 3.  The service was really nice - the waitress was really nice, cute and patient.   *Ambiance = I did takeout BUT I saw the interior of the place and it was actually nice. *Price = descent *Food = good for AZ Chinese food but not fully satisfied. So would I go back? YES Would I search and try other places before going back here? YES

umm....no...this place is definitely not for us....  I've read all the positive reviews and was totally excited to try this place today.  We've been craving really good Chinese food that would satisfy our spoiled pallet from Cali.  "Inexpensive, great food, nice service"...sounded nice...  First of all, yes the service is really nice.  They were very relaxed and ready to serve you.  The order took around 15min for a take out which is pretty fast.    Second, the price....yes it is on the cheap side but is it really that inexpensive?  For example, compared to Phoenix Palace, most typical menu items are maybe ~$2.00 or so cheaper...but if you ask me, you are compromising the quality of the food for that few dollars you are saving.  Third, the food....OILY....really...OILY.   *Chili salt chicken wings = 5 pieces for $2.99.  Good price, dry, bland, not worth it. *Orange chicken = burnt, drowning in dark sauce, couldn't tell where the meat was... *XO sauce beef =....we found....6 pieces of beef slices and the rest was corn starch and onion mush...with orange colored oil all over. *Bean sauce chow fun with squid = this was the only ok dish.  Tons of squid which was cool, but not much chow fun at all...and again, oily.  Overall, we didn't like it.   Are we gonna go back = NO Maybe try again someday? = NO  *Location = good, right across the street from Mekong Plaza *Food = the extra $2.00 is so worth it at other restaurants. *Service = very nice *Decor = very plain

We went here last night for the first time.  It is true that the exterior of the building is a tiny bit shady but it's not as bad as I thought.  I think the problem is horrible lighting since there aren't many building around that area.  The place is really clean and and welcoming.  The servers were nice and the food was way better than Hodori...both in Mesa and L.A.  We are totally glad that we tried this place and will be regulars from now on.     *Food = very good.   -Beef and Seafood Sundubu actually had oyster in it -Chodang Galbi = it was marinated very well -Side dishes = 6 totally YUMMY sides -Rice = STONE pot!  *Ambiance = friendly, comfortable and very clean *Service = pretty good *Price = average for AZ   One thing though...I miss the sundubu and meat combination at BCD Tofu House in L.A.  If Chodang start offering combinations, oh I would so be there at least once a week!

We were here last night wanting some good ribs.  It is one of the cutest little diner-ish restaurant surrounded by the trees and acres of land.  The ordering process is pretty much the same as the original Joe's real bbq in Gilbert but the decor and ambiance is way different.  It is much more contemporary.  I must say, until last night, I had the assumption that this place is a restaurant...you know, like Cracker Barrel and such.  But It is pretty much as casual as the Joe's real bbq which gives more character to the place.  After all, real bbq should be done self-serve style :)  My bf tried the Fontina Burger and I had the Baby back ribs with Mango milkshake.  (note:  Mango milkshake is limited time only so you should try it NOW)  We got our pager and waited maybe around 20min?...yeah, it was a little long but it's all good.  We were enjoying the nice, calm breeze outside.    The food was great!  We were a little skeptical since we didn't really have a wonderful time at Joe's real bbq.  But the baby back ribs were very tender and juicy with great flavor.  The winner though was the Fontina burger.  The little hint of pesto did the trick we think.  The fries...we preferred the regular fries over the sweet potato.  It tastes wonderful the first few bites but afterwards, you kinda feel like you had enough...you know?    Overall, it was a great experience.  I know that I have the tendency to complain saying "it is not as good as L.A." but this place is different.  There is no way that a place like this exists in L.A. and we love it.  *Food = great *Service = good but you basically serve yourself *Price = good *Decor = very cool.  OH YOU HAVE TO SEE THE BATHROOM.  I know it's kinda weird for me recommend seeing the bathroom in a restaurant but it is one of the COOLEST BATHROOMS I've ever been into.

We've been here twice because well, we are new to AZ and didn't know anywhere else.  They have a big menu...but that's it.  I mean we didn't expect anything more than cheesecake factory but yeah...from my point of view, it wasn't even to cheesecake level.  The service was descent though.  *Food = ordinary, quickly prepared American food *Service = descent  *Atmosphere =....interesting... *Price = ok

My bf is a little sick right now and I was craving Thai.  Since it was the weekend, I didn't wanna cook you know?    Few weeks ago, we got the Entertainment book.  So we looked through and there was a coupon for 20% off entire bill of at least $25 total.  So we looked on yelp and even though there weren't too many reviews, it looked positive.  The distance seemed a little too far for a pick up but I figured, I usually drive that distance to go to Asiana Market and Mekong anyway so it's no big deal.  I got on the phone, started ordering...it took about 10 min to order the whole thing because they couldn't figure out the difference between my pronounciation of Pad Thai and Satay.  It's my fault I guess...I did feel bad repeating "no no, it's Pad Thai...the noodle?"...:(    I got there and it was kinda weird since there were no customers in the entire restaurant.  The lights were off, and the only thing lit was the OPEN sign.  To be honest, we probably would not have ordered from there if we've seen the place first.  When I went in, a lady greeted me with a huge smile and her son came out, also with a huge smile.  They were very nice and when I was about to walk out of the restaurant with my food they shouted out with a smile "COME AGAIN MY DEAR!"  So we ordered the following: Chicken satay  $6.95 Curry puff  $5.95 Green curry  $8.95 Pad thai  $8.95 2 Homemade Thai tea  $5.00  The Meh....:  The chicken stay was pretty much what you get anywhere else, Pad thai was a little too spicy and the Thai tea was definitely different since it was made from some kinda syrup but there was too much cream and diluted the whole thing a little too much.    Now to the good stuff:  The curry puff was very fluffy, flavorful and just plain yummy!  I would so recommend it.  The green curry was definitely homemade.  So much vegetables and beef with great flavor...oh it was good.  So overall, especially with the 20% off coupon, it was a pretty good deal.  I don't know why there weren't any customers in the restaurant...I guess Sunday night is a slow time to do business.    *Food = pretty good, homemade *Price = good, go through the entertainment book if you have it. *Service = good, very friendly *Decor = bare...but the lady's smile brightens up the atmosphere*

Lovely place to have a nice dinner.  We were here for the Christmas Eve dinner.  The place was packed with people enjoying themselves.    We were seated right away but the waitress did not come over for at least 5 min.  We didn't think it was a big deal but as the night progressed, it got worse...it's understandable though I guess...you know, with tons of customers that night.  We started off with glasses of wine, calamari and french onion soup.  The calamari was very fluff and tasteful with huge portions enough for 2,3 people.  My fiance loved his french onion soup so much that he didn't share enough with me haha.    Then we had the ribeye and filet with sauteed asparagus and Mastro's mashed potatoes.  The ribeye was very tasteful and tender with right amount of fat.  The filet was seasoned very well and also tender.  I must say though that we still prefer Ruth Chris's filet over Mastro's.  The size of the meats were HUGE that we couldn't even finish half of them.    *Location = very nice, right next to Scottsdale Fashion Square *Food = amazing but be ready to bring back half of your dinner with you home. *Service = not so good that night but I think she still did her best. We thought it was interesting how Ruth Chris's waiters in comparison are much  more professional. *Ambiance = very chic but not so romantic

This location is right in the middle of Tempe Marketplace which is very convenient.  When you walk in, you see the very interesting and contemporary decor.  This is definitely a chain restaurant but that's ok.  There is such thing as chain restaurant that serves yummy food :)    The service was very prompt and nice.  We had usual selections of sushi which turned out to be ok, spicy tuna roll, and kabuki roll which was very interesting...better than we expected.  The ama-ebi was bigger and sweeter than the one served at Shimogamo.  Oh and Ikura (salmon roe) was fresh.  Price wise, it was more than what we are used to b/c the prices at Kabuki in Old Town Pasadena, CA are usually cut in half all night long.  Overall, it was good enough to add to the list of fav/convenient restaurants.  So Shimogamo? or Kabuki?......I say Kabuki b/c of it's fun location.  You get to shop, have desserts, and the area is very lively.   *Location = good *Price = expected...around $90/couple without alcohol *Food = pretty good

This place is definitely the cleanest and cutest nail salon that I've ever been to.  I actually like it better than places like Bellacures in Beverly Hills, CA because it's not pretentious.  I did the Pink Polish Pedicures for $30 + design for $5 + french tip for $5 = $40 total.  Honestly, I thought the massage could be little longer but overall, it was really nice.  The lady didn't try to make small talks and actually let me relax the whole time AND the design turned out very cute.  After everything was done, they didn't try to rush me out of the place like most places do either.  *Decor = CUTE and clean *Price = average or tiny bit more *Service = good   Here are some of the prices:  Express pedicure  $18 Pink Polish spa pedicure  $30 (Sugar scrub massage) Deluxe Pedicure  $45  (Sugar scrub massage with heel treatment)  Classic manicure  $15 Deluxe manicure  $22  French manicure polish  $5 Nail design  $5+  Acryllic full set  $30+ White tip full set  $32+ Pink & white full set  $45+

Ok, I'm never gonna go back.    This time, I just wanted a manicure...I mean is there anything wrong with that?  Apparently, the girl who did my nails didn't think just a regular manicure was not worth her time.  She tried her hardest to hurry up my session....I don't know why because there weren't any other customers in line.  My cuticles were bleeding and skin started to flaked away after 2 days since her work was really rough and without care.  When she started massaging, it actually hurt because she kept on pulling my arms and was massaging hard to pretty much make me say "ok, please stop, I had enough."  At the end, my polish turned out to be very uneven and messy.  Seriously, I am not gonna pay money to be treated like this any longer.  Flower Nails in Chandler will be my new oasis from now on.

I understand that pho restaurants are usually not fancy but this place is pretty ghetto.  We were greeted by a Caucasian waiter and led to a table right next to the glass window overlooking the customers at Lee Lee's market.  It was pretty dark inside with only 5 customers on a Saturday night.  *Decor = dark, casual, no privacy...it's almost like eating in a food court. *Price = on the high end for pho *Service = the bare minimum *Food: -Spring rolls = ok....but it was mostly lettuce -Rice dish with pork bbq = ok...but portions wise, not much -Pho = the soup is VERY bland

YUM!  Finally, a place we like.  This place is really clean, pretty, and contemporary :)...unusual for a Pho restaurant right?  The original location is in northern Cali so we were totally excited to get there.  The menu is very simple but enough to satisfy your taste buds.  Oh, the restaurant is away from the major street hidden behind other shops so be patient.  *Food = very good -chicken wings = YUM YUM YUM. You should really try it at least once. -Spring rolls = I never had it with such a nice aroma -Korean bbq = I don't know why my bf ordered this at a Pho place but it was good. -Pho = to be honest, it was a little bland BUT good.

We were here on a usual AZ summer day = over 100F so yeah, we liked it very much.  BUT this place is still not as good as Pinkberry.  The store is cute and it is at a good location but yeah the flavor...it's not as tangy.  They do have many fruit toppings which is a total plus ;)  *This is the closest thing to Pinkberry we've found so far*  *Yogurt = good but not as good as Pinkberry *Service = average *Decor = cute, it does remind me of Pinkberry somewhat.

....Speechless.....I mean really...I don't understand how anyone could call THAT sushi.  I usually don't flat out say horrible...but this place, it is horrible.  I understand that there are people who have not been exposed to anything but this so called sushi place.  If you are one, please please do not think this is it.  If you want good sushi in Arizona, try Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale.  Yes, it is more expensive but at least you are eating SUSHI.    *Decor = trying very hard to be "hip" *Atmosphere = loud with drunk people all over *Food = SUCKS...really, they truly suck *Service = slow

I was determined to try local bakeries before submitting to the chain bakeries.  But after going through so much for just a piece of nice bread/pastry, I was ready to give up.  After reading the reviews for this place, I decided to give it a try since I go to Trader Joe's right next door usually anyways.  I tried few pastries to go and every single one of them was really yummy! *Blueberry cream cheese muffin = YUM *Cheese danish = YUM *Chocolate croissant = YUM *Chocolate palmier = YUM  *Location = good, next to Trader Joe's *Service = good *Price = good  So yeah, I'm definitely going back...I'm done wasting my time to find that special local bakery.

I didn't know that this place existed until today when I accidentally missed the entrance to Asiana Market and drove on.  If I knew earlier, I would have totally ditched Lee Lee long time ago.  This place is clean, new, and has fresh products. Oh and the fish are not just FRESH but they have VARIETY.  They actually filet/fry fish for you at the station like they do in the Cali markets.    *Store = Clean, NEW *Groceries = FRESH, VARIETY of fish *Service = GOOD *Location = ~2min from Asiana Market and ~10min from Lee Lee.

I was here on a Sat morning for a pick up order.  It was a right move on my part since the line was so long outside!  I went in to place my order and it took around 15min.  Everyone was very helpful and friendly.    *Protein Pancake - yummy.  You can taste so many things in the pancakes  like blueberries.  *California Benedict - It was good.  English muffin with avocados, tomatoes, bacon and poached egg with hollandaise sauce.  I've made something very similar before but what made this dish special was the poached egg.  It was PERFECT.  *Service = very good.    *Food = yummy *Price = average.  $15 total *Ambiance = a little iHop-ish but in a good way :)

Never going back.  When we got there, we were like "wait, is this Mr. Sushi? or Akaihana Sushi?" since the restaurant has both names in front.  When you go in, you see the sushi counter with one Japanese chef and rest, Mexican chefs.  They seated us at the very back corner where it was pretty dark.....it was so dark that we had to squint our eyes to see the menu.  There were screaming kids, squeaking fans all over and waitresses having fun chatting.  The food...omg, it's as bad as Ra.  We ordered combination plate b., i., and "mistake" roll.  Believe me they are all BAD....afterwards, I got a tummy ache......sigh.  *Ambiance = dark, low-class *Service = if you like your waitresses having fun chatting about their relationships and stuff, yeah you will like it *Food = .....BAD -beef teriyaki = TOUGH -sashimi = it's interesting how a Japanese person can serve that proudly and call it sashimi. -california roll = we usually do our best to finish the plate but it was just not possible. -tempura = ok overall but they definitely use OLD oil -rice = cheap rice for sure.

This place provides the following services:  Fingerprinting, TB skin testing, Flu shots, CPR classes, etc.  It is a little hard to find since it is nestled at the back side of the building.  But once you find the door, you are set.  I had to get fingerprinting done and so I went in, signed in, paid $15, got fingerprinted, and I was DONE.  The whole process took....10min?  If you need fingerprinting, this is a good place to go.  *Service = very nice.  The lady who helped me was very communicative and made you feel comfortable. *Price = I know that there are $10/card places but I would definitely go back to this place for the $5 extra if I need another service. *Location = at first glance, you might think...really? neon signs?...but once you get in, you see that it is a legitimate business.
