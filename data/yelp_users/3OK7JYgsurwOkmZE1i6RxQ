Flawless experience! Service was amazing, very friendly staff! Great lil mom and pop type feel to it. Food was out of this world. Very laid back atmosphere.. Nice surprise for a little hole in the wall Italian restaurant. The lasagna and veal meatballs were on point!

My girlfriends and I decided to go out for dinner and drinks tonight. We picked La Grande Orange because we had never been there before. When we got there, there was a wait so I decided to go to the bar to get a glass of wine in the meantime. I asked the bartender for a glass of Pinot Noir. Considering all of the wines on the menu posted above the bar were around $6.00 to $8.00, I figured my drink would be about the same price. However when she gave me my glass of wine, I was shocked to see it was $14.00. When we finally got seated, we were handed an actual drink menu from the waitress. To my surprise, the Pinot Noir BOTTLES of wine they had available were between $9.00 and $20.00.. I expressed my disbelief that I just paid $14.00 for one glass when an entire bottle was sold there for less. The waitress basically told me that I had been ripped off by the bartender. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars rather than 1 is because our waitress was honest and straightforward, and the food was very good. However, I can't get over the fact that the brunette bartender who works Friday night would secretly serve me one of the most expensive glasses of wine at the bar. Shame on you!

This place seemed very legit at first. I came here because I needed a new car battery. They told me to pull it right up and they would test it on the spot, even though there were many other cars waiting to be fixed. The staff was very friendly, but it might be because I seem like a helpless little girl. They tested it and determined I did, indeed, need a new battery. They told me to hang tight and it would be a "few minutes" for them to put it in. Here I am, an hour and 45 minutes later and I have no idea how much longer it's even going to be. Be prepared to stay for hours no matter what they tell you.

I am so disappointed after coming to Hakkasan. Warning anyone who comes to hakkasan, there is a theft ring who goes around stealing phones and wallets out of girls' purses while they are holding them on the dance floor. Protect yourself! Hakkasan Las Vegas Nightclub should be working towards helping prevent the problem. I understand that there's not much they can do but at least they should be producing a disclaimer about the unbelievable amount of theft that is going on in their nightclub and possibly step up security! Two girls in our group got their phones and credit cards stolen and we were just two of many! be careful!!! such a disappointing end to the trip. And very disappointing the management doesn't do a thing to prevent this.

Came here after work today. Had a great time golfing. We obviously had some drinks that were very tasty. A few of our more tipsy friends got a ride home with the more sober people and when we called to make sure it was ok to leave the cars over night, we were informed that unless you have a flat tire or dead battery, you are not allowed to leave you car. This makes me think they encourage drunk driving. Be careful.
