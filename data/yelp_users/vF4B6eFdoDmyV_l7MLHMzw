**This place looses a star because I got hasseled for writing this review!!*  The Heard is many things to many people.   For Non-natives it is a place to learn about the various cultures of ancient, recent historical and modern Native Culture.   For Natives of the southwest - it is a place where we are understood and celebrated.  There are so many things I love about this place and I am pleased to share with you my favorite spots in the museum. - The Navajo Sand painting that is displayed the Navajo Hogan in the Homelands Exhibit. It depicts the Navajo Creation Story and is intricate and beautiful.  - The Hopi Wedding Dress inside the Homelands Exhibit  - The Photograph of the Grave yard outside the Indian School in the Boarding School Experience.   - The Statue of Native women outside the museum.   - The Yazzie Mural inside the We Are exhibit. It depicts the story of the Navajo and Yaqui Tribe's modern history.   -The beaded chucks in the Shoes exhibit! I want a pair!!  When it comes to the Heard's Gift shop: now this place is amazing!! Many of their pieces are authentic and hand crafted. BUT THERE ARE FAKES AMONG THEM!!! Feel free to ask a lot of questions. Even try to negotiate prices. You never know, some of those pieces have been there for YEARS! Demand certificates of authenticity. Ask to know the meaning of symbols and designs. Know what materials they're made out of!   There could be two bracelets that almost identical and one could be silver plated and one could be solid silver. And they could both be priced the same. ASK QUESTIONS!! Ask to try to stuff on. They are usually pretty nice about this, except when it comes to earrings. Many hard to find books can be found here. Whenever someone is doing a research project, the Heard is one of the first places I recommend. I recommend the photography books.  Their exhibits are always changing. So check the website and see what's new. Have fun, bring a friend, and open your mind and see the many wonderful facets of Native American Culture.  ****UPDATE**** One of our fellow yelpers Deb K. http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sGzHUN7UpjXUGKckrv-bTw has sent me private messages asking me to edit my review and I am! She believes and knows that all the pieces are authentic at the Heard's Gift Shop.   She has said and I quote: "Hi Cher, Deb K. here--actually, I do work at the Heard and I can tell you that everything that we sell is authentic."  and she even goes on to say, "Maybe you're thinking about those dreamcatchers and whatnots in the back? Even those have to come from a Native-owned and operated establishment. [although I do agree they're kind of tacky, but you know the bilagaanas (White People)...they do like their kitschy stuff]" And what really got me was: "I really feel you should go back and change the part about the shop offering 'fake' items".   As a Native American, sometimes it's a love/hate relationship with the Heard. The Heard is the premier launching pad for non-natives in this city to experience Indian Country but sometimes it comes at a price. We are often objectified and practically forced to share that which is sacred to us. But it's allowed and it's a choice that each Native artist that has dealt with has the Heard made for themselves.   There is an unequal representation of Tribes on display at the Heard, the Navajo exhibit is HUGE at the Heard and yet the O'odham exhibit is medium sized. Even though O'odhams have contributed over $1,000,000.00 to the museum. We don't complain, atleast our ways are being shared right? And it's nice to take children to the museum and see their little eyes light up when they see things that reminds them of home. And the Boarding School Exhibit opens MANY eyes to the history that existed just a few blocks north. This slices through me and I'm so grateful this piece of history is no longer being ignored.  Like I said - it's a love/hate relationship. I love the Heard because they give opportunities to Native Artists and share our culture as sensitively as possible. But it's an uphill battle to be deemed good enough to be one of those artists and people who shares our culture. I know of many great people who I personally feel should be "let in" be denied and my heart goes out to them. I love that Natives still get in for free but I hate that the Heard treats AZ tribes like we're obligated to help them to keep their lights on. I love that all the tribes in Arizona have been given the oppurtunity to share a piece of their culture yet I hate that the museum focuses on two tribes.  To my yelpers: Please realize that each tribe has it's own ways and unique culture. Open your heart and mind and take in the colorful culture I grew up in!

Dear Comedor Guadalajara,  I love you. I miss you. I wish the lightrail went to your doorstep so I could visit you more often!! This is my vote for best Mexican food in the city. Just north of the Salt River on Central Avenue, in what looks like a failing industrial part of the city just seconds south of Downtown Phoenix is this amazing, beautiful gem of a mexican restaurant.   With a large parking lot that is oftentimes full to the max, it can be a bit of a wait during peak eating hours. My best advice is to come during the off hours. I like 2PM on a saturday best. Everyone is bright and happy and the drinks are flowing (yes at 2PM, don't judge me!) and the salsa is SCORCHING hot! and the chips are yummy and the Beans N Chorizo Dip is incredible! If the salsa is too hot, ask for the mild and/or sour cream. The mild has no heat at all but is still flavorful and you can add as much of the hotter sauce to match your taste. It's delish. I like to order the plate that comes with green chilie relleno and a beef taco w/rice & Beans. My fave!   This is a good place for large parties, as most tables can accommodate 6 people. and some tables in the back can host even more than that. I've totally seen like 3 birthday parties going on at the same time back there! it was awesome! I scored some free cake! LOL!   The service is top notch with a super nice general manager who always manages to come by and say hi. I'm starting to think she recognizes me. I've seriously taken all of my friends to this place since rediscovering it two years ago.   To my yelpers, I say:  GO! Go now! Get that salsa and enjoy yourself! This place is awesome!

The first time I went to Karamba's it was for Pride. I went for after hours and it was amazing! I paid my $5 cover fee and went into what looked like an industrial style bar. There were tables being hung from the celing and there were also a backdoor to the outside patio as well as a the ladies restroom. When we went deeper into the club, the blue hued bar gave way to the deep red dance floor. There were tables for dancing on as well as a plush looking chill section.   The dance floor was PACKED with men grinding up on men, with women griding up on women and the ocassional straight couple peppered into the crowd as well as a few large groups of women dancing together. Oddly enough there's often a lot of straight women who go there with their bffs so they can dance in peace. There's some chairs and more hanging tables surrounding the dance floor.   Then there's the outside patio... there's a few water foutains and a ton of patio chairs, benches and tables. Sometimes it feels like the patio is where the real party is at!   Since that weekend, I've been a regular there. I'm sure if you venture there for afterhours some Friday or Saturday night you'll see yours truely tearing it up on the dance floor to some of the hottest hip-hop and reggeton around! If you do, pull me away from my friends and say hi! Hope to see ya'll there!

I rarely make the trip through the construction riddened Camelback Road and congested Central Avenue; but when I do make the trip, it's worth it!  Although the entrance of this place is on the opposite side of the bakery, my nose always finds it first! i don't know if it's the oh so purdy danishes and treats or the if it's the smell of all these things baking!! hmmmmmmmmmm...  either way, I can't leave without a cream puff the size of my fist! I always look at the deli but nothing has ever jumped out at me. I LOVE the cheese section! i want to sample and buy everything!! I've had caught myself daydreaming on how I could possibly steal one of the large wheels of REAL parmesano. The wheels are still turning on that one! But alas, I haven't the balls to pull of that great caper.   But I do have the balls to talk a little shop with the butchers who are always helpful and pretty funny once you repeat that one joke from the Chris Farley classic Black Sheep. I am always tempted to ditch the puff for a well marbled ribeye steak. However, my limited funds usually keeps me faithful to my sweet cream puff!   Onwards I go to the Italian "shoppe" that doesn't really speak to me. I've had it and I totally didn't write home about it. But the produce!! oh my gosh!!   My head whirls and spins about all the possiblities when I browse through the produce section. The organics that will spoil the second I bring it home... the tried and true pure produce that is bright and fragrant and in a good way! unlike some of the stuff that can be found in the more run down Food Citys in this town.   I really like being inspired by food to make even better food. And quality really plays a huge role in inspirational food. So go, and press your nose up on the bakery's glass display case showcasing it's decident sweet goods and dont' shoplift any cheese! Talk shop with the butchers and be inspired by all the products in the store. Even chat up an employee or two, inspiration loves company! Have fun, take your time and don't forget you wallet!!

*Sigh* Sushi makes me happy! Did you know?! It TOTALLY does!   Me and the queens made plans to have dinner somewhere - you know... like normal civilized people. All we knew was that I wanted sushi and that we wanted something awesome! After looking around on Yelp I chose to take the queens to CBNC...   "So where is this place?" "ummm... between 7th street &amp; 10th street off of Camel" "Okaaay? The left or right side of the road?" "I unno" "What do you MEAN you don't know? Haven't you been here before?!" "Ummm... no." "oh HELL to the no!" *the car then becomes filled with laughter*  We passed right by it and then flipped a bitch out of no where and it made us fear for our lives! and then screams filled the car. Soon we were parked infront of a soon to be Domino's Pizza and headed to the cafe of my lil yelp dreams... Only to be met with a 20 minute wait. We were then outside and I was left to fight off the queens who seriously considered going to Tokyo express instead! And then FINALLY our names were called and we were seated.  Our waitress was very nice. I want to say that it's the little touches that make CBNC great. The fresh  thick lemon wedge and fresh sprig of mint in the water pitchers. The way the servers are so friendly. She even complimented on my Japanese pronunciation! :) I didn't want to tell her the origin of my great accent...  watching Kill Bill a thousand times.   She helped us order sushi. I wanted nigiri and they didn't have it. I was disappointed but still went with her suggested crispy rolls and alaskan rolls. They were AMAZING! I loved the crunch and the flavor. With the soy sauce was scrumptious. We wanted to cancel our orders and just get more sushi! The alaskan was great as well. I loved it. Even the queen who never had sushi before liked it.   After devouring the sushi our food came. I ordered the beef soba noodle soup with tempura. It came with chicken instead. (boo!) but the tempura was perfect! (yay!) and I never had soba noodles, I usually get udon or chinese noodles. but I really liked the flavor and the fresh spniach that was wilting more and more as time went on. The slight flavor of the sliced green onions really made the dish something special. I loved it. I am just so sad that I couldn't finish it all! :(  One queen devoured the beef yakisoba noodles at once! I was able to sneak my chopsticks inbetween his bites and I got a taste. it was CRAZY yummy! each of the veggies had a great difinitive flavor and yet melded together amazingly. I loved it.   The other queen was pleasantly surprised at the taste of his Spicy beef rice plate. He couldn't finish his eaither but it was really. A lil too spicy for my tastes, but it was still awesome.   We then ordered a bottle of wine and a sip here and a sip there and we were all in heaven! Talking to our waitress about the Navajo sushi chef behind the sushi bar who she was trying to hook up with one of us... but we couldn't tell WHO she was trying to hook him up with! One of the queens or me?! Said chef never made it to our table - and it's just as well... we were in food heaven savoring our delights and wishing we had bigger stomachs to take it all in! I'm a big fan of this place now and am VOWING to take several people with me next time! :)

HA ha! Gay Denny's natch! lmao! This place is awesome!!  In the daytime you can see several groups of people thinking about their would-be purchases in the near by car dealerships. But in the night time...  late night, say... 2AM-ish... this place comes to LIFE! The patrons of the nearby clubs and bars conviene here to get their late night munchies on! There's some major people watching going on!!   Go and hang out, scope out the MUCH smaller late night menu and have fun. :)

I've only been to this place twice. But both experiences were pretty cool. I had fun, we went on a sunday night because we had a couple of people who were 18 - 21 with us and on that night... 21 and over get in for FREE!! whoo - hoo!! and the youngsters get in for like 5 bucks or so... i really can't remember when.   There's a 2 drink minimum i think but I didn't really drink anything. It was ackward dancing around their big ol' fence. It was like... keep the jail bait away!! ha ha ha!! but it was cool, I got to cross the dreaded fence and I even fell while doing so! I missed a step and face planted infront of a bunch of trannys. not cute.  It was alright though, it didn't have all the drama like straight clubs. I haven't been to another gay club, but I'd definatly go back. This time, I'll be sure to watch out for those steps!!

"How you goin' call us rude!?"  "Bitch because ya'll ARE!" "Good God Cheryl Miranda - you have GOT to quit calling people bitches!"  haha!! love it... Okay okay... that DIDN'T really happen... but it would've been SO cool if it did!! But what DID happen was...  there have been some small changes that make all the difference at this small store and for the most part, I really like it.   First thing, they have added things representative of other tribes to their stock. I have found Fresh Corn (LOVE THEM!!) Shirts that rep my tribe! (WHOO!) and they are also selling shirts that rep other tribes. The prices for the shirts aren't too bad $22 for one is about average.   Also, they have more shawls. I luuuuuuve shawls!! *purrs* Shawls are sometimes painted but usually applicaed (is that spelled right) shawls that are worn at Powwows by women. Some shawls can go for a couple of hundred dollars - and in the past, Drumbeats went for a little higher than $200 - I was have happy to see that they lowered their prices on shawls! :) I now send EVERYONE for them! :)  I didn't check their stock of pendletons, I believe their prices are still same but they do have more of a variety of them now - which is good. They now are expanding their stock of Pendleton Accessories!! I SO want a pendleton purse! :D Their jewelry is now more... colorful. which is great. I love color. :) and again - representative of different tribes.   Also - they have a couple of more racks of CDs for sale... so they have more of a variety and have extended their Chicken Scratch collection (SCORE!) lol.   The clerks still aren't the most outgoing, but atleast they are saying "thank you" at the end of every transaction now. And ONCE in a great while... they'll crack a smile. This a nice turn around for the store and I'm glad.   ALSO once in a while (I'm not sure how frequently) there is a small group of Navajo women who sell frybread. They have standard stand prices (nothing over $5 - I believe) and of course have mutton stew and grilled mutton with green chili frybread sandwiches. I like their frybread with red chili... it's really good. So maybe if you're lucky - you'll go when they're there... look for a neon green sign that says "frybread today" along 16tth street! :)

I've had one of my best dining experiences here!! I went with some friends one night and we had a grand old time! We laughed and had the cutest waiter EVER! The food was awesome! but the skinny minies I had with me couldn't finish their food! Ugh, nothing is more of a turn off than to see a girl who weighs 80 pounds soaking wet swearing she can't have another bite!   Anyway I digress!  I went another night another friend of mine. Him and I had an awesome time! We arrived and a table opened up quickly. We sat and were served well. Our waiter was very attentative, my friend thinks he hit on him though... but we always fight about which server is hitting on who! lol!   I ordered a SMALL cesar salad because my friend ordered a small soup. And they brought out this HUGE platter of salad! and the cesar dressing was so strong I couldn't eat it! I tried!! Really I did! it was like... stinging me! ouch! :'(   But I did order the chinese beef dish and that was INCREDIBLE! He ordered... hmmmm... I don't rememeber... but it must have been good he didn't complain. lol. We laughed and joked and talked and ate. We had too much fun. By the end of our meal he orded an pineapple upside down cheesecake! oh it was DEVINE!!!! I have never, EVER had a more better cheesecake ever! I will absolutely come back!   Our experience was amazing. simply amazing.

More posh than Posh, Capital Grille is the stuffy resturant that will totally get you laid. lol..., the food is good, the service is TOP notch. I cannot even begin to tell you!! ARGH! I'm getting ahead of myself... *deep breath* Let me begin...  It was Resturant Week and me and my neighbor Sharrita chose to come here for a couple of reasons: Meat and Creme Brulee. What ever homesick girl needs to feel better. :)  We entered the very clean and classy and dare i say it - swanky setting with their hostesses who ware blazers and they were very welcoming and were very glad to seat a yelper. (they asked how I heard about Resturant Week when I called for reservations) Our waiter - dang I can't remember his name! he was so attentative and had one of those table sweeper type thingies and he recommended I try the best drink of the night - the Stoli Doli. Fresh pineapple stewed with Stoli vodka for atleast a WEEK before it's dispensed for sweet drink lovers (like me) smooth, delicious and slightly sweet. I was in love.   We had standard salads, nothing to write yelp about. I had the Filet Mingon and she had this steak that was sliced in half (if I remember) it came with veggies, again nothing to really write yelp about but everything was so yummy. The steak was well rested and cooked perfectly. I was very impressed.    One slight issue: we saw creme brulee on the menu on  the resturant week's website but when we got to the resturant, it wasn't there - boo... but our ever amazing waiter worked it out for us! YAY!! Thank Goodness he did because it was insanely good.  If you want a place that is swank, seriously fancy (I'm from the rez okay - so this is crazy fancy in my world)  and has GREAT service and even better steak... this is the place for you! But you better have the cash to pay for it all! lol but if you have the money honey and a need to wine and dine then trust me sweetie Capital Grille has the time! Just call ahead for reservations!

Can't live here unless you love the hell out of this place!!  But if you have any sense of what good food is, you'll love this place anyway! Shooot... okay, dang - where do I start?!?!  I love their sauce! I am a sucker for killer sauce! It's freakin' awesome! I always order extra. Their tortillas are amazing!! They'd make an O'odham grandmother proud! I never leave there without a dozen... well, whatever's left of my dozen!   The ONLY thing that kinda caught me off guard about this place was that the last time I was there... there werent any  prices listed. There's usually hanging number signs indicating food prices, but nothing! I was scared they were going to charge me whatever they like. but the prices are crazy cheap! You've got to love it!

Ahhhh the Southside... one can find ANYTHING in the southside. That's one of my mottos in life btw. In southside of Phoenix, in the deep hood. In a neighboorhood where pricks who leave their cars on while running into Circle K for somehing quick will surely find their cars missing. and the car will probably be a block away or so - in order to teach the owner a lesson about stupidity... yes in this type of neighborhood, is the most brightly painted and smallest little closet posing as a flowershop.  It's really easy to miss, so stick with me. the ONLY way you can access this place is if you are heading east on Southern. It's impossible to enter this place if you're heading west. The traffic is too dense. You'll eaither cause an accident or get shot at for trying to make a left into this place. (jk... kinda) Its right behind McDonald's off of the south east corner of Central and Southern. it's elaboratly painted exterior depicts different Disney princesses and they usually have some brightly colored pinatas for sale hanging from their little porch.  When you enter the flower smell slaps your face. They have various plants and flowers and a very thick book of all the arrangements they have. NOW if you are shopping for a wedding... I recommend looking at the Quinceiera price book first!! This is because Quinceieras are usually more elaborate affairs (atleast on the southside) than weddings and also the Quinceiera prices are cheaper than the wedding prices! I was floored when I noticed that! Their books are so awesome! Because they also have packaged deals instead of pricing everything individually.   For my engagement party a couple of years ago, we got the small banquet package which were a dozen small arrangements of painted carnations, these small purple flowers, a couple of roses, mini purple calla lillies and baby's breath. They were all so purty and yes, I regret having the carnations painted. We should have loved them as nature made them.   One of the things I really liked is that ALL their fresh flowers come from this flower farm (is that the right wordding?) just outside of Buckeye and they only order what they need for that week. Its such a small place, they really don't have the storage space. and they do weekly pick-ups to the flower farm which means no large shipping costs for them and low prices for us!   SO if you're trying to go green for your wedding... what could be better?! A small locally owned mom and pop flower shop where the flowers are grown locally at crazy cheap prices! Also, their small storage space makes it hard for them to get big orders done in a few days notice... give atleast a week, just so you don't have to pay shipping fees. But this is only for really big orders, like a wedding or something. Also, they usually have an English speaking cashier, but there's been times when I went in for some flowers for a pageant and had to ask another customer for some help translating. You might want to bring in your own Spanish speaking translator, you'll be glad that you did.   to my yelpers: if you love small family owned businesses where the owners take pride in their work; if you're trying to go green for your next special occasion, but just don't know how; if you don't want to spend an arm & a leg for a bunch of flowers that will eventually die anway... and won't risk lives by turning left near a VERY busy intersection and like buildings painted like gingerbread houses with Disney Princess roomates.. than Kori & Anna's is just for you. I say go and enjoy that rich flower smell and remember to look at the Quinciera book first! Don't get your flowers painted (like I did!), bring some pictures to help them with some idea concepts and remember to include me on your invite list!

Like many institutions in Phoenix, you can't live here unless you LOVE Pete's!! I have seen and heard many a Phoenician defend their beloved Pete's as they would that other famous fast food mecca Carolina's.   I have lived in Phoenix my entire life and love Pete's and this is why I can stay! lol. From the street, it looks like an old take-out place that's all cute and retro... but noooooo... it's really an old take out place. and it produces some serious food! Whenever I go, I always peek at the mini factory of people dredging and frying all sorts of goodies. Shrimp (my fave), fish filets, hush puppies, corndogs, burritos and fries.   Once upon a time there used to be signs that read "NO TATAR SAUCE, SO DON'T EVEN ASK!" and all you had was Pete's patented red sauce that was part ketchup, part hot sauce but all lovely. Pete's sauce made everything taste better. It went well with the corndogs, the burritos, the fish, the shrimp, the fries and don't even get me started on the burgers! Sadly, after DECADES of refusing the Phoenix masses their precious tartar sauce and forcing them to enjoy Pete's sauce (for their own good) Pete's has caved and now offers Tartar sauce... and it sucks! So now many people won't even get the chance to even try the glorious Pete's sauce... cuz they want their old standard Tartar sauce! *sigh*   My fellow yelpers, if you haven't had Pete's yet - GO! And try the fish & shrimp combo and if your appetite is healthy - try a small burger and get extra sauce and enjoy!! It's worth it!! :)

This place is the real deal.   I know it's a horrible cliche` but when you enter an ethnic cuisine resturant and hear the customers AND the wait staff speaking the language of the cuisine ... you KNOW it's gonna be good!!   I've been going to El Mesquite for nearly 10 years. The servers have been there forever and I think are related to one another.   When you first enter you see some sterotypical posters on brightly painted walls and cutsey mexican pottery and plants. The resturant used to be only one room and has since expanded to two rooms. Another sign that a place is good! :) You are expected to seat yourself and will wait a minute or two before a bowl of paprika dusted toritilla chips that are served with TOXIC hot sauce!! Man it's killer!! but sooo good!! Just sprinkle some salt on it and ask for water and power through it!! Trust me! It'll get sweet after a bowl or two!! and when it does... MAN! that's good eatin!!  I like the two eggs with beans and tortillas with a side order of fried potatos! it's the best vegetarian breakfast on the south side! For lunch, a yummy burrito will do! And for dinner, the combination dinners are KING! The beans a lil runny, but when mixed with the rice, are AMAZING!! I like their iced tea, it's very dark, almost like sun tea. and the cups are huge!   And every meal is under $10! who can beat that?? Look out for the daily specials! they're rarely on the menu and are usually indulgences of a cook that gets bored easily! LOL! Today's was Pezole with fresh Pan.   One of the things that can be a little confusing is that the servers rarely give you a check. It's up to the diner to go to the back cashier register and pay. Usually, that's when the diner is told what the total is. I belive this is done as to not rush the patrons out of the resturant, which is something I appreciate.   When you're on the south side and want something a little off the beaten path and like leiserly meals served rocket fast and with love super hot suce all for under 10 bucks a pop this is TOTALLY the place for you!! Seat yourself, order water and sweat while u dare to enjoy the salsa! It'll only take a second as your food will be ready in a flash!

I'm still a fan of this place and stand by what I wrote before hand, but I would like to add is the fact that they have AMAZING chili relleno! I went there recently and had a new revelation, it was slightly soggy but still great. I hope you go and really try it out! it's worth the trip to the southside! :)

Once upon a time... back when Cher was just Cheryl... she used to come to Turk's all the time! When I was shorty it was so awesome! It was dark, and dank and they had pinball!! Whoo!! Huge sodas and deep fried EVERYTHING!  and then I stopped coming with my mom. Recently, I gave Turk's another spin or two and although it's cleaner and bright than what it used to be... it's still not as great.  Their menu is what you'd expect from a fish & chips greasy spoon, nothing is really grand or amazing. Just eh. They also have a variety of mexican-american hits. Which are decent.   I believe if Turk's were to move a lil east or a lil west they'd do better. With Poncho's and Pete's just a stone throw away it can't be easy to for them to stay in business. I miss the days when they made their own ketchup, tarter sauce and batter each and everyday. Now it's all prepackaged and mass produced for the the not so massive amounts of customers that frequent this place.  I'm told on weekdays during lunch they get flooded with calls... but besides lunch - it's pretty much dead. It's too bad, I wish they'd work on their food a lil more. Make it something special. But alas, it's just a lil bit below average. Maybe if they brought back the old arcade games?

I call this... "Ode To The Only Resturant I Truely Love"  My parents went to school with the owner's kids. They remember when it was a walk-up window take out place. Infact, when my father picked my mother and I up from the hospital after I was born, the FIRST stop they made on the way back to the rez was Poncho's!   One of the co-owners likes to laugh and say that she saw me before most of my family did! I went from being in a car seat gurgling as my relatives chomped on the best chips in town served with some awesome hot sauce that hasn't really changed since I was young. To being a little girl who always ordered the deep friend tortilla wrapped hot dogs with crinkle cut french fries and the BEST coldest ketchup I ever had!! To being a young woman who brought every single close friend I met while being away at school or through the native pageant circuit to enjoy the wonders that is "The Works".   My FAVORITE meal there is the cheese crisp as an appetizer, Combination #18 which is two tacos (i always order beef!), rice & beans. They have the best beans EVER!! And the rice is awesome too! I've had all the desserts on their menu and nothing really jumps out at me. I guess I still love the family tradition of going to the water & ice cream shop for thrifty ice cream before heading home!   I have had many experiences at this resturant. I've held my high school graduation party there; this resturant was the place where I signed a contract that made me the goodwill ambassador of my people for nearly a year; it was from their bar that I had my first LEGAL margarita on my 21st birthday, it was also the place where my then boyfriend got on one knee and asked me to marry him, and it was their waitresses who said "to HELL with him!!" when we ended our engagement.   It's a wonderful place to me, I like that I can go in and say "Hi Marty!" to their one time waitress who now manages the resturant. and have her yell, "HI CHERYL!!" Yes... that's right!! That's how long she has known me!! She can call me Cheryl and get away with it!! I also love the other long time co-owners/managers. There is one that always wants to buy a certain piece of jewelry off of me. And another who always laughes when I bring someone new in.   Poncho's is a place of regulars... LONG time regulars. and i think this is what every great restuant needs. Local, long time regulars who grow with the restuant. Who bring in new friends to enjoy the huge wonderful chimichangas or the Presidential Special and laugh over delicious enchiladas while a secret service agent (who kinda looks like leslie nealson if u ask me) painted on the wall watches on. While a bustling resturant does what it does best: offer homestyled, friendly, affordable and great food to it's old time regulars and it's about-to-become regulars.

After being stood up by my studio photographer for the LAST time (a very angry yelp review is brewing in my head as I type this) I was getting dehydrated and gouchy as I haven't had a bite to eat all day.   We decided to go to La Olmeca for lunch. This place used to be one my auntie's favorites, so I chose to give it a go... We entered a booth filled resturant that seemed frozen in the 80s or worse - the early 90s. Wood paneled walls, grimy pastel booths and chipped wooden tables can be looked over when the food is good... but the food just wasn't.  I had had the taco salad and was very disappointed. It was just meh. Taco Bell does a better jobat this lunch time favorite than these guys do. My mom got the cheese omlet special. She wasn't complaining, but I would be if I saw the brown underbelly of her overcooked omlet. Her potatos were straight from a bag. BUT the salsa was good.   Overall... skip this place. Even if you're in the area... a couple blocks south and you'll be at Poncho's... trust me you'll be waaay better off! I don't think I'll ever go back.

The food is AWESOME!! I looooove the Manapua and the Bulkogi or however it's spelled. It's the best!! the mac-potato salad is worth the trip alone!! I'm so glad my friend made me try it because I always go back when I'm on that side of town!! OH! and the fried wonton appetizers are the best too!! I love the sauce it comes with!! ALOHA!! :D

The lemonade was AWESOME!! There's sugar on the rim! :)   The food was good, I had the lousiana inspired dish, I can't remember the exact name. For dessert, I had the Strawberry Cheesecake. It was sooo yummy and AWESOMENESS!! :D   The service was good, he kept checking up on us. The only thing we didn't like was the tea. My cousin ordered regular iced tea and got passion-peach tea and it was NOT good!! *blech*   But other than that, it was a great place and I'd definatly go back!

I feel bad about giving this place two stars... really.  Last sunday, my mom and I were out on a power shopping spree at the pavillions when she said she wanted to go to Souper Salad, not wanting to i begruggingly agreed. We even dug through our back seat looking for their coupon in the sunday paper for a discount! We walked up and sat down and saw their DIRTY patio furniture... wtf?! Don't these people own a hose?! That was so dirty, I couldn't imagine trying to have a nice al fresco dining experience there! Luckily for me, it was the dirtiest part of the resturant.  We approached the door when a very loud man came and opened the door and exchanged pleasantries over and over again and was very happy to see us. Ummm... thanks? but can we atleast order our drinks first? He was a little happy. I unno - I was in a good mood, but I sorta just wanted to be left alone to eat. We got our salads and the greens were semi wilted and the cesar salad needed to be refilled but didn't :( and so I was left with some odd franken salad I threw together on my own. It wasn't that great - but that's my own doing.   Their pasta salads and cole slaw and some of their fixin's looked very old and unappetizing! I couldn't even imagine eating them! I wished they had potato salad or carrot slaw (is that the word?) and macaroni salad... it wasn't good. But things did lighten up when I came across the soups.  I loooove soups!! They are my salvation after a hard day. I cozied up to a lil bowl of tomato based soup with mini shell pasta and veggies, it was delish! So was the Veggie Beef soup. I wish it didn't have so much onion,but I'm not a big fan of onions. and their tacos were GOOOOOD... not write home and tell everyone about it good... but very good. They remind me of the kind of tacos you make at home, out of a box but not all craptastic like how they come out when I do it. I honestly liked it.   The cornbread was dry and my mom said her baked potato was too. The pizza looked too old to touch, so I unno about that one.   The service was another thing... the same man, who I'm assuming is the owner always kept talking. Even when my mom said something along the lines of just wanting to enjoy our meals and we thanked him for his hospitatlity. But damn... SHUT UP! I felt like he wanted to sit down and talk shop with us... but we weren't there to meet with him... we were there to talk with one another. But he always refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly. So he got to keeep a star.   To my fellow yelpers: if you're in the area and want fresh salads, this might not be the place for you... especially if you want to eat outside cafe style on nice clean patio furniture... but if you want a nice cozy bowl (or several like me) of soup and decent bread sticks then this place will hit the spot. You might need to shoo away the owner though in order to get some privacy and enjoy the people you arrive there with.

I don't know what I was expecting... I thought this would be a nice place for a nice breakfast... I was expecting frills... and boy was I disappoitned! My mom had breakfast there with a friend at the downtown location and loved it. So when we were on a shopping excursion to scottsdale this was the natural place to go for breakster.   We entered the CRAZY busy resturant that was all hustle and bustle... I was excited. We sat down and pour ourselves some water and ordered our food. We laughed at the silly egg-centric western themed paintings and waited for our food.   When it arrived it was a bit of a let down. The eggs benedict were mushy. I wish the english muffin was toasted more and the hollandaise was luke warm at best and became cold before I was done with my meal. It didn't help that the skillet they served it in was ice cold! I would have preferred it on a warm plate. The country potatos aren't anything great - but they aren't anything terrible eaither.  My mom loved her sun devils egg scramble with bell pepers and onions.   Everything really reminded me of Denny's and Ihop. Nothing was substantial, other than the rudeness of my fellow diners. One woman sat and picked at her teeth with her bare hands! Mouth WIDE open and everything!! Another man came in without shoes!! not even flip flops! WTF?! I thought this was Scottsdale?! The hell?!  To my fellow yelpers: it's nothing great, save your money and your time and try somewhere else.

Since i've moved to Tempe, I decided that I needed to find a new nail place. Taking a short ride around my new place, I found Plesant Nails which is down the road from where i now live. That's pretty cool - I can just walk there.   I have been going there since Mid-August. I feel I have a very good idea of how this place is.   Pros  -Ahn is awesome! She's been doing nails for over 10 years. She's very good at drawing designs. Even the crazy ones that I found online. I get tons of compliments everywhere I go.  -Chad gives a good pedicure, but sometimes I want to just relax and unwhind and read magazines or the occasional text book, but he talks to me throughout the entire pedicure. I guess its okay, atleast he's funny! -They have relaxing music playing in the background and large plasmas playing movies on mute with subtitles. They are more than fine with stopping the music and turning up the sound on the tv if u want them to.  -Their massaging chairs are awesome! If I had the room, I'd totally buy one! -Their lifegel uv gel product is the BEST overlay that I have every ever EVER used. I've had a couple of cracks but Anh has always been able to fix them. They are expen$ive but if you have weak nails like me, its worth it.  CONS -After years of traditional dancing from my tribe, I've developed some serious calluses on my feet, especially my heels after my pedicure, I still find myself watching tv while taking a ped egg to my heels on week nights. And that's AFTER the sugar scrub and the callus removal treatment. It often makes me want to skip the pedi entirely. -My appointments can last HOURS!! Its not unusal for me to spend 2 hours at the nail shop. Once, I was there for 4 hours! I have to schedule my appointments for days when I don't have class.  -My average bill is from $80-$120 depending on how elaborate my designs are. I've never spent this much on fills, designs, pedi w/sugar scrub & designs on the big toes! -And finally the ultimate con. They nickel and dimed me. What i mean is, they DO have a menu (its under the clipboard u sign when u walk in) however, when I first went in, they didn't tell me about it. They just said for me to tell them what i wanted and they'd make it happen. Me, not knowing any better said a gel overlay with polish and designs and also a pedicure with polish and designs on the big toes. At the end of the day, I spent over $140. I am always explained my charges at the end of the appointment, however - I'm charged for every single service. I didn't mind - per se until I saw the menu. Everything that i got comprises into two bundles that are significantly cheaper (about $20 less) than what I've been charged for for months now. They never told me about the bundles and have discouraged me from reading the menu this entire time. I finally figured out why!   With everything added up, i don't know what to think. I love their work - I can TALK to them and we've shared laughs and I love that they are a family business. Its a clean store front and I get nothing but compliments on the quality of my nails.  However, the marathon appointments are hard to make time for in my schedule and the fact that they overcharged me is hard to deal with.   I am a fan, that's why I gave the 4 stars. However, they are NOT as good as it gets! I say, if you decide to go READ the menu and be sure you're not over charged for your services. Know that they take their time and you should plan accordingly or perhaps tell them how much time you have to spend there. But know that your nails are going to be more than pleasant, they are going to be beautiful!

I loved the salsa with tons of cilantro! I need to try the menudo sometime soon!!   Nice, COOL, clean taquieria with a nice seating area. No cheap o booths! lovez it. and it's open 24 hours!! So if you're in the hood and its late... waaaay late... forget the bell and head to Rivas!!

I first came here as a part of a class trip. We all enjoyed ourselves and feasted on the new and different cuisne that is Thai food. It was here that I first met and fell inlove with Pad Thai.   It was so wonderfully prepared and delicious. I decided I needed to come back someday for more. And when that day finally came, I needed the navagator feature on my cell phone to get there! This place is really hard to find! so keep your eyes peeled and know that's in the depths of a strip mall.   The pad thai was just as good as I remembered it. However, they did serve me bad shrimp. It even smelled bad! I didn't want to eat it. But I took it home to be polite. The deserts are good as well. The coconut ice cream topped with peanuts is surprising to say the least!   I say, go! but take a map! Or a navagator if you have it. And be ready to be doted on, but don't expect any free refils on your soda! (boo!) and have a nice time with some nice people eating great authentic food. It was truely a great experience! :)

My search for a new nail salon is OVER!! Thank goodness almighty, I've found the place for me! Okay, the decor isn't all ghetto like Nails Too and it isn't all pretty and sleek like Pleasant Nails. It's juuuust right!   for under $40 I get my pedi on (with an extra sea salt scrub) AND my fills with polish. I love my polish, I'm going through a very simple and pink nail polish phase.   The pedis are awesome with the technicians taking extra care to get all the dead skin off (gross I know) and there's plenty of magazines and of course a tv that's always on mute with closed caption.  The minuses are... well I can't think of any... ummm... the fish tank could be better maintained? lol... gun to the head, seriously. lol.   Overall, I love this place. I go often, infact, I want to go tomorrow, I SERIOUSLY need some fills. Hope to see you there!

One hot Arizona evening my mom and I were wondering around Tempe looking for decorations for a float for an upcoming parade when we happened upon several restuants in a row... not knowing where to go, the only thing my mom could say was "Anywhere but Manuel's!" I started to read off the different signs and she said, oh! let's try Rice King... ummm... sure I said.   We entered the DESERTED dining room around 5:30 PM, in the middle of what normally is the dinner time rush... but not a soul in sight - NOT a good sign! We went through their mini gauntlet of fake plants and approached the counter infront of a VERY old sign displaying their menu. Straight out the 80s. Old worn out photos of their signature dishes were warped and dingy looking. I honestly had a positive outlook, I was hoping for the best and gladly ordered the Lemon Chicken and my mom ordered the Cashew Nut Chicken from the nice Chinese man who ran the place.  We paid our $18 for our meals, got our drinks and sat down. I would like to say that Rice King's food is where the old meets the new. Not old traditions meet new techniques and fresh ingredients... more like... old ingredients meet old techniques drenched in newly thinned out sauce. *shudders*   First came our egg drop soup served in a small styraphone cup. It was lukewarm... like a single serving of incubation soup. It had a decent flavor but when I bit into one pea... it was disgusting! I couldn't take it! It tasted like the once frozen pea had freezer burn! My mom quit eating hers after two bites and I got through it all except for the peas.  Next came our meals. Check the pictures for how the looked... it was a big plate of beige. The Lemon chicken would have been decent but the sauce was old and gloopy and not very hot. The chicken itself was an old filet but the batter was nice and light and crispy. I started to just eat the crispy skin. The rice was hardening and hosted more of the freezer burned peas. It was slightly peppery again, would have been good if it were freshly made. The eggroll was the best part of the meal... if only it were larger than my thumb! The sweet & sour sauce it came with was watered down so much it was literally flavorless. However it did come with some friend wontons which gave a nice crunch to things.   The cashier was friendly, which earned them another star. But man, the food was baaaad. We only finished it because we were starving! When we left we wished we had gone to Manuel's after all!

I don't care what ANYONE says... one friggin' successful season DOES NOT undo two decades of the most crap-tasticly awful football!! Yeah, yeah, yeah - I'm glad they're actually going to go but I'm not that thrilled... you see, their recent confrence win means, I lost a 10 year old bet! booo!!! But oh well... I guess it was a lil stupid of me to think that they'd never make it to the superbowl in my lifetime.   So they're going to the big Bowl... whoo hoo... i guess... but dude, seriously... where the HELL was this LAST YEAR?!?! Yeah... last year!! When the superbowl was in ARIZONA!! DUH!! How awesome would that have been?! AZ goes to the superbowl in AZ!! Talk about economical boost! But alas, the big game is all the way in Tampa Bay... I unno if many of the cardinal fans will be making it, but for a once in a lifetime event like this... you never know.  even though I HATE football... and I am comfortable with hating the Cardinals and decades long suckfest.... it's nice to see the ultimate underdogs finally have their day. Sure they suck, sure they've been the worst team in history... but like so many things in America... We are about to experience a change. Now... if I can only allude my old high school bookie for a few weeks until I have enough to make good on my bet!!

I gotta give this place 5 stars because well... this is MY rez! :D  The Sheraton Wild Horse Pass is located on the Gila River Indian Community which is home to me! Cher T.! :D I really do like this place. I've been there maaaaany times performing or just looking about. I like the traditional art work on display outside the ball rooms as well as all the photography and paintings in the hallways.  On the celing of the two story lobby, is a mural of our creation story and ways of life. I hope you like it.  I have never eaten at any of WHP's resturants, but let me tell you... Kai is CRAZY expensive!! I've heard of ppl paying nearly $100 a head! that's insane to me! But hey, if you have the money honey... Kai totally has the time! Also another note in Kai, their food is a nice homage to traditional O'odham food, but it's not all the way there... there's tthings on that menu that some O'odham won't eat. Like Buffalo. But I'm told its a great fancy-shmancy place to go when u want to get laid... or save ur marriage as one councilmen joked.  I have no idea what non-community members pay for rooms there, but the rate has prolly went up since it hosted the NY Giants during this past super bowl. But either way... if you've got the dougn to spend on a nice place, this is it and I'm told the water slide kicks ASS!! Or if you're at the casino and am waaay tired of fighting old ppl for the last piece of fried chicken at the casino buffet and just want something nice and quiet and you just hit it big at the blackjack table... then take the soonest boat and treat yourself to a meal at the resort!

WHOOOOOOOOOWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!! that's some damned good fried chicken!  hahaha!! Forreally for real though... Ugh.... *Insert Homer Simpson-esque gargling sound here!*   My cousin and I were spent the weekend being hermits and I got tired of it and offered her some LoLo's, never one to turn down a free meal, she happily said yes. We brought my mom along and were Lo-Lo's bound.  When we got there I saw the lil tent and mini bar of doom. I've read the many reviews warning me about Lo-Lo's 40+ minute wait... but seeing no one standing in the way of the misting fan, we decided to trudge on in... and we were SO lucky to find more empty tables than filled. We sat down in the nice cool mustered colored room, lined with Framed pictures depitcing the Jazz Era...   We were quickly brought menus and we ordered a round of tea... I had the Half sweet & Half unsweetened tea... my cousin chose the sweetened tea and my mom the chose the unsweetened tea. When the HUGE mason jars hit the table they were excited! I held my own taste test and concluded that Yelpers are always right and that the half & half rules.   Our waitress was nice enough to explain some of the dishes to us. We ordered and waited a lil while... not as long as I did the first time I went. While we waited and talked the rest of the tables around us quickly filled and we considered ourself fortunate to have arrived when we did. I told them of the warnings about going to Lo-Lo's after church on Sunday... Expect an hour long wait! They whistled and said that it couldn't be that good...   and then the food arrived...  It was better than I remember it! i chose the Soul-food platter which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken and your choice of two sides... I chose a waffle and smothered potatos and a large muffin type hunk of cornbread. My mom ordered the same thing but chose potato salad & yams as her sides. My cousin got a pair of drumsticks with a waffle.   We were all silent for a good five minutes. When we finally went up for air. My mom couldn't believe how good her yams were. She looked like she wanted to cry! lol... and she said the potato salad was great and that the chicken was EXACTLY what she wanted!!  My cousin was inlove with the chrunchy-type crispness salty sweetness of the chicken & Waffle combination. and I, I was about to DRINK my smothered potatos, which are nothing but simply boiled potatos swimming in this basil-thyme(?) flavored chicken gravy that was sent here from heaven!! IT was the BEST gravy I EVER EVER tasted!! I was happily taking a bite of chicken with a bite of waffle and then followed it with a nice perfect smothered chunk of potato... when... when... it was GONE!! ARGGHHH!! When are they going to invent never empty bowls?!?! huh?! WHEN?!  There was nothing but small micro bits of potato swimming in the most amazing grazy... and all I had was a fork... but there... was still some left... and not a spoon in sight, but I could pick up the lil mini bowl....   "DON'T EVEN think about it!" My mom scolded me while reading my thoughts  DANG!   I reached a happy medium when I got smart and skewerd a nice piece of chicken and dunked it in the gravy and I was SO back in business!! :D whoo hoo!! It was heaven. pure heaven.   I know very few things about heaven... I know O'odham Cumbia in Heaven... and I know Lo-Lo's gravy is poured from FOUNTAINS in heaven!! haha....   Meanwhile - back on Earth, we devoured our food. I honestly thought I was going to have tons leftover for my lunch the next day... my mom thought the same... no such luck for any of us! My mom was in extacy over her yams that she asked for their recipe... the waitress said she'd ask and quickly came back with: brown sugar, cinnamon & vanilla - boiled and NOT baked... and that's it. And PLEASE let me tell ya'll - she has NEVER ever done that with me before... this woman doesn't like ANYTHING/BODY... and that day, she fell in love with those yams! (Where's my calender?!)  We were laughing and talking about how good the lemonade is (oh yeah - when I needed a refil, I just asked for some lemonade instead of more tea, she did it no problem... she also did the same for my cousin who tried the red kool-aid) and how great the food was when I got a call from a good friend of mine. I told him where I was when he made fun of me and told me to clog my artaries... I made a face and asked him in a rather rude tone if he's ever been to Lo-Lo's, he said no. And then I told him... he'll never get how little I care about my artieries when I'm here until he tries it for himself! Only until you try it do you get how amazing it is...  So simple, so devine. So yummy, so Lo-Lo's.

In all honesty, I don't really own very many items from this store!  But I love to go!! I dig going and checking out all the clothes! some of their stuff is WAY to cutting edge for me!! I'm a nice girl! :P ha ha ha!! but for eal, I'm not that edgy or goth. But I LOOOVE their shoes. I still have a couple of pairs! :) I also like the pop culture themed accesories. the odd button or purse gadget or gizmo, it's pretty cool.   It always seems to be the Hot Topic for big girls! ha ha! If you are a size 12 to 26 and love hot trendy "throw away" clothes and/or gothic clothing, this is totally the place for you!! I FULL-HEARTIDLY (was that spelled right??) recommend the Balconette bra!! They make the trip worth it!!   I love the idea behind Torrid, you CAN be sexy and express yourself for a nice price no matter what ur size!!

One day me and the sis and the cuz were wondering around central phoenix like we usually do... not knowing where to go, I was feeling Pizza A Metro, but the cuz wanted a burger she could sink her teeth into... I was drawing a serious blank when the sis shouted, "ORIGIONAL HAMBURGER WORKS!" ARR?? *lil puppy ears raise up in a questioning manner*  She quickly drove us there and it was adjacent to Phoenix College and had a cool Encanto vibe... I dug it. It's right next to this paint ur own ceramic pottery place that seemed so cool! When we entered the works...  It is HUGE on the inside! there are crazy signs from the 40s and 50s and traffic lights and the coolest copper topped tables. I totally dug it's cavernous feel. Ahhh... and the smell!! of fresh cooking meat!! WHOO HOO!!  We had to go through a lil line that reminded me of Castles n Coasters and some of the older Taco Bells... hmmm not so cute. but I can see how it could be necessary... I can just imagine how busy this place gets at lunch time with the college just RIGHT over there!   Their burgers sounded pretty average... terriyaki burger, bacon cheese burgers - there's no crazy toppings that don't make sense like some places... just straight up great burger classics. but WHAT is different about the way the menu looked was that they had a retirement burger?! WTF?? it comes with a boat and a car! sweet!! the perfect sides!! I bet burgers totally taste better on a boat!! Now if only I could get a $1,000,000 to find out if it's true!! But since I couldn't afford the retirement burger, I opted for a 1/2lb patty topped with bacon and cheese. The sis chose a side order of half zucchini & onion rings and the cuz threw it DOWN that night yo!! TWO half pound patties with cheese! I'm not cool enough to hang with that! :(  We went around the corner, through the labrynth and paid we told the chick our name and got our cups, the soda fountain area is so cool! I love the Iced Tea section, there were many options to choose from! Sweetened black tea and green tea, raspberry and unsweetened tea... lovesit! and my sister's happy to see Red Creme soda can be found there too!   When the food was ready I walked up to the wagon 'o toppings and had FUN! I buried my burger with mounds of lettuce, mayo, ketchup and some tomatos and tons of pickles... and when i was all done... I could barely fit it in my mouth! But somehow i managed and it was soo yummy!! Freshy cooked over a fire, it was so great! I haven't had such a good burger in a long time!  my ONLY complaint is that I wasn't sure about the daily meal deals... I didn't see it until the last second! and that the sides are so SMALL!! HUGE ass burgers... lil baby sides! WTF?! and for almost as much as a burger?!?! NOT COOL!!  But seriously, the people are cool and so are the other diners, there were tons of yummy firemen when I we went! Also, the attached bar looks like an awesome place to get drunk in!! It's totally on the list of places to try out! I really enjoyed myself here and got crazy full off of my huge burger and baby side! I still can't believe the cuz could handle a large double burger!! Craziness!! I'll definately be back with more in tow!  To my yelpers: i say go!! and try the burgers and marvel at the round lil circles of bacon atop of a perfectly charred burger! Load up on the toppings (like I did) and try not to bitch about the small sides (like I did) and try each of different types of tea (like I did) and maybe even a beer or two and don't ask a fireman if you can see their hose... (like I did) cuz they just MIGHT! but BOOO!!! They took me out to their truck instead of getting out of their trunks!!

Honestly, not a fan.   The dance floor is never full, the music is always ten minutes behind the times. The drinks are okay. On 2-4-1 nights, can be a Godsend. but it's just meh. A lot of dirty looks if you're a straight girl. no love for the hags here. Blah. However, the Taco Truck outside is AH-MAZING!! but that's the only highlight.

Ahhhh Feast Day....   They're awesome. I wish I could bring all you yelpers to my village's feast day.... it's like... christmas in the early fall except the only presants aren't left under the tree but instead are scooped by 60 year old O'odham grandmothers who have been cooking since childhood and only know unwritten recipes that lack measurement, volumetric or otherwise.   I could describe to you the food we eat on San Juan's Day (in my village) or Saint Frances Day (Ak-Chin & Salt River)... but if you want a taste of what it's like to line up and part take in the ceremonial meal... head on down to the Fry Bread House.  The BEST way to experience this would be to go and order a bowl red chili stew with side order of frybread and if you're interested a lil baby bowl of beans. and then just wait. Dip and scoop the bread in the stew and enjoy. There's NOTHING better than moistening the light and crispy bread into the broth of the stew. It's heaven!

I have heard about this palce before from some online... friends.... yeah, friends! *wink, wink* and they all claimed it was a nice spot to go and see the latest in fetish gear and whatnot.  So I went and took a couple of friends and it was pretty awesome, I must admit! :) We went and tried on a few things and I was really surprised to see corsets and stuff in MY size!! I was jumping for joy as I purchased my totally cute denim corset with matching boyshort! :)   We even found one for my male friend to wear to an upcoming event! :) The boots were KILLER!! OMG! I WANTED ALL OF THEM!! But alas, I didn't have the money for them all. BUT they can special order boots and are pretty cool about thing, so yeah - I'd definiatly go back the next time I'm hankering for a new nighte or corset of doom! }:D

It's nitty, it's gritty, the food is AWESOME and the clientile & staff is straight hood! It's in the middle of the REAL south side of Phoenix right off of Central & Baseline. It's crazy awesome. At first glance ifs pretty colorful and kind of cool, if it were wiped down with rags dampened with clorox! LOL!   This is TOTALLY my kind of place!! Its straight hood! It's in a strip mall and is between a Chinese food place and a day labor place. It's kind of crazy there. If you're dining after dark I FULLY recommend ordering things to go because there's been shootings there before. Two that I know of, but YO she shouldn't have looked at her like that! GAH! JK!   There are a few retro video games there and a couple of pool tables and there's also a bar in the back! (yay!!) but the bar scene isn't that great. But the booze is cheap! (double yay!)  Like all Long Wongs, this place is known for their hot wings which are made fast, cheap & delicious! their suicide wings are the owner's pride and joy and trust me... they're HOTT!! I once downed an entire pitcher of Margaritas while scarfing on a dozen trying to win a bet. And at the end of the night, I prevailed while holding my head up HIGH before I crashed down to the floor cuz I was trashed!   They have the usual greasy spoon food and it's all at fair prices. They also have bbq and solid dinners. Like speghetti or steak dinners. I'm a huge fan of their fried zucchini.   This place is very rough around the edges but it's still the small neighboor place that it was intended to be. Where those in know which side of the menu to order from. Where drunks get trashed in the back room bar. Where hustlers get gullable rez girls (like me) to bet them $20 a ball at some 8ball. where sometimes fights break out - but it's not a terrible thing. I don't know how to explain it... Its home. It's rough, it's the hood but the people are real. There is NO pretention in this place. It's straight up good food at straight up good prices. You can have a great time here - I have had many... just keep an eye on your purse.

Ummm... the name of this place is mispelled. It's Feliz! As in Happy Taco! If you're from the South side this is what you'll call Taco Feliz...  Happy Taco has been around for quite sometime and has been the best part of my late night excusions. My favorite dishes here is the Chorizo, egg & potato burrito. Also the rolled tacos are awesome! as are the regular tacos with rice & beans combination.   They have HUGE sodas and very decent prices. During "normal" hours, they will always have an english speaking attendant - they may have a crazy thick accent, but they understand what you're saying. But sometimes in the middle of the night many things can get lost in translation. I love this place and their menudo is KILLER!

A friend and I tried here the other day and i wasn't impressed. I thought it was too dark and the service was all out of whack especially considering the fact that the place was practically empty.  The hostess and the runner seemed to be frenimies and it was a lil ackward! We sat down and looked at the unnecessarily complicated menu... nothing really outstanding. The usual overprices Japanese-y selection with the occasional hit of Hawaiian... but it was just Americanized Japanese cuisine. I've had Hawaiian food, its wonderful... what the heck was this?   The people there kept giving us the once over and threw their nose in the air... just to get a lil revenge, we put our Louis Vuitton and Tiffany bags on the table and went over our recent purchases (those reviews coming soon!) and the looks of snobby angst turned to jealously like THAT! lol... I could see this attitude if it were some high priced exclusive resturant that required a jacket for dinner serivce... but a freakin' wanna-be Hawaiian that's in a MALL?!? Are you serious?! Ugh Scottsdale! *eye roll*  I had the rainbow roll and the dumplings, they were good, decent. No serious complaints, but still not great and stellar. I don't think I'll go back and sit in the resturant. I think I'll go to my local sushi place down the way from my place. Same food, same quality, different price! To my yelpers I say: skip it, you're not missing much... and though it may be Scottsdale, do you REALLY expect to find a good meal at a freakin' mall??

In a sentance: Four Peaks is DEFINATLY something to write Yelp about! From the moment I realized that there were more reviews about this place than I'd care to read in one sitting, I knew this was going to be good!! I realized it was going to be fantastic when i pulled up with my friend Darius and we had a hard time finding a parking spot at 3pm. We met a friend for lunch and the place was laid back, chill, clean, cozy and yet modern - perfect.   I had the French Dip, thinly sliced roast beef on a nice hogie bun. Everything was good not too salty not too greasy, loved it! Darius got the Fish N Chips and it was incredible!! Crispy batter dipped big pieces of fish, iot was crispy and crunchy but soft and delightful on the inside. The chips were also batter dipped and had great flavor. I was in love! this is my best recommendation for a meal at Four Peaks!  To my yelpers i say: there is limited parking, so when you pull up and see nothing but cars lining the street, do NOT be alarmed! there will be a table available! Another thing, get the fish n chips! It's duh-vine!

I freakin' love this place!!  Reading the other reviews it makes me laugh because well... i guess I AM their target audience!!   I have taken quite a few of my friends to this spot and it's always good fun. The music is a little loud for my taste and it's weird when u get a good vibe going and are challenging your friends to a smoke-ring-off and then all of a sudden you're puffing away to gangsta rap! it's like... HUH? When did Biggie walk though the door??   But whatev', u just keep getting ur caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland on and talk with your friends. But it's real what someone else said... u totally don't make friends there! It's hard when everyone's stoned and or trying to hook up with one another. But word on the people watching, for REAL!!   As far as the seeshas go, I dig the mixed fruit and the apple flavors. It's pretty awesome. I love the taste and flavor and the fact that it's a LOT smoother than cigarettes.   If you do decide to go, try some of the food... you might be surprised. Bring your ID cuz these ppl card! Take some friends and cover the hose when ur not smoking... its just polite! :P

I MUST talk about the food at this place!!  Okay, it was only recently that I decided to really try their food. and it was soo yummy! One time, I had a gyro and a seesh thoola (is that spelled right?) The second sandwich was a grilled chicken dish wrapped in a pita. it was so good! Their olive oil is quite good. The gyro was good too - a little greasy for my liking, but still yummy.   Another time I went - i went with a couple of friends and we brought it down! We had a kebab combination. My friend had just a chicken kebab and I had a lamb kebab and the sheeh thoola combo and my other friend had just the lamb. It came with salad and hummus and pita as well as our entrees and rice and this one side dish of feta cheese, tomatos and i think sage? I didn't get to eat it because my friend ate it all! damn her!   The hummus and pita was DELICOUS! and the rice was amazing. The kebabs were a little dry - I gotta admit but everything was good. I was really surprised. I thought it wasn't going to be that great. I wish we sat at a table becuase eating in their lil booths with just pillows on the floor was not very easy. We all got leg cramps that night.   But seriously - the service is SHIT! There's this guy who is their waiter - if you're not a FEMALE under 25 and WHITE and BLONDE and a size ZERO and have HUGE tits... he does NOT give a shit about you! and that's REAL! I am SO not lying!! I've have been to this establishment atleast a dozen times and everytime - the story's the same. We go up and order our hookah... this employee takes the order is seems rather pissed to do so. I give him my ID and credit card and sit down with a couple of menus.  SEVERAL minutes later, our hooka comes and then we order our drinks and another quarter hour later our drinks come and then he seems CRAZY annoyed that we actually want food. I never care and just order anyway. There's been a couple of times when my friends wanted to eat somewhere else because of this guy's attitude. We order anyway. He reluctantly takes our order. We sit and wait... and wait... and wait... I search the room for him and there he is... standing over some girl's clevage as she giggles and twirls her hair. and FINALLY (one time 40 minutes later) we get our food. a-hole supreme usually plops our plates down and gives us more coles and is GONE. We never get refils on our drinks unless we beg another employee who seems like he's 15 years old.  When we're done - we flag him over from yet another table where he's now hovering over a different cleavage since cleavage number 1 has left. and he clears the tables and leaves us yet again. Until we're done smoking and then finally go to the register to pay. When i think about it... the service really does suck! but the food is so good and so is the hookah. I've come close to telling off the waiter of the year - but the tobacco and food always calm me down. :P

I REALLY don't know how to rate this place... I'm giving it two stars because I seriously HAVE experienced better. Let me explain.  My friend and I, after wandering around for nearly an hour searching for somewhere to eat, our quest ended (or atleast we THOUGHT it was going to end) at Lo Cascio's. We entered a very quaint and fancier than it really ought to be little italian place. There was a young couple, a middle aged couple and a three top already enjoying their meals. We sat down and tried to figure out what to order.  The service was so-so. Nothing great. but we ordered anyway, I ordered the gnocci with tomato sauce and sausage. My friend ordered the speghetti and meatballs. We had different soups before our meal and were served the soups along with our teas.  My bean and pasta soup... was not good. It was seriously a bowl of pinto beans with some pasta in it. No spices, no veggies... nothing but pinto beans and baby macaroni. wtf?? My friend's minastrone (yeah I know it's mispelled!) wasn't that great eaither. No complaints, but no rave reviews eaither. We had hoped the entrees were going to be better when...  "What the HELL do you mean you won't serve me another drink?!?!"  A shout from the middle aged man who sat with (I'm assuming was his date) a small petite blonde woman. The server tried her best to get the man to settle down, the more she tried to calm him down - the angrier the bastard got. He got to the point where he was yelling and screaming at her and even stood up and got in her face.  the male busser who served us our teas, watched while hiding behind a drink station along with one of the cooks. Another male. We watched in sympathy as the poor waitress was being bullied by this guy... it took EVERYTHING for me NOT to get up and kick this guy's ass!  "Remember where you are!! This is scottsdale! If the cops show up, they're gonna throw us BOTH in!! and let his ass go free!!" was the words I needed to hear... seriously. I wish Scottsdale Police would quit being so racist.   Finally when he had his face in hers, I said fuck it.  "WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?!" I asked to the entire room. The busser came and he said that the three-top next to us were the OWNERS!! An elderly woman and her husband and brother... owned the damned resturant and were now staring into their soups and drinks trying to pretend the entire thing wasn't happening. No body was going to defend this poor girl. I started to get up, fuck it TAKE ME TO JAIL!  Yes... I really do get that hood. I'm sorry - I'm not your average yelper... I have and will probably cut a bitch (again).   and FINALLY the elderly woman, with her neckbrace and casted arm (seriously! I'm not lying) got up and tried her best to calm the man down. I was appaulled. I never seen such an outburst like that since... the LAST time I ate in Scottsdale! (haha! I just realized that!) But even then, the manager intercepted right away and took care of the rowdy customer... in this case, I really think the owners would have let this guy get violent with her. I know violent men and I know how they work... and this guy was on the edge.   we called the busser aside and asked for our check for the food that we were served and not the food we ordered. They gave it to us along with a coupon for 20% our next visit. I vowed to give this place another try.  Seriously, it wasn't their fault. No one WANTED this guy to become a jerk. He chose that and sometimes it's not right to fault a restuant on the behaviors of its customers. and that guy was loaded! and obviously had one too many, the waitress was just doing her job. but it was NOT okay for the owners to let her get abused like that... EVER!  I have even seen executive chefs come out of the kitchen and calmed customers down (ANOTHER time I dined in Scottsdale! haha!! errrm... I'm noticing a theme!) but I never seen a bunch of scared ass pussies look the other way like that. so for that, this place loses major stars.

Walking down Mill Ave one can see many signs and lunch specials calling your name. A friend and I wanting lunch between classes, we hopped off the orbit and came upon MBFGR and its awsome $5 pita lunch special and chose to give it a try.  I had the Gyro pita lunch that came with a salad or fries. My friend had the Grilled Chicken Pita, we both loved our lunches. the servers didn't mind us sitting around for over an hour gossiping and laughing around about God knows what. They kept our sodas topped off and our food was great! The salad could use another kalamata olive and my gyro was so stuffed I wished I had a second pita! It was so yummy, we were in love and I will TOTALLY be back soon!!!

Me and the Madre went here a couple of weeks ago looking for a good place to eat in Mesa... we happened upon Susie's. We entered through their crazy awesome door that was HUGE! and was seated quickly. the menu was okay looking, lots of pictures... that's kind of a turn off for me. blah. Menus with pictures *shudder* anyway, the food was drab and not worth the fuss. The decor was drap also and everything needed to be disenfected. or atleast hosed down. The wallpaper and the countless tiles are all from the 70s. I didn't hate this place, but I won't be back unless I'm promised a VERY strong margarita.

If you're ever in Tempe and need some fabric, come to this place!!  Chances are you'll see me throwing bolts of satin or cotton around and chatting with the staff who I've gotten to know over the years.   There's some real gems here. Don't be fooled by the evap coolers and the oldish register. New and hard to find fabrics are here. I'm often the envy of all my designer friends because I find the neatest stuff and for CHEAP!   Pay attention to the signs, they will lead you to what you're looking for, you may have to dig, there are literally piles of fabric in some bins. And neatly arranged fabric bolts in other places. There's also not very many notions, but we come here for fabric! Roll up your sleeves and see what gem you unearth in this fabric store from the fashion gods!   If you see me, say hi and remember that you can only by the full or half yard and respect the LINE!!

The mad house that started it all!! I was researching Last Chance in 2007 when I came upon a lil website called Yelp.com... awww... *tear!*  I have gone to Last Chance several times and I love it more and more each time I go... Cuz you see... I'm the type of person who loves to fight for things at a store... I'm the one who will shove you "accidentily" while reaching for that last clearence sweater on Black Friday in the middle of a jam packed wal-mart at 5am while still full of turkey and gravy. But sometimes I miss the excitment of hunting and gathering goods for a low low price... and Last Chance fulfills my hunting needs.  Cuz you see, i know how to shoot and gun and all - but hunting game just doesn't do it for me. There's nothing like diving for the last pair of shoes and seeing a member of the e-bay mafia dive for it too... but then I block by saying, something like "OH! that Coach bag is only eighty DOLLARS?!?!" and then I snatch the shoes of my dreams as the mafia member falls for my diversion... muhahaaahaahahaha!!  And I also like trying on clothes over my regular clothes because if it can fit over my other blouse then it'll surely fit... seems like good logic to me... and I also like hissing at my fellow huntresses when they attempt to reach for something that's mine!! and nothing compares to the small small price I have to pay for some great clothes that I rarely wear... becuase well... it's what they always say... the hunt is better than the catch.   Oh well... I still love Last Chance it's my Black Friday any day of the week. But be advised my fellow yelpers, BE PREPARED! I suggest wearing some should pads and steel toe shoes while shopping at this place!! trust me, you'll thank me later!

Full... so... full!!  It was over 36 hours ago that I had Famous Dave's BBQ... and I'm STILL full!! I was frustrated with my so-called-friends of my so-called-LIFE! and I decided to seek a nice evening instead a drama-filled night of pulling  Chinese Fire Drills on the southside of town. So I hollared at the sis and consulted Yelp to see where a great BBQ place is... Dave's was at the top of the list.  After hours and hours of texting - we were set! We got there on a Friday evening at around 7pm or so and there were several parties ahead of us, naturally. We were told it was a 25 minute wait. So we went outside to play with my new camera. Not even 15 minutes later - we were called to out table. YAY!  We sat down and I immediately started the BBQ Sauce taste test! Pouring them onto what was apparently where our used bones go. (ew) We tasted each kind and chose our favorites. Their Sweet & Zesty and Rich & Sassy (is that right?) sauces were my faves. I couldn't hang with the Geogria Mustard sauce nor could I take the devil's spit. I looove hot food, but I wasn't feeling the sauce. The Texas Pit was CRAZY-AWESOME! but it just didn't mesh well with the flavor of the bbq.   I was lobbying for The Feast the entire way there!! and YESSS... the sis and cousin agreed!! I had to ask the intertribal table battle cry... Are you HUNGRY... or are you STARVING?!?! the answer is ALWAYS starving!! haha!!   While an ENTIRE chicken, a WHOLE slab of pork ribs and half a briskit  were being prepared along with our corn on the cob, cole slaw, beans, french fries & corn bread muffins... we dined on fried catfish. Seriously - I didn't dig it. I think it was the flavor of the fish itself but the sauce it came with tasted pretty rad especially when mixed with the Texas Pit sauce! :)  And then... The Feast arrived! Served on a trash can lid... that I'm PRAYING has atleast been hosed off before hitting our table! :P It was HUGE, it was beautiful! :D I'm sooo glad we ordered it! We each grabbed our tong (it came with three) and we just dug in! I had two plates of food and I was STUFFED! I was in hog heaven!! I had several ribs and the BEST briskit i ever HAD!! The meat was perfect - the biggest letdowns was in the side dishes.  The corn was obviously frozen at one time - but still good. The beans were oniony (i don't like onions) so I didn't dig 'em. the fries were VERY salty... but still good. I wish we could have had more cornbread muffins. But I MUST say - the cole slaw was probably the best I have EVER had! Crazy yummy!  At the end of the meal - we couldn't hang. There was a huge amount of chicken left and and a few ribs and a TON of fries and we didn't even touch the beans. We took home two to-go boxes and still left some food on the our trusty trash can lid. We got to the car, to-go boxes in hand and I just wanted to lower the seat and just SLEEP! It was so good!!  I will DEFINATLY be back! It was crazy yummy. There were serious smoke rings in their ribs! their sauces were tasty and had zing to spare! Their prices were a lil high. (nearly $60 for The Feast!) but it was worth EVERY penny!! I am such a fan, I cannot imagine ever venturing into Chandler Mall's food court again with Famous Dave's being just a few steps away!

The other day I was reading my past reviews when i relized that I never reviewed Fez! I couldn't believe it!! So I decided to wait for a VERY special occasion to give my review... and what better occasion is there than my 100th review?!   And then came the next problem... which Fez experience do I share? Do I talk about the first time I went to Fez? Last summer when I went to my first Yelp Elite event where I first met their Sweet Potato Fries? That are so fresh and crispy and sweet and salty at the same time with their honey mustard type sauce? I remember those trays were vanishing before my eyes! I also can't forget the Fez kirsa with it's barbequed sauced grilled chicken, pears and cilantro melted on a large flatbread with manchego cheese.   Or do I talk about the time I caught brunch at Fez? I had the ever amazing Fez burger! I feel in love with their savory angus burger layered with pear and cheese on a chibatta bun, best lunch ever - even if the salad that it comes is a little on the bitter side. My cousin had the breakfast pasta. A bowl of sausage, peppers, onions, bacon melded together with scrambled eggs and finished off with parmesan cheese. My sister really enjoyed her Douxelle Burger with it's chibatta bun, angus beef, mushrooms, onions, provolone cheese, mustard and tomatos.   What about the yelp happy hour at Fez? Where my good buddy Robert M. introduced me to their pomegrantini... make it double pleez! Loves it.... I also tried their habanero poppers... sweet, spicy, creamy and crunchy at the same time! They're off menu ya'll but they are ALWAYS what I look forward to! just don't touch your eyes after popping one! Oh and their hummus!! Garlicky creamed chikpeas with olive oil and served with warm kisra. So delish!   And then there was the time I went to Fez for Queer Christmas. The queens were abound trading vinyl copies of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's Sings and a photo session with tranny santy with yours truely behind the lens! That was such an awesome night, but it wouldn't have been as amazing if it weren't for the crazy-awesome bartenders who were keeping them coming!  Or what about the time I went for my beloved Thomas' birthday party? We were tossing back Tommitinis all night long! I introduced all of ya'll to my good friend who helped me to break the ice with some strangers and helped me to attack a platter of their Rosemary Chicken Sandwiches... we drunkenly immersed ourselves in its goodness!! Rosemary/lemon marinated grilled chicken topped with pesto, artichokes and bell peppers. It was so good, I took some home!!  That event inspired me to give the Casablanca Chicken Sandwich a try when my mom and I happened to drop by for dinner one day. She really liked her fez lettuce wraps but found them difficult to eat... "It's so long! I can't fit it in my mouth!" she exclaimed... "Ummm... that's usually a good thing mom!" was my smart ass retort. lol... once she figured it out, happily declared them better than P.F. Chang's! haha!! Aren't moms cute?! I liked the Casablanca Sandwich, I found that the grilled chicken, goat cheese, pears, cherries and other various greens on a chibatta buns go VERY well with Fez's S&P fries. A combo, I think shouldn't ever be separated!   Yup... I'm not sure which experience I'll write about in my yelp review! All I know is that everytime I leave Fez I'm stuffed and eliated that I went, and that ain't the booze talking! One of the best things about Fez is that even though it's uber-slick and crazy-mod in decor... it still feels like home! I go and I know I'll see a friend... or atleast someone I drunkenly hit on inbetween drink orders! My ONLY complaint is that sometimes the servers need to be reminded of what you just asked for. I once ran out of the sauce for the sweet potato fries and needed to ask for some three times before I got it.   Another thing I'll need to think of when I do write my Fez review... is what is my message going to be to my yelpers? I think I'll say something like... Hurry up and GO! What has been keeping you?! Sure it's uber-sleekness may seem cold at first, but once you sit down and get comfortable, it becomes home. Give the sweet potato fries a go and try the Fez burger - you won't regret eaither! The people there are very cool and of course there's THOMAS!! The host with the most! Always with something crazy to say. He keeps the party rockin'! If there's ONE thing you need to know about Fez it's that you are about to have a good meal.   Yup... I think I'll write something along those lines! I unno... whatcha'll think?

Once upon a time... when Cher was still Cheryl... I sat in my auntie's old El Camino happily eating my strawberry shortcake when my auntie stopped at a red light on the corner of 20th street & Van Buren when out of no WHERE a crack head with a gun tried to car jack us. My auntie yelled and threw an half empty bottle of tequila out the window as she sped threw the intersection. This was more than 10 years ago and things haven't improved much since that day in this neighborhood.  When I read about Baiz Market it was from my fellow yelper Jim W. who ranted and raved and even encouraged me to check it out. The other night not having much to do, my friend Ree & I decided to go to Baiz Market which is just north of the intersection where my auntie & I almost got car jacked and check it out. We both have love for middle eastern food and know how to take on scary neighborhoods.   When we walked up to the counter of the deli inside the quaint grocery store we were excited and a little scared of what to order. The cashier was SO patient and VERY nice about explaining everything to us! I really must give her props on that. There was a cab driver who was very helpful in explaining the different dishes and even recommended a few items. I listened to Tarek S. and chose the beef Shawerma it was delishous! My friend chose the chicken toolawoosh (is that spelled right?) sandwich which was very good with it's bell pepper, pickles and tomato fixins. We also chose to sample the small spinach pies which weren't that good btw and cheese pie which I could make at home with pizza crust & some cheese and the yummy yummy hummus that came with some pita bread. We also got a bottle of water and a can of imported orange soda. ALL this for only $27! Can you believe that?!   The dining area was nice and quiet with mellow middle eastern music on in the background. Everyone kept to themselves and was nice to us even though we backed up the line.   After our meal we wandered around the candy aisle in the grocery store and found lil heart shaped boxes of chocolates which - ummm wasn't that great! lol. We wanted to spend a heck of a lot more time going threw every aisle but unfortunatly they were closing so we had to leave.   We will DEFINATLY be back! And prolly with a few more in tow. And no, no one tried to car jack us on our way out... but we did see a tranny hooker get questioned by the cops. Maybe if she went to Baiz Market for some baklava instead of walking the streets she wouldn't be in that situation! I'm just saying. To my yelpers, I say go! and when you go, order the beef shawerma and avoid the spinach pies! Oh and get there before 4pm so you can have time to really enjoy your meal without the rush!

Around the corner and down the road from my new place is the bestest sushi place!! Very mom and pop... if mom and pop were into lime green and sleek contemporary decor. Very clean and kinda ackwardly set up, Cafe Wasabi reminds me of Subway... except this is really fresh!   I've had the Hawaiian Roll and the Rainbow Roll - both were really good as was the Orange shrimp roll. The nigiri is good - but then again, nigiri is always good. :) Along the counter's sneeze guard are pictures and descriptions of the various rolls available. Some look too exotic to try and others are regular standbys. I can see first timers getting squeemish when they see them on display. One cool touch is the maaaany empty sake bottles that are decorated by the lucky souls that drank them. I have yet to try one myself - but the bottles on the shelves and counter sure look cute.  The sushi is good, I never had any stomach problems after eating there and I always leave there happy I came and promising myself that next time I'll try the green tea ice cream... i would - but I'm always too full!!

I'm sure this place is a great hike. However, I've only been to this mountain for the Lori Piestewa Memorial Services. And that is what this review is about.  I remember what it was like when Lori Piestewa was declared a prisoner or war and how my family got calls from Hopi inlaws asking us to pray in our way for her safe return. There were many things online, in our newspapers and on tv - we were so afraid. And then the inevitable came, the news we didn't want to hear.  I don't know if any of ya'll know this, but Tuba City and the Hopi Nation are small places. Both are tight knit communities where everyone knows one another. And the devistation felt by her loss was incredible. I remember a cousin of mine recalled it as "you could hear the cries in the streets". Every Native in the country probably went to bed hungry that night in honor of her.  And as for the name Squaw. I always knew it was bad. It was something you never said,  you never needed to say it. It was always something terrible. Once when I asked my grandfather what it meant he said "a terrible, terrible woman who's unfit to get married." I later learned that it meant, to his tribe, a women who was raped as a child and was deemed no longer fit to bear children. That was the interrpretation I grew up with and that is how I equate it today. I know of the mainstream meaning of that word, as a derogitory term for a vagina. But know that different tribes view it differently. but all meanings are terrible.  I've only been called a squaw once. and unfortunatly, that person knew what it meant and used it in that context. And inspite of my education, eloquence and empathy - I was nothing but a mere squaw to this person and to this state and so was it's mountian. And I gotta admit, it stung a little to hear Squaw Peak Freeway or Squaw Peak used so... lightly.   It was a wonderful day to hear Governor Napalitano decide to change the name to honor Lori Piestewa. I found it ironic and fitting. An elder once said, "Jessica may have gotten a movie, but Lori got a mountain!" And though she lost her life fighting for the freedoms of all Americans, she won a major battle in the war against using hurtful names from Indian Country's past to casually name things such as: mountains, sports teams, etc.  This little indian girl who cried when she heard that Woman Warrior died is now a young woman who does what she can to push for change in America - and a big part of what inspires me and other women of color (not just natives) was the renaming of this mountain. This Peak is more than just a place for a great hike, it's the beginning of a movement. I have never forgotten that everytime I've traveled to it's base to honor the woman who inspired the change. And I know this woman, where ever she is, smiles down knowing her daughter doesn't have to live in the same world where she once did - where Native women were constantly being cursed at when asked for directions. Where signs all over a city sliced through you like knives. Where you'd try not to whince whenever a non-native on TV spoke about the traffic. It's a wonderful world, I only wish Lori could see it.

Okay WHY hasn't anyone told me about this place before?!  I think I just found my new favorite Mexican place in the city!! and that says a LOT - I loves mah Mexican food!!  Earlier today my mom and I were on our way to visit a relative when we decided to go have dinner somewhere, I wanted Biaz Market, but she didn't want to try somewhere new. So I suggested Ranch Market and she agreed, as we parked I saw the sign that said resturant, and I thought this location didn't have a deli like the one on the South side does - and we were confused. We chose to just give it a try. And we stepped one foot beyond the large corridors and it was so COLORFUL!  This is what I mean by the 'hood being colorful, but here - you could actually SEE all the colors and it was beautiful. We wandered around and saw the cool stuff they have outside in a lil shopping area. But it was empty! We were worried that they were closed but trugged on ahead. waay in the back was the entrance of the actual resturant.   We were warmly greeted and seated right away because, at 4:30PM on a Tuesday - they were very empty... there were only 3 tables occupied in their very nicely decorated dining room which was very clean and even boasted a mural. Loves it! :)   our waiter brought us some chips and salsa but the salsa lacked a kick, it's never hot enought me (that sounded dirty didn't it?!) haha! So I asked for something spicer - he gave me a look of concern and said they had habenero sauce... BRING IT! I was excited... the H-Sauce was KILLER!! But oh - so - freakin - good!! I loved it! i started mixing sauces and dubbed myself the Salsa Alchemist! :D   After an entire bowl of chips, our food was ready. I had the Sampler Appetizer and it was very good. My mom had the combination with a Red Tamale, cheese enchilada with rice and beans. My sampler appetizer was sooooo good! The Flautas were nice and crispy and the seasoned chicken was awesome and went better with the mild sauce. The mini beef chimi was the BEST damned chimi I ever ever had! I wanted to pack the rest of my meal to go and order a chimichanga and eat that! lol! I had to have my mom sample it and she loved it too! The Sopricitos were AMAZING! I never had anything like that before. The waiter explained that they were a very thick Corn tortilla topped with seasoned chicken, lettuce, tomato, queso fresco & tomitillo sauce. I will definatly go back just for this dish alone! And as if that wasn't enough - the chicken enchiladas were very good, but the sauce was very deep... it had a very dark flavor. Almost too dark, I would have liked for it to have been a lil lighter in flavor. But it was still good.  My mom enjoyed her tamale but felt it was a tad too dry, she wanted red sauce but chose not too ask for it because she felt the enchilada sauce was way too strong for the tamale. She didn't really like her chese enchilada and didn't finish it. But she liked the beans and rice. and really enjoyed the automosphere as well as the chips and salsa.   Inspite those small faux pas, I'm still giving it the full 5 stars because the service was SO amazing. It's been a while since I've had exceptionally great service. Everything was spot on...   To my fellow yelpers: you MUST go and enjoy yourself! However, they have crazy-funky hours so look out for the signs that indicate whether or not they're open. I hope more people give this place a go - with the economy the way it is, I'd hate for this place to close because no one's going! And don't be afraid to ask for the Habenero sauce, yes it's melt your tounge atomically hot, but ask for an empty salsa bowl and start mixing the sauces and get your salsa alchimist on!!

One day, as my friend Darius and I were trying to kill some time before going to class we came here for lunch. This was Darius' first time with Mediterranian cuisine and after reading all the glowing reviews for here - I knew this was the place to take him! :)  We had some hummus as an appetizer, and oh em gee!! it was so great! I couldn't believe it was so creamy and perfectly garlicly!! Normally hummus is a lil too strong for me but this was great.  I had the Gyro plate and it was a LOT of food! I enjoyed it very much, I just wish it came with more pita bread. Gyro meat was plated with some more hummus, basmati rice and fixins for awesome gyros. My friend had this dish with garbanzo beans and lamb. He really enjoyed it and said it the meat was tender. I didn't try it but it sure looked good. :)  We closed our meal with some blaklavah - they have different varieties of the mediterranian staple, I had the walnut backlavah and he had the pistashio. I liked it but I've had better and it was WAY too sweet, I couldn't finish it!   Over all, this is one of the best places I've discovered since moving to Tempe. I really enjoy it and look forward to finding more places! To my yelpers, I say: GO! The food is yummy, the decor is cute and clean, the service is more than decent and the location is mill but NOT mill.. gotta love it!

I"m so happy that it's warming up! Cuz that means that I can go swim yet again at the Clarendon's awesome swimming pool! I love that they let non-guests come, swim, change and lounge in their uber cool swimming pool. they'll even give you water and towels! How cool is that?!  At night, Clarendon comes to life... sorta. If you supply the friends and plenty of drinkin' money, this place can be oodles of fun! I've had awesome conversations at the rooftop bar and have the chance to party at the craziest costume party I ever been to! But dude! $7 a shot?! WTF?! that's waaaay too much to spend for a friggin' drink unless you promise me that my funds are going towards cooling down that oven they call an elevator!   But no more complaints. They have the BEST bathroom I've been in a while (except for Pan Asian Fusion Sushi, their can kicks ass!) and everything is so chic and funky lookin' I could just spit! I especially love the lounge furniture. The quirky things make this place an excellent place to hang out. I hope ya'll go to their next event!

one bright and cheery day I took the world's longest walk from ASU's campus to Essence Bakery I almost gave up and was totally cursing myself for forgetting my bus card... but before I threw in the towl, turned around and ate at the Boston's i finally made it to my destination!   The small and easy to overlook Essence Bakery & Cafe is the fresh wholefood mecca of Tempe. Their food is organic, fresh, made purely from scratch and the love taken to make each dish shows!   From the start, there is a bakery case that hosts scrumptious macaroons, the green and yellow are my favorite but the pink rose flavored macaroons taste like purfume. Not pleasant at all!   I ordered the ham, cheese and jalapeno. on a crisp toasted bread came a creamy, salty classic sandwich that comes with a nice spicy kick. The perfect update to this sometimes ho-hum sammy. I totally dug the new spin but I would add some hot sauce on the bread! I also had iced tea and was surprised by all  the sweeteners, every tea sweetener imaginable was on this small table with ice and water. They had stevia, the blue stuff, the pink stuff, the yellow stuff, the refined stuff, the granulated stuff, the stuff in the raw and my favorite: agave nectar!  I sat down on the only available table and I realized that there was NO room in this small little place! The tables were all shoved against the walls, the chairs were uncomfortable and NOT fat girl friendly! Not cool! I squished and squirmed to fit in a chair and I didn't really enjoy eaiting inside. I think next time i'll avoid the pink macaroons that taste like perfume and I will also try the patio seat!!

I have traveled across the internet to sing the praises of a certain Thai restaurant. Through a semester and a half of research with one of my favorite ASU professors, we had dined at Yupha's Thai Kitchen once. It was incredible! One of the best Thai meals I've ever had was overshadowed by some service faux pas and thus they lost a star in my book... but the food (!) oh the food...   We began our meal with a sampler platter, it was a big plate of deep fried beige. Normally, this would repulse me and wish for some creativity, but I gave it a go before I started my ranting and it was SO good! the thai rolls are your basic deep fried spring rolls, at least the ingredients were fresh. but the plum sauce was great and it went well with the fried dumplings and I always enjoy fried tofu!  I ordered #850 the Lard Na. Thick noodles in a gravy with veggies. I was happy with it. I ordered it to be cooked at medium heat with a chili tray. Our server was very happy to accommodate me. :) But the highlight of the meal was my friend's meal. He ordered #812 Thai Beef Jerky. It was a nice hunk of beef that was marinated and then deep fried and served with sticky rice and a nice dipping sauce. It was crispy, tender, flavorful with a combination of spices I never really had before. I loved every bite I stole from my friend. The sticky rice went perfectly with it. It was served on this leaf atop a plate and the leaf perfumed the rice. It was a perfect dish. I *need* you to give it a try also!!   We capped off our meal with the Fried Banana & I cream. An Americanized Thai classic done right. I could have used a lil LESS honey in all honesty but that's just me.   Now for the bad news...  Everyone at the table got their food except for me. It took another 20 minutes for me to get my Lard Na. *harsh sigh* really?? I know Thai places usually serve food as its ready and not necessarily when the table's orders are all completed. But 20 minutes! Come on! AAAAND... the worst food crime didn't even happen at my table: at a table near me, a dish of hot food, pineapple fried rice maybe and the guests were a little bewildered at its sight but still began to eat it. They used the serving utensils and dished some of it out, one of them put the utensil in their mouth and began using instead of a fork or chopsticks (something I do sometimes too) . They laughed about getting free food... at the same time, another table got their food and same thing... one person was left out. **harsher sigh** and THEN the server realized what she had done, she gave the dish to the wrong table. So in what I consider to be very gross more than anything. The server grabbed the rice dish and its utensil that was sitting next to the dish on the table  from the table it was delivered to and brought it to the table it was supposed to go to. half eaten, with an obvious dent in it. Before the guest could say something, the server re-fluffed the rice and left the table. **shudder**  To My Fellow Yelpers: That's gross. And yet I stand by my 4 star review. The food's THAT good! But when you go, be sure to keep an eye on the servers. Just to be safe and speak up when your server serves you a half eaten dish.

Okay okay... let me be real with ya'll. I DID read the SoMo review back in the day when it first came out. Now, I had my Bay Area hopes & dreams and yeah - was a little disappoitned. But for real. It's a nice place. I hate it when reviews hype a place up only to be disappoitned because it wasn't cracked up to what it was supposed to be even though what it was - was actually really nice.   With that said. This is by FAR the nicest chinese resturant in this area! For real... show me a place that is more authentic AND more clean AND has better service THAT is in the South Mountain area. If you can... I'll give u $20!   If you do decide to go, you MUST try the Won Ton Soup! I love everything, the single shrimp that's always perfectly cooked with the aromatic broth with the stuffed won tons. It's my version of heaven. I always go here for the soup.   Some other favorite dishes are the Hunan chicken which has the right amount of spice and the baby corn is to die for! If you're not too adventerous then the Sweet & Sour is also good as is the Beef & Broccoli. I TOTALLY dig the Mongolian Beef which was suggested to me by a very friendly server.   I am so inlove with the decor and the teal plates and matching salt & pepper shakers and soy sauce pourer and platters. But as a big girl, I must admit... the chairs could be a lil more sterdier. I'm always scared that this is going to be the time I finally brake a chair! The menus are hard to read because of the frosty page covers. I always press the hazy plastic page protectors firmly over the paper and that usually makes it easier to read.   But all in all, it's a very nice place. I have taken quite a few of my friends there and have become somewhat of a regular. I have yet to finish a cup of water and soda because the servers are so attentative that they bring a fresh cup before my first one was even gone! The servers have always been willing to take special orders for me and are always willing to chime in on what they think the best dish is (when asked). I really love this place! :)

What the shell?! I never reviewed this place?! I have been going to Garcia's ever since I was a kid. My grandmother loved this place back when it was just a small hole in the wall south of mcdowell off of 35th ave... since my grandmother's day - it moved north to new digs a lil north of mcdowell.  Infact, my dad worked on constructing their current digs. So yeah, me and Garcia's go waaay back! haha!! Everytime I enter into their adobe lookin' house into their old world styled living room type waiting area. it's nice and antique but it could use a revamping. It's looked like this since I could remember! I am greeted by a 'round the way girl some Carl Hayden graduate who says hello and leads you into one of their many dining areas.   The large dining area has a raised celings and open spaces and have large murals depicting different places in Mexico and these wooden tables and huge leather chairs. Now I love the chairs... but they eaither need to be tighten their screws or get new ones because their chairs get more and more wobbly with each visit. I'm afraid I'm going to brake one one of these days!   The service is a two prong attack. There's a server/waiter who takes your order and brings you your first round of drinks and then will bring your food and your check... but then there's bus boys who will refill your drinks, salsa and chips and will bring you extra napkins and the smaller things you may need. I personally like this, because sometimes it can be tough getting our servers's attention because they can get pretty busy. Utilizing their bussers means that I never go long without being asked if I need something. YAY!! However, I usually tip a lil extra to cover the busser's share and sometimes if the busser is crazy cool (one of them snuck me a free bag of chips & salsa once!) then I sometimes tip them seperately.   I grew up dining on their tacos and I must admit - I don't really care for them. BOO!  But their rice and flautas are pretty good. but NOTHING tops their salsa & soup. Their salsa is so clean fresh and cool flavor. it's nice and mild but sooo flavorful! I love it! :)   The soup is the showboat of this resturant in my eyes. I feel if you go... you MUST try their caldo! I have yet to try their menudo as I always forget about it whenever I'm there during the weekend. I am in LOVE with their Caldo... it's pretty much veggie beef stew. It's wonderfully not as thick as other stews, huge pieces of potato with zuccinini, corn, green beans, carrots, onion, celery and cabbage. Only rez'd out grandma's make it better! Please give it a try!!  Other dishes I dug there was the Pollo Fundido, miniature sampler and fajitas. I had their carnitas and wasn't that impressed with them. But the Minature sampler is where it's at! I loves it and the white sour creamtype sauce that comes with it. :)   Over all, I'm glad I have this resturant in my family's history. It's actually quite good. It's not too far from my house and it's my mom's favorite place. I just can't dig their tacos and their beans always need salt. Meh. The service is decent but it can be a pain to get parking. The place needs to be redecorated and revamped a lil. It's one of my regular haunts and i always leave happy and full of chips, salsa and caldo!   To my yelpers: if you decide to go... PLEASE try the caldo, it's really the best thing ever! and enjoy your salsa and don't have high expectations of the beans but the rice will be awesome! Oh and don't be afraid to ask the busser for anything!! just be careful to tip a lil extra if you do utilize the bussers' services! :)

In a town where there's no substance, no culture, where the only lovingly cooked hunk of meat is the care the drones at Native New Yorker take in making sure they poured the right pre-packaged sauce onto your order of chicken wings. Yes, in this insepid culinary anti-mecca sits a beacon of light and TACO be this BELL's name!   Hardee-Har-Har!!  Okay, maybe I exaggerate. Perhaps the hot wing sauces at NNY are NOT prepackaged? lol... but I digress.   I do like this Taco Bell, it doesn't have the ghetto overtone that most TBs in the city have. It's cleaner than most also. My favorite meal is three tacos with a Baja Blast & carmel apple empanada. Baja Blast is the BEST part of going to taco bell! It's an awesome soda! I wish they bottled it! I'd totally buy it by the two liter! :)   Anyway - it's an awesome place. BUT they close early compared to other Taco Bells. so that kinda suckz. but oh well. it's all good. :)

I totally agree with Kristin C. on this one!!  The food is expensive compared to other Taquerias in the city and there's nothing that stands out about it! It isn't great or even very fresh. One thing that REALLY irritated me was that it takes FOREVER to get your order to go! Nearly half an hour. And good luck if you choose to dine in!   It's a small family owned business, but they really need to change their prices. I'd go back, but I'd call ahead first! IF their prices were lower. I live so close! But Taco Bell is RIGHT there and they may not be as good, but dangit! They're cheaper and faster!

About a month ago or so, I gave El Gran Taquito another try and I was very surprised! I'm a little bit of a regular now! Having gone there three times in the past month!   I am happy to report that they got rid of these HUGE wooden chairs they used to have and exchanged them for some smaller more sturdier chairs yay! They also worked on their timing, I never waited longer than 15 minutes for a dine-in order for two. They have also added to their menu, now boasting 16 combos and now includes new breakfast & lunch specials. They have also lowered their prices, their combos range between $4.50 - $7.25, which is GREAT!   more professionalism with their staff. He was nice and helpful and even suggested substitutions, but he was obviously very young and kind of... figity. Their dining area could use some love, it's never dirty dirty, but I usually have to wipe off the table with a dry napkin before we sit down.   My favorite is the #16, a taco, enchilada and toastada with rice and beans for only $7.25! It's a lot of food too! *see pics* The enchiladas are my favorite! They don't put onions in them!! YAY!! Their tacos are nice and crisp and the lettuce is always fresh (big huge plus for me). They could use some more chili in their hot sauce, it lacks that nice kick I like in my hot sauce. The beans and rice are decend, nothing special - but still decent.   I hope you go to El Gran Taquito soon and give them a try, it's not wonderful or perfect, but it is good and I'm a fan.

This is one of my favorite chinese places!   I love to take my mom here. We have very different ideas of what good Chinese food is and this place leaves us both satisfied. It's very affordable - I think it's around $10 per person for dinner and that includes all you can eat Sushi!! ^0^   I love the soups and sauteed entrees, they're very good. In the back corner, there's the specialty items!! Some of them are dishes are a little too exotic for me but they smell amazing!! someday I'll get the gumption to try them!   I would totally recommend this place to anyone who likes chinese food! It's a little hidden in a strip mall location. They have awesome sushi and I especially love nigiri! :) and all your time tested chinese-american favorites as well as some thing you've never seen before! oh! and ICE CREAM!! whoo!! who doesn't want to end a meal with all you can eat dryer's ice cream??? Go and get a little crazy!! :)

This place loses a star for well... scrappiness.   I have been going to all the Big Apple restaurants forEVER!! I love this place. It's serious comfort food! I dig the beef ribs, they're all you can eat and they'll ask you if you want more. I can never handle more than two platefulls. However... if you get a cool server and are polite, they just might let u take ur leftovers home! :D   I like the  meals, seriously - I do. But they come with so many SIDES!! It's overwhelming! So what I usually do is ask for a double salad and skip the corn & baked beans. they're not that great anyway... the beans that is. But I know a lot of ppl who love the hell out of them, but they're not me.

"I wanna go to the flower place!!" was the reaction when i asked my cousin and friend where we should have lunch inbetween classes one Arizona afternoon. I couldn't think of what she meant when she said, flower... I instantly thought of Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe but I was quickly corrected when she said that she was referring to the rose in the Garcia's logo.  Now, I have never been to one of the Garcia's Chain resturants, but the Original Garcia's off of 35th ave has been an institution in my family for decades. I was willing to try the AZ mills chain location since it was near by... and I would later regret it.  We entered a very beautiful place, everything was very open and can be seen from the mall's walk ways. It was slightly unnerving to try to enjoy some messy taco while some lil 5 year old in a stoller stares at you. Ummm... no... Timmy... this is MY taco!! Back off!   It was 2 in the afternoon and we were the ONLY customers there... and the mall was PACKED! That should have told me something, but we still sat at a tiled table anyway. The hostess/waitress brought us the SALTIEST bowl of chips ever! it came with salsa and a bean dip that was way too heavy on the onions in both cases. I could barely eat the salsa, but I couldn't hang with the beans at all.   We ordered our food and it came out very quickly. My friend ordered green corn tamales and she liked them but I they were on the rubbery side and my cousing got the taco and tostada combo and thought it was okay, she didn't complain. And I got the minature sampler and was unimpressed. it was just food... nothing great or special or exceptionally awful... just average.   What wasn't average was the bill.... nearly $50 for our meals?! Are you kidding?! And we didn't even have a hard drink on the table! I paid but wasn't happy about it... I thought it was going to be a lil less than that!  To my yelpers: I know the Arizona Mills area is a cesspool of resturants, where chains reign surpreme... and unfortunatly, this place is amongst one of the worst. I say, save your money and skip out on this place because it's nothing significant and the saltyness of their food will only make your bloated as you're shopping afterward and that can't be cute!

This was my first encounter with Tapas and I have got to say, it was amazing!! My sister and I got the oppurtunity to attend the Yelp Elite Event held here, and we really enjoyed ourselves.  It's a FAAAR drive from my house (almost an hour!) but it was nice to have a change in scenary and pace. So we took my car out there and when we got there, we rode the elevator and were very impressed with their amazing decor. Swanky, fresh, and lusty... it was casual, chic and comfortable at the same time!  We were met with a very helpful staff who enjoyed seeing our reactions to all the great food! Maybe it was the entire pitcher of sangria I had to myself... but those were the BEST damned baby back ribs I have ever had! Sweet, spicy and falling off the bone! They were so succlent, I wanted to cry. I had a chance to talk with their head chef and complimented them on all the great food, the asparagus was devine as was the chorizo and potato dish! My favorite for the night! I guessed how it was made and wasn't told a THING! DAMNIT! (grrr!) I fell in love with the Spanish tortilla which is more like a frittata or really thick omlette.   Every dish was spot on and made me want to cry... or was that the entire pitcher of sangria again? I unno, but it was incredible and the back patio was amazing! Perfect for parties and out door dining. I would recommend this for anyone willing to travel to it's far north location.  To my yelpers: if this is far for you, like it's far for me... I still say GO! Give sitting indoors a try and tell me how it goes. Order the baby back ribs and chorizo potatos and be ready to beg the chef for the secret recipe like I did! Try the sangria, but don't drink the entire pitcher like I did... I wound up talking about Dominatrix Dungens in an Applebee's parking lot that night!! Not a pretty sight! :(

I've only eaten here once. And when I went, it was a nice time. I had a nice strawberry & chicken salad. It was verrrry sweet! It almost hurt my teeth! The place is very beautiful and small. I don't recommend coming with a large group unless you want to dine outside.   The outdoor dining area is very beautiful. The Hear Museum is a very pretty place. I love the water canal and mock wo'o (swimming holes).   My largest complaint is that besides the Pesole (which isn't that great btw), nothing on the menu is traditional Native American Fare. As a Native person who appreciates the wonderful tastes and textues of traditional Native foods from the many tribes of Arizona... to have a museum that celebrates our cultures and yet doesn't celebrate our food is counter productive and disappointing. We eat more than frybread!!  If you're out at the museum and want a nice quiet lunch in a tranquil autmosphere this is a great place to dine. But PLEASE don't think what they serve is what Natives eat!

Best Chinese food in the city... and thee WORST service in the state!  That's the best way to sum up this place. There isn't much that isn't said already in the vast amount of reviews for this place... Now I HATE bad service. I've been known to walk out or ask to see a manager if I get shitty service, but this place has such amazing food, it kind of works itself out.   The first time I came here, it took over half an hour for the waitress to ask us what we wanted to drink (!) and then it took another 45 minutes for them to bring the food to us after we ordered. And what I hate is that the servers all have this American Diner from the 60s attitude like "yeah, yeah, yeah... I'm coming, I'm coming. Whaddaya have?" Geez, some fucking service with a smile please? In dining here a few times, this doesn't let up... even when the room is HALF FULL it will STILL take forever to be waited on and it will STILL take forever to get your food, I suggest bringing in some tacos from JITB as an appetizer. Also, protip: if you act like you're in a rush or suuuuper annoyed you'll get faster service; something I picked up on when some regulars at the next table over told me and my friend they do it all the time.   Do NOT go here if you're in a rush, it's going to take at least an hour to dine here aaaaand about 15 minutes to eat all the delicious food!! My favorite meal is the Egg Drop Soup to start w/ Orange chicken & Hawaiian beef for the meal with egg friend rice HOLD the onions. perfect meal, less than $30 with enough left overs for a healthy midnight snack... okay 10:30PM snack!

This place is like an onion. The outside looks a little rough and it isn't until you see the inside can u know how pungant the onion actually is!  As it's dirty brown exterior doesn't really scream "eat here!" but the huge mural on one wall does help so does the clear christmas lights hanging from it's roof.   One Saturday night a friend and I went venturing for a nice place to dine and came upon this place. I have always wanted to try this place as there are no other Italian places on the South side besides small Pizza places.   So we went and checked out the menu first and everything sounded good especially the risoto. But everything was moderately priced. Nearly $20 a plate. I wasn't expecting that! Most places on this side of town are on the cheaper side which makes the south side so wonderful (if u know where to go) a place to dine.   We made some deals with ourselves and thought about what to order and what not to order and then entered...  And what met us was a smell I wouldn't wish upon ANYONE!  It was an odd mix of cat urine, burnt garlic, rancid citrus... and maybe burnt bacon? but the most noticiable was the cat urine. I put on a brave face and got met with a bit of an attitude from their tight black t-shirt wearing Simon Cowell wanna be host/server that if we didn't make reservations, we weren't going to get a table for atleast an hour.   I looked about the tiny dining room and saw people in small groups dining and having an okay time in the dimly lit dining room. I thought about waiting but the smell was so strong! My friend said it was a sign and refused to wait for a table.  We wound up going to Sun Asian Kitchen and had a nice time. I still can't get over that smell! I never encountered anything like it!

Dear Plesant Nails,  I have been to the nail chop chop that is Nail Too and I just want to say... I'm sorry for all sh*t I've talked about you. I didn't know bad nails until I went to this place. I blame the chick at the bus stop whose fierce nails made me jealous. I went in search of the 'Island" pedicure and gel back fills. That's it... pure and simple. and they STILL jacked it up!  The first guy was recommended to me and I insisted that I get gels, he got tired of me and dropped the drill and went back to a pedicure. Then an older lady wearing a jeweled encrusted tank top (i'm SO not lying!) and platform heels took a shot at it... and she kept nicking my nail bed. It was soooo painful! I couldn't believe it! That was SO my cue to leave... but before I was out the door, another lady with the most ornate nails EVER came and grabbed the drill and finished the job.  she was good, but I KNOW that was acrylic!! Plesant Nails had gel... actual gel on my talons... this place, had acrylic with an odd coating that was supposedly gel. I wasn't convinced. I liked the design. but I'm still frustrated. I chose not to get a pedicure as I just wanted to get out of there... the price was okay but my nails were in PAIN for days as the older lady really dug into my nail bed.   I ended up popping them off and waiting several weeks before trying it again. At a different location.   So, although I won't give you another chance Plesant Nails, I just want to say that I'm sorry for allt he grief I caused you... I've been on the other side of the fence and apparently i was on the greener side all along!   My Best, Cher T.

it's been over a week since I've been here and I still can't get over how good the food was! i love this place. I came here with my good friend Ree, after scouring yelp for a good place near by, we settled here for for dinner. I had a great time. :)   I was STARVING when we entered the small resturant in a strip mall in Tempe. We immediatly ordered some tea and the Chicken Satee. I had the lemongrass tea, which was AMAZING btw... and my friend ordered the Thai (chai) tea and didn't care for it. I thought it kinda sucked that they didn't have free refils, but I guess that's a smart move considering the fact that they serve crazy spicy food! and can ... make more money! :P  Looking over the menus, I loved how you can choose your dish and then choose which type of protien for it to be cooked with, you can choose chicken, pork, beef, seafood or tofu. My We placed our order and had a good time. We waited quite a while... a little too long, considering the place was half-full.   Finally our food came and it was quite the event. My friend ordered the sizzling beef and it came out still sizzling on a hot iron plate, think Thai Fajitas. They were good but after a while my friend couldn't finish it because it was so sweet! I had a bite and I thought it was good, but I could tell it was a little on the sweet side. My dish wasn't as extravegent, but still good! I had the spicy noodles with Chicken. It was crazy yummy! Nice and spicy, i felt the burn occasionally in the back of my nose... amazing.   We ordered dessert from the not as gracious waitress, but I guess it's okay... she wasn't rude... just not very happy to be there. The dessert was good. I had the warm purple sticky rice with coconut ice cream topped with chopped peanuts and my friend had the fried bananas with coconut ice cream that was also topped with chopped peanuts. I loved mine, it was this perfect combination of warm and cold and sweet and creamy with a lil zing of salt from the peanuts which completely changed the profile of the ice cream. I was in heaven! :D my friend's dessert was also great. The fresh bananas were wrapped in what I think if rice paper and deep fried to a nice crispyness, it was sweet but not too sweet. a great ending to the meal.  To my yelpers - I say go. have fun and order dessert but please don't expect stellar service. I'll definatly be back for sure - with another thai cuisine lover in tow. :) Any takers?

Oh Chompie's... one of my favorite Tempe finds! Chompie's is home to my favorite soup! Chicken Matzoball Soup! Delicious and onxious with awesome flavors. I have had a great time sittig outside yapping with my sister about who knows what while munching on the biggest pastrami and saurkraut sandwich EVER! This thing was HUGE! I was scared, I was elated, I was determined.   I went again for dinner and had my same matzoball soup but this time I had the Chicken Schnitzel. Warm. crunchy and full of flavor I was elated. The sides were eh, I make better carrots and the potatos were okay but the gravy had an odd flavor I wasn't too fond of. I have YET to try a dessert, but someday I am going to damnit!!   Oh and the pickles are yummy! :D Jussayin' The service leave MUCH to be desired for. We had to ask for everything about twice and the staff likes to play handsie in a closed section behind frosted glass. I had craptastic service both times I went. But I still hope ya'll give chomp down on some Chompie's and fall in love with it like I did!!

I'm not reviewing the type of establishment this place is during the day... I'm talking about what happens at NIGHT!!  The Rocky Horror Picture Show shows every Saturday night at Midnight at the Chandler Cinemas!!   Come As You Are Productions and AZRocky has been rocking the stage for the past couple of years. I was taken to AZRocky by a good friend last year and I have taken nearly EVERY close friend of mine there ever since!  We go to this place on late Saturday nights to go see the freaks, the geeks and everyone inbetween. There can be a barrage of folks in fetish gear, lingere or other types of costume. Parading around or smoking outside the theatre before the pre-show starts. I must admit... some of the costumes are CRAZY! And some make me wanna try walking in 6 inch stilletto leather boots that go up to my thighs. Feel free to Come As You Are!  Although u MUST bring something to cover up with so all the goodies aren't hanging out.   The pre-show is the best part of the night! Matteo, the owner hosts the late night festivities of very mature content in very immature ways! There are costume contests with prized from Zia Records! (WEEEEeee!!) or Hot Topic any zany place where the alternitivos of Phx venture. And of COURSE the Sacrifice of the virgins!!! (SCREAMS OUTLOUD!!) This includes the rocky oath and some sort of humilitating task for the 18-year-old and older virgins.   This is a great event for those who are 16 and older. As there are some things that go on there that are for the immaturely mature only! This is a great date movie... because seriously?? who WOULDN'T be turned on by scantily clad transvestites, bisexual adultary and incestual aliens???   Now if you do decide to stay up late and decide to venture into the oh so welcoming leather and lace gloved arms of the AZRocky cast I recommend the following DOs and DONTs....  - DO Show up on the early side and dance to whatever crazy songs the spazzed out DJ likes to play!! Sometimes it's techno, sometimes it's 90s pop, sometimes it's 80s pop, sometimes it's hardcare thug music... sometimes it's death grind metal... u just NEVER know!!!  Say 11PM, BUT dont' be surprised if things start a lil late, don't worry, just kick back on the love seats (I can't promise there hasn't been any lovin' on them! ;)) and wait, they'll yell for u when they're ready for u to enter the theatre! :)   - DO donate some money to the AZRocky company!!! What they do is so crazycoolandawesome!! So YESS!! Support!!   - DO dress up!! It doesn't have to be Rocky gear, although you'll totally be loved if you do!! Whatever goth, tranny, or kandi kid outfits that makes you smile will totally make everyone else smile!! Also lingerie is cool just be sure to cover up the "good stuff!"  - DONT bring the drama!! Drama is such a drag! I remember once there was a couple that was fighting mid-rocky!! I just turned around and told them BOTH where they could go!!  -DONT mind all the yelling! lol! It's real, that's one of the best parts of Rocky!! The yelling!! The trash talking, the lame jokes, the innapropriate jokes, are what makes Rocky, Rocky!! So enjoy it! Laugh and yell along!! I can't TELL you how satisifying it is to yell Elbow Sex over and over again when everyone else is doing it!   -DO dance!! I mean come on!!! What is the point if you're not going to do the time warp?? *Scoffs!* Just get off ur duff and do it!! You'll never regret it! :)  - DO compliment the outfits of those who are dressed up. I know it's kind of odd being around a bunch of ppl who are dressed to kill (some literally)  and it's crazy easy to just be a wall flower, but starting off with a compliment can make all the difference! :)  -DO go to denny's afterward!! The entire cast and faithful Rocky fans go to the Denny's off of Country Club Road & Southern (I think) after each and every performance. It's so awesome to just talk to them and crack dirty jokes and who doesn't love sharing pancakes with a bunch of sequined transexuals at 2 in the morning? Pass the butter! ;)  So YES! Go!! Pay ur $6 and chill till they yell at u to come! Enter at ur own risk! and be prepared to yell, scream, to fondle the person next to you, to be picking rice out of your hair the next day, to sing ur best falsetto rendition of Bohemian Rapsody, to wonder where u can rent Hedwig and the Angry Itch, To laugh until you cry, to can't stop thinking of ur favorite episode of Spin City as you watch berry boswick dance in drag, to wonder exactly how tall IS Tim Curry, to be scared that you're going to get sacrificed, to wonder where u can get a gold speedo at this time of night and is THAT Cher T. from Yelp.com over there??? And chances are, it IS!!   See ya'll there!

The best way I can describe the Steele Indian School Park is:  "This land once was used as a place where Native Culture came to die and is now being used as a place where Native Culture comes to be revived"  I have been to sooo many events at this park.   The Native American Recognition Day Parade ends here and you can usually see members of different dance groups still dressed in traditional attire laughing and dancing or just catching up. With a powwow to follow.   There are several gourd dances held there. Gourd dancing is a very important ceremony where veterans of the military are recognized and thanked for their contribution by their people and are honored justly. It's an amazing experience to go.   Recently, the Arizona Indian Festival was held at the park. There were traditional villages as well as various dance groups and arts and crafts vendors and of course... frybread! The festival was a way to take in the different cultures of the many 22 tribes in Arizona.   On "normal" days, it's a nice place to just be. The land itself has been blessed MANY times and I remember once, a medicine man had asked the Creator to have the park serve the people and asked the the land be able to take anything He has in store for it. Several years later, the two helicopters crashed and landed about 5 yards from where that man once stood.   Since, I know of many groups who came out to rebless the land and I, as a Native American, see it as the park doing just what was asked. It served the people. That accident could have taken more lives then the ones taken. But instead, it landed in the park and the land took it. And is even starting to heal. It served the people that day. As horrible a tragedy as it was, it could have been truely devistating.   Nearly all Natives have a story of the old Indian School in their family. And it's actions have caused many reprocussions. some natives were taught to hate their culture and traditional languages. And to this day, refuse to share their knowledge with their families. Some, had good times and like to sit around and laugh about their experiences climbing the fence to go run around in Phoenix. (my auntie has SEVERAL of those stories!!) In the 1800's and early 1900's, it was a tragic place to exist. But like I said earlier, our culture didn't die.   We still sing. We still dance. we still speak our languages. We still grow and learn and teach our young ones. We, as a people, still live on.

This place was so AWESOME! After getting the boot from Dave & Buster's i and my friends visted this place to go kick it and get something to eat.  I heard the praise of a few of my friends saying this place was crazy awesome, but I ignored it not really caring what everyone thought. I came in a it's 50s cool! I totally dug it! We sat down and saw the HUGE menu! I barely had enough time to wrap my head around the huge variety of flavors before our waitress came over asking what we wanted.   "Uhhhh... a few more minutes to read everything on your menu! Oh, waters all around."  We got a raised eyebrow from our redheaded waitress and then we ordered practially half the menu. I got the SERIOUS burger which was a 1/2 pound burger and it was a BIG burger! It was so yummy! :) I added their seasonings that come on the table. My toppings were Blue cheese, terriyaki sauce, pineapples & bacon. It was CRAZY awesome, but I'll admit - there were a few bites that made me turn green! But it's all good. After we ordered - we had to ask the waitress for shakes and floats.   BUT their soda did NOT taste good! We told the waitress and she didn't believe us! I think she went off and tasted it for herself before she agreed to remake our floats. We wound up with a dozen cups on the table before the meal was done. I had a cherry coke & vanilla bean ice cream float and my friend had a white chocolate raspberry shake.   At the end of the meal, one of my friends was stuffed and couldn't finish his burger - not sha-girl! I finished my burger AND most of the fries. But danggggg... I was FULL! i dont' think I could hang with their one pound burger! After you're done with the burger - they'll take ur picture with a big burger hat on and they post your picutre in their hall of fame. So everybody can see and aspire to your level of piggishness! LOL, and unfortunatly - I am nothing to aspire to since I could barely finish HALF the amount of food! LOL. Here there were two little kids at a different table who could! *hides in shame*  But eaither way - it's a great place to eat. There's a lot of fun to be had at cheeburger cheeburger. Don't be shy to ask for more time to read the menu because it's HUGE! Have fun and don't bite more than you can chew!

I loove this place. Even though it has it's flaws... it's still a good place!   Okay first off... it's CRAZY expensive!!   four ppl is EASILY over a $100! The service is TERRIBLE. But the food it yummy!! It's crazy how much I'll put up with as long as the food is good! If you go, I totally recommend the tempanyaki grill! But that menu is crazy expensive too!!   A plate of sushi is around $20. and the boat is the best thing on the menu! I love to go there and just feast on the boat! It comes with Tempura, terriyaki beef & chicken. It also comes with pot stickers and slices of pinapple. As well as sushi. Bring your appetite for this one! It's good food!   The service needs some serious work! We got our sushi 30 minutes after our boat was served and of course we were full to the max! We struggled to finish it but dang, we couldn't! so we just took it home.   When you go to Ichi Ban, bring your patience, your appetite and some extra cash!! Cuz you're gonna need all three to have a good time!

Word... that's best way I can say it... I've had better.   I really had crazy high hopes for Stacy's. Pulling up to the former corner store, I could smell the smoke in the air and felt my hopes rise even further away from me. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I knew I wanted it to be good.   Walkin' in, I saw the "They love on YELP" sticker and was so glad. Stacy's is good and unfortunatly... he knows it. We looked over the sign and wasn't sure what to get. My mom ordered the small beef sandwich with onion rings. I started to order, but then stopped my self and was given a smart ass remark from the cashier. My bad... dang. Ummm let me get the large pork sandwich with sweet fries and small cole slaw and grape kool-aid. Our order came to nearly $20 For a simple lunch!!  We waited and sat and heard some slimely businessmen talking about titties, cigars and cars... *shudder* overhearing their conversation made me regret being straight. gag. Our food was brought to our table and I was... underwhelmed.   The fries looked limp and lifeless, like they were rememnts from the past lunch hour. not at all cruncy or flavorfull... besides the sugary cinammon sprinkled atop them. The sandwich was okay... but just okay. It reminded me of manwhich with extra liquid smoke. the cole slaw was uninspired (Who knew cole slaw needed inspiration?) It needed heavy doses of pepper and a kick of salt to be decent. The Kool-Aid was too sweet to drink and I wound up chugging a third of it before adding some water to it and then was able to ward off diabetic coma for that day.   My mom liked her sandwich but didn't like that it was SOO small! She was really disappointed but liked the flavor and wanted more. She also liked her onion rings, I had a couple and they were good. I want to give it another go. Because so many people liked it, it has to be good... right?! It could have been a bad day or something, I'm really hoping it was. Because based off of my experience... best BBQ in the city?? Hardly!

One day, my je'e (mother) and I were wandering around Mesa trying to figure out where in the hell we were. The Navi was on the fritz and we were both getting aggrivated.   "I'm not trying to get us lost Cheryl Miranda... I'm trying to find somewhere to eat - I'm hungry!" She shouted at me while nearly sideswiping a car off of Stapley - it was our third near accident that day.   "Oh... DUDE! Turn Left at Main - there's a place that has popovers!" (For my non-O'odham yelpers, Popovers is my tribe's nickname for frybread; wah-much-tha is the traditional name for it btw)   "POPOVERS!! Hell no! If you want frybread, we'll go home and you can make some!"  "Awww... come on! It's prolly the only place around here anyway!"  So we turned into a rather... dank looking strip mall (aren't they all dank looking?) and my mom nearly slammed into a drive thru sign for a small taquillia who specializes in tortas. We pulled up to a small resturant that was BRIGHTLY painted with Apache Crowndancer and large promises of Apache burgers & Navajo Lamb.   When we entered we found a large airy room with a small dining room. Tables and booths to line the windows. There was a cute lil White couple dining on large tacos and huge sodas and a counter where employees took the order. We grabbed a couple of menus and then sat at a booth and looked things over.  "oh my gosh! haha! the ONLY difference between an Apache burger and a Navajo burger is that an Apache burger has two patties!" I giggled to my mom.  "Well... Navajos are really skinny." Score one for mom!  "the ONLY difference between an Apache taco and a Navajo taco is that one has crushed (think refried) beans and the other doesn't."   "oh what in the HELL?!" I exclaimed as I turned the menu and I saw the monstrosity they call a dessert. The "tempting" Indian Dessert... looks - (I'm so sorry to say this) disgusting! I'm sorry! Grandma never EVER put so much on a frybread! It comes with a full sized frybread topped with a HUGE scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate syrup, powdered sugar & cinnamon. It's too much! frybread has such an amazing texture and delicate flavor... it's best when hot and to dump so much STUFF on it and let it get melty and gloopy is - gross. My advice is to stick with the basics and get a LIGHT dusting of sugar OR honey.   We were both a little grossed out at the thought of the 'indian dessert' and decided to finally order. I had the red chili taco with whole beans (which cost extra). Normally - at frybread stands, it's called a red chili combo but not here. The madre got a whole bean taco (navajo taco).   We started to talk with the employees for a second and it turns out they are pretty friendly. We got our drinks and sat back down. I began to really get a scope of the room. Photographs of Apache Sunrise Ceremonies where plastered on the walls as well as cradleboards and small Navajo rugs. I thought it was cute and I'm glad all the art was authentic. Within a few minutes, an employee came out from the kitchen and brought us our food.  The bread was normal sized (umm... I guess large to non-natives?) it had a great texture and was very fresh. I liked the redchili's flavor but was disappointed it wasn't very hot. Their hot sauce was good and I put it on EVERYTHING! My mom liked her taco as well but wished there was more salt. She in turn - then sprinkled half the shaker on our table onto her taco.   We wound up ordering another couple of breads one with honey and the other with sugar and enjoyed our light dessert. Overall the food was good. I'm glad the service was quick and friendly and I'm even more grateful that the chili sauces were fresh and flavorful. The bread itself was crisp and light and yet still hearty. It takes a lot of years to develop such technique - I was quite impressed with it.  the prices on the other hand... compared to on-reservation stands are astronomical but when compared to powwows and the state fair they are still a little high but when compared to other resturants - they are actually cheap. lol... odd I know. The entree`s are about $7 at the resturant but NOTHING will EVER make me to pay over $3 for ONE single tortilla! That is outrage! it should be $3 for a half dozen, but not for one thick tortilla!   To my yelpers, These are real Natives. They are cooking traditional recipes handed down from generations. The bread is good. The dining area isn't anything to write home about. The prices are both decent and highway robbery at the same time.  The cooking facilities and the dining area appear very clean. The burgers and mutton appear to freshly grilled. If you're in the area - give it a try. But do NOT order that damned dessert! I don't wanna hear about one of ya'll slipping into a diabetic coma from eating it.

Three words: yummy, yummy, YUMMY!!   I loooved this place! My sis & I went here for dinner earlier today. I have been stalking my fellow yelper's reviews of this place for a couple of months now. And I have wanted to come here before a looong time ago and after hearing all the good things - I decided I NEEDED to check it out!  I called ahead and made a reservation... I wasn't sure if he got my name right or not. He kept calling me claire or Sherri. (I get that a lot!) We were only 10 minutes late for our reservation but when we entered - we were the only table besides a small family overwhelmingly groaning in extacy over their food. A great sign of things to come! I tried the tempanade type bruscetta filled with eggplant, olives and onions. I'm not an onion fan so i could only handle one lil bit of it. the plain bread was awesome and so was our meal!  I ordered a pizza (GOSH i wish I could remember the exact name!!) It had the most amazing pizza sauce ever! The tomatoes were soft and yet held their texture and it was sweet and yet had a slight kick to it - perfection. There were also sausage on it - which was incredible! and broccoli or a lighter version of broccoli. I was astounded that a pizza could taste this great. I wanted to just eat and eat but we had a movie to catch and I got into my conversation instead of eating like i always do!  My sister got a chicken dish smothered with marsala sauce, a single slice of prosciutto all topped with mozzerella cheese. It was divine! The chicken was wonderfully cooked and went well with the prosciutto as well as the cheese. The marsala sauce was more of a gravy, which surprised me. I'm used to marsala sauces being thinner and darker color and slightly sweet and this sauce was thicker and creamier and savory but it was still good. The Penne pasta it was served with was good, but not great. But I wasn't about to complain.  I really wish we could have gotten dessert, but we had a movie to catch! Our server was great - he filled the room with his voice! lol and it was very loud in the resturaunt. Which was great and not so great at the same time. I'm used to quiet sitdown restarunts and loud taquierias. but it was stil a good time. One other diner asked the owner/server what I had ordered. I think they even ordered what I got!  I will DEFINATLY be back!! And I am bringing SEVERAL people! :) Hopefully their few tables can hold us all!

don't get me wrong, I'm still a HUGE fan of this place!! Whenever I'm on that side of town, I whimper at the thought of not being able to go here. Damn economy! *sigh*   But recently, I had my chance... to yet again dwell in the goodness that is Pizza a Metro. and GOOD GOOGLY MOOGLY!!! That's a HUGE pie!! A good friend and I went there when he said that he wanted a LOT of food. "I want to order a small have a whole trough come to the table!" Not feeling the Heart Attack Grill, I convinced my friend to try PIzza a Metro. We did and it was wonderful! A little to loud for our liking - we really needed to shout to hear one another. But we loved it.   We shared the gnocchi with vodka sauce and I could just feel the world being lifted off my shoulders!! haha! He never had gnocchi before I feel I may have ruined him for it forever. Then we had the Pizza a Metro with three different types of toppings! THREE feet of pizza ya'll!! It was a shit load of food!! I couldn't believe it! Three feet of Sausage w/broccoli, arugula & procutto, and various meat toppings! It took up most of the table! We dug in and by the end of the night, most of that bad boy was gone! I couldn't believe we ate that much!   Oh and if that wasn't enough - our waiter told us of the various desserts! Desserts he said... we had to try the creme brulee - my FAVORITE dessert ever! and it was burnt! And undercooked at the same time! I couldn't believe it. I was so disappoitned! But I didn't let it ruin our great night.   We still talked until most of the lights were out. And we laughed over everything. It was a great night. I'm so glad we went. The food was as good as I remember it. To my yelpers I say GO!! but skip the creme brulee!

One evening while waiting for our movie to start, I heard a loud shriek.  "CHERRRRRRRR!"  Quickly I turn around and see that the fudge that was all about... "Oh hey... Hi Alexis!!" My old friend from college. She worked for Jada Beauty and introduced me to the rest of the staff and offered to do my eyebrows, I realllllly wanted to, but alas our movie was about to start so we chose to come back another day.  A few weeks later, we came back and the deed was done. Mary did my eyebrows (she's the BEST!) and is a Godsend. I love what they do, they take an ordinary cotton thread and twist it around in a way that it plucks your stray hairs out. There is very little pain and no damage to the skin at all. It's incredible.  When they were at the AZ Mills location, it was a lil weird to be so vulnuerable to laydown infront of strangers in a busy mall. And then when they were at the Tempe location off of Mill Ave... it was hard to find,and even harder to find a parking spot... and now they have a happy home in the Westside of town at Desert Sky and another home at Fiesta Mall.   It's crazy to see their business grow. I'm so glad and happy for them. They have great customer service and remember me whenever I come in. Their prices go up regularly but with all their growth it's understandable. Eyebrows $12 & Up, UpperLip  $8  & Up ,Chin $8  & Up, Sides $20 & Up, Forehead $8  & Up, FullFace $40 & Up When you go, have them shape ur brows to your face and ask for Mary. Tell Alexis Cher from CAC said hi and enjoy!

Cloud nine... that's the way I would describe the way I felt right after my first facial EVER! When I entered, they took my name and lead me to their spa area. It was dimly lit and there was peaceful music. There was a dining area for those whose packages come with a light lunch. I met Meghan who is an Aesthetician, massage therapist and make-up artist. I was lead to one of the rooms where I was given this tube top type thing and I laid down in a pre-warmed table,,, I was sooo comfy!!  It was awesome. I had the express facial with a lip treatment. All the wonderful pretty smelling chemicals and her strong yet soft hands manipulated all the oil out of my suddenly smaller pores. The lip treatment burned a lil but it wasn't anything that I couldn't deal with.   I relaxed and resleased some of the frustration I've been experiencing lately. It was ah-mazing. Afterward, my face was so smooth and polished and dewy that I couldn't stop touching it! lol, I looked like a weirdo in the perfume section of Nordstrom all feeling up on my own face! haha! But I am SO glad i came in for a facial, I'll DEFINATLY be back!! With many more in tow. This was earlier today and I am STILL on cloud nine, so entranced that I'm hopping into bed for a nap after I finish this review. I say... GO and ask for Meghan! :) oh btw - all my services were $50! not BAD!! :)

I'm sorry to give this place two stars, but seriously - I HAVE experienced better.   Growing up in Laveen, where there has never been anything but dairies and fields between my house and south Phoenix. To have four lane roads and stop lights is freakin' psycho to me!! Oh my gosh! Besides my Laveen novelty of the whole idea of having an actual resturant in our lil hick town... I do like Applebee's.  You can see me there - very late at night chilling with my friends talking about God knows what enjoying appetizers and refillable sodas. Their drinks aren't anything to write home about - seriously, chili's get it better. Their appetizers aren't as weird as Chili's so I'm glad. Their decor isn't great - come on... I say Applebee's you know what I mean.   But what this place DOES have going for it is it's waitstaff. They are always friendly, quick and occasionally funny. I like their staff but once in a while they have odd lil grabass competitions that I have personally shouted at them to stop. Once they didn't quit and I complained and scored a free meal! (whoo!)   I think it's a nice place, but honestly - it's just your average Applebee's but trust me, there are some Applebee's where the servers are jerks, Thank goodness - this place isn't like that!!  Hope to see you there! -Cher

I just got back from 75 Thai Taste Restaurant and I have a happy tummy! :) the madre and I were rolling around on the west side and didn't want to enter another chain for a while. We couldn't find a decent place to eat in the 75th Ave & Thomas area and then we came across the 75 Thai.   We entered the very new, very clean, very quiet dining room. This place is ran by an older Thai gentleman and his 10 year old granddaughter. The dining room is very well put together with large paintings depicting Thailand and other eastern symbols. I dig the look but I seriously don't dig the quiet. I don't know if it's just because I talk a lot or if it's because I'm a naturally loud person. But everyone in the place spoke in hushed tones. Even me! I wish they could have some music in the background... some Thai music? or something... There was a TV by the restroom showing a show in some asian language. But it was put on mute after a while. :(   After reviewing their VAST menu of over 100 dishes, which covered everything from every colored curry under the sun to  vegetarian dishes, Barbeque, Chinese favorites, and soups that I'm looking forward to sampling when the weather gets colder; I ordered the Pad Thai and my mom ordered the Cashew Chicken... I know I know - not the most adventurous selections, but we never been there before! After many hushed words and several other customers entering the room, our order was ready.   My Pad Thai was decent. Not great, not terrible... but very decent and authentic, I appreciate that. It was hearty and sweet. At times, too sweet. My mom's cashew chicken had a great kick of chili to it. I loved it... my mom on the other hand felt it was too hot and could only handle about a third of it. I'd take a bite of her spicy dish to offset the sweetness of my dish. Both were actually quite balanced when eaten together.   I looove Pad Thai! And most of the other Thai places in the valley are WAY too far. And I hate to say it, but this place earns an extra star because of it's location... however, if it were thousands of light years away like most Thai places, it would only recived 3 stars from yours truely.   Over all, I liked this place because I could tell the grandfather really cared about his resturant and I don't like to quickly write off places that have more than money invested in it. I think I will go back one more time for their yellow curry and Kragai. Plus they have these canned juices filled with coconut milk and Orange Pineapple sodas. They looked pretty rad - gotta give those a go! PLUS Every item is under $11! Who doesn't like that?! Better than the maaaany hooks n chains that plauge this area!

When you walk into a place of business, regardless of what they sell, you KNOW if the people there are enjoying themselves. Earlier tonight, after our Thai dinner - my mom and I went to Circle K for some coffee and soda.   We walked in and my mom started griping and asked if the coffee was fresh or not. The quickly made her a fresh pot. The two attendants kept cracking jokes making fun of eachother's *ahem* skill in bed and other places that I shall not mention cuz I'm a lady damnit!   I started to venture out into the soda fountain and found something unusual! There were a whole wall of frozen treats... think Icees on steroids! and then there were freshly brewed Iced Teas and a freezer full of smoothies and milkshakes that are blended right there to your desired thickness. Go to any QT and you'll see that there. But what you won't see is a mix your own Sports drink machine with flavors ranging from Strawberry & Kiwi to Fruit Punch along with different additives like Ginsing and B12 etc. You can put in as much or as little of these additives. Crazy. and of course the fountain drinks that dispense both coke & pepsi products. I was crazy impressed.   While we waited for my mom's coffee to brew, I held my own taste test with all their mixers and additives. "Hey that shit is BOMB with some fucking Tequilla! We got a baby bottle of some cuervo for you, Que no?" LMAO! I couldn't stop laughing! I never EVER had a gas station attendant try to sell me liquior. "Hey, you can drink the whole SHELF and this bitch still won't be fuckable!" LMFAO! Even my mom laughed.  In the end, I got half sweetened tea half unsweetened tea with two shots of raspberry flavor and a shot or ginsing and a chocolate doughnut. We got to the register and they were still making jokes asking my mom if she would like any hangover medicine, condoms, swisher sweets or porn. Each time we all laughed including the cop that was kicking it with a can of soda doing the puzzle. We all kept laughing, those two guys have the brand of funny that I like. Where they can insult themselves and others but do it in such a way that it's HILARIOUS and you can't be mad about it! And because we waited for the coffee it was free and they also had some 2 for 1 dealy thingie going on on refills... so all we paid was one dollar! for a refilled coffee, 32 oz. thirstbuster and a doughnut. SCORE!  When we left, I was bawling and the cop told us that she'd give them a cavity search for giving us such a hard time,  Cashier #1: "Shiiit I'm still sore from the last time! You need to use more Vasalube!"  Cashier #2: "'ey way, you need to buy me dinner before we can get down like that! I only did it that one time cuz I love a woman in uniform!"  I couldn't stop laughing and then i told her to just  throw them in the Beer Cave. One attendant cracked ONE last joke, "Don't fuck up and do that eh, we'll get FUCKED up before the shift is over... you'll find us giving away free gas and shit... all faded!"   I will DEFINATLY be back just to crack jokes with those two!! They were hilarious! ROTFLMFAO

I gotta admit - this was the first Chinese food place that my mom took me to and I grew up eating Happy Food... but i MUST admit... it's not that good. It's nostaliga that forces me to grant them another star.   Located inside a very seedy and rather run down strip mall on one of the roughest intersections in the city, Happy food has not changed ONE bit since I was a kid, the same tables, the same wallpaper, the same bossy and quick talking cashier. But what has changed is the arcade games they have on one side of the resturant.   There is a large glass topped counter with a box of take out menus and a register as well as their condiments and utensils but beneith the glass are photographs of their many dishes. My favorite is #23 Pork AKA Sweet & Sour Pork. It is simply friend nuggets of pork served without veggies or pineapples and the bright red sauce is served in a styrophone bowl for your dipping pleasure. Their egg rolls are awesome as are the chicken wings. My mom loves their Egg foo young and the cashew chicken. I the sauces of both dishes to be too heavy and salty. But that's just me. Everything on their menu is good EXCEPT the Mongolian Beef - it tastes... fishy. I couldn't even take a second bite. *shudders*  Happy Food is SWAMPED during lunch hour... so much so that they are known for denying orders placed after 11:45AM and it's impossible to get a table there - because they're all filled with patrons waiting for their take out. Sooo... call ahead or wait until lunch hour is over. because it's DEAD after 1pm! lol, I've seen it!  Their food might not be the best in the city, but they have a very loyal customer base who have been going there for years like me! It's a serious hole in the wall and offers decent food at very decent prices!

This place definatly has the potential to be great!!   It's already really very good. I went here once last week for an early dinner with a friend. We didn't know what to expect, but I had faith in fellow yelper Christine O. who knows get asian food. We entered the brand spanking new resturant and entered into the very fancy digs, for the southside - this place is faaaansheee!! lol! The only thing that ruined the ambiance for me was the lamanent flooring. Really? Lamenent, BAD lamanent? I would've preferred tile to that rugged rough looking wood like substance! Oh and the ladies room is AH-MAZING! I almost felt bad for using it! ... almost  I sat down and took my time ordering, their sushi menu is a lil confusing... scary. To tie my friend over until we get a chance to order our "real" food, we ordered the lettuce wraps and they were ur standard wraps, but I did like the touch of fresh cilantro and their plum sauce. It was very nice.   We then ordered the Orange beef and california rolls. Both came out quickly and were yummy! The orange beef was crispy and tender had this amazing sweet and spicy sauce! It was a homerun. The california rolls weren't anything special, but at $4 i'm not complaining! Their prices were very decent, the orange beef was $7 and the lettuce wraps were around $5. We were stuffed and needed a container for only $22!!    My ONLY complaint was there were a few bus boys who were standing around a table near ours and they were just staring at everyone as we ate. Very unnerving, I was THIS close to asking if they had a problem or something!  Our server was VERY nice, he was very attentative and helpful - it was obvious this was his first gig as a server - but he was just the cutest and just wanted us to be happy, so I was impressed. I think that's the word that best describes our experience at Pan Asia Sushi Chinese Fusion - impressed. I was impressed by their look (for the most part, damned fake wooden floors!), their food and their service. I will definatly be back with more in tow! :)  To my fellow yelpers, I hope you do go and give their sushi a try as well as their very yummy orange beef! Their dining area is a little on the cold side, so bring a jacket and enjoy the great food that is about to come your way!

I have a confession to make my fellow yelpers...  I am SO sorry to say this, but I've been hiding a lil gem all to myself. China Buffet is my all-time favorite chinese food buffet. We're always greeted with a smile and a nice autmosphere, I like the sing-songy contempo chinese pop in the background, it's not too loud so it's good.   The dining area is vast and is always kept clean. The uniformed staff are always on the ball - clearing plates as soon as you take your last bite and always offer to refil drinks.  The food is very very good. I love the bbq pork. The sesame chicken & beef n broccoli are favorites of mine as well. Their wonton soup is super yummy! I always start every meal a nice bowl of a couple of 'tons. lol.   But the real attraction for me is the Sushi Bar!! Their sushi is real hit or miss... but is more hit than miss... and since it comes with the meal - it's worth atleast taking a gander at. Their salmon nigiri is always good when in stock, as is their shrimp nigir - but I have had a couple of pieces of bad tuna nigiri, which disappoints me but I still go back and give it a go. When tipped well - the sushi chef will make things to order. The sushi isn't the best in the city - by far, but it is good.   I've taken a lot of people to China Buffet and everyone liked it except for one friend who thought their abolone was gross... but abolone IS gross... regardless of where it comes from.   And so i say unto you, my fellow yelpers please forgive me for keeping this place a secret. I hope you try China Buffet and enjoy your visit. It's one of my favorite places to dine anywhere and I constantly use this place a measuring rod for the new chinese places I visit and they rarely compare.

Two words: White Rabbit  Yes the nectar of the drunken gods, White Rabbit is amazing! Part Horchata, part Godiva white chocolate liquor part goodness!! lol, the Side bar's White Rabbit is the best damned drink I've had in a LONG time!!  Throughout my night at sidebar, i've tried as many drinks as I could - I had several White Rabbit, the Psychadellic cocktail which is made with absinthe that was also very good, the cenphopolitian which is a close 2nd place and the mulberry whisky.   These are REAL drinks, made with real skill. Every one of them was good and that's not just the booze talkin'! I wish they had more of an appetizer menu, i mean come on... heat up a toaster oven and let's get crackin'! but one good thing on the food front - they turn a blind eye when ppl bring in their Pei Wei... So that's good! :)   The bathrooms are dark but also pretty and they have mints(!) in a lil bowl I almost knocked over twice while trying to figure out the intracaticies of my outfit. They also have an uber chic decor that is nice but not so mod that its alienating, but I must admit I'm a lil scared of their bar stools. lol

While getting new gear for this year's Native American Recognition Days Banquet at the Scottsdale Mall some friends and I suddenly got hungry - we kept trying to tigure out what to eat when I broke out my cell and texted KGB (542542) and asked "I'm at the mall in Scottsdale, AZ. Where is a unique yet nice place to have dinner near here?" Moments later I had my answer "Posh. How do we describe Posh? with two words: Improvisational Cuisine". We were hooked!  I, the ever knowing yelper (yelpita to Thomas S.) have already heard of Posh and threw it on my list of places to try... became uber excited and lead the way. the parking is kind of odd just follow the signs from the road! And valet is free!! YAY!! We would've used it but the guy wasn' there!  We were met by our uber cute server (dang! Forgot his name sorry!) and chose to dine at the counter. They liked it but the chairs were a lil uncomfortable for me. I kept almost falling the whole meal.  I sampled a few wines and chose the rose` for a pre-meal drink. The "quiz" before the meal was different. I'm sure other reviews explain the Posh concept - in a nutshell: there was a short list of protiens, diners are asked to cross out anything they DO NOT want to dine on & then list ingredients they do NOT like or are allergic to and based on your answers - your meal is formulated improvisationally (is that even a word?)   We chose the 5 course meal with wine (except for our DD) I said that I wasn't feeling the frogslegs and that I was down for anything including throwing an extra $15 for frois gras.  After we turned in our surveys, the chef came and spoke to us. I mentioned his use of White Tepary Beans. Tepary Beans are a staple in our culture and its surprising to hear about it being used in haute cuisine. Turns out he purchases his beans from TOCA (Tohono O'odham Community Action)'s farms which funds cultural activities for the Tohono O'odham Nation... tiiiight!   On to the food...  There were three of us dining and that'd be 15 dishes!! soooo for this review, I'm only going to be describing my meal.  First was an amuse bouche of Lychee in a light oily sauce. Very good, nice and slightly sweet but a good start. Next came a salad made of cabbage & wild boar bacon (that was marinated over night in DUCK FAT!). The salad was good, small but overwhelmingly flavored with onions. I wrote on my survey that I DETESTED raw and strong onion flavor... so why serve me an onion filled dish?! It was good, which is why I didn't send it back but after a while I couldn't hang and ended up not finishing it; but I LOVED my friend's popcorn soup! the BEST way I can describe it is: imagine watering down grits with chicken broth & adding popcorn as a garnish.   Course 2 was a lightly fried fluke with sauteed baby bok choi. Very good - extremely light. The wine paired with it was ah-mazing! The panko coating was a little too oily but the fluke was still great! I would have like to have seen it be oil poached. My friend had a stuffed quail that was better than Thanksgiving dinner!! I couldn't believe it was so good, I wanted to switch plates!  3rd course was the frois gras... the apex of a great meal. wonderfully seared and served cold... it was my first experience with frois gras... and it was sweet & delicious. It was paired with a sliced strawberry, spun sugar and a light sauce. ITs paired wine was the sweetest I ever had and complimented the dish perfectly.  4th was pan roasted lamb with some kind of greens. This was a little disappointing. As my friend and i recieved the same dish! WTF? Half the fun of this place should be that everyone at the table recieves something different! I asked my meat to be cooked to medium and this was medium-well (boo!) the sous chef even commented saying that the doneness of the lamb made him cry on the inside... I was like "uhhhhh - then why did you over cook it?!" The dish was good, the lamb tender and the greens nicely flavored, kind of heavy on the bacon/pork fat flavor.  Finally dessert. A chocolate pate` with more spun sugar and blackberry sauce finished my meal. Imagine taking a chocolate truffle and striping it of its semi-soft chocolate coating and forming its insides into a baby triangle and u'd have my pate`!   As we were playing Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock (shout-out to all The Big Bang fans!) over the bill we were given flash frozen lemon custard lollipops (yummy!) and a small bag of cookies and brittle as parting gifts. They were great to nosh on during the giggle-filled ride home.   Over all - the meal cost over a $100 a person & was VERY good, there might have been a few errors here & there but we still left buzzed & satisified! To my yelpers I say: Its a pretty penny and the add-ons do add-up but if you're looking for an amazing meal & have cash to spare give Posh a try. Just be sure to sit at the counter for the ultimate foodie experience!

"Have you ever been to Ellie's?" asked my fellow yelper Phil M.  "Umm... yeah, once at the governance center."  "No! Her new resturant. She has a legit resturant in town." "No way!" I exclaimed.  "Yeah, it's somewhere in Chandler. I haven't been, but I thought maybe you have" "hmm... no. I have to check it out sometime."  And days later... I did just that.  Ellie started her business from a humble frybread stand made out of plywood and nails and moved up to the Governance Center's inhouse deli and earned the money and experience to finally open her own resturant with her husband in Chandler. I remember going to her stand in Sacaton and everyone always complimented her amazing frybread. I especially loved her salsa! And when she went to the Governance Center (also in Sacaton) I would love to devour her stews while talking tribal politics with one of my best friends. And the other day, I had the chance to try her new legitimate resturant in Chandler.  Ellie is from the Gila River Indian Community, in a different district than mine. She operates her restuant with her husband who is Mexican and they have combined their cuisines to open Ellie's Native & Mexican Food. It sounds funny to me, it sounds like Native Mexican food, which would be different from the americanized version of Mexican food! but alas... that's not what you'll find at Ellie's.  We came in and Ellie wasn't there. Meh, I didn't really expect her there, but it would've been nice. (oh well) Anyway, I tried the 2 tacos with rice & beans and an extra plain frybread. The tacos are totally Gringo tacos with hamburger meat instead of shredded beef. The rice is way yummy but the beans were forgetable. I've had and made way better. The bread was good. I ordered it plain but the server/cashier offered to bring me some powdered sugar and/or honey... but as always, I chose ONE of those options... not BOTH!   If you're going to each frybread as a dessert... it NEEDS to have eaither powdered sugar OR honey... NOT BOTH! Okay... i'm done with the frybread rant... I'm sure you're all tired of it anyway! :P  But anywhoo... I asked for some honey and he brought it in a lil condiment container which was great because I ate my beans with half the frybread and then after I was done with m food, I broke out the honey and had the second half as dessert. Their bread is HUGE! Oh my gosh! Even by Native standards these things are huge. The bread was what all good frybread is: light, crispy, crunchy yet soft and warm. I totally recommend getting the small container with honey to go with the bread so you too can have your bread as part of your meal and for dessert! :)  My mom had a frybread with beans with a side order of rice. Which she liked but wished we went home and had me make it instead. Oh well...   BUT They have one of those popcorn poppers but it's filled with chips! and you can grab as much as you want and they have these baskets for you to fill them up with and a full salsa bar right next to it. I tried most of their salsas and I really liked the well chopped hot salsa. She liked the chunky salsa.   Overall, it's a nice clean place. The service was good, but not overwhelmingly friendly. The frybread was good but the beans were eh. The tacos were good - but were gringo tacos. I personally don't mind, but someone else might. The rice was very good! I love their frybites. Which are like sopapillas I presume but made with frybread dough. :) The best of both worlds.  To my yelpers: I'd like to say that I'm very proud of Ellie for growing her business from the most humblest of beginnings. It takes a lot of determination to go from literally a shack made of plywood on the reservation to a real legitamate business in town. I hope you give her place a try. Especially if you're in that area. Give her chili (red or green) a try. Enjoy the salsa bar and remember... get honey OR powdered sugar... not BOTH! and enjoy!

After spending the morning at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center, I typed into my cell phone "Where is a unique place to have lunch near the Phoenix Indian Medical Center?" and sent the text to KGB (542542). As we ventured into the hot sun, I recieved my answer...Sacred Hogan Navajo Frybread  *ding!* one of the few Native American resturants in the city that I HAVEN'T reviewed yet!! Let's go!! After lunch plans with one of my favorite Navajos fell through - I guess a Navajo Taco would suffice! :P   We entered the blue and white tiled room and were met by a very tired Navajo girl who spoke of problems with the DMV throughout our meal. We sat down and took it all in, the small glass case with bottles of hot sauce, pottery and earrings for sale; the pepsi frige that held nothing but Shasta soda. Uber rez! lol and the lack of a public restroom (BOO!!)  I ordered a double Navajo burger and my mom got the Pima Taco (beans are crushed  as opposed to the Navajo tacos where the beans are whole) and two teas. We sat down and waited for our tea, which, to our annoyance, didn't come until our food did. We asked for ketchup and salsa and the hot sauce was NOT good. I have no idea what the heck that stuff was... but it wasn't cute. They would've been better off opening up a can of El Pato or Tapitio than dispensing that stuff. I think it was bad. The ketchup was good though! :P   The food itself... was meh. Nothing great. I didn't really read the menu, or I would have noticed that the burgers come with roasted green chilis... something I'm not a fan of... but I chose to just go with it and eat it anyway. The chili brought a nice kick to things. The burger itself was just a burger, it needed something... like CHEESE! I love cheese! :P   The bread was kind of tough... and obviously Navajo... made with the superfind Blue Bird Flour which is like GOLD in the Navajo Rez... women LITTERALLY make dresses out of their cloth Blue Bird Flour sacks! And I could tell they used powdered milk in their recipe, when the edges are significatly thick it's the milk reacting to the hot oil. When the dough is fried when fresh... it creates an awesome fluffy affect... but at Sacred Hogan, there were cracks and flakes on one side of the bread which means that the dough was left out in the elements and not kept covered and moist... which is kind of gross... the dough gets hard and when fried creates these little tiles that are hard and the rest of the dough loses moisture which makes the bread lose its flaky goodness.   My mom wasn't thrilled with her Pima Taco... as a Pima, I guess she oughta know what its supposed to be like! She said it was okay, but the salsa made it not so good. She prefers the light crispiness of FBH, so do I. the ONE thing I like about this place is their lunch special... they will make half a taco, of your choice... for $5!! That's pretty rad!   To my yelpers, I say skip this place. The tables were dirty and grimey and not in a good way... where its part of the ambiance, like Carolina's. The staff stared at us the entire time we ate and complained about their personal problems. The food took over 20 minutes to make and the worst food crime... they brought back the MONSTROSITY that is the Indian Dessert!!  WTF?! No one eats like this on the rez!! NO ONE!! If you want to loose some toes, eat this fucking thig! A whole frybread, topped with a scoop of ice cream, chocolate syrup and cinna-sugar! That is disgusting... i'm sorry. it's gross! These flavors cannot possible be good!! If you want a nice dessert, JUST get a plain bread with EAITHER honey OR powdered sugar!! GEEZ!  To answer Mr. K's question... The FBH uses a simpler recipe of flour, salt, baking powder & very hot water. It's hyper use of baking powder creates it crispiness... and Navajos are not as liberal with their baking powder and some use powdered milk which creates a thicker more rich frybread. Both tribes typically use crisco veggie oil or shortening to fry their bread in, but some of the old timers still prefer good ol' fashioned lard! Navajo frybread is usually smaller in diameter, where as O'odham bread is usually larger, but thinner... ummm... think of Navajos as the chicago deep dish of Frybread... and O'odham as the New York thin crust of frybread!

Went here last night for dinner. The place was very clean and unfortunately - sorta sparse. I guess the South Side doesn't appreciate Hawaiian food like I do. :(   I had the Bulkogi short ribs. They were braised in this wonderful tariyaki-like sauce and were very tender!! I was in heaven while eating it and I tried my cousin's chicken katsu and it was wonderful! I loved it too!! i wish they had a bulkogi and katsu combo... but alas they don't! :( They have a pretty big menu and I needed a few minutes just to read through it all. and I didn't even get through it all! :(   When our food came Steve is absolutely right! Our containers were BURSTING with yummy food! :) My ONLY complaint is that the Macaroni salad has onions in it. I hate onions. but that's just me.   I am totally adding this place on my list of regular haunts. I know it's a fast food chain... but damnit it's GOOD! I look forward to trying the Span Masubi!! It's a giant piece of nori wrapped sushi made with SPAM!! How could that be bad?!?! I also want to try the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Noodle Soup. :)   to my yelpers, I say GO! i know there's another location Phoenix... but if you're on this side and you want to dine in a clean and you're REALLY hungry and want to be REALLY full... and you love BBQ like I love BBQ and have a few extra bucks to spend and are willing to give a fast food chain a try... then give this place a try! Where the grill is always hot and the surf's always up! :D

Best... Steak... EVER!!  That's it. Those three simple words sum up my experience this evening. Oh, you want more?! Okay!!  Upon entering the brand spankin' new Lone Butte Casino on my rez.. the Gila River Indian Community, one can find new slot machines, a lounge with waterfalls that can make someone drunk just from staring at it, fresh clean(ish) air... and my favorite amenity... the Verona Steakhouse!!  Entering the nice clean and dare I say it... swanky Chophouse Steakhouse... is both casual and fine dining. Grandma's in their Blue Light special tunics and oxygen tanks sit enjoying enormous Cesar salads that was made table side (!) by well trained servers. I looooove the decor! I small found small touches that reminded me of home, the tortoise shell ceiling that melded traditional Pima basket designs with Italian decals, interesting.   There's a nice mural and huge windows that with Cafe 24/7 encircle a very beautiful fountain. (I'm assuming this is to recreate a whirlwind design, which is a well known symbol to my tribe, "all crazy times are a whirlwind" - Pima proverb) If you're dining indoors, especially in the day time its very nice to have these huge windows, I kinda wished we were sitting by one of them!   Our server Jessica presented us with some bread and made a dipping sauce made with Bellagio olive oil, balsamic vinegar, freshly grated parm and cracked pepper. Lovely. I couldn't get enough!  I ordered the 12oz Rib eye with Squash w/pancetta for $25. I was very specific with my steak. I ordered it pan-roasted to medium and finished with butter, served with a side of blue cheese. And I got it medium and grilled on the salamander. I was disappointed when it first hit the table, and then I took a bit... oh em.. gee!!!   Never, EVER - have I had a steak THIS good!! Tender, perfectly chard, flavorful, beautifully seasoned and well rested. The sign of any great steakhouse is in how well they rest their steaks before serving. I couldn't believe it was so amazing... but I can't help but to wonder how it would have been if I got it the way I wanted it! I also can't help but to wonder if the chefs in the back knew better than me! I did tell the server that the order was wrong... but that I was happy and didn't need to have it fixed or replaced. She was relieved and waited on us hand and foot afterward.   My mom got the Special. An 8oz Filet Mingon with asparagus, roasted potatoes and eggplant ragu for $27! She ordered it well done! (ARGH! I know I know... ugh, some ppl! :P) But it was very good... even if they ruined it to her specifications!   We ate to our hearts content and walked away very happy with our meal. I ran into my biological mom (long story) and her husband celebrating their wedding anniversary, I told the waiter and he hooked them up with a free dessert! How awesome is that?! The manager walked the front of the house asking everyone (including us) how our meals were going. They pay attention to the small details, which is something I notice and appreciate.   I may not be able to afford it ALL the time... but I will DEFINATLY be back with MANY more in tow!! I wish they were open 24 hours like the other restaurant at the Casino, but alas - they have lunch and dinner service only. To my yelpers, I say... GO, GO NOW!! What are you waiting for?! I don't care if you're not in the area... GO! Its not THAT expensive... quit crying! :P Go and enjoy yourself!! Try some wine and give the Cesar salad that's prepared table side! And don't forget the cannoli! I hear it's yummy! And be sure to play a few slots on your way out! ;)

Okay... I love LoLo's. I think it IS better than Roscoe's. I live for their Red Velvet Cake. I DO love most of their food and usually the service is great... so why the two stars? Because I'm not a fan of THIS location. and here's why...  - The crazy hours. I never know WHEN this place is open, sometimes the sun isn't even set and it's closed and other times I go by and late at night and they're open. It's very inconsistant and frustrating.  - The loud azz sound system blaring in the background makes it hard for me to hear the person I'm dining with. So usually we just eat in silence while the music plays on. - The food simply isn't as good as the original location. Everything is a subpar immitation. The chicken is usually overcooked and the waffles lack that certain crunch or crispiness.  - and my own personal reason - I had hit up Lolos on twitter and said they should have a separate to-go menu and I even said on twitter that we were dining at the counter and it was way facinating to watch the food come from the window. Which it was. I liked it, they were cranking it out and were having a good time when in comes this manager who started barking out orders and basically bullying the staff. I thought it was unfair. and then I got the bill... and was misbilled. I told the waitress who didn't do anything about it and ran my card. I asked her to fix it before running my card - she didn't. I didn't sign my ticket and asked the bully of a manager (who was bald with a tan shirt on June 10th) and then shrugged off my complaint and didn't change it. He didn't even look at it. I was astounded. I didn't know what to do - so I entered my tip and signed my ticket and vowed to never return to the Scottsdale location. oh and before we left, the Bully of a Manager asked me if I wanted a to-go menu, I said yes, thinking it was so serendipidous but when he handed me a regular menu with this shitty look and scarcastic tone he said that THIS WAS their to-go menu... and that's when I knew... he had read my tweets.   I didn't mean any disrespect, honestly. It WOULD be awesome if they had a to-go or catering menu. There will be feedback from customers. And I don't care HOW good your food is, nothing warrents such rudeness to a PAYING customer. I think success had gone to the manager's head and they forgot how to keep it real - one of the drawbacks of being "Hood-rich" as the waitstaff's t-shirts declare.   To my yelpers I say: Be careful of what you tweet. The manager at the Lolo's Scottsdale location is sensitive so perhaps you should just save your opinion for yelp. And as for the food... imagine you found Lolo's recipe book... and you tried to make yourself a little feast, you did everything EXACTLY as it says, but it misses something... some pizazz, some flavor, some... soul? You will have the Scottsdale location's food down! Stay away from the Scottsdale location. i will keep to the Downtown location where they keep it real

My new favorite Breakfast place near my new digs in Tempe, Suckerpunch Sally's serves up awesome REAL food with rockabilly flare!  I've gone twice since their weeks long "soft opening", Sally's is open 24-7 for all your eating, drinking, and dancing needs. I have yet to experienct the later two ammenities but I am WAY impressed with their well stocked bar.  This non-chain (yay) serves some awesome breakfast. My first visit featured a two eggs done over hard with bacon and hash browns. along with french toast and a side of english muffins. The entire meal was awesome! I loved it! perfect bacon, great eggs, perfection!!!   The second time I went, I got the hash and eggs. The ONLY blip was that it had onions in it, but I guess that's standard for REAL hash and not the cat food-like hash from a can I grew up on! lol... Even though I hate onions, it was so good that I kept picking at it (avoiding the onions!). I  ordered some sausage to make up for the hash, the sausahge tasted freezer burnt. I didn't like it. The flavor was good, but it wasn't stored correctly which is why it tasted burnt.   In spite of these lil bumps in the road, I still really really like this place. I don't know if its because the menu boasts so much diner comfort food at decent prices (especially for Mill Ave) or the fact that its decor is so rad with its rockabilly vibe that is like the 1950s on acid! I love the tin roof and the silver glitter booths! oh.. and they have FRYBREAD!! I haven't tried it yet, but I'm seriously looking forward to it!

In a sentence: Culinary Dropout is a foodie mecca with its plush and lux furnishings, amazing location in the heart of Scottsdale but away from the duche-ery of Old Town, on point entrees that range from classic to what I call contemporary chef-y food, and its trendy lil touches like dishtowels for nanpkins and placemat menus.   After a short afternoon of shopping, I and the other Musketeers ventured into CD in search of yummy goodness... we weren't disappointed. We scarfed down the Pretzel and cheese fondue. Sorry, I can't remember the exact cheese used, but it tasted like cheez whiz without the nasty chemical aftertaste.   Musketeer #1 had the Shrimp Po' Boy sammy and was overwhelmingly awesome! With its fresh baguette, crispy shrimp and cole slaw topping, this po boy claimed to have died several times. The fries were good, I'm sure they are awesome with the steak. Musketeer #2 had the truffle egg scramble. She said that it was good... not bad... but not terrific. We love the truffle, and this did deliver however... it just missed something... je ne sai quai... just something. I stole a bite and concurred... the low point in a overall great meal.   and me, Miss Musketeer #3 had the coq a vin... a MUST! If that or braised short ribs are on the menu... they MUST be ordered! That's the rule my friends. My braised chicken was good, kind of on the sweet side, but over all very good, although the chicken did have an odd texture, it seemed to me that it could have used a few more hours in the oven. I think this is a dish best served before closing when all the flavors had their chance to really marry. We arrived at the top of dinner service and so the chicken was done... but barely.  Musketeer #2 and I both NEEDED bread and butter, our cooler-than-thou waiter was happy to oblige, even though it took a VERY long time t find him to ask for it in the first place. We capped off the meal with their "famous" Monkey Bread, it was definatly worth going bananas over! Warm, gooey, delicious and crazy sweet with its pull-apart goodness it didn't need the ice cream it was served with, but we certainly weren't about to send it back! The three of us died over that one!   To my yelpers I say: if you have the cash to spend (three of us cost a lil over a hundred clams), a few hours spend on dinner (we were there a while) and a NEED to reach foodie nirvana in order to keep from jumping off a cliff into the chain resturant valley... then this is the spot for you! Bring your most expensive IT bag, a pair of oversized shades, maybe a sweater (the outdoor heaters really didn't work) and your most predestroyed designer deconstructed jeans and get ready!! It's gonna be a blast!!

So there I was... on week three of my semi-vegan, all whole foods, mostly organic, low-sodium and low-sugar diet and I was pissed.   Angry and frustrated with the way things have been happening lately. Two major fights in two days... doesn't make for a good pageant week, but whatev' it happened. Not wanting to relive everything, but KNOWING I was about to... only one thing came to mind... I want an effing HOT DOG!  Now, I live within walking distance of Ted's Hot Dogs, but it was closed, I tried to think of somewhere that was open... a spot came to mind: perched on the south west corner of Priest and Baseline, across the street from AZ Mills Mall and a lil down from Carls Jr. sat the gleaming cart of happiness... La Katra Hot Dogs. With its Sonoran Dogs, bottled mexican sodas, plastic tables n chairs, and small tv showing nothing but Telenovelas, La Katra was the perfect setting for my culinary Wooo Saaaw.   The first time I heard of Sonoran Hot Dogs, the sound of it made me sick. Nothing but unkosher, heavily processed food?! Uhh... no thanks! But I'm so happy I gave it a go because I have been missing OUT! We quickly got our boiled bacon wrapped dog topped with refried beans, MAYO and tomatoes on a steamed sesame seed bun. There is an ice chest filled with other toppings. Things such as: sliced mushrooms, shredded cheese, sweet relish, whole green chilies, creamy guac sauce, salsa verde and parmesan cheese (u know... the stuff in the green can).  I was elated and a little overwhelmed. I asked my friend Beckita which I should use, she suggested the guac and salsa. I obeyed and added relish, parmesan and hot green chili sauce for good measure! I took my first bite and it was... DUH-VINE!  Creamy, spicy and kind of salty. It was soft, yummy and could use some crunch, maybe some crushed tortilla chips on top? Extremely savory and filling. You only need ONE $3 Sonoran Dog. Their Bottles are $1.50 and cans of soda are a $1. They are open daily starting at 6pm and close 1am on weekdays and 2am on weekends. If you have $5 and need some late night food, then this is the place for you! Be sure to top yours with the salsa verde! It's the best!!

Located in a small stripmall near the North East corner of Southern and Central Ave. Is this small buffet. When you enter, you have walk down a small walk way and then are met with a cashier who takes your drink order and counts the number of people in your party. You'll then claim your table and serve yourself. All the usual hits and misses of the average Chinese Buffet are here - none really stand out in all honesty.   They are all pretty average and then came 'the incident'...  I'm still traumatized by it. Seriously I am... I went there and it felt like any other time. I had gotten a chicken dish of somekind. i don't really recall. and I started eating it and it had a very odd taste. I didn't know what it was, it was like chicken... but not really. I then started to eat the rest of it and then I saw different bones that I have NEVER found in chickens before. I couldn't even identify which part of the chicken it was and the meat was very tough and then it hit me.... THAT WASN'T CHICKEN!!  I almost threw up right then and there! I barely made it in time to go to the bathroom and vomit what I had eaten of my faux-chicken. Now I have NO idea what the hell it was that I ate. I tried to ask the cashier and she insisted it was chicken, but then she reluctantly said that it wasn't and when I demanded my money back she quit talking and wouldn't say exactly what the hell it was!   The owner came out and started yelling at me and started yelling in Spanish (there is nothing quite like Spanish in a thick chinese accent!) and wouldn't stop even when I told her that I don't speak Spanish and then I realized she wasn't yelling to communicate with me, but with the other patrons who were starting to look at their own food with concern. I got my money back and bolted out of there and have NEVER gone back!!

So there *I* was...  Trying to get lunch with a couple of friends, a lunch that would never happen. We drove up to find a rugged looking parking lot with signs barring customers from drinking liquor in the parking lot and jäger bottles in the windows, that should've been the first red flag. But we got out the car and saw a woman who said she was the health inspector who was here to inspect the place. We laughed and made jokes but still walked in.   We were greeted by a waiter who seemed to be the only person working and there was only one other table filled in the entire place. We ordered a sandwich, pho, lemongrass chicken & spring rolls. We were never asked for our drink order... Kinda odd move for a bar that happens to serve food. We were nibbling on our spring rolls as we saw the health inspector announce herself and head into the kitchen. Nearly a half hour later we were only served my sandwich and the rest was still coming. We waited some more time and wanted to pay for the sandwich and leave; when the owner came and bagged my sandwich and handed it to me.   We were bewildered and after asking some questions, it turned out their health inspection didn't go so well and they were getting shut down. The inspector didn't even let them make our lunch! I can't say how the sandwich because I didn't exactly feel like eating it. My friend who ate the lion-share of the shrimp spring rolls said they were okay except the lettuce and cabbage was old and browning and the shrimp tasted of cardboard. I'm writing this at the end of the day and happily, I can report that none of us experienced any tummy troubles from the compromised food.   To my Yelpers I say: I can't even tell you to skip this place because they got shut the hell DOWN!!

I have known the owners Cindy & Mitch for a few years now. It was an honor to get to know them and their daughters over the years and to see their business grow. From what started as a stay at home mom making traditional Native American tortillas called "Chumuth" became a bustling and booming food stand. On Indian reservations, food stands are very common and offer homemade delicacies that cannot be found in the city. In the Salt River Reservation, just east of the city of Scottsdale, is The Stand that was named by the community and frequent guests. Cindy & Mitch sell homemade Indian frybread and Chumuth (tortillas) topped or wrapped around red chili beef that was stewed all day, green chili beef that sings a song of savory spiciness; ground beef with shredded lettuce, tomatoes and shredded cheese. It's all fresh, it's all good and it's all hand made.   And when I say "hand made" I MEAN hand made! The dough is made by hand, no mixers here! The pinto beans are sorted and stirred by hand, even the fresh toppings are cut and doled by hand. Recently, I had a true honor of taking the film crew of "Eden Eats" of the Cooking Channel to the Stand, and we made chumuth and red chili and it was so much fun! I hope you are inspired by the show and by this review to go about 5 minutes outside of Scottsdale to the intersection of school and school, Alma School & Indian School (just east of the 101) and try some authentic Native American food!   To my yelpers I say: If you go - be sure to get there EARLY! The stand is only open from 11am - 4PM, but sometimes they run out of food. They are closed on weekends and sometimes they have breakfast burritos in the morning. Their parking lot is dirt, so expect to get your car a little dusty, and there is very limited seating. So be prepared to eat in the car. Just crank up the AC and try not to fall into a food coma... you might affixiate yourself! lol!
