This place is awesome!!! Way better then the Scottsdale location. Went to the AutoZone in Scottsdale first. The guy must have been having a bad day because he was not interested in helping me at all. All I needed was a new headlight and it seemed to be too much of a struggle for him.   Leaving with no parts to fix my car I left that location and drove 5 miles down the road to the Tempe AutoZone and was helped by Karl. He was extremely helpful, even in the 110 degree weather, he made sure the parts I got for my car were correct. From start to finish he was on it!! made me totally glad I didn't just give up on AutoZone all together!!!!   THANKS A TON KARL!

I really wish I knew the young lady at the fronts name but after reading all these reviews on the great service they had from a lady named Sherri working the front... I'm going to assume that's her.   The first time I came in to rent the unit she was extremely helpful and I feel like that isn't a common thing around here. I commented to my friend who helped me move in that I must write a review about her.... Well being as how I was moving it slipped my mind at the time.  But again today I went in the pay my bill and she was just so sweet and carries her self very well.   I've rented from other public storage places before and she has definitely made this place stand out in my mind by far!!!   THANK YOU!

Jeremy rocks! Normally my FedEx experiences' are kinda unpleasant. Customer service is kinda low... Because I feel like they are understaffed BUTTT my experience TWO DAYS IN A ROW was awesome! Thank you for making my 60+ hour work week more stressful then it already is. I appreciate it more then you will know.

So after walking out of the first urgent care I went to because of lack of professionalism on the front staffs part, I was not in the best mood ever. I ended up finding Dignity Urgent Care and let me tell you, from start to finish it was a great experience.   They were extremely fast. Had me in and out in less then 30 min. I waited for the doctor for maybe 5 minutes, he also took the time to show me what was going on by pointing it out on a diagram he had... Instead of just using "doctor terms" and rushing me out of the office.   Not to mention the facility is very beautiful, it was a great breath of fresh air from the place I was at previously! The staff was also very attentive and friendly which made me so happy I did not stay at the first urgent care I visited!   I would strongly recommend this place to everyone who may be having a little health issue! THANK YOU SO MUCH Dignity!

Well, I would like to comment on the Doctors ability to diagnose my problem but since I didn't even make it to see the doctor I am simply writing this review on the fact the staff is completely disrespectful and childish.   When I walked in I went up to the front where two, what I can only assume, are male medical assistants, since their demeanor did not suggest any sort of professionalism. One of them then proceeded to ask me why I was visiting today. I told him I was having trouble hearing out of my left ear.... Now, Idk why that would be funny.... But apparently it was because the gentleman at the other computer burst into laughing... Then looked at the guy, who asked me what I was in for and he then started to giggle.   I wasn't too sure if I missed something. I didn't see anything funny with the fact I couldn't hear out of my left ear... Then I thought... Hey maybe it was an inside joke or Maybe they had a thing against deaf ppl. Not too sure. I then took the paperwork they gave me and sat down... Continued to watch them act like children and make faces at each other, and then I realized I was not going to stay there. I walked outside made a few phone calls to see where else I could possibly go that was local.   After finding another Urgent Care nearby I walked back in the facility, handed them my blank paperwork and told them I was going else where.   I know it seems like it's not that big of a deal, but when you're in customer service you can not act like that. Especially at a place like a hospital, a place where people already don't feel comfortable going, then you make them feel put out anyways.   I'm glad that the place I ended up going had great service and I'm so happy I did NOT stay here and just suck it up.

Awesome experience! Sat at the bar Sunday AM and the bartender and his barback killed it. Being a bartender and knowing how overwhelming stuff can get when you have a full bar and servers are needing their drinks they did a great job. Fun to watch and awesome product knowledge. The 2 ppl I went with got bottomless mimosas for $18 (and you didn't have to buy and entree like most places) and they were on top of refilling them... Even when they were extremely busy. Definitely will come back for the service alone! Thanks guys

Bartender was great.... But our order was messed up. We had to wait for it to be redone which would have been fine.... But we did not receive anything for our troubles. We had to leave and we then had to wait for our order that now had to be a "Togo" bc of the time crunch. I just don't understand how this should be put on the guest and make us suffer. Should have compted something off at the very least.
