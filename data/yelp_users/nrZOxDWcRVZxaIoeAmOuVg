Oh man, you know I love me some Fibber Magees. I found this place the first day I moved to Mesa, and I never looked anywhere else. Some of the best bartenders around- Clayton, Will (who's not there anymore, but dammit he should be), Scott, the list goes on. None of them are any less than stellar. And the atmosphere is as close to what I think of as a real Irish pub as I've ever found.   I know what you're thinking- wooden floors, Guinness and an Irish sounding name, and you've got yourself an "authentic" Pub. Nay nay- I looked into it, and one of the bar's owners is from Ireland directly. It's a PUBlic house, meaning yes, you can bring the kids, and nobody's getting offended. Everyone's just getting well fed and having a great time.   Now let's talk about the amenities people- all drink and no play makes Joe a sad boy. At Fibber's, the games abound. They have 2 pool tables, a few arcade games in the back (Buck Hunter and Golden Tee), 3 dart boards, live music all the time (including a Sunday Afternoon Irish Jam), and multiple large flatscreens so you can catch the game, too. This place is almost always a great time, and when it's not, it's because everyone's recovering from the night before. If you want to come and chill out, have a cold one and not be in a meat market on a Friday night, look no further.   Also, they have some of the very best food I've ever eaten in a bar. One word- BURGERS. Before I went vegan, this was the Mecca, the Holy Grail, the Eden of hamburgers. But their flatbreads, their fries, their salads- everything on this menu is amazing. Don't miss the Fish and Chips- make a night of it. Hot wings rule here, too. Oh yes, and they have CHAMP. If you don't know what it is, Google it, order it, eat, repeat.   Fibbers, please oh please move to Portland. Marquam Hill specifically. Until you do, Arizona- you better treat them nice.

Ok, real talk time. This is a sports bar, and they also run OTB (off-trck-betting). That's a thing, and that means there are some folks in there just to watch the races and bet, maybe grab a beer and that's all. Does that bug me? Not one bit.   As far as the bar and restaurant portion is concerned, this place is everything I like. The bartenders and servers remember my name, what I drink, always smile when I come in, and have a blast doing what they do. They play all my games (NFL, MLB, NHL and even EUFA Champion's League and MLS). If I want to watch something near where I'm seated, they always do their best to accommodate. Couple that with cheap, cold beers, strong pours, and really decent bar food, and you have a winner.   And let's talk food. I'm a vegan, and it kills me to sit near the kitchen. The wings smell amazing, the sandwiches and burgers are piled high, the fries are hand-cut and awesome, and the things I do eat - the fried zucchini, chips and salsa, etc. - have been great. Mikey, one of the cooks, pulls double duty as a great cook and storyteller. He's one of the things that makes the place fun to spend time at.   I've read some of the other reviews about bad service - I've seriously never had any here, and I have a hunch half of them aren't legit. I've come here when Charity, Amanda, Destiny, Boston, Nick and a few others were serving, and honestly I've never waited more than 2 minutes for a drink - and that was when they were slammed. Food has always been good, and fast, and filling. Charity is freaking awesome, and Boston knows every game's outcome before it happens. He's like Rain Man or something, an absolute riot.   Bottom line: If you're looking for a white-glove one-on-one service experience, go to one of the foofy places nearby. Want an awesome sports bar with good food, drinks, people, music and a fun atmosphere? Get here, and I'll buy your first pint.

Went in to finally upgrade my cell phone. I guess I got tired of hearing the giggles and scoffs when I tried to use this brick of a thing to make phone calls. I don't like agreements, I don't like salesmen (on account of I've been one for most of my life), and I definitely don't like being sold.   Luckily for me, the guys here are really straightforward, not overly pushy, really seem to know the products, and frankly, did a really good job. I came in and worked with Joel, and then, true to form, I balked at the price and left. Went next door to the Verizon Store. After waiting 20 minutes to even get noticed over there, I went back to Sprint to make a deal. Joel was with a customer, but the store manager Ryan actually came out and answered all my questions (of which there were many), and in the end we bought two new iPhones and a decent unlimited plan.   I guess what I can say is that the customer service is way above what I've experienced before, the staff is knowledgeable, and the pricing is actually pretty fair to boot. Highly recommended.

Met up with a bunch of our friends for our "Getting The Hell Out Of Arizona Forever" farewell shindig. They were really accommodating about us not being sure how many would show up. We had to add extra tables, and all had separate checks, and they were totally cool with it.   The good? The BEER! I mean, come on people- it's freaking Nimbus. I don't think they've ever made a *bad* beer. And surprisingly, it's not as expensive to get a pint here as it is to get it in the store.   The bad? Just like all of Arizona (cultural wasteland that it is), they don't understand what veganism is. When I order a veggie burger, and I'm incredibly clear on why- going so far as to say that I don't even want the bun grilled, just in *case* they use butter- I get to be pissed off when they serve me a turkey burger, and tell me it's veggie.   Yes, you read that right. They served me a TURKEY BURGER. I mean, I get it- turkey burgers? No substitute for beefy goodness. But it's STILL MEAT. I know I don't eat it anymore, but I think I know the difference. So I demurely spit the meat into my napkin, and call the waitress over. I ask- are you SURE this isn't turkey?  She goes in to the kitchen, comes back and promises me it's a veggie burger. I don't want to ruin my last time hanging out with my friends in AZ, so I nod and say ok. But this absolutely ruined the day for my wife and I. If it wasn't for the beer, it would have been a complete loss- but then, that's what beer is supposed to do. Make bad things better.   So to Nimbus, I say I'll keep drinking your tasty brews, but teach your staff what vegan means. It's actually kind of a popular thing these days.   And one more thing: tell the dude in the monkey suit to leave people alone. I just about knocked him out.
