Delicious. Everything on the menu is good. Nothing is over the top amazing but in general you will have a really good meal here. This is one of those places where if you are in the area go here but if you are across town it's not a place to drive miles for!

The bean and cheese burrito is great but the carne asada is the true winner! Put it on anything and you will be happy you did.  Unless you love a full on douse of cinnamon avoid the carnitas.

If you have a dog that needs basic weekly grooming (like mine who will manage to get dirty even if he's spent the whole day lying around) this is the best place! I hate washing our dog at home so this is heaven. The service is great and they are wonderful about checking in to see if you need more shampoo (which I always do) or towels, ect. It's always clean and well lit as well. If you don't mind washing your own dog but hate that wet dog smell that is always left behind in your home then this is your stop!

Seriously this was terrible, a real shame as I had heard that the original location had some of the best Mexican food in Phoenix.  My husband and I love authentic Mexican (not just the cheese and sour cream loaded places you find around town), so the menu looked promising,  BUT...don't waste your time here.  My chicken was inedible and my husband's soup was really watered down.  Plus the service was atrocious for a place that was not busy when we were there. Shame.

The place was delicious!! The tres leches cake was the best I've ever had. The chorizo fundido and the pork belly tacos deserve honorable mentions.  Our server was very attentive and quick to attend to us.    The huevos rancheros had good flavor but my egg was slightly overlooked and it had too many beans.    Nonetheless, I really hope this place sticks around. It's great!

Basically it's an Asian Food Chipotle. The food is fresh and they offer a lot of great combos the ingredients felt fresher than Chipotle but they skimp you on the sauce. I liked my fried tofu but my husband didn't enjoy his spicy version. Overall if you're in the area I would say go ahead and stop! However, I would not make a special trip for it.
