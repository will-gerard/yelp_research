Where has this place been all my life?! Food was amazing I've never tasted Chinese food like that. We ordered the sampler and orange chicken.  We will definitely be back employees were very courteous and nice.

I had my wedding here. They were great we had correspondence throughout the entire planning phase. However they don't offer many services for weddings. We had to find our own DJ, Photographer, Officiant, ect. However they cater there so we had limited choices on what we can choose from. There is no way to taste test the food prior to your selection either. Same for the Cake they make them there but they only offer whipped cream frosting and fresh flowers to put on top, bring your own topper and ribbon to put around the cake as well. I had my wedding upstairs where the lighting is not to good either. But I have to say my friends and family loved the place, they are still telling me on how that was the best and most fun wedding they have ever been to. So for the price this place is the best! But be prepared to do quite a bit of the work yourself, its not an all inclusive package like you can get at some other places around the valley. But to do it all over again I would still pick this place.

Pharmacy was very helpful at 3 am when my child had an ear infection. The prescriptions were filled quickly. The only place I go for middle of the night emergencies.

Dr Baker gets 5 stars... He is amazing he's helpful and listens to you. He doesn't walk in write something and leave. He knows what he is doing. I went to him for 4 years and then I was in a car accident and I called and asked to get seen after being discharged from the hospital. The staff said I could only see a physician assistant about it. Which was fine I just have never seen one in the office before and didn't know any of them. The woman I met with wanted to know what was going on so I explained my injuries (which were clear) and gave her my disability forms. She filled them out and sent them in. I went back a week later to get the staples removed from my injuries and talked to her about the disability forms from my employer because they say they received incomplete forms. She said that's "not her problem, and I need to know what to do, she has other patients to see, she told me I should be more responsible for the forms" and left the room. I left in tears, I was looking for help and got snapped at. I haven't been back since. The front office staff was always rude and they always seemed like they had some entitlement issues. I have a new office I go to now. Not one of them are as good as Dr Baker but everyone else in his office keep me away from there.

Our family loves this place. We all love the flavors. However this location only sometimes has oreo toppings (big deal for my child). But it doesn't stop us from going.

So professional! Great selection! Made dress buying so easy, they are open on Sundays and carry Maggie Sottero. I was only interested in this designer.  I purchased in 2012 drove from south Chandler to go to this place and it was worth every penny and time I spent driving there for alterations, I would recommend to anyone searching for a wedding dress. I do need to warn though, my bridesmaids looked at dresses there and they couldn't make up their mind or commit to a dress because the sample dresses were all small (size 2, 4, 6) they were more like a 10-12 and they wanted to try them on before purchasing.

My mother bought a groupon so we could get some pictures of my daughter. We called to schedule.... never heard back. Tried to call and schedule next day, mailbox is full. Tried a few days later to schedule, mailbox is full again. When we finally get an appointment and they said that on top of the groupon you must pay $30.00 when booking and the $30.00 will be applied towards your final purchase. We were also told if we had to reschedule, we would have to pay $60.00 additional which would be applied towards our pictures.When the appointment was booked we were told we would receive a call a few days prior to the scheduled time. Never heard anything, so three days prior we call them and *shocking* they don't answer the phone. Tried again 2 days prior, no answer but left a message. Day before scheduled shoot, still no answer. We just wanted to confirm that the appointment was still at the correct time. Then I see all the reviews on google and yelp, I am not going to the shoot tomorrow. Hopefully they will see this review as they don't answer the phone so I am unable to tell them myself.
