If you hate getting messy eating, this is probably not the place for you.  Half of the budget at this place is probably paper towels.  They do not have much on the menu, but what they do they do very well.  Border line 5 review.  I think the only thing holding it back from a 5 is the nature of crawfish itself.  I don't mind getting messy but it is a lot of work for not a whole lot of sustenance from each crustacean.  If I were to go there again, I would probably get the shrimp.  Less work, more reward.  The food comes out in boiled bags which you rip open.  Good idea to use the bib which is provided.  I went for one less than the spiciest sauce, and they were much spicier than used to when ordering at that level.

I don't understand. It is not that fucking great. Give me White Castle.  So...I've given In-N-Out a fair shake. What is the hoopla all about?  I've never gone Animal Style. Is that what I'm missing?  Lines out the door and Midwesterners begging to have franchise rights.  On my most recent visit, the fries were kinda cold - very bland, no salt, just blah.  The burger not much better.  Thin patty in proportion to the bun.  Tasted more bread than meat.  Waited about 15 minutes on my most recent visit, and I have waited much longer in the past.  Always like....WHY??? I keep waiting for some magic that I just don't think is there.  Harold and Kumar went to White Castle for a reason.  Reason being that White Castle is like 100 times better than In-N-Out if you want to loosen your belt on the cheap.  That being said, if In-N-Out would like to grant franchise rights to someone in the Twin Cities - I am your guy.  Please, please, please. It may not be my cup of tea, but it would be like winning the lottery to own one. The cult has spoken, and they are hungry for In-N-Out.  I will delete this review and give the most glowing five star review you have ever seen in your life if you let me open up a franchise anywhere in the Midwest.  The ship is sailing....and it is gone like the wind.  P.S. Just joking Yelp...they are not coming here, anyways.

Lots of hate on here Don't expect the Four Seasons FuNuGyz is fine  Lots of one stars on here.  FuNuGyz is at least a three IMHO.  Been going for several years now.  The beer selection is not huge, but they are very well set up for football Saturdays and Sundays.  Tons of TV's, and they are more than happy to change any of them to whatever game you are interested in watching.  Today, there were Bears fans, Cardinals fans, Steelers fans and this Vikings fan.  Luckily, none of those two teams were playing each other.  Several of the reviews on here have talked about the ownership/management change.  It does seem like the menu is different since I was here last in April.  I think the menu used to be more extensive, and there was a Sonoran Dog that I had in April which was AWESOME and is no longer there.  However, the Philly I got today was solid.  The service was also great.  The bartender remembered me from the last time I was there in April!  Super attentive and friendly.  Beers were on auto-refill until I cut her off.  I'll be back next time I am in AZ!

Caribbean, mon! Some water in the desert. Get the chili dog!  Dillon's is a chain down in Arizona.  BBQ is their specialty.  Kind of like the Famous Dave's of the Southwest.  Have been to the Glendale location in the past.  Solid.  This place brings it to another level.  Situated on Lake Pleasant, just outside of old timers land in NW Phoenix burbs.   They have a vernicular to get you down to the Lake? How cool is that? I am sure that I will appreciate that in my later ages when I retire down there in my golden years.  Look at the old guy getting busy!:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dillons-morristown?select=wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA#wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA  Anyways, their chili dog is out of this world.  See my picture.  Comes on a hamburger bun with two sliced dogs, topped with cheese and jalapenos and BBQ pulled pork.  Just died and went to heaven.  Gives the Gopher Bar a run for its money. 4.99999!

In life, you get what you pay for.  If money were no object to me, I would stay at Cosmo every time that I go to Vegas.  Decided to break the bank and stay there on the last two nights of a four day trip.  It is without a doubt the nicest and trendiest hotel that I have ever stayed in.  Ended up in a terrace studio on the 57th floor with a view facing south towards Luxor and Mandelay Bay.  Jumbo flat screens in both the bedroom and the front room.    Walking around the property, I felt like was in a modern-day Logan's Run.  The vast majority of the clientele here is young and good looking.  You may give yourself whiplash when you first get here, but within a couple hours you should be completely desensitized to the extremely attractive members of the opposite gender walking around.  All of the restaurants I have been to at Cosmo I have thoroughly enjoyed.  Didn't go to the Wicked Spoon Buffet this time, but have been there before and it was awesome.  Two rather affordable options are Secret Pizza and Holstein's.  Secret Pizza has authentic New York pies for five dollars a slice.  Holstein's has great burgers in the ten to twenty dollar range.  Also, you have to try the W.W.E.D? ice cream drink at the Neopolitan by the pool.  It is heaven in a glass.  Probably stay somewhere cheaper in Vegas next time I go, but life is short and you gotta treat yourself once in awhile.

Place is bomb dot com Must visit when in Phoenix In my top five joints   Long before Yelp or the Travel Channel, my go to source for finding the best places to check out when travelling was a book called "Eat Your Way Across the USA."  I think this was only one of two places in Arizona that the book featured.  Went to Richardson's for the first time in probably the late 90's or early 2000's and have been hooked ever since.  It is among my absolute most favorite restaurants.  A couple years back, the original location was destroyed by fire.  This was my first time in the new location which is right around the corner from the original spot.  The interior looks almost exactly like the old location.  They now have mandatory valet, though, which I am not crazy about.  In the past, I have gotten the huevos rancheros and the enchiladas.  Best I have ever had for both.  Today, I got the Trio which was Swordfish, Salmon and Mahi Mahi.  Came on a tortilla with asparagus and carrots.  Outstanding!  They have five dollar mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch hours.  Had one mimosa and one bellini.  I wish I had just come to Richardson's straight from the airport when I arrived last Tuesday.  It is that freaking good!

I am a thrill seeker. I love roller coasters.  I have bungee jumped and I did Terminal Velocity at Wisconsin Dells which is a 100-foot free fall into a net. That being said, I was scared about doing this. Just the sheer height - 108 stories is daunting.  One of my traveling companions suggested doing it a couple months ago. My initial reaction was no way. Then I saw the youtube videos and thought ok. Then the day came and got there and initially decided not to. Buddy did it and heard him and others talk about it being fun and not all that scary once you let yourself off the platform. Agreed, gotta psyche yourself up to jump but once you jump, you will enjoy it. Taking the plunge on this ride was definitely worth it. Scariest parts are standing on the platform waiting and at the end when you feel like you are coming in hot. Although it is a controlled fall, it was still an enjoyable rush. If you are thinking about doing it but have reservations, go ahead and do it. You will not have any regrets.

This was probably my favorite buffet in Vegas, but I have not been to a whole lot.  Most of the options are tapas style.  Small servings of prepared dishes in silver hot pots.  Several were very good; I enjoyed the barbecue shrimp and grits the most.  They have several very exotic dishes, including pigs tail and bones marrow.  I tried the pigs tail and it was not for me, and despite being a fairly adventurous eater, I could not bring myself to try the bone marrow.  The highlight was the gelato at the dessert buffet.  Probably about 16 varieties.  The PB&J was awesome.  However, the server at the gelato station makes the Soup Nazi look like a real sweetheart.

This place fucking blows.  No beer. I repeat: no beer.  No poker, either.   There is not much good to say about this place.  It is in the metro with a convenient location for West Valley residents. There, I'm done with the good.   On to the bad. It is tiny, really tiny.  Most casinos I have been to in the Twin Cities are probably five times as large.   There is only one bar in the entire joint.  I walked up and asked what kinds of beer were available. I was told no beer and no alcohol as their liquor license is pending.  Casino with no alcohol? Does not compute, Stephanie.   Even if they had booze, this place would still only get a two at best from me. No table games. No attached hotel. I counted only six video poker machines. All at the bar with no alcohol. It is all slot machines with many, if not most of them, at the penny and nickle price point.  My arm would seriously need to be twisted to come back here even if the drinks were Vegas style. Welllll.... OK, yeah that might do it.
