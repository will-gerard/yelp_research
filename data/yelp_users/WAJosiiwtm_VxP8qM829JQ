I joined just 3 weeks ago and found out that it had all the amenities and more that I wanted in a total fitness club.   I go practically everyday and partake in many of the group fitness. The entire staff is always pleasant, friendly and knowledgeable.  Management is truly a great reflection of the club! Diana
