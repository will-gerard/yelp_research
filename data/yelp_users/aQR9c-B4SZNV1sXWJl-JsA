Really good food at a great price! If your in the Gilbert area stop by! It's awesome you get to eat outside. Don't recommend going middle of the day in July tho. Too hot out

Terrible customer service! Went in they were busy, ok set an appointment to come back next day. When I came back they said sorry we know u have an appointment but we can't help you if you would like to leave your iPhone over night you can pick it up after 12 the next day?!? Why do you set appointments if your not going to do anything anyways? I had a 740 appointment that they said would be best time to come in and then it doesn't work?!? Will never go back to this store! What a joke!!!
