I gave this place a pass on my first trip in since it was opening day of baseball. Now I have made my second and last visit here. It's a cool little place, and the staff is friendly.   However, the cocktails are served with little or NO pour. I had vodka, soda w a splash of orange each trip, and the drinks are so weak I feel like I'm drinking lemonade. I hear the beers are full tilt, but the cocktail crowd needs to stay clear of this place.

Finally found what I was looking for. Had my fav weekend breakfast spot in Texas, and now found it in AZ.

Food is excellent. We sat at the bar for dinner. Big mistake. Service was terrible. Had the only guy behind the bar serving us. And he could have cared less. Will overlook the bad service, cause the place is great.

I have been struggling with eye problems for almost 50 years. Have been monitored for a Cornea Transplant for almost 10 years. I moved to PHX about 2 years ago and was fortunate to find the Mayo Clinic, and Dr. Shen.   Dr. Shen and her incredible team have exceeded every expectation imagined. When it's time for my appointment, I go in, no long waits. Her attention to answering questions, explaining her concerns, and working with other specialists has been comforting. I am 2 months post op on the transplant, and could not be more pleased on the care I have received.   Thanks to Dr. Shen and her team.

Disappointed that I lived here a year before discovering this place. Was nervous about some of the reviews and feel the bad reviews got it wrong. Very cool vibe, great service. Had a Rainbow and Shrimp Tempura Roll and Sake. Very enjoyable Mill Experience.

The margs are worth coming for. For a place with such a light clientele on a Sat night, you would expect spectacular service.   My observation is that everyone working here has been here a long time, and they could care les if you are having a good experience.   So, matter of fact and cold delivery insures this will be my last visit here, good margs or not.

Hands down the best burger in Tempe. Great flavor, fresh bun, and the fries and cold beer are the perfect compliment. You get to build your burger like you want it. The line goes much quicker than it might appear. Highly recommend this burger joint to the world.

You can drive by this place 100 times and never even notice. However, once you do notice and let your curiosity draw you inside, you will never forget. Amazing food, ambiance and staff. Certainly a favorite.

I have been a long time Chase customer. This review is about customer service at this location.   One star only because that's the lowest. I went thru ATM to get cash. ATM gave $300 of $20s. Went inside to exchange $20s for $100s and was told by the guy at the window they could not do this without running it thru my account.   I asked, you can't exchange cash for cash without running thru my account? He said no, it was a Chase policy. Then he seemed to try to make up some illogical policy on the spot.   I went to a second Chase location and they did this cheerfully and quickly without questions.   What an arrogant ass the guy was at the Mill location. Another customer walked outside behind me and said "your guy must be pretty stupid, the guy at the next window gave me my cash without running thru my account."  Manager of this branch need to pay more attention to training and listening to their customer service training.

Had a great experience. Flavorful margs, and the tacos were great. Friendly service with a smile, and great music, especially when the Michael Jackson remix was playing. Will certainly be back.

One of my favorite things to do in Tempe is to get out on the lake. Well worth the time to check this place out.

Being from Texas, I have grown up on BBQ. I have always enjoyed finding excellent BBQ, and Texas BBQ House qualifies. I looked all over the valley and when I visited this place, I found my BBQ spot. Friendly staff, not a long wait, and just an overall great experience. Highly recommend this spot.

Hope you never have to use them, but if you do, you will get excellent service and friendly faces. They did an amazing job on my Mercedes, and I highly recommend this shop. New to the valley and was glad to find these guys.

Really appreciate the professionalism and quality work they did on my vehicle. Kept me informed and clearly explained what they were doing to repair my car. Got it out on time and looking brand new. Hopefully I won't ever see them again personally, however, I highly recommend.

I love the local mom and pop shops with excellent food. This is certainly one that I will be visiting over and over. Was packed at noon, so got it to go and will be calling in and ordering ahead of time going forward since the chances of getting a lunch seat do not seem to be very high.   Enjoyed chicken and shrimp Pad Thai level 3, and will likely kick it up to a 4 next time. Treasure near work, and a new lunch fav.

Been living in Tempe for about a year and visited several places before finding Liana. I have found what I am looking for. Liana has a very nice salon with a comfortable ambiance. She did a great job and I didn't feel she was rushing thru. She treated me like a client, not an appointment. Thanks Liana and I'll see you in a month, and every month after that.

My 2008 Jeep looks brand new. Alex and Allen were courteous, professional, and delivered on time.   I could not be more pleased and will be a returning client for car washes. I had the Complete Detailing done, and feel the value for the money spent was a great investment in my pride and joy Jeep.   Thanks guys, will return again

Great sliced beef sandwich. I'm a seasoned BBQ lover, and this place hit the spot.  Not exactly like we had back in the motherland of TX, but as good as anything I have found in AZ. Will be coming back to get my fix. The baked beans seemed to be out of a can, but I still enjoyed them. The Shiner Bock was a great compliment.

This place left a bad taste in my mouth, along with service. I'm a little spoiled being from Texas, and near New Orleans where you get real crawfish. This was a $50 lesson, which I am not upset about, I just will not be returning. My guess is I will be seeing something different there in 3 months. 2nd star is for convenience to where I live.

This place continues to amaze me. I eat out often, and go here often. The staff is incredible and well trained. The food is delicious, and the atmosphere is vibrant. No wonder you can't just walk in and sit down.   Please keep this great food, service, and vibe going in the Farmers Art District. Don't know where to point you on food selection, except just pick one.   Daniel, Christina, Kayla, and Tony, you guys rock.

Have seen this place several times when visiting the area, but it has always been closed. Happens that it's only breakfast til 2ish, but I'll be making frequent visits here. Def an add to the fav breakfast spots.   Friendly staff, great ambiance, and delicious Eggs Benedict. Flavorful coffee and a nice Bloody Mary to get the Saturday started.

My kind of breakfast spot. Service is prompt and friendly. Pancakes were perfect. Was having a racquet strung around the corner and this was the perfect place to kill the time and enjoy a great breakfast.

Great experience. Had eggs over easy w some of the best bacon ever, along with a pancake and iced coffee. All were delicious.  Staff was friendly. No liquor license yet for a Bloody Mary, but was told that should be in place soon. This will be a regular weekend breakfast spot for me.

Had to update my review. This place went from great to average in a short amount of  time. I have been going here almost every weekend for months.   My last two experiences have not been good. On one, they were out of bacon, and instead of hash browns, they served potatoes sliced that were undercooked and tasteless. On the other, I recognized that the hash browns were not cooked properly, and the bacon (which was amazing in the past) had changed. There is also a significant drop off in the service. My pancake arrived when I was almost finished with my meal, and not once did they offer to refill my coffee.   You can watch, what appears to be the manager, working away at the counter on a laptop, and never lift one hand to help when it's busy. I feel they are understaffed, have resorted to inferior ingredients, and basically will not survive if they continue with average food and service, when there are so many options.   My weekend breakfast spot is going back  to NCounter, even though it's a bit farther walk, have never been disappointed there.   Wanted Over Easy to kill it since it's so convenient to where I live, but instead, I think it's already dead.
