Great oven roasted bread, and unique sandwiches.  Lacking variety...as does his pizzeria.

On all special occasions relating to ME (eg. fathers day, birthdays), I choose this place for the all you can eat sushi lovers menu.  Sushi quality is certainly as good as any place I've ever been.  It's a bit pricey, but if you do it right, you'll win every time.    One tip.....do the all you can eat sushi special with a friend who can pound it as hard as you can.  That way you can order a good variety and not have to eat entire rolls by yourself.

Don't judge a book by its cover. This is a happening little place. Pretty nice on the inside.

Bandera's Chicken Enchiladas have set the standard for me.  I doubt I will ever find a better mexican dish anywhere.  The mix of Green and Red enchilada sauce is Bomb.com/thebestieverhad

Go here if you live in AZ.  It fills the void in my life being a native Oregonian missing Deschutes Brewery.    I must admit though, I've only been here once because its a difficult place to dine with a 15 month old child.  Might want to get a babysitter for this one.

SPICIEST SALSA EVER!!  I have never left a good salsa bowl empty at mexican restaurant, but I could not finish their salsa.  It was very good, but VERY spicy.    Enchilada was really good as well, but pretty pricey.  I would probably return frequently if it was more reasonably priced.

My favorite happy hour on the planet.    I would travel many miles to get my hands on their Spicy Tuna.

The food is great, the portions are good and the price is right.  The lady who runs the place is very sweet.   Its not fun listening to multiple customers complain about how cheap the owners.  I've been here quite a few times and had to wait a rather long time for my food because they are under staffed.  I'd recommend they invest in some additional labor, and equipment repairs (men's restroom, HVAC).     I'd like to see this place succeed because the food is GREAT and the staff is very nice.

This is a small mexican restaurant that has its stuff together.  very well prepared food, great service and clean.  I recommend the Moreno's Burrito with asada and red sauce, delicious!

Small portions displayed on small plates to give the illusion of more food.   Not flattered.

So delicious.  The butter burger....WOW! and the Culver's house brewed Root Beer is the best I've ever had.    Tip:  The fries kind of suck, so substitute for the cheese curds!

Service was pretty good. Very nice waiter. But the sushi was way over priced. I expected the greatest sushi ever for the price, but it was nothing special.

Good stuff.  My wife will eat here with me.  That says a lot for a small Asian restaurant in Mesa.    50% off Pho is excellent.  Service is always great.

burgers were terribly unoriginal.  french fries came strait out of the safeway freezer section.  the guy working was so hungover it was kind of sad to watch.

Hip hop sandwich shop.  Not a traditional dining experience.  Food was great, and prices were very great.  Everything on menu was under $10.  Mac and Cheese is worth ordering as an appetizer, and the BLT was rediculously delicious.   I look forward to going back again, and probably again.

Scott is a very talented guy. He was great at communicating with me through the scheduling process. He showed up on time and did an amazing job. And charged a very fare price.   Thanks Scott! I'll be spreading the word to friends.

Good place.  I really liked the big tall guy running the cash register.  He seemed to care about the service and product he was putting out.  Also, it was neat to see such a variety of people eating there.  Some didn't speak english, some were in suit and tie.  Food was excellent, but portions were kind of small.

Great place to grab dinner for the kids when your in a hurry and don't feel like cooking dinner!  $5 Hot-N-Ready ALL DAY, EVERY DAY!    But I must give a fair warning...the Crazy Bread is extremely addicting!  I always have to buy 2 bags, one for the kids and one for myself on the drive home!

Salsa was old and fermented...made me sick to my stomach (seriously).  Lunch portions were very skimpy.  Food was nothing better than average.   Was very let down by this place.  How it gets such good reviews blows my mind.

My wife and I have been working with Kelsa for about 2 years now.  She was highly recommended by a friend. I had no idea what to expect, but I knew that I could use some guidance on my personal finances.  Within an hour of our first meeting with Kelsa, I never felt better about my future financial wellness.  After going through the 6 month program, we had overcome some big obstacles and tackled many of our financial goals.  We continue to use her services and likely will keep her around for many more years!   I highly recommend Fiscal Fitness.

This place is hands down the best restaurant on this intersection. Very friendly staff/ownership and food is terrific.   I used to drive all the way to China Magic Noodle to get food like this. I got to say I love China Magic Noodle but this place is equivalent or better. Very beautifully built restaurant.   Bravo!

Very cool little spot in the citrus orchards next to B & B Farms. Brisket, pulled pork and ribs I hear are very good. I had the red chili pork burrito combo and it was delicious.   Look forward to bringing friends and family by on my next visit!

I expect this place to be a big success. Very nice, spacious restaurant with excellent decor. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Food and presentation is top notch. Side dishes we better than I've had at other Korean restaurants and they refilled them for me graciously throughout my meal.   It will be fun to watch this hard working group grow as word gets out about this place.   Best wishes and good luck!
