A fellow coworker recomended University Animal Hospital years ago. I have found them very accomadating, as well as very helpful. When it was time to put my female Shepherd down,Dr Naig, as well as the staff were extremely helpful. I now take my male Shepherd to see Dr Naig and Dr Ware. I find both of them to be very caring. I wish more vets were like them...

Tonight, these guys failed. For a place that wasn't busy, service was bad. (When they normally have been good)
