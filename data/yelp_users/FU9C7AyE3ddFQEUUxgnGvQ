I don't "do" girls night out.  But for The Melting Pot, I "did do" girl's night out.  I went with three girls that I cheered with back in high school.  I mean waaaayyyyy back in high school.  How far back?  No business of yours, sir!  Anyhow, after reconnecting after ...let's call it "many" years... the four of us went to TMP for 'couples night'.  We feigned lesbian love in order to fit into a great special, and I'm not afraid to admit it!  No, really, they didn't seem to care, as long as we were in groups of two.   If you read nothing else, read this:  Plan on three + hours here.  Savor.  Enjoy.  Linger.  It takes that long... it just DOES.  Do not tell your spouse (or babysitter or cat or whomever you answer to) that you'll be home in two hours.  Ahem. Onward! Best highlight of the night for me: the Search and Rescue Spoon!!!!!  This struck my funny bone so hard and it was the topic of many jokes and pictures throughout the night. If you are looking for a place to take kids, do the rest of us a favor:  DON'T COME HERE.  Go someplace where the food is served in nugget form, and removal of shoes is appropriate. We don't want to hear your kids whine or your baby scream.  I have kids but there's a time and a place, people.  The rest of us come to places like this just to get away from you.   Moving on! I could wax fond for hours giving loving descriptions of the food here, I really could.  It was both unique AND delicious.  The experience of it is incredibly fun, the atmosphere feels SO intimate somehow (no awkward eye contact with anyone who isn't at your table) and everything about it just amazing.  There was an "appetizer" course, a "main" course, and a "dessert" course.  You can choose to dip or cook your food in any kind of cheese or broth... but let's be honest, it's all foreplay leading up to to what really matters there:  the dessert course.   We chose the "S'mores" dessert experience.  I'm not being pretentious... it really is an *experience*.  Just think:a giant pot of melted chocolate, swirled with marshmallow cream, which gets some sort of flammable (I'm assuming liquor) poured on top and set on fire, which toasts the marshmallow creme, and THEN they add the crushed graham crackers.... and after THAT we got to dip things like cheesecake, rice krispy treats, poundcake, strawberries, and brownies in the hot melty S'morey goodness... let me just say that I briefly experienced Nirvana. Yes, yes, I hear people say it's expensive, and I guess that is relative.  If you've stayed at the Aria, or in a suite at Mandalay Bay, or anywhere decent in Vegas for a week and paid $40 for a drink poolside, then comparatively/relatively....  it was downright cheap.   (If you get all indignant over anything that doesn't come from the dollar menu at McDonalds, then don't go to Vegas and don't go to The Melting Pot.  Seriously, just stay at home and crab about inflation and watch some public television, you'll be happier.)    As for me, the whole point of working is to earn money that then enables me to go places and eat things and buy stuff for my family.  This falls in the category of "going to a Place" and "eating Things" so I was happy. Once we split up the dinner bill, I felt that my portion (including the completely  optional dessert course and one adult beverage- so if you must be a tightwad you could do it for less than I did) of only $40 was downright freaking CHEAP, worth every last cent and then some... and I can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I love the food here and that it's served hot.  I wouldn't say it's "date night" exactly, but it's definitely TASTY lunch food or quick pick up for dinner if you're in that neighborhood.  I wonder if it is owned by a family, because the same people are there year after year.  I have only one minor complaint, and that is being nickel and dimed to death... if you want a teeny tiny cup of teriyaki sauce, there's a charge.  If you want a refill on your soda, there's a charge.  I'd kind of rather have them add a buck to everything and just act normal.

I have had several great experiences at this Chili's location. But, today was noteworthy. I felt like I really needed to write a review to talk about the fantastic server we had today. Her name was Patty. After being greeted in an extremely friendly manner by the hostess, we were delighted by Patty's attitude, how fun and friendly she was.  Our food came exactly as we ordered, and I generally make a lot of modifications. Not only did she stay on top of our refills, but when she sensed that we were getting ready to go,she brought us to go cups filled with our beverages, without us even asking.   Our food was good, chips were fresh, soup was hot, salad was cold... But really we enjoyed our server the most.

So, here's the deal... and I kind of feel bad for only two stars... We went here for breakfast.  And the breakfast was okay.  It was... well... average.  I'm no cook- I'm a career girl.  But my breakfasts made at home KILL over what we got.  I was expecting breakfasty fireworks and culinary glory after a week of dieting and restraint.  It was a rare Sunday morning alone with my husband... no kids for a few glorious hours... and we decided to monumentally Have Breakfast.   I, of course, consulted my fellow Yelpers, who are generally the smartest, best, and brightest in the world... and having been to Giant Hamburgers for,well, a Giant Hamburger,years previously (which was FREAKING AMAZING) I thought that I could not go wrong in suggesting this place to my husband.  Many Yelpers highly recommended G.H. for breakfast so HOW could we go wrong?  And off we went. Between the two of us, we were able to sample a fair range of food. Okay, so the toast was just cheap bread (think 2 loaves for $1 at a bread outlet... it shreds apart when you look at it sideways) the eggs were very plain and bland... bacon was okayyyyy (and I love bacon with an unholy passion so it's rare that bacon doesn't blow my skirt up) but just cheap, thin cuts, not particularly underdone but not the usual glory that bacon is.  I will say that I did somewhat enjoy the biscuits and gravy, but I would swear to you on any religious book that the biscuits were pre-packaged generic, not fresh/hand-made.   The staff there is truly nice, and I like the personal service.  Saying hello.  Eye contact.  Genuine niceness.  This was consistent with my experience there a few years back, and it hasn't changed.  This kind of services is worth BUCKETS of cred in my book. What I *SEVERELY DISLIKED* was being the only english-speaking people in the restaurant for the last 15 minutes of our stay.  At one point, all the staff were speaking spanish, and after one older couple left, all of the diners were speaking spanish, and it was as though we had been transported to someplace nestled deep inside the manky heart of Guadalupe.  But without great food.  It was uncomfortable enough that we finished up, left some food behind, and bailed a little quicker than we probably would have.  So, although I am a big fan of the Giant Hamburgers at Giant Hamburger... I just didn't feel all the breakfasty love that other reviewers did.

Something about Neds is just BETTER than any other sub place. The bread, the meats and cheeses, the mayo... Oh man. I can't get enough of Neds. Recently catered a party with them and (unknown to me) they'd accidentally shorted the meat on the platter (we still had leftovers) and they called out of the blue 2 days later telling me they had messed up and asking me if they could give me a gift card to make up for it! Who does that?? Amazing.

The hand made buns they put on the griddle with butter (gives it that buttery crusty edge) are probably what makes this place so good.  But I love the flavorful beef, and I LOVE being able to do my own super fresh crunchy veggie toppings. And sauces.  And don't get me started on the hot melty cheese sauce you can pour all over everything.

Having had a fantastic experience at the Gilbert (Val Vista and Williams Field) location with our entire staff for a employee's anniversary lunch, I figured Pita Jungle should be Pita Jungle, right?  And the Chandler location is closer to our workplace, so I called and let them know that two days hence, we would be treating one of our employees to his anniversary lunch.        We would be a party of fifteen, and although I know they don't take reservations, I wanted to find out what we can do to make it less of a surprise for them, and smoother sailing for our healthcare office's staff (we would have a set period of time to eat and get back to see the afternoon patients).      She reiterated they don't take reservations.  I know, sweetie, I know.  I'm just calling to give you a head's up that we're going to show up at noon in 2 days' time and we would like for that to not be hard on your staff.  Or mine.  "Okay," she said, stating she would make a note, "but it isn't a reservation."  Okay, I gotcha.     I called the day before to re-remind them we'd be there in one day, at noon, with 15 hungry people.  "We can't, we don't, we won't," etc, she says.  I know, honey, I know you don't take reservations, I know what you can't and don't do in terms of reservations. Do you ACCEPT larger parties? "Yes," she says.  "So, I'm just calling to see what CAN be done" I say.  "I'll make a note but you can't have a reservation."  My goodness, it's never been harder for me to arrange to drop a few benji's on a small establishment.  The Gilbert location was gracious, had left a few tables in one area free, then scooted them together when our party arrived (just a couple months prior) and had us seated in one minute flat, gracious and happy to see us... so I figured with the ample heads-up, the Chandler location would probably do the same, right?     Right?      We show up, 15 of us, at noon the next day.  The young, male (old enough to drive, too young to drink) host is astounded at the size of our party. Like, he has never SEEN 15 people all together at one time before, ASTOUNDED.  I mention that while we know they don't do reservations, I've called ahead two days, and one day, prior. *crickets* She said she would make a note, let you all know we would be coming so you could plan ahead. *crickets*  To make sure you wouldn't be overwhelmed by our party. *crickets*  Because we are celebrating a much-loved employee's anniversary and it's really important because this is his favorite restaurant.  *crickets*        "Well," he sighs, "I don't know anything about that but it's going to be at LEAST a half hour wait. Is that okay?"        There's no harm in asking nicely, so I did.  "Well, actually, is there anything that can be done? We have about 49 minutes of lunch time left, so that doesn't really enable us to eat, is there any room out on that big patio? There's a large table down the middle of the restaurant that's just the right size for our party, which was completely empty, until you sat two people in the middle of it, like, 4 seconds before we were greeted, could they potentially sit somewhere else? Because we'd fit right there and they don't even have a water glass yet; I would pay for their lunch."        No.  There was obviously nothing he was willing to do, so I let him know that anything they can do is appreciated, because all 15 of us are here, and there's no time to arrange anything new.  So we wait for 19 minutes, and he comes over and tell us "It's going to be at least another 40 minutes, so is that okay?"      No.  That wasn't okay, not even remotely okay, and honestly I expect to be treated like this at Oregano's, pal, but I really didn't see this one coming. Why would you tell us 30 minutes, and 11 minutes short of the 30 minutes, tell us it's another 40 minutes?  You've been seating everyone who came in the door.  I asked if there was a manager. Nope.  Is there anyone I can talk to? (Because I'm thinking as a manager, I see potential solutions to this problem passing before my eyes with every choice you make, friend.)  Nope.         I know the kid is young.  And this is not his place.  And he can't possibly have enough experience to even know what customer care looks or sounds like... but he couldn't have possibly been slow enough to think that, on any level, this was okay.       So, in order to not break my recent goals of never saying reactive things, I simply walked out the door.  Saw Valle Luna just down the walk, and walked in there to ask if they'd seat us.  Sure, they said, come on over!      So all 15 of us mobbed down to Valle Luna, had just about the most delicious chips and salsa I've ever had, cold drinks on the table right away, and hot lunch served up within about 10 minutes, a check and boxes shortly thereafter, and we were back to the office on time, stuffed full of really delicious and satisfying food.  Please consider going there; they were fantastic.

Unexpectedly pretty building along a dusty dirt road, like a jewel dropped amid some dirty river rocks.  We drove past it twice before we found it.  I'm glad we did... The food was good. Chips and salsa were good... Nachos were good... Everyone enjoyed their food... This is one of those places that will "grow" into itself over the years.  To have good quality Mexican food that's not from a blah-bland Generican chain... Excellent.

Such delicious and high-quality meat.  In order of importance:  First, always first: Bacon.   Next, we love the pre-formed and frozen Hamburger Patties (the only hamburgers we will grill).  They also have the filled (with cheese or other deliciousness) patties for you to buy- which are what they serve in their restaurant.  Think: your favorite savory goodness wrapped in a rotunda of mouth-watering-ground-beefness, put it on your grill, enjoy delicious flavor.   Thirdly we buy the chuck roast, which I cook in the crock pot or pressure cooker and is bizarrely tender and delicious.   D) Amazing steaks.  You'll be freaked out by grocery store steaks after you see how quickly these cook and how tender they are... these are natural and high quality, which makes me wonder what the crap they do to the meat at the grocery store to make it grocery store meats so nasty in comparison. 5. Chicken breast.  Huge.  Just... huge.  Dolly parton huge.  And way juicier than grocery store chicken.  Lastly:  Stew Meat which I use to make very tender beef stroganoff.  Or stew.    Prices same/comparable to any grocery store's regular meat prices.   They also have dog bones for you to buy for your Woofie-shaped friends.

Everyone was seriously nice and very concerned with my experience.  The manager is very present and extremely involved. He is aware of previous management's errors, working to fix it.  I was super apprehensive about them after reading the reviews, but they were the closest approved (by my insurance company) rental place, and were able to pick me up right away, and had a truck ready for me to rent.    I recieved incredibly quick service, I was not hassled in any way about insurance.  When I was told by the shop that was repairing my car that it would be a week longer than they originally thought, I called Enterprise to make arrangements to keep the truck I'd rented for an additional week, and decided to drop the extra insurance that I'd originally opted to buy, just to keep costs down.  Again, they were very nice and didn't  hassle me about it one bit.    Then, I decided that I did not like the large king-cab Ford truck that I'd rented from them.   I drove by without an appointment, and explained that I felt like the Ford felt like a giant, slow, gassy marshmallow (sorry Daddy, I know you were a Ford guy but this one was nothing like the Fords YOU drove).  I was taken out to look at what was available, and a Chevy Silverado was recommended as being a little better with handling, a little quicker, and less lumbering in feel.  He drove it around back, ran it through the wash, and it was swapped out for me without a second's hesitation and I was on my way in -seriously- seven minutes flat.  Looking back, I was completely on my guard the entire time for the frightful bugaboo monsters that others have warned us about... and I was slightly traumatized after my car accident, and a somewhat 'needy' customer, and yet they were quick, professional, and respectful the entire time.    Do you need to pay market pricing according to the day of the week and whether it would be over a holiday weekend (as mine was)... yes.  That's NORMAL.  Do you have to reserve with a credit card?  Yes, that's NORMAL- what would YOU want as surety if some stranger was going to drive off in your new-ish car?   And if YOUR car is in the body shop because you wrecked it.... um.... maybe a suggestion of additional insurance isn't such a bad idea.    Just sayin.

I've experienced much better.   I love food, I just LOVE LOVE LOVE me some food.  The food here is... meh.   I've been three times, and my general reaction is 2-3 stars at best for each of my visits.  Hey, can I get that without the green chilis?  No?  What about... can I get this with the sauce on the side?  No?  Can I...? Never mind, she just WALKED AWAY.  After three visits with these folks, I have had a 100% consistent issue with getting seated- and this place actually earned its own tweet (I rarely tweet) because of the consistently snippy, unhelpful, and downright stand-offish response when we try to come spend our $400 there for a group lunch. So... two stars for consistency... that does seem to indicate a "policy" and hooray for you, to be able to maintain such a strict adherence to your policies.  I guess.   It's unfortunate that there's one person on our admin staff that just ADORES this disaster of a chain, thus we end up getting dragged here for their annual "work anniversary" lunch celebration.  No amount of calling ahead to see what can be done to make things go more smoothly for the staff at Oregano's (why wouldn't you want to know that a party of 15 is on its way?) and I've long since given up on trying to make things go smoothly for our staff.    I know you don't take reservations, I'm not trying to break your rules... I'm calling with a head's up to let you know that we have a group coming in 2 days from now.  And when I call ahead as they open that day to let them know, and I get the same defensive reaction.  Again, not trying to break your rules.  Just trying to see what CAN be done- but thank you for the thorough scolding on all of the things that CAN'T be done.  The rule here -*******take note if you're going to be with a group******- is that they WILL NOT SEAT YOU unless every member of your party is there.  That last person who stayed behind to lock the door and then caught the red light?  No, no, we can't seat the other 14 of you, that last, 15th, person has to be here before you can have your table.  I've experienced this at the Chandler location once, in 2011... as well as the Gilbert location twice (once in 2012 and once in December of 2013).    When I was a kid (oh yes, I went there), there was a place in Phoenix called Ed Debevicks (I believe)... it was a 50's New York diner-style experience, complete with waiters and waitresses that would strive to exceed each other in the ways that they could be outrageously, hilariously, rude.  They'd shove you over so they could sit down while they took your order.  They'd loudly chew gum and take a sip of your drink.  They might call you names, they'd for sure snort and roll their eyes, but at the end of the day it was all a joke.  As they were putting on the act, they were covertly on the BALL with your order, with a new drink and refills, with getting your order correct and hot and on your table quickly.    Oreganos?  Well... they're rude.  Aaaand... that's it.  Good for groups: No Good when you need to catch a movie: No Good for work lunch (you have to be done in a reasonable time frame): No  I tried to order Alfredo the Dark with one modification:  Nope. Can't do it.  Okay, that's fair.  I tried to order the Lady is a Scampi: our server said "It's spicy and we won't take it back if it's too spicy".  Well, I like to put sriracha sauce on my pizza, and I order my wings "Hot" wherever I go, but she was so severe, I was worried about dropping $15 and going hungry for the rest of my work day.   I have ordered a Julius Cesar salad with chicken (huge), which was good, but I've had better.  I have ordered the Zany Ziti, and found it unbearably bland.  And I do believe pasta and pizza is like sex... even when it isn't the BEST you've ever had... well, I'm not going to complain.   But... really, really BLAND.  I thought, like some pastas, that it just needed a day to sort of meld the flavors, so I looked forward to having it as a leftover the next day, but it came in a breadbowl, which then rendered it inedible as a leftover the next day.   I've had the thin crust pizza, which was fine.  I mean... *straining to say something nice* ...yeah.  It was ...fine.  So, kids, as much as I struggle emotionally with leaving a 2-star review... that's been my experience after three visits - and next year for my co-worker's anniversary, I'll wish her well and then probably head up Gilbert Road to Joe's BBQ.

Thanks, Yelpers! We loved this place. On our way back from a week in Vegas, where we'd been eating expensive, tiny portions of unpronounceable gourmet fare, we were tired, thirsty, hot, and hungry.  No time to leave things to chance... Naturally, we turned to the collective wisdom of Yelp.   This place was unassuming, with plastic over the tablecloths, folksy-western decor, and a "come on in, pick a seat" greeting style.  No velvet ropes, no snooty hosts eyeing your shoes to see if you're fit to spend your money in their lofty company... So nice.  Christy was our server, and she was down-home friendly, chatty, and genuinely interested in making sure we were happy with our food.  Chips were fresh and hot, and served with three sauces: fresh salsa, a fantastic hot sauce/salsa, and a thin & very authenticly beany bean dip.  We ate too much of this goodness.  I had the #5, taco & tostada. The taco was an honest, legitimate fried Mexican taco, fantastically crunchy & full of juicy shredded beef, then laid on its side, covered in a flavorful red sauce, and then sprinkled with crumbly queso.  The tostada was mounded with the same shredded beef, crunchy cold lettuce, and crumbled queso.  It was served with rice & beans that I really didn't have room for.  My #1 Sexy Husband Man, who is infinitely finicky, had the shredded beef Chimichanga and he was seriously very happy with it.  Our drinks stayed full the entire time, the chit-chat was fun and friendly, and then as we wearily eyed the road outside and prepared to leave, Christy offered directions to the highway as well as two styrofoam to-go cups and sent us on our way with fresh soda-pop and a heartfelt inquiry as to whether we were satisfied.   Yep... And here's the review to prove it.   We'll be back next time we go to Vegas!

I took my daughter in on 11/4/11 for an eye exam, and we ordered her glasses.   They were nice, and we had no complaints about the office visit.  We were promised a delivery date of 11/13/11, which is also printed on the receipt.       We heard nothing, so my daughter called on 11/19, thinking perhaps they just forgot to call to let her know they'd arrive, and spoke with a lady named Joy, who stated she would get back to her.     TWO DAYS LATER, someone else called back (on 11/21) who spoke so quickly and unintelligably that we cannot catch her name, stating that the glasses had been shipped on 11/19 and would be in the store *quote* :   "tomorrow, Wednesday, or sometime this week".   Fantastic!  Impressive.    My daughter called again today, and they are not there.  My daughter is nearly eighteen, a college student and works full time... she is very capable, and likes to handle as much as she can regarding her own appointments, etc; but she has become frustrated and asked me to help.     So, I called midday today, and spoke with the self-identified manager of this location, "Joe James" who looked for her glasses for a very long time, and then came back on the line and said he didn't know but 'maybe we should reorder them because maybe they got shipped to another location'.      I asked him to please call me back with two things:      1. A definitive answer on where my daughter's glasses are, and,    2. What solution he would be willing to offer, if the answer isn't "They are here, come and get them."    Hours later, he callec back and left a voicemail stating "the lab said they mighta got shipped to another store or got lost so I dont know but my suggestion is we probably need to reorder these if I dont receive them by tomorrow, just reorder them as "lab lost" give me a call and let me know what you think, talk to you later, bye"   .... which is NIETHER an answer as to where her glasses are (tracking? accountability?), NOR is it a solution that helps in any material way.       Reordering them, now, nineteen days later, when we don't know WHAT HAPPENED the FIRST TIME, where the break-down in their system is, or who is responsible... doesn't sound like an awesome solution to me.       We have already used this year's optical benefit to order these glasses... I already paid our $95 copay on them... what recourse do I have?    I googled issues others have had with Target, and this seems to be a recurring issue:  once they have your money and your benefit... you've got no leverage and they cease caring about it.

I've been going to Jamie since I was a teenager. I moved 50 miles away and it's MORE than worth the time to drive into Phoenix to see her.  Jamie has been a trainer for high end, premier hair product companies, and uses that knowledge and skill to do amazing things to my hair. No matter WHAT I ask her to do to my hair, it ends up silky, shiny, and healthy. She never does anything that won't grow out well, and when I've asked her to do something to my hair that is unadviseable (because it won't look right with my face shape, skin tone, and now AGE, or if I ask for something that isn't in style anymore, she will TELL me!).  She's smart and vivacious, knows SO much, listens well, dispenses sage advice, and makes me so happy with my hair and feel shmexxy!  My husband LOVES my hair appointment days because I come home feeling energized, confident, and sexy.  Not only do I always have great HAIR... I also consider Jamie a key reason my marriage rocks!

My daughter's cold/asthma turned ugly really fast and she couldn't breathe.  I called at 8pm, they close at 9pm, but was told to come on in.  Arrived at  8:14 pm, taken back at 8:35pm- can't complain about that! Dr's assistant Alana got some Tylenol and a breathing treatment going immediately, before long (8:47) an X-ray tech was in for a chest xray. So far, we are pretty dang impressed.

So... I called a week ahead for an appointment to change the oil in my car.  The drivers side front tire is lower than the others by 8 lbs and I definitely want that looked at during the tire rotation. It's two years old and still under warranty but I felt like the $68 oil change at the Dealership was a little steep and came here because oil changes are advertised at closer to $20-ish.  They have a groupon for $18 so I get it but I'm not new. I know this game, there are taxes and fees and disposal charges and such but still hoped for better.  Because then they tell me there's a $30 up charge for the kind of oil I MUST have, no choice. Okay. Now we are at $50 for the oil change.  So I arrived prior to my appt time with no expectation of them taking the car early, and left my car there.  Went with my husband and son to get the other car washed, make a donation, do some shopping. Returned 2.5 hrs later and saw my car still sitting in the parking lot where I left it. Popped my head in, and they had t touched it. All the excuses from the guy (no uniform no name tag, I don't know how to identify him except he has tattoos visible from chin to wrists) already kind of defensive even though I haven't even said a word. "we are busy, we are shortchanged, I'll call you when it's ready," No problem I said, and we left. Thankfully all of our trip preparation and appointments were manageable with one car, and some creative finagling.  No need to be irritated with the guys at the desk who clearly aren't working on the Cars... And I feel sorry for those out in the heat and getting sweaty and dirty. It seems like a brutal job to me in 113 degrees.  Long story short, we get the call and pick up the car about three (had a 10:30 am appt- just an oil change and tire rotation).  My $18 groupon with the $30 up charge has somehow climbed to a total of $68 and I realize I have not saved PENNY.  Head home and as I drove, I look at the Tire Pressure Monitoring System screen and I see the same exact thing as before. 30-36-37-38.  They didn't rotate the tires. They didn't even check the inflation, let alone check why one was low.  I turn around, drive back, and walk back in. I explain that the TPMS is still reporting the same as it was all week, and that I had mentioned (I suspect a nail or leak and we are driving to California on Monday) when I checked the car in.   He shuffles some papers around with the other guy at the desk and they're both all "well we are really busy and maybe this/that," and I just look at them and and throat-tattoos guy goes to check.  He comes back and gives the other guy a look and that guys says  "OHHH, well, the back tires are better than the front tires so he left them there, it's better that way" and I said, "But I asked when I checked in.." And went thru my request to have the tires checked, the TPMS readings, etc. Then they're both (like they did me a huge favor, and what with my girl-ness and thus obvious inability to understand about complicated manly things like Tires) telling me how it's better not to rotate the tires when the back tires measure 9 in wear and the front tires measure 8 *eye roll*, so I point out that the rotation is on the work order at a charge of $29 so would they please just take care of rotating the tires and the inflation, we are taking a road trip and we need to be safe. I get the equivalent of one of my teenagers "Fine." ...stamp... Flounce...  Okay. So I sit in the "reception" area which, charitably, is at least 87-88 degrees and packed. Other people are having similar service issues as I wait.  In the end, it is a dingy, poorly-run place.  The groupon is likely because return business has got to be slim-to-nonexistent. I paid every PENNY what I would have paid at my dealership (power Nissan) $68- where they either get my car in and out in 40 mins, or give me a courtesy car to drive, whichever I prefer, do a careful thorough job, and wash my car before they give it back. I'm sad I strayed and my lesson learned.  I gave 2 stars because (one hopes) the oil was technically changed (?) Although I truthfully have doubts about even that.

No matter how far away we move, we have to drive back. It's the sauces and salsas. MMMMMM !   We have to drive a significantly inconvenient distance to get here, and I can't help it.  When I want to have goosebumps-all-over Mexican food, no matter where else we go, this is where I ALWAYS have to return.    My favorites:  First, the cheese crisp. IT'S MANDATORY.  I get it plain.  I scoop an inappropriate amount of their house-made hot sauce (it's red, it's smooth, it's ha-cha-cha-spicy) onto a wedge of crispy cheese goodness, and I moan desperately as I eat it.    If you told me I could come to Macayo's but no cheese crisp, I would not go.  I would also sulk and pout and make life SUCK for you.. but no cheese crisp, NO DICE.  Second, also MANDATORY, is the little appetizer plate.  I load it with a handful of chips.  I carefully sprinkle an even amount of their salsa onto each chip.  Then I drizzle the smooth ha-cha-cha-hot sauce all over them.  Then lightly sprinkle some salt on them all, which somehow takes the heat up just that ONE LAST NOTCH.  Then, I gobble the whole plate (think, cookie monster on sesame street).  Down some of my adult beverage, and repeat.  Third, I always *think* I'll get something new.  I always *promise* that I'm going to order something different.   And then I get one or the other of the SAME TWO THINGS, and I have ordered those SAME TWO THINGS for an embarrassing twenty years.  Here they are (drumroll):  Option One:   The Baja Chimi.  Okay, look, there's just no way to describe it.  Juicy chicken wrapped up inside a massive tortilla.  DEEP FRY THAT.  Then some sauce made cleverly with heroin and various other addictive substances.  THEN, some melty cream cheese business over that.  THEN, some other cheese over that.  Yes... my precious... and then you drizzle that special hot sauce over the top... ugh, I wonder if I can talk my husband into taking me there on a weeknight.  I need a minute to recover here.  Option Two:  The Mex & Match.  It's your mexican-restaurant combo situation.  I have to anchor my Mex & Match with the non-negotiable piping-hot crunchy shredded beef taco stuffed with cold lettuce and cheese.  Then, I "mex" it up by either getting the cheese enchilada (it's the CHEESE... no, it's the SAUCE... no, it's the CHEESE... no, it's the SAUCE... WHO CAN EXPLAIN THE MYSTERIES OF DELICIOUSNESS???)  -or- I get the shredded beef tamale smothered in the red sauce... so dense and chewy and saucy and delicious... I'm going to cry.  They serve the Mex & Match with rice and beans for that complete "Put me in a wheelbarrow, I'm disgusted with myself, now I understand the meaning of binge-eating" sensation.  If you can discipline yourself enough to put some of your meal into a box to take home BEFORE you rupture something, I can highly recommend the Enchiladas Dulces... it's, like... apple pie filling and cream cheese and ....wrapped up... there's some frying.... and then cinnamon sugar...? and then ice cream and chocolate sauce and caramel... *sniffle* ...yes, yes, I AM going to cry....

I'm so sad about it.  I've been attending Macayo's like devout Catholics attend mass, for my whole life. First in Phoenix, growing up on the west side, and then the Mesa location staring in 1994.   Today was my first 100% bad experience... The service (appalling- younger female server was apathetic and rude, we died of thirst) and the food (wrong the first time, angrily and unappetizingly plated the second time, and nothing resembling the way the dish has been prepared for decades) was just so bad this time.  I don't ever, and didn't this time, ask for free food or to talk to managers, but the manager stopped at the table anyway... Apparently to be defensive that they changed the dish (yes, i noticed- I'm not asking for anything, I just won't eat it!) and to snippishly inform me that the salad dressing is the same as always (no, it isn't, but I just want to pay and leave) so I'm not sure what that was about other than maybe he'd been told by the server that we were unhappy and he seemed to have assumptions that we wanted something -which we didn't.   I felt like a stranger in a strange land... It's so far to drive that we probably won't anymore. Two stars for nostalgia alone. I'm devastated... macayo's is my One True Love... GUYS, what happened??

Okay, so we did go back after I swore off returning.   We had an eye appointment with the awesome eye doctor there in the parking lot, and the siren song (of the olden days when Macayo's was my favorite restaurant) was calling me.  I focused on the chips and the hot sauce (which you must ask for or you'll never know the glory) and then ordered a tried and true favorite, and it was fine.  Things are a little different from back in the day.  That's a fact.  They won't acknowledge it, but it's true.  However, sticking with a reliable mex-n-match of shredded beef taco and a beef tamale, rice & beans, I did fine.  The service is marginal these days unless you get one of the "old" crew- there is a short full-figured blonde waitress that's been there forever, and she is the finest server you can have for any price-level restaurant.  I can't remember her name. But she's great.  Anyhow, it was better this time.

I've been so excited to try this place for the longest time.  It was everything I had hoped for and more.  Three words: Pneumatic. Condiment. Dispensers. Okay, folks, I'm a condiment lover.  I freaking love me some condiments on any day from anywhere.  Put out Ranch Dressing or BBQ Sauce in your condiment line-up and I'm even happier.  But put all the ketchup, mustard, mayo, ranch, AND bbq sauce in a shiny metal display and dispense it to me PNEUMATICALLY????? Freaking hell ...I'm distracted all the time now because I want to go back and order five different things that I can put condiments on just so I can use the pneumatic dispensers.   SO FUN!!!!! Oh, and the food.  Okay, I'll be honest, I expected good food.  I expected REALLY good food.  And I was overwhelmed at the sheer selection of food on the menu, and the flat-panel displays flashing clips of video, pictures of food, and offering me fresh ice cream shakes or fried green beans (which I didnt get but will next time).  Ordering (meaning I had to actually CHOOSE) was an exquisite agony.  I dithered for no less than 17 minutes, circling the dining room with my iPhone (to read what other Yelpers ate) and clutching the laminated menu to my chest like a crucifix.  Once my lunch partners had all arrived, my time was up and I had to enter the line.  I couldn't concentrate on the conversation because as we wound back and forth in the line, I was able to see what other people were eating, and what was being served up in the window (yes! you can watch them preparing the delicious food!) which caused me to change my mind several times. I'm the kind of person who HAS to order last, simply because I MUST KNOW what everyone else is having. It serves to lessen my post-food-arrival regret and that painful longing of "I should have ordered that...." The moment of truth came and I decided upon a wood-fired BBQ chicken pizza.  And in a gluttonous moment of ridonkulous insanity, blurted out 'FRENCH FRIES' fully knowing that no amount of hours on the treadmill watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes on DVD could ever redeem my choice of lunch.  But... DO NOT JUDGE ME!  You weren't there watching the orders of fries being shunted out to happy diners... it wasn't completely in my control. Food arrived.  I did admire my fellow luncher's selections, but did not suffer overmuch from longing or regret.  I had a giant wood-fired bbq chicken pizza with globs of melted fresh mozzarella on it... a paper basket of the most delicious french fries of my life... and (drumroll).... PNEUMATIC CONDIMENT DISPENSERS! It's no business of yours, to be sure, why I might have needed ketchup, mayo, mustard, ranch AND bbq sauce for my pizza and french fries.  But I just did.   To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.

I wrote this review in July on my cellphone, but I guess it's been sitting since then, waiting for me to post it.    The food here was passably good/okay.  Our general feeling was one of "rushed". It was shortly after ten am on a very hot July Saturday.    We've seen this place during the winters, and it's usually packed to the rafters with a full patio and a crowd waiting out front.  Today, it was comparatively light and we were seated immediately in a spacious booth. Like, seriously tons of room.  So nice.  I hate feeling cramped.    There were water glasses on the table, as well as coffee mugs.   But at no time during our stay did either of us receive any water.   I didn't notice, because I had ordered iced tea.  However, my handsome date ordered coffee, and then the biscuits and gravy.  He's not a complainer, so it wasn't until I asked him toward the end of our meal "How are the biscuits and gravy?" And he said they were very good, had a little spice to them, which he would have enjoyed more if he wasn't so thirsty.    Right then,  the bill was dropped on our table, and I realized that the bill had actually been folded up and dropped by the waitress BETWEEN our dry and empty, never-used water glasses.    As she walked away, he thoughtfully remarked, "You know...she was at our table 5 or 6 times asking what we wanted to order, but then someone else brought the food, and we didn't see her again until she dropped the bill."  He was right (and that's the most complaining I've *ever* heard him do).  He loves potatoes (LOVES... Like... Inappropriately loves, would eat for every meal, doesn't care if there's nothing all week for dinner but microwaved potatoes, ADORES) and he hadn't touched his breakfast potatoes.   I asked why... "They weren't done enough to eat, still crunchy," he said.  And that's when I knew that his meal had probably been as close to restaurant hell, for him, as any human should have to endure.  It's 109 today, he had hot coffee, spicy gravy on biscuits, no water, and his raison d'être (potatoes) were inedible.  I poked one and it was thoroughly hard. Upon visual inspection, still had the slightly shiny translucence of raw potato, vs the white "fluffy" look of cooked potato.   My only complaint, personally, (until I saw how much he had endured with the patience of Job), was bacon that was floppy vs crisp.  But bacon is like sex... Even when it's not the best, it's still BACON.  I had eggs and pancakes, both pretty good, neither outstanding or in any way noticeable as very good or very bad.  I am not sure the butter was butter, might have been a margarine of some sort.  It never melted into the pancakes as butter does.   That said (I know it's a lot), I think that if our waitress (Cindy/Cyndi/Cindi ..sp?) had been even marginally present after the food was ordered... Like spread out those 5-6 "Have you decided yet? Have you decided yet? Have you decided yet?," which started as we were seated an then came about every 75 seconds... and felt slightly harrassing... maybe just spread those visits over the course of our stay, that might have resulted in us having water, or me receiving at least one top-off of my single (plastic) cup of iced tea. It my husband having a chance to ask if someone could please cook his potatoes?   It would have been expected and totally normal, for service and food to be rushed... If they'd been packed.  But they weren't.  There were plenty of empty tables, nary a soul on the patio, and no one waiting to be seated.    I can see potential and some of the food was good... Servers get to have an "off" day too, we may try again some other time.

Usually I'm pretty easy to please.  And it's easy to make one or two mistakes. However, three of us went tonight and it was awful.  We had difficulty all night getting any service.  My order was done incorrectly (just wanted no onions on a burger) -twice- before it came a third time, obviously mangled and man-handled with all of the toppings scraped off (I wanted the rest of the toppings, just not the onions).   I gave up and just ate the fries... which were cold. Our drinks were always empty, we spoke with the manager, who moved us to different tables (?) and the service did not improve, so after about an hour of this, we literally got frustrated and called it a night.  ....and I left so thirsty that I had to stop at a c-store, and buy a bottle of water for the drive home.

My first question when I walked into Baci was, "How long have you been here?" The answer? EIGHT YEARS!! I was just stunned.  I am so sad I never knew they were here before now. I'm so happy to know about them, now!  Our family had gone to celebrate Mother's Day and my mom's birthday, courtesy of my brother.  What a treat!  It's nicely painted and holds a goodly number of people. There is a lovely water feature in the middle of the front dining room.  There are tv's for people to watch, and an assortment of booths and tables.  You can definitely bring a group or your family.  Warm fresh bread, crusty on the outside and soft inside, was served generously; there is butter, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil for the bread.  You do not need to order appetizers, but they're tasty.  Appetizer portions are small-ish but are priced low (about $7) so that you can order more than one and have a nice variety to share. We ordered the fried antipasti with three selections: zucchini, mushrooms, and cheese sticks. It came with huge portions of marinara and ranch to share.  Then the salad or soup (you choose) was served.  Salad was a nice, generous portion of mixed greens with a few crisp croutons and dressing.  I enjoyed the bleu cheese dressing with my salad.  By this time, I was feeling fairly surfeit.  And then the food came out.  These portions are easily enough for two people (and I like to EAT).   Dinners are, on average, about $13-$16. Of course it's more of you're having veal, less of its just pasta and sauce.  I had the chicken broccoli Alfredo. Huge. I got through about 1/3 of it.  Husband had lasagna and he managed half, but he feels sorry for himself now.  My sister and brother had the Pasta ala Baci; sister asked for it spicy, brother asked for extra sausage.  Mom had fettuccini Alfredo with brocolli.  Sister's 3-yr old grandchild had a child's portion of pasta with one meatball and sauce on the side (child's portion was still would have been more than I could have eaten).  Sister in Law had Tortellini Paisano in a vodka sauce that looked great.  Everyone was making "those noises" as they ate. So delicious.  The pasta is clearly handmade; if you've ever made your own pasta, you can absolutely tell. Firm but tender al dente, no mush. The Alfredo sauce was thick and creamy and there was plenty of it (I hate it when restaurants are chintzy with sauce!), the chicken tender and juicy, the broccoli perfectly tender-crisp.   Husband pointed out that if you don't like your food, it's your fault, because they'll literally do it any way you want. He's right.  However, after all of that, my favorite part about the restaurant was the pride evident in the staff. They like what they do. They're rightfully proud of what they're doing there.  It was a pleasure to experience. I can't wait to go back!  Next time, I'll skip eating appetizers and some of the bread, and get dessert!

We loved this place!!!  We meaning my "man's man" UFC loving husband, my 17year old iPhone-toting intelligent daughter, my overly-sensitive robot loving 6-year old son.. And me...I can be summed up by my shoes: 6-inch platform Maddens.   The point is, we are a diverse group.  And when we go out, there's usually only ONE of us that's happy with the venue.  Rarely do we all seriously dig a place.  We seriously dig this place.  It was 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon and my #1 sexy husband man was craving MEAT.  Newly moved into the neighborhood, of course I turned to my Yelpers for help.  I noticed that, in the few reviews, the manly men like the place.  The E.V. barbies don't. But when a Master Yelper gives five stars... I go.  We went.  Appetizers were spinach artichoke dip and the potato skins.  I won't eat potato skins anymore because I despise the sensation of gnawing on an old boot. My man made me try it and I was delighted to note that the edges were crisp, the rest was tender, and filled with cheesy, bacony goodness. The spinach artichoke dip was LEGIT.  Actual spinach and artichoke, NOT swimming in goo, but nicely blended and seasoned, and served with warm, soft pita  triangles. Yum.  Hubby had the 16-ounce Ribeye with mashed potatoes. He loved it: he ate it all.  Usually, he will order a price of meat, eat a few bites, and declare it substandard (compared to the 5-star restaurants he prefers in Vegas).  My daughter had the NY Strip, done medium (our adorable server talked her out of ordering it well done) with wild rice. She actually put her iPhone down to eat it, and shared bites of wild rice with everyone.  I ordered the filet, medium, with sautéed mushrooms on top... So tender... Seriously cannot get a filet like this without dropping three Benji's in Snottsdale.  To have it within ten minutes of Seville? Heaven.   The boy had "caribou nuggets" (just the chicken nugget meal) and fries, which he drowned in salt and quite enjoyed.   For the great food we had, the bill was appropriate, and our server was a darling, sweet girl who kept the Pomegranate Green Teas coming for my daughter and I, and the cocktails coming for my husband.   It's a lovely change from the chain steak places, the service was attentive but not intrusive, and we spent the whole time amazed by the collection of trophies the owner has spent a lifetime to assemble.  Although i could never bring myself to hunt, but I can appreciate the effort that went into this collection, and the sheer artistry of the display.

First time visit- many props for a very clean and clutter-free restaurant. The menu seemed really quite extensive, but I had in mind exactly what I wanted to try: the Sandwich Cubano.  I ordered mine with mariquitas.  My friend ordered the Cubano with the Yuca Frita- it was my first time trying ANY of these things...  I liked the yuca better than the mariquitas... nothing wrong with them (and it isn't like I would know if there was or wasn't as I've never had Cuban food before!), just my personal preference for next time. My friend, however, has not only a wealth of experience with Cuban cuisine, but has been to this particular restaurant before.  She was a fountain of knowledge, and I was glad for her guidance.  She ordered a little side dish of "mojo" which was $0.75, so definitely cheap enough and she recommended it highly.  It is some sort of oil with chunky, sauteed onion/garlic in it, served warm.  I dipped my sandwich and mariquitas in it sparingly, and it was very savory.  I now need a breath mint like nobody's business. I ordered a drink called Jupina, which is a carbonated pineapple beverage.  It was served in a can with a glass of ice, and it was very enjoyable. I have zero complaints about the food or service, which was deferential and polite, but I will say that trying to squeeze it into our lunch hour was challenging, and neither of us made it back to work on time.  Certainly the freshly-prepared food was worth the wait, but anyone going for lunch should know that it's not the fastest place - but if you want fast you go to Jimmy John's, eh? Next time I will just let our server know we are on a time crunch and I am betting, based on how nice they were, that they'll be able to help us out!  We are planning on a return visit in two weeks, and I'd definitely give a 5-star review if we can get in and out in under 1 hr and 15 mins.

We order Hong Kong Kitchen for pickup 1-2 times per month, and we have for about a year and a half.  It's consistently delicious, hot, and between the call and being ready takes an absolutely consistent, and incredibly speedy, ten minutes.   We have ordered take-out from this restaurant approximately 20-25 times and we've never had to wait.   Our faves:  Teriyaki chicken Sweet & sour chicken (or pork) ALL of the lo mein dishes Egg rolls are to. die. for. Fried rice -yum.

I dropped by with something flapping and dangling underneath my car.  Some sort of a hard plastic strap.  They were very sweet.  They pulled it right in (even though they were busy) and fixed it.    Not five minutes went past when a young man brought my car up to the front door.  I went up to the cashier... Nervous about the possible charges.    Free!  What a kindness!  I'm m sure that they could have charged me something, but they were very kind

I love snap because i was SO sick of meat-market gyms with zero workout help unless you want to be subjected to the high pressure sales tactics of Big Chain "trainers".  Snap has everything I need, nothing I don't need, and something I may consider (tanning).  It's small and personal, and open 24 hours- absolutely necessary for out family.  Jeremiah is my personal trainer and I used to think i was working out... I NEVER had a work out until I had one with him.  Now I train with him once a week.

I used Bishop and Son a year and a half ago and he (Rick) was wonderful then.  He educated me about my washing machine, fixed it for a VERY reasonable amount, and assured me I'd get much more use out of it. It's worked like a new machine since then.   I needed him again when my dryer died last weekend. He came out with everything in hand that it could possibly need.  I learned more about my dryer than I've ever known, and he assured me of only other thing that could ever wear out, and told me how much that would be if i ever need to replace it someday, before he asked me if I wanted to fix what is wrong with it now.   As he worked, we talked about new units and what replacement parts cost for them (LG has reasonable parts costs, Kenmore and Whirlpool front loaders charge 6-7 times more for the parts than LG-  GOOD TO KNOW) and then he cleaned out built up lint in my machine that is a possible fire hazard.   I appreciate him so much, and I'm a customer for life.

I had eaten here a couple years ago, and unlike other Yelpers, once I have a really bad dining experience, I don't go back. At the time, I wasn't a yelper.  But now I am, and my recent experience with Geno's led me to do a review.  The pizza we had there was really bad. And I honestly believe pizza is like sex... Even if you're having bad pizza, hey, you're still HAVING PIZZA.  But this was the kind of pizza that made me wish I was a pizza-abstainer. 'Nuf said.  Recent experience was at a stoplight- no, wait, stay with me here.  Heading south on higley, just past the train tracks, not quite to williams field stoplight... Its a one lane road and traffic was backed up to kingdom come.   I drive a nice sports car with a manual transmission.  A very persnickety clutch, may I add.  And recently have had some health problems that affect my ankles.  I accidentally, embarrassingly, and with a red face, stalled my car, started it up and drove on the whole 3 feet that opened up. Its not like we were going anywhere because of the traffic backed up from the light all the way past the train tracks, anyway.  The Geno's delivery driver behind me proceeded to honk at and harass me all the way to Pecos, where he pulled up next to me to flip me the bird I posted up in the pictures of this business's profile.   He then pulled back into Geno's, and I drove on, with my photo and a warm fuzzy in my heart that I could share my experiences with you smart and good looking Yelpers.   MUAH!

When I asked the age old question of "Where are we going for lunch", today, my coworker said she noticed a new place that had opened up the road.  We had no idea what type of food, just that it was new.  When we drove up, we were pleased to see that they were open and it was a charmingly decorated and homey little place.   We were greeted nicely and told to pick any seat.   They serve breakfast and lunch, and everything looked great.  My coworker chose the BBQ Chicken Salad, and I chose the Mushroom Swiss Burger.  We were very, very pleased with the food, which was delicious.  Service was very friendly.  Prices were totally reasonable.  My giant burger (large, rectangle, freshly made ground beef smothered in swiss and mushrooms, on what tasted like a freshly homemade and butter-toasted bun, with a side salad, a Diet Dr Pepper (and another one put into a to-go cup when we were ready to leave) came to $12.    My coworker and I were lusting each other's lunches (her Chicken Salad was ENORMOUS and mounded with fresh BBQ chicken and long tortilla strips), so we will probably go back next week and order what the other had today.

Went with a friend for brunch.  The food was inventive and delicious!  Many ingredients are locally sourced and nothing was just "run of the mill". It seems like everything has a special touch or detail. We ate so much and were beyond stuffed. Service was lovely and prompt, server was engaged and friendly. We would love to go back!

I'd had lash extensions for nearly three years before I was ardently encouraged by a friend of mine to switch away from my unlicensed-doing-it-in-her-home lash lady and come see Kendra, who IS licensed.   "What difference could that make?" I wondered.  Switching seemed ...mean... and seemed like a hassle, and I fought it for a few months.  But after looking into the differences between having a licensed aesthetician performing my lash extensions vs. someone who was trained by someone who was trained by someone who may or may not have ever been licensed... was like me going up to a stranger on the street and asking them for a root canal.  I switched.  And I've never been so glad I did.  The first thing Kendra did when I arrived, was take a good long look at what extensions I had, existing.  She was quiet for a minute and then let me know that she was really sorry but she'd have to soak them off and start over.  I was apprehensive about that, but her explanation was so factual and science-based that I trusted what she was saying- which was that I had clumps and clusters of glue and lashes stuck to skin and other lashes, and that clusters are actually illegal - and I know for a fact that some of my friends go and get "clusters" on purpose (eek!) because they're hard on your natural lashes.  Kendra explained that my lashes were damaged, thinned, and very, very short.  After she soaked them off, I asked if I could see a mirror, because I hadn't been without lash extensions in years, and wanted to SEE what I had left. I had nothing.  There were bald patches that had been hidden by blobs of glue and big fat clusters... and what I had left was excruciatingly short.  Think of how thick two credit cards are, stacked.  That's all I had left.   I wish I had not looked.  If you've been seeing someone unlicensed or unskilled- just take my word for it.  DON'T LOOK.  After she put lashes back on me -lighter in weight and thickness- carefully, lash by lash, no clumps of glue, no clusters of big, thick, lashes-  it looked completely different from what I'd had before.  But it was CORRECT, and right, and healthy.   And the shocking thing to me (not that it's the most important thing when we are talking about your EYES) was that I was now paying Kendra LESS than I'd been paying an unlicensed woman who'd been working out of her home without a license, y'all.     Kendra has a legitimate salon space in San Tan mall, a license, and now that I've been seeing her for nearly a year, I've come to learn that she invests a ton in her products and continuing education.  She's great at what she does, is totally invested in her skill-sets (she does more than just lashes), and I love her dry and sarchastic wit.  I wish I'd had my you-know-what as perfectly "together", back when I was her age

This was our first time grooming our puppy, Toot.  He's just a little over 1 year, and, well... He's sort of high spirited.  At the vet's office after he was neutered, they said, "he wasn't TECHNICALLY the worst dog they'd ever had there"...so that gives you a frame of reference for his behavior.   We aren't sure what he is... A dorky? A porkie? A terror-weenie is actually our best guess.  Errr, I mean terrier-weenie.    Jennifer was very welcoming when we called yesterday to inquire about grooming services, and she was Toot's groomer today.  She couldn't have been nicer, and she did a fantastic job with his haircut.   Since we don't know what he is, she had to wing it on the style, and we decided to just go with whatever she suggested.  He turned out adorably clean & clipped.   For $40, he was washed and brushed and got a full-body haircut, got his nails done, his ears cleaned, his teeth brushed with enzymatic gel, and topped off with a manly-looking boy-doggie bandana.  I think that was all, but the services were so comprehensive that I may have missed something.    As it was Toot's first time ever, she also save a clipping of his hair and taped it to a little "Puppy's First Haircut" card.  She explained their stamp-card program and how referrals and return visits add up to $20 off of a future service.  She was kind to Toot and you could tell he liked her, even though she was using loud thugs like blow dryers and nail drills and clippers and such.  She pre-booked us for our next visit and explained how maintenance would work for us ($25 every 4 weeks).  (the best part is that we got a three hour break from our terror-weenie)  Pretty awesome!

I hate to dogpile another low rating here, but it's really bad. This location is a desperate cry for help. I've tried this place at least 6-8 times. I really WANT them to be here, I WANT them to succeed.  Assuming there's an actual owner to this franchise (where are you? Why don't you care?) or maybe if it's just one in a billion corporate locations, (district manager? Anyone?) -this place is one, giant example of "don't".    I've had employees be rude and shirty. Trained and snippy, or untrained & incompetently simple-minded. But the worst are the ones that are both untrained AND rude.   I've had long waits, been overcharged (even with another employee standing beside the cashier saying "You're overcharging her.") had our food prepared incorrectly.  I stopped going inside because the drive thru reviews are moderately better.  I needed a couple of 25-packs of munchkins, two separate times, for church youth activities.  Both times, the product was stale. Like... Ping pong ball stale.  I don't know. I hear there's another donut place Opening up around the way- I don't think I'll have the heart to try DD again.

It was 11 on a Friday; no wait.  I was seated right away even though I was still waiting for a friend- so maybe the complaints about not being seated until the whole party arrived has to do with really busy times! Fun, energetic servers... The food was delicious!  My friend had a Benedict duo and I had a breakfast burrito.  It really was a great time.

We live in Seville, and have been going to the Blue32 up on Val Vista and Williams Field.  We waited anxiously for this to open, and all of the anticipation led to some really high expectations.    I'm happy to report that our expectations have been exceeded twice in a row.   Last time, we were seated at a table with a server named Amanda and we loved her.  The food was great (I had the Alfredo pasta, very flavorful) but my favorite every time is the strawberry daiquiri.  They're made with real strawberries rather than gloppy corn syrup mix, and the taste is miles apart.    We couldn't remember our awesome servers name this trip (sorry Amanda) but we won't forget because we've now immortalized her in this review.    She's thoughtful.  We had been dithering about what to order (flatbread? Shrimp poboy? Steak?) When a massive party arrived, requiring extra tables and chairs to be brought in, she was nice enough let us know so we could get our order in before they were all seated.    We never wanted for a drink or water refill, food was correct and piping hot, and she's just delightful.    Also... Fresh Strawberry daiquiris... Did I mention that..???

Fun little place! I love local food places. This one plays great music and there was a happy guy singing along as he worked behind the counter. I love seeing people happy at work, and they always make a better product. The vibe is fun & light.  The food came quickly, and I enjoy watching food being made. My son (not a big eater) scarfed his Jr. Mugsy Dog and his fries (kids meal) and asked for another dog. I ordered one more for him at the counter and before I could sit down, a nice young lady handed his 2nd hot dog to him.  I ordered a Polish and a side of fries. I was pleased with the size of the fries, and they were my favorite- crispy on the outside, fluffy in the middle, and HOT!   They come with a cup of fry sauce (mmmm!) and I went and got a second one because it was tasty and there were that many fries.   Love this place!
