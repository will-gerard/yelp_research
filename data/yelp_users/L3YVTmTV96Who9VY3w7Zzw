free wi fi! thank god since i was stuck here for like 8 hours last night. stupid set up in terms of where the rental cars are in comparison to the actual airport. People are friendly who work there(which they pride themselves on) .Southwest you need to step up your A-game tho with them constant delays but thats a separate Yelp

I have stayed here twice, and can't say enough good about the ambience and quality of the hotel. Staff rules, it doesn't smell like a gross smokey casino, great food . I like you Mandalay , you are awesome

I get it, you chicks are badasses that keep bar and you are going to scream at everyone ...because you are badass chicks . And screaming profanities on a megaphone is like the way to prove you mean business. Let's see if you'd talk that shit if you weren't flanked by bouncers who could probably eat a large hotel . I was looking forward to a dive bar in vegas since everything else is so goddamn expensive, and I come from the land of the dive. All this place did for me was give me a headache

decent field. I do like how my Field Box made me feel like I was basically in the dugout(unfortunately the A's dugout). Crazy open sun during the daytime ,thank god it wasn't super humid . I did partake in some foot long hot dog eating , but unlike the review before me , I thought it tasted like barf. Good parking across the street and at a decent price

This by far is the most fun pool scene in Vegas. The only star off is for the ridiculous price of drinks(10 bucks for a Tecate? Where I live you pay like 2-3 bucks for a Tecate) . I went to Ditch Friday with DJ Jazzy Jeff and had the best day I didn't want to leave. We luckily snagged free chairs and had our stuff guarded by the amazing bodyguardbouncer dude Paulo who we all wanted to adopt as a friend. Everyone is hot, the music was great, the area is so big so you never get cramped , and I love the mist as you wait for drinks. One other neg...those bathrooms are disgusting. get it together . Other than that super dooper fun and when I'm ready to go back to vegas in another like five years I'm coming back here!
