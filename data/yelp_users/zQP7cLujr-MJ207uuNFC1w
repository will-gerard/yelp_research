This is a fantastic company.  They have a very high rating with BBB and have won a ton of customer service awards.  Hopefully you dont need them but if you have an emergency in your home or business call them.

This is the best Sushi ever.  We eat here at least once a week and love it.  The fish portions are large and the price is reasonable.  I send people there all the time and they love it.  The staff is great and the sushi bar is usually very fun.    Must try: The "House" Smoked Salmon.  It is amazing.  Make sure it is not the regular smoked salmon.  The Pink Panda roll is amazing too.  It is not on the menu but the sushi guys know what it is.

I know this place is new so I will give them another chance but I have been twice and had not great service.  The first time we went for dinner and received our meals before our starters and the waiter did not even realize we never received them.  He did take one off the bill which was nice.  They then charged by boyfriends card double which took about a week to get the charges reversed.    My second visit was for lunch with a group of girlfriends and the experience was worse.  We all received our food at different times and the lost my order and one other girls order.  They did not even serve our soups at the same time, when we asked why they waitress said they were washing more bowl.  We found this very odd being that it was a weekday lunch with about 10 people in the entire place.    The food was good.  The tuna lunch bowl was really good.  Be careful if you don't like spicy because the food is spicy.  For me thats a good thing.  I love close and I am excited about the place so I hope they get the kinks worked out.  The dumplings were Yum!   Happy Eating!
