I'd eaten here before, and remembered the pizza being crispy, and service being quick even though the place was full. Not today, my friends, not today. Sloooooooowwwww service, and not too helpful. Pizza was good once it got to us... but by then we probably would've eaten cardboard with artichokes ans spinach and not noticed. I don't think I'll be back any time soon.

I'm a big fan of exotic cuisines, and this place has got a great selection of foods to help you creat your own middle eastern inspired feast. Plus they have the most amazing gelato! Made from REAL fruit. They work with international vendors to bring in the freshest ingredients for their gelato. I am a huge fan of the mango with strawberries!   The store is hidden by Amazing Jakes and the Discount Card and Party store, but well worth the hunt! The owner is very knowledgable and nice. They only accept cash, but that is to help keep their prices low. And let me tell you - they are very, very affordable. You can get the same ingredients, in larger quantities, for less than you would pay at AJs or Trader Joes.
