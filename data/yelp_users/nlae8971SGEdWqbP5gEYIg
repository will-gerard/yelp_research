Unreal German food in a decent environment with excellent service! I also love the plethora of German beer. It is sooooo good! I had the Rindsrouladen... Braised Beef Rouladen stuffed with bacon, onions and pickle. It was delicous in every way.The side items were Sp√§tzle and red cabbage... also excellent. A pleasant surprise was the house salad. Ridiculously good. Fresh mixed greens. Perfect amount of dressing. and underneath in four little piles were surprises of carrot, pasta, cabbage, and another Item I have forgotten. All delicious little piles. Like gifts! Oh, and I almost forgot the BREAD! Good God! The pretzel rolls with a little butter are otherworldly. I want to come back here so bad ... but living in KC it is going to be a while.

I'm not a fan but I enjoy drinking at the bar area. So if you're coming to drink ... not so bad. If you're coming to eat ...  ah you might think again!

A true dive on the end of an access road and also on the end of an old motor lodge. While the lodge may be dead, This little joint is alive! I had under an hour to get to the airport and had the choripollo dinner. Delicious breast topped with chrorizo and cheese. Coronas are ice cold. Service is team oriented.  My kinda place!

Tasty treats and sandwiches. Friendly service. WiFi. Good wines at a fair price. What more do you want?!  The place is BUSY though, so here's to hoping they can hold it all together, or open another location for you lucky folks in Phoenix.

I was not a fan.  They used an anaheim chili in the relleno... BIG mistake. It is poblano or nothing, people!  I also tried a green corn/green chili tamale. Too sweet. Not enough green chili. Just meh.  They did have a good habanero based salsa by request... unfortunately, like most Mexican joints these days, the chips you used to dip in the salsa sucked by all measures.  Another Mex restaurant disappointment. A pattern has definitely developed.

You know, every culture has some delicious form of fried bread. From donuts to funnel cakes to begniets to fried dough to sopapillas and on and on.  They are all good. Deep fried, melt-in-your-mouth, good.  Indian Fry bread is no exception. It may have the advantage of being easier to make at home than other fried doughs... so I am a big fan.  Here I had the vegetarian and it was filled with a tasty mess of green chiles and beans and other mostly healthy things.   Then I had the eyes-roll-back-in-your-head honey and sugar combo. Hot and tasty honey. Beautiful bread and powdered sugar. Just a pleasure to eat.  The staff here was very nice, too.

TASTY spicy pork taco plate. Chili Relleno was a little disappointing... too small of a chili inside the egg batter. The sauce was killer, though.  The chips were a little greasy.  The details were all very good, though. The salsas, the rice, the beans... all very well done.  I also had a little taste of their poblano mole... oh yeah... it's good!  The main thing here is probably to order the right thing... the menu is extensive and not all of it is perfect.

If you want REAL Neapolitan pizza baked in a REAL 800F+ oven to perfection... eat here. If you want a bready mess of a "pizza" go somewhere else.  We had the cinque formaggio pizza and it was divine. One of the best pizzas I have ever eaten.  If you want a great selection of wines by the glass, this is also a nice place.  The service was very casual and nice as well.

Really nice produce and specialty items entice you to spend your nest egg here and blow you college savings fund before Johnny is eligible to attend the state school. This place is like Whole Foods, with a emphasis on local specialty items and some global foods. I saw some nice sakes, beers, and liquors from afar on the shelf. You could put together a gourmet meal here, no problem. Just bring your wallet and don't tell Johnny he is going to have to  work through college.  : )

We had a large group dinner here for work. The staff was super nice and very attentive. We had a set menu/price arrangement to make it easier to serve our group. The selections were not disappointing.  The shrimp and crab cake appetizer were excellent. The shrimp has a spicy punch and the vegetables underneath were untouched... I grabbed them and they were awesome! Crab cakes were meaty and flavorful.   I had a petite fillet, which was cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly. It was a great steak. The brined and roasted chicken was also tasty, but you have to like the saltiness of a brined meat. I recommend a bland side item to take up some of the salt.  The sides of sugar snap peas and loaded mashers were both very good.  Finally, the creme brulee was for REAL. Real vanilla beans, perfect caramel sugar crust, perfect texture and taste of the custard. Really good eats.   They also had a decent wine list... never a bad thing!

Looks like there are some haters out there!  This place - in no way - deserves less than three stars in any opinion. It is at least A-OK folks. You may have a bad experience individually, but the negative review I read were just a little snobby.  Beautiful place. Great focaccia and pesto... but go easy, Killer, or you will spoil dinner.  Tasty flat bread pizza... The asparagus/shroom combo was fine, but you must like a pronounced shroom flavor.  The Mediterranean salad was a nice balance of color, flavor, and texture.

I has a plate of  braised beef tongue slices, yucca, rice, beans, and plantains. It was more than enough food and everything was delicious. If this is your first time eating beef tongue, I'd pass and try it on a mexican street taco first. The larger slices and stronger beef flavor may be a bit off-putting to first time eaters here.Tongue is the essence of beef... you must try it at some point. :-) The service and staff were superb.

A nice alternative to Panera in my area, I really enjoyed to quick service and good little salad and sandwich here. The cookie they give you with combos is what pushes it from 3 to 4 stars!  : )

SPP is in the Baxter Town development. It's a tidy little everything-is-here community and SPP follows suit.  I had a local brew, which was nice to have available. Chicken wings were plump with an excellent buffalo/bbq combo sauce. I could have used a couple of extra minutes in the deep fry for mine, but they were good. The entree for me was a Flaming Blue burger and a side of collards. The collards were a highlight and the burger had several flavors going on... very tasty. It was cooked correctly (medium for me) as well. Service was almost too good... very attentive.

Wings! I am addicted.  Here they have a sauce selection that would embarrass many so-called wing establishments. I opted for the sauce-dip all-in-one... the hot ranch. So good. Just creamy and spicy and delicious. Wings are cooked long enough here to render out some fat and crisp up. Nice direct service as well. Got me in and out for lunch like a champ.

Excellent Pho with a good portion of beef and tendon. I love Pho with tendon and if that is your cup of tea... this place will not disappoint! There were also plenty of slices of jalapeno to put in the bowl... which I love. The broth did not require any sriracha or hoisin, and that is saying something! Service was excellent.

Frites, purple sweet potato gratin, green curry mussels, pork belly steamed bun. Yes, I had a feast and it was soooo worth it. :-) The gratin in particular was incredible.  I had excellent service alone at the bar and some fellow foodies to talk to. Excellent local beers are offered and there is a decent wine by the glass selection.

Pork belly tacos, sashimi tacos, lamb lollipops, salmonopita, bone marrow, Korean wings, fried Brussels sprouts, and more. I was there with colleagues and we shared a feast of small plates. All of them were so good. We also had excellent service. This is a gem amongst many good places in Uptown.

I bought a large assortment of donuts for colleagues here. My favorite was the sour cream cake. They have many varieties and always offer up free holes with larger purchases. You gotta love bonuses!

Hideous noise levels inside, but great burgers and good service. The Jalapeno Popper Show Stopper was a big hit for me. I enjoyed every element of it, from the brioche bun to the perfectly cooked (medium) beef. Even the fried jalapeno"bottle caps" were obviously fresh made. Hard to go wrong with the food here.

Fish tacos and local beers were my pleasure to consume at this corner of Brevard Court. Who doesn't like a dead end street with some eating and drinking options? :-) We had a great server who kept our meal moving along after a long meeting week.

I had a "Build your own burger" and opted for my tried and true combo of grilled onion (sweet), grilled jalapeno (spicy), mayo (salty,fat), and cheese. It was prepared perfect medium and delicious. So, good food is possible at airports! Service from the dude at the bar was super.

The breakfast quiche and the croissants are really quite fine here. The chocolate and almond croissant is off the hook! This place takes "airport food" and makes the the "airport" part go away. Good food and friendly service.
