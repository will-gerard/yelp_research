Centrally located. Not a large shop. Friendly and helpful staff. They also have the knowledge of the items they are selling. That is always a plus! Definitely will bring the bike back for maintenance.

I'm giving this experience a 2 star rating, as I can't do 1.5. I brought my son and his friend here for a bite to eat before the movies. We were seated rather quickly which was a plus. Our server seemed less than happy to have a job. We ordered two Bourbon Street Steaks and a Grilled Chicken Salad. Albeit this is a chain restaurant, one would think the orders could have been gotten correctly. I ordered my steak medium rare, it came out well done. My son ordered his rare, it came out medium well. As for sautéed onions and mushrooms, well let's just say if burnt is the new sautéed then I don't like it. Needless to say, I will not come back. For the price it could have been better.

Nice store. Great selection. Helpful floor associate. The lady at the cash register appeared not to like her job.  Pretty much everything I need I can find at Home Depot.  They can be pricey on some items, which means one must always bargin hunt.

I have always enjoyed going to Ihop. Something about pancakes taste better when not made at home. The food is always seasoned to taste. I seldom find reason to add salt or pepper. The portions are nice size and I usually don't eat the entire meal.  The meal was prepared as ordered.  I must say the staff at this Ihop verses the one back home were much more friendlier. The service was great. They didn't let our drinks get empty before they brought more. They frequently checked with us to make sure all was well. The place is clean and well organized. Plus it was cool and pleasant to sit and enjoy my meal. I definitely will return to this Ihop in the future.

Surprised by how dirty the place is today. The floor looks a mess, the trash needs changed out. It isn't like the same place I come to when the owner is here. So can't wait to get my washer and dryer for the house.

So, I was introduced to Skechers by a very dear friend of mine. He bought me a pair, which I must say were and still are very comfortable. I have worn them daily to work. Being the type of person that gets hooked on a particular brand of shoes, stepping into these was a huge feat. Being a nurse comfort is my first idea when purchasing shoes. Not only for my feet but my back as well.   I purchased a second pair of Skechers recently at one of the outlet stores. These particular shoes were suppose to be better than the last pair and made to target the pressure points in ones foot. Yeah right!  While in LV I came upon the Skechers store on the strip, right across from the Wynn. I took myself and my sore little feet into this store. I spoke with the associate in regards to purchasing a better pair of shoes. She inquired as to why I did not like the pair I had on, an I discussed my concerns with her. In the end I did purchase another pair of shoes. The same style as the ones the love of my life had gifted to me. Who would have known a man could know just what would make my feet feel good?  Ha ha never doubt those that know you best.   Will I return to this particular store?  Perhaps in the future I might. Will I purchase another pair of shoes from an outlet, I really can't say. What I do know is I am in awe with the way my feet feel on a daily basis. I have also come to see that these shoes have lasted longer than the other brand I usually purchase. I will be investing in Skechers again. The prices are reasonable, the quality is great as far as I am concerned. Perhaps my discount Skechers were just of low quality.  Tis why they were on the cheap side?!?   As for those discounted Skechers I left them at the store in LV. The associated stated they would make a welcome gift for a homeless person.

I recently had the opportunity of experiencing Las Vegas. We drove from Surprise to LV, after picking up the family from the airport.   Do to miscommunications and such, we did not have a hotel booked upon our arrival. We arrived in the early morning hours and were tired from the drive. We decided to stay at the Main Street Station.  Parking was free, which was nice. It was also close to the entrance. Upon entering I noticed right off the old time feel by the decor in the lobby. I was impressed by the cleanliness and the friendliness of the staff. The cost of the room for three guests was impressive, less than 60 bucks. We had to be escorted to our room by security due to the key lock mechanism was broken. The elevators were designed to be old style and quite charming.   Our room overlooked downtown, and the place was quite a bit aways from the strip, nice I must say as far as being quiet. The room itself was clean and had two double beds. I myself did my normal sweep of the mattresses looking for the ever dreaded bugs of the night, and found none. We were on the 15th floor so the view was very nice.   The room itself was set up with a tv, re fridge, microwave and hair dryer. For my guests the downside was there was no complimentary coffee maker. Myself not really being a coffee drinker I was not alarmed by this fact. The bathroom was clean, water pressure so so. My only gripe with the bath is there were only enough linens for one person. Oh yes, and the fact if you were not 4 foot tall or shorter you had to stoop to shower.  My favorite decor within the room was the huge mirror on the wall.   Would I stay here again, perhaps, simply depends on the mood. Over all it was a nice experience. We did eat at the buffet upon checking out in the AM. This of which I was not impressed with at all. Being it was a large buffet one would assume that there would be a large selection of varieties of foods. This was not the case at all. Price was fair for the selection they I offered I suppose.   Overall two star rating based on my experiences at other hotels.

I was actually disappointed in my recent experience at Barnes & Noble.  I recently went into this particular store in search of a certain book trilogy that has been hyped up in the media. Anyhow, I entered here and was not greeted as I am use to back in Iowa. I roamed around looking for what I was after for a bit of time, as the associate at the service counter appeared busy on the phone. Was it a business call or personal?!?  The associates I encountered seemed as if they were annoyed and didn't care for their jobs. The young man at the register also left a lot to be desired. It were as if he were a robot.   I'll give the place another chance in the future, due to the proximity to home. However, I won't expect good customer service. A firm two stars simply because of location.

For me being outside is one of the greatest gifts. I don't need to shop, eat, and drink to be content. I don't need to spend a lot of money. Nature in an of itself is wonderful.   I've watched the sunset from my backyard over these mountains time after time. Today I took my son with me so we could walk and talk.  I needed to get away. He needed to hear me without interruption.   From the backyard the mountains look as if they are miles and miles away. In all actuality it's a short simple 10 mile drive. The cost to spend the day roaming around in nature, a simple $6 plus the cost of two Gatorade's.   We decided to walk the waterfall trail. A nice leisurely walk. Not to much of an incline. Simple for me.  We saw plenty of 'pine trees' dotting the landscape. I was able to take in the magnitude of the mountain as we walked. Everything is so much bigger once you get to it.   Although there wasn't water coming from the fall when we reached the end of the trail, it was still well worth the 2.5 mile walk (That being round trip) There was a pool of water at the base of the fall. This being Arizona an all, I wonder if the fall ever does have water?  Perhaps one day I will find out.   I do plan on returning to the park in the future. I so enjoy walking and taking in God's beauty. I would recommend this place to any an all who simply just want to get away from the stresses of life.

So I took my son and grandson to the Children's Museum of Phoenix for a Saturday outing.  Albeit it was a drive away from home, in the end it was worth all the smiles, laughs and fun that we had.  This was well worth the money paid to enter.  Upon entering I first noticed the wall of CDs, WOW.  Bright and beautiful for the eye.  My grandson immediately noticed the apparatus on the wall where he could put in a simple piece of fabric, it would be sucked through a maze of pipes then spit out.   Had I let him he would have spent his entire day playing in that one spot.  We had to coach him to play on the three level play area, once in there and experiencing all the fun to be had he did not want to come down and explore the rest of the museum.  Eventually we did. There was lots of interactive play areas to be explored, lots of learning to be had by all.  We venture up to the next floor being able to experience different aspects of arts, crafts and such.  We played music on plastic pipes by hitting them with a flip flop.  The little one rode his tricycle through the car wash and was able to maneuver the roadway.  We even went shopping in the fully set up store.  It was great to see the kids interact and mimic the adults they have been to stores with.  We recycled and we even had pretend lunch at the restaurant.  There is an actual cafe on the second floor.  They offer healthy food choices at a price.  There is also an area off of the café where you can sit and relax.  You're even allowed to bring along your own snacks to devour.    My grandson especially enjoyed the activities where he was able to do hands on.  He helped in painting the rocket ship.  LOL, oh so fun to watch little ones.  He drew pictures as well.  We also enjoyed the noodle room.  He and I were in and out hiding from one another.  This being on the third floor.  Here is where I found the soft sofa to sit upon and relax while my son and grandson went to enjoy the play area again.  At 11 dollars a head to get in who can resist?  The money goes back to the museum, all have fun while learning and it gives the little ones the opportunity to expend pent up energy.  The gift shop is a bit on the pricey side, but what gift shop isn't?  We did spend some money buying goodies not only for my grandson, but his little friend as well.    A good time was had by all.  The time, 4 hours, went by before we knew it.  Of note it is a clean and maintained place, considering all the little ones that are there on a daily basis.

He/she said the rain won't leave And the pain won't ease And the sun don't wanna shine And there's something in the bottom of this drink I just got And it don't look like a worm to me  I got a bug in my margarita Seems bad luck won't leave me alone I got a man/woman I'm tryin' to drink away And I got a long, long way to go Yeah, I got a long, long way to go  Lyrics from Alan Jackson's song 'Long Way To Go'  Just stopped in for a drink. Not much in the mood for anything or anyone. Woke up and stopped here on the way to the gas station. Nice staff. Clean establishment. OK for a person like me that simply wants one drink then to move along. Nothing bad to say.

So coming from Iowa I have never experienced the beauty of the sunset as I did at The Hole In the Rock. My sister an I went here back in October when she came for a visit. Yes, October, I have been slow to write a review. Being a person who enjoys nature and the beauties God has bestowed upon us I found a piece of calm of serenity here. Yea, Iowa has sunsets but not with the vibrant color as we seen. And not with such an open place to view them.   I didn't mind the walk up to the hole, nor the walk down. My thighs let me know of my feat, it was all a feel good pain!  Personally I could have, and would have been content to stay put and wait for the days to pass. To me being able to experience such calmness is tops.   I recently found myself at the Hole again. Why one would ask themselves?  Well sometimes in life a person needs to step back, regather, regroup and thank God for all they have in this life. Sometimes we get slapped with what we don't know is happening, only to be chastised and faulted. I took that time, words of hatred spoken and drove. I found myself watching a sunset and thanking God for the gifts given and the recent ability of understanding.  I understand that in life we are given time, sometimes we fail to be honest, we fail to share the whole picture. Sitting and watching the sunset brought a sense of fulfillment. I understand memories are to be made do to limited time. I, with the help of God, understood and still do. I haven't faulted, instead I have forgiven. I've learned a lot, the best lesson is one of patience, understanding, and accepting others, faults an all.   I hope to be able to experience many more sunsets. I, along with my sister, do plan on returning in February to share such an experience with our Auntie. Hopefully she can make it up the hill! If not well I guess we will carry her. This is one place I have found since moving here that I believe many people who have lived here all their lives fail to experience for what it is, a look into the beauty of life God has given to us.   For me the four stars represent the peace, the connection with others far away. Are you seeing the same sunset I see?

Clean. Friendly staff. Just what one needs to relax. Always get the strawberry drink unless I'm in the mood for coffee then it's a double shot!

Quaint store. Very very friendly. Clean. Mist spray if you choose to sit outside. The aroma of coffee when you enter is pleasant and not overwhelming.  So I finally strayed from my norm of strawberries and cream. I tried the orange mango smoothies. Wonderful! You could taste the banana, the orange and the mango. Simply mouth pleasing! I absolutely will have this again. I have always enjoyed the variety of flavors of coffee, now I have found other flavors!

So I called Domino's rival to order myself a pizza. I was told they couldn't make it the way I wanted. Hmmm, seeing how I am the one paying for an eating the pizza shouldn't I have it how I want? One would think so... Guess not with common pizza places.  Just like in life, you don't always get what you want when others think they know what you need.   So I call Domino's an I ask if they can make me a pizza the way I want it. Yep, they sure could and they sure did!  The wait time from placing the order to picking it up was 15 minutes. I arrived early so I sat in the car and waited. When I went in to pick up my pizza it had just came out of the oven. I was fearing as I had read reviews about this particular location that were less than pleasant.   Smiles. The staff were very friendly and professional. The price was actually less than the rival I had contacted earlier. The store was clean.   Pizza is pizza from the common pizza joints. It is what it is. All in all a wonderful experience. I'd come back.

I recently took my puppy to the Sun Valley Hope Animal Hospital, after being referred to the hospital by a coworker.    The drive from our home to the hospital was approximately 20 minutes.  Upon entering the parking lot, I missed the small sign pointing the way to the animal hospital.  In turn I ended up at the animal rescue that is located in the same building.  It is a no kill shelter.  The staff there were kind enough to point me in the direction I needed to go.    Upon entering the animal hospital I immediately noticed the large size of the waiting area.  Next I noticed the sign that read in part they do not provide 24 hour monitoring services at the hospital.  We checked in for our 1130 am appointment and took our seats.  I must say the choice of seating was not the most comfortable, however for a discount vet I do understand.  There was a TV there for the pleasure of those waiting to have their pets seen by the vet.  We waited approximately 10 minutes passed our appointment time, which to me is acceptable, as I am aware emergencies do occur.  We were taken to the exam room, which was clean and set up so that the doctor could exam the animal and provide the services necessary.  There was a counter and sink area with all the necessary medical set ups. The exam table was as expected as well. The doctor came in, Fernando Notario.  He was both professional and patient with all my questions.  He did not suggest treatments or procedures that were not necessary.  He did not attempt to persuade us into doing anything that was not necessary.    After providing the treatment that we had gone to receive we exited the exam room.  The cost of this appointment was far less than what was expected.  We will be returning in the future to complete the vaccines for our little puppy.  We will also be taking our cat here to have his nails trimmed, as I was very impressed with the price that they had quoted.  I made the decision to give this place a try as I had been told by others that they worked with people who thought their last resort was to put down their beloved pets.  Another reason I made the decision to come here was that the place is open on Sundays.   Is this like the typical vet office that I have been to in the past, no it isn't.  Do they provide the same services as others, yes they do, at a far more affordable price.  Does it matter to the animal if there is a treat at the end of the services, no it really doesn't.  What matters in the end to the pet is they know you care and love them.
