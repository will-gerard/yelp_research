Best waste of a Saturday night, the fact that the place was empty should have really sent the red flags flying! Meal made it to the table before the appetizer, soup and salad and yet the nonchalant attitude regarding the issue really baffled me (this is not a new place of business) anyway, don't waste your time and money here! It is too bad that there are no zero stars options.

I apologize but I reviewed the wrong restaurant as you can see by my picture. I am sure that this is a great restaurant which I will have to visit soon.

I am very disappointed with the service and the general manager.  I usually come here for Monday night football as well as pay per view fights. Tonight I came in for the boxing match,  I came in early so I can get a good table to watch the fight,  while the preliminary fights were going on,  the manager came up to me and told me that she was going to find me new friends and that they were going to sit at my table to which I replied,  I am waiting for my friends and she said well,  I will be back in a few minutes and if they are not here I am going to ask you to pay for your friends in advance or you are going to make new friends. Once again, I was there early so we could have a table. That manager is not a good business woman, she needs to learn how to treat customers as customers versus inmates. second, the service was incredibly slow and only saw our waiter seldomly, it would have been easier to walk to the bar to get my drinks. I don't know if I should give them a second chance or go somewhere where else where they want my money.

Great pizza, the problem is that any time I ask for extra pineapple, it appears as if I'm asking for the opposite. I will give more stars if you guys improve on your orders. I do come back because of the great flavor and quality but please follow the order.

Highly recomend Tina's. Great food and more great food! Service is the best and Tina always makes me us feel as if we are part of her family. I've been coming to Tina's for about a year now (3 or 4 times a month) lunch or dinner. I highly recomend. Once more, thank you Tina, btw my girls wanted to come see you tonight, I'll bring them next week. Thx: GABE  Ps. I can't wait to try your coffee.

I first must start by giving kudos to the service at Tina's.  It is a very good cultural experience where you don't have to travel far and feel as if you are in another country, the bread "teff" is amazing, and all those awesome flavors make this experience amazing. I highly recomend their food and their service "you will feel like a family member". Thank you.

This is my favorite sushi restaurant, I've been coming here for the last 4 almost 5 years (about once a week) The service is great and the food is second to none. If you like deep fried rolls, ask for the brother roll. Great prices as well, most places are more expensive and do not compare to the quality of food and service.

Highly recommend. This is my second time here and I see #3 on the way. I've had the (bistec encebollado & arroz imperial with shrimp "no melted cheese") I do recommend both plates. Next time I will try (ropa vieja) Great service! Ask for Kelly.

This place never disappoints, always great service and great food. Many different salsas to pick from and some of the best beans around.

I greatly dislike to leave negative comments but the food was tasteless and very poor looking,  the service was great (our server) very attentive and helpful,  when the manager came to our table he seemed incredibly nervous and just stood there looking at us (very uncomfortable) I could not hear him speak either and it was awkward, you could tell he had no interest or he did not care. Our prior visit I had really enjoyed our food, I ordered the same and regretted it. We left very disappointed.  Unfortunately I can't see us coming back.

Great service and very clean looking,  the staff is very courteous and helpful,  it has a feeling of family.  Very low prices and really big portions. So far I've had four different dishes and no disappointments. Highly recommend.
