I have only praise and appreciation for each and every clinician I have ever come into contact with at my Phoenix VA and the West Valley clinic in Surprise. My Rheumatology Team has to be the most caring staff of people I have ever encountered. I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis 2 years ago, it was a shock to go from being healthy and active to being in unbearable pain. I was desperate for relief and so frightened about how to cope with this disease. With the help and caring of the people at the Phoenix VA, I think I've learned to adapt very well. It's a process and I'm getting stronger every day. I can't thank them enough !

Saw the wonderful Dolly Parton here last night. Have seen quite a few concerts recently and was really excited to see Dolly.  She didn't disappoint me, however the theatre did !  The sound was deplorable !  How can a theatre host a concert with wonderful musicians and have crappy sound ?  The stage was a bigger let down ! half the seats in the house had a limited view of the stage. There was no stage jutting out into the audience, it was completely set back and half of the band and stage were an obstructed view for me. I overheard women in the restrooms complaining about the poor sound quality in the bathroom ! Ugh !

Wait for a table was almost intolerable ; 2.5 hours, wish my patience would have been rewarded with the world's greatest pizza. Sadly, it was not.  What a let down !

Love the ambiance . Quaint Urban setting in an old downtown home. Live music, patio dining as well as indoors.   Beer and Wine bar.

I'm a Yard house Veteran, my first visit was to the Costa Mesa California Yard house at Triangle Square. Had my very 1st Cosmo' Martini there many moons ago. After seeing a movie at the AMC Desert Ridge, my mom and I decided to pop in to the Yard House for a bite to eat, the food is usually really good. I ordered the Shitake Mushroom Noodles from the Snack menu and the Spring Rolls from the Hors Devours menu. The spring rolls were crunchy and tasty , my Noodles on the other hand .... I think they'd been sitting under the warming lights too long. They were mildly warm at best and kind of sticky. I was disappointed because I'd had those noodles before and they'd been really good when hot.  The server never came back to ask if everything was okay and when he did stop by he hurriedly refilled my water glass and kept it moving , almost as if he was nervous I'd ask him for something, he was obviously very busy. Drinks are expensive. I expect more from the Yard House .

I get the Drunken Shrimp Pasta (Shrimp Sauteed in a Tequila Lime Butter Sauce. Topped with  Pico, Fresh Limes and served on Spaghettini.)  It's so good !  I don't do spicy food , but this has the mildest kick to it . If I'm not in the mood for pasta, I get the Steak n' blue salad (Romaine Lettuce, Tomatoes, Walnuts. Thinly-Sliced Rib Eye Steak*, Sauteed with Mushrooms, Mixed Peppers, and Onions. Topped with Blue Cheese in a Sweet Vinaigrette.)  absolutely my favorite salad in town !

I was a member at the Surprise location years ago, I left and joined fitness 1.  Recently I have been thinking about returning to Mountainside, due to convenience of various locations. I read many of the reviews and was reminded of the reason I left years ago.  That "Enhancement Fee" is bogus, try budgeting monthly membership fees for upkeep and maintainance. Each time a member complained about the enhancement fee the manager had a lame response, "Enhancement Fee was mentioned in your contract" .   Booooo .....  I'm so glad YELP was there to help me decide.  I'm definitely not returning to Mountainside gym.

Love the Verrado Grille !  Enjoyed dining on the Patio where the fireplace adds such a warm touch at Sunset. Food was really good. I'm trying to convince my son and his fianc√© that they should hold their wedding reception here !

The Shaken Beef was out of this world !  Can't wait to go back again and again ! Trendy, quaint atmosphere. So happy to have something other than a chain restaurant here in Surprise !

Love Stand Up Live, I go often !  I was a regular at the Tempe Improv' and was sorrowfully disappointed when it closed down, but low and behold unto the Phoenix area a greater blessing was bestowed .... Stand Up Live !  I thoroughly enjoy being able to mix and mingle in the comfort (and air conditioning) of Copper Blues restaurant / Bar prior to show time, instead of baking in the heat of the Arizona sun while standing in a long line at the Improv' - what was I thinking ?  Now I'm not cranky by the time I'm seated for my comedy show, wonder if the comedians notice the difference in the demeanor of the crowd ?  Anyway, food choices are far better than they were at the Improv' too. Ticket prices for shows vary but are very reasonable.  There are comfy booth options which include bottle service, if you aren't into sitting at a crowded table next to people you may not know, but after you've met your 2 drink/item minimum, who really cares. Cheers to Laughing Out Loud !

Wild Orange Blossom Tea - could be enough said, but I'll elaborate a bit.  Was visiting the shops at Kierland Commons with my niece, who was visiting from Manchester England. A very polite employee asked if we'd like to try a sample of the best tea, not being a tea drinker myself, I thought it would be a challenge for Teavana to impress my British niece, who I consider to be the expert on tea. She has a special interest in Asian Tea Blends. Anyway, one sip of the Wild Orange Blossom Tea and we were hooked.  It's expensive, but something I've decided to indulge myself with. Love it !  Stopped in at the Arrowhead Teavana to refill my canister and ended up leaving with Rock Sugar and an additional Steeping Basket.  One of these days I'm going to leave that shop without spending $100 !!!

Love the Lazy Boy styled reclining chairs and wider aisles. So comfortable and cozy. All that was missing was a pillow and blankie. LOL   I'm diggin' the serve yourself candy , that helps move the concessions lines along much faster. Loved that I could select my seating at the time of ticket purchase. I'm waiting for the technology that allows me to order my popcorn and drinks delivered to my chair, so I don't have to struggle to carry my soda and popcorn up the stairs .... is that wrong ?
