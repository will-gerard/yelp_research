Floor outside Men's Room was wet and I slipped, nearly falling. Told this to Katrina the manager who responded with a totally uncaring, dismissive, and even suspicious attitude. Didn't tell anyone to clean up.   Sliders are tasty, though....

This place is like a jewel in the desert!  It's so charming and lovely inside. Nothing like just about every other place out here in STV. The staff is very friendly and professional. The Carrot Cake my wife and I enjoyed is exquisite! Dark, dense, moist, and flavorful. The Iced Chai Latte my wife had, she said, was delicious and the pour over coffee (from beans they roast themselves with a nice roaster right inside the front door) I enjoyed was surprisingly robust and bold without being astringent.  I'm definitely coming back here!

Much better WiFi than the Starbucks on Ellsworth & Rittenhouse in Queen Creek, AZ! (Good food and coffee, too.)

Food and coffee are typical Starbucks fare. Service is harried and a bit confused. Cleanliness is subpar - floor is often messy, looking like it hasn't been swept for a while. WiFi is abysmal (connection and speed on two separate iPhone 6S Pluses is so bad that the most info I can get out of testing software (OpenSignal as Speedtest won't even run a test with the WiFi, switching instead to my phone's Verizon cell signal) is that the Ping test takes a whopping 6 seconds! Note that that's 6,000 milliseconds - ping tests usually take no more than 500 milliseconds.) and has been ever since they opened. They report that the District Manager is aware... Does he not care? Does he not know how to get it fixed?  I don't know about other carriers but Verizon cell service in this spot is lousy too so overall internet connectivity at this store might as well be nonexistent. In other words, if you want to grab a coffee or tea and chill out, c'mon over. But, if you're thinking you're going to get any internet-based work done here, think again.
