Not bad, not great.  Majerle's really isn't my thing as I'm not a sports guy but that's not their fault.  Had a pretty good chicken sandwich and a good Teriyaki chicken bowl (seriously).  Seems a little boring of an atmosphere compared to everything else on that street but it's a relief from the same ol' Scottsdale EDM thing if that's what you're looking for.

I been a customer for more than a decade and have nothing but good things to say about Bobby and his crew.  During this time I've gone through 5 different Jeeps and a Tacoma and they are always my first call for parts.  If they don't stock something they can usually have it within a few days in most cases.  Will always remain a customer!

I had a friend's bike in need of a rear shock so I called the parts dept. and talked to Chris.  They had the part in stock and it was reasonably priced.  the problem was we were in south Scottsdale and we wouldn't be able to get up there before closing because it was the end of the day.  I also talked to Glen who said he lives right in my area and would deliver it to us on his way home!    We paid over the phone and Glen showed up a little while later with the part in hand just like they promised.  I've been in the automotive aftermarket for a long time and I've never heard of anyone going that far above and beyond for a customer.  Chris and Glen are SOLID guys and they have our business for life!

NOTE: THIS IS A 4 STAR REVIEW BECAUSE MY 5 STAR REVIEWS SEEM TO KEEP GETTING FILTERED BY YELP! (so frustrating)  George Carr and his office staff are definitely 5-star worthy, professional environment every step of the way.  Going back in soon for more extensive work and very comfortable with this work.  Thanks for everything guys, I've finally found a life-long dentist with Dr. Carr.

Going to try and not get filtered by Yelp so I'm updating this to a 5 star.  Went back for a whitening and the service and results were exactly what I expected, flawless.

Our tradition when heading to the lake or going off roading.  Great sandwiches at a great location.  Small place and a little hard to get a table if you plan on eating in but we're usually ordering to go so not a big deal.  Wish they ere open Sundays as we're always driving by a closed store these days.  Will be back next time we hit the lake!

If you can fit into this itty bitty Country bar you'll definitely have a good time and I don't even listen to Country.  The live music on weekends is always the same band and same setlist but I love it every time.  Cheap drinks and friendly people are always found here.  Zero Scottsdale pretentiousness and lively people, even if they may have been a little overserved.  You can find me most weekend nights here, it never gets old!

I absolutely HATE giving bad reviews and you gotta screw up BAD to get 1-star from me so this 2 star review is solely form our last experience a few months back.  The server (guy, don't recall the name) was polite but was MIA after taking our order which took a HOUR to show up!  Not once during this hour did he stop by to refill waters, let us know that our order will be up soon, nothing.  The table next to us was talking about having the same issue, mind you this was during a time when there were about 5 tables sat in the entire place.  We talked to them about the service and they had the same issue with the waiter, they were a lot less understanding about this and were getting a little irritated.  We've had good experiences in the past but restaurants are always as good as your last experience and in this case, we may not be back.  Sucks too because we really liked this place.

I hate to rate this place so low because I've been coming here for years and the food and atmosphere are amazing.   They pull off the speakeasy vibe very well and the dimly lit wine bar feel is very hard to come by in old town Scottsdale.  On our last visit the food was of course spot on, the staff was great and the service was near perfect.  The 2 stars comes form the insanely loud live jazz music.  There was a live band playing that night which not only cost us $5 at the door (no one charges a cover in Scottsdale anymore) but the volume was so loud I felt like we were in some weird dance club time warp.  Jazz being played at nightclub volumes was not only out of place but so annoying we decided to leave early.  "What???"....."WHAT???"  I still can't hear you, sorry.  I don't mind live music and even loud as hell music but when paired with a wine bar it just doesn't make sense.

This place reminds me on a throwback roadside diner in Barstow or somewhere like that.  Great service and the food is unbelievable not to mention to portions are huge.  Now that that accept debit cards I'll be in more often as I rarely carry cash.  You aren't allowed to use your cell phone in here so keep in it your pocket, you can deal without yakking on the phone for that time period anyway, you may just make a new friend!

Great food and great service!  Was forced to try several things by the girlfriend that I would normally not get anywhere close to and loved it all!  Don't remember the server's name by he was very professional and very attentive.  Long lines on weekends so make reservations if going on a Friday or Saturday night.

Great food as always.  Seemed to be a little dead around 8pm on a Saturday night, very few tables sat so if you're looking for the busy nightlife crowd, this may not be your place.  On the other hand if you're looking to get seated right away and have excellent service, definitely check out this location.

Damn good pizza!  Thin crust and served just how I like.  Parking is a little tough but it's old town, the same goes for every place in the area.  Sat at the bar last time we went and the service was spot on.  We're becoming regulars and this is our new go-to pizza joint.

Took my Jeep in to Ike who diagnosed the problem and got the repairs done same day, a day sooner than we agreed on.  The price was about what I expected and the repairs were done correctly even though he had to deal with aftermarket parts that we unsure of the brand.  Will bring all my vehicles back for sure!

I'm not a vegetarian but Green's burger was very good.  My girlfriend is a regular there and can't say enough good things so we finally went and have dinner there.  Had the Calexico burger (?) which was better than I thought it would be since I'm not a huge fan of soy.  I'll be joining her next time she goes back for sure!

So surprised by the awesome service here!!  I'm in the restaurant and bar business and we've tried everything in our power to get our staff to upsell and mention specials to their tables like the staff at Macayo's did.  This place nailed it.  Friendly service form the hostess to the servers to the food runners to management.  Our server presented specials which we both bought.  Upsold us on sides of guac and other upgrades which we also bought.  Bought the signature cocktails that she recommended which were priced higher than most drinks.  Not sure what their training technique is here but it's working.  Great experience and just like Schwarzenegger I'll be back!

Food and service were great.  Went with my girlfriend and mom and they both had a great time.  On weekends there's usually great people watching.  You may be able to catch the 60 year old guy in a Don Johnson linen suit with his harem of 6 or so models laughing hilariously at everything he says, if you do it's a great time!   The place is always clean and looks great.  Will be back for sure.

The Double Down is a true shithole.  The drinks are not good, the smell is something I can't quite place (thankfully), the girls are seedy and the music is loud.    So why 5 stars?  Cuz fuck you, that's why!  This place is my kinda joint, gritty and punk rock.  Will always go back when in town.

Heading to the Luxor this weekend and have stayed there several times in the past.  Coming from the hospitality business myself I'm very aware of how powerful Yelp can be for a business.  Most of these negative reviews are coming from unreal expectations, it's common sense that older hotels will have more wear and tear and not offer state of the art amenities.    A 1 star review for no coffee maker??  Come on people, grow up and stop being such pussies.   Then go downstairs to Starbucks, they make a better cup than you do anyway.  Are there nicer options out there for hotels?  Absolutely but not at this price.  You're not staying at the Luxor for luxurious spotless rooms, you're staying there because it's on the strip and cheap.  It probably needs a renovation but once that happens, people will probably complain about the "new, higher prices".     Sometimes even when you win, you lose...

I wish we would have gotten in to give a true review but how good can it be when the doormen think they're working the door of Marquee or something.....  Too soon??  I know the drill- bring more girls than dudes, make sure they're hot, be patient, don't act like a douche.  Check.  Still nothing, they said they were sold out and when we turned around to leave they said, just to the guys "well lets talk about this..", code for give me some money.   I get the whole grease-the-doorguy-or wait-in-line thing but after they turned down $50 for the whole group we left.  Something about some celebrity I've never heard of being in there.  They need to remember that some aspect of their job is hospitality.

One of the best places in the world for flair bartenders, a lot of these guys were in the Legends of Bartending flair competition and many of them won.  Much respect for their skills and patience for drunken assholes.  They get huge well deserved tips, especially from me and anyone I bring there with me.    TRUE STORY - I lived in Vegas a while back and would bring friends who were visiting to Carnival Court so they could watch these guys flair.  I went there half a dozen times over a year period and didn't know any of them by name nor did I have a conversation with any of them.  I'd just order my Jack and Coke and bartender's choice for whoever I was with.  I moved out of town and was back visiting Carnival Court a few years later.  I remembered the guy who used to serve me years ago from his name tag "Christian".   He looked at me and took a few seconds to say "Jack and Coke right?"  2 years later!!   Truly amazing memory which warranted a $100 tip, these guys are at the top of their game for sure!  The downside, however expected, is the perpetually sticky floor and pretty much sticky everything.  Go easy if you have nice shoes on or pants that may come in contact with this floor, other than that it's an awesome time.

Great pizza!  We came for a Jeep club meet and greet and had to try the food.  Some of the best pizza we've had, totally ruined every bit of diet we were on but it was worth it.  Every inch of wall space is covered in sharpie writing which is a cool aspect.  Service was great as well, will be back when on that side of town again.

Probably in the top 5 sandwiches I've ever had.  D lish keeps the mom and pop vibe perfectly and continues to provide great service as well.  The drive thru is a little tight but I won't hold that against them.  Love to support small businesses like them and they very much deserve it.

I also hate to give negative reviews but this is the one company that truly needs to get their shit together.  This review is a culmination of my 10+ year experience with Cox.  Terrible customer service, hold times are outrageous, issues are rarely fixed in a timely manner.  In a previous house I owned, over the course of 2 years they had to come out to fix the internet 25 times!  (Yes I kept track).  Of course every time it was the same story "We found the issue THIS time, you're definitely good to go now".  Wrong.  If they didn't have a monopoly on cable internet service, Cox would go out of business the day after a competitor opened their doors.  Century Link unfortunately doesn't have anywhere near the geographical reach Cox does.

Heard about these guys on the radio and a friend had tried them with good results so I thought I'd give them a shot.  Carpet came out pretty good, not prefect but good enough.  Tile and grout came out looking like brand new!  They take steps to insure there is no damage to the house by their equipment and pay attention to detail, would definitely use them again.  3 rooms of carpet and a huge living room of tile was about $130, not a bad deal.

Our server Bailey was awesome!  I'm in the restaurant business as well and might steal her.  Always a smile and checked on us several times during our visit.  Had the Margherita pizza which was great as well.  I don't usually like chain pizza joints but for the price they hit the mark.  Bailey deserved my 30% tip, we'll be back because of her.

Great atmosphere and a huge place.  They definitely put some thought into the build-out.  Their specialty rolls are pretty good for the most part and the service is on point.  Some of the menus and soy sauce containers were a bit sticky and dirty but nothing that would prevent me from returning.

My kind of shithole!  Definitely a dive bar but that's my kind of my thing so we had a great time considering we were working on very little sleep form the night before.  The bartenders were very nice and made us feel at home.  Turns out with the type of liquor license they have you can take drinks out of the bar with you!  Felt so unnatural to do so but I guess it's allowed there.  Will be back!

Very trendy nightlife spot in old town.  Not a great spot for families especially toward the later dinner times but is a great place for groups to get some awesome sushi and drinks.  Priced about the same as the rest of old town so you'll spend some money here but it's worth it.

Since the transition from Danny's to Jacksons, quality seemed to drop even worse if that's possible.  Got an oil change and from the waiting area you can see into the garage bay where the oil changes take place.  2 guys were trying to close my hood and the latch obviously wasn't lining up so instead of opening the hood back up and fixing it, they both pounded on the hood until it bent the latch almost beyond repair.  I had to knock on the glass and tell them the latch wasn't lined up correctly (I hate doing that because I'm sure they can't stand customer's micromanaging them).  Anyway, when I got the vehicle back, there were greasy hand prints EVERYWHERE.  The hood, fenders, doors, sides, steering wheel all had black oily prints which were noticeable from a distance.     2 stars because one of the techs was very polite.  I had such high hopes for this place too...

Amazingly clean rooms and a great atmosphere.  My parents were visiting from out of town over Thanksgiving and I put them up at the W.  They had a great time and were really impressed by the place, the service and the attention to detail.  Will definitely book them a room here again on their next visit.

The Lodge is a great break form the normal Scottsdale Shenanigans.  Everyone fits in no mater what you're wearing or who you are, it's kinda like a little Vegas minus the gambling, money, hotels, glitz, bottle service, table reservations, cover charges, $13 cocktails and I'm sure much more.  Weather permitting the patio is awesome for playing bags or just hanging out in the shade.  Drinks are cheap for Scottsdale and the scenery is awesome.

Had a flat repaired here and they were nice and polite behind the counter.  Car was done on time and for $20 which is cheap but Discount does flat repairs for free so I had to knock them down a star.  They are right next to my work so in this case the $20 was worth the close proximity.  Great experience, will be back.

As an owner of a Jeep JK and a pickup I have been a long time customer of 4 Wheel Parts and have always had great experiences with them both here and in Mesa.  They always match any legit price I bring them without issue and if they don't stock what I need, they usually get it within days.    Any Jeep owner can't go wrong with the staff knowledge and parts they stock on hand, I've learned a lot form them and have avoided several pitfalls by using them instead of the smaller shops who are there one week and gone the next. They even warranteed a part for me that they really didn't have to as a customer service gesture.  Will be back for sure for all future vehicle purchases!

This review is only for brunch Sundays as I haven't been here other than a few Sundays.  The mimosas are bottomless and $15 (I think) if you buy food.  They are weak as hell but that's the nature of a mimosa so no big deal.   Rnr is a typical Scottsdale brunch spot that's loud and filled with hungover people having a little hair of the dog  so we fit right in.  The quesadilla was bigger and better than I thought it would be.  We usually go to El Hefe on Sundays but since it's closed for a remodel, RnR is a great place to go have a few.

I've lived in old town Scottsdale forever but somehow never made it into Barrio Queen but I'm glad we finally gave it a shot.  Had an amazing burrito and my girlfriend had something that I don't remember what it was but I remember loving the 1 bite I had.    Great atmosphere and the service was quick.  Would recommend this place to anyone, especially for a special date night.

Went there for the first time and my first impression was how clean everything was.  No wet dog smell, no gross floors, nothing.  The wash service starts at $13 so it's pretty easy to deal with.  The tubs you put your dog in are clean and offer shampoo that comes straight out of the water nozzle so you don't have to use separate bottles if you don't want to.  Instead of drying with towels, they have a blow-dryer type of set up that dries a medium sized dog in about 5 minutes.  The dog treats and toys are a little pricey but that's not why you go there, just a convenience.  (I bought 3 dog toys).

The BYOB burger (build your own) was awesome not to mention HUGE!  There are 2 size options, the relapse and the rehab (can't remember which one is bigger) but my girlfriend and I got the bigger one and shared it.  We were both full and walked out with a $14 lunch tab, not bad.  Can't remember our server's name but he was a guy with a short beard who was great.  Positive vibes throughout this place.

I agree with a lot of these reviews.  The equipment is nice and clean and the facility is brand new BUT, definitely don't try to do any out-of-the-box workouts or get creative with the weights, you will be promptly asked to stop.  This is the opposite of Golds when it comes to working out how you want to.  Other than this I don't have a lot of negatives to mention about the facility.  The admin side of the place is a typical gym, not very friendly (I don't blame these employees making minimum wage, I'd be a dick too if I couldn't make my rent while working full time.  You get back what you pay your employees).    The contract is bullshit and there are so many hidden fees and loopholes to screw you out of money the initial low monthly price will be made up for in cancellation fees, late fees, and your dues go up by $5/ mo. on your second year anyway.  God help you if you try and cancel!  They make it as inconvenient as possible to cancel so you'll just give up trying.  LA Fitness does the same thing and that's why I left there but apparently looking at these other reviews YouFit does the same thing.  Can't wait for that fight.  If you have the option DO NOT sign the contract, go month to month if it's still an option.  The additional cost is well worth it in the long run.

Our server Kim saved this review from 3 stars, she was awesome and the best part of the experience.  We had 2 dirty cocktail glasses in 1 round that we had swapped out but the food was pretty solid.  Pretty good atmosphere and the outdoor patio is great for people watching.  Will be back again just not in a hurry to return.

Great all-in-one type of place!  The Yard has a little bit of everything for everyone.  If you are bored here, well you probably just suck.  Food is good as were the drinks and service.  The only issue I have is that you HAVE to valet park here, no self parking available.  This increases the bill since I'm a pretty generous tipper but at least I know my car is safe.  It would still be nice to have a self park option.

Tried this place for the first time over the weekend, it was a suggestion from the girlfriend and turned out great!  Great friendly customer service, you can tell the people there really do care about their jobs and take it seriously, rare these days in restaurants. Tacos were HUGE, we could have split an order between us so don't be scared of the $10 price tag for a couple fish tacos.  Will be back for sure when in the area.

I'm not a huge fan of strip mall sushi joints but the reviews were good so we figured we'd give it a try.  It was dead at the time, we were one of 2 tables so the service was fast.  The rolls were very good and the fish was fresh, no complaints on food at all.  The ambiance left a little to be desired but again, I'm not a fan of strip mall sushi joints.  We'll be back if on that side of town again.

Quickest and best hangover cures I've seen, it's like 10 Bloody Mary's at once!  Ok that's probably not a good idea but their IV drips do the job for sure.  They have a B12 shot once a week monthly sign up deal for about 1/4 of the normal price so if you're a fan of regular B12 shots, this is your place.  Very nice people and VERY clean place.

Went for Saturday brunch - great service and drinks at the bar which took a horrible turn for the worse as we were seated.  The server had to be brand new at this job, at serving in general actually so maybe it wasn't her fault being thrown to the wolves with little to no training.  Our order took about 40 minutes to arrive which wasn't a big deal at first.  Drinks were  very slow to be refilled, we had the margaritas in the goblets.  The drinks kept coming but the empties were never picked up so there was a battlefield of dead soldiers that took up nearly the entire table!    It went from annoying to hilarious because the server visited the table to drop off more drinks and would have to push the empties back just enough for the new drinks to be balanced on the edge of the table, never once did she take the empties away.  What made it even funnier was after waiting a looooong time for another round, the marg showed up, ice totally melted, straw floating sideways on the top, so we could tell it was sitting in the service well for over a half an hour.  She looked up at me kinda knowing the drink wasn't right but she was over it at that point.  I told her it was fine, didn't want to wait another half hour for a replacement.  Paid our tab and never went back, lesson learned.  Oh yeah, my burrito was terrible as well, took 2 bites and left it alone.  The new build out was pretty cool though, I don't want to come off totally negative.

I had a concrete pad installed at my residence about a year ago so it's been a while but I thought it was time for a review.  The pad was about 400 sq. ft. and around the house in the backyard, way beyond my level of expertise so I found CSI on homeadvisor.com so they were already pre-screened.  They were on time and there were no surprises.  Final costs were exactly what we agreed on and the work was flawless.  I'll be using them again in the future for sure.

Great bland of Asian and Mexican cuisine.  Some of the most unique tastes I've ever had!  Great drink menu as well, have the Cadillac Marg which was awesome, ok maybe I had a couple.  We've been back a few times since our first visit and will continue to visit here when we can afford it.  "Good aint cheap, cheap aint good."

Finally checked it out this weekend, love the build-out with the exception of the floors, didn't know the particle board look was fashionable right now, or maybe it's temporary?  Anyway, huge improvement from Martini Ranch.  Staff wasn't really smiling or making eye contact but were friendly enough.  Southern Comfort promo girls were the friendliest in the whole place.  Had a drink and left but will be back with a bigger group.

My kind of place!  A dive bar but not in a dirty way, the old stage from The Western has been turned into game room which is pretty cool.  A very relaxed option for old town Scottsdale, will be back for sure.

Great atmosphere and awesome friendly service.  The building is a little hard to find but worth it.  The decor is definitely upscale but without the upscale price.  It's a little out of the way for me but I'll come back for sure when on that side of town.

It's a little hard to figure out where Forge ends and the rest of the shopping area starts, it's a strange layout.  The pizza was great even though I really don't have that defined of a taste for gourmet pizza.  The mozzarella isn't covering the pizza like you're probably used to, it's in little pillows like you'd see on the Food Network.  Very tasty and the crust was perfect.  The chef gave us a few samples of his made from scratch chocolate and it was some of the best we've ever had.  Will definitely be back!

Awesome location with 1 side opening to the casino and the other opening to the strip.  Some of the best food and service we've ever had in Vegas!  Prices and quality were reasonable, we're glad we got the recommendation from a friend on this one, Tom's is a great retreat form the high priced, long lined trendy night-clubbish restaurants all over Vegas.  Will make it a point to return next time we're in town.

When did we become such pussies?  I like Bevvy just fine but this review is in protest to the 1-star "we walked around a packed bar and couldn't get a table so we left, will NEVER come back" reviewers.  It's too bad Yelp gives people an open ended license to spread their candy-assed opinions about real businesses trying their best to be all things to all people.  If you're going to venture into an entertainment district which is busy by definition and then complain because it's too busy, please stay home, Netflix has come a long way anyway.  Know what you're getting into and don't expect 5-star service with 1-star prices.  Good aint cheap and cheap aint good.  Old town just like any trendy nightlife area is expensive, if you can't handle this don't go.  If you can't afford to tip, you can't afford to drink at a bar.  Continue to sit home with your 10 cats and a bottle of Kamchatka, the bars won't miss you.   Thumbs up to all nightlife employees who bust their asses and actually care about improving their business and make the best customer experience possible.  Being the sober person around a bunch of drunk children who constantly lose their card, phone, purse and dignity on a weekly basis isn't easy.  Just think before you potentially hurt a business because someone took 5 seconds too long to acknowledge you at the door.  Bevvy has true professionals working there and every experience I've had there has been top-notch, thanks guys!

Great food and a pretty cool east coast beach vibe if you're into that sort of thing.  Attractive staff and a very clean feel to the dining room.  Had the fish tacos which were very good, I'd have them again.  The layout is almost identical to how it was when the building was The Bungalow so if you liked that, you'll dig this place.  Not sure how the nightlife is there if any, will check it out at night some day.

Great improvement from the Shotgun Betty's days.  Best late night food in the whole area.  Had the mac and cheese at around midnight and was pleasantly surprised the kitchen was still open, glad we stopped in!

Our server disappeared upon seating us.  Apparently she pulled the same disappearing act with the table next to us, we started a conversation with them and they said they had been waiting over an hour with no food and no sign of the server.  When both of our table's food showed up, we promptly asked for our check so we wouldn't have to burn another hour waiting for the return of our server.  Our water never did show up so we had to share with our new friends who were happy to ration the existing waters.  I HATE giving 1-star reviews so they get 1-star for being open that day and another for giving us the opportunity to make new friends.  We were in town for the Nightclub & Bar convention and there were plenty of us there that day, not a good day to be that far off your game.

I hope they survive because I'm pretty sure this building is cursed.  It's been closed down more than it's been open during recent years and has been several short-lived dance-ish concepts.  It doesn't really look like a "wine" place on the outside, it still looks very contemporary/ modern dance-club-like.  Food, drinks and service were good, nothing out of the ordinary but no complaints.  Will be back if in the area.

Awesome fish tacos!  Great east coast Martha's Vineyard vibe with the decor.  My girlfriend had the Lobster Rolls which were unbelievably good, wish there was more of them.  Will be back for happy hour for sure!

Totally agree with Keeley's review, I got the same treatment while trying to get a simple answer about pricing.  It's not the rep's fault, they are taught this bullshit tactic by upper upper management to try and confuse the potential customer into giving up all hope of a clear answer and just giving up their credit card.   It's called "Perceived value" - starting high and discounting it back down to normal prices making it look like you're getting a huge discount.  My story is just as long as Keeley's and even gets worse, I tried calling 5 different times and talked to 5 different people before giving up myself....and going with Directv.    NOTE: This review doesn't reflect my experience with this specific Dish Network provider or installer, just the company in general.  Dish has gotten such horrific reviews that they cleverly disguised their corporate Yelp profile in a sea of "authorized dealer" profiles so we can't review them directly.

Love Rage!  Have been taking 3 different bikes there over the years and the service and repairs have always been top-notch.   I can't believe how cheap the repair rates are, save yourself the headache and have them do the work.    Parts and accessories and surprisingly cheap, about the same as shopping online.

The decor and atmosphere could have been better, after all it's a strip-mall sushi joint which I'm always leery of but the quality of the food and the freshness of the fish more than made up for it.  Freshest sushi I've had in a long time!

Very cool indoor/ outdoor restaurant with a dog friendly patio.  Great burgers as well.  My girlfriend and I had a great time here during the art exhibit.  Will be back for sure when in Tempe next time!

Sushi in a bowl instead of a roll??  Who knew it would be this good?!  When this place was it's previous fish concept Ahi Mahi we tried it and honestly wouldn't have come back.  The fried fish was swimming in grease and the portions were way too big.  It was also pretty dead during the day back then.  I've never seen such a dramatic turn around by a simple tweaking of the concept.  The sushi grade fish is very fresh and the place is PACKED now.  We went on a Sunday around lunchtime and the line was out the door.  So go early or late for lunch to avoid the lines.  Will be back!
