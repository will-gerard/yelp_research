Even if I hadn't visited the NY Hall of Science in NYC, just by itself the Arizona Science Center is not that great. The Grossology exhibit is not worth the money. In fact, the experience as a whole is not worth the money.  For two student tickets and two special exhibits, I paid nearly $40.  This place is definitely for kiddies, like children no older than five I'd say. Past that age, and they would be bored. There's a special bike that you can ride up in the air on a rope (for $5), but it's such a short distance and you have to peddle backwards from where you begin in order to ride forward - it's really as stupid as it sounds.  There needs to be more hands-on activities and not just kiddy activities like taking apart a puzzle. Seriously, why are there a myriad of deviations of puzzles?  The science center in nyc - you can learn about the psychology behind vision and how your brain tricks you... there was the largest gingerbread cookie village for a while, etc. Plus, everything was so fascinating for adults as well. The az science center pales in comparison.

My friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday. Once 7pm rolls around, more people start to arrive - available seating and parking reduces dramatically. Also, I would come before 7 on a Wednesday to take advantage of happy hour 5-7pm.   Our orders took a while to come out. I ordered the Big Jim [$11], which was great. Fried chicken, bacon, gravy, biscuits, cheese. With random pieces of watermelon. The poutine [$9] just with the  gravy on top was meh ahahah. The fries weren't that great.   The beignets were pretty good, except all of the honey sauce pooled into the bottom so the bottom beignets were overly drenched and way too sweet.   The neighborhood is kind of sketchy, but Welcome Diner is on the same street as JoBot and Melt, so you can walk down and enjoy your time there.

My friend and I visited the Desert Botanical Garden for their flashlight tour on a Thursday night, and it was a great way to see all of the different cacti without trying to stay alive under the hot az sun at the same time.  I obtained a culture pass from the local library so we could go for free (student admission normally ~$10), and I brought my jumbo flashlight. Maybe should have put on some bug spray; we didn't do that, and I had to run my hand over every exposed part of my body every few minutes.  We both wore flip flops and were perfectly fine walking through the garden.  This experience is perfect for any age. I would come back with my parents and even grandparents since the trail is pretty easy to go through. There are volunteers who have set up a table and wear string lights around their neck so you can quickly locate them, which was pretty cute. I learned about the saguaros and bats and owls, and there are even some things (like bracelets and pendants) you can make and take back home with you.

I had lunch here today with a friend around 1pm, and it was empty, except for one or two parties. However, I felt reassured when I realized the owner was Japanese.  I ordered the Katsu-don and my friend ordered the unagi don off the lunch menu, so both of our orders were each under $10. Really reasonable, especially with the addition of miso soup, salad, and dumpling & chicken skewer.  We both ate everything - we were super hungry but the meal was also really good.  Decor is alright - pretty outdated, but the food was great, so I can't complain too much. I would definitely come back!

Great place to study. I only come here on Sunday mornings, so I wouldn't know how it's like on other days, but I come here here every Sunday and it's consistently never crowded and quiet.   The usual customer base is older ladies and men. The music is soft. The employees are friendly. There's free wifi and outlets near a couple tables.

The place was a mess. Granted, it was a Saturday night, but still. C'mon guys. My colleagues and I arrived around 6, sat down, and for the next 30 minutes, we were neither greeted by a server nor could we flag one down (because they were just so elusive!).   We finally were able to order a couple appetizers to share, and they were okay. Salmon sashimi decent. Avocado spring roll wasn't bad actually - the sauce that came with it was probably one of the best things about the night. Fries - meh.  The Macadamia Nut Chicken ($19) was pretty good, except for what was supposed to be the star of the plate. The chicken was lackluster and barely crusted or cooked. One of my colleagues who ordered the same dish - his chicken was chewy and it turned out to be under-cooked. A colleague who ordered the Miso-Sake Sea Bass couldn't finish the ratatouille part cause some spice was so overpowering.  The service was nonexistent. We had so much trouble just trying to get salt onto the table or to get the bill. The entrees also took so long to prepare. I don't even understand how it was possible to take so long.  I would not come back. It's not worth it - esp. for how much money Kona charges too.

This is the only Ted's location outside of NY, so my friend was super excited to try it out. He'd grown up eating it, but it was my first time ever stepping into a Ted's and eating one of their dogs. It was everything my friend told me it would be.  I added mac and cheese to my dog and that made it so delicious. The onion rings were crunchy and flavorful. I would definitely come back here again. The loganberry drink is so good - not too sweet at all.

Ohhmygosh, I loved it here. The museum is just the right size to get through everything and not be tired out and also to not be bored too quickly. I think the curators have done an excellent job of selecting and organizing these works of art.  Personally speaking, I'm really glad the contemporary art isn't too out there and is actually relateable. When my parents come to visit, I shall take them here. Overall, a good place to recommend for any visitors.

After moving to AZ,  I noticed Lo-Lo's when I would drive around, so one night a friend and I decided to check it out, and we ended up loving our experience there. We arrived for dinner, and we were immediately greeted by a super friendly and chill waiter named AJ. He told us what people usually order and even if a dish would be too big to consume in one sitting.  My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered biscuits and gravy, potatoes, and eggs. The pieces of chicken were super crunchy. The biscuits were ginormous - I think one is the size of my fist. Lo-Lo's also has kool-aid on tap, which is amazing. I hadn't drank kool-aid since I was maybe in elementary school and consequently had forgotten how deliciously sweet and addicting it is.  The portions are huge for the money you pay, the decor is fun and bright and clean, and the service is great. I am definitely coming back. very soon.

The Chicken Shawarma - so good!   Atmosphere: not there? But the tables were actually set up in a way in which I felt cozy eating there with my friend. The restaurant/store isn't dressed up in any way, and it felt comfortable.  Service: friendly. The workers joke around with you.   Price: reasonable! I paid $~9 for my meal.

I came into the shop a couple weeks ago to purchase a simple cruiser, and I had a pretty good time. People were friendly; I was helped right away. They held the bike for me, so I could pick it up later in the day. I got to try the one I would buy in the parking lot. One of the ladies got the door for me so I could get the bike out with no trouble.  Phat Cycles Womens' Sea Wind ($170) Basket ($30) Bike Lock ($41) Front light (~$17)  The bike accessories were expensive. I would have purchased them elsewhere but I just wanted to get everything in the same place.

I came here with a friend after hearing about it from others and the great deals they had found. From the outset, the place looks like a mess - kind of reminded me of a thrift store, with rows of unorganized clothing. My expectations immediately plummeted. The section of scarves and bras was a mess (like your underwear drawer overturned onto your bed), but a bunch of people seemed to be diligently digging through them.  The shoes section is kind of tricky because many of them look a bit used. So, they have some scratches on the tops and most likely than not, the bottoms are really dirty. If you're fine with that though, the prices seemed to be reasonable.  I found a couple items from the clothing section (in the hour I was at the store): 1.) Topshop tank top for $5 2.) comfy boho shorts by allen allen for $9  ^ The prices are pretty crazy. I saw several articles of clothing from topshop for so much less than it usually is.  If you invest a little bit of time and make sure the clothing doesn't have holes or stains, then you're in for a treat.

[RESERVATION] I had been meaning to go here for a while. However, when I came with my parents for dinner, the hostess told us the restaurant would have an opening two hours later. When I came here with friends, some time later, they told us the same thing. Long story short, you should make a reservation. I was able to get a table for a Sunday night when I called two days before having dinner with my family.  I don't think the Olive and Ivy sign does the restaurant justice, because it makes it seem like the usual casual, chain restaurant. However, the inside is great (just a tad too dimly lit). There are jars with lights in them hanging down from the ceiling and a view of the river(?)/creek next to the restaurant. It is kind of loud as well.  [APPETIZERS] We were served complimentary homemade focaccia bread and pesto sauce. For appetizers, we ordered "Choose 3 for $11" bruschetta and Kale Salad [$11]. The butternut squash was my favorite. The prosciutto and fig was also very good. The amount that they give you for the salad is pretty filling. I think this is good to share because I feel like I would become bored with it if I just ordered that for myself.  [ENTREES] The Prosciutto and Marscarpone Tortelli [$16] doesn't look well put together. I was actually disappointed by the presentation when it first came out because it doesn't look like it will taste good. However, it tastes amazing. The sauce used in this dish is great to dip bread in.  My brother ordered the Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin [$24], which was amazing. I don't usually order pork because I fear it will be tough and not flavorful, but the bacon definitely was a great addition. I don't know what they did to the brussels sprouts but whatever bad taste they left in your mouth the last time you decided to give them a chance will go away once you try these.   Shrimp Risotto [$25] was good - my dad really liked it. I'm just not much of a risotto person - I think that's what I'm starting to realize about myself. But if risotto is what you like, then you won't be dissatisfied.   My mom ordered the Pacific Sea Bass (I think). I thought the presentation for this was well done.  [DESSERTS] Desserts I would suggest that you get elsewhere. I mean, they were okay, but nothing amazing. We ordered the bread pudding(?) that comes with a scoop of ice cream and lemon blueberry cake.

I read about the 1 hr parking thing from other yelpers, and the dude who checks if you actually leave after an hr exists. I went into the parking lot in the back of Cartel Coffee Lab, and the guy (who's in a white shirt with "parking security" or whtever) was walking around with this pen and notebook in hand.  The inside of the coffee lab is pretty big. lots of tables to chill at. I had the cold brew, which was $2.50. It was pretty good. I would need to try other drinks they offer to better review them, but from what I experienced today, I wouldn't mind going again.

My friend and I came on a Tuesday night. We were given a brief informational lesson about how to paint the clay pieces by an employee.   However, we were told that drawing with pencil and permanent marker was fine because they would burn off, which turned out to be wrong. Also, we were told to leave the price sticker on our clay pieces. My final mug was dark, so any pencil marks, if there was any, was unnoticeable. My friend's dish had very apparent pencil marks - even when she had painted and repainted the dish white so many times I bet she had added another inch to the dish's diameter.   Overall, we had a great time during the painting process (the place was clean and there were many cool clay pieces) but the final product (due to poor and incorrect instructions) left us greatly disappointed.  We were compensated with two free studio passes.

I had early dinner (5pm) here today with my parents, and we had such a good time!  Parking wasn't a problem at 5 and also not a problem when we left around 6:40pm on a Thursday night. While the inside tables were full as we were leaving, the outside seating was very much available.  The waitress who served us throughout the night was a sweet lady who called me and even my dad "honey."  The brushetta ($14) was delicious - esp. the brie and apple, bacon & arugula. The tomato, basil & mozzarella was okay, but not stellar.   My parents and I all had the split two ($10). The salads are pretty similar. My mom couldn't really tell them apart.  The prosciutto with brie was great as was the soup of the moment (kale & sausage).   After dinner, we shared a creme brulee ($7) that was not overly sweet - it was just right!   The ambience of the restaurant was amazing - as the sun went down, servers placed candles on each table.  Cons: 1. No reservations (only for 8 ppl and larger)

I was pleasantly surprised when I visited this museum the other day with my parents. When I first came to AZ, I had no dreams of going to this museum. It was only when I heard from others how amazing it was and how one person even cried after visiting that I began to question my initial opinions about MIM.   There are no discount that I know of if you're past 18 yrs of age. So, we paid for three ($20) tickets and received a kind of hefty device and headphones and we began our musical journey.  Highlights of my visit:  1) Learning how pianos are made (video with interviews & deconstructed piano on display) and how cymbals of drum sets are made  2) MIM has Taylor Swift's electric banjo and dresses she's worn at her concerts!!!  3) The Experience Room - you get to hit a huge gong. Nice. and there's a self-playing piano.   It's very soothing to wander around and have music just play (you don't have o press anything!) When my parents and I went, it was around 2pm on a Wednesday so there were barely any people.

Pros: 1. The scallops, meatloaf, and sea bass entrees were all very delicious and flavorful and cooked properly. The meatloaf is very filling; it comes with mashed potatoes that is so velvety and buttery. I loved the sauce that came with the scallops.  2. Convenient location; lots of parking (free) 3. Food arrives quickly  Cons: 1. The restaurant is very dimly lit. 2. Extremely loud, not from the music but from so many people packed into one room 3. The actual restaurant doesn't look as nice as in the pictures. The place is kind of plain.   Definitely a place to go to for the food more than the ambience, and I would go during an off peak time so that you can hear what your dinner mates are saying.

I came here with my friend around ~10 or 11 am on a Saturday, and the place was packed. The line was nearly out the door. You order at the counter, get a number, and then find a table at which a waiter will come find you with your meal.   I ordered the Original Chop Salad [$10] because the pictures that I had seen of it online were gorgeous. My friend had the Classic Eggs Benedict [$9].  The chop salad is as beautiful as it looks in pictures. It's delicious too. The salad dressing is a light pesto sauce that coats your salad just enough. I hate when the dressing is so overpowering or when the salad is drenched in sauce.   There were some spots on the street available (you have to pay by the hour), so it wasn't too much of an issue.

I liked the concept, which is why I tried it out, but the experience was not exactly what I imagined it to be.  For instance, the chair situation? A, B, C, etc. So the "highly mobile" chairs in front of the really long table you can share with a large group of people are just pleather office chairs that they placed in the movie theater. The couple chairs that are not mobile are the sofa seats that I wish were mobile, as in having the ability to prop the seat back.  The whole food service system was more distracting than I thought it would be. All throughout the previews and about 30 min into the movie, there are many waiters just going back and forth right in front of you to take people's orders or bring them food. Soo.. that means, you can't see what's going on on the screen, you can't hear what's going on, and you can't focus for several seconds every several minutes for a total of 45 minutes.  The food was meh. The service was mixed. Our initial waiter was very friendly. But we wait for our food to come out, and ours is pretty much one of the last to arrive even though we ordered it before the previews started playing. My friend and I ordered popcorn as an appetizer but after our entree appeared first, we had to ask where our appetizer was and then the waiter simply dumped this whole thing of popcorn onto our small tables, expecting us to just deal with it, and scurried away.

This place is pretty great. There was only one car already in the wash in front of me. I drove up, paid $8 for the basic wash. The only awkward part is having people kind of in your face as you sit there. But it was really quick, and I liked having the ability to vacuum my own car and get every nook and cranny.

I've been to Postino Central (in Phoenix) and Postino Annex (in Tempe), so this was the third Postino location I visited.  The quality of the food was the same, but compared with the other Postino locations, I would say that this location was more dimly lit and the servers were younger. It felt more loud. There is more inside seating.  So far, I liked Postino Central the best because it was more quiet, and the patrons were older and thus, more calm. But this location has a lot more spaces to park your car and there are a lot of cool shops nearby that you can explore on foot.  Ten friends and I got a table near the entrance around 7pm on a Wednesday night. The place was completely full, and it was extremely noisy - I could barely hear the person in front of me.  I would probably come here when it's less packed and during the day time and probably with fewer friends.

[This is a review for the Intro the Handguns Course for 2 Groupon]  So I bought this groupon [$89] (found here: https://www.groupon.com/deals/c2-tactical), which gives you a presentation by an employee about handgun safety for 1.5-2hrs and you practice shooting for ~1hr. You also get a free grey shirt with C2 Tactical on the front (it's aiit). You have to purchase the ammo, however (ammo for two people came out to ~$30).   The safety portion of the handgun course was grueling, but I understand that it's necessary. It's the very first course that you take in a list of courses offered on handguns, so a lot of the presentation was concerning how to pick up and set down the gun and what to be aware of, etc. etc. The workers were friendly and knowledgeable.  During the shooting portion of the course, the instructor told me how to correct my stance and hold of the gun so that I would focus my aim better. It was definitely a scary experience because I've never even come close to a gun before, let alone hold one. The instructor guided me on which gun I would work best with and then even let me try another gun of his. I felt that I learned a lot from the course and would recommend it to anyone who has never shot a gun before, like me.

My experience here was great. After eating lunch next door, my friends and I stopped by to grab some frozen yogurt for dessert earlier today. There were so many flavors - cinnamon bun, pumpkin, watermelon, oreos, peanut butter, salted caramel popcorn, cake batter, vanilla, chocolate, etc. There were also so many toppings to choose from - the most I've ever seen at any frozen yogurt joint - so I was impressed.  There were so many of those popping bubbles; I've only tasted strawberry and mango really, so I was having a great time.  There are three tvs, board games, a lake in the back of the shop. No wi-fi. Seating is pretty decent.

My friend and I came here after reading reviews on yelp, and we're glad we did. Since I'm a NY native, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sushi, which were consistent with what I was used to.  We both had the omakase ($35/person). A lot of pieces for the price. The owner even came to greet us and gave us an extra dish and there was complimentary mochi ice cream afterwards.  The restaurant has many 2-4 people tables; so it's not exactly a place to go to with a large party but it can with a reservation.  I would definitely go eat at Harumi again. The place is clean; it doesn't have much of a cool-looking decor, nothing fancy, but the food and service are quite good.

This was probably the worst experience at a hair salon I have ever had in my entire life. Coming here was a mistake.  I came in the other day and asked for two inches off and long layers because the color was causing split ends. I thought things were going pretty smoothly. Charlie, the person who cut my hair, cut my hair pretty efficiently. I didn't get a blowdry so it was wet, and then I went grocery shopping afterwards.  I get home and I see that there is a clear division in my hair. The layers were not seamless. It was very choppy looking.   I went back to the store to get it fixed. The owner, Adam, cut my hair. Another employee blowdried my hair. None of these actions were performed well. My hair still looks choppy. The blowdry was not a blowdry. Eventually, everyone gave up and the owner offered to give me a free haircut later, which does not resolve the current issue.   Long story short, I will not be going back. No one here knows how to cut hair. They blamed it on how much hair I had and my highlights peeking through that makes my hair look uneven. If my color is the issue, they should have (1) told me beforehand and (2) accommodated to it.   Going back to give them a second chance was a mistake.

Great place to stay in Tempe - very cute and newly renovated, so everything is new and clean. Right across the street from Arizona State U. There's also a free shuttle from the hotel to the airport.  The Normal is a cafe attached to the hotel, and it offers delicious food at reasonable prices.  I loved the bright colors and artwork in the room when I stayed. I also had a balcony with two chairs that overlooked ASU campus.

I came here with a friend on Monday evening. It was around 6pm, but it wasn't too packed so we were able to get a seat pretty easily.  I liked how it wasn't noisy - I was able to hear my friend without having to speak above my normal voice. Our server was friendly and checked up on us a couple times but not annoyingly often.   We ordered the pear salsa and chips. This was okay. I didn't taste any pear or see pear and the chips were just regular chips you get at a grocery store. It was pretty spicy though, so I would be careful ordering this if you can't handle spicy foods.  I ordered the Perfectly Grilled Cheese [$9] with the tomato basil soup instead of the fries because I like dipping grilled cheese into tomato soup. I thought the sandwich was great, really yummy. The portion was perfect for me too. The bread i

DIY pizza for $7.95. Amazing!! I came with my mom and we split one pie, which was the perfect amount of food for the both of us. There are so many topics to choose from, it doesn't take long to create your pizza and have it cooked, and the end result is delicious. 10/10 - would come back anytime!

I came here for lunch today with a few of my friends. The menu is pretty simple, and you order at the counter and the servers will come find you.   I ordered the thigh & drumstick combo [$9] - comes with one sauce (either on the side or tossed with your chicken), a side, and a regular donut. I asked if I could get two sauces, and the cashier said I could, but I wish he told me it would cost $1 extra. Also, since I ordered a premium donut (Lemon Basil, white choc. donut), I had to pay $0.70 more. So the total with tax was abt $12.70.   We sat outside, and since it had just rained the other day, the wind felt so nice. But yes, shooing away the pigeons was a tad annoying.  Our meals arrived about ~30min after we ordered. The sauces were more tangy than what I would have expected as well (aka they weren't that good). The chicken was lightly battered and crispy though and so moist! The donut was really delicious :0 there was a hint of basil flavor that wasn't overpowering. My friend got a chocolate, pistachio with rose flavored donut that was pretty good too.   -1 star for slightly pricey foods (for the amount you get) and sauces that aren't that great +4 stars for super moist chicken, their own parking lot, outdoor covered seating, unique donut flavors

This review is only for the coffee & atmosphere - I have yet to try their food.  I love coming to this place to study/do work. I usually go to Starbucks, but I hate when I come out reeking of coffee. Peixoto provides a pleasant atmosphere in which I can comfortably sip a gourmet latte and the noise level isn't too high. I usually sit near the window - there are plenty of outlets.   One inconvenient factor is the bathroom that's out in the hallway, shared by multiple restaurants and the fact that it's not open late at night. But other than that, I really like this coffeeshop.

Not as good as I thought it would be. My friends and I came here at 7pm on a Saturday night and it was totally empty except for a one family.  I ordered the red bean milk tea without boba [~$4 with tax], and it was basically milk tea with red bean floating around at the bottom. My friend ordered strawberry milk tea with red bean topping, and her tea tasted the same as mine except for a hint of something sweet. It didn't exactly taste like strawberry. I tried the strawberry slush as well and it just tasted like something sweet/tart, but not very good.   Everything else was fine; the decor and service, etc. But the drinks didn't taste like other boba teas that I've had and like to drink.

I stopped by this shop for the first time on First Friday. There was a crowd in there, but I made my way through and what initially caught my attention were these cute little succulents in magnetic pots stuck on all of the pipes lining the shop (only $7). I'd been looking for a friend to share my apartment with, so I made a mental note of those cuties.  There were terrariums and an assortment of different plants of various sizes. Awesome plant related prints as well, which would be perfect to put up on any wall.  The location of the shop is pretty neat too, since it's part of a larger space, leading to an art gallery and cafe.  I ended up buying the potted plant, and it is currently stuck on the lamp stand in my room.

Came here with two friends on a Wednesday night. It was around 6pm so we were the only ones there as Cafe Agit is more lively later in the evening.   The restaurant is clean and spacious. Somber korean love ballads play in the background. The furniture and walls are all black colored. It's a good place to go with a group of up to four people. There's a private seating area with a table that could seat up to ~10 people (with only a piece of cloth as a divider).  It was nice to enjoy our meal in quiet, but because it was so early in the evening, there was only one chef and one waiter working and the food took a while to come out.  When it did finally come out, the dishes were delicious. We ordered the "Podakk" (chicken pieces that are breaded and deep fried and covered in a savory sauce with chives on top), udon, and chicken katsu (comes with salad). Each were delicious, and the quantity was enough to more than satisfy three girls' stomachs.  I would definitely come here again to try the chicken wings and other menu items.

As a yelp judge for this event, I had an okay experience because I was sampling for free and was sometimes given the chance to cut the long lines to sample. Also, having not attended any yelp elite related events, I had minimal to zero expectations.  However, if I was not a yelp elite and had decided to attend the event and purchase a food pass, I would have been so upset.   First of all, the sizes of the food samples were extremely tiny - oftentimes the size of my two thumbs. The price of the food definitely did not justify the quantity that customers were given. For the "Foodie Pass" tasting option, $28 gives you 10 tickets - that's an average of $2.80 I could have paid and actually what others were paying for very small portions.   An hour after the festival had begun, vendors were beginning to run out of samples and even dishes and cups to put the samples in.  Furthermore, there was supposed to be three lines at each vendor, to differentiate between people getting samples, actual food, or express, but more often than not, there was just one long line. That was really silly.  I think the lack of communication amongst the event organizers, volunteer staff, vendors, and festival goers was a big issue. So, with the judging, yelpers weren't informed about where to meet initially, that we would be taped, and that even though the event organizer told us to cut the line, some vendors wouldn't let us do so. The event website was definitely misleading.  Overall, it was a bit of a mess.
