One of the worst experiences I have had in a long time.  I eat out a bunch I  consider myself a foodie.  I know my way around a restaurant and a bar.  I never ask anyone for favors! 45 minutes after I ordered my to go order it arrived only after I asked the bar tender to check on it. Tonight not only did the bar tender not care enough but the the supposed manager who came out of the kitchen had nothing to offer but apologies. Outback once had a great concept great food and good service, no more I recommend you stay away!

Phoenix is fortunate to have several great independent book stores, but at the top of my list is Guidon Books!  Family owned for over 30 years, Guidon Books has the most extensive selection of books about western history I have ever come across .   The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and went out of their way to help me!   The book store itself has everything you would want to read. They have books about outlaws, buffalo soldiers and women of the West.  Plus books about great leaders like Lincoln, Custer and Sitting Bull. Their civil war section is one of the most extensive I have ever seen.  No greater gift then buying a book that someone can enjoy for a life time!

I had another fantastic meal at Durant's on Tuesday!  For me, Durant's the best steak house in Phoenix maybe in the South West! Excellent food and fantastic service, can't wait to go back!

Still the best Sushi in town!  If you have a question just ask for a recommendation from the staff.

This is a great Italian sandwich shop, I had The Bastardo and added some of the fresh anchovies on the side which are delicious!

Monday I went to Super L Ranchmart COFCO center on 44th st, my thought was that I would buy some salmon and fresh produce for dinner.  I had not been to this store for about 4 years until today.    I have to begin by just saying that the service was awful, not once did anyone greet me or ask to help me.  The employees act as if they don't want to be there and that they are going out of their way. I also felt like the store was dirty and neglected.  I was so disappointed in the produce section.  There was a limited supply of produce and the shelves were messing and unkept, I picked out some mushrooms but after looking them over they appeared old and tired. The entire store looked very neglected as if no one really cares about it.  I then went to the fish market and waited with about 11 other people for help with my fish selection.  There were two employees, neither acted like they wanted to be there.  No one waiting was ever greeted or treated with much respect, no one stopped and apologized for the long wait.   Again the selection was meager, the salmon looked a day or two old and had a dull coloration. The fresh fish looked very unappetizing to me.  I thought about some fresh crab or lobster but the tank looked dirty and neglected too.  After waiting for about 10 minutes, I turned around and left the store.  There are many choices in the Valley for fresh sea food. I won't be back to that store at least not any time soon.

True Foods is one of my favorite places to eat and drink!  Great food and fantastic service.  The bar is the best place to sit, always crowded and fun to chat with the bar tenders and the patrons sitting around me.

Scottsdale is fortunate to have a restaurant that cares so much about getting it right! Another great experience sitting at the bar!

Went to Joyride Taco House for the first time last night for Taco Tuesday! Took a seat at the bar which is always my first seating preference.  The bar tender offered up a recommendation which I went with.  Had 3 tacos; carne asada, pork adabado and Baja crispy fish, plus a heaping bowl of guacamole garnished with slices of fresh Serrano chilies.  My friend had four tacos which included an extra carne asada!  Excellent bar and although the bar tenders were busy they took the time to chat with us which made us feel very welcome but most importantly the G&Ts were well made.  We Got there around 5 pm, there was already a nice crowd with positive energy.  I really liked the food here, great flavor and good variety.  Give it a try and let me know what you think!

Fountain Hills, a destination community for cyclist and triathletes, is now home to one of the top bike shops in the Valley.  McDowell Mountain Cycles has an excellent selection of bikes and accessories and friendly knowledgeable staff that lives and breaths bikes.  Jake went out of his way to help me select my new Spark 930, we then did a bike fit in the shop and he followed up by going out on ride with me to ensure that it fit properly, it was the best bike buying experience I have ever had.  When I go in the shop I feel like they love my bike as much as I do!  The staff is passionate about the sport and will chat with you about everything " bike" related. They also have a nice lounge area to watch cycling races and chat with other cyclist. I just recently had my road bike tune up and the bike rides better then it did all summer.  Regardless of what part of town you live in, it's worth your time to visit MMC! Plus Fountain Hills has awesome bike lanes, trails and lots of cyclist train in the area.

Not a very impressive place.  I can over look the dingy old tired look of the place, the strange smell! The film on the beer glass! But I can't over look the rude bar tender and how unacommadative she was about putting an NFL game on, especially the home team.  Plus the televisions are out of focus and no matter where you sit there isn't a good viewing location.  There are better bars for drinks eats and fun, I'd recommend Angels Trumpet House, Corduroy's or even Durants! All within walking distance!
