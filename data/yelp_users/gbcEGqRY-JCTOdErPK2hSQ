I'm a fajita guy. A good fajita with awesome tortillas is all that's needed to please me. They make the tortillas 50%. They are pre-baked from a local bakery and cooked to order afterwards. The food took 30 minutes to come but I forgave them after I took my first bite.   The beans, guac, rice, and most importantly, veggies and steak tasted amazing. I would highly recommend coming here for lunch. It's priced well and made fresh. Can't beat it. Even better when you have a cute date.

First, I want to apologize for not coming here first. We went to Shinbay and we were denied service as the entire restaurant was empty. We were told every seta and table was reserved. When my guests and I arrived at Roka Akor, your hostess made sure she got us seated promptly. We sat in front of the chefs and enjoyed the scenery of cooking right before our eyes.   The atmosphere, the service, and most importantly, the food, was all outstanding. The friends I was with enjoyed everything and raved even after we had left. Keep doing what you're doing, we will definitely be back. :)  Thanks.

I just want to say thank you for denying us service at 6pm when it was completely dead inside your restaurant and telling my guests and I everything was reserved. We ended up at Roka Akor which seemed like a better environment anyways when we walked in, and the food was incredible.  Here's the ironic part, we went to you first because you had the highest rating on Yelp. Sucks to shoot yourself in the foot, aye? If I could give zero stars for customer service, I would. Good luck :)

I was worried at first because there was no host to greet me, but the food and service quickly changed that.   Devon was polite, and held a great conversation. It was a slower dinner, but the environment still felt great. I started with the bruschetta special which tasted fantastic. The sauce and food itself was fresh, which I am very picky about.   I had the rabbit entree' which surprised me. The rabbit was tender, and the pasta is made in house and I could tell. The portion was plentiful and I felt like I got my money's worth.   It's definitely a place you can bring a date or guests to and enjoy good food in a nice environment. I would have given 5 stars but the music confused me, (Italian restaurant playing Hawaiian music at dinner time???) and I found a bone in my rabbit which I was told is common when eating rabbit.   Side note, for the first time eating rabbit, it was extremely delicious. Kudos to the chef.   Overall, this place was good. It's a little pricier than surrounding restaurants, (expect to spend between $60-100 for two people) but worth it. Enjoy.

I have been serviced by D'Lisa, Taylor, and Lydia at this location for over a year now. The place is always clean, friendly and fun. As a photographer, I appreciate the support of local artists, as the salon rotates local artists artwork on their walls which is super cool. Lydia is a great hair stylist and always makes me look my best. She always has a smile on her face and is great to chat with. This place just has a positive vibe to it and I always look forward to my next appointment. You should check this place out if you're looking for a new stylist or any service really, lots of talented people here.
