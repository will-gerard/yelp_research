Very good food but very poor service. Not the first time we have had poor service here. This time, it was the worst service we have ever had. We had a table of 5 people starting around 5 PM for a birthday celebration and the restaurant was not busy.  I'm assuming that the server Alysha P, was having a bad day. She was very short and almost rude to each in the group. We had to ask her multiple time for more cocktails, water and such. We even waited for a couple of minutes to get silverware napkins and condiments after our food was brought to the table. Nothing was a priority to her. Four of us are self-employed business owners and the 5th person is a restaurant manager. None of us could believe that management has re-trained her or let her on her way out the door.  Hopefully better luck nex time.

They have some of the best food around town. Great variety of food and drinks. We are they at least once a week. The service is reason number we go there. Ask for Dalice when you go in there, she is simply amazing! Job well done.
