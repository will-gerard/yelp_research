This is a wonderful establishment, and easily the best Japanese fast food restaurant in our city. My review isn't even necessary, as I think the Blue Fin can speak for itself, 99% of the people that come here will leave satisfied. I've found that small dedicated local busineses like this usually engender nothing but respect and praise from their community; but every once in a while you'll get a certain someone who for whatever reason is going to go on the record publicly and trash a place that is beloved by the majority. I wasnt even going to write this review until I saw the egregious 1 star rant that this type of person wrote previously. So, rather than a review proper, this is more of a review coupled with a response to that baffling 1 star atrocity below.  If your the type of person who will shell out 1 and 2 star reviews to mom and pops earnestly trying to serve their community and build a sustainable business, but give 5 star reviews to places like el pollo loco and ross; than please dont come here. you'd be better off in your $15 elastic waste band pants eating greasy chicken in your honda pilot. post script: SEA WEED SALAD IS KING HERE!

Cheuvront is definitely a 1st date night kinda place; the kind of place I would normally never go to but pretend to be very familiar with when trying to woo a lady.  It's quiet, unrushed, dimly lit, and a tad on the expensive side. The eats are tasty, the wines are bold and the service is on par.

It was a scorcher. Certainly one of our famous triple digit days, and as I sat in the passenger seat, bumming a ride from mi amigo, Vicente, I couldnt shake my contempt for his leather seats.  We drove down Roosevelt in the Garfield district towards Ranch Market, on the way discussing the Alwun house, Rito's, and some colourful housing that we both agreed leant to the overall gentrification of the neighborhood.  The grounds of this place are sprawling, palatial in fact. I was completely ripped and had on a pair of imitation wayfarers that had a broken arm and kept sliding off my face with the least possible movement of my head.   Endeavoring not to break them further I held my head at rigid attention my back was grammar school like in posture. I then realized how arrogant and white I must've looked, in my mind I fantasized I was a conquistador with a local Toltec guide showing me the ins and outs of the Aztec village we were entering, then I kinda got sick of that phantasy and pictured myself as a balmy Harrison Ford intrepidly following Albert Molina through an alternate ruinous Mayan temple, all the while expecting danger and betrayal at every corner.  I probably looked half insane as some of the patrons looked at me oddly, giving me a wide birth. Entering the place it's just as big inside. It's like costco and food city had a wild passionate tequila filled tryst and gave birth to the Eva Longoria of grocery stores.  Vicente and I immediately split up, probably not the best of ideas, but I wanted to explore and he was eager to do the same. I quickly snatched up the worst shopping cart in the store (you know the one with a bad front wheel and sticky grip) and let my stomach guide me.  Two gallons of horchata. check. Exotic mozzarella style cheese from Oaxaca and  some delicious salty Cotija. check. A lb. of plantains. check. Mango's, apples, dried pinto beans, sugar snap peas, string beans, potato's, roma tomato's- check!   Grocery shopping while intoxicated can get a little quixotic, and confusing to say the least. I hadnt the slightest clue what I was going to make, but the colors of the produce were certainly alluring.  Finally Vicente caught up with me and laughed gutturally upon seeing my hodge podge of a shopping cart. I stared thru him with glazed eyes as I espied the "cafeteria". I abandoned my shopping cart and slowly walked over, intriguiged, literally beguiled by the aroma of cooked meats.   I hadnt the slightest clue what most of it was, and what broken Spanish I know certainly wasnt helping with most of the dishes behind the glass, until bingo; Carnitas.  There was a word I knew and loved, I stared at the "meat" not quite convinced I knew what I was looking at. Sure it said carnitas, but this was...well...it resembled a tamarind bean, but was much longer, and had a color ruddy and blackish, certainly most unappealing. The tube like meat sat coiled amongst itself like tentacles in a brackish water. I stared at it hypnotized, until a young Mexican attendant came to take my order.   "Hey man what you want?" he asked, breaking the glamour that held me entranced.  "...a half a pound of this..." I said unsteadily. He looked at me almost impressed, and half cautiously. As he deflty grasped a pair of tongs and started sloshing the meat back and forth in it's brackish juices, attempting a better grip, it looked more alien to me than ever. I was beginning to come to my senses out of a stupor, and it was slowly dawning on me what this was.  In a slightly horrified and hoarse whisper I leaned over the counter and looked him in the eyes and asked, "Wait, wait......what is this...stuff!?"  Then he said, grinning a knowing, mocking grin, "Yoo don' know whad tis is and yoo wanna poun' of eet man?"   Just then Vicente strolled up casually behind me and saw what I was doing, the two exchanged a brief chuckle as apparently Vin had overheard the attendant's query.  "Trrrriiipa!" Vicente exclaimed, using his dormant mexican accent that usually only comes out when drunk or speaking with his parents, to which the attendant grinned and nodded enthusiatically.  Aghast, I stepped back in revulsion, I'd nearly ordered a pound of pigs intestines.I felt profoundly embarassed, never more had I shown off the "pinche gringo" side of my personality than in that moment.   I ended up just ordering some pork ribs that'd been marinated in a chile sauce, along with the ubiquitous spanish rice and refried beans.  I love ranch market, but I'm certainly not going back until the raspberry of embarassment lightens.

The G&D is ab fab!  Came in on a sunday afternoon, and it was deserted save for the brit publican who in his charming way that only a bloke from across the pond could muster guessed by our appearances just which brews we would favor; to my brother an ice cold pint of Newcastle, and to me a frosty Kronenbourg. After a few pints were knocked back we hit the billiards at a mere .50 cents a game. Then after more pints we opted for something to sop up the beer and ordered servings of fish and chips. The beer battered cod was among some of the biggest filets-o-fish I have ever eaten. Delicious and meaty the succulent white fish and fat thumb sized chippies were the ideal order after several pints of beer, and after all was over and done with, my tab was under $30. I loved the place and will probably jump off the lightrail for a quick pint and a pool game any time I'm riding up central.

Slippery Pig is my favorite bike shop. I come here pretty frequently for new tubes. Every couple months, after a valve breaks or a particularly nasty thorn penetrates my tire I know it's time to head down to the pig.  I love this shop in particular because of several reasons which I will in turn explain below:  -Location; centrally located along the light rail, it's super convenient for folks like me, who, once their bike has gone out of commission need an alternate means of transport. It's literally across the street from a light rail stop. Also it's right next door to Lux and Panne Bianco, so while your bike is getting some fine tuning you can go grab a delicious panini and chill outside in the fairer weather or lounge inside Lux with the hip kids sipping inky coffee to music from before their time.   -Customer Service; a lot of bike shops can be like mechanics garages, filled with gear heads that toss around jargon and tools with grease covered hands, intimidating and emasculating you about your lack of knowlege and inadequacy as a cyclist. Not at Slippery Pig, these dudes know their stuff and they're more than willing to share that wisdom. They aren't condescending and they're super helpful. It's also a family/doggy friendly shop.  -Price; If you're shopping for a new bike this might not be the cheapest spot. However if you're after parts or need some repairs the dudes at the S.P. won't charge you an arm and a leg...or a belly and a loin.  I'd gladly recommend anybody here and as far as I'm concerned this is the best bike shop in Cen_Pho.

Ahh what a great place to watch, hear, and feel some live music. The Rhythm Room has an "electric feel" to it! It is a great spot for the blues, some really talented blues acts pass thru here on a regular basis. I would say the best time i had here was a few months back when The AppleSeed Cast played, in it's entirety, Low Level Owl vol. I&II. OMFG what a great intimate space to hear such sprawling ear drum shattering prog rock! My face was melted. The Rhythm Room's layout is a little akward for sure, what with that stomach level pony wall that segregates the crowd, it's such a bitch getting stuck behind that thing. Assumably it's to divide up the 21 on under crowds but i wouldnt know, maybe when it was designed in the early 70's or whenever these sort of 1/4 walls were all the rage, personally i'd just as soon knock it down and open up the space. meh no big. If you are a music fan, and enjoy cheap stiff drinks, i'd say this is one of the many great venues in phx that can provide both in heavy doses.

PCG cannot fail to please. i have been twice now, once for a yelp event and once to use the coupon they gave me at said yelp event. Both times i was blown away by the delicious food i had here.  The follow up visit i brought my best friend, the lovely Barbara G and we had an excellent time! The service is great, and i am especially fond of the waiter who took care of me both visits, gosh i wish i could remember his name...but without sounding...a little...too...glaad...not that there's anything wrong with that! he was a very handsome man....but i was genuinely impressed that he remembered me from the yelp event, and both visits his serving skillz were right on par. kudos!  when we sat down and perused the menu I was still a little "dazed and confused" from my morning rituals *ahem* and everything on the menu sounded ridiculously good to me, it was getting so hard to make up my mind, i was floundering until my lovely friend Barbara suggested the bacon bleu cheese burger, a girl after my own heart! We then both ordered said burger, a coke for her and a pabst for myself. We gnoshed on those delicious burgers accompanied w/ garlic horseradish mashed potatoes ooooweee! Here was a dish that was so perfectly flavoured and well thought out and deceptively simple. without a shadow of doubt one of the best burgers i've had in phx. I would recommend PCG to any and all, and look forward to when i make my return.

unlike Amy D. I have not had every carrier you can think of, ONLY Cricket, and now, a two year binding indentured servant contract thru TMobile. Let's start off with the store: was it built on top of an indian burial ground? is there a sewer main that has broken? Is their septic tank backed up? do their employees shower in sulfur springs? what is up with that stank in this place!? I've been here twice now and each time it reeked of rotten eggs. It was so bad that the first time I came here, my friends waited for me outside! T-Mobile for me, is synonomous with shoddy service, I can never get a signal! Whether it's in my own bathroom, the 4th floor of the office building I work in, or sitting in class.  My calls are constantly dropped as well. I will be mid sentence before I realize there isnt anyone on the other end and I've been talking to dead air.  Prittaay. Prittaay. Frustrating. [rickety] Cricket gets a lot of [roberta] Flak for their ghetto-ish-ness (see what I did there?) but I will take them anyday, I remember the good ol' days when I'd ride my bike down to mill and sit at the Cricket store amongst the other lost souls, as I waited to pay my $40 bill, It was a hairs breadth away from waiting in line at DES or the DMV, crying babies, rapidly spoken spanish chattering from all corners, an apathetic and overweight security guard by the door, dirty chairs, stained carpet, a snoozy black dude falling asleep next to me practically on my shoulder Ahhh the good ol days of Cricket. not anymore Now T-mobile and the unintelligible phillipine call centers rule my cell phone usage, with their expensive payments, my crappy phone, their shoddy service, it's enough to push a man into becoming like Michael Douglas's character in "Falling Down" ... and to add insult to injury they dont even have Catherine Zeta-Jones as their spokeswoman anymore: ummm WTF just because she was in Entrapment? c'mon it wasnt Sean Connery's best but it wasnt her worst! dont hold Entrapment against her! bring back Catherine ZJ you morose motherfuckers! cannot wait 'till that 2 year contract is up!

In the wake of the CMYE@PCG there formed a rebel band of Yelp mercenaries on the hunt for karaoke: there was the leader, Tiffany B, with an enchanted blackberry map fueled by starlight and charisma she pooled together her powers of navigation and tied her curly locks back in anticipation of the voyage to come. There was her first Lt. Dante M with a fearlessness that bordered on the reckless, his was a stalwart courage feuled mostly by alcohol and brazen contempt for authority. There were the Brothers C, Ryan and Daren, two exemplary soldiers of fortune whose fame/infamy had become a thing of legend. There was Dolores G, the champion and primary breadwinner of the ensemble.  There was Chris B, a beserker, tenor, and master crafstman. And finally there was Robert O, perhaps the most enigmatic and mysterious figure of the group he stood on the precipice of reality and greatness. Some would deem him a young Hemmingway, or a more talented Ryan Seacrest- at any rate his presence lent creedence and semblance to a group whose sole purpose was to butcher pop songs at the seediest bar they could find. Their journey first took them down the long and winding paths of 16th st, to a charming but treachorous haven of filth that belonged to Phil, upon arrival it was evident their Karaoke treasures were not to be found here. Onward their travels took them to their final destination- Pat Murpheys house of sin/shame on 32nd st and Thomas. The drinks flowed, the songs were sung, Hearts were broken microphones were dropped, and Cowboy was on the top of his game (a sagacious old fool whose coolness rivaled the marlboro man) spinning his cowboy hat in the parking lot like a whirling dervish. cowboy had a wisdom and charm that is unmatched. As the night dragged on and the songs became more desperate, I found my drunk to be wavering and my wallet to be in want of funds, i said my goodbyes and took my leave of the company and wandered into the night whence i'd came.

All the debate on Chinese food in the valley gets tiring. Sure we may not have the options some bigger more culturally astute metropolis' offer, but we have a plethora of little spots like this, sequestered away in the seas of stripmalls that dominate the vast swathes of phoenix's urban sprawl.  I came here on Xmas day with my brother, sister, mother and sister-in-law and I would say we were all pleasantly surprised. Little Peking is your standard American style Chinese fare, you'll see all the usual suspects; almond chicken, kung pao, lo mein, moo goo gai pan, sweet and sour, twice cooked, well you get the picture. Despite the lack of "authenticity" (and I say that in quotes because who the hell am I, a white dude, to question whether or not a dish made by some one of Chinese descent is authentic) everything we ordered was darn good. Not overly greasy, the fried items being lightly breaded with only white meat used; I genuinely liked Little Peking's version of twice cooked chicken more than the Chinese delivery place I regularly order from in my hood. Whats more is that their lunch menu was insanely cheap, we paid about $20 for a party of four.  Little Peking is a solid option for those in the area, give them a shot.

although not my personal favorite i cannot think of one single complaint that could be garnered from this fine airport, they have always left me satisfied, except when i am touching down on my return flight. ranked no. 5 in business insider magazines top ten airports in the us list,  http://www.businessinsider.com/the-10-best-airports-in-america-2010-2#no-7-portland-or-international-pdx-4  its always sunny in phoenix's own sky harbor airport is one landmark we phoenicians need to be proud of and not deride. thanks sky harbor, for all the magical flights you've sent me away to, promptly and without hassel....hoff.

Such a fat kid they know my name. I come here saturday mornings, looking like death warmed over seeking the warm and reassuring sustenance of their delicious fare. Their Carnitas are a favorite of mine, the Machaca is succulent and moist, the confections are glorious and stand out amongst the various panaderias Phoenix has to chose from, even my tiny little 89 yr old spanish grandmother loves them, and she is one tough galleta to please. Azteca is one of my favorite places to bring my family for a quick breakfast, since they all love it and it's easy on the wallet. So many memories I have of this joint I just love it and hope someday when I have a little snot nosed brat to tote around I can bring him here and shut him up with some pan dulce. Viva Azteca!

This place is unassuming from the outside, and it's very possible to miss if your not used to the area. i probably drove by it hundreds of times to and fro from MCC and never even considered going here until a local and fellow class mate gave me the heads up. So i step inside fully prepared to be underwhelmed and greeted by goths or pretentious metal brats in black and im immediatley smitten: the loads and loads of rock' n' roll parephenalia and musical ephemera of almost every conceivable genre! The sea of posters kept me occupied for an hour and a half! I was so OVERwhelmed that i vowed to come back with a gameplan in mind. I ended up finding a really cool mini poster of a stevie wonder concert and a giant poster of a sonic youth tour in the NW. So much cool stuff it'd be a shame not to give them a looksee. plus there are ample restaurants in the area so if you get weary you can replenish yourself and head back and continue your search. happy hunting!

Oy Vey! this place has the best bagel sandwiches, i mean..thats what they do, that is their modus operandi: perfecting the art of the bagel sandwich. The first time i came here i had this amazing spicy jalapeno concoction on a crispy bagel lathered w/ smoked turkey and sprouts i think, cream cheese was def. involved. then i came back and it was nowhere on the menu! i was so disappointed, bring whatever that delicious sandwich was back and another star is in order. Simply a great choice for breakfast and coffee.

I LOVE PV! The nature of this bar can appropriatley be summed up in one word, this word has been thrown around describing the pv lounge far more than any other as far as im concerned: dive. yes and if that frightens you, or that isnt something that draws you like a moth to a flame...or a wino to a dive bar, then for heavens sakes piss off and dont come here!  For the rest of us that like our beers and pool cheap, our tunes on the loud and punkish side, and our bars divey then you'll love the palo verde lounge. everytime i have been here i see something worthwile: a fight between two hobos on the way there, punk bands from denver too drunk to properly play, vampish girlies that'll steal your soul at pool with a sly wink, and kids smokin chiba from a beer can in the back alley. It never fails to disappoint!  on the decor: It's about as big as my apartment insid, the bathroom is about as equally disgusting as any hovel i have ever been to. There really isnt much room when there is a good band playing here- but who cares? Go rub elbows with your barmates and make acquaintances! Patrons are usually really cool and talkative, every time I have been there is someone interesting to chat up. The PV is just one of the best little bars in the area, and its on the way to and fro from Yucca or Time Out, so stop by for a drink on your ride home.

Tony's is perhaps my favorite bar in Glendale. They offer a decent selection of craft brews and have great deals on pitchers and domestics. The bar tenders have a heavy pour. There are numerous televisions for sports fans. Darts shuffle board, and pool tables. Dimly lit interior and plenty of seating. The crowd here is usually a mixed bag, but never have I encountered any overt assholery. Do yourself a favor and grab a white russian here sometime and watch the ball game.

I love this place!  I used to come here every day on my lunch break in highschool back when my pallette was a wee bit unrefined, since then i have grown up a bit and realize that there is more to asian cuisine than rice bowls but thats not what this place is about, nor would i hold it against them Island Teriyaki is a place where you can grab a tasty quick bite to eat for around $5 or so, everything is simple, to the point and delicious and for that, it draws hungry west side fans from all around you'd be hardpressed to find a better lunch option in the area personal favorite: the japanese style curry w/ brwn rice mmmm xtra* for the beautiful girls they have behind the counter ^___^

Thrifty Joe's is a cool little place; hidden in the back corner of a strip mall, near a big mega church and a steinmart i believe. This place is just a little nook of used books, cd's, games (vintage and newer: see their N-64 selection, pretty nice), vinyl, and some other odd little knick knacks. I dig this place mostly on nostalgia. haven't been there in years but in Highschool i used to sell my books for pocket change and herb$$ and they'd almost always take most of my stuff. i love their selection of vinyl, while granted its not along the lines of zia or something; but i bought  E.L.P's 1st album (Tarkus) and a copy of a Neil Diamonds greatest hits collection all for under $5 and they were practically mint! The classical book selection is great as well, there are a crap ton of quality authors from Camus to Emile Zola you can bet on finding a nice hardback for relatively cheap.  Love ya TJ dont ever change!

What can I say about Bikini, writing a review for a place I love so much, all of my words fail me. "Words words words". It's like asking me to write a review about my brother, I love him and know his faults and strengths, grown up with him and shared time- it's much easier if you were to just meet him and form your own opinion, 'cause ultimately wherever you fall I'm not gonna change my mind. I am invested. This is my kin. I've spilled blood here, bared my soul, seen god, lived moments in slow motion and known that I was forging something I'd tote around my neck like an albatross. Bikini Lounge is  hallowed ground, it's my TARDIS, it's my Hylian fairy fountain. So many memories lost like tears in rain or rather conversations hazy with alcohol. Nestled in that nexus where Grand, Roosevelt, and 15th Ave converge, a local ley line, an oasis for downtown PHX folken to post up and meet the Gredos of their life that they'll shoot first or the Annie Halls they'll attempt to woo. Inside the confines of this tiki themed cathedral many a drama has unfolded, and never have I left it's warm embrace with regret on the mind. The juke box has beguiled more of my pocket change than any swindler I could ever come across. The booths have born witness to more conversations with my boon companions than I dare say my apartment walls have. The bathroom, oh the bathroom! The worst toilet in Scotland. The pool table, like a wizened ragged old whore with a heart of gold, she isn't even for sale anymore, she gives it away. Holidays are the best times to visit le bikini, holiday family soultions are served there. Milk and honey flow here. I could keep gushing but I think you get the picture. Don't come here, but seriously come here.

instructions on how to properly enjoy a meal at eribertos: step 1. consume vast quantities of alcohol. certainly any spirit will do, however I find that the cheaper the liquor, the better. I prefer 40 oz of a nice malt liquor bagged in paper. step 2.  avoid items like lengua, tripe, or various organ meat. while these may certainly be delicious, they are not a great suggestion for pale patrons, those with IBS, or generally any restaurant with a drive thru window. step 3.  examine your food before consumption. and i cannot stress this enough, often times there are "stow aways" hidden discretly inside the wrappings of a tortilla. these may and have ranged in my experience (though not necessarily at Eribertos) from pieces of metal, bandaids, hair, hang nails, to the dreaded and unexpected forms of human excrement. step 4. leave the contents of your order inside you take away bag. consuming your food inside your vehicle is akin to texting while driving, and is not only dangerous to yourself but others. if you must eat in your car, please do so while parked. a word of caution: consuming eribertos inside ones vehicle can and will leave a stench that permeates the interior for days to weeks. step 5. procure yourself in advance some form of antacid or beano, if not properly followed vicious gas may wreak havoc on your stomach for the ensuing several hours of digestion.

Thirsty on thursday, with a wad of cash in my pocket, and indebted to my brother for several rounds of drinks he bought me earlier in the week we set off on our bikes down 3rd ave. on a righteous quest that could rival Bill and Ted's any day. Riding along my neighborhood in the pleasant evening air, I knew my destination well in advance.  "where are we going man??" asks my Sancho Panza-esque little brother. "To a land of giants weilding wooden lances, and green felt tables, where ivory like orbs are ricocheted against one another, and ales flow from spigates for mere pence on the dollar. We go my dear boy to a house that is hidden. aye. a hidden house" "what the hell are you talking about man!?" "onward rocinante!" i said as i pedaled my fixed gear with all the might my legs could muster. shrugging his shoulders my younger brother kept up the pace on his tank like classic cruiser. As we approached Osborn we wound our way to the Hidden House's parking lot and whipped our steeds over to the bicycle lockup. The outside trappings didnt show much promise, and my doubts started to arise within me. Justin was quite aloof to this however, and locked our bikes up promptly and waltzed on in, I followed hesitantly.  The minute we stepped foot inside I felt at ease, the relaxed patrons all sat quite quietly, humbly watching their football games, college and pro. We belly'd up to the bar and I ordered a scotch and soda for myself and a pbr for justin.  Amazedly we stared at the plethora of billiards tables offered to us, and after several rounds of bevvy, and a failed inquiry as to what food they offered (the kitchen is closed until further notice), we made straight away for a rousing game of pool.  We neither of us could best one another so the true test of our mettle at billiards will have to come later. 2 to 2, $1 for four games of pool, is probably the best deal I have ever come across. We left the Hidden House in a blurry stupor, but we left as champions, conquerors of windmills and tins of beer. The ride home not withstanding several scrapes and bruises.

Mi patio do you keep your servers on a strict diet of beatings, verbal intimidation, and benzedrine? because my server was insanely good-so good that it was suspicious... like this gentleman had his A game on, no effing joke, and i noticed he never said one word to us and never really looked us in the eye in a word: servile. we'd be sitting there and he'd be back with fresh refills of our beverages and a non stop, everlasting supply of chips and salsa the second our portions got vaguely low. once we'd barely touched our chips he'd be back with a brand new batch piping hot and crispy. probably amongst the best service i have ever encountered in my short life. Now as far as the food goes, top knotch! knotch has a silent k right? lets assume it does. the food here is deeee lish us! berry berry nice!  and cheap as dirt! i swear mi patio must be running dope on the side their food and drinks are so cheap! how can they afford this!? seriously!? (sheriff joe and your cronies/goons if for some ungodly reason your're reading this the aforementioned comments were complete hyperbole and meant to be taken lightly) Mi patio you are a gem a true gem. great location, great prices, great food, superb service!

Murray's Cocktail Bar, quite possibly became my new favorite dive in North Central Phoenix last Saturday. It's unpretentious, straightforward, and very welcoming. My visit was highly entertaining and a raucously good time. My friend and I were ostensibly the most attractive and youngest people patronizing the bar that night, and that was quite a pleasant change of pace for me lemme tell ya! Some of the other patrons kept buying us cocktails and giving us money for the juke box, it was like we were prom royalty or something, more likely they were ogling my friend and placating me with booze, whatever it worked. There was one man with a thick Vietnamese accent who was noshing on a giant bowl of pop corn that kept chatting my ear off, he was harmless and actually rather interesting, until he said Pho Thanh was the worst Vietnamese restaurant in the valley, that almost ended our newly budding acquaintance. There was another guy, who insisted that he grew the best herb in town, and when I scoffed he offered to prove it to me. I was all too eager to be proven wrong until he said we'd have to go to his house, which was conveniently just around the corner, I politely declined and said my wife inside would kill me! I managed to get back in from the smoking patio to my friend who was being swarmed with offers to dance from several of the dudes playing pool, she demurred for a while but finally gave in and bailando'd to a crooning Enrique. After several rounds of cheap but stiff well drinks poured by the lovely bartender, who's name escapes me unfortunately, we decided to call it a night. I really can't wait to go to Murray's again sometime, it's a funky happenin' little spot in the Slope.

This used to be my favorite place to go as a bored teen growing up on the west side. I think it's a little unfair to say that this location pales in comparison to the Tempe or Chandler locations, as they all have relatively the same merchandise and you can place an order on any of their stuff from different locations. This is probably your best bet for music if you live in glendale or peoria, its got a decent enough collections of vinyl as well. The dvd's and video game selection is better than you'd expect. Also Zia is a great place to buy concert tix. They're usually pretty fair when it comes to selling your cd's or dvds or games, so all you broke teens in desperate need of pocket change come pawn your posessions cause mommy and daddy will probably just buy you a new one anyway

Lenny's is a phoenix staple...unfortunately i cant for the life of me tell why. I hear that it has gone downhill, i hear that it's great, but when i went there it was sheer "meh". For some ungodly reason i thought it would be prudent to get a "teriyaki burger" here and it could only be described as a "Terry?! YUCKY!" burger (assuming the fry cooks name was terry) I took one bite and was overwhelmed w/ nausea and regret; the lettuce was wilted and gray, the cheese was a neon orange plastic tragedy,  the bun- soggy and shiny w/ grease, mayo slathered all over it, the teriyaki sauce tasted like burnt blackened tar, and the sad excuse for a pineapple on top was almost more insulting than the previous offenses. After several bites i figured it just wasnt worth it and covertly threw it away  The actual burger itself probably wasnt too bad, but all the poor quality ingredients that smothered it made it horrible. My parent's burgers were actually very good, they were wise enough to order a simple plain burger: patty & bun. kinda hard to eff up. so word of caution; if going to Lenny's K.I.S.S.  (keep it simple stupid, hurts my feelings everytime)

I have been putting off this review for a long time. Frankly. It has been intimidating to write. I want so badly to appropriately convey just how special this little restaurant is. I suppose there is no other way than to spill out all my blinding earnestness in one fell swoop, casually extolling every virtue this little mom n' pop restaurant offers. "Mi Comida", formerly "mi Cocina mi Pais", is hands down, my favorite restuarant in all of the valley. Located  in the most unassuming strip mall, shadowed neath the coporate monster that is taco bell. Mi Comida is a south american restaurant, offering Peruvian, Colombian, and Ecuadorian dishes- of such quality and sagacious cooking method, you'll feel as if your very own south american grandmother you never knew you had cooked it all for you. The food is so good in fact i'd subsitute it for human relationships any day; this leaves you and your wallet: satisfied, happy, and full.  I couldn't tell you what my favorite dish is, probably the entire menu. Every time i come here it is an adventure. Will it be closed? Will it be jam packed w/ adoring fawning salivating foodies? What will i order this time? Seriously i have ordered a different item each time, and NEVER, repeat NEVER was i disappointed. I have brought my parents here, my brother, my sister, my best friends, and even my ex girlfriend, and all entered a little skeptical and cautious, but left adoring fans. I'm not sure if it is possible to describe accurately how much i love this restaurant; and for the life of me i dont understand why the rating isnt a complete 5 *****! i'd like to sit down and chat w/ some of my Yelp friends and open a real dialogue as to why they only gave it 4 stars....i'm lookin at you Iain B.! lol Whether you live in Chandler, or Tukee. Mesa or PV make the drive out here (not you sun city folk you'll kill someone on the way)! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!

it's high time i reviewed the dirty drummer; or as my associate, buisness partner, and long time Consigliere Jose would call it "the dirty drizzle"  the DD is quite the dive bar, it has everything that you'd expect and little more this place is quite literally the bees knees how many tales i could regale a prosepective yelp reader with concerning this little nook of sudsy heaven but as i've been an extreme blowhard as of late i will keep this pithy: the DD has a grood selection of cheap cheap cheap domestic beers, a pitcher of PBR or COORS or BUD will run you a couple of bucks the food is not your average bar food but is honestly cooked with love, the burgers are amazing, the wings are great, the sandwhiches are tops! The bogs here are always clean, and have names! the mens room is the Elton John, while the ladies is the Olivia Newton John! the pool tables will run you .75 cents a game, the electronic juke box has a plethora of music all rather fitting for the atmosphere and as i've recently found out they have a lot of theme nights here with drink specials and other activities  If i was unfortunate enough to live in mesa i'd drown my sorrows here every day luckily i only work here so i can visit the DD at my conveniece during happy hour after a rough day at the office

Krazy Sub is pretty rad. Similar to goodcents but with a little more charm. They're situated right across the street from my work so it's super convenient, you'll always see a grip of Banner peeps over here come 11-12. The interior of the place reminds me of Ringo's only memorable song, "Octopus Garden"- its got kind of a yellow submarine vibe going on inside with little murals of supermario-esque water level type sea life on the walls. cheap prices for delicious homemade italian american stlye submarine sandwiches. My favorite is the meatball sub: for something like $5 you get about a 1 foot long sub on soft, fresh italian bread, with several delicious meat balls smothered in marinara and garnished with a couple peperoncini's and tomatoes, really the perfect lunch. To top it off they have an old school arcade mortal kombat game here, that i love to feed a quarter while I wait for my sub. (Fuck you Johnny Cage, Raiden for life!!) I'll definately miss this place when my job transfer goes through. Thanks for all the good lunches Krazy Sub!

After the Elite event at Iruna, my Yelp posse; Dante Dolores Anna Mike and I (name drop!!) decided to chase the evening with mas cervezas, at a place Dante lovingly referred to as "The Rusty Trombone". We stumbled to the western theme bar with two birds i'd been chatting up in toe, whose boring names escape me. As we made our approach we could hear a lone singer/guitarist gilr crooning away to Fleetwood Mac and as my mates snickered a smile formed across my lips as I nostalgically thought of my Mum. We settled ourselves at a table and got some drinks, and some more drinks and even more drinks, after that the night was a blur. I recall us all getting rowdy and tipping the singer girl, and after every tip she'd ring a cowbell of some sort and we'd all cheer and holler. really we kept tipping her out of the sheer novelty of the cowbell im assuming...well at least i was. She kept referring to us as virgins, as it was our first time at the "rusty trombone", so as virgins she honored us with a song request- I wasted no time "COCAINE BLUES!!!!" i shouted, to a few mumbled giggles from the regulars- The Grizzled and bad ass bar tender actually sang the lyrics as the guitarist girl played the tune, and in the most stellar karaoke esque rendition of johnny cash he bellowed out the lyrics to a T! as i sang along drunkenly, probably embarrassing my yelp mates and the two boring birds i'd chatted up at Iruna, some regular swayed past me and pawed at my tousled mop of hair. I recall going to the bathroom and returning to find Jimmy the grizzled barkeep adoringly belting out a ballad to the more attractive of boring girls we'd brought along much to her embarassment and horror, at some point they took their boring selves to their boring homes and we kept drinking and forging bonds that could rival the best of Yelp cliques! I will never forget...well what i remember from that night i will never forget...LOL! Thanks to my newest Yelp friends and thanks to the Rusty Trombone for making a great evening that much greater!

sushi is kinda like sex. or chocolate. there are varying levels of quality, but can it really be bad? I think RA is def. meh it's a little spendy it's usually pretty crowded w/ a lame coterie of student/yuppie/douche hybrids. it's sushi is good but like i said, kinda hard to mess up......well....that's probably not true. I am sure if i tried to make sushi i could fuck it up royally bottom line: there are better places, and there are worse. if you like the mill ave crowd then please c'mon down and make it rain!

Ethiopian cuisine at it's best; Cafe Lalibela is the alpha while that other Ethiopian restaurant in Tempe, which shall remain nameless, is the obvious beta.  Every experience i have had here has been first rate. Not once have i been let down or treated poorly; whether i was on my best behaviour mimicking an upright citizen square or fried out of my mind on mushrooms draped in paisley- the lovely ladies at Lalibela serve me luscious mouth-watering ethnic delicacies regardless of my pupil's dilations or contractions. Your first encounter with Ethiopian cuisine could be intimidating for the casual newb, but your curiosity will serve you well! I had no clue what to order when i first came here, so i asked my server and she steered me in the right direction. If i remember correctly, my first time consisted of Doro Wat, collared greens and a heavily spiced wat mixture of cabbage, carrots and onion.  Since, i have tried nearly everything on the menu save the fish wat, whose name escapes me, and every item has been so delictable! You really can't go wrong when you can order a meal for two for under $15 and still have left overs for the both of you.  Cafe Lalibela is a students dream! Cheap prices, exotic flavours, quiet unrushed atmosphere, perfect for a long study/homework session and a grande meal to take the edge off. I love you Lalibela and I only hope we have many more happy years together!

Khai Hoan is another jewel amongst the various Vietnamese eateries we have around the valley, but in my honest opinion it's in the big three. who are the big three, well lets call them the giants of Vietnamese cuisine in the phoenix metro area; they are (in my humble opinion)  ~Pho Thahn ~Pho Avina ~Khai Hoan Why does Khai Hoan make it in the Big3? well, for a number of reasons (most of which have already been rattled off by yelpers far more credible than I) Character: like a Faulkner novel! this little hole in the wall has the heart of a lion, but the trappings of a lamb. It is a tiny joint, cramped and chock full of the knick knacks and bric-a-brac that you could find in any pho shoppe, but, the owner really makes this place his own, and I'm almost sure that anytime I think of Khai Hoan I will picture him, when you've made yourself synonomous with a building, then you've given that place some character. Value: the value here is demonstrated continuously, from their dirt cheap price range, to the heaping portions, to the fresh flavourful ingredients. You can come here with $10 in your pocket and eat like a king. Location: Khai Hoan also slides into the Big3 i.m.h.o. because of the conveniet locale. situated along the light rail corridor, in the same strip mall as the venerable Haji Baba, in lovely Tempe. This couldnt be a more convenient easy place to get to, for me at least. All in all Khai Hoan is simple, tasty, cheap, and easily accesible Vietnamese & Chinese food lovingly made. an interesting foot note: avoid the "salted plum drink" probably the worst thing I have ever drank.

these guys have really stepped up their game a notch back in the day it was subpar really but i ordered a spinach and sausage pizza a few weeks back and it was great, not too much cheese, and good thin crispy crust not many places around the area are open late come 1am you have a choice between various disgusting fast "food" chains, ex$pen$ive $ilver mine $ubs, or these guys, which when you line em up, isnt much of a choice at all good job fella's, now just dont mess it up!

While this place can be very lively and entertaining and it has a great neighborhood/dive vibe going on, it almost always dissappoints me. I want so badly to like this place and make it my home away from casey's however they do their best to make it hard. hard on the atmosphere: 9 times outta ten its dead, no one there and nothing going on hard on the wallet: when something IS actually happenin like some live music or just a good crowd there is always a cover, and they seem to jack up their prices hard on the pallet: no good beer selections. have fun sipping on piss tasting domestics overall i seem to just get alienated from this bar, despite its potential. in my opinion they should shape up or sail out

This place reminds me of Vintage Thrifts back home in the NW, the syles are very retro hip and there is an abundance of really great jackets, boots, and old blue jeans hence the eponymous title of this fine habadashery. The location is also great due to nearby haunts like the Rogue, Green, and Food City. As some one mentioned previously the clerks here are top notch, my first experience at the store i'd ridden my bike across the bridge from Tempe and had just ingested a belly full of green, on my way back i noticed the BJB and stopped in to peruse their wares. I was immediatly greeted by a radiant angel behind the counter with the best musical sensibilities. I shopped around mostly pretending to be occupied with the cool (slightly expensive) clothes and trying not to overtly stare at her. We discussed music she played some radiohead on vinyl and we shared a cigarette; the real high point came when she pulled out a pair of really swell minnetonka leather fringe moccassins that she was going to sell herself assumably. I commented on how much i fancied them and she promptly sold them to me! at a very good price i might add. and while they were a little snug; three days of encasing my feet in the leather on the sunny sweltering grasses of coachella broke them in. All in all i love the BJB cause its a little nook of true vintage in a city whose population, for the most part,wouldnt dream of wearing something second hand! kudos BJB for your awesome stuff, friendly employees and funky soul!

Rosita's tisk tisk there is nothing to really say  it's not even that rosita's is bad, it's ...well...i guess i expected more on account of it's lifespan. The food here is mediocre, the service slow but friendly enough, and the ambience is purely no frills. I can't think of one single aspect of Rosita's which could distinguish it from the million other restaurants just like it scattered all thoughout our metropolis of strip malls like so much pollen in the wind. The only reason it gets 2 stars is cause i hate giving a bad review, and it's a local buisness and you gotta support your roots

For any poor basterd who thinks that "the Crazy Chicken" is good, i say try this chicken who isnt so crazy (or expensive) and your sox will be rocked! El Pollo grabs el pollo loco by the throat and stangles it into submission. if these two restaurants were in a cock fight you'd be foolish to place your money on the corporate backed "crazy" bird! Previous Yelpers have summed it up pretty nicely; The charbroiled red skinned chicken is roasted to perfection and the carne asada is grilled but not so much to make it tough, retaining its lovely hue of pink in the middle.  The combo plate is by far your best choice, giving you the advantage of both their delicious cow and bird meat on the same plate with accoutrements of sauteed red onions, pinto beans, and a uniquely homemade salsa fresca. Your choice of flour or corn tortilla. The chicken is unlike any other i have had, the skin is crispy and delicious and a crimson colour which screams eat me! If you've ever stepped outside of cartel and thought to yourself "what is that mesmorizing aroma!?" that my friend is El Pollo tantalizing you to step on in and have a wonderfully homecooked meal for under $10 Beat that El Pollo Loco!

folks who yelped this place prior to me couldn't be more on target: Arthur and his famz run a quality shop here they're all very knowledgeable and friendly esp. to me and my dog, as we own the same breed, boy did i get some brownie points for that one! lol i will never go to any other pet store, as i live a stones throw away and they have the BEST products you can buy. i encourage anyone who is a dog/horse owner to stop by you will not be disappointed!

Sometimes i swear that i have damaged my short term memory irrevocably, i have meant to write a review on Otto's for the longest time now and i always forget- not that they are forgettable by any means. Otto's Pizza is, hands down, my favorite pizza joint in all of Tempe. There is a lot of debate about what makes the perfect pie, and I'm not about to establish the ground rules, let's just say that my version of the perfect pizza was found here.  Otto's is such a good quality pizza, and their other items are equally delicious, whether it be calzones, pastas, or their desserts. Their prices are fair considering the pedigree of their cooking.  The atmosphere is quiet and space inside is small, but rarely crowded, with great patio seats for enjoying the cooler months. The gals who work here are gorgeous so xtra * for that! If it were possible i would sign a contract to only eat their pizza, bummer its closed on sundays!

If you have yet to come to Haji Baba's, then you may not know why almost everyone is in consensus that this place is the bee's knees.  I have yet to meet someone who has came to Haji Baba, and been disappointed..in fact I hope i never meet that person, cause they probably suck. HB is THE best place to get mediterranea/middle eastern food. It's fast authentic and cheeeeaaaaappp! The gyros and falafel will run you about ohh idk $2-$3 Everything on the menu is under or slightly hovering around/above $10 you can come here on a beggars budget and feast like a Turkish Sultan! conveniently located along the lightrail, deliciously prepared like your eating at your grandma's house, and so ridiculously affordable. The market side of HB's is full of goodies as well, be sure to browse on your way out/in. hands down "woohoo! as good as it gets!"

much like my eriberto's review there are certain guidelines and codes of conduct that are associated with Slices; and while i am currently a little too lazy to make an in depth crack at it here's the jist: steps to properly enjoy pizza at slices 1. drown yourself in alcohol;    slices is only tolerable if thoroughly drunk, otherwise thoughts like "i wonder how long these have been sitting out under those heat lamps for" or "why is my pizza cold" or "why does this taste strange" will pop into your head, ruining your meal. 2. don't bring your girlfriend here;     not only will she think you're a cheap dicknose but she'll look down on you for your horrible taste, and as a cautionary tale there is usually a minimum of 3-5 complete bromosexual pseudo-alpha males here decked out in their matching affliction shirts and amped up on enough cheap domestic light beer/red bull/anabolic steroids to make Danny Bonaducci look normal, just in case you might not want your special lady friend oggled&harassed. 3. avoid at all costs;    but if absolutely necessary to eat here- choose a meat free option.    my detractors will wish they'd heeded my words when they're crouched over the commode spewing up that bacteria infested pepperoni the next day. All in all, with the various pizza options in the area; -Otto's -Tessio's -Spinato's -La Bocca -Venezia's why would you eat this garbage?

Arai pastry is so delicious! ironically i come here not for the sweeties: confections, cakes, cookies, cremes, not being my style- but for their delicious savory treats! The breads they make here are top knotch, the various salty pastries are all worth exploring, the red bean one and the curry filled ones being my favorites. But the real deal, the Coup de grâce, the mamoth reason of what makes this little japanese pastry shop (in my mind) is their sandwhiches/ green tea shakes that powerful one two punch of savory sagacity is what makes me want to live sometimes yes yes i find the world to be a better place with those items in my tummy

Stopped by yesterday for some work, and i am very pleased with the results. After scouring the internet and questioning friends and aquaintances about the local tattoo parlor scene i opted to just keep it in the neighborhood. I highly recommend Eric, he knows what he's doing and he does it well; my first tattoo was quick easy and relatively painless, furthermore it was only $60. not bad not bad. I will definitely be going back when i have another idea in mind.

Hands down the best liquor store in Tempe. I go here exclusively. Their selection is enormous! from vino, to biere, and hard spirits of all varieties! If your anything of a hop enthusiastic like myself Tops is your home away from home. There is always something on special, like 12 pack cases of moosehead for  $6! or a 24 pack of pyramid seasonal ales for $12! My fav thing to do is just grab an empty six pack case and mix and match, a great way to discover new beer and old favorites. The staff is beyond cool as well; shout outs to Bill! I cant say enough good things about ol Tops Liquors, they let me bring my 70 lbs airedale terrier in the store for christ sakes! If you live in the area you already know. If your visiting friends or relatives in Tempe, drop buy pick up some brews and surprise your loved ones w/ a special treat, your wallett and your tipsy friends/famz will thank you!

previously reviewer couldn't be more correct; tokyo stop is a lot of bang for your buck the food is prepared really fast and its pretty delicious the portions are healthy and service is with a smile Last time i came here i just said "give me whatever is good" the owner/clerk/chef idk smiled widly and nodded several times and was off, in a mere matter of minutes he came back with a few beads of sweat on his brow and some wonderfully aromatic food sealed up inside a styrofoam takeaway box i get home and open it to discover a bed of steamed rice topped w/ spiced veggies; cabbage carrots, broccolli, etc etc, and huge chunks of white breaded chicken meat, apparently chicken katsu with sides of gyoza and dipping sauce and a humongous mound of soy beans, sooo many soy beans! home boy did not skimp on the soy beans! lol delicious and fast, service w/ a smile...did i mention it was like $7?? all grins from me ^_________^

Old town books is so awesome! It's hours are a little iffy but the place has such character and charm, and the owners are akin to the store- dusty, charming, and dare i say quaint? I love everything about the place, it's truly a mom and pop shop to a T! The selection isn't all encompassing but, that kinda goes without saying. You dont shop at OTB to find any and everything, but rather some obscure hard cover edition of a timeless classic, as in my case i found a beautiful gold leaf hardcover copy of Dosteovski's The Idiot, in vintage form, crisp and clean and just simply perfect. The owner sold it to me for something like $11. I remember at the time he commented how they'd run off the competition (the now defunct border's location that used to be on the corner of mill and 4th? st) and i found it funny, but deservedly true, OTB is now the only place on that small stretch of mill avenue that caters to the bibliophile, and i suggest people start taking advantage of them before it's too late!

As the 164th reviewer i feel pressured to be original and spin a yarn that will be deserving of such a hallowed and mythic bar. I cannot, however, as 163 people have robbed me of any original praises i might be able to sing of my beloved neighborhood standby. So im shaking off the cloak of endeavour, and loosening the albatross round my neck which squacks and screeches "be original! be daring! be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid!" and just gonna let the keystrokes fall where they may: Casey Moore's is the quintessential Tempe bar. It is a classy place, full of friends and neighbors that is home to so many. Thomas the bar cat could tell you as much, with her soulful and charming ways, but as she cannot speak i will do so for her. Casey's is home. It's a bar whose luxuries are enjoyed by young and old, hip and unhip, students, teachers, bar fly and newb, any and all.  It's a place whose epitaph would read "May you live as long as you want, And never want as long as you live." I firmly believe that Casey's is an establishment that strives to fulfill this for all of their patrons. They have never done me wrong and many a time have even come to my aid; whether it was a wretched drunk being 86'd after her provocations landed her into a fight with my girlfriend, or whether it was a beer spilled and dutifully replaced free of charge, whether it was a table shared with strangers, or the community of drunks & pleasure seekers still clinging onto the nights squandered dreams after last call. I feel at home at caseys: it's a place to rendevouz with old friends and a place to make new ones, It's a  lunch spot w/ my book in tow where pints are readily at hand, it's my start for the weekends pub crawl.  Casey Moore's i will always associate you and Tempe, even long after i am gone and moved on i will think back and smile at all the memories you have given me. thanks.

a great place to stop by for lunch. their lunch menu is ideally priced; $5 for a combo meal? beat that! Their crispy honey tofu is so friggen good, i am not sure what the sauce that coats it is made of, and im not sure i want to know really- they could tell me it was made of msg and the blood of sweet innocent virginal lambs and i wouldnt bat an eye, it's that good. I love this place, but i dont think it delivers, and if so def. not outside of it's general vicinity, which is a bit of a problem, 'cause i always forget where the eff this place is. I drive around for like an hour until i realize it's on guadalupe, and if your eyes aren't peeled it's very easy to miss. my favorite spot for quick, cheap, and tasty chinese takeout.

what an awesome store: it's got so much cool stuff, the staff is extremely  friendly and helful and it's right next door to retro ranch and two hippies! I'd love to come back here any time, it's the perfect place to find a funky and unique gift for a friend, or special someone. I ended up buying a vintage hello kitty piggy bank and an old timey card. It's a long story but the piggy bank broke on the way home...im sure that if i'd been able to give it to that special someone of mine she'd have loved it. hmmmph oh well. should i decide to work up the courage to buy her another potential gift I would definitely consider coming back to go kat go. Color me a fan!

The two young lovers, sat breathless in his vehicle.  He: tall- long of leg, sinewy and dissehveled would steal glances at her in his silent and profound admiration. She: Voluptuous, and indomitable, viewed the world, and all things in it, with awe and a unnerving love, that could move the mountains to tear, and silence the nightengale's song. She'd suggested the venue, and he'd all too willingly agreed- his easily won tryst belied a desire long dormant to share this experience with her- and she'd seen it a mile away. His meek jalopy pulled into Heritage Square's modest parking lot, and as if on cue a sleek mint conditioned sports car whizzed into the only vacant spot the eager young valet had reserved for this bourgeois prospected tipper, who'd no doubt been able to tip the valet better than He. The valet then guided Him to the parking structure located deeper inside the labrynthine Heritage Square, a parking lot assumably more suited to the likes of his mode of transport.  She left him, and with a promise of reserving their table they parted. A brief flash of reserve entered his mind, yet was quickly pushed out, as he navigated his way to the poorly described location of the parking garage. His beat up 96' Hyundai Accent he ironically dubbed the "egg" creaked and struggled out of the street and into a space. As he stepped out of the vehicle the crisp air of the night flooded his senses, the blooming trees of heritage square, and the dead leaves on the dirty ground accosted him with reminiscences of a home town, and land now long gone- momentary nostalgia. His brisk pace quickened and he was soon reunited with Her. She informed him of the wait, a potential two hours-This He'd been fully prepared for, and He grinned knowing that he was right ,and her assumption of speedily gaining a table due to the rains of the evening, dead wrong. They spent their wait together on the porch of a charming English ale house across the square, sipping stouts and India pale ales and discussing ontology, deconstructivism, and the merits of post modernist literature. When they'd realized it was their time to check in, they'd overstayed their wait by 15 minutes or so, and were informed by the stylish young hostess that they'd need to wait a bit longer. No matter. They chatted with the barmaid, and made a fast and easy aquaintance.  The night then found them seated at their own table, in a sultry dimly lit corner, on a humble wooden table seemingly hewn out of a wizened tree whose soul aim in its years of existence had been to comfort and house the glorious repasts ordered by the thousands of patrons who'd shared in the hospitality of this former tree. The kindly and attentive servers, had amicably and expertly suggested various dishes and spirits to accompany them. He discussed the menu with Her, their eyes dancing in the bossa nova the candle light effused, they held hands 'neath the table and felt encompassed in the joy of being near one another. A Bianco Verde & Rosa. The simple and unpretentious pies made their senses dance, re wrote in their young minds the possibilities of cuisine,  and filled them with wonder and grattitude, in no way were they begrudged by the wait- rather it had given them time to acclimate, and enjoy their leisurely evening of epicurean delights. He realized, that as he stared into the depths of that evergreen pizza, and breathed deep of the aromas of the brick oven, swooned over the extravagant flavours- that nothing in this world save love, could craft something so perfect. In that moment, without words- they two realized that it was love that had brought them together, and so would they remember Bianco, for it was love that brought them there.

I love Barrio Cafe. Everything about it: the tiny wooden tequila bar in the front of the restaurant, their spotless interior with thick cloth napkins, that they bring out a spicy olive tapenade with sliced baguette in lieu of salsa and chips, their phenomenal brunch which at times is accompanied with live flamenco style guitarists, the cholo-esque mural on the outside of the building, the lucha libre artwork inside, and the playful and creative dishes chef Silvana offers up that cannot fail to please even the most finicky of palates. If I was forced to think of a downside to Barrio, I would suppose it'd be the parking situation, it being sparse at best. Barrio Cafe is a Phoenix staple.

What do you say about a place that is almost universally loved? What else can you do but heap more praise onto it, at the risk of seeming sycophantic ? Lux is certainly amongst the best of the best, for coffee in all of the greater phoenix metropolitan area. In all five areas of criterion: ~Taste: * * * * * the coffee brewed and sold here is perfect, the confections and baked goods are simply wonderful. ~Decor: * * * * * note the striking array of chairs and seating, along w/ additional patio seating make for optimal outside and inside digs ~Pricing: * * * * * nothing here is expensive, and considering the quality of the product sold, very economical ~Service: * * * * * the barristas are helpful, friendly and good natured, perfectly willing to explain the menu and offer tips advice, please tip them! ~Ambience: * * * * * this ties in w/ decor but is meant to be more along the lines of "scene" and the players in that scene. the folks who frequent Lux are my kinda folks (not as much as conspire but close) young, professional, hip, artsy, intelligent, down town people who know good coffee when they see/smell/taste it So hoped that helped for the fence sitters, if for some reason you were perched precariously upon the fence to beging with.

You really can't go wrong with Via De Los Santos, their menu is pretty typical but it's hearty and delicious standard az style mexican fare. I've came Here several times and every time I've left satisfied and without complaint. The Margaritas are tasty, the chimi's are huge and the salsa spicy. The outdoor patio is great just to relax and chat with friends on a balmy night. This is one of my favorite places to swing by and, to quote a yelp hero of mine, ''retox' after a long hike on the slope.

FEZ is great anytime really, but after experiencing their weekend brunch, i must say, that this is probably one of the best deals you can get for the brunch scene. The weekend brunch cocktail list is over the top (and no not the stallone arm wrestling movie either): mimosas, greyhounds, and bloody marys for $3!! My bloody mary was spicy, stiff and tall, with two green pimento olives and lemon & lime wedges. After two of them i was feeling pretty good! The brunch menu is awesome, huge portions, delicious and varied selection of dishes, and ballpark, prices roughly of $10 or so. FEZ is definitely a viable option for breakfast, and probably your best bet for brunch!

This is a reivew that is long overdue; Carly's is probably my first choice for bar/ restaurants in central phx, for a couple of reasons: ~Their food is just delicious, specifically the sandwiches: my two personal favorites being the pear panini and the tuscan panini. The soups are a good option as well, not to mention the orzo salad which seems to please everyone. ~The Beer selection is really great, there are some tasty brews on tap here that you can feel classy about drinking along w/ your meal. Not to mention the $2 PBR's that'll do the job nice and quick and on the cheap. ~The prices are really fair, you can get a delicious well proportioned meal along w/ a round of brews for under $20, and as a student / young man crippled w/ debt this is something i truly appreciate. Unfortunatly i always seem to come to Carly's on those full moon evenings when all the CenPho foodies come out of the woodwork stumbling like corpses risen from the grave, swanky zombies in search of brain paninis preventing me from getting my favorite table, blocking the bar with their tangled masses, queing up in front of the restrooms.... enough with this zombie metaphor it's not really working.. i give carly's two swollen thumbs up!

Dear American Apparel,        I have to start this off with an apology, as a reformed shoplifter i must admit that your stores are practically begging to be ripped off, however i now see the err of my ways and seek your forgiveness. There was a time when your store of beautiful threads, taunted me. The obvious lack of security devices, and apathetic clerks, coupled w/ no visible cameras were like personal invitations to grift for me. I love your clothes, the way they wear, and that they are made in america, and that you pay your workers a liveable wage. That is awesome. I just simply cannot afford your clothes. bottom line. I have had a lot of growing up to do, and it took the theft of my entire wardrobe and nearly getting caught a couple of times to teach me that stealing is bad. So forgive me AA, i have gone thru the 9 steps of American Apparel Shoplifting Aholics Anonymous or AASAA. Someday i will pay you back, w/ good deads and public service...probably.

Three roots is a very cool little place tucked away in a strip mall along mill avenue, circa the chipotle across from campus. Its the perfect spot to grab a snack and some coffee or tea and get lost in your reading or schoolwork. Every time i have been in here its so low key and mumblecore, which appeals to me. The decor inside is so reminiscent of old friends apartements and houses that it floods me with nostalgia when i walk in! the menu is pretty tasty as well, all decently priced. there are many vegan options which is a def. plus.

I've probably only been to the Roosevelt 3 or 4 times, and each experience i've had was different, from bad to mediocre to great. I think it really depends on how many people have crammed into such a limited and intimate space. The same could be said of the Lost Leaf- but honestly i have a great time at the LL no matter the occupancy....the "Roose" is different tho. I think maybe it's the akwardness of standing and being in everyone's way and having table/ seat envy. This last visit myself and three lovely ladies I happen to have the pleasure of knowing came here last friday (a 1st Fri. @ that) we got ourselves some drinks and stood idly for a few moments waiting for the bar to open up, which it didn't. thankfully a waitress sauntered by and asked me what my poison was. I ordered a beer and the girls and I stood and chatted. Finally a few seats at the long rectangular table in the back room opened up, we quickly seized our opportunity and sat ourselves. The evening was nice enough, crowded and loud, we were still able to hold our side conversations if not converse as a group. My friend ordered herself a white wine, and i ordered another pabst. The scene was loud and crowded as i'd mentioned, with leering wandering eyes all around, it seemed as if everyone was posturing and sizing each other up. My special lady friend was starting to get a creepy vibe from a guy across the room, maybe 10 years her senior, who couldnt keep his eyes of her, and i cant say i blame him. She murmurs something along the lines of "why is that guy looking at me" and of course we all look in his direction, he smiles embarasedly and hobbles over and says something stupid like "is something wrong??" "i dont know IS something wrong?" i ask him he mutters something else and walks away shame faced. We sat for a few moments longer and had some pleasant conversation in a charming atmoshpere as the crowd died down.  Next time i come here i will make it a point to come early and order food (which looks delicious) cloister myself and my company in one of the rooms, and just hold down the fort all night.

Everything said before me is true. The good the bad and the ...not so bad. God i would be so more than willing to bump this up to 5 stars, IF they opened their doors on Sun! C'MON! everytime I awake on a sunday, I salivate at the thought of essence, and then thrash in my bed and beat my pillows as my dog stares confused because he has no idea Essence is closed on Sunday This place is so awesome  just please consider those of us who arent forced to attend church services on sunday, and open your doors so we can have goddamned breakfast!

Siu wok is a clean, fast, and decent chinese take out option. I still havent found truly authentic and amazing Chinese food in Az. but this is about as good as a chinese-american take out place you could ask for.  They have some really great deals as far as lunch options and combo meals are considered, and their wait staff is attentive and subservient to say the least.  I would say that this is really an 3 star "A-Ok" type of joint, but the clean atmosphere, cheap prices, and portion size here really bumped it up another star. It's always hard to rate Az chinese restaurants, as I feel like that isnt something that we do so well down in the SW, as compared to the NW or CA, so maybe my rating is a little askew. However I will say this: be you in central Phoenix one night, and if you feel like some comforting chinese take out that isnt overly greasy, than Siu Wok is a perfectly viable option. The Lo-Mein, cold, straight outta the fridge the next morning is a wonderful breakfast.

I have gone on the record innumerable times, and voiced my brazen opinion to any and all who will listen: my hatred of the cupcake runs deep- or USED (should be italicized but yelp has failed to provide this option, note that a capitalized "used" in this context is meant to imply emphasis rather than shouting) to.... Urban Cookies, you are, to borrow the monicre of the brilliant patrick, So Urbane! the quality of your cupcake is cake quality, the frostings are to die for, and your cookies are beyond delicious, they are scrumptrilescent! you've made a believer outta me, and i challenge anyone to present me a cupcake that is half as good as yours! come payday and around 4...hmm 35 ish i will be there! woofreakinhooasdamngoodasitgets *drops microphone*

Okay so wow i knew this review would be tough, but i didnt know it'd be this hard i have so many mixed emotions about this little train that could. it's hard to even fit it all on here. my problems w/ the light rail are more universal arguments that im sure given time and a sizeable return on the original investment we will see fixed.  I guess the best way to describe the lightrail, assuming this review is for people who've never stepped foot on it, is through a couple of personal experiences i've had that i think sum it up pretty well. The lightrail has character, it is egalitarian, and it spares no one. If you think for one second that stepping onto this crazy train you wont get off w/ some kind of story, good or bad, then you are wrong sonny jim. MY worst experience had to be a couple years back, maybe a year to date. My ex-girlfriend and i were headed down to the former spot of party foul, a hipster themed dance party, hosted at the now defunct Homme. It was a friday? night and the rails were packed, massive crowds gathered at the stations and huddled together in clumps, aggregates of souls all headed in the same direction. Our westbound train finally arrives, from the more eastern reaches of tempe/mesa, bursting at the seams w/ ppl. the xgf and i manage to grab a spot in the tube where bicycles are docked. it was elbow to elbow, folks sitting on top of another. She sat, and i stood in front of her gripping on the railings facing her, with bodies all around us. it was claustrophobic but our ride wasnt that long. Halfway to our destination, a troupe of loud and flamboyant....Im guessing, what only could have been, *gulp* musical theatre students assembled onto our train. They were en masse, and must've numbered in the 20-30's, armed w/ harmonies and a keyboardist. They started to warm their voices, shortly before giggiling they burst into song. Flat out belting it out there, with no shame or regard to their fellow riders potential hatred of broadway musicals. "525,600 MINUTES! 525,600 moments so dear....." Oh god i could feel my stomach turning, i'd desperately wished i was more drunk. My embarassment was rising, and much to my chagrin i noticed nearly our entire car, gazing at the singers w/ their breath held and hands clasped, they stood enraptured.  "525,600 minutes, How do you measure, measure a year????"  This was my nightmare, my personal hell: trapped, unable to move, surrounded by something i loathe more than most things, it's melodies raping my ears. I felt like i was surrounded by the gaggling childish happy go lucky bull shit of my freshman theatre days.  I looked at my exGF, she shared my pain, bless her. So there we sat, sardine prisoneros in a train of glee. After each song the entire car would erupt in applause and cheers, and it was only us who seemed to be disgusted and embarassed. go figure. When we finally got to the central & roosevelt station i couldnt wait to shove my way off that train of glee, only to my horror the musical theatre kids were getting off here as well. I grabbed my exGF's hand and we ran off the train like the beatles in a hard days night, somewhere, anywhere away from these horrible brats and their falsettos. Since that time there have been many more isolated incidents of the strange, shocking, and uncomfortable onboard the light rail. Just last tuesday night i had a run in w/ some drunk d-backs fans who can only be described as douche-backs. I love the lightrail, but just be forewarned that never will your ride be free and easy, expect the weird in all its forms.

The clubhouse occupies a very special and sentimental place in my heart. I've probably only seen maybe 3 shows here, but im always surprised by what i encounter in this little grungy hole in the wall. I understand the previous yelpers complaints, even empathize. But i give them a hearty 5 stars of sheer grattitude, whether of not they deserve it; I met my 1st girlfriend at the clubhouse one night quite by accident, it was at a show for seawolf / okkervil river. Something magical happened in that dank smoky  slightly smelly venue and i love the clubhouse for it. So despite the complaints, despite the less than savory acts that play here sometimes, and despite the abundance of hipster brats you might encounter; give the clubhouse a chance- open your heart to life's possibilities and embrace the good and the bad.

Sometimes long winded explanations as to why places are great can grate on you... haha "great...grate"  *ahem* at any rate there is only one thing I can say about La Canasta, and I will stand by this conviction until proven wrong: "BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT IN THE VALLEY" go ahead and prove me wrong.

Dropped in last night with the lovely Karen F. for dinner, as she'd had a groupon for a free meal. We made the trek to the far east; a magical realm of farms and sprawling ranch estates track homes and mormons, the rugged windswept towne of Gilbert. Salerno's is nothing fancy, but neither am I, it feels very casual and at ease in the dim restaurant interior, similar to a pizza parlor in Show Low my family and I used to frequent when I was a youngun'. However Salerno's has one key advantage over that little pizza parlor in the white mountains: their pizza is actually edible and doesn't taste like cardboard with a tongue scalding layer of poor quality cheese dusted on top. She'd told me in advance that this was one of her father's favorite pizza joints, even going so far as to say it'd be his deathrow meal. I was impressed, as he and I usually are in agreement on most subjects, and while I would agree that Salerno's is good it wouldnt be my last meal on this tiny blue dot, that being said it's a def. four stars for the following reasons: ~Considering the location, I'm almost certain that it trumps most other places in the area, I could be entirely wrong, but I'd be willing to bet my tax return that Gilbert isn't known for it's variety of quality pizza places. That being said, the pizza we ordered- A regular style crust with extra mozzarella, garlic and spinach was really tasty. The crust was soft and chewy, bubbly and blackened on the outer edges, and just pretty good quality overall, the sauce was vaguely sweet and had a good amount of basil in it, and the toppings were all decent and hard to ruin, thankfully the spinach was fresh and wasnt canned, bigups for that. ~The customer service here is really great, our waiter was a youngish dude probably our age yet he was attentive and polite and very accomodating, all adjectives I would refrain from using on people of my age group. When we told him we were going to use our groupon for the small pizza we ordered he said we hadn't even racked our bill to $20 yet, being that Karen F. is a vegetarian and I am a devout lover of all the heavenly parts of the sacred pig, I saw my opportunity and pounced "Could you just blast the remaining slices in our take away bag w/ some Italian Sausage and we'll call it even?" and sure enough he one upped me, he returned w/ a full link smothered in their signature marinara in a separate tray, saving Karen F. the grief of dealing w/ pig flesh. All in all it was a good experience and I would advise any Gilbertians to give 'em a try!

okay to quote the Stones; you're not the only one, with mixed emotions!  I am and will continue to be a loyal SW airlines customer, I've only traveled with them, and I must say I dont have any complaints with the pilots, sexy stews, and the quality of their planes prices yada yada yada BUT (and this is an epic but, like Kim Kardashian's, or J.Lo's, or Kirstie Alley's or ...well you get the picture) Whoever the ambivalent imp, who haphazardly handled this patrons luggage on my return trip from california, is should be dragged out from his hiding place, sealed inside the thunderdome and viciously torn to shreds by a mutant with retard strength- while I cackle from a platform with a silver lightning shaped streak in my jew fro and the sequins on my bedazzled Tina Turner outfit glimmer in the dusk of a day permeated with my vengeance. *cough cough*  ahem where was I... oh yeah, My huge beef with this airline is how careless the baggage handlers are, I've watched them unload peoples bags from their little carts they drive around the tarmac on, and those guys act as if they're lobbing piles of garbage off a dump truck. I have, no had, a vintage WWII rucksack my uncle gave me for christmas one year that I used to use for all my travels. It was sturdy and had survived a fucking world war for christ sake! well once the careless monkeys SW employs to handle their customers baggage got their mits on it, it returned to me from the baggage carousel with two of its leather straps broken, and some articles missing. giant WTF moment for me, minor incident for them. no scratch that, it isnt an incident if you cant even get an apology out of a single one of their employees. Needless to say nowadays I pack light enough to ensure I dont have to check my bags.

This is an awkward review for me to write for several reasons: -I frequent this gym almost every other day at least 4-5 times per week -The folks who work here are all really nice ppl and totally willing to help you acheive your fitness goals should you purchase their services -The machines are decent, and there is something there to work any and all muscles in your body, often times 2 of the same apparatus -The other gym patrons are quiet and keep to themselves -Never once has it been super crowded, even during peak hours okay so whats up? why the bad review? well it's conditional, and is highly subject to change, albeit...once renovations are complete. As it stands now this LA Fitness is a graduated big room, there are no lockers, tennis/racquet ball courts, no piscina! The bathrooms are outside for christ sakes! BUT once the renovations are complete, all that will be a thing of the past.  I fully intend on updating this once the work is done, but until then i cant in good conscience give this anything higher than a ** review

The Rogue West: tight jeans, white t-shirts, coiffed hairdos, wallet chains, beat up hot rods, marlboro reds, PBR's, ripped pool tables, grungy bathrooms, semen stained couch, wood panneling, dim lighting, sarcastic bad ass bar tender, dark haired jaded women, upright basses, checker board tile, black and red paint, perpetually hogged jukebox, seedy clientele, baby makin' boogyin' tunes... The Rogue West is like a scene out of American Graffiti. Hidden within the bowels of an innocuous strip mall it's surroundings belie the vortex of cool that this place is. The scene; a saturday night assumedly wasted in glendale, I arranged to meet up with the lovely Barbara G. and our mutual friend Katie, my brother Justin, and our mutual friend Scott. After a quick toke in the garage the girls arrived to pick us up, and Barbara G. drove our gang to The Rogue West. As we pulled into the parking lot we spotted our destination, and a collective anxiousness settled on our group. "Is this it?!" someone said, I could tell by the tone of the question a seeming paranoia disappointment and fear had seized the ranks. I downplayed this with an offhanded remark, and bolstered my own waning resolve. The building stares into the parking lot like a battered and bruised window less testament to our failed economy, garishly splashed with black and red paint like the face of some downtrodden whore, equally as inviting. Dont let this fool you, as we all know, you cannot judge something by it's appearence.  Our gang then stepped inside and with some momentary trepidation, they followed as I strolled eagerly to the bar. A quick occular pat down suggested the threat of any form of hostility was non existant. I inquired with the barkeep, Bruce, what beers they had on tap, as Barbara G. cooed approvingly in my ear, my attention must've been visibly diverted to her, as Bruce snapped at me "Hey ya listening!?" "no.." I replied with some guilt, as he rattled off the answer to my question. We all ordered some pabsts for $2, and started a round of pool, which was graciously free. We shot some rounds, poured a couple bucks into the juke, and listened to a really good rockabilly style 3 piece band, whose name had something to do with "Pee Wee" in it. Overall our experience was thoroughly enjoyed, and I think I may just have found my new favorite place on the west side to wet my whistle.

After living downtown a while now I had to come to think I'd never find a rebound for Haji Baba, I grew despondent and longed for their market and cheap delicious food, on the light rail rides that brought me to Haji Baba my mouth would water as I anticipated my falafel and hummus and favorite confections. I became resigned and assumed I'd just have to make the long trek down there every time the hunger struck. Then as fate would have it the "Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli" caught my eye, luring me in with the hint of what treasures I might find inside. Not only am I over you Haji Baba, I'm thriving, you see I've found a place that is probably better for me than you'd ever be. So with that in mind, and some appropriate mood music let me give a litany of reasons why i promise to love you complete Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFIOu2sYxoc -your falafel is delicious, it is probably the best I've ever had, and for a few bucks you can buy a plate of them, appropriately tiny and crispy golden and crunchy on the outside and warm soft and flavourful on the inside. with tzatziki sauce or some warm hummus and soft pita they make a perfect meal. -your bakery and deli is so welcoming and comfortable and merely a short bike ride away from my place of residence -your prices are so reasonable i almost feel guilty.. -your baked goods and confections and broad selection of middle eastern delicacies is heart warming to me. -and your lemonade! lordy. probably the best i've ever had, and i dont just say that about every piece of lemonade i've bagged. -your owners are so kind and welcoming, they make you feel right at home. ;^) i love middle eastern bakery and deli, and despite the generic name it is what it purports to be, and that's a quality that is becoming increasingly rare.

Pho Avina's reputation couldn't be more hard earned! It's usually packed with customers to prove it! They deserve every bit of a 5 star rating! Their food is generous, and cooked with love. Their prices are modest and the menu is ripe with dishes all of such delicious properties as to make you come back and sample and savour every new choice. This place has come a long way, and it's nice to see it doing so well. Every time i come to visit my parents and friend on the west side, i have to consider this as a serious contender for that evenings meal. I hope to be back soon!!

dear switch,   thank you. from the bottom of my heart. for hosting a crowd of rowdy drunken and often shouting yelpers to your oh so generous weekend brunches. i hope to make this a weekly ritual, wherein i pay my respects to the patron god of the aztecs and their sacred drink the bloody mary; poured into a massive carafe, garnished with celery and made from the fresh innocent virgin blood of pubescent spanish girls. on behalf of my yelp crew and im gonna go ahead and say all of the phoenix yelp community: thank you, you make sunday/saturday mornings a happy blurry drunk driving fun day that i cherish!

Holy God If you are an outdoorsey kinda guy then this is your mecca,  (provided your an east ender, my assumption is westies go to cabela's) Bass Pro shop is the vatican for east side outdoor worshipers, there are 2 floors of everything from guns (pistols, shotties, rifles) to boats (bass boats, pontoon boats, etc) to gear and tackle of every sort. I bought my dad a measly $50 gift certificate last christmas and we made our pilgrimage here, and holy sheep shit i did not know what we were in for! We spent like 5 hours here, and all we ended up buying was a knife and some 12 gauge buckshot. I recommend checking it out just for the novelty of it all.

Chompy's is a tempe breakfast/lunch/brunch staple there are an overwhelming amount of options, enough to keep you coming back time and again the prices are decent and affordable, considering the quality and portions of food you receive their bakery is pretty phenomenal and the bagels & bialys (sp?) are top knotch Whenever i'm sick and need some good ol "jewish penicillin" i stop  by chompies and pick up their matzo ball soup, its healing properties are something i will swear by!

I love the HQ! I come here weekly to fulfill my tobacco addiction, the monkey on my back not being satisfied with anything less than American Spirits sold at premium prices, seriously cheapest i have found them in the valley is here $7 something i believe. Whats more is they have a great selection of parphenalia, from glass works to old school stuff all priced at premium rates.  The posters and stickers here are really cool as well and cheaper than zia or hippie gypsie.  Pretty sure you can buy concert tix here too!  The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and talkative.  I had a friend that moved to Portland and she had this bunny that she couldnt take with her, well she was complaining about said rabbit (bun bun i think his name was) and a pretty little chica who worked there overheard this and well, long story short Bun Bun found a home! Not saying take your unwanted pets here; just that that is the kind of people who work here, really nice folks who hook it up.

I love mitchell dog park! its probably the biggest in the area, and it's usually full of nice owners and good dogs that range in temperment from happy go lucky to slothful to mildy aggressive but i have never seen a full out dog fight here so thats good, most owners will jump to it the minute their dog starts getting rowdy and apologize frantically. I have to voice some of my qualms though just to explain why i am not giving this lovely park a 5 star rating: this goes out to all the "dog freaks" out there. I myself am a dog person, i love dogs! i understand the way they act and think. they want to play and sniff and hump, they need to nip and jump and get a little rowdy. its their language. a dog needs to assert the pack order, regardless of where they are at. sadly some dog owners treat their pooches like their children, and thats where all the problems come in, enter the "dog freaks" now there is one lady in particular who really, really, gets my goat. She has a great dane the size of a small pony, and this dog towers over my 70lb airedale, a big boy in his own right. Well my goof ball dog and i had the bad luck of running into great dane lady several times. Seems like she was always there for a little while. In our first encounter she was highly neurotic wandering around fussing over this highstrung mini pinscher whom, she had assumed been abandoned by its owner (who was sitting quietly in the far corner) she kept walking around with it in her arms saying "whose mini peen sherr is this?? whose mini peen sherr is this!? well i guess you've got a new friend girl (said to her horse dog)" finally the owner comes over calls his dogs, the mini pinscher leaps out of her arms and scurries to his master they leave. Now my dog is def an alpha male, and likes everyone to know it. whenever a new dog comes in he barrels over to the entrance overexcitedly in a desperate effort to get the first sniff.  Well enter Great Dane Lady again, she takes the liberty to grab my dogs collar every time he tries to run to the gate and says in an annoyed raised voice "IS THIS YOUR DOG!!?? IS HE FIXEDDD???" "yes" i reply "could you please let go of him?" "FINE! BUT YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT OBEDIENCE SCHOOL!" wow umm fuck you? who the hell is she to tell me how to raise my dog? Another instance my ex girl friend was walking my dog to mitchell while i was at work and the minute she stepped inside, Great Dane Lady looks at her and my dog in contempt and says "WE'RE LEAVING BECAUSE OF YOUR DOG!" what a bitch! okay now that im done with my tangent; mitchell is a great park, just beware of the "dog freaks" who will try to make you feel like crap if you have a hyper dog. p.s. whitey and his owner are usually drunk/high but they're nice enough, i actually shared a mickey's out of a styrofoam cup with Whiteys owner, he's harmless.

Happiness is a warm gun. I think about that turn of phrase a lot. What it means is up for debate, ask the dearly departed spirit of John Lennon next time you have a seance if you think it really matters. To me, happiness is a new record, and one of the best spots to chase that high is at Revolver.    Revolver is always changing, like the line up of any particular Brian Jonestown Massacre album, you'll never be quite sure what's in stock- and isn't that half the fun? For me it is. I love the excitement that comes with perusing that new arrivals bin, thumbing through each and every 45, sometimes you come up for air after an intense dive into the murky depths with nothing, emptyhanded and at a loss. A person could easily write off the joint as a bust and never come back, and secretly I hope they do, 'cause then there's less competition amongst the audiophiles that haunt the establishment like barnacles on an ancient ships hull.   In all honesty whenever good stuff comes in, and it does all the time, it's usually snatched up. Somedays it's you doing the snatching, and other days it's some beardy faced bespectacled asshole with his hitlerian hairdo perfectly quaffed sauntering away with that Stone Roses lp that was by all rights yours, I mean c'mon that hipster dingus probably can't even name one member of the band and you just know he snatched that up out of your clutches from a purely spiteful place, fuck him right??  *AHEM*   Revolver holds this special place in my heart, it was where I was baptised in fire and began this journey down the lonely path of the vinyl enthusiast. I remember bringing my entire CD library and trading it straight out for a turn table, speakers, a receiver and my very first album (Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life). How green and naive I was to this whole world back then, how intimidated and bumbling I was; but the fine gentlemen of Revolver dashed about the store assembling it all for me, cherry picking their favorite pieces of equipment the shop had stashed away and making sure I was getting hooked up, or "turned on tuned in and dropped out". If revolver was a house of the lord in the faith of the one true apostolic church of vinyl I'd like to think myself a thoroughly devout layman, eager to discover what mysteries awaited.

Prior to the young mans arrival he'd found himself at a loss for words as to how he wished his unruly fro to be changed, all he'd had was the faith that this hair artist, whom he'd heard through rabid word of mouth, would take charge- and with a vision all his own, not just cut, nay but create a whole new head of hair for him to leave the salon tall and proud and better than when he'd come in. Jorge was an artisan of hair, quiet and humble, he let his work do the talking for him. With a string of well phrased questions he posed to the young lanky man dressed in a ensemble of anachronisms he determined the perfect battle plan. After a thorough shampooing and conditioning of his shaggy head he set about his plan of attack and for the next hour or so whittled away at the bushy mass. The artist at work shears in hand; a careful penetrating eye, intuition reigning powerfully in his confident mind; he sculpted the gangly young man's tangled mass of black ringlet and cowlick with a swift deftness that left no lock untouched. And as the day darkened into evening and the young patrons neck grew stiff with rigidity, Jorge looked upon his creation and it was good. With a flourish he whirled the barber chair so that his customer saw his work and a tell tale grin flashed upon his lips: he was pleased with his work, not only pleased but thankful. Whether or not Jorge knew it- he'd made a new client, and that client just so happened to be as loyal as the terrier he owned, whose fur, some had remarked, looked as similar as his owners: no longer.

A lazy sunday afternoon sadly however this would involve no cupcakes or narnia but rather two brothers and their schwinns perusing cen pho lil bro and i cruise by this awesomely funky little house covered in art head to toe, inside and out so we stop in to smell the roses and conspire doesnt fail to deliver for $3.50 we order ourselves a large iced coffee, deliciously strong a sign on the inside cautions: "there is no such thing as strong coffee only weak men!" so maybe i should say...flavorful instead of strong lol at any rate conspire is probably one of the coolest little secrets in the valley. cheers! i hope to be back every time i visit mi hermano in cen pho ^__^

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: First off let me say that if your giving a poor review cause you had to wait for a few minutes, or if your barrista seemed aloof? pump the breaks a bit! dont be so sensitive or zee germans will get ya! do we really wanna trash a place's street cred cause your feelings were hurt? c'mon grow up and realize its about the product man! Personally i disagree with the likes of that douchecake. (see below). I LOVE Cartel! the baristas are all top notch, friendly, fast, and cool the owners ( J. & A.) couldn't be more nice and sociable *i truly appreciate when people can remember your name, esp. if your going there every other day* Been coming here for about two years now and its honestly the best  coffee shop in Tempe only gripe is that it seems like the hipster olympics are being held there now!  lately i can barely breath between all the anemic brats in keffiyahs and toms shoes fiddling on the mac books i would recommend it; but dont go cause there wont be any room for me!

Okay so to be fair i must explain my 2 star rating; it is extremely conditional and is most likely not the restaurants fault but nevertheless im dishing out my wrath, but with restraint as well: a while back i came here on a date. It was a cool autumnal (phoenix's version of autumn) night and as we stepped inside we were told by the hostess that there were no tables available and that we'd have to wait 15 min or so. No big deal. We asked if we could sit outside on the patio, 'sure' we were told 'a server will be right with you'. we sit down, chit chat, exchanging pleasantries and, diggi do, the minutes fly by. 5 min pass and not even a glance from inside. 8 min pass and still not even a water. I was famished at that point and was starting to get cranky, my then girlfriend sensed this and was getting anxious at my growing irritation. we start trying to make eye contact with someone inside; nothing. 10 minutes go by and we sit unnoticed. we waited, and waited. discussing the menu. trying to be patient.  after 20 some odd minutes we were about to round the thity minute mark when i'd had enough. Being that it wasn't even my idea to eat there, and that i was starving (not too mention we hadnt even been given water at this point) i flew into a temper tantrum and demanded we leave immediatly.  Granted i could've stepped inside and asked for service but that just seemed embarassing and unnecessary from my point of view. So all in all my loath for Bocca has little or nothing to do with their food, as i've never been privledged to try it, but more to do with being treated like a filthy undesireable proletariate-  which i may or mayn't be....but thats hardly for them to decide. you've disappointed me Bocca.

I love this place, it's got charm a'plenty, and chock full of character, its a gem! I love that the owner is now synonomous with the restaurant for me, so much so that when someone mentions la piccola cucina i will immediatly think of his smiling rotund face.

This gas station is like the bermuda triangle of gas stations! I came here w/ a friend on a first friday, she was DD'ing and i was her passenger "and i ride and i ride i ride through the city's backside.." until we eventually reached E and desperatly needed petrol. Like a suspicious siren this little green long necked demon sang to us, luring us in w/ his dino siren song. As we pulled in a car was broken down near the entrance and several dudes were milling around the engine, hood propped open, pondering their next move. I grimaced at their misfortune. We filled up, i strolled inside to pay for my friend Kathy's gas and get some munchies. I walk back out to her car and pump her gas, we chat and make jokes. All the while i notice Kathy is so sketched out, ( a case of white girl from the burbs out of her comfort zone late at night down town). Gas pumped check. We climb back in, she turns the key in the ignition, and dead silence. A mere clicking and then nothing. SSSHHHIIIIIIITTTT. she starts panicking, i can only help but laugh at our misfortune. Two cars in the same gas station broken down. Our situation only seemed more dire as time passed, and each car that came to Sinclair refused to help us, or just shirked us off w/ some lame excuse. It was only until two young mexican teenagers came to our rescue that we were able to move. the other car had managed to start up, and the boys asked the men in spanish if they could give us a jump, reluctantly they agreed. The Mexican men swung their beater over towards Kathy's engine and we hooked up the cables and...LIFE! we said our thank yous and shook hands, and then brought the teens back to their homes, much to the protest of my scared white girl associate.  Had it not been for those wonderful people we'd have been stranded at the Bermuda Sinclair possibly till day break.

pizza a metro is decidely good. I don't think there is any disputing that. You'd have to be a stone cold douche to disagree. I would be so bold as to say that their pizza is amongst the top 10 in the valley. I'm not sure of its rank but it'd definitely be up there in my list. I dropped in last night after class with a rumbling belly and craving some good pizza, I'd read some of it's reviews a while back, and realized it was on thomas, essentially down the street from PC.  Pizza A Metro is the definition of a hole in the wall, easily missed by thoughtless drivers and the uninitiated. Thanks to Yelp and word of mouth it wasnt too epic of a quest to find, however I did lose an elderly bearded companion of mine as we battled a giant demon with a flaming whip and the bridge we were standing on collapsed- after that, it wasnt too difficult to get to. I stepped inside, and immediatly I was struck by how charmingly quaint the interior was. Quaint in this circumstance is a euphemism for small, but since when did bigger mean better? (ladies this is not in reference to me, best believe!) Although a little cramped it is very welcoming and warm inside, you instantly feel at home. I stood awkardly next to a full table of women on a "girls night out" until the owner urged me to wait at a table, he grabbed me some water and then waltzed off to chat with the other patrons. The entire time I was waiting he was chatting with the various tables and assumedly ensuring that everything was to their liking. When my pizza was done, I paid at the counter and was impressed with the pricetag: $9 and some change for a rather large "small" Margherita Pizza. The pizza was phenomenal, and the price tag was appreciated as I just bought an $87 text book. I will def. be back soon.

Lee Lee's supermarket is pretty amazing it's really huge and with all the varieties of groceries and produce meats seafood, you could really spend an entire evening there shopping in amazed confusion and delight, this review is NOT however for LEE LEE the market this is for "Hope Kee" the little restaurant inside the market. as far as Chinese restaurants go this place was really just nothing special. Big portions for entrees hovering around $10 all a tad greasy but not in a bad way. I happened to order some Yu Shan Eggplant that came in a bubbling clay pot, my grandmother ordered some Baby Bok Choy in Garlic Sauce, My sister the lettuce wraps, and brother got the bbq chicken and duck, my mom decides on some pot stickers. All in all the food was tasty, and i enjoyed myself. As far as chinese restaurants go it wasnt really bad but nothing stellar. Here's where the real problem came in. The bill arrives, and there is an automatic 15% gratuity already deducted, we were told for parties of 4 or more, however nowhere on the menu was this listed. My mom flips and spends the next 30 minutes arguing with the waitress, requesting her card's transaction reversed, and the automatic gratuity taken off.  At this point i was shopping in the supermarket looking at cookies and room temperature mochi. After a few minutes of shopping w/ my little sister, a few more minutes sitting in the car w/ my brother my matriarchs return triumphant in their war of tipping etiquette w/ the waitress and they vow never to return again. Personally i had no problem with the place, but ooh do not cross my mother or grandmother when it comes to a restaurant bill, cause they will cut a bitch's throat for $2 I probably wont be coming back here for fear my mom will disown me

WOW cannot believe this place has such a good rating!? pourquoi?? IMO "perro sediento" is completely "meh. i've experienced better" the prices here are, well a little ridiculous for a friggen hot dog and while they do have a good selection of sausages and dogs, it's well a wee bit of a rip off! i suppose we can make some allowances for them considering they're a local buisness and not a chain, and rent on mill ave must be a bitch to contend with, but still.  C'MON i will bump them up one star from my original 1 considering the previous factors and that they have a delicious Andouille sausage here; but i could probably buy six of them of better quality at Sprouts or Sunflower market.

Big thanks to Troy with A family Affair Pet Grooming, not only did he do an expertly and efficient job of grooming and cutting my dogs matted tangled curly dreds, he did it on the fourth of july! now that right there is an american ladies and gentlemen, willing to bust his chops on our nations b-day shearing my mountain goat of a dog when he should've by all rights been kicking it poolside w/ a beer and a brat. I dropped my pooch off yesterday at 9am and in a little over two hours he was all done, I didnt even recognize him when I saw him, he looked great, but decidedly less Jerry Garcia-esque (which is a good thing in my book) at any rate for $85 this is definitely my once a year go to guy for dog cuts. Take your furry friend for a car ride and drop by sometime, you wont be disappointed.

"I've been around this block twice now. Looking for something. A clue. I've been looking for clues and something led me back here. Yeah. So here I am. It could have been me, the one who was at Ringo's place when the shit went down. Hey. I know how it is. I've been there. We've all done bad things. We've all had those guilty feelings in our heart. I'm going to take your brain out of your head and wash it and scrub it and make it clean. I don't know. But I'm going to have to settle this. First we're going to check the grill and see what we can find. We're going to get nice and wet, and you're going to spread your buns. Oh, that's good. So you know me. You know my reputation. Thirteen inches of tough load, I don't treat you gently. That's right. I'm Brock Landers. So I'm going to be nice. So I'm going to be nice. So I'm going to be nice, I'm going to ask you one more time. Where the fuck is Ringo?"  Dirk: stands up and looks directly at a massive delicious sonoran dog wrapped in bacon with tomatillo salsa, cotija cheese, creamy guacamole, pico, and mustard. You are a star. You are star, You are a star, You are a star. You are a big, bright, shining star. That's right. "

Stopped in last night with the lovely Barbara G. for an evening of cocktails and dancing, and while we didnt do much dancing we certainly had an entertaining evening to say the least.  This was my second time visiting the Sidebar, and I have to say, my experiences were like night and day! Last night was the infamous sunday dance party. We mounted those stairs as the beat thumped and the DJ loomed at the top of the staircase like a monolith of sound, a pillar of electro non-chalance. It was a bit crowded and akward to get at the bar tenders with bodies loitering everywhere, a million side conversations chattering away, obscuring my pleas in a Cacophonous wall of noise. I am 6'4'' and with a jew fro mop of curls, i've never had a problem attracting a bar tenders gaze what with my inherent good looks and obvious desperation for liquor. Last night was different.  We stood there for a good 10-20 minutes it seemed before we were even acknowledged. A wandering door man "sans porte" approached us for our id's. I gave him mine, he slapped a wristband on me. Babs fumbled in her purse for hers but finally found it and she received her token of age verification. We waited. and waited. The door man came back and asked for our id's again. we flashed our wristbands. Finally a bar tender acknowledges my presence, i put in an order for a greyhound and a dirty martini, this was approx $12? My greyhound was a little weak w/ the voddy and heavier on the grapefruit than i'd have preferred but it was tasty none the less. Barbara's dirty 'tini was strong and delicious, *makes mental note*. We shouldered our way past the crowded dance floor and grabbed some seats on the very edge.  A rotund guy girated on the dance floor w/ the grace of an epileptic sea cow, and his crew sashayed and minced about him like moons or satellites stuck in his orbit. His red shirt and plump body and spastic movements entrapped my gaze, quite shaman like, and it wasnt long before I became nauseous and suggested we move away from his coterie of shameless ness. Unfortunately the dance floor grew bigger and his jerky movements propelled him nearer us yet again. I went to grab a tall boy of Pabst, momentarily abandoning Barbara G., to fend for herself. After what seemed an eternity, i'd secured another brew. I elbow my way back to Barbara, only to see her pained expression turn to relief, there happened to be a great spot on the couch opened up so i waved her over. We sat on the plush couches whispering to each other and sipping our cocktails, surverying the crowd. The people watching here was just stellar, so many characters: cool-aid sea cow ballerina and the spiders from mars, prince valliant with a curly lions mane of hair, the various dj's and hipster girls, and of course plenty of 'mo's out living it up.On the way out the wandering door man asked us for our ID's a 3rd time, but by then we were too tired to be annoyed. I had a great time and truly enjoyed myself, it might be a while before i come back to Sidebar on a sunday night but it's definitely worth a visit.  What with "Party Foul"/ Homme dead and gone, this seems to be your next best bet for a dance night at a really great bar.

Last night I dropped in with my brother. It was the first night in my new place in the Roosevelt, and my house is literally down the street, so I thought it'd be quite fitting to celebrate my successful move with an evening of classy cocktails at SideBar. As we mounted that now legendary staircase we saw a DJ warming up his station, and wicked deja vu entered my mind, "a repeat of sunday night?" NO, definitely not. While sunday night was enjoyable, Thursday night easily trumped it. We strolled in, and saddled up at the bar, straddling those funky chairs, and promptly ordered our drinks. A dirty martini for me. A dead guy for my little bro. The dirty tini was fabulous, I am so glad I remembered this from last sunday; it was poured heavy on the vodka, and shaken- not stirred. with a healthy skewer of 3 pimento olives. YUM! I nursed that baby like a newborn son. As happy hour neared close, much to our delight and surprise the bar tender announced it would be happy hour all night! I was as giddy as can be.  The art show they had going on at the time featured a local photographer, whose art has been on display the past month at some of my favorite haunts, Carly's namely. We chatted briefly regrding his and my favorite photos in his collection. Very talented and friendly guy, shame his name escapes me. After the tini, I was feeling hungry and thankfully the bar was stocked with pretzel bowls that I munched on continually.  All the while the DJ was spinning THE. MOST. badass playlist of 60's and 70's soul r&b and mo town classics. "..Just gimme some kinda sign girl! oh my baby! show me that your mine girl..." The stage was set for Sidebar to supplant all others as my favorite neighborhood bar, and I couldnt be more pleased. Sidebar, "If we start this fire, we'll burn the world to ashes..."

This place is so cool i was startled to find that Tempe has something like this It reminded me of the C.A.T. in Eugene. There are soo many bike parts, and tools, frames of all kinds from what i've learned is that you can pay a small sum and build your own bicycle here, or offer to volunteer and have your bike for free by working off the debt i came here a while back to see if they had anything of interest, and wouldnt you know it that on my way a nut and bolt fell off of my stirrup so i thought perfect, now i can get another the dude running the operation didnt charge me a thing so i left like a $1 in the tip jar it's such a priveledge to have something like this for the community, i just hope enough ppl reinvest their time into it so it can exist for generations of cyclists to come.

It's said that sometimes the best things in life are found when you're not looking for them, that is certainly true in the case of PastaBAR for me.  Late Saturday night after a few too many @ the Rose and Crown my brother and i attempted the brave the wait across the street for some pizzeria bianco, when we saw the closed sign we assumed this to be to our misfortune, little did we know what the universe had lying in wait for us. We rode back to his apt, in silence, famished and brooding we had no idea where to find some late night eats. Then, there it was, PastaBAR's marquee, like a beacon in the night we steered towards it's illumination like moths to flame. The sign on the door read: "open till 2am" we couldnt believe our eyes! Pushing those giant double doors open, we strolled inside, past an enthusiastic crowd gathered at the bar, our waitress ushered us to a lavish corner booth, whose padded seats were plush and amongst the most comfortable i've experienced in a restaurant setting. In a word the whole ambience of PastaBAR on a late saturday night was: Inviting. In no way did it seem an inconvenience to have come in so late, which i was truly afraid of. Our server saw us pondering over the menu and rescued us from our confusion. She explained the entire menu in very clear and concise terms, and with her help we quickly deduced what the best items suited for our tastes would be; my brother chose the gnocchi and I the orecchiette, along w/ some cold Peroni's to wash it all down. We sat nibbling on the thin italian bread sticks awaiting our dishes, and marveled at how much we adored this restaurant: their hours, their interior, their charming/beautiful/helpful servers, everything was shaping PastaBAR in our minds as the prime example of CenPho's burgeoning restaurant scene. 'Why aren't there more places like this!?' we thought. Finally our pasta bowls came out; two giant white porcelain troughs of fresh homemade pasta cooked w/ love and obvious skill. We sank our teeth into the pasta, devouring it greedily, and not once having envy toward the other's order, im fairly confident there was not once any offer to share amongst one another. The orecchiette was simply amazing, and my brother said the same of his gnocchi. When we got our check we were both more than happy to shell out whatever may have been the balance on the bill, i only hope i'd tipped our server enough! PastaBAR is without a doubt amongst my top three favorite restaurants in all of PHX and i will be sure to make my smiling face familiar amongst its long list of patrons.  I would truly encourage any and everyone to try it out!

"AY! HAAAAYYYYYYYY!! DUUUUDE. Where arrr youuu maaan! come to Turf me an Anthoneee are draaankin!" my brother slurred into the telephone.  "what? where are you?" I said confused and mildly entertained.    "TURFFFF!" he replied overly enthusiastically "We been drinkin' all morning duuude!" ensuing giggles and faint slurred speech is heard through the receiver as he and Anthony chortle with one another and assumedly forget they were on the phone.  "Hello?....uhh Hello?" I respond after a few moments ignored on the opposite end.   "HEY YO BOB!!!" a sloppy sounding anthony gargles into the phone, "Wherrre arrr yoo's! gedduh fugg down heer!"    "YEAYUH GET DOWN HERE!!" Justin echoes beamingly from the background.     I exhale a deep sigh, realizing how much liquor I'm gonna need to tolerate their company, "Dude, it's like 3 in the afternoon, you guys sound trashed..." I half heartedly say, to which they respond with giggling and more entreaties for my presence, "Okay I'll be there in 15."    When I stepped foot inside the Turf Bar, after enjoying a leisurely bikeride in the winter sunshine, I spot Justin and Anthony bellied up to the bar. They were unmistakable, and belligerently drunk, after a morning spent in various Irish bars in the downtown area. I cautiously walk over to them surveying the interior- mostly deserted except for a bemused barkeep and a few disinterested patrons enjoying a beer battered brunch of some sort. I strolled up behind them removing my wayfarers and smile, as I clasped their shoulders, they greeted me with the vivacity that only an overtly imbibed brother and good friend can. I could smell the stale reek of alcohol on them from a few feet away.   What followed was far too many rounds of liquor, and beer that could've pleased Andre the giant. We were warned by the bar tender to ease up on the profanity, my brother forgot to tip him, and Anthony rode on my bike handel bars most of the way home until Justin leapt at him T-boning the bike and flinging him onto the ground, they both laughed till they were red in the face. All in all I have to thank the Turf Bar for an interesting sunday afternoon that ended in my brother and his friend passed out on my front lawn and a brand new pair of my clothes with permanent grass and mud stains on them after angrily wrestling my brother into submission.

wow what a cool little place i adored it stopped in here for brunch on sunday? and it was a perfect experience other than being a little hot inside i ordered the andalusian toast for $2, delicious! this is what i would consider the pinnacle of toast the paragon of toast really i thought i was good at making toast i feel ashamed, and embarassed. The skill with which a couple of simple ingredients were combined to make such wonderful toast astounded me. I could go on and on really, I happen to love bread that much (not the 70's band of course). i also ordered some coffee for $2 all in all $5 for brunch, in a lovely little homey setting the owner/chef made you feel very comfortable and relaxed.  Its really cool how much Grand has changed over the years, Sapna is a great example of that change, and I hope other trepidatious small business owners take a lesson from Sapna. Do yourself a favour and stroll down Grand ave. sometime and hit up all the cool little shops and bars and restos, im sure you'll be pleasantly surprised. The only bad points of my experience were beyond Sapna's control: note- huge table of older yuppies behind me who were loud and judgemental, i vividly remember this one old douche exclaiming "excuse me but we were the first group here and the last to order!" to our sweet young little waitress, the look of embarassment and reticence on her face pained me, i couldnt help but think, 'Really? Really? cause i seem to recall your big group coming in AFTER me...but no no go ahead and complain please!'  love sapna and will gladly be coming back when they have more of that gypsy stew in stock!

one of the only safe havens on mill from the rampant and ferocious packs of yuppies, d-bags, greek life and all other forms of undesireables that frequent that short strip of put on commerce. My hatred for mill avenue aside; Hippie's Cove is a decent spot.  The new owners are pretty decent people that treat you right and have always done good by me; once drinking on their front stoop a disgusting little flying rat of a pigeon happened to shit smack dab into my pitcher of brew! incredulous i stared at the white gob of feces floating in my beer, as a street tramp chuckled and said it was 'good fortune to have a bird shit on you.' "well he didnt shit ON me rather in my beer!" i said exasperated, so i walk inside and show the owners son (methinks) and he laughs and gives me a free pitcher on the house! good man.   The food is generic chipotle/qdoba-esque mexican digs: not bad tasting and healthily proportioned but "run of the mill". My main reason for coming here is some cheap munchies, and the ice cold PBR on tap. no where else on mill ave (at least the short stip along campus), as far as i know, offers my favorite hillbilly hipster beer on tap, hell even the sail inn doesnt have Pabst on tap!   all in all if your on mill for whatever reason, avoid the trash and duck in here, you wont be disappointed!

I discovered this little Korean Market the other day after leaving LA Fitness, as they share a parking lot.  I was drenched in sweat and tired as a Cuban refugee who'd just swam to Florida. I shuffled into the market, dragging my feet searching for some form of sustenance.  Paldo Market is choc full of imported food stuffs, all kinds of Asian foods, processed and fresh. You could spend hours in the spice section, hell the whole store if you dont know what you're looking for; which is exactly what nearly happened to me.  I was entering the void, drifting off into that daydream space where your eyes glaze over and you dont even realize that you're staring off into the distance slack jawwed and drooling at the thought of kimchi fried rice, just then one of the owners? clerks? came up to me and asked me 'how my day was going' or something along those lines, i feebly looked at her and had to concentrate on just what she'd said she smiled hesitantly, scanning me quickly with her dark eyes, (probably wondering why i was drenched in sweat and dressed in hobo workout clothes) i smiled at her unable to really formulate a response. I looked around and wondered if i was brave enough to order any of the chilled salads they'd had in the freezer area, the spinach salad looked fairly good but for one reason or another all i ended up buying was some extra dark soy sauce, sriracha, and jasmine green tea, all for around $7. I noticed on the way out however that during the day you can order a meal and they'll cook it there, however no one was back near the kitchen when i was there and it looked closed. Next time i come here i will try and hydrate myself a little better so that im not ready to faint on the employees.

this place is so sooo cool! saw a comedy show here that was featuring local comedians, and boy were they sidesplittingly funny! better than half the crap stand up i see on comedy central sometimes. We smuggled some PBRs into the teatro and opened them with a "craack" and the comedian says "sounds like someone is having a good time!" i felt like a little kid who is too loud with his obviously store bought candy in the movie theatre and desperatly afraid the ushers will revoke his ticket. they didnt. its surprising that its in Tempe, and on Mill ave at that! our little city is growing some culture slowly but surely. my only hope is that they are around for a long time and that it wont just revert to an abandoned harkins like it was previously. so come on yelpers get out there and patronize the MADCAP! We need need need to keep local theatre alive, if ya dont use it ya lose it!

Taco tuesdays never looked so good! or tasted so good for that matter. The rumors are true, the hype is justified and the myth is in the making. SMG is what everyone says, and couldnt be more deserving of all the praises fellow yelpers have heaped onto them; they are ab-fab. From the second I walked in I was greeted with smiles and warmth, in fact throughout my meal I felt an extreme sense of deja vu, it wasnt until the ride home that I realized that the owner and my grandmother might in fact be long lost twins separated at birth! All kidding aside, the owner is one sweet little lady, talk about customer service oy vay! The Carne Asada? game over. Hands down the best in the valley. When I ordered my taco platter I didnt even specify what delicious type of meat I'd wanted, she looked at me, smiled, and knowingly suggested the carne asada, to which I heartily agreed.  The calibre of the food here is just incredible. So good that it could probably cure rascism. NO.JOKE. If sheriff joe ate here, he'd probably repent hole-heartedly, doubling down on his knees prostrating himself on the floor and weeping the sorry tears of a man whose seen his folly and begs forgiveness. I would challenge any white supremacist to eat here and say one bad thing about Mexico afterward. Sonora Mesquite Grill is the solution to Arizona's bad rap, sure we can produce ignorant rascist laws like SB-1070, but hey, we also have places like Sonora Mesquite Grill!  Sonora Mesquite Grill is The Jesus, and nobody fucks with the Jesus.

Okay, so I am not really sure if this is the same Salsitas I am accustomed to, But it is in Mesa so that is close enough.  Salsitas is unassuming enough, if you were to pass it going along your way minding your own buisness you might not even realize what a gem this tasty little place is. I sure didnt. One day at lunch break my buddy Jose and I are out on the search for a good burrito, we'd been burned previously by a competing little Taquería, Senor Taco- now La Palapa, but i digress. So wondering where to go for our measly 30 minute break, and running short on time I was getting desperate. Then Jose opines, "oh man they have a salsitas here!" So I jam on the e-brake and spin my 96 hyundai accent into a tailspin 180 degrees and jam on the pedal whipping it into the Salsitas parking lot. We climb out of the egg shaped vehicle and i slide across the hood dukes of hazard style and we trot into the joint. Straight up authentico feel to the place, not a whitey around and just some really smelly (in a good way) grub sizzling away, there is a sneeze guard but behind it you can see all the various types of meats they offer, from Carnitas to Pastor, I was in hog heaven.  We order two burritos de pastor, I get mine w/ guac, pico, and refriend pintos free of charge.  As we waited we sipped on horchata poured from a huge bucket, and labour over the salsa bar picking and choosing our condiments. The salsa bar is really, probably my favorite part. I always get some sliced raddish, pickled carrot, shredded cabbage, lime, salsa verde, and a few sliced cucumbers to supplement my already hulking burro. By the time we're done w/ the salsa bar, our burritos are finished and off we speed back to work.  As I'm typing this my fingers smell of garlic and spiced pork meat, my stomach is full, and my eyelids heavy.  Although the remainder of my day is hard to accomplish after my trips to salsitas I always leave satisfied. For under $5 you can grab a monster of a meal, that frankly isnt nearly as greasy or fatty as say Filly B's or that shit hole taco bell. I love salsitas and will continue to make my weekly pilgrimage.

Just as delicious as all the hype warrants, and impeccably clean. This is hangover food at its finest. Played hookey from work and came here with a rager of a headache, like a crippling debilitating hangover. Lo-Lo's put the kibosh on that noise real fast. The fried chicken is succulent and moist, the skin has the perfect texture of crunch and a savory spiced coating. Their signature homemade hot sauce is just the right accompaniment to the fried chicken and must needs be slathered all over the fried bird, leaving you, your table, and your face a hot mess. Again I have to reinforce how clean and tidy the place was, you'd think there would be grease and chicken bits all strewn about as hungry patrons devour their selections of fried chix but nuh-uh, spotless. Service was fast and friendly to boot. I have to mention that the waffles, while not anything especially great, were certainly not bad either, piping hot and fluffy, with a fat glob of butter and saccharinely sweet syrup they are what a decent waffle should be. I didnt get to try their famous red velvet cake, but hey, that's reason enough to come back for me.

True potential, that's what i see in Tempe Farmers Market. This little place has come a long way in a fairly short time. The concept is something i whole heartedly support, and while it may be a little pricier it's understandable. Like previous Yelpers have posted, it may not have every last item on your list, but it's a great place to augment your cooking w/ locally grown veggies & fruits, various cheeses, and artisan breads baked right here.  There's a lot of vegan options here as well, like that weird looking fake cheese you poor deprived souls consume. All in all it's a little local grocer that needs our support, and won't disappoint you if you invest you time and $$ into it, while all the products may not be produced in AZ a good deal of them are and it's not hard to tell.

While i agree with portions of the previous yelp i feel as though it was a little harsh -yes tiedemanns mayn't be the most spotless of local tempe thrifts; but it's certainly not the dirtiest, in fact it has a certain je ne sais quoi to it that i find lacking in other spots  -yes there is sparse organization; but there is always so much merch coming and going thruout the place it'd be impossible to keep it organized. you can drop in one day and find nothing that suits your fancy and the very next day an Accordion for $9.89 in great condition (true story) -the prices; dead on! the prices are nearly unbeatable all in all it depends on the day you go, and really thats what thrifting is all about. the hunt for the treasure that may or may not be hidden amongst all the piles of rubbish.

Ever had a piece of Broccoli that made you re-evaluate the vegetable entirely? Well I did, and I bought it from Phx Pub Mrkt. Beautiful verdant luscious dark green colour, crunchy savory and earthy, it even kept in my fridge far longer than I'd have figured an organic piece of Broccoli bought in an open air market should've kept. This broccoli made me a believer in this place. Nowadays I only shop for my seasonal fruits and veggies here, and the fact it's within walking distance from my shack only gives me further incentive. The market itself is not too big, they offer some hippie entrees at a lunch counter made by kids with tattoos and piercings and humble courteous faces. The veggies, fruits, and most of the merchanise is eihter a.)local b.)organic c.) expensive or d.)all of the above. However I love everything this market stands for and is trying to accomplish, I can only sing it's praises and shell money at it, hoping it grows into the little shop of horrors it was meant to be- with giant 7 foot anthropomorphized campy Little Richard like broccoli heads with a taste for blood and musicals.

Birds chirped in the sunshine, suv's full of well dressed brats in patent leather shoes and sunday finery were carted off to church, old folks sat on their porches with coffee and the Az republic, others gathered for brunch, more still awoke to Sunday morning broad casts and weekend chores- yet not Scott and I.  We rode down sixteenth street like mongols, drunk on pillage and homemade mimosas, the wind whipping our unkempt hair as we shouted curses at cars that sped by. The destination was uncertain, yet our buzz weened and the midtown lands loomed unfamiliar.   The canned wine we toted along on our trusty metal steeds had ran out and like a mirage, Rips Bar shimmered in the distance. We reared up and walked the mounts to the front door in attempts to find a sturdy rail to chain them to, a painter told us to check around the back entrance.  Stepping inside the dimly lit interior, there was only one crusty ancient drunk patronizing the bar, I scanned the digs of the place and grinned cuffing Scott on the shoulder.  "first round's on me" I croaked in a dry voice.  "word" Scott said deep and solemn.  We walked up to the bar and bellied up on stools, as the voluptuous bartender sauntered over. She gave us both a look up and down and in a sultry husky voice inquired "what'll it be?". Scott asked her if they had any seasonal specials, and she rattled off a few and declared that bloody mary's would be the special of note. I ordered one and Scott opted for a domestic draft. I traded a dollar for some quarters and headed over greedily to the galaga machine, I planned to out do the best score.   Out of the corner of my eye I watched as the rockabilly bartender made my bloody, aghast I stiffled a gasp. In revulsion I watched in horror as she took several jars of some pickled substance or other and sloughed some of the brine into my glass, I shuddered.  If there is one form of food that I despise and almost pathologically fear it is pickled anything. Since the days of my childhood when my younger brother would chase me around the house with a half eaten pickle in his outstretched hand and giggle as he tormented me, I have always hated them.   I resigned myself to the fate that awaited me. I told myself 'how gross could it be? I've had hundreds of bloody mary's before, surely someone has made one akin to this and I probably didnt even realize.' Man up! I thought.  Even still I felt condemned. Soon she would place it before me, and I'd gingerly sip and make a face and she'd know how big of a wuss I am and I'd never be able to come to this awesome biglebowski-esque bar ever again.   My hands trembled and grew damp as I lost round after round on Galaga, attempting to forstall the inevitable, finally my quarters were spent and I turned to face my trial.  I closed my eyes, and held my breath, as I took a long pull from the glass and swallowed quickly. What hit me first wasnt the putrid taste I had thought would overwhelm me, in fact there wasnt anything putrid about it, what hit me was the amount of vodka in my glass, like someone shattered that glass on the crown of my skull. It was salty, and viscous, and strong like bull. It was spicy and tart and peppery. It was tangy and sweet and sour all at once. It was probably the best dive bar bloody mary I had ever had, and I was pleasantly surprised.    Sitting out on the porch with a smoke and my half full glass for company as Scott tittered on with the one grizzly patron inside, I felt warm and content, and I vowed never to let appearances deceive me again, lest I miss out on some salty new experience.

Ah college dropouts while this place is not as successful as say kanye, paul allen, or william faulkner i would chance to say that i enjoy it just as much as the previous 3 drop outs i mentioned. This place is such a little gem, and i found it quite by accident. There is a lot of appeal, and now all it really needs is a loyal following, please join me as i try to make this happen lol. seriously though; cheap PBR, an old skool NES w/ several great games including Ninja Turtles and Mario, no duck hunt 8-( a pool table, a fooseball table, some giant plinko contraption, clean bathrooms and  a nice smoking balcony. its all here. occasionally even some live music. Plus its right off of mill so you can save yourself some grief from the stereotypical tempe douches that infest the short walk.  the only pitfall is that its usually pretty sparse in here, but hey it wont be if you go and bring yer mates, so cheers catboys!

this has been a long time coming, but without further ado:   I met her in a coffee shoppe down in old CenPho Where you drink caffeine and it tastes just like cherry-cola C-O-L-A cola  She walked up to me and she asked me to pay I asked her her name and in a DARK BROWN voice she said Lola  L-O-L-A Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola   Well I'm not the world's most physical guy  But when the coffee burned my mouth I nearly broke my book's spine  Oh my Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola  Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand  Why my barrista walked like a woman and talked like a man  Oh my Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola   Well we drank chai lattes and danced all night  Under electric candlelight  She picked me up and sat me on her knee  And said little boy won't you come home with me  Well I'm not the world's most passionate coffee drinking guy  But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola  Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola  Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola   I pushed her away  I walked to the door  I fell to the floor  I got down on my knees  Well I looked at her and she at me   Well that's the way that I want it to stay  And I'll always want it to be that way for my Lola  Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola  Girls will be boys and boys will be girls  It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola Coffee  Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola   Well I'd left home just a week before  And I'd never ever drank a quad shot latte before But Lola smiled and took me by the hand  And said little boy I'm gonna make you a man   Well I'm not the world's most masculine man  But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man  And so is Lola  Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola  Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola

I Love Cartel. I have been a fan for years now, and I sincerely believe in this homegrown business. Their coffee tastes great and their locations, whether the flagship in Tempe, the nook in the Sky Harbor, or this one downtown are always very hip and fashionably constructed in minimalist style. The entire aesthetic of their business is very well put together, even down to the littlest touches like the design of their plastic cups. I dare say I've never had a better cold brewed coffee than their toddy, it's smoky and robust and complex and powerful. The only possible complaint I have is that this location closes rather early.

adjectives that come to mind when someone suggests TMI: charming. quaint. refurbished. amiable.  TMI represents the burgeoning scene of cenpho well, and caters to the ethos that other hip local business owners in our city have come to adopt: namely- rennovate, restore, refurbish, resurrect. the four R's with that in mind TMI has succeeded head over heels. They've taken something great and improved on it, and stuck to a method that is key for success. The surrounding environs of 7th st seem to hone in on something, something hard to define, but when i go to places like the coronado cafe, the main ingredient ale house, the roosevelt, carlys- they all say to me: "Phoenician Renaissance" For as long as your are around, and lets hope its generations, i will frequent you TMI, and i will bring along droves of friend/foodies to further sing your praises. delicious sandwiches, salads, and an amazing beer list. a great spot for calling off of work and enjoying a lazy day.

i've always been a fan of the pita jungle franchise. whether it's their Chandler location, and their fantastic servers, or the Tempe locale and their easy access along the lightrail corridor- pita jungle is usually a sure fire bet. I've been watching the progress of their dwn twn location for a good couple months now and anticipating the days when i could leisurely stroll down 3rd ave and grab myself some of their tasty treats. When they finally opened i was pleased. It wasnt until last night however that i actually stopped in for a bite. around 9 o'clock pm they have their reverse happy hour, a great time to drop in catch some drinks and wash them down with their tapas; an assortment of their appetizer items that you can order for anywhere from $1 - $3 per tiny plate, and generally due to my cheap and stingy nature anything under $5 i am a big fan of. sampling delicious appetizer items ranging from their spanish style "gambas al ajo", to the yummy hummus concoctions to potato infused garlic dip, dolmades, mozarella tomato and basil with balsamic, to their falafel you can really load up and get a feel to the swagger they portend. Our server was cute, friendly, and charmingly alt. if not a little unsure of the menu she was perky and willing to find all the answers to our various questions regarding the menu. after all was said and done my brother and i had shared several plates of tapas and left quite satisfied with a meagre bill of only $16. Pita Jungle is a great option to the late night foodie scene of downtown, a def. stop.

"Dark in the city, night is a wire Steam in the subway, earth is a fire..." She swayed languidly, as her hips gyrated in a seductive and carnal manner most unbecoming of her age, "Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do" while human sexuality has no age cap- her guttural languorous dance proclaimed her wanton desire for every ripe male drop of lust she could glean. "Woman you want me, give me a sign And catch my breathing even closer behind Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do..." The tempo of the live band increased, as the staccato and drunken attempts at dancing of the desperate middle aged men in the room filtered onto the small dance floor. "In touch with the ground I'm on the hunt i'm after you.." The unbridled passions of the room intermingled on the dance floor as we stared in revolted awe, like a train wreck we scoffed at the hook ups that were just kindling, and those now fomenting to completion. As another pitcher of cheap domestic beer arrived at our table, we greedily drank the sudsy tincture and stared questioningly at the bacchanal in progress. "Smell like i sound, i'm lost in a crowd And i'm hungry like the wolf..." As the band would calm, so too would the mating rituals of the patrons, suggesting some proportional relationship between the two. In my clouded thoroughly drunk brain I thought to myself the nature of that formula and deduced it to be congruent with the amount of drink imbibed. "Straddle the line, in discord and rhyme I'm on the hunt i'm after you..." Now the atmosphere and liquor had worked its spell upon us, we rose to our feet, compelled by the news that this was to be the mediocre blues bands last cover song, zombielike we made our way to the empty dance floor "Mouth is alive with juices like wine And i'm hungry like the wolf..." As we danced in utter ridiculous parodied fashion, the revelers were drawn to our presence like moths to flame, they sought any excuse to continue their rituals, and ensure themselves a partner in the darkness of the night, and cougar claws came out as they vied for their kills. "Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do...."

In a two day span, I frequented this monument to lard, not once, but twice; making Federico's my defunct dinner for two days in a row. How did this happen? Why did this happen? These were questions I woefully pondered as I spent nearly 3/4 of a sunday perched upon the porcelain throne, evacuating my bowels like Anderson Cooper and his news crew amidst a chaotic Tahrir square.  The only reason to my madness, that I could fathom, in the clouded and reeking haze I was brewing that sabbath day, was that I had literally drank or smoked myself retarded- so much so that my ravenous appetite overwhelmed my better judgement. Friday night, my mistake was assuming that the graveyard shift would care enough to properly cook an Adobada burrito at 2 am. It honestly tasted like they doused some chorizo in red chili sauce wrapped it in a tortilla and threw it out the delivery window like an unwanted baby in bath water. Saturday night for one idiot reason or another I ordered a green chili burrito, which I'd assumed would be hard to fuck up, apparently not. This didnt taste like green chili pork, perhaps It'd be more apt to label it as "boiled pork offal with a splash of tomatillo salsa" it was proabably the worst green chili i've had in a long while. Sunday, Montezuma claimed his bloody revenge on this descendant of Spanish immigrants (had this angry aztec spirit bothered to scan my family lineage on ancestry.com he'd have realized that the spanish on my mothers side is hardly large enough to exact vengeance for atrocities committed by cortez and his cronies in the 16th century, but who am I to question undead central american monarchs) ahem. Lets just say I dont enjoy prolonged bathroom visits and this is what Federico's translates to in my vernacular.

As I am not a Tempe native, or really even a true phoenix native i cannot claim to truly appreciate the Long Wong's legacy, nor can i hold dear any thoughts of past LW's locations famous and infamous alike.So, I like to think that my view of their new locale along the light rail's snaking path is, a relatively unbiased view of the place. Last night we rode our bikes thru the cool humid night air and damp streets- across the deserted campus and to the sheltering arms of L.W.'s; the bands were setting up and the rains were slowly receding. The chattering youths and hip older crowd all merged in the bustle of a night of music, food, and the camaraderie of shared experiences in beer and music. Faces emerged known and yet to be met, as the rounds were made. After countless domestic drafts, all at moderate prices, and cigarettes puffed in the rain; the natural response was hunger! I ordered: a chicken quesadilla for only $3.50! The wings here are supposedly legendary, not being a wing man myself, i did however, witness a wing eating competition; in which my friend won. The ambience of the place was great! It was hard to leave! The rains poured and my soggy bike was the only means of transporting my wretchedly drunk and tired flesh back to the harbour of my home. I really enjoyed this new L.W.'s location as a good little venue, with ample room, and a small parking lot as well. It's a place that can accomodate a large spectrum of revellers and I will gladly be coming back any time.

Your first soiree into Peruvian cuisine should be nowhere else in the valley, this little joint across the street from GCC is one of my favorite haunts. Its a shame i live in Tempe as this is a bit outta my way 8-( But, first off lets discuss the service: Gregarious? is the word im looking for...umm.. how about: expressively helpful and outgoing? That sums it up pretty much.  I stepped into el Rincon Peruano w/ my one of my best friends and My ex-GF, as my bff is the son of Peruvian immigrants, he was my sherpa and guide into this tasty realm of incan andean delights. We started off w/ appertizers of Ceviche. delicious, fresh, acidic and mouth watering! and relatively cheap. we also got these toasted little corn nuggets whose name escapes me but they were also the bomb shiz. My bff ordered a Peruvian style Tamale, and los Anticuchos.They both looked amazing! he gobbled up the Tamale, so idk how it tasted but it looked and smelled like a treat. The Anticuchos were peices of meat skewered and assumably grilled and coated in a red colour. He greedily ate most of them but offered the Ex-GF and i a hearty (no pun intended) chunk of the meat. Now had my spanish been as good as it was in Highschool i would've been hesitant to try this, thank god it wasnt because this was one of the most delicious pieces of meat i have ever eaten! As we were chomping away on the Anticuchos he says: "those are beef hearts! bahahah" and she and i look at each other, a pained, nervous and guilty look on her face, and a momentary flash of reserve on mine.  I ordered a huge platter of bistec con papas i believe it was called, essentially a huge slab of steak with big fries and rice beans and a fried egg, while she ordered a tamale. My dish was absolutely delicious and the perfect hangover food, to wash it all down we ordered a litre of inca cola- a golden limey coloured soda that is indescribably wonderful. We left el rincon peruano, humbled, happy, and bloated, and i am looking forward to feeling that huge again!

Regrettably I was here a few months back for a friend's birthday, and while the vehemence of my disdain has been allowed to cool with the ensuing time since my visit, I now know with a particular level of certainty why you shouldn't waste any of your hard earned benjamin's here. -crowds: granted it is in the Biltmore, so your bound to be surrounded with yuppies, however if you truly analyze the setting of this restaurant it's essentially an option in a food court of a pretentious mall masquerading as something else. lets be fair though, most places in Az are in some form of strip mall setting, but in all honesty isnt the Biltmore just another shopping mall? -rude servers: now there is any number of reasons why a server has the right to be a little curt, I'm not saying that a server needs to be a ball of sunshine to satisfy me, but open hostility, resentment, and referring to one of my friends with a pretty strong homophobic slur is in my eyes unacceptable. -inflated prices: $10 for a burger? to quote Wayne's World "SHUHHH" NO WAY!? WAAAY." There'd be no complaints to that price tag if the burger was actually worth it, what your paying for is what my Peruvian friend's realtor mom likes to call "Locacion, Locacion, Locacion" -mediocre burgers: along the lines with the last comment, the burgers here are surely "meh, i've had better" 2 stars at best. For a pricier burger that you'll be glad to shell out a hamilton and a few washingtons for go to Phoenix City Grille, now they know how to make a burger and treat customers Simply put Zinburger has no Zen, and it leaves you with the same taste in your mouth that a haiku written by George Carlin might.

god i really really don't know what to give the duce as i am writing this spiel im still considering... okay okay pros and cons easy way to make up my mind pro: -favorite old timey domestic beers available for $3 a pop -great food -awesome concept -a real playground for adults cons: -bermuda triangle/wormhole/vortex/blackhole telephone booth -trying to be everything at once well despite being trapped in their vintage phone booth, abandoned by my carefree and ambivalent yelp friends and rescued by two chuckling meat head types who proceeded to deride my foolishness at getting locked inside a confined space and then panicking like a lost child separated from his overbearing jewish mother in a crowded wal-mart shopping center, i still happen to think that the pro's vastly outweigh any con you could dream up for the Duce.  and ya know what boom 5 stars.

Verde/ Vert/ zelenyee doesnt matter how you say it; green carries many connotations in the mind. whether it be envy, nature, ralph nader, or mean joe, "verde" brings to mind many things. All that changed for me when i experienced CenPho's verde on saturday morn. My world was rocked, a sea change had come and with it a paradigm shift in what i associate the word verde with: from now on verde for me will mean delicious. Palo Verde trees now make me hungry... After a long nights revels this last first friday i awoke to a blinding headache and pained back from a restless sleep on concrete with a gnawing hunger that could propel a lesser man to rob a chinese take out at gunpoint. We roamed the streets towards the saturday market, the vendors were just settling in, and the food options- while all nice in their own way, couldn't dispell the ravenous hunger that plagued me. we settled for coffee and cigarettes, but those only distracted us for so long. We espied the token line surrounding Matt's Big and pondered whether we could withstand the wait. And then it hit us, a slight breeze and with it the smell of fresh tortillas and meat cooked in a wood burning stove feuled by mesquite. We headed towards the aroma, our nostrils our guides. We ambled into Verde like refugees. I ordered a $5 breakfast burrito of green chili pork pinto bean and egg. Biting into this plump and delicious burrito was like a first kiss. sparks flew, i was in love; smitten with the savory goodness that radiated happiness and nourishment throughout my body. It seemed criminal to have only paid $5 for something so delictible!

any thrift store that is a converted old house, full of treasures, and will sell you a vintage bolo tie for $2 and leather oxford shoes for $12 is a must stop shop for me. The dude who works here was a really nice guy, there is enough goodies here to keep you occupied for an hour or two. I got the impression it was an "alternative" kinda place, but no bother, they'd be able to tell you if your shoes match your belt and such and such  diggi do: come check out 3 snaps.

The best tattoo parlor in phoenix.This place embodies everything about the rising entrepreneurial spirit that has been flourishing for the past couple of years in our little fledgling arts district.   Jason, co owner and the artist I was lucky enough to book, is a bonafide artisan and down right the nicest tattoo artist to ever work on me. I can't recommend Golden Rule enough, it's all in a name; these guys practice what they preach.  I dropped in on a saturday as soon as they opened and already there was a crowd gathering, I had anticipated that but I was a little naive in assuming I could get in the same day. Apparently he was booked for the next couple of months! However I reminded him of an email I had sent earlier in the week and I showed him a sketch of what I wanted, he immediately remembered and set me up for a 3:00 appointment.   I rode my bike home and passed the hours eagerly awaiting my allotted time with the master. fast forward to 3 o'clock and I get back a litttle early, their day was a frantic break neck speedy barrage of window shoppers, serious dedicated customers, drunk tourists, you name it. For some reason it seems everyone walking down Roosevelt is drawn to GR's parlor, frequently interrupting artists with inquiries and phone calls, which while good for business is pretty effing annoying when window shoppers come in to ask stupid questions right in the middle of the dude's work. I digress. Jason handeled it all deftly and joked and made me at ease despite the frequent interruptions. The end result was exactly, I mean to a t, what I wanted and I'm so immensely pleased.   Hopefully my next visit here will go just as smoothly but I now know, book that shit in advance and save you and the artist some heartache.

Happy Buffet should change their name to happy 420 buffet, cause they are a stoner's paradise. a gajillion different options, and all of which were delicious and not greasy in the least! I walked in the door with my best friend, who resembles the most accurate real life depiction of james franco's character in Pineapple Express, and we were shocked to see almost no one inside! It was a buffet ghost town! sad news for the owners, great news for my belly! I shoveled lbs of tasty grub into my craw! plate after plate, the few people working there smiled uneasily as I'd gotten up and waddled to the buffet for my third go round. coconut shrimp, pork shumai, drunken chicken and mushrooms, garlic string beans, crab legs, you name it, it was probably there. As I finally reached my breaking point, I thought of Adam Richman, and my loathing for him turned to a begrudging understanding, I'd fought that buffet with a relentless intensity that only his fat sweaty brow could fathom, and I'd won. A quick victory lap to the soft serve machine and we left conquerors like two young mongols after the sacking of some prosperous northern chinese village.  When I got home I looked in the mirror to survey the damage done, I resembled a starving ugandan child with skinny limbs and bloated stomache, only I wasnt starving I was sickeningly full!  Come to Happy Buffet and be prepared to make a cow of yourself! USA!!USA!!USA!! godblessamericalandthatilovestandbesideherandguideherwithahmmsomethingsomethingfromabove!!

I am hesitant to even review JoBot Coffee. It's one of those situations where I'm caught in a catch 22: i want their business to flourish, but i want it to remain sparse and not overpopulated with d-bags. however they need the publicity and support so i will go ahead and sing my praises. JoBot for me, reprsents Israel. Now hear me out on this one Goyim:   If Phoenix is a metaphor for the world, and people like me, i.e. stylish intelligent cultured 20 something yr olds supposed hipsters persecuted as such a metaphor for the diaspora of jewish peoples than JoBot coffee would be our zion. You look about and as far as the gates of their partially sheltered courtyard extend you will see nothing but my peoples, heads bowed in solemn respect that denote caffeine addiction and apple computer usage, the cool kids vonnegut readers, cigarette tokers, friends of vegan and pescatarian alike. This place is my canaan in a fiesty world of jack boot goose stepping fascists in lifted trucks and tribal tattoo arm bands who'd just as soon shout a slur at me on my bike or rocket off a monster energy drink at the back of my head. JoBot is my shelter from the storm. and i sincerely hope it remains that way.

FilmBar fulfills a much needed niche for CenPho's cinema lovers, as well as a very interesting option to the area's bar scene.  I found myself excused from my astronomy class early on their opening night, after my weak ass professor canceled lab, and I swiftly realized that instead of star gazing I would actually be able to attend their much anticipated opening night. The digs are really swank, the interior is even nicer than I imagined it would be, and the atmosphere is really enthusiastic. They have a fully stocked bar, and a really great brew list to boot: Lagunitas IPA's for $4 and PBR's at $2. The movie showing that night was an interesting documentary about two comedians in North Korea, I sipped on my IPA as I watched and enjoyed the plushness of the vintage theatre seats.  The screening room is set up with rows of theatre style bucket seats and there are a few tables with chairs in the back. The Bar area is divided between a lounge with cushioned and inviting seating, and the bar proper, replete with sultry lighting and sexy bar staff. I am so glad that they've finally opened, and I really just cant wait till I can come back and enjoy another visit. Harkins and AMC can kiss my white ass!  !VIVA LE FILMBAR!

The four of us were piled in my brothers car, I grabbed shot gun, as I'm instinctively want to do, quickly plopped into the passenger seat, only to have my little sister backhand the crown of my skull from the rear seat.  "Let Mom sit there dick!" she said peevishly  "Whose birthday is it again?" my brother chimed in.  I let out a groan and climbed out, my mother and I exchanged positions. She sat down next to my brother in the front, as I cast a sidelong glance at my sister.  "SO! Where are we going?" My mother asked impatiently.   "It's YOUR birthday, where do you feel like eating??" I asked annoyed.  "Oh I don't mind, where do you kids feel like eating?" My brothers knuckles tightnened on the steering wheel, my sister and I exchanged glances and rolled our eyes. We three knew this could go on all night, and the further we pushed her the more she wouldnt budge. I knew personally that the blame would fall on me. Being I am the oldest, and the birthday dinner/movie was my idea. I scrambled in my brain cataloging the bookmarks of places I thought she might deign to eat at. "FEZ? Maybe FilmBAR aftertward..?" Weeks earlier I'd made this suggestion to which she responded enthusiastically; and true to her nature, the day her birthday rolls around she's completely forgotten we even spoke about this. I began the routine again.  "Fez?" I ask. My sister groans, my brother is silent.  "Mmmmm nah.." my mother mused.  "How about Durants, we could..."  "OH NO NO!! Too expensive!" she said in abject horror cutting me short.  "Whaat..? No they're not.." my brother pleaded my case, he obviously wanted steak.  "Yeah!" I concurred almost getting offended "I could buy us all filet mignons and a bottle of red wine for under $100!!" I boasted.  "No you couldnt." my mother said defiantly. We argued over the price of steak at full volume, my mother screeching at me from the front seat, my brother pivoting his head and joining in. My sister stared out the window until she was just too annoyed to contain her silent fury, a friday evening wasted with her brothers and mom was almost too much to bear.   "LETS JUST DRIVE UNTIL WE FIND A PLACE" she commanded in an imperious voice unfitting of a 14 year old girl. We drove on in silence, passing one good restaurant after another as the street numbers climbed higher and higher. I was quickly outta my element. We came up to 56th st. and The 56 Kitchen stood out like a neon monolith, hewn from rock by the brawn  and sweat of men long dead, it stood there in the distance like it was born to host our evening repast. We all knew, without saying, that this would be our destination. My brother pulled up the car and we wordlessly agreed and filed into the restaurant like a mock execution.  The 56 Kitchen. I'd never heard of it, not even the merest bleep on Yelp, yet here it stood. I wondered afterward how a place so tasty could be so far off my radar, it wasnt even, to borrow that piece of shit Guy Frieri's phrase, a 'diner, drive-in, or dive'.   We all ordered like champions, ironically only my Mother's dish wasnt very good. We started with appetizers of "drunk bread" and some hot cakes with pulled pork. The hot cakes were a def. crowd pleaser, the "drunk bread" was..interesting, and while not bad, was...eccentric.  I ordered an "Arcadia Pie", a tasty artisan style thin crust with leeks, bacon, and big dollops of ricotta. My brother ordered a bowl of housemade Pepperdelle style pasta with a creamy pork gravy. My sister opted for the house mac 'n cheese with a side salad. Mum ordered a pizza that my lil' sis' described as a "totino's frozen pizza", underwhelming but tasty and edible none the less. We ordered beers and sat and leisurely enjoyed our meals, sharing from one anothers plates, I ended up eating most of everyones, and even finishing off my brothers pasta in the car, his dish was the obvious winner. When the dust settled the damage came to about $90 some odd dollars. Mother let out a hyperbolic gasp, and I nearly had to find smelling salts, bro and I split the bill down the middle and we all drove back home.

For our only official comedy club in the downtown area it's definitely not bad. They draw some big names and without a doubt you will have a good time and laugh your tooshey off.   Having said that; the food isnt anything special, the drinks are pretty lame and there is a two drink minimum, the prices are severely gouged.  I understand they need to turn a profit and I don't begrudge them this, but you won't catch me eating or drinking here, 'cept for maybe a Mr.Pibb.  S'Go.

With the recent arrival of the Foundry on First to downtown, we can proudly proclaim yet another great venue to our burgeoning music scene. What an ideal venue this is too! The grounds are sprawling and massive, with two bars; one for beer and the other for spirits. The place is divided up between a large dancefloor and a balcony area with lounge seating.  Saturday my entourage and I made our way there for the first time, and although the whole cast wasnt in tow, we still managed to have a rip roaringly good time at The Foundry. When we first arrived we shelled out a tenner and got our wrist bands then made our way inside, past droves of cigarette toking hipsters posturing hard to retain an air of apathy around their peers. I was unabashedly excited grinning like an idiot most of the night, because I knew two of my favorite local acts were headlining that night, Mergence and What Laura Says. We bought drinks, the lovely Barbara G. and myself opting for vodka and red bulls as we were both a little drowsy, Scott and Katie going straight to hopville with two sudsy pints.   This is where I have to voice my one complaint. The cocktails Barbara G. and I ordered had to have been a ratio of 4 parts mixer 1 part vodka and at $9 plus tip I felt like I'd been boned. We both sipped our weak drinks disappointedly, and grumbled, reminding one another to avoid spirits on our next go round. The pints of beer were also a little disappointing, for two reasons- one. the best beer offered was kilt lifter, two. they came in plastic cups. This is one of my biggest pet peeves, and while I understand the reasoning (not wanting to have any broken glass and or ensuing legal problems arise from said broken glass) I just cannot stand drinking beer from a plastic cup. SO long story short just pregame it on riot punch before you head to the Foundry and you should be keen for the night, and your wallet will thank you in the morning.  The Foundry is in a sweet spot downtown, just a block or so south of US Airways Center, it's conveniently located around other pubs and close light rail access and the various other draws DwnTwn has to offer. Hopefully the Foundry will be around for a long time yet, and it will be just one more great reason for people to come visit and spend their hard earned dollars in our lovely city.

A late night, we drove all over town. I sat in the back cramped smoking cigarettes and complaining. Polo seemed miserable, it was the end of the line. The birthday extravaganza had lasted all day, and we ravished restaurants and bars alike, gorging ourselves like a saturnalia, our bacchanal brotherhood of drugs and drink and food had led us to Raising Canes. It seemed appropriate enough a name. We went through the drive-thru and made jokes and weird noises to the attendant who luckily didnt molest our food. We sat in the parking lot and cracked open some tallboys from qt and devoured our chicken. Scott ever the gentlemen shared his with me, and I gotta say; this is a chicken that can easily rival chic-fil-et or howeverthehellyouspellthat. Gays, liberals, floozies, dopers, commies, hippies, beats, drunks, your all welcome at Cane's! It's like the immortal billy joel once said "i'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints".

The shop was shutting down for the summer, outside temperatures raged in the triple digits but inside the hipster buzzards picked over the remnants of the shop's merch like bloodthirsty carrion, tearing and clawing at the scraps of vintage rags with a greedy abandon. I awkwardly shuffled about with a smirk on my face, musing to myself at the scene. I'd been dragged here by two young women whom I'd recently considered renting a house with, and after a day spent real estate browsing in the summer's swelter the ladies needed a brief respite to shop. Thankfully the store's owners had anticipated gentlemen such as myself and had supplied the shop with a relatively comfortable couch for me to sit and wait upon.   It didn't take long for me to find what I wanted, as I assume most men shop I immediately spotted the few gems amongst a sea of recycled clothes and fashion ephemera of days gone by. In this little closet boutique you'll find a veritable sea of ladies items and a few racks of mens clothes cordoned off to a side corner. I managed to find an old levi's jean jacket at half off, probably won't get to bust that out until the end of November but I anticipate that with glee. I also managed to spot a King Crimson tee shirt with the howling face of their 1969 debut album's cover emblazoned across the front, the store's owners had safety pinned a handmade price tag on the collar with a misnomer label "Pink Floyd's the Wall T" chuckling to myself I decided I'd use it as a bookmark later.   The ladies shopped for what seemed like hours and I played with the daughter of one of the girls to pass the time, feeding her a cheerio one at a time as she desperately pawed at my neon orange fanta bottle. The whole store being half off I knew we'd be there a while as the girls sifted through the goods, I day dreamed about the Karmann Ghia parked in the lot out front, doomed to live out it's days as a mere marketing piece advertising the store. I empathized with that car, I imagined how it had lived out its youth probably speeding down the pacific coast highway only to languish in idle retirement as a show piece for the shop it was betrothed to, and in a way I suppose that's how a lot of us end up. Is it better to burn out, careening off the cliffs of life's pacific coast highways or to fade away in the parking lot's of sunny strip malls? Perhaps I'll never know

Independent book stores are a dying breed. For every Apple fanboy tech-slave you see reading an iPad, another book store dies. Just think about that for a while, a brief moment of silence please, light a candle, waft some incense. Did it sink in yet? This is the only book store in the downtown Phoenix area, and as a defacto you'd expect it to be subpar, it is not. The selection may not be the broadest, but it's ecclectic and kitschy. An old American Craftsman with a long and storied history damn near as entertaining as the stories purveyed within. The staff is usually quite young but knowledgeable and friendly, more than willing to help you track down what you're after if they have it. More so than just a bookstore this place is host to various activities you'd be hard pressed to find elsewhere, poetry slams, outdoor BYOB movie nights with such features as Army of Darkness. Check out their event calendar and give them a visit, unless of course you just really don't care about the plight of the endangered indie bookstore.

An adorable little mum n' pa hole in the wall shoppe.  It's situated right next door to one of my oldest friend's apartment complex, so we definitely get our breakfast fix here whenever I crash on his couch. The owner's are a really nice cheerful little minnesotan-esque couple that is happy to stuff you silly with their tasty treats and sweeties. My best bud being a rather rotund and convivial man always gets his sweet tooth fix here and I definitely can't blame him, all their little chocolates and pastries just look downright gorgeous. I'm more partial to savoury flavours myself so I opt for breakfast sandwiches they offer that are served with their very own house made ciabatta and a thick cut pepper smoked bacon that just typing about is making me salivate- what's more is they were more than willing to accomodate me and make it mayo-less as I rushed back in to modify my order in a near panic when I realized it came with it. Can't wait to get back here and scoop up some bon bons for me dear ol' Ma.

The raison d'etre of Yelp is to spread the gospel of local businesses like International House of Food. This little spot is a gem, tucked away on Van Buren in the shadow of the downtown skyline. The menu is large and aims to please a variety of palates. The prices are a steal considering how delicious and home cooked the food is, serivce congenial and amicable, and the interior itself is spotless and comfortable.  This morning I dropped by with my special lady friend for breakfast, around 7:00, and we were the first customers, we ordered a battery of items to get a good idea of the spread: a waffle combo- one waffle two eggs a slice of bacon and a sausage link; a taco plate- one pastor, one asada, and a chorizo taco with rice, beans dusted in cotija, a side of grilled onions and some homemade tomatillo salsa; as well as a bowl of peanutty pad thai teeming with tofu, chicken, scallions, and eggs. It was a glorious repast, and insanely affordable.   I can't recommend International House of Food enough, and I'm happy to say that this won't be my last visit. A solid option and a boon companion to the downtown restaurant scene, may they live long and prosper!

Two fleets of 6 6oz beer tastings, a stolen slice of pizza, and a drunken hastily written flirtatious note to the waitress later and I am Angel's Trumpet Ale House newest fan.  Expect to see a lot more of this ugly mug, cause ATAH- you're on notice!

This place is legit. Stopped by to get a new bowl for my "water pipe", and couldn't be more pleased.  All their pieces are made by local Arizona glass blowers, and they are apparently a talented bunch. The intricate designs and little aspects of my bowl really make it stand out and catch your eye.  What's more is they offer my favorite blend of american spirit cigarettes and at a cheaper rate than circle jerk.  I checked in using my yelp app and also got 20% off of my purchase, what's not to love? Don't pass up this joint bud.

This is a temple to hair and the artistry that accompanies the craft of manipulating it, I drink it's kool-aid and attend mass every few months, purging me of the dreaded locks that grow weed like from my skull. My friend Jorge has carved his mark upon Phoenix with a shop that I've tried to turn all my friends and family onto like a proselytizing shlub. My lil sis and my dear ol ma have both been shorn and could easily attest to his skills, and their hair is some thick nappy shiz. This dude is a well learned acolyte in the secrets of a master trade. Deft and swift, skilled with scissors and blessed with a keen eye. Merely a few words communicated and he already has an image formed in his mind, and I can relax with a chill beer in the cloister of the stone walls and wood beams, nestled in a vintage chair, lulled by the endless tracks of music i've never heard but always known somehow that ebb and flow into one another seamlessly. I always walk away like a new man, refreshed and confident and pleased with the new do.   It's a great feeling when you have the right guy for the right job, be it barber, mechanic, barista  it's an understanding and a trust thing you don't want your mane in the wrong manhands ya dig?

In a quiet unassuming little slump block building lays the greatest kept secret in all the Phx metro area, a sleeping dragon coiled and ready to dominate this town with an array of delicacies that bar comparison to any chinese restaurant this side of San Francisco. Miu's is leagues above any of it's competitors in Phoenix, simply put they are the best. The dishes offered are overtly authentic, with flavors that beguile and transform expectations, since I ate here I cannot look at the places I used to frequent, they pale in comparison. The service is extraordinarily attentive and kind hearted, it's evident that these are people who obviously take pride that they work for something they believe in, and it left me feeling lucky to have the option of a restaurant that I can fully believe in. Finally there is a place we locals can be proud of and give as an example of the fine eats available to out of towners who complain that we don't have any good Chinese resto's. I cannot wait to come back and try even more of the menu it's an adventure and a love affair that feels so good to embark on.

The Ice House is in all honesty and in all  pun-ery, the coolest venue CenPho has to offer. It is spacious, hollowed, and sacred. Reminiscent of warehouse raves I attended in my youth, the place brings back floods of sentimentality and nostalgia for shows long past. From it's humble origins in 1910 as an actual Icehouse, manufacturing 300lb ice blocks for Phoenix's food industry it now stands as a testament to our fair city's rapid urban sprawl. The days of ice manufacturing are, quite obviously long gone, but the eponymous title remains. Now it is host to the counterculture elite whose brotherly initiations into the Ice house festivities are served by a mere exchange of a few dollars and the ceremonial clasping of a wristband. My first visit here was a $10 experience that afforded me visual stimulation by means of a plethora of steam punk-esque art throughout the cavernous grounds, and audial pleasures via a rotation of house bands that included local favorites like Black Carl, Mergence, and What Laura Says, to name a few. Any visit to the IceHouse is a lesson in what enterprising Phoenicians can craft out of the abandoned and decrepit historic treasures scattered amongst the valley.

The gentrification of Phoenix has spread north unto Sunny Slope, akin to Sherman's march to the sea, the innumerable losses of life and conflagrations abound like the corpses strewn amongst the final scenes of 'Platoon". The great leviathan of progress and financial renovation knows no mercy and woe be to those who don't see the sign of the times a-changin' for their days are numbered. We can lament the yuppie businesses that are springing up in the area, making it safer for the starch collared subarbanites and their sticker family bedazzled suv's mobilizing panzer tank like amongst the parking lots and neighborhood streets that for so long were home to middle class families of largely salt of the earth ethnic backgrounds starkly contrasted to their invaders; or we can look to restaurants like Paquime and find a glimmer of hope.  Sleek, modern, unblemished and fastitiously tidy, Paquime has the feel of a scottsdale establishment, but the charm of a hole in the wall Slope mexi-street food joint. This is the first generation, slowly assimilating itself into a more milquetoast homogenized american cultura. That being said, this first generation still speaks spanish and remembers the ways of its parentage.  Paquime is muy autentica, and reminds me of family trips to puerto penasco, before cartel violence scared American families from returning. Street tacos and tortas, helados and paletas, home made aguas frescas, some varieties of pan dulce. The attention to detail and the love and care cooked into every morsel is abundantly clear. The staff all smiles and thoroughly amicable.   I took my mother here for mothers day last sunday and we gorged ourselves, well I gorged myself, she ate a portion of her flautas picking and pecking at them birdlike and insisted I finish the remainders. I ordered a torta milanesa, breaded beef avocado tomato and lettuce on a freshly baked bolillo roll. Supplementing that was an order of tacos de pescado, panko dusted fresh white cod,halibut,? not sure, but at any rate succulent and decilious. I devoured my meal rapaciously, not forgetting to note little acoutrements included with my order- a char grilled green onion and poblano chile with a tiny pickled jalapeno. Little things like these make my heart swell, I am a simple man.  Paquime is my new mistress after the death of my beloved Tacos Atoyac, and while I will remember Atoyac fondly I've moved on.

Palabra isn't just some salon, it's an ethos. This collective of artists exists to better their community through what they create. Whether it's sculpting the follicles that sprout outta your dome, housing local painter's creations, or hosting gallery events and photo shoots. There always seems to be something blossoming at Palabra that inspires. Each time I leave this place like a new man, as if I was baptised into some apostolic faith of creativity; getting a haircut is a ritual that shouldn't be entrusted to some amateur who's just punching a clock. The folks who make this place shine are skilled artisans in their trade, there is a seriousness and yet a playfulness at work here that I've come to find very comforting and trustworthy. I'd recommend Palabra to any and all, regardless of personal style or artistic creed, get your head checked and your look hooked up.
