The reviews I'm reading on the Rack Shack! don't do this place justice.  I'm sitting at home after a long night having some of the best potato salad and black eyed peas in the valley.. it's all about the sides people!!  The meats are good if you hit it early and they're GREAT if you hit it late.. as the night goes on, Rack Shack moves from 4 stars to 5 stars..  of course this is on the Late Night BBQ scale which is admittedly different than the Early Afternoon BBQ scale and the Mid-Day BBQ Scale.  Speaking of the Mid-Day BBQ Scale.. one of the worst places I've dined for BBQ lately is Dickey's BBQ.  what a joke that place is... Rack Shack has Dickey's Beat Hands Down.  Bonus! - I've prepared this rhyme to help you remember where they're located... Rack Shack Snack Attack.. get it rhyme, rhythm room? ... man... this review needs to end!

In the world of gas station foods, it is usually a sin to eat anything from "the kitchen", but Stayshons is THE exception! They make excellent Burritos in house!... The chorizo egg and cheese burritos are always fresh and tasty; never greasy or soggy. They also make red and green chile burritos whith some actual spice! For $4.50, it can't be beat!

Attention everyone considering Palatte for Brunch....  Don't listen to these haters.  Palatte has great food and excellent atmosphere.  It can be congested on weekends, but if you're prepared to take it easy, Palatte is a great option for brunch.  This being said, Here's the reason it's not a 5 in my book:  Pigeons (yes, pigeons.) Unfortunately the pigeons found palatte in a previous life when they were slow to bus tables and are as hooked on the deliciousness as we are.  Short of creating a new mascot (dead pigeon) and hanging it above the entry way, there really is no way to completely eradicate the pigeons, but they do a great job of pre-busing tables so there are far less pigeons than before.  I had the Bev and French Toast this morning and only saw 2 pigeons.. Way to Go Palatte!

i just returned from Over Easy and I'm a fan.  The man (referred to by other reviewers) who runs the place was very courteous and not only did he help us get seated, he also checked on us during our meal and made a point to say goodbye when we left.  (and it's Sunday Morning)  Food I had their mushroom,cheddar, and scallions Omlette and it was delicious!  They use the 'standard' mushroom and 2 other varieties I couldn't identify *the identification issue is on my part, not theirs :)  The omlette was cooked perfectly and was big enough for 2 people to split.  The Coffee was good for breakfast shop coffee.  Not burned or weak.. I even got a cup to go.  So, to the 2 start haters out there I say: "Lighten up, and enjoy life Over Easy".

My friend Jon and I stopped for gas at the Cheveron near the outlet malls on I-17.  We spotted Cafe Afify due south across the street..  When we walked in at 5pm the restaurant was empty and quiet but the owner had a smile on his face and welcomed us in.  We sat down and ordered... I had the Lamb Roll up *which was excellent.  Jon is one of those "give it to me plain or give me death" kind of eaters so he ordered the Chicken Kabob dinner "extra plain".  When it arrived it was piping hot and DELICIOUS.  I don't think I've ever tasted better grilled chicken.  If you're ever in the area, Cafe Afify is the place to be.

Again, the haters grumble about trivial issues...  I walked to Luci's from my house and was parched when I arrived.  I grabbed a large cup of the BEST TEA OF MY LIFE.  It's a pomegranate citrus green tea and they sell it for 5.99 in the tea area.. Usually green teas are bitter or have a bitter bite, but this tea was excellent. I had 3 huge glasses.. By the time I got home I had to pee in the worst way.. hah!  OK, second thing. Ken the owner  was walking around talking to everyone and told us about the work they did to install new trusses in the building .. way cool.  As you walk in (facing the coffee station), check out the food in the fridge.. it's prepared fresh every morning and the intent is for people to grab on the way to work.. fresh home made food.. awesome..   We also met Ebenezer Williams, the chef responsible for the hominy and beet chicken salad we had.. man was that good.  We talked to Ebenezer for a while about his cooking and he said the reason he cooks is to see that look in peoples eyes when they taste something really great that they didn't expect.. well Ebenezer, zing; Hominy and Beets it is!  REALLY Cool Fact: they have a demo kitchen where they'll be doing cooking classes and other food related stuff.. right on!   The only thing I'd like to see in addition to the cool stuff they're already doing is a weekend special like Omelet  Sundays or pancake Saturdays.. that would rock!
