This place used to be good and I was disappointed the last time I went. Soggy fried rice, the waitress didn't ask us how the food is, I hope they shape up.

Overpriced food for small portions. The good is ok not worth the money. The ham and cheese is good. After we left we were hungry that we went to Carl's junior. Terrible never again.

Luis is an honest hard working and reliable man. He is a professional and treat you with respect. Best of all he is an expert not just in transmissions but overall mechanical work in any car. I was a wholesale car dealer and have hundreds of cars repaired at his shop. HONESTY is the most important for me.   I just dropped a car where it wasn't starting this morning. I believed it was the starter. He checked it for 45min then he told me there is nothing wrong with the starter. It is the key that is not programmed for the car. He could have easily changed the starter and charged but he didn't. He charged me nothing. It is very rare to find a quality of technicians nowadays.  Bring your car to 2b Transmission. Honesty, integrity, professionalism, and peace of mind all of that with very reasonable charge. Can't ask for more and I've worked with many shops in the past until I found Louis. You'll be glad you did too.

Incredible Thai food. Nice people. They offered my wife and I a free bowl of coconut soup as we were debating on tum yum kong. So we ended having both Along with the drunken noodles. Then they served us complimentary green tea ice cream!
