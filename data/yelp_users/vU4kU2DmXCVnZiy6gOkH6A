Not the highest quality selection for a second hand shop. There was an enormous selection of furniture. Most of it was quite overpriced, probably waiting for half off day. Probably will not visit again unless looking for furniture and only on half price day.

Meaty. Markety. Should be ladies night everynight--there were some incredibly tireless, strong and fun women who seemed to love their music--knew all the lyrics. They made  my night! Save the adorable security staff, men didn't really dance, except for a few who didn't know how to put down their drink--it's a DANCE CLUB. Are those boys there for themselves? Priority for me: first is the dance. Enjoying atmosphere/scenery is second--and scouting is a far third. Go to Axis Radius to be, have and behold some grope and ogle. Reminds me of Borderline, in Chicago--closed now, i think. They serve as the after bar party--but that means to me, they should be open til 4am--if it were not for Scottsdale law, eh?

Dr. Mary Ann has a calming effect on my dental-anxieties. And Dr. Terry keeps me laughing! There is no other place in the Valley who can provide yearly exams/cleanings as well as dental implants right in the same office--implants done the same day means in and out in an hour! The customer service level of the whole staff shows how much they care about patients--you are not just treated like the next in line.

There is never much at this store but sometimes the clothing can dole out a few good items. The house where items aren't too bad. And sometimes there is some furniture. Super hit or miss. Will stop back in periodically.

You don't know until you try Teharu, the wonders of sushi plates stacked to the ceiling without breaking your wallet! I highly  recommend this spot. I loved the wait staff and sushi chefs -- excellent customer service and smiles all around the room. You can tell everyone was happy!

Molcajete Barba Roja. Means carnivore's delight in gringo. Serves two. In abundance. So impressed, no kiddin'. The octopus was grilled and perfectly not too chewy. Grilled, HAM wrapped shrimp. What the ef. Why I not think a that? Chicken, steak, rellenos, sweet scallion. Heaven? Yes.

Swiss Water Process Decaffinated Espresso. 99.9% caffeine free, but all the polyphenols and all the other benefits. The ONLY decaffinated coffee, said the owner. ONLY proprietor in the greater valley to have it, and it's green coffee beans. Can you feel the enthusiasm?

Yum-ola. Friendly bartender. Bunches of tvs, free WiFi, great food, and affordable. Enlightened spinach salad, chicken hoagie, meatball Sammie are all fabulouso. I eat tons of food. They serve large portions and fresh food, lots of veggies. I am a happy lean clean-eatin mean lady.

So thankful to find smashing shawarma and a tidy unique beer selection next to my massage studio at Salon Studios. I lived in Chicago and have tried many many terrific pita sammies. This ranks up there with all the great ones. Service was super friendly. Stop by the specialty store for kosher-food selections and merchandise.

Far and away, my place to eat away from home, my favorite in all the U. S.  May the people and establishment remain forever. So thankful for the humans that keep it running. I love every part of the whole that is Bragg's. Devastating dishes celebrate raw material; simplicity bewitched by culinary complexity, extravagance and love. Thank you for sharing. Thanks to the universe you are in my town of residence. I come back to parade you to the unenlightened. When in surgery, you will be my final and first meal when I awake. No shit.

Bonnie Moehle is my Personal Life Coach.  I have experienced PTSD and generalized anxiety for decades.  With Bonnie's guidance, I can say, "I am a happy individual. It comes from within and has nothing to do with external sources." These are my words and you can quote them. And I want you to trust me, it means more to me, in my business, in my family, to regain the feeling of confidence, self-reliance, and true inner-calm. I might never have achieved without Bonnie's Personal Life Coaching. Surly, it would have taken decades more, relying on psychotherapists. Which is essentially relying on myself. Nobody but BONNIE taught me the TOOLS.  The secret is this:  I always possessed the happiness and the calm. I forgot how to access it! That is, until Bonnie Moehle became part of my life. It is a scary place to fake happiness in this world. I work too hard all day long, to feel alone and sad. Bonnie is my saving Grace. She is the channel I tune into when I feel like I'm falling away from the happiness in my heart and mind, when i start to loose the calm and start snappin' at friends & co-workers.   Contact her this moment and ask, "I want happiness, can you help?"  Keep Bonnie in your car at all times with the self-narrated Audio Book, "What Is Happiness & Where Can I Get Some?"  It ain't easy being human. But, if you are lucky enough to have the insight to know you need help, Bonnie Moehle is the person to call.

Not much there. Cleaned out. Not the highest quality second hand items. Do not think I will return for a while, if at all. May come back and look harder at the clothing selection.

Kristin's hands are truly magic -- Many have fallen under her "spell" of serenity within the expertise and trust in her sessions and I am thankful to be one of them!   Kristin Hudgins is not your average Massage Therapist. Not only does she put me in a state of zen, her location has a beautiful location. She's just south of Scottsdale and Shea. I can get my hair done on one corner, see her for massage and have lunch with my friends at any number of restaurants --they're all less than minute's walk from this thriving spot.   Plus, if I feel like staying home or having a Girls Night IN -- she also offers Mobile Massage!  --Ani Whalen, LMT & One Body Fan Club
