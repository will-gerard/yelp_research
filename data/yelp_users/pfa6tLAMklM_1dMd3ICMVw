This restaurant has excellent food and the staff are kind and welcoming. They don't have many gluten-free options (tamari) but the overall experience was very enjoyable!

I first tried Aioli Burger at First Friday last month. The line felt like it took forever, probably only 10 minutes, but that tells me something, that the food must be worth it. I got the White Truffle Burger, HOLY MOLY IT WAS AMAZING!!! I am obsessed with Truffles and I love mushrooms and swiss, so this burger was perfect for me. I highly recommend it! I will be returning to Aioli Burger this month for first Friday again! I also hope to check out the pop up restaurant on Mill Ave! Thanks for making such amazing burgers guys!

yelp removed my previous review saying that they thought I'd left it on the wrong businesses page, but no, this review is meant for Tapacubo, not some other business. So here it is again.  I came to this bar for the two dollar beers and I saw a beer on tap that I had never tried before. I asked to have a taste of a beer I had never tried before and the bartender was extremely rude. He asked me if I was kidding for asking for a taste because the beers were only two dollars. Regardless of the price of the beer, I wanted to know whether I enjoyed it, which isn't too much to ask for. The bartender chose not to serve me after I asked for a taste and this kind of service deserves a poor review.

Great salad! I seriously cannot recommend the salad more. And the pita was great too. But damn. Their salads are great
