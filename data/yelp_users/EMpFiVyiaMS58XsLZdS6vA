As  a steak house reviewer most the time, I like it.  The Sausage with the cranberry chuteny sauce appitizer was great, their bread and soups were top notch.  The steak was made good by their sauces.  Their wine selection was good and the waiter new a lot.  the abmiance is your typical Durants, Don and Charlies, Donovans old school vibe. Service great, btu it was a late lunch too.

It's okay.  I remember a time where top of the rocks menu and restaurant in general could compete with others such as Durrant's or capital Grille or the compass room... Not anymore.  23$-45$ main course of steak and fish, very reasonable but nothing fantastic anymore..  They just change their menu this past Wednesday and I have to say that I'm not impressed. I frequent this place a lot with my bosses and fellow employees. They have a nice upscale setting but allow for the casual dress. The cocktails I have to say are really good but with the new menu has not been that great.my boyfriend had the 16 ounce ribeye last night and that was completely worth it the way that it was crispy on the outside and the perfect rare pink on the inside was great and the seasoning was great but the side dishes are something less than to be desired. Almost raw green beans, three very little new potatoes, one small round russet potato is your "scalloped potatoes", crunchy the polentas or Kinwall, and the only thing that comes with fries is the burger.  The way that they've paired up their sides in their main courses makes you want to order the main course but then ask for a completely different side dishes that are meant to be with other main courses.  by far though the only side dish that we enjoyed was the housemaid fries with a side of the jalapeno aoli sauce.mind you the sauce is with a different dish and the fries are with the different dish. I suggest looking at the whole menu and then asking them to substitute sides. I'm not quite sure what they were thinking when they paired up these sides. The main dishes of either chicken fish or steak are really good but as I said the side dishes really aren't that great. The way they serve their bread now as well with one small piece of cornbread and two little slices of French bread is a little ridiculous to. The portions are a lot smaller. But there are a agave honey butter that comes with the bread is very good. Also the fact that they only offer a split pea soup that isn't even that great but only if you get the three-course meal is elect out as well. I just have to say I don't like this new menu and it needs some more tweaking.  Also. The way that they serve there pork belly are too large squares with a little bit of sauce seared on the outside. One of my favorite things to order everywhere is pork belly. My two favorite places that have it right now our grass roots kitchen tap andHouse of tricks. It's also very hard to screw it up. But last night they manage to have my pork belly come out ice cold in the middle.when I sent it back and they made me a new one this time it came sliced in the slivers with the crispy outside layer and the raw pork belly on the inside slightly warm. It was much better but it just wasn't a really good cut of pork belly. It also ruined my appetite a little bit after biting into a big chunk of pork belly that was ice cold in the middle. But my boyfriend steak was really amazing.   With the weather being the way it is definitely asked to sit outside it has a great view if they would cut back the sum of the shrubbery just about every table would have a great view but unfortunately they have trees covering a lot of the view of the city you could have sitting outside. I grew up in Tempe so I am very familiar with this restaurants and have worked next to it for a long time. I just remember it used to be more upscale and through the years it's become more mediocre. More like just another restaurant attached to a hotel. They really need to bring back some of the good more hearty filling side dishes.   The service was good but you do get a lot better service being inside then you do outside. For example after I was given my pork belly and I bit into it and it was ice cold I needed to grab a waiter that was coming out bringing a check for another table to have them take it back because I hadn't seen my waitress. She was very nice and very knowledgeable about the new menu but I noticed that all the servers for the outside which there were three different servers for 8 tables outside, was slow.  If you don't like something and you're sitting outside I would highly suggest trying to taste it before your waiter waitress disappears.

I don't know why I ever call in orders for this place. Every time I call in my order they always get it wrong. This is the third time in a row that I have called in my order, they tell me "it's going to be 10 or 15 minutes, " I actually give them  fifteen minutes extra (showing up 30 minutes after I order) and I they  my order wrong. Somebody either forgets to put something in, automatically assumes everything has pepperoni on it, or they give away my cheese bread before I get here. I'm actually here right now after I ordered 40 minutes ago to find out The cooks made two pepperoni pizzas without looking at the actual order that said two cheese pizzas, it's written right on my receipts that there are two cheese pizzas and two cheese breads.  My actual order is correct on the receipt but some people are into much of a hurry to actually read what was ordered .   On top of that, they completely forgot to make my cheese bread. So now I'm having to wait 10 extra minutes. You would also think they would have more people working during the rush-hour time. The line is out the door and it's 110Â°. The kids working here have no idea what they're doing. I would like to amend my review and say that one of the kids behind the counter saw me sitting in my car with all of my kids waiting for the pizza. I was actually typing this review. He came out into the parking lot looking for me I brought my pizza to the car. He gave me a few extra sauces too. He just wanted to make right what the girl on the phone had gotten wrong and the cooks in the back. At least one of them was trying to help a customer. I do appreciate that.

Service is great, especially Jerry, she is fantastic and we have ended up with her each time. This place is great, you just pay more for the view, then you do the food.  I have never seen the place super busy, except for holidays like the 4th or valentines.  The food is good, but a bit overpriced for the quality.  The filet mignon is good, but not fantastic.  It is tender though. Like I said, you pay more for the view.  The Pork Tenderloin was amazing last night, the sauce and everything was super good, but the apple cabbage salad was awful.  Substitute it.  It is so peppered and there is hardly any apple.  I expected Sweet and started coughing and needed water.  I scrapped it off and just enjoyed the Brie Polenta and Meat.  We also got the truffle Mac n Cheese and that was fabulous too. Small fancy portions, good presentation.  Its just your typical fancy food, meat and potatoes place with a great view.  It can get a little warm with the glass and the sun hitting you just right.  It takes a full 45 minutes to go all the way around.   The service was great, the food was good, the wait for the food was a bit too long.  I think they assume from the view that you don't mind.  But it did take way too long for 3 medium rare meats. The lobster chowder is fantastic.

If your dog needs space and you like to walk or do laps with your fuzzy buddy, THIS IS THE PLACE.  It's a nice large basin with trees, lighting and a timid dog area.  You can find pretty much the same group of people every evening or morning.  Friendly too. The only bad part is the only water is located by the door, so if your walking on the other side of the park, you should bring a cooler. This park is great for runners and dogs that love to play fetch. It's closed every thursday.

#1?!  Really?  Have you been there?  First off there is not enough parking, the sidewalk to enter the park takes you on a hefty hike AROUND the rolling hills, so if you have a dog that is in a hurry to get to his favorite place be ready for a long walk.  Next,  lets look at the "wonderful" lake with poor circulation and filtering that is always filthy and covered in film. Ther is NEVER any tennis balls or toys left there either.  I have left some several times but they are never there after cleaning.  Next, the grass...or the LACK THERE OF!  The place is COVERED in mud and has NO TREES!  This picture you provide shows the area around the dog park and is about a year old if not more.  In AZ can you imagine no shade anywhere.  Besides the few benches away from the main play area with one cover, there is no shade anywhere or coming soon due to the trees all dying off. The biggest complaint still has to be the mud and lack of shade.  They close this park every August to "improve it" and all everyone wanted was shade and GRASS, so the park stayed closed all August for us to return just this morning to...MUD and NO SHADE.  You can't even tell what they did if anything besides take out the dead trees (still leaving two) and watering the mud.  This is NOT the best dog park by any means.  The rolling hills makes your walks rather tiring, the sidewalks dont even go in the more fun areas, there are ants all over the tables and benches as well as spiderwebs from there lack of use, and there is no grass except in places where you are not supposed to walk your dogs.  Someone that actually visits this park should try visiting it more often, or looking at the other parks in the area like Virgina and Greenfield or the Scottsdale Park.

I'm sure they are great but the DONT take appointments, u CANNOT call ahead, And they ALWAYS say "it's about a twenty minute wait".  ITS NOT.  This place is always busy and it always has a line. yes they have lots of barbers, and yes they do a great job from what I can see from the people walking out but you really need to plan to spend the two to three hours waiting there if you show up on a weekend or right after work around five.  you go in and you take a number and wait.you'll notice that there are certain people that go there frequently enough that don't take numbers. These are people that know the barbers and don't have to take a number and wait like everyone else. They will do their friends and their regulars and let them cut in line in front of you.we called ahead of time and asked what the wait was like and of course we heard "20 minutes" ...an hour and a half later and still six people in front of my boyfriend we left. i'm sure if you have the time to wait or want to go with your family and let the wife go and do her shopping while you wait 1 to 2 hours at the barbershop that would be an ideal situation.

I honestly love this place.  Their Crab Bisque and Muddled Berry Martinis are the best.  I go just for this when I want to be cheap.  The filit and Cowboy steak are great.  The Augratin was bad the last tiem we went.  The cowboy steak is great and so are their peppered gravy.

I'm used to every chick Fila I go to gladly giving law enforcement, military police, and corrections officers 30-50% discounts. I visit the ones at stapley, university, and ray road weekly due to this, with much appreciation to chick Fila for their support and understanding for those working in this industry. I was shocked to find out that this independently own and operated chick Fila not only refuses to offer this discount but also waters down their beverages more, decreases their weight/portions more and Frys thier chicken more deeply.  I will not be revisiting this chickfila and will gladly share with other law enforcement that unlike other supportive chick Filas through out az, this one stands out in a negative way and does not do justice to other restaurants baring its name.

An update...Still went to this Store last weekend and the food portions on the strips and nuggets were smaller than usual, and the servers still just "there" in a sense.  The other chick filas seem to have happier and just nicer employees.  They weren't mean abut they were typical. But we asked about the military discount or law enforcement discount again and the manager replied that unfortunately we do not do this.  When I asked about how they are the only Chick Fila that doesn't, his reply was "unfortunately, the owner just doesn't want to consider it.  We know that others have talked about it and mentioned it, but its up to him and he just doesn't want to offer it."

Made an apt and showed up and the man was short with me and said it didn't matter and I had a 20-30 min wait.  There was only 4 people working and they had all started a service.  So I went down the street to nice nails and they took me and did a great job

I had a Brazilian wax with Aubrey. Very quick and easy, in and out. If your waxers really know what they're doing they're not supposed to take their time and that's exactly what she did. I've been getting waxed for quite some time now and I'm used to the fast pace and the sensitivity of the matter. She even tweezed a few extra hairs afterward. If you're going in for a Brazilian wax you can't be a shy type. If you're shy and uncertain about this- it's not for you. These girls see everything and the more access you can give them, the better your wax will turn out. Aubrey did a really great job and was quick and professional. The place was clean and elegant.

This place is a nice atmosphere but I was really disappointed when evening. There's about 8 o'clock at night and the weather was beautiful. The back patio an open bar area is a really great place. Unfortunately the food was not. The food was very plain and you could definitely tell that the homemade chips had way too much salt on them to cover up that they had been sitting out for too long or the oil had not been changed. The same for the fish and chips. You can definitely tell that the oil had not been changed sitting out for too long or the oil had not been changed. The same for the fish and chips. You can definitely tell that the oil had not been changed. The drinks were OK, the martinis well flavored. I was just really looking forward to the homemade chips and dip. You could tell that the dip was really good probably at the beginning of the day and that the chips when they are fresh, are probably amazing. But this was a Friday night at 8 o'clock and everything tasted like it had been fried in the same oil and oversalted. We gone there for drinks in the atmosphere but not the food lately.

Live thus place. It's just a shame when you stay at the hotel that this is their only pool and even as a guest that's paying to stay there you don't get dibs over seats in the sun. The only benefit you get is being able to charge your drinks to your room other than that it's just like a separate bar and separate location from the hotel Also if you're staying at the hotel, you don't get to use the pool longer hours. It's like a club that closes. If there's nobody at the pool around nine or 10 o'clock, or anyone at the bar area around the pool, it closes. Also if you have a room that's close to the pool and there happens to be a pool party or dance party that night don't expect to get any sleep. The drinks are expensive and it's definitely a Scottsdale type scene being a pool that's on the third floor of the hotel. Good place to be seen, swim and drink. The food isn't that bad either.  The mitary rate for the Paloma's is great too
