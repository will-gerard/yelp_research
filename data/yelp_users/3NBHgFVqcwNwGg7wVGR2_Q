If you need a new mattress, I highly recommend Sack Time in Scottsdale. We couldn't have asked for a better experience than the one we had. Nicolas, (the store owner) made our experience pleasant and he never pressured us to purchase. He listened to our needs and led us to a bed that we are very pleased with and it's organic. I'm so glad we found that store because I hate shopping for mattresses.

We sat outside and the area was absolutely filthy. They obviously don't clean the patio regularly, there is no way. We started with soup and it was super thick and flavorless. Fortunately, the rest of our meal was ok. We will not return to this PF Changs

I have eaten at your establishment several times and have always been seated upon my arrival, except for today I was told that they NEVER seat you until your whole party has arrived. That's not true, so your front desk person just called me a liar and was rude to me while doing it. She could have easily offered me a cup of coffee while I waited or made any attempt to be pleasant with me. It was a huge fail in customer service.  Our server was sweet and she was tipped well for a great job. The food was ok, nothing special.

We have been there 3 times hoping they would work out the kinks. The service has been poor each visit and the food has been poor to average.
