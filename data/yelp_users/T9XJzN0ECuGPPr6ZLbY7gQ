Roast beef and Gorgonzola sandwich was okay... Hard to mess up. The soup I had and the soup my friend had were both cold and gross.

Can I choose zero stars?  I'm sitting waiting for my food and all I hear is cussing and employees talking bad about customers.   Good thing for dominos they don't rely on customer service and feedback because they are a crappy Walmart style pizza dump.   If only I had something cheap like dominos closer.

Went in for drinks and dinner. The drinks were amazing!  I told Spotty I wanted something with whiskey and let him take over. Each drink was delicious.   Drinks= amazing Crispy pig ears= amazing Any of the raw items= amazing Dumpling with pork= so delicious I want to just keep it in my mouth and not swallow it. It was heaven in my mouth.   I will be back soon. Found my new favorite spot.

Cold food and a cold shoulder. Customer service is better at McDonald's.   I brought my food to the bartender because it was cold. No "sorry about that", nothing from my waitress, nothing from a manager, nothing from the guy that works here that was at the bar that let the bartender know I was there.    Get your shit together.
