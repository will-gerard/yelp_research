I came to Snapdragon for a color correction.  Snapdragon not only fixed my hair from the last place but made it look natural and amazing!!! The whole Snapdragon team was nice, educated, professional and helpful. My correction was not easy. I came in with bright yellow and orange hair, with a bunch of gross toner and who knows what else from the previous place. Kandy  (my hair colorist) was a hair genius and confident! She did a great job. I can't thank her enough!!!  I was desperate and got 1000x what I expected. The bonus was that I expected to pay a lot more than I did for that level of expert. I'm never going anywhere else...ever.  I recommend this place to anyone. PS they are busy and can book out quite a bit in advance. Make sure to make an appointment. Thank you Snapdragon team!!!!!

They messes up my to go order then refused to fix it. The kid at the counter was rude. I asked if i could speak with a manager she said he was to busy. Done with place.
