Great place for simple sandwiches and salads.  If you're looking for variety this is not the place for you.

Real, legit, Shaanxi food.    I am convinced the lackluster reviews are from people expecting American-Chinese.  I've been to Xi-an, and House of Egg Roll is pretty spot on.  Rivals Xi'an Famous Foods.  After my first visit, I went back a week later.

Cowboy Ciao will serve you a nice plate of food but will fail to excite.  I could serve these plates out of my own kitchen.   For example, braised short rib, red quinoa, steamed bok choy and a side of dipping sauce.  Pictures all these components separated on the plate as opposed to being plated on top of each other in any way.  Take your money elsewhere.

Good, quick and fairly priced.  Persian Room is definitely not an occasion restaurant but I'd be happy going back any week night.  The highlight was the minced lamb kebab.

Pizzeria Bianco is good but fails to live up to the hype of being one of the best pies in the country.  Places like this are scattered throughout first rate cities like New York.  I was lucky that there was no wait because I would have been very disappointed if I had to wait for just a good pie as opposed to one that was exceptional.

Durant's is full of nostalgia.  There was even a diner at the bar wearing a cowboy hat, which, makes senses given a guidebook wrote that Durant's is the place where business deals are done by old school business men wearing boots and cowboy hats. And entering through the kitchen made me feel like I was in Goodfellas.     Ambiance gets  five for the novelty factor where the food gets a three.  What really makes Durant's worthwhile is that the price of a steak includes a salad or soup and a side and are what you'd pay at a comparable a la carte steakhouse.  In its category Durant's is worthwhile going back to.

The best coffee cafe I've ever been to, ever.  I love this place.  The decor and ambiance is top notch.  The food is good and breakfast comes out quickly.  All the different areas are unique and one has a projection screen.  Fresh squeezed juice is a nice touch.  Serves alcohol.  I could go on and on and on but I'd give Lux six stars if I could; and this is saying a lot considering that I have an east coast bias.  Lux would kick the ass of any of the hipster coffee shops in Manhattan or Williamsburg any day.

I was here this past April. Daniel Boulud Brasserie definitely deserves its Michelin star.   Flat bread was great. Salad was great. Chicken, mussels, chickpea fries, all three of the deserts that were ordered, cheese and everything was excellent. The chicken in particular was extremely moist.   Coming here has made me want to try Chef Daniel's restaurants in New York.

Chelsea's Kitchen serves really nice food in a casual environment.  Its the type of environment where expectations are flat and your meal exceeds what you'd expect.  Kale slaw is unique and the short rib tacos were tasty.  Velvet cake was pretty solid.  I'd go back.

Keeping in mind that Sauce is a chain, the pizza is pretty good.  In my opinion a thinner crust is the only way to serve pizza.

Don't be afraid when you walk into the dimly lit space that mimics the feel of being in a coal mine.  Cornish Pasty Co offers up a wide variety of pasties that are very good.  I think this my new spot for lunch on my way to the airport.    Good beer too.

Best tacos I have ever had.  Corn, flour, beef cheek, beef tongue, carne asada, pork, everything.  Don't be afraid to step into this hole in the wall.  I'd drive from Tucson just for these tacos.

I seriously think the Kobe beef patty in the 777 burger was not freshly prepared.  It was too round and flat to be molded in a chef's hand.

When I initially finished my meal, more like a feast, at Roka Akor I thought the establishment was worthy of three stars.  But with each passing day I realized how good my meal was.  To start the space is wide open and offers three, four if you I think the lounge is separate from the bar, dining spaces.  The menu is extensive, although, I did not appreciate the server trying to show off her menu knowledge.  Tons of food and tons of booze from the East.  The deluxe sashimi platter was over the top and included crab legs with a truffle emulsion on top that was melted by a torch.  They were so good I ordered more on top of he platter.  The yakatori was good but I wish the menu offered items such as livers and chicken skins.  The lamb cutlets (really a chop) with Korean spices were cooked to perfect.  All the vegetable sides were excellent.    If you have deep pockets Roka Akor  is a great location to impress a date because not only if the food excellent, but, also because its a fun dining experience.  Only downside is that you pay for the experience as much as you do the food.

I'm not impressed with the concept or the food. I was here for lunch and the dining room was darker than most other restaurants are for dinner.

L'Express, for me, is just another restaurant in Montreal that let me down. I'm seriously beginning to question the dining scene up there. L'Express is a proper bistro complete with bare essential service. We also waited 40 minutes beyond our reservation time. Trust me the free beer was not worth waiting 40 minutes.   The food was only worthy of two stars. Salad was just a salad. Terrine of foie gras was nice but not worth 30 CAD. (Why on every menu in Canada is foie gras so expensive? I find it much for expensive than anywhere I've been the USA.). Veal cheek casserole was nice but nothing special. The risotto could have used more protein in it. Lamb was OK. Just nothing popped out as being above average. However, the bread was awesome.   No need for me to come back here.

I usually don't comment on anything outside of a restaurant experience. I only branch out on special occasions. I LOVE how Stereo has rebuilt itself since it burnt down. This is my favourite club in North America and probably top 10, maybe top 5, if you include Europe also. Stereo keeps bringing in great DJs. Awesome minimal night this past weekend. Why go to Circus?

THE place for a pre or post game meal when you see the Habs.  The ribs used to be better and I do not like the switch to the express game day menu.  On a recent visit the ribs were dry.  That being said the next time I am in Montreal for a hockey game I'll still go back because its just what you do before a Habs game.

This slightly over priced deli serves enormous platters and sandwiches of smoked meats in classic Montreal fashion.  Desserts are huge.  Avoid around Habs games if you want to eat in a prompt fashion.

Joe Beef provided me with the best meal I have ever had in Montreal.  The establishment is dark and intimate.  The service was very friendly and knew the menu well.  Rumor has it that this is where David Chang likes to go when in town.  (This probably is most likely the case since he wrote the introduction for the Joe Beef cookbook)  The dishes have some Momofuku-like attributes but its unfair to compare Joe Beef to Chang's restaurant group.  They are similar in the way foods are paired or as I like to say mashed up; like the musical genre  When I think back to the food Joe Beef served us it make me imagine this is the type of food a cook would serve to guest in his home.  We started with fresh oysters that spoke for themselves.  My large group doubled down on the double down foie gras;  we ordered two of the entrees that sandwiched bacon and cheese between to pieces of lightly battered and fried foie.  This was pretty ridiculous and good.  I thought the foie was a bit over done.  The eel nuggets were nice but failed to excite.  The best starter for me was the clams, riz and squid.  The squid stuffed with rice reminded me of being in Spain.  Tentacles gently placed inside the opened clams completed the great presentation.  The Cote du Boeuf for two was a bone in rib eye steak served Peter Luger style cut and served with spoons to serve each person.  Bone marrow and a potato, sort of au gratin, accompanied the dish.  The grass fed beef spoke for itself but came out closer to the medium side.  We didn't specify temperature.  Maybe it was my fault for assuming unless otherwise specified beef comes out medium rare.  Lobster and spaghetti featured perfectly cooked lobster mixed in with a bit of pasta in a very light cream sauce.  Although I appreciate the bite of al dente pasta I thought Joe Beef's could have been cooked more.  The star of the meal for me was the crab stuffed whole artic char.  This was one of the best things I have eaten this year and the reason why I will try to make it back to Joe Beef the next time I am in Montreal.  We tried each of the deserts.  A take on a backed potato that consisted of two meringues was forgettable.  The carrot cake was very good.  The sorbet was maybe the best sorbet I have ever tasted.  The worst part about the experience was the terrible, terrible espresso.  It was like if someone brewed the most bitter coffee they could find then squeezed a lemon in it.  It was so bad that the fellas and me ended up going somewhere near by for a digestive.  The meal had some ups and downs but all together it was a stellar meal.   This was a great place and meal for a group of six guys celebrating a birthday.  There was a group of older gentlemen behind us doing the same.  The only other thing I can advise is that Joe Beef only has to seatings; one at 7p and another at 9:30p.

Closed. Next nearest location is at the Best Western on Rue Drummond. I feel they lost something during the move. I don't enjoy the food as much in their new location.

So Resto L'appartement sucks.  While the establishment tries to be uber trendy it turns off customers who are actually more interested in the food than the fake vibe.

I've been here a few times and its never been anything special, sometimes even not good.  Dollar tacos and dollar beers night is good though.  I wouldn't get anything else but the tacos here.  I'd only come back here for the dollar special.

In its category the food at PDC is not worthy of a higher rating than one star.   I almost did not get in this past weekend since my reservation was somehow lost despite a voicemail confirming it. Service did their best but was slow. PDC was out of two wines that were on the menu. I don't know if I just had bad luck with the two I wanted, but, I can only guess they were out of other bottles as well. They were also out of the foie gras dish I asked for.   At the recommendation of the server I ordered the Plogue à Champlain. This dish has a lot of potential but was not executed correctly. The dish was seared foie gras on top of English style bacon, potatoes and a crepe with the entier dish soaked in maple syrup. One of the components was cold and the foie gras was charred on the outside and close to rare on the inside.   The only good dish of the night was the Tomato Tartlet that had a very good pastry crust.   The proteins in the PDC's Melting Pot were not seasoned at all. The mash was good and I had to use it to get any flavor on the proteins.   The special rib eye steak, recommend by the server over Shepherd's Pie was decent but nothing I could not prepare at home with a quality product.   The worst dish of the night was the special desert. The summer pudding consisted of a 'cooked' shortbread with 'fresh' summer beers. The shortbread was under temperature and the berries had to have come packaged in syrup.   A side of fries that was ordered with everything else never came.   The one star is on the food alone. Based on all the hype and reviews here I don't know what to make of my one experience here. Was it an off night? In any event my meal was simply not good.

Wow, Kitchin blew me away. The dining room was elegant but still bright. Service was very friendly except for the French staff who were sterile and highly efficient yet still professional as can only expected from a French server. The most refreshing part of Kitchin was actually seeing Tom Kitchin in the kitchen with his hands in the food; there is a small window that allows you to see into the kitchen from the dining room. It is becoming increasingly rare to see a chef in the restaurant that his name on it.   Veg crisp were giving as snack. A great selection of bread was also served. The amuse bouche of pumpkin soup with crunch pumpkin seed in it was very wintery and was more than just one small bite.  I was a bit weary of the Pig's Head and Langoustine because I was not sure how the Langoustine could add to this dish. Trust me something would be missing it wasn't on the plate. The pig's head was boned and rolled and had a great earthy spice to it.   My main of venison was cooked perfectly and had seven components on the dish. Any time I see many components on the dish I get nervous. But Kitchin surprised me again. This was a pretty hardy winter dish for a restaurant in this category. (I left really full)   My desert was simply titled Chocolate and features mall souflee, ice cream and blood orange marmalade the made everything else taste so much better.   When I told the staff I was from Boston I was invited into the Kitchen to meet Chef Kitchin and he also signed a copy of his cookbook for me. This guy seems really down to earth. My 5/5 review is based off the food I ate and not that I met the chef.

This place is getting a star only because I have to give it one.  I think the only selling point is girls in short skirts and low tops.  This didn't work out for me because I came here to eat.

Let me start with the food.  The meal started off fine with a salad of beets, greens and goats cheese.  The deviled eggs from a variety of fowl was more like hard boiled eggs then deviled eggs.  Lamb chops had a nice flavor but came out before they had the chance to settle.  Fish over couscous was a disaster.  Conceptually the dish was suppose to be freshly cooked hot fish over cold couscous - this was verified by the server.  I don't see how this is a good idea because when you combine a hot element with a cold element you just get lukewarm, especially when one is piled on top of the other.  The fish was actually lukewarm because of a mistake in the kitchen.    Despite having a reservation the flustered server at the door asked us to check out the restaurant's attached shop.  It was quite a while before the server greeted our table.  Everything was fine until we waited over 35 minutes between the starters and entrees.  It is painfully obvious that the fish dish was cooked before the kitchen realized they forgot to fire the lamb chops.  Instead of re-cooking the fish the kitchen decided to send it out cold along with the sizzling chops.    Upon sending the dish back the server asked if we'd like anything else.  After explaining to her that I did not wish to prolong an unsatisfactory experience she sent over what appeared to be another server.  The gentlemen asked if there was anything else we would like and I just asked for the bill.  He barked at me 'there is no bill tonight' and quickly walked away without saying anything else or allowing me the opportunity to say anything else.  An awkward night ended with a quick good bye and lots of laughs in the car.

Wow.  This is a great spot.  After driving by two times, I finally parked near the party supply company and walked into La Santisima to find a small dining room full of satisfied customers...and a huge salsa bar!  Highlights include the Santisima taco with Oaxaca cheese, and the baja shrimp.

Passage to India is just another curry house serving up dishes with muddled flavors that won't excite you.  Paratha was a bit dense and came to the table when I was half way through my curry.

I was not a big fan of Renegade Canteen.  Bacon wrap shrimp stuffed with cheese and jalapenos over grits was good but that is where the good flavors ended.  The risotto in the short rib over 'creamy' risotto was more like short rib over wet soupy undercooked rice.  The sauce on the flank stake hit only one note and the steak was a bit tough, even for the cut.  Pork osso bucco was very bland.  I grinded some salt from the grinder on the table into the dish and it elevated the dish about 2 starts.  Simple things like seasoning could have gone a long way.  I passed on dessert.

JoBot is in a very cool, laid back area of Phoenix.  Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  Cartel coffee is what brings this spot to four stars for me. I'd defintly go back.

Citizen Public House truly epitomizes modernist cuisine.  For example the pork belly is prepared as a pastrami, the entire preparation from before its even cooked, the spaetzle resembled french friends and even includes brussels sprout sauerkraut.  Some of the cocktails such as the Im-Port, featuring leather and tobacco bitters, sound really strange but when combined with the other components just work.  This a truly first class dining destination and one of the few places I've been to in Arizona I could see working in east coast cities such at Philly, NYC and Boston.

Awesome concept.  All six of the sauces are great.  Good beer.  Nice patio.  The brats are a bit on the peppery side.  German potato salad was a hot preparation - I was expecting the cold version with radishes and vinegar (no mayonnaise), but, it was good.  Pretzel was pretty basic.

As good as it gets in The Valley!  Probably closer to 4.5 stars.  The space at Virtù is warm and inviting.  My service was extraordinarily friendly and help.  Charred octopus truly may be the best dish in the area at the moment. Smoke duck breast was supurb!  Very minor, but the dish probably didn't need the foie gras tart.  The duck with frites and foie could stand on their own.    I'd go back.
