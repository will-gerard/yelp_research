On my way back from a memorable trip down Souff...I get to enjoy Charlotte Int'l for a bit.  Many restaurants (both local and national), shops, kiosks, etc and other spots to drain a few extra bucks out of you while you're 'trapped' here.  I do like the old school rocking chairs throughout the concourses. I like the charging stations everywhere as all the major airports have. I like the filtered  water refilling stations throughout. the airport as well.   I would LOVE a lil POS kiosk with some booze in it as well, so we can deal with the chatty passengers/seat kicking kids/loud talking mofo's that every flight seems to have.  Overall a great layout, long walks to connecting flights, comfy chairs, nice and helpful employees.  Can't ask for much more.   Thumbs up

This review has been sitting in the chamber for quite awhile...but I've been in a rut lately.  This will go along with it's soon to be companion review at SkyDive Las Vegas.  My buddies who were looking for a change of pace from the the boozing, partying, scoring, gambling, buffeting and uhhm other activities, decided to take my advice and try something different after everyone 'dried' out.  Well if 5 hours or so without drinking counts as drying out!   We got a group rate and after u pay ur $$, sign the appropriate waivers and watch the dvd safety clip.....you're ready to go!!  Jumbo airplane engine in the floor(or at least I think it is)...multiple cages above the engine to protect you in case you fall.  Spread those arms wide, bend those knees back and try to make yourself parallel/flat plane to the floor for maximum flight. I loved it!!  Only two guys got sick after the fact... I completely loved this experience of simulated freefall and just further whetted my appetite for my actual first skydive jump. Walls with cushions will protect u if ur scared.

One of our first stops for gas on our drive down to Loosanna to pick up my lil girl last month. Dad goes across the parking lot for his Mickey D coffee fix here in AZ and I see the Dunkin Donuts across the way.   So as a consumer of pop culture, ESPN watcher and avid listener of comics who've grown up back east proclaiming the virtues of this chain's coffee as being the best thing evaah (just like the NY pizza thing), I figured I'd give it a try.       Verdict- not impressed. 7-11 coffee is just as damn good. Pure n Simple    Altho the variety of donuts behind the case looked tempting and I guess they're gonna branch out to bagels when they come to CA. Either way...not making a special trip once they get to CA
