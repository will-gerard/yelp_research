I am extremely disappointed with Brown Road Animal Clinic, and would suggest taking your animals elsewhere.  My family and friends told me to stay away from Brown Road Animal Clinic, that they have had bad experience, but I wanted to give them a chance.  Boy was I wrong, and taken advantage of.  Never again, I should have listened to all my family and friends that had bad experiences with this clinic. We started with a Dr. McNulty as our pups vet, and she didn't even check my pups.  She looked them over, gave them shoots and out the door.  It felt like she had other things to do besides check my pups for health problems, maybe happy hour? My girlfriend went in, and met with Dr. Mike Zinn, and he was better. He found a few problems with my pups that Dr. McNulty didn't take the time for.  I was quoted and lied to multiple times about my pups costs. I asked why I was told something different before I made the appointment and the office lady said I don't know. Really, tell me this after I am there? This happened a few different times. I feel they are interested in making money at my pup's expense.  I called around and found out they are higher than other vets in the area.

Joann is an amazing matchmaker.  I have worked with many of matchmakers, but none like Joann.  She is very knowledgeable in matchmaking and understanding the dating scene.  Joann really cares about her clients, and is such a great resource of knowledge.   I would recommend Joann to anyone looking to understand dating, or wanting to meet the right person.   The biggest investment in life is a life partner.  Why not have an expert on your side to coach you all the way?  She helped me realize and understand about me, and what type of partners are for me.  To me this information was priceless.   I cant say enough great things about her.  I wish I would have used Joann years ago....
