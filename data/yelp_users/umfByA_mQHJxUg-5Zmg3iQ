My wife and I took my parents here.  The sweet and spicy fish is one of my favorite dishes in the Valley and will keep us going back for more.  My Dad loved the food and commented several times how that was a great meal.    We ordered Dragon Noodles, Yellow Curry for the boys, and the jalapeño fried rice.  YUMMY!!  Highly Recommend.    A little pricey but very much worth the expense.  Not an everyday lunch place in my opinion because of price but a great treat.

Must say this is one of my Favorite places to spend my money even better the Bestbuy and I love electronics.  I have always had a quality dinning experience be it in Oahu or here in Chandler.    My favorite dishes- all of them, you can't go wrong.  They even have fantastic dishes for children which are priced reasonably.   You must get the chocolate soufflé, if you go- order ahead as it takes 25 minutes to prepare.  I usually ask for an extra scoop of vanilla ice cream.  We go here for all of our special occasions.  You won't go wrong if you do too!!!  Butterfish! Even the meatloaf rules!!!

By far best pizza in Chandler, AZ.  I love the thin crust and the coal ovens give the pizza a great taste.  My boys and I love the pizza here.  My wife thinks the pizza is a little salty.  However - I wouldn't order pizza from anywhere else given a choice.  They never have coupons- and that is because its worth every penny.  Pizza is thin and ingredients are fresh.

Money. Pizza was fabulous. Almost worth moving north to be closer. Recommend it. My wife loved the French fries and so did my two boys. I thought pizza was great.

Has grown in popularity.    My kids love this place and have lots of fun making their own yogurt treat... honestly I would not eat one of their concoctions as they are usually unique mixes of cereal, fruit and gummy bears.  That is the magic of the place- an infinite mix of possibilities.  My wife usually take the kids here after they do something awesome and they love it.  They usually rotate a few different flavors and give free samples.  Highly recommend- watch for post dinner crowd as there are few seats- but a must try.

I am reviewing solely based on the food.  Expensive yes- Delicious yes- Over priced- darn hard to eat anywhere for less then 10 bucks anymore.  Get water and save yourself a few dollars. Sorry In and out is definitely outclassed by this place.

Have to say the food was OK- not sure if we ordered the right stuff.  Asked for White meat didn't get it... Service was horrible- credit card machine didn't work.  Food is very pricey for what they gave.   for 1 leg and 1 thigh fried chicken with side of rice and corn- cost me 12 bucks with Water to drink.  No lunch specials as well...   I will give it another try but for now- buyer beware.
