Nice space, across from the fascinating public library building. Interesting selection of wine. We had a couple of flights paired with cheese. Their cheese selection is vast! Better than many of the stores that sell cheese around the valley. The pairings were appropriate and all the wines were good to very good, although one of my reds was room temperature.   Food was very good-- cracker thin pizza with spicy sausage and a salad with filet mignon, pancetta and blue cheese. Service was great, although we were the only patrons there on a Sunday afternoon.   The only disappointment was that the unisex bathroom, while having an appealing decor, smelled as if it hadn't been cleaned in a couple of weeks. Eww.   I'd visit again, and just make sure I used the facilities elsewhere!

Ryan's is a great place to buy pet supplies. I like the fact that it is set up like a warehouse. No sales people bugging me when I just want to look. There are people there to help you find stuff when you need them. They also carry heavy items to the front for you. I would give it 5 stars, but it's too far from where I live to be convenient. I wish there was another location further north!

I like this little store. It's nothing compared to the giant store in north Scottsdale. However, I like shopping here because it's a little bit less crazy most of the time. They don't carry all the stuff (and no food court or bar-haha) that the other store has, but they still have most of the good stuff. I usually go there after shopping at Trader Joe's!

We found this place by chance, thank goodness. It is the best appliance store I've ever been in! Randy Rice has assisted us with several purchases. That guy knows EVERYTHING about the appliances they sell and never makes you feel like he's hard-selling. We've ended up with exactly what we hoped for each time we go in. The delivery and installation is always on time and trouble-free. No, they don't have the super cheap brands like big box stores, but they do have a moderate range of appliances (like GE) as well as luxury models (like Miele).  When you are looking for quality appliances and expert knowledge, definitely go here!

Sooo good! The donuts are always incredibly fresh and delicious. My favorite is the Old Fashioned. Craggy, crispy outside, soft inside. Oh my goodness. These are among the best I've had. The coffee is pretty tasty, too, especially compared to what I expected. It's robust and flavorful. The staff is friendly and efficient and of course, who can beat the price of $5 or less for breakfast? Try it! You won't regret it.

The good: helpful airport personnel, good restaurants (esp. Terminal 4), several options for parking, easy access to terminal 4 via sky train The bad: VERY confusing layout to drive through. I've lived here since 2006 and still use gps plus lots of cursing to navigate into and out of the airport.

Every location of In-n-Out Burger I've ever visited in AZ and CA has been the same: shockingly efficient, Stepford-like teenagers politely fulfilling my desires for meat and potatoes. The food is also always good. The burgers seem like they are actually made of meat instead of mystery fillers. The fries are crispy but not in an unnatural way.   Make sure you are aware of the not-so-secret menu. I usually get a burger protein-style, animal-style, with mustard instead of spread. They get it right every time. Just went there yesterday with out of town family guests and they love the place, too. It is a priority whenever they visit.   The location at Desert Ridge can get kind of busy, but they always get you through the drive-through line surprisingly quickly. I opt for drive-through when the place is busy, as it seems faster than when you order inside. Plus I am not a fan of smelling the ketchup-permeated air that fills the restaurant. Americans. We love our freaking ketchup.

This review is for the service dept. of Shasta pools, not a store.   I've never had a problem with the guys who came to do the work on my pool equipment. The problem is with the people who answer the phone. I noticed last time I called, I would be put on hold by the automated system for a long time (like maybe 10 minutes or more). The only way to get to talk to someone was to leave a message then I got a call back within minutes. I thought that was really strange. It happened twice. So I scheduled a service call.   A few days before it was going to happen, I had something come up and needed to cancel. I called, again had to leave a message after being on hold to speak to a person. When the rep. looked on the schedule, she said it was never even put in the system! Too strange for me. I'm not calling them again.

We went out to the Schnepf Farm Peach Festival a few weeks ago. It was a bust. Hard little green peaches and some very sad captive animals were detractors from the pleasant scenery.   Since we had driven all the way to the other side of the valley, we decided to look around. We stopped by the Queen Creek Olive Mill and picked up some nice olive oil and fig balsamic vinegar. Seeing a sign for the Pork Shop, we drove a few miles further down the road.   We bought a several items including Fat Tire Beer brats, pepper cured bacon and some breakfast sausage. We also indulged in a couple of hot burritos they sell there out of a little warming cabinet behind the counter. The burritos were very distinctive, smokey and juicy.   We ate the brats right away. They were definitely some of the better brats we've gotten in AZ. The seasoning was just right.   Now, for the big deal... I just made the pepper cured bacon today. Hands down, the best bacon I've ever had. It was very tender, had the slight bite of cracked black pepper balanced by a very subtle sweetness. I baked mine in the oven at 375 for about 20 minutes and it was perfectly crisp.   I wish The Pork Shop was a lot closer so I could stock up more often. This just may be the impetus needed to make me go buy that extra fridge for the garage. Making a "bacon run" to Queen Creek with a cooler soon!

I'm not sure what I was thinking when I signed up for a membership at this place. The massages ranged from mediocre to pretty good. My problem is with the misleading business practices they use. Supposedly you can cancel at the end of your contract, but due to some red tape, they did not cancel my membership after they received my written notice and continue to charge me 49.95 per month. Now they say I have to pay them for 2 more months of membership or otherwise I guess they'll continue the monthly charges and eventually try to sue me to collect.  If you go to Massage Envy, you'd be wise to avoid signing anything. They don't play fair even if there is some loophole in the contract, I can't believe this is how you create goodwill and ongoing relationships with your customers.

Just found this place recently. Love the fresh food- wow the chicken is great, very heavy on the garlic so make sure you have your breath mints handy if you eat there for lunch on a work day! I thought the place looked clean, despite what some people here have said. Not really what I'd call "a hole in the wall," but just a casual Mom and Pop joint. Perfect for this kind of food.

The staff at this bowling alley is really helpful. The place is clean, including the bathrooms. I'm not a bowling aficionado, so I can't say if it's up to pro standards, but it was perfect for our work party on a Saturday afternoon. They have Kiltlifter and Hop Shock IPA on tap! They also served pizza, salad, wings and some other munchies. I didn't try the food but it looked pretty good and seemed to be enjoyed by my coworkers. Another big plus is that the rental shoes and balls were not all skanky looking! You know what I mean :).

I like all the Sprouts locations I've visited, but this is my most frequented one. I go once or twice a week for good and fairly priced produce. I hardly ever get a disappointing fruit or veggie from Sprouts.   The fun and adventurous thing about this location is that most of the customers at any given time seem to be retirees. In the parking lot, if you see back-up lights on a car, you'd better run! They don't look and they don't pause before backing out. Yes, it may take them making a 7 point turn to get out of that spot, but by golly, they are not stopping for man nor beast. I usually just walk in the gravel medians! Sigh... I look forward to being a retiree myself one day and not giving a flip about what anyone else is doing.

This cozy little strip mall restaurant is a gem. We went in on a Saturday at lunch, and it was not busy at all. The server was a sweet, mature fellow who made good recommendations for beer. Service was NOT especially slow the day we visited, as others have experienced.   The tamale sampler offered a red, a green and a "white" (?) tamale. They were all good, but the green tamale was our favorite. We had  Seco de Pollo and Bandeja Paisa. The meats were tender, the beef deliciously smokey, plantains perfectly fried... I can't criticize any part of the meal. We had Xingu Black beer-- smooth and perfect to go with the comfort food entrees.   Even though we were very full, we didn't want to pass up the desserts. We split a large slice of flan de coco. It looked sort of like a cheese cake with two layers. The top is a firm-ish flan and the bottom is a sort of crumbly, very coconut-y cake. So good, and not too sweet.   To summarize the food: it doesn't taste like restaurant food. It tastes better-- like your grandma made it just for you with lots of love. I hope we have a chance to return and try more menu selections soon!

Oak's buttermilk pancakes, how do I love thee?Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of Buttery Richness and ideal taste.  I know not how they achieve the salty, creamy, sweet flavor of these humble-looking flapjacks. The perfect crispy brown exterior gives way to reveal the perfect middle that is neither too cakey nor too thin. No need for additional butter and one considers foregoing even the cheap supermarket syrup which rather detracts from the beautiful perfection of the cakes.   I can't speak for any of the other menu items aside from the fried eggs I order with my pancakes-- perfectly fine, by the way. Just go for the pancakes and forget everything else. Maybe I can smuggle some warm maple syrup in next time I dine there. Hmmm....

Spent the morning at The Boulders' spa. Fantastic massage, locker room, showers, steam shower, pool and cafe. This is a very peaceful place to spend a few hours or a whole day.   My friend stayed at the resort a couple years ago and the casitas were really nice, too. Luxury and peacefulness all the way. Highly recommended!

Brambley Hedge has a very clean facility, lots of caring volunteers, and desire to further the education of the public about domestic rabbits.   If you are thinking about adopting a house rabbit, check out Brambley Hedge. They have lots of adorable, unique bunnies who need homes. Spend some time learning about how to care for your new pet and ask the rescue volunteers lots of questions before you make a decision.

We moved to Phoenix from Nashville a few years ago. There are lots of things we don't miss about Nashville, but we really miss the music scene (and no it's not all top 40 country music). Stinkweeds fills a little hole that was in my life after leaving Nashville. Cool, independent music selections in a surprisingly small shop.

This review is based on two visits. The first was during restaurant week with a group of friends. I had the short ribs and was wowed by the sweet/savory tender meat and the delicious cheddar mashed potatoes that came with the entree. The serving sizes of all the food was so ample, I mis-judged the capacity of my stomach and overate. The service was fine that night. I remember our waitress being very acommodating and prompt. We sat in the pleasant, quiet patio area and had a really nice dinner.   I went back with my husband a month or so later after telling him how good it was. This time, I ordered the nightly special, a grilled tuna dish. The tuna itself was fine, actually seemed like a high quality piece of fish. My criticism was that they served a large piece of tuna unsliced. It made the fish kind of chewy because I had to cut off large pieces with a less-than-ideal steak knife.   So, the worst part was that the service was poor enough that even I was annoyed. We sat and waited for our dishes to be cleared and our bill to be presented for probably 20-30 minutes. I'm usually pretty tolerant of mediocre service, but man! If it was like this every time, I would definitely have to avoid the place even though I like the food. I plan to give it another go, hoping the poor service was a fluke.

This new Sprouts location is convenient and attractive. It's set up like all the other Sprouts, so it's easy to navigate the aisles. In general, Sprouts has above average produce, a good selection of vitamins and supplements as well as foods with mostly  acceptable nutrition profiles for health freaks like me.   I shop at a Sprouts store at least once a week and am almost always very happy with the experience. The only criticism of this location is the parking lot. It's kind of treacherous during busy periods.

I've quickly become hooked on this tiny sandwich shop. Maybe it's the way it makes me feel like I'm in a small town, not a strip mall in Scottsdale. Maybe it's the delicious, huge sandwiches and salads. I hope it doesn't get too popular, cuz then I won't have anywhere to sit and eat lunch! I love it.

Bonnie's Barkery carries most of the high-end, organic, natural, (etc., etc.) dog and cat foods available in major markets. I like the fact that they don't sell anything that is not natural, such as cheap rawhide chews. Lots of great interactive dog toys, deer antlers, tough toys, frozen raw diets and bones. We are so fortunate to have this great shop in our neighborhood!

Sunday afternoon is the busiest time here! Personally, I could live without the LOLs pushing preservative-laden factory food on me. I'd also like to see more grass-fed and pastured animal products. I had visitors from out of town who are also Costco members where they live. They were surprised the Costco employees actually checked our card when we went in and our receipt when we left. This location may be more militant than others.

This is a nice, small local shop that carries some high quality dog food. The have frozen, raw dog food, too.   They have some real fancy clothes for tiny dogs. I bought some awesome hiking shoes for my larger sized dogs here a few years ago- Ruffwear.   The location is very convenient if you live in the Cave Creek area. It's near Safeway and Target, so it's easy to combine shopping trips.   Parking is usually available close to the store, although for a huge parking lot it often has surprisingly few open spaces!

We went to Los Reyes de la Torta last weekend for the first time. I was excited about the food, but wondered if it would be difficult to order and about the standards of cleanliness.   Both concerns were completely unfounded. The staff there were English-speaking and very friendly. The place appeared to be quite clean, too!   We ordered two agua frescas. One was mango and the other was cantaloupe/watermelon on the waitress' recommendation. Wow! Both were so fresh and delicious. Not too sweet, either.   Our sandwiches were the del Rey and the Arizona. They were both huge and served on some really good sandwich buns. I just couldn't believe my eyes when I saw all the stuff they squeezed into both sandwiches! Ham, pork sirloin, chorizo, sausage, egg, avocado, jalapenos, breaded beef-- probably some things I'm forgetting.   Somehow the flavors meld together to create the most savory combination with just a little heat. I had to stop after eating half my sammy due to threat of gastric explosion. Hubby ate the entire del Rey. Guess skinny guys must have a hollow leg where they put giant meals.   I loved my meal. It's the kind of thing you'd see on "thisiswhyyourefat.com" but soooooo worth it. We will be going back and plan to blow our out-of-town guests' minds with this place next time they visit! I forgot to mention our meal was less than $30 including tip.

I've only been there once, but I liked it and got a good hair cut. They fixed my hair after I had a less than great cut elsewhere. Convenient location, nice shop, reasonable pricing (similar to everywhere else). I will return and may change my rating to 5 stars after I know them better!

Craft brews on tap!!! Get lit before you spend lotsa money on stuff that you don't need but it looks so good you can't help yourself.   This place is humongous, not always super crowded, clean and packed to the rafters with fabulous food. Best huge, corporate shopping venue in town.

I am always skeptical about any restaurant that opens in my neighborhood. Many have been disappointing, at best. Heart and Soul Cafe restored my faith.   I've only eaten there once and it was for breakfast. I was delighted to see a full two pages of interesting, creative options for breakfast. This place is run by someone who is interested in food, not just selling stuff. I had the breakfast basil sandwich. It wasn't just an egg on a crappy bagel, but an egg with crispy bacon, creamy goat cheese, fresh basil and tomato on a soft/chewy bagel. The side of potatoes was a mixture of white, sweet and blue potatoes. I'm not certain, but I think they are baked rather than fried. In any case, they were not at all greasy and were entirely delicious.   Service was fine and the place is comfortable and clean. It's the kind of place I'd be willing to drive 30 minutes to visit. All the better that I can WALK there. I can't wait to go back again and again!!! Hope dinner is as good as breakfast.

I am a fan of Trader Joe's in general, but this location is my favorite amongst those that I frequent.   Parking: I'm always concerned I won't find a spot, but I always do. They have a lot of shady parking spaces. In Phoenix, that earns at least a star, right there!  Staff: friendly, efficient and not too weird.  Cleanliness of store: clean and organized. I haven't been to any TJ's that weren't.  Product selection/prices: good to great. Of course, there are things you just can't get at TJ's but the stuff you CAN get is high quality. Grass fed NY strip steaks for 10.99/lb??? GET OUT!  Biggest criticism is that sometimes the fruit is nasty! I've wasted money on inedible pints of figs, etc. It's hit or miss, though, some stuff is very good. I just don't concentrate my produce buying in TJ's.   The biggest reason this is my favorite location is that it is not as cut-throat as the one on FLW Blvd. The Scottsdale Ladies up there are friggin' ruthless and make shopping a very unpleasant experience at times. Not TJ's fault at all, just a characteristic of that location.

I've eaten at BluBurger Grille on North Scottsdale Road at least 3 times. Each time has been a good experience. The food quality is high. Yes, it's an $11-15 burger but it is not "pink slime!"    Tonight I had a grass-fed Angus beef burger with goat cheese and caramelized onions sans bun. Perfect for a grain-free diet, cooked perfectly, perfectly delicious.  Also had a really quite good glass of Mclaren Vale Shiraz, so I can't complain!  Service was prompt and friendly. We sat outside and had a nice view of the mountains during sunset. I guess the few crummy Yelp reviews aren't hurting them too much as it was a full house on a Thursday night. Those of us who keep going back need to share our satisfaction with others.

I was excited when I found out there was a French bakery in Fountain Hills. While working there the other day, I stopped by to pick up a few pastries.   I was pretty disappointed in the croissants and chocolate croissants. They tasted like what you'd get from Safeway. These were not as flakey and yeasty tasting as the good croissants I've eaten. I've made them myself and expected these to be at least as good as my amateur attempts. Not so.   I would call the pastries "OK" and would consider going again to try the bread.

Just tried Bryan's BBQ a few days ago. It's very near where we live, so I had high hopes for it being good! Not very many unique, high quality restaurants way out here in the "boonies." We ordered take-out food.   We ordered a whole barbecued chicken and a pound of brisket. For sides, we got some of the olive cole slaw and french fries. The chicken was really quite good. I ate a breast and it was moist and tender. So many times, the breast meat is dry and flavorless but not here! There was just a bit of BBQ sauce coating the skin. The sauce was slightly sweet but not cloyingly so. The bread and butter jalapeno included with the chicken was a wonderful cross between a chile and a pickle. I will order a side of these next time.   The brisket was also tender and smokey. They sent it with just a little BBQ sauce mixed in. I wish I would have asked for the hot BBQ sauce. Guess I am just a heat junkie. The sides were just OK. Nothing too good or bad. The fries were pretty much limp by the time we got them home, but that may be unavoidable with take-out food.   For about $30, we got enough food to feed two people for two + days. Not bad! We will definitely return to Bryan's BBQ to try some of the other menu items. I'm looking forward to tasting that Firebird! Next time, maybe we'll dine in and drink some of the good beer they have available, too.  Addendum 12/12/09: I tried the Firebird and it was very hot. The bbq sauce is orange/habanero. I thought I was eating a piece of orange, but it was actually about 1/2 of a habanero pepper!!! That was the most violent reaction I've ever gotten from my GI tract to such a small piece of food. Firebird is very good, but don't eat the pieces of habanero.

The pulled squash sandwich is unique and satisfying. They also have a special sandwich for summer that consists of slices of flavorful red tomatoes, a delicious creamy dressing, and smoked sea salt on two thick slabs of buttered and grilled bread. Wow, wow, oh my God. That is a sammy I'll not soon forget and will attempt to emulate in my own kitchen!   A few weak links in the chain for me: french fries always seem very soggy but I admit this is judging them on a take-out basis. The slaw and tater salad to me are not as unique and expertly spiced as compared with the rest of the food.   There are so many strong points to Bryan's that the weak points hardly detract. Highly recommend you eat here regularly!

We go out for breakfast only occasionally, so it's kind of a big deal to get some good food. Today, we decided to forego the usual haunts and try Firecreek Coffee. I was worried we'd be disappointed. That we'd end up choking down stale toast prepared by a teenager with an attitude.  My worries were completely unfounded, though. The short, but thoughtful menu of breakfast food is bolstered by a nice array if muffins and pastries on display. I chose to try the poached egg with country toasted bread, strawberry jam, butter, fresh berries and a wedge of brie drizzled with honey. My husband had granola with steamed milk (yum), and we shared a huge bran muffin studded with berries. I also indulged in a cup of cappuccino that puts Starbucks' offering to shame.  All the food was fresh and presented in a very appealing manner. I couldn't believe how inexpensive it was, either. Our bill was only around $22, and that included a bag of coffee beans to take home! The inside of the shop has a comfy sofa and plenty of bistro tables. The patio is a lovely and quiet place to read the paper while sipping coffee. The staff were friendly, polite and made amazingly good food and beverages for us.  This was my favorite breakfast I've had in the valley since I moved here four years ago. It was just so unexpected and so charming. We will be going back again very soon!

Lamar's has just surpassed Rainbow Donuts on Cave Creek Rd. as the best donuts I've had in Phoenix. All the donuts are fresh and there are many varieties. Many are freaking gigantic, but they do have normal sized-donuts, too! Their coffee is pretty good for this kind of restaurant. Reminded me of the standard Starbuck's offering. I'd get it again, but wouldn't go there JUST for the coffee. Clean, cute store and friendly, helpful staff makes this a good bet for brekky sweets!

We've been going to the new location and the old location for three years. We always get fresh, good-tasting food here. The pizzas are very good- crust is between thin and thick and tastes really good. The fennel sausage they use on some of the pizzas is unique and addictive.   The salads are surprisingly fresh and thoughtfully prepared. I often get the tuna Nicoise or Greek salad. The salads are also large, so you could definitely share one. The new location has a tastefully decorated, comfortable room and as well as a nice patio. Yes, the prices are higher than some lesser restaurants, but I never mind paying the bill because the food is always good!

Just tried the gluten-free crust pizzas from Uncle Louie last night. I was very happy that it was much better than the frozen variety available in the grocery store! It was good! I've had gluten-free crusts at several places in the north valley and have gotten so disappointed I stopped even trying new places. I just get salad instead.   Glad I tried the GF pizza at Uncle Louie. It was crispy and had a nice toasty flavor. The toppings were fresh and flavorful as ever. Very good GF pizza-- recommended!

Our house was badly in need of new exterior paint. I contacted several local painting companies for estimates. Some never bothered to get back to me, or did so after several days. Pretty much what I've come to expect for most service providers these days.   Mike from Crash of Rhinos called me within hours of when I sent my email inquiry. He was professional, informative and courteous. He was able to come to my house soon after we spoke and explained the service they provide. He gave me a full written estimate along with a good description of the different types of paint available. There were also options as to whether I wanted them to paint things such as our view fence.  All that was great and I was very impressed, however the best part was yet to come... After looking at the paint sample booklets and choosing 2 or 3 schemes I liked, Kim brought samples over and put a little on the house so I could see how they really looked. She also took a photo and had the paint store make some mock-ups of the house with different color schemes. Kim also contacted our HOA and submitted our proposal to paint. It was so nice not to have to hassle with figuring out which forms to use, where to send it, etc.   The workers were delayed in starting by a rare several days of rain. They ended up doing the entire house over the course of a couple of days. The workers were quiet and courteous. The paint looks great. They cleaned up after themselves and didn't wreck any of my plants. I couldn't be happier! And the price paid was within dollars of the estimate I got from another company.   Thanks, Crash of Rhinos, for not only doing a great job painting my house, but also for showing this city how to run a service business!

This AJ's location is clean and well-organized. Some of the products offered are such junk food it sort of disappoints me. I know it's not a health-food store, but I do wish they'd carry more real food type products.   The produce is always good, though you will pay for the quality (I don't mind). Wine selection is good and I found the wine guy to be friendly and turned us on to some wines we would have never considered and we can also fend for ourselves with wine. Just sayin' YMMV.   Best thing about this location is the meat counter. The regular  burger patties are fantastic as are the grass fed steaks. Some of the best I've found in the valley. If you buy something here, you can count on it being fresh and of high quality.

My friend had the idea to go to Rita's Kitchen on New Year's Day. I am not a big brunch buffet fan. It's usually a woeful disappointment at best and a waste of time and money.   Rita's Kitchen was one of the best buffets I've ever experienced. Everything I tried was very fresh and high quality even at 1:45 in the afternoon. Never thought I'd say it, but the blackberries on the fruit bar were the highlight of my meal. Also had brie, manchego, salami, lox, grilled vegetables, prime rib, crab claws, shrimp cocktail and scampi, skirt steak, salad, and lots of champagne. Service was great, view of the mountains and location on the patio was fantastic.   This was a memorable experience. I would strongly recommend Rita's to a friend and will return myself.

We shared a taco "sampler" of one of each of their tacos. The halibut taco was the standout fave for me, though they were all good. My prickly pear margarita was fruity and not made from a sickly sweet mix, as far as I could tell. The elote was addictive. We had attentive, effective service. Pricing was such as I'd expect for a resto. in a boutique hotel. Really no complaints at all.   I just had to laugh when I read Yelp reviews that gave me the impression this place might be a little too cool for the likes me. I thought it was kinda more a post-modern upscale junkstore aesthetic. I LOVED it. It was very casual and not stuffy at all! The hand dryers in the bathroom are worth a trip to the potty, too.

I've been going to Visual Impact for a few years now. I originally went for the Oiudad cut from Alberto. Then I realized with or without curls, he is able to give me the most consistently good hair cut I've had since moving to AZ. I never have weird long pieces or awkward spots like I did from other stylists. I guess it has to do with knowing what curly or wavy hair does when it's dry. I like this place and recommend it to anyone--curly or otherwise!

I bought a water softener from these guys a few years ago. I like that when I call, I either speak to someone right away or get a return call quickly. They notify me annually when it's time to change my whole house water filter. The installers and service people are prompt, neat and courteous. The equipment has worked perfectly.  When we needed a water heater, I got a couple of estimates but ended up purchasing from American Home Water. They gave the best price plus my previous experience told me they were trustworthy.  Now I have a terrific new hot water heater that was installed by a friendly and efficient tech. This is a professional organization. I highly recommend them.

I've been using this company for a few years and couldn't be happier with their services. We've bought both a water softener and water heater from them. The prices are very competitive and they have a superior level of professionalism in their services.   They always answer the phone and get my service scheduled quickly. The workmen are punctual, neat, and friendly. Today, Gerardo came to do a filter change. He was polite and quickly completed the work. I highly recommend this company!

We ate at Ari Sushi recently. I see that friendly-looking fellow at Tatum and Cave Creek Rd. a lot and wanted to patronize his place. It's in a strip mall and has a neighborhood kind of vibe. The service was good, clean and casual dining area. The fish seemed very fresh and the maki was delightful with good (not mushy) rice. Prices were very reasonable. This is at least as good as Toyama and closer to home! I really can't fault them. We'll definitely return!

Stopped by Hot Dog Guy after a hike today. He was located on Cave Creek Road in front of El Encanto's market. I had a Chicago Dog and hubby had a Wild West Wiener. The bill was less than $10 and the dogs were tasty. He uses Vienna Beef dogs and nice, fluffy poppy seed buns from Basha's. The Chicago Dog had lots of tomatoes, a pickle spear and some good sport peppers. The Wild West Wiener had BBQ sauce, bacon, and Frito's corn chips.  I will definitely stop by again for fast, cheap, good food!

Caveat to my review: I have always been a burrito eater and only recently decided to start trying tacos. I had a carne asada taco and a pastor taco. The pastor was kind of barbecue-y and they also put some nice guac on the taco. They serve it with a side of light-colored salsa-- is it tomatillo? The entire thing was a multi-layered flavor treat.   The carne asada taco was also pretty good, but maybe I'm just not a carne asada fan. I've tried a few of these tacos at different places and found the meat lacking distinctive flavor. I guess I'm wanting either smokiness, chile heat or some other spice to jazz up the steak meat. However, the steak was very tender and the tortillas are moist and have a nice, mild masa flavor. The salsa that comes alongside the tacos definitely helps bump them up a rung on the ratings scale.   We had a side of chips and guac. which was very creamy and mild. Bean and cheese burrito my husband ordered was very, very creamy and had a wonderful pinto bean flavor. Beer was only $2.75 each for the imported bottles we got. The total bill was around $25. I consider that pretty standard for Scottsdale and Phoenix for casual lunch for two people.   If you want super cheap, homogenized food, you should stick to Taco Bell. If you want GOOD, local restaurant food, go to America's Taco Shop. I will definitely be returning. I hope to try a burrito next time!

We visited Al's last summer, excited that they opened a place nearby. I have had Italian Beef in Chicago at several places and locally, too. I'm not a connoisseur, per se, but I am a foodie and I've tasted enough Italian Beef to know what's fresh and what isn't.   The beef sandwich at this location was just really not that tasty and the fries were very limp and greasy! I was so disappointed. Maybe I will try it again, but with Joey's of Chicago near my home, I'll likely just stick with their more reliably fresh food.

We went to Culver's last night for the first time since they built the one in our neck of the woods on Cave Creek Road. I'll make this review brief because we didn't eat a full meal, just went for some frozen custard. We've all had frozen custard at little places we love in the Midwest, so were excited to try Culver's. When we pulled up, the air smelled strongly of fried fish as it was "walleye special" night. It wasn't the most appetizing aroma, but hey, we Midwesterners love our fish fries.   First off, I never knew Culver's was a fast food joint. Very similar to McDonald's, you order at a counter off a huge menu on the wall. The only choices for dine-in frozen custard were vanilla, chocolate or some flavor of the day. Then you were encouraged to add various candies and snacks to mix in as in a Dairy Queen Blizzard. In a case at the side of the lobby, there were containers of different frozen custard flavors that sounded pretty good, like chocolate-covered strawberry and bonfire s'mores. Unfortunately, there was none to be found except in those cartons for carry-out.   The chocolate frozen custard I tasted had a good texture but was amongst the sweetest ice creams or custards I've ever had. I would not order it again.  The other major criticism is that while we were waiting for our order, employees kept rushing past us and saying "excuse me" in a somewhat exasperated way. We finally figured out that we were supposed to go sit down and wait for our orders so we wouldn't be "in the way." Woulda been nice if one of them had suggested that instead of just seeming annoyed that we were standing in the order counter/lobby area.  Whatevs. Would not recommend and would not return. If you already love Culver's from eating there in your childhood, you'd probably be happy with it now. If you've never been there before, make sure your expectations are set according to the reality of what they present. I would choose In 'n' Out burger any day over this place and go get gelato at That's Amore afterward.

Here's what I love about Habit Burger: 1. Can order and pay online 2. No problems getting custom designed meal. Lettuce wrap instead of bun- absolutely!  3. Nice shop and employees.  4. Fair prices for quality food. 6. Convenient location.  7. Fresh ingredients combined in a delicious way.   My favorites: mushroom swiss burger in lettuce wrap plus bacon! Cobb salad is big and fresh. You can eat at least kind of paleo-style at this place without much effort. I've eaten there many times and never feel lousy afterward when I choose carefully!

I returned from an out of town business trip to find a kitchen sink that refused to drain. We tried unclogging it ourselves to no avail. Finally, we decided to get a professional to help.  We called Gabe early in the morning and he was able to come to our house later that day. He unclogged the sink and also straightened out the mess of pipes the former homeowner had created trying to put in sink accessories. Now it looks like it should under there instead of a leaky, complicated mess! I thought the charge for fixing everything was fair although I don't have much to compare it to. It was less than I figured it would be.   I waited about a month to write this review, just to make sure there were no problems. No problems whatsoever! I'm really happy we found a trustworthy pro to help us and will not hesitate to call Copperline Plumbing in the future.

This is a convenient location, out of the hustle and bustle of the main part of Desert Ridge shopping center. My dogs enjoy going into the store to check out the wide variety of TREATS and CHEWS! There is an entire aisle of desiccated animal parts (ew, I know-- but the canines dig it) and the pricing is reasonable compared to some other boutique pet stores.   They sell Nature's Variety/Instinct frozen raw food and the price is actually pretty good compared to other places I've checked including online. I'm glad this place opened on the north side.

I'm not sure why we had been using some of the local big name companies for pool equipment repair. I had a recent experience with one of the biggies not answering their customer service line at all (??) then failed to actually put my appointment on their schedule when I did finally get through. I decided I should look for a different kind of service. I consulted Yelp and called a couple small pool maintenance businesses. The first one did not answer and never returned my call.  Joe with Pacific Blue Pools & Spas answered and told me he would probably be able to come by later the same day. He showed up on time, was courteous and professional. He was able to figure out what the problem was (motherboard cooked in my salt water chlorine generator) in short order. My unit was still under warranty so he was able to get the part and replace it within a week. I appreciate dealing with a responsive professional and will definitely patronize and recommend him.

Visited one day this week at lunch time. The wait for my juice was reasonable- maybe 5-10 minutes. The service was prompt and professional. I liked the little tables they had and waited there for my order.   The juice itself tasted good, if not just a tad sweeter than I would consider perfect. It was called "Toxin Flush" or something like that. It was a blend of parsley, apple, ginger and maybe one other thing I've forgotten. It was just a little vegetable-y and a little spicy from the ginger. They gave me a choice of having it on ice or not (no ice!).   The menu looks to be limited to the pre-designed selections. I don't think you can create your own combination. The price was lower than many other juice places and the location is convenient. Even though the huge parking lot is often completely full at lunch time, I found a spot right in front of the store the day I went.   I will definitely visit Nekter again and try one of the other juice offerings.

Was driving by at lunch time with a bit of time to kill. When I saw that they had juice I decided to stop in and try it.   I had a huge kale salad with pine nuts, romano cheese and dried currants. It was fresh and I thought it was a unique offering. Drank a cup of great coffee (from Cartel, I believe) and thoroughly enjoyed my Bruce Lee juice (carrot, ginger... Plus some other stuff).   Parking was no problem and they have a nice, albeit very noisy, patio seating area. Staff was prompt, knowledgable and courteous. Prices are in the higher end of the range for lunch, but really about the same as other restaurants of similar caliber.   I would definitely return and recommend to friends.
