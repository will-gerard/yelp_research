We turned to Greyhound to get from Phoenix to Tucson. We were going to rent a car, but picking up in Phoenix and dropping off in Tucson for 5 days was over $600 at one of the cheaper rental car agencies. That seemed crazy, so we bought one-way tickets on Greyhound for 3 passengers for about $40.   Was there a better deal online? Interestingly enough, the internet special costs more.   Would we save money on our tickets if we purchased ahead? No, but Mr. L bought our tickets a week ahead anyway, since the 2:30pm Sunday bus was the only time that actually worked for us. He printed out our tickets, which said we were confirmed. That Sunday would be Daylight Savings, but it was Arizona, which didn't have a time change.  That Sunday when we showed up at 2pm for our 2:30pm bus, we learned that they'd changed the time to 1:30pm. The Daylight Savings in other states affected the schedule. We should have confirmed our "confirmed" tickets. The station agent changed us to a 5:30pm bus, and we were bummed that we'd have a few hours to kill and miss out on time with Mr. L's parents. And they'd have to find the bus station in the dark - shoot.  Lesson learned? Buying tickets ahead with Greyhound isn't the best idea. If you do, confirm them, as the schedule may change.  With hours to kill in the Greyhound Station, my son started playing video games at $1 a pop, and Mr. L and I gathered our thoughts. There was some scary looking food sitting under heat lamps in the Cactus Caf√©. We rented two lockers to stow our luggage for $3 each for 3 hours and split in a cab for a while to go anywhere but the bus station.  When we returned closer to our new departure time, the lines for the buses were confusing. The line for Tucson was not the line for our bus. It seemed like everything was backwards here. Luckily we asked, or we might've missed our bus again. By the time we boarded our bus, many seats were taken. Ichabod headed to the back of the bus, and a kind gentleman cleared the 3-seat rear spot for us.   There was a bathroom near the back, which Mr. L suggested I avoid entering. He said it was a basic hole (outhouse style) with an empty jar of hand-sanitizer. Good to have the bare-bones bathroom if you really need it, but ick.  The driver made a bunch of announcements in English, then in Spanish. He meant business. I was glad when he told passengers to use headsets for their music, since initially a nearby passenger graced us with his music. Now we only got to see his seated dance moves, which were actually pretty good.   +2 affordable prices +2 capable driver -2 changing the schedule after had a "confirmed" ticket -1 for only one agent working the line  +2 having a bathroom on bus -1 condition of bathroom +1 lockers in Greyhound station -1 for the clusterf*ck of confusion of lines to get on buses - advanced degrees don't help here, be ready to ask questions  Grand total: 2 stars  Overall, we were glad not to spend over $600 on a rental car or inconvenience our friends or family by asking for a very long ride. We learned that we need to confirm or buy tickets last-minute like most Greyhound riders. Hanging out in a Greyhound station is not my idea of fun. We would ride Greyhound again, but proceed with caution.

Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarium is a privately run zoo, aquarium, and park geared toward families. We visited on a hot afternoon recently and saw a lot of animals that appeared to be well-cared for.   I am generally zoo-averse. I think it has something to do with having seen "Gorillas in the Mist" and seeing some zoos where the animals are cooped up in cages that are too small for them to live a happy life. I'd rather watch the animals on PBS or go on safari and see the animals in their own habitat. That being said, I am okay with places that take care of animals that are already not in the wild, as long as the conditions are good.   Wildlife World Zoo's monkeys were purchased from an overseas meat trade (being in a zoo is better than being eaten, I think!). Some of the animals were donated by people who had them and didn't know what to do with them. Some animals were bred in captivity.   I thought that the tortoise and the animals in the petting zoo could've used more supervision from zoo staff. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eE4MUd3m6j6yISWjEYjyPQ?select=hvL9zbLpCQLv-ACZ73fI2g I didn't see any guests abusing the animals, but I hope there are cameras or enough staff present to make sure that it never happens. Many animal exhitbits are interactive, and I didn't notice zoo personnel near all of the interactive exhibits.  When you visit the Congo Cooker, they don't provide straws in order to protect the animals. In this case, they're putting the animals first, which is great.  Highlights for us included:  + Feeding the parrots cut apples which they ate out of our hands. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eE4MUd3m6j6yISWjEYjyPQ?select=CGDdCL2Euu0FU7GFwXuZ_Q + Riding the safari train ride where we saw lots of animals. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eE4MUd3m6j6yISWjEYjyPQ?select=XBZ0cTUr0TVos5IKBmpoPw + Petting the stingray, sea star, and lobster. + Seeing the baby animals.  Tips and other info:  * If you're going during hot weather, visit during the morning before it gets scorching. Save the aquarium for last, since it's cooler inside.  * There are coupons available for discounts of admission in the Entertainment book and local newspaper.  * Tiburon Restaurant is located on the grounds of Wildlife World Zoo and has lovely views of the aquarium. We didn't eat here, though it appears to have nice ambiance and an extensive menu with a variety including a kids' menu. http://www.tiburonrestaurant.net  * The playground is downwind of the petting zoo, so it doesn't smell great there. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eE4MUd3m6j6yISWjEYjyPQ?select=CnTTkQrivcm6QGJvHrnytw  There was one goat in the petting zoo that was especially aggressive with us, which wasn't that fun. We hadn't purchased any feed, so he settled for our clothing. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eE4MUd3m6j6yISWjEYjyPQ?select=A75NiwFXuPt7lwdZXJEUTw All in all, it was a very fun afternoon and a very stimulating place to take kids.

During a recent road trip, a chef friend sent me a link to www.roadfood.com so I could try some interesting eateries along the drive from Green Valley to Goodyear. The site suggested Lo-Lo's, and Yelpers agreed. We didn't have to make a major detour off the freeway.  We parked on the street and entered a modest restaurant with bars on the window. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=KUUUNkwR7yzcX2o38AYTQQ No biggie. We received a warm welcome and got friendly service.  We ordered:  * 2 waffles with 3 pieces of chicken - I liked the waffles a lot. I still am not sure I "get" chicken with waffles, but I'm testing it out. I liked the chicken, but wasn't completely blown away by it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=3fY_2vL-zR4xXiKuhDjRgA * 1 plain waffle for our 5-year-old - Thumbs up from the kid. * Grits - Lumpy and plain, but still nice in a simple carb sort of way. As a California girl, I know almost nothing about grits.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=UP5-xhOoSN3C3JLURcrXJA * Chili and corn muffin - The chili was made with beans and beef, and was delicious. The corn muffin seemed pretty dry - waffles are way better here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=PojMqwuCAdilemZILlH1AA * Mac n' cheese - Creamy and satisfying. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=apV6OcH9iItBhrm8An33nw * Collard greens - Spicy, the flavor seemed a bit muddled, but it was a-okay.  * Red velvet cake - This was one of the best RV cakes I've tried. Incredibly moist (how did they do it?), very sweet, with fresh pecans on the frosting. I recommend ordering a slice to go, since you'll likely be to full to enjoy it after eating all this heavy food. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=l12Isv2RMc5q0LRuYmD4wA  I was glad to have found this special soul food restaurant. We left feeling totally stuffed and very impressed.

We visited our friends in Goodyear and I was kind of psyched to revisit Taste of Italy 2 where we had pizza the last time. Our local friends wanted to take us to Grimaldi's instead, their favorite pizzeria about 20 minutes away. Being the Yelpcurious sort, I was game to try this much hyped place. The downside to a place that has been hyped is that one's expectations are higher.   We ordered:  * Mediterranean Salad - Tasted fresh and good, but the dressing wasn't very balanced. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=ARQro-dR-8Hd90yb1yUyAQ * Pizza half plain cheese, half with basil and tomatoes http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=SbHD7fVvL32LgaUIpCBq9Q * Pizza with sausage, pepperoni, and basil http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=wl7YMUaOquTxdYgR4SG6Hg * Louis Martini Cabernet - for our friend * Red Sangria - for our friend  Positives:  + I'm all about the thin crust. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=qf12YBWeKcLe2leFp09fPA + The sauce has a nice kick to it. + The fresh mozzarella tasted good. In fact, everything was very fresh. + They give kids pizza dough to play with while waiting for the food - fun! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=9ZRm5qrrVJIQDnohj1llDA  Negatives:  - There was a 45 minute wait - the price of popularity. - The service had chain feel to it that didn't rub me the right way. "I'm (server's name), and I'm going to take care of you." It was friendly enough, but wasn't for me. - My friend's pizza didn't have enough basil, and she asked for more. Our server said she could bring more for $2. That was disappointing for a tiny dish of chopped basil, considering it was already a topping and our $75 bill.  Overall, I enjoyed the pizza and the kid-friendly atmosphere. It wasn't the best ever, but I'm a fan.

I never tasted "Paradise" until a recent visit to Arizona. They have some slogan about being known for their cookies. I felt like the gauntlet was thrown, so I took up the challenge.   I decided to get two chocolate chip cookies. The clerk working here was nice and gave me two for the price of one since it was near the end of the day. The cookies didn't look incredible, but looks can be deceiving. In this case, they weren't.  Mr. L and I waited until our Greyhound Bus ride to Tucson to try them. They were too sugary and did not taste good. We weren't interested in finishing them - not worth the calories nor the effort of chewing. Mr. L said Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Chip Cookies were better, not that Pepperidge Farm cookies are the pinnacle of greatness or bad either, but I expected better from a bakery that brags about their cookies.   The cookies were the perfect 2 star complement to sitting by the bathroom on the back of the Greyhound Bus.   Instead of finding paradise in the cookie form, it was more like "Paradise Lost."

We had some time to kill after a schedule change left us stranded at the Greyhound Station in Phoenix. We ditched the bus station and asked a cab driver to take us somewhere - anywhere - interesting. We ended up at Biltmore Fashion Center and were dropped off near Zinburger. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=bHZobMw7BzUv5Thd211_QQ  We saw many diners enjoying burgers, shakes, and fries, and asked Ichabod if he'd like something to eat. He seemed excited about the restaurant and chose barstools for us near the pleasant outdoor patio dining area.   We ordered:  * Roasted chicken salad with organic greens, pomegranate, marcona almonds, and goat cheese dressing  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=5lTby7rzAD3Japndi95ykg  * Burger of the day - angus and brie with truffled aioli. The flavor of the cheese overpowered the meat, but it was still tasty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=d0aoEc0hSLAppfbY3MNhtg  * Fries - limp, greasy, disappointing. How does a burger place mess up fries? They looked better than they tasted. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=mGD30C-GrVFNzmaCRU-9jA  * Black cow float - root beer float with a tall glass packed with vanilla ice cream. I wasn't sure how they could justify charging $6 for it, but the price made more sense when I saw the amount of high quality ice cream and the premium root beer. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=kSz0KDrt4SPLOaPr26CFSw  Mr. L and I shared the salad and burger, which they split for us, and brought in succession. That made dining easy and enjoyable.   Our server was borderline unpleasant and impatient, and gave me the impression she wanted us to order quickly and be done with us. When she gave us our check, she made one attempt at friendliness, the last-ditch "don't stiff me my tip endzone play," which we witnessed her do with another customer at the bar. Strange. In contrast, the other Zinburger servers were consistently pleasant and very helpful.   The bovine theme here is pervasive, from the cow decorations on the walls http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=ljBTfOt7fXWa15uq55A_lQ to the trough sink in the ladies room. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=_-qDTkIuzpxOMk1RgJ5z4w  From the burgerlicious food to the fun atmosphere, I can see why Zinburger is a popular eatery.

I expected to find great pizza when we visited New York, but Arizona? Ironically, we had better pizza in Arizona than in New York, thanks in large part to Taste of Italy Numero Dos. Our friends live two blocks away and are enthusiastic about this place. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?userid=fDny65qdxn3EJH0PZbCxIw  We got takeout:  * Half Caprese Pizza (Fresh Homemade Mozarella, Tomato Sauce, Fresh Garlic, Fresh Basil, Pecorino Romano & Freshly Sliced Tomatoes) - I didin't see tomatoes, but I didn't hold it against them. I think we may have gotten the Margherita instead. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=k6KdshrFJ1aX3_c36fHtpw * Half Cheese Pizza * Meat Lovers (Pepperoni, Meatball, Sausage, Ham, Bacon, Extra Cheese) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=ZS6DxijAx51SqPI-4ZY7qg * Salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=-zSvKvsXY6-Ih7KYhuGDNw  The fresh homemade mozzarella on the caprese (or margherita) was fantastic. That, the tangy sauce, and the fresh basil elevated the pizza to the elusive 5 star status. The crust was a little chewier than I prefer, but this is truly one of the best pizzas I've had (and yes, I've been to Italy).  The cheese pizza was delicious and well-balanced, adult and kid-friendly. Mr. L and our friends enjoyed the meat lovers special. The meat toppings were very generous. Our salad was fresh and tasty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=JLSU9y1uIHG-2QHJp-SbOQ  This is a family-run business and our friends say the chefs are from Italy. I didn't confirm if they are from Italy, but the pizza sure tastes the way I think it should. On our next visit to Goodyear, I will be happy to return.
