I have been going to glad nails for over 5 years now and usually had a ok- great pedi depending on the nail tec. Last month I received horrible service and pedi. It was done by one of the male tecs. He performed the wrong pedi and told me that I could not change to the sea salt one because he already put lotion on my leg. Then he put the wrong color on. No tip and never will be back. Just found a new nail salon on Happy Valley Rd.  They are awesome and use hot rocks in their pedi service.

Horrible!  No flavor, weak sushi, and menu prices do not match what they try to charge you .. They try to scam you on the price.. Beware!!!!

It was a very good massage. He started with the head, face and upper back. I opted for the 60 min massage. The only negatives were that his breath had an onion smell and that they had a smiley sign at the checkout counter to push you to make a bigger tip.  The girl at the counter actually pointed at it and asked me why "I'm not happy" because I gave a $7.00 tip. The massage is worth coming back for.

2nd time in a row of bad service.  Waited 45 mins for an egg white omelette while all the other meals were served. Finally received the omelette after we were done with our meals. Had to get a togo box for the omelette as we had plans in Sedona. Brought the bill with no discount or apology. Had to go up to the counter and request a discount. After a discussion the omelette was taken off the bill.

Tom is fantastic. He has an intimate knowledge of the market and always gave great insights. He has an extensive network that really helped in multiple situations. He is extremely responsive, pays attention to detail, and just overall very friendly and great to work with. I would give him 10 stars if that option was available.
