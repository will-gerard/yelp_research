Love this place! I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here! They serve quality gourmet food. And they have a full bar too. Place is clean and service is great. Would go back anytime!

Not really a fan of this place, decided to go because my friend and seen a 2 for 1 deal which was an entree and an appetizer or dessert for $10. So we thought why not. I had a house salad, and the chicken brushetta pasta. The chicken on the the pasta was not fresh tasted like cardboard. Will not be going back.

Love this place. My friends and i go here often for breakfast. The mardigras omelette is good as well as the eggs benedict. this place gets busy in themornings on Sunday so there will be a little bit of a wait sometimes. Overall good breakfast or brunch place, they also serve dinner as well.

The food here was ok because we were craving pho, however it is a rip off totally highly over priced for some pho.

This place is good for a late night meal and convenient however the first time we went our server had the worse customer service. He gave us attitude and all we asked was how much longer for our food. Acted like he hated life and did not want to be there. Someone must of been having a bad day. Horrible service!

This place is amazing! If you live gourmet and love meats this is the place to be. They have waiters who come around and serve you different types of meats from pork, chicken, filet mignon...its all u can eat! Including sides and salad bar. They also have this desert you can eat that breaks down the meats. Awesome place and totally worth it! Just be sure to come hungry!

Not too impressed with the food they didn't even have AC in there. Like how are you not going to have AC living in Az and eating Pho.

My friend and I decided to stop by and get something to eat after we got done shopping. I usually eat at the actual resturant instead of inside the mall. I ordered the garlic dip and a side of seasoned chicken, my friend ordered the chicken del sol. All these are my favorites everytime I dine at Pita. I don't know if its just because its located in the mall and they don't have everything that the actual menu does at the resturant. The seasoned chicken had way too much seasoning on it. The chicken del sol looked different and tasted way different, they did not put the chipotle sauce on the cheese pita.

Nice salon n trendy! I had a tanning package there and tanned there for a few months, got me pretty bronze! The good thing is the packages are affordable and there is no start up fees or cancelation fees. Everyone there is friendly.

This is the old club 6. Friday nights would be the best night to go I think. Mixed crowd and music is not too bad. Saturdays here are a total different atmosphere with not so much of variety types of music. Overall this is one of the places I would choose to go out at over most of the clubs in the area.

This is a great place to go and watch the games. The buffalo shrimp appetizer as well as the grilled shrimp entree are both great! My friend always gets the monte cristo sandwich which is amazing. On game days it wouold be best to get here early because this place gets super busy they got Tv's lined up everywhere that shows all the games which makes it more fun and exciting.

I recently did the body wrap here. It was a horrible experience for me. I will never do one again! No one informed me that I was going to get burnt. I got burnt on my theigh, abdominal, and hip. It took 3 days to fade away, and it developed a water blister on the left side of my hip. Today you can still see the burn a little bit. Im hoping it does not scar. I called to member services to complain and they were NOT helpful at all! The girl offered to credit me a free session, I was like are you kidding me why would I want to go through this again after being burnt and terrified from it. I couldn't even put clothes on because it hurt so bad. At the time when I was getting it done I even told the girl I felt it burning and she told me it was normal. I basically got a 1-2 degree burn from this experience and all protan had to say was its normal it takes a few hours to a day to go away! NOT! This will probably leave a scar on my skin. If anyone does the body wrap I would make sure to ask all the questions before doing it.
