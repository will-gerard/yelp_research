We took my mom in for her first outing after surgery today.  The chips were very good.  That is the LAST NICE thing I have to say.  The salsa was acceptable.  The hostess was very unfriendly and seemed confused.  Really poor attitude. She put us in a spot where my mom could not get through with her walker.  Our food took over 40 minutes to arrive.  Two meals took an additional five minutes to come out.  My mom's steak was well done, ordered med. rare. They took the steak and then seem surprised when five minutes later I asked them to take the plate away and bring out fresh fries, bread and veg WITH THE STEAK when it was finished! The waiter was perplexed as to why she might like her whole meal at the same time.    I finally told them to forget the steak dinner. We were leaving.  The manager came over and was completely clueless about how poor his staff was performing and how crappy the food was. He could have cared less.   He thinks schmoozing is going to make us forget the crap show they just put on?  Puleeze!!  That server should be spending his time in his station instead of hiding out in the kitchen until he HAS to come out.  That is a surefire way to fail to see what you need to see.  My fajitas tasted like the sizzling skillet they were on.  There was no other flavor there.  The side of beans and rice was a complete joke.  It was flavorless as well.  The cheese that came with the order seemed fake.   Don't sell Mexican food if you are going to fail to put any authentic flavors in.  I guess it serves me right for not going to a Mexican restaurant and just stick to fried appetizers at a place like this.  Really, really disappointing.  I will not be back!!!  The quality is missing from the food.  The quality is missing from the service.  The quality is missing from the management.

The former owner is back so I went in to give it another try. FANTASTIC!!  The crust is excellent.

The food here is fantastic. One piece of advice, get the "wrap" not the pita. The pita is good, but the homeade wrap is FANTASTIC! The service is good. The place is clean. The soda tastes of bad water, but I just get my food to go and drink a can of soda at home. It is not a good enough reason to take away a star. You are foolish not to run here at your earliest convenience and eat a large gyro wrap with all the fixin's and extra sauce.

UPDATE:   Soda now tastes delicious.  They must have put in a purifier.

The delivery is fast. The food is delicious. The wings need to be deep fried. DO NOT order wings without specifying that they be fried. Trust me. The owner is diligent about customer satisfaction.

I ordered lasagna, dinner salad and soup.  The Italian wedding soup tasted just like Italian dressing.  It used to be so good. I was so disappointed in it that I saved it for a week to get a refund since I only took two bites but never found the time to take it in and deal with the manager I spoke to that seemed hesitant to provide a refund vs. a replacement product. All the herby delicious flavor was gone and sweet, sweet, sweet took over. Don't they know not to mess with a good thing. Either they changed the recipe or they have a lazy cook.  The lasagna was good but also really sweet. The portion for the price was disappointing. For that much money, I will just make a pan at home and freeze some portions.    The dinner salad was fantastic. Full of yummy, crispy veggies. If the lettuce had been drained and the dressing didn't come out of a bottle with so much sugar it could gag you, I would get that salad twice a week.   I won't be returning for anything BUT the salad, and only if I have my own dressing.  Bummer update.

Eggroll had 1 tablespoon of filling. Unacceptable. They were a gross mouthful of uncooked wrapper. Incredibly bad.  The wings were dry but acceptable. Nothing to return for.  The Kung Pao chicken had chicken, stringy green onions, and a tablespoon of peanuts. No texture. No spice. Just sugary sauce and mush. Really bad. It used to have celery, water chestnuts, and carrots. It sorely misses that textural element.  The Kung Pao broccoli was the same as above without chicken. I requested extra spicy. I got a spice level appropriate for a young child.  Too sweet for me to even eat. It went in the garbage.  The egg drop soup was really good, but there was nothing in it but broth, egg white, and about a teaspoon of mushroom and water chestnut. It at least had good flavor.  I will NOT be returning.  I would not spend a penny in this broken down joint that made the decision to increase profits by cutting quality.   Go the extra block to Good China for the quality.  This place will be shuttered in no time.

Great food.  Good service.  Some of the younger employees aren't as friendly, but they try.  The food is affordable, tasty, and delivery is fast.  They are consistently good.

The service here is great.  It takes a good 1/2 hour to 45 minutes to pick up the car so plan accordingly.  If they are really busy, it could be even longer.  They take their time to go over the car and insurance options with you, which I appreciate.  Drop off is a lot faster.  10 minutes max.   They have never been pushy or picky with me.  Super easy process and very nice cars in my experience.  I will use them again.

What a terrible little operation going on here. The name of the game: Nickel and dime you until you cannot see straight. Why can't they just operate on the up and up? If you cannot compete legitimately, it's time to change your business model.  They show you all the fees and expenses on a tiny little screen. They told me $19.99 for insurance per day that includes roadside assistance. Turns out, not so much. The roadside was another $6 per day. When I needed assistance, they told me to take it to tire shop and have it checked...ON MY VACATION??? Ridiculous. Also, I paid for an intermediate car, Dodge Charger, etc. They offered me a KIA Sol. Do I want to ride around in a toaster? Do I want to be responsible for a Kia tin can? NO! Kia and Hyundai should NOT be included in upper level cars!!  I WILL NEVER, EVER use this place again. It is 95% scam and 5% legitimate. You will pay three times what you would pay elsewhere. ALSO, DO NOT RENT at the PHX airport. The 56% surcharge can be avoided at off site locations.  ** update:  I was offered a refund on the roadside assistance fees.

If the service were as good as the food, they would have gotten four stars.    First, the chef cannot make ANYTHING spicy.  I don't know if he doesn't know how or he just doesn't care to, but he just cannot make a "chefs hot" dish to match a real Indian chef. He sends out chili powder to the table if you want a dish hotter.  Really lazy and doesn't care is how it seems to me.   We have tried three different times to get a spicy dish. A baby could eat this food. NO heat at all.  The servers are extremely slow.  They have no sense of urgency.  They mostly stand with their elbows on the counter staring out at the dining room. Also, check your check total. They almost always get it wrong -- in their favor by a few bucks. If you come in off peak, they are NOT happy to see you. They will let you know that you have a limited time to eat and they are closing the doors. That is a terrible business practice.   For the taste of the food, you think this place would be packed. The Groupon will pull you in but the service will send you running.  It is a real shame what the servers do to the reputation of what could be a fine restaurant, but it is management's fault for not keeping an eye on the servers.

A few of us went in for lunch today.  The place was packed, but the food and service were both fantastic!!  I had the salad bar and my guests had sandwiches.  Everything tasted fresh. We got our sandwiches within five minutes.  The manager stopped by our table twice to check on us.  Another employee came by to see if we needed anything. The service was impressive to say the least.

First time visit.    Service was terrible. We had a trainee that was entirely too inexperienced to be left alone with customers. We waited 15 minutes from the time we got our drinks to order food.  He would set the food on the table with NO comment. No utterance. Who does the hiring here? You might want to hire people with personalities.  The food was just okay.  Is there any management presence in this place?  Are they tasting the food? Are they requiring any kind of standards in service, food temp, and overall experience at all? I did not see any sign that anyone was showing leadership in this place.  It seemed so promising. They are sorely in need of a detail-oriented leader.   I would not return her for anything other than drinks.

What a disappointing experience. I went in on 10/8/2012 for a late lunch. The crew is so disappointed to see anyone outside of rush hour. It is the most unwelcoming feeling. I could not sit down because of the filthy seat. My husband had to find something to wipe down my booth seat before I could sit down. The busser didn't even seem to notice that there was dirty seats at every table he cleaned. The floor under one table was absolutely filthy. No one blinked an eye. The manager stood and stared out to the floor. He was far enough away to not see anything. Bad strategy. The server completely abandoned us after our food came. She brought me a ketchup with nothing in it and then proceeded to stand at another table and talk for five minutes. My husband had to go get some pico and tabasco for us. We finally interrupted her to get another bottle of ketchup.  I did not like my meal at all. It fell apart. It was dry. They put about a 1/4 teaspoon of hummus on it. It was a black bean burger that desperately needed salt. I had no opportunity to ask for anything to improve it because the server failed to check on us for eternity. My hubby loved his hummus and chicken dish and the caramelized cauliflower/tahini dish was out of this world delicious. That got them an additional star.  This store has completely neglected the details. Their standards have taken a serious dive. I will not be going back until they have new management in place. Cleanliness, and customer service are seriously deficient.

So we popped back into the Yard House after the Mexico/USA soccer match. Guess what?  My husband's food was stone cold, AGAIN. If you cannot produce a fish taco at an appropriate temperature, stop serving them. I am so done with this place. Of course the waitress took the plate and commented on the "stone cold" nature of the dish, but by the time a new one came, everyone was finished with their meal.  Also, the dish of beans served with the fish taco was about 10 beans in a cup of liquid. Someone does not care what they serve and no manager is catching on and fixing this stuff before the food hits the table.    At this point, I have to assume that this is not going to change. I am not returning here.

We went to Baci to celebrate with family.  They were extremely accommodating.  The food was good.   Minor issues: I do think that the server should be less concerned with us keeping our silverware after the salad course. Just go get some clean forks and hand them out.  Also the Fox news playing on every TV is just disconcerting when you are trying to enjoy a night out.  Propaganda and pasta just don't mix.    Otherwise, fantastic.  I would recommend to everyone!!

This place does a great job with vegan food. My ONLY issue is the large amount of sugar they use in many of their recipes. I would eat there regularly if the all the sauces and dressings were not loaded with all that sugar.

Here is the straight dope on Carolina's/Peoria:  If you are looking for super friendly service, keep looking. The service is inconsistent.  If you are looking for fast and competent, you will find it here most of the time.    If you are looking for a perfect order every time, keep walking.  If you take the time to thoroughly check your order, you will be satisfied, but you cannot be afraid to speak up. Sometimes they undercook the tacos which makes them seem stale.  The salsa is improved.  The chips are good. The beans and rice are yummy.   When it is super busy, you will not like most anything about it, but it is super busy because it is good food, so what do you want?  Also, they keep the AC on about 85 so be ready to sweat.   Now, the cleanliness issue.  There is an issue with cleanliness in the front of the house.  The back of the house seems to be kept much cleaner. For this reason, I get my food to go. I do NOT order beverages. The machines seem very unkempt and not maintained. I get the heeby jeebies just thinking about the bacteria in the ice maker and drink machines.    So that's my two cents.

Do you want to pay $500 for your cat to get three shots? This is the place for you!! They will try to hook you into follow-up treatment because they just cannot get enough cash out of you in just one appointment. Is it odd that a shot costs $100? Not here. That's just run of the mill regular.   This place makes me understand why people just let their animals suffer until the last moment. They are no friend to animals. They are a capitalistic racket with profit as their only motive. RUN far away to a mom and pop shop where the vet and staff is not worried about padding their bill and reaching their sales goals.  BTW, when you explain to them that the cost is prohibitive, they kindly offer payment plans and credit cards. They think that is equal to finding a treatment plan that is affordable and ABSOLUTELY necessary. Oh, and the $175 in-house blood test is a complete RIPOFF!!   I do not recommend!

The service and food here are excellent!!  The manager has put together a team that impressed me so much, I called him and told him so.  The guys that work there -- and I say "guys' because most of my interactions have been with male employees -- take a genuine interest in making sure you have a good experience.  They are attentive and friendly.  It took a few minutes to get the sandwich, but we didn't care because the time was spent well putting together a delicious product.  Not to mention, Richard, the associate that helped us, was chatting it up and asking us about our day as he worked. Nothing felt forced or "mandatory."  He is a genuinely nice guy.  The manager told me that their corporate headquarters rely heavily on the surveys on receipts for giving the employees their bonuses, etc.  If everyone on Yelp could remember to do one on occasion, it is greatly appreciated by the staff there, I'm sure.

What a letdown!!  The redhead behind the counter....SLOW!!  there was no sense of urgency from most of the employees.  One guy was hustling.  Everyone else..snoozing.    The place was boiling hot and humid.  Probably about 85 degrees. You want to make a line full of people angry, keep it hot.  Our order got pushed behind a jerk customer's order. Squeaky wheel and all. Really unfair.   I was so impressed with this place before.  They were completely ridiculous this visit.  I will not be going back anytime soon.  The food was delish, but it is not so good that I would put up with the lax service.  Management MUST have changed.

Just got back from Kiku Sushi...YUMM!! How much fun is a revolving sushi buffet? We loved it.   We ate until we were stuffed along with two giant beers for $40. The sushi was fantastic. The egg roll was cold, but I just told them and they took it right away. The cucumber salad was cold, tasty, and a great palette cleanser. Our waitress, JoJo was eager to get us to try her favorites and you can tell she is proud of the food they serve. The whole staff greeted everyone as they entered. Really great vibe, reasonable prices, delicious food revolving around the room, and cold beer....this is my idea of a good time!!

Sad update. We returned to Kiku Sushi the next day for lunch. They had tons and I mean  a lot of food revolving around, but there were no customers to eat it. The egg rolls and gayoza were stone cold, but there is a sign stating they will heat it up. They took the deep fried combo and dropped it in the fryer again. Kind of grossed me out. Who knows how long any of that food had been on that revolving belt. The cucumber salad was kind of wilted and had to be at least an hour old.   It seems that they need a better system when demand is slow. Also, there is one server that just stands and stares at us pretty much the entire time we are eating. It is very uncomfortable. I overlooked it the first time because I thought she might just be tired or something, but she had the same dumb expression this time for an hour and just watched us while wiping lids. The server disappeared for very long periods of time, I'm talking 10 minutes with no sightings. This was the same server from the night before. The few times she came out, she had her cellphone in hand. The rest of the staff was nice, and the chef came over and explained some speciality rolls to us then offered to make some fresh for us to taste. That was yummy and served at an appropriate temp.  I really hope the owner or mgmt. figures out a system to keep old food off the belt. I cannot return until they do. I just think that it should be an obvious issue, and if it isn't, what are they serving me the rest of the time. The standards must be raised before I return. My love affair with Kiku Sushi is on hold until they up their standards.

Their wasabi had no flavor. The manager/owner could have cared less. She was ONLY concerned with a table of Japanese patrons. She ignored our concerns completely. We will not return.

First time to Buffalo Wild Wings. This is how you do SERVICE! Not only was the food delicious, but the To-Go service was fantastic. The gal working the counter went 10 steps beyond to make us happy. I just called and told the manager what a great job everyone did. I love good service!  The wings were super yummy. I think I will order them "wet" next time because the sauce is so good, but other than that, perfection. We will be back!

It would be nice if they told you about Happy Hour when you come in during those hours. It would be nice if the manager did ANYTHING besides sit behind the register staring at nothing. It would be nice if the food came out in under 20 minutes WITHOUT a hair on it. It would be nice if they seasoned the food a bit. $50 for a below average sushi experience....no thanks. No recommendation from me!

This is the best theater in town! Once you go here, you never want to go anywhere else. We tried to watch a movie at Harkins last week, and it felt so ghetto.  I really like the reserved seating, the leather seats, the soda machines, and the service is always good.    We are spoiled rotten by this movie experience!

Food is amazing.  Service in the bar is just awful.  I sat in the bar and the male bartender was absolutely inexperienced and obviously untrained.  I have two decades of experience in hospitality, and I am contracted with one of the top service evaluation firms in the world.  This experience deserved a special posting.  We were finished with our appetizers before he even took our drink order.  He could only do one thing at a time and seemed to think that giving away alcohol was the key to service.  He gave away more alcohol than he sold.  I wouldn't expect this place to be around long with the kind of giveaways going on here.  How can a restaurant owner sink that much money into a place and not have a hawk eye on the comps in the bar.  I think it's likely illegal to give away booze.  At least it used to be in AZ.   A good bartender or manager will try multiple ways to manage expectations and improve guest experience before giving away the store.  The inability of this bartender to show a sense of urgency or utilize any system of service steps indicates that this place will either learn the lessons the hard way or smarten up and bring in experience quickly before this untrained, unsuccessful method spreads to the rest of the staff and causes the hard-to-get-rid-of service rot and mindset that has been the enemy of startups for decades.   Get competent staff trained in the bar and I will definitely return with friends and family.
