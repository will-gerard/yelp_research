Very delicious little sandwich shop. They do not have very much variety but what they do offer is made with fresh local ingredients. Portions are small so it's better for a quick lunch, but definitely worth a try. Their balsamic is really good and they import it from Italy... I asked to purchase some but the denied me. Jerks! Haha just kidding

This place is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix! I love the cute quaint atmosphere and their delicious food! Their tantan-men Ramen is the best! It's a little bit spicy, but not overpowering at all. I've also tried their tempura, gyoza, and sushi and it's all been delicious.

Well, I really wanted to love this place, but that was not the case. I had seen this restaurant featured on 'Check Please Arizona' and because it is within close proximity to my house, I thought I would give it a try. First, the appetizer platter was not great.  The hummus was below average, the tzatziki was ok, the babaganoush was not good at all, and the pureed pink caviar was too awful to stomach.  The platter was over priced and the amount of food was small.  Next, I ordered the shrimp saganaki, which was pretty good, but again, small and over priced ($14 for an appetizer of 5 shrimp). The pita bread was actually very good, however. My companion got a salad with smoked salmon and she didn't enjoy it at all and told the server she didn't like it and he said well that was the description on the menu... and did not offer her anything else or take the uneaten salad off the bill. Our drinks ran dry and the service was terrible.  I will not be back. Across the street is a place called cyprus grill, it is a lot better than this place.

There were a few things that were missing from this store but he selection was nice. I enjoyed the bakery as well. The egg tarts leave much to be desired but the cream cheese bread was scrumptious! I also bought a few things I haven't seen before so I am excited to try them!

Cibo is phenomenal! You must try the burrata appetizer it is deliciously creamy and  is served with prosciutto and toast points. The best time to visit is when the weather cools down and you can sit outside and enjoy live music (on the weekends only I think).

I really enjoyed this restaurant! We went here for a group dinner and it was a bit loud and hard to hear everyone at the table, but the food was amazing! I thought the brisket was one of the best I've ever had, if not THE best. It was so juicy and tender and very flavorful. Also, the baby back ribs were also to die for. They give you corn bread to start that is super delicious and end with FRESH mini donuts that were just fried. I can't wait to go back!

This is one of those places that you pass a million times and tell yourself you should go in, but never do. Well you should! I am amazed at how delicious their baked goods are. I really wasn't expecting that much because the exterior of the building looks a bit run down. But oh man, their pastries are soft and pillowy and delicious! I tried a few and they just kept getting better and better! Yum!

Best burgers in the valley! Freshly ground beef, soft fresh bun, and great toppings! This is the best place to go for a burger. (Disclaimer: I haven't tried any other food there)

This place is awful. Their lettuce for the salads is old and brown and their sandwiches taste stale. There are so many other options in the area. Any of them are better than this place.

I can see how people would like this little food truck/hot dog stand. Lots of topping choices and Mexican cokes definitely add to the appeal. I just thought it was ok. The quality and taste of the hot dogs themselves was not good. I did appreciate the unique toppings but the hot dogs were gross. They should use Nathan's or Hebrew national!

America's is one of my favorite taco shops and I frequent this place for lunch and dinner. Their carne asada and al pastor tacos are a must. They season everything perfectly and cut their meat in very small pieces which I like. I also enjoy their carne asada quesadillas because the cheese they use is a really delicious white cheese. I always order the street corn and ask for it off the cob which is never a problem. So good! I take all my visitors here!!!

This restaurant definitely has a lot of character. There are strings of Christmas lights and plenty of flashy decor on the walls, but the best part about this place is the food! We started with the tofu appetizer and it was served lightly fried and extremely hot. We ordered a side of peanut sauce, but as it turned out the chili sauce that accompanied the tofu was actually better. I ordered the green curry with beef and was very satisfied with it. I like a medium amount of spice, but I asked for mild because Thai food tends to be 10x spicier than any other type of food. I'm glad I did because the mild was plenty spicy enough. I wasn't fond of the beef in the curry dish, next time I'll opt for vegetarian or tofu instead. My guest is a picky eater and she ordered the pineapple friend rice with cashews and seemed to like it as well. I'm pretty sure it was mixed with a yellow curry powder, so beware picky eaters! All in all very good Thai food and I'd definitely return and recommend this place. The food was piping hot and served fresh from the kitchen!

Very delicious and fresh! The noodles are hand made (obviously), they have a nice texture and bite to them. We had the salt and pepper fish appetizer and that was extremely good as well. We tried the steamed dumplings and they were just ok... Too much dough and the beef inside was a bit tough. We really enjoyed the noodle dishes, though. The pan fried noodles with veggies are the best!

This place is definitely a must try! I was craving some posole and this place hit the spot. We also try $1 tacos during happy hour and a beef tamale, all were delicious! I wish they opened earlier, though. They have a breakfast menu but don't open until 9.

My absolutely favorite dishes at rice paper are the firecracker shrimp and the garlic noodles. You must must must order these two things when you go there!!! The rest of the food is just ok and the pho is not the best I've had or even close to it, but these shrimp and noodles are to die for. Seriously, eat them and thank me for it later. You're welcome.

Green is one of my favorite restaurants! I frequent this joint often because the food is fast and delicious. I am certainly not a vegan or a vegetarian but I do enjoy their food. My favorites here are the wings and the big wac.  The wings are an amazing texture and come with cucumber ranch that is very good. The big wac is messy but it taste very similar to the Big Mac without the guilt. I love their sweet potato tots and their French Fries as well. If you've never tried their vegan cookies or the soynamis at 'Nami' you must give them a try too. Everything is very reasonably priced and the atmosphere is very relaxed. I love taking out of towners here too!

I've seen this place a hundred times and never gave it much thought until I saw the Yelp! Reviews had been pretty consistent. It's very close to my house and has convenient parking. I'm usually up for trying new things but I was in the mood for Tikka masala so I went with that and it came with a piece of naan and i ordered a side of rice. A good solid 3.5 stars but I was generous and rounded up. The restaurant itself has zero ambiance and the strip mall where it's located is pretty run down, but the food was pretty good. The chicken was all white meat and cooked well. The sauce had a bit of a kick even though I ordered the 'mild' which was actually a perfect amount for me. The food was all hot and fresh quickly made. I'd definitely try it again.

l love this place, although this location may not be as good as the original one downtown it still hits the spot. The carne asada is delicious and I love their quesadillas. Their chips leave much to be desired but everything else is on point in my opinion. Their corn- off the cob- is amazing!

I found this sushi bar on Yelp and wanted to give it a try. We ordered a spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, a sex and the city roll, and tamago. All were very fresh and delicious. I saw online that they had a grab and go station, but when I visited, it was empty so I sat and wait for my to-go order. No big deal, it was only a short wait and I had enough change in the meter. Parking wasn't bad, but I can imagine that during prime times it could be a bit of a challenge to find a spot. Make sure to bring some change for the meter! Definitely recommend this place. The only small downfall for me was that the sushi rice was a bit sweeter than I am used to. Still good, but I do like the regular rice better. The fish was all fantastic! Next time I will try some appetizers.

I really wanted to like this place. It's a cute little spot, with some healthy food options and a small menu. I was pretty disappointed for several reasons.  First and most importantly, the food just wasn't as good as I had expected. We ordered a fish sandwich and a burger and split them. We also tried the chips and lebni appetizer. The hot sauce/ salsa served with the chips was awesome, way better than the lebni. I didn't enjoy the lebni at all, it was so lemony, but maybe that's what lebni is supposed to taste like? I'm not sure. The burger wasn't good at all. While it was juicy, it didn't taste seasoned. It tastes like plain hamburger meat which wasn't appetizing to me at all. The bun was delicious, which was a nice surprise. It was soft and fluffy with poppy seeds on top. The fish sandwich had a large batter coating with little fish. The fish that was there was pretty strong. It didn't taste fresh. On top of it all there were flies buzzing around inside landing on us and our food which was super annoying. The manager saw us batting at the flies and didn't try to take care of them. The service wasn't great either, we had to ask for everything: napkins, refills, check, etc. however they were friendly, just not attentive.

I loved the cheesesteak gyro with sautéed onions, peppers and mushrooms! The side salad was packed with feta and it was fresh and delicious as well. Definitely a must try if you're in the neighborhood.

This dinner was so incredibly messy it was annoying. The crab legs were good, but I will not come back here again. I felt like this is a place where you go if you dont mind your hands and face dripping in butter while you eat. I also really despise places that give you plastic forks and paper cups when you are eating at a sit down restaurant.

The restaurant is small, in a strip center, in a questionable area, but the banh mi's were very good. I ordered the #2 with pork, an egg, and pate. The egg was a bit more cooked than I would have liked but the sandwich was pretty good and very affordable. I didn't, however, like the smell of the restaurant and the lotus salad was just ok for me. I didn't love the taste of fish sauce in the salad but some people may like that. The guy who took our order was very nice. 4 stars because I'd go back but I still think da vang has better banh mi's.

I really wanted to love this place! I saw the reviews online and found that they had grits on their menu, (I am a connoisseur of grits). Whenever I see a place has grits that's automatically what I order. That being said, they were definitely disappointing. The grits tasted like they had thyme or some other kind of spice that turned me off to this dish and my eggs were over cooked. I also ordered the biscuit with sausage and brisket, but that too was not very good. Maybe because I just had some awesome brisket at Bobby Q's the night before, but this brisket was sub par by far. The pro's: the biscuit was delicious, it tasted fresh and was soft and buttery. The side of toast we ordered was also delicious. The bacon on the sand which was thick and cooked perfectly. It's an adorable little spot with a great patio and a small off street parking lot. The staff was very friendly and even offered us a free fruit infused water.
