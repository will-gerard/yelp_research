A friend and I went to AMC dine in theater, I had the burger which was good she had the macaroni and cheese which was cold so she sent it back.  We both shared the macaroni and cheese which was returned to us luke warm.   Within four hours she was violently ill shortly after I experience the same symptoms, we were both severely ill for the next two days, i'm guessing Norwalk virus.  I contacted the Maricopa County health department, I will no longer eat at this establishment.

I didn't give it five stars because there is a slight chance there maybe better pizza out there, but I doubt it.

First time to the mellow mushroom, was very excited. Took over an hour to get the pizza, waitressed blamed the amount of people in the restaurant and how busy they were restaurant was, maybe 20% occupancy. Service was absolutely awful. Pizza was okay but the service really killed it.

This location is poorly run, staff is untrained on computer system and service.  There is no communication among the management who scramble to put out fires.  This location should be closed while kitchen, front, and management are retrained. The bread is terrific.

After leaving a review voicing my concerns, I was quickly contacted by the CEO of wildflower bread Company,  he was very concerned about my experience and wanted further details to ensure the problem was taken care of.  This is the type of company and company philosophy that garners my support.
