I split an order with my mom and the entire order was wrong. The order was fixed but then the waitress didn't even bother to discount our bill. This was a dinner for my bachelorette party and I sat at the table waiting for my order to be corrected while my friends and family were able to enjoy their food. I can't say that I'll be back. Truly disappointed.

I've been going to Mary for over a year now and she never disappoints. She takes her time to get the job done right and pays attention to detail. She is personable and funny. I've suggested her to several of my friends (and my husband!) and have made appointments for my sisters when they are in town. I definitely plan to continue being a loyal customer! Thanks Mary!!! :)
