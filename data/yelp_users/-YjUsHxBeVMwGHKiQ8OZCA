I'm a green chili junkie, and this place has the best I've had in at least 10 years. The green beef burro, enchilada style with more green on top is worth the visit, You had better be hungry! It's less than $8, so a bargain as well.

This has to be one of the best Mexican food restaurants in the valley. I will now go out of my way to visit this place every chance I get. This is tradition real Mexican food, not the Americanized versions you get in most place. Bring your appetite because the portions are big.

I have heard about this place for several years from a friend, but never tried it until today. Don't make the same mistake I did. Go here next time you want a REAL sandwich. REAL MEAT, not some roll of pressed stuff. My FRESH TURKEY SUB was great. The bread was good, and not to doughy. The pepper relish gave it a great zing. The prices are very fair for a sandwich made with real meat. This is now regular fast food sub shop sandwich.  I am looking forward to trying several things on the menu here. The THANKSGIVING Bobbi looks good.  I'll be back...  My old favorite at AZ Sandwich company, who have been screwing up my orders lately, may not see me for a while.

I bought a set of tire from discount about 14 months ago for my wife's '99 SL500. When I went in this week for their rotation they told me they could not rotate the tire because the front tires were worn off on both sides below the wear points. This was due to the fact that they set the air pressures to low in those tire. They only had 14lbs of pressure in them, and they should have been at 30lbs. The tires were rates for 60K miles, but they only had about 10k on them. The new set they put on the rear had 24lbs in them, and they looked fine,  but they should have been at 35lbs. Discount would not stand behind their failed work.   They are the ones who set those pressures wrong, but I could not prove that fact. They tried to say the chrome on my rims was delaminating inside, and that was causing them to lose pressure. That was total BS, because both front and back tires had matching pressures on either side.  I'll be finding a new tire store next time after this.

This place severs real deal Mexican food.  I've lived in Chandler for 30 years, and I tried this place for the first time today. I can only kick myself for not going sooner. I LOVE good green chili, and these guys do it right. The best part is you can get either pork of beef. I had the beef today for lunch and it was great! Can't wait to take our friends and family here.   The chips are served with not one sauce, but 4. Sour cream, beans, as well as, red and green sauce. The dinners even comes with a free sopapilla, and who doesn't love a good warm sopapilla?

These guys are one of the very few places that offer hot green chili, and they don't use jalape√±os to make it hot like lots of places do. If you're a chili head then you'll love the food here. The other nice thing is the sopapilla after the meal. Who doesn't like sopapillas? The best part was lunch for 2 was only $15.

I have been going to this place for many years.  If you like to cook and you have never been, then you need to plan a couple hours for the first visit. There is SO MUCH to see and try here. It is a great cultural experience. They have food from all over the world.   You can't find a bigger fish selection anyplace. Make sure you tell them you want your fish cleaned, unless you like to use the guts. Also they will fry your fish in peanut oil for free. Try it you'll like it!   The produce is fresh, and there are many items you most likely have never seen before. The prices are good.   If your looking for oriental healing items they have a counter up front with many items.    They have opened one on the west side, and Tucson as well.

If you are a fan of real crane asada, then this is the place for you. This is one of the very few places in the state that uses the correct seasoning in their carne asada. The meat is always cooked correctly, and not overcooked like most places.

This company is out of control. They charge to much for very poor service. They have little customer service. The speeds for their internet are not as advertised. I'm cutting the cable completely. I shut off TV services a couple of years ago, and now the internet is going. I get better service from my cellular service. Screw cox!

I had not been in here for a year or two. I had forgot just how good their meatball subs are. The sauce they use is the best of any in town I've had.  I usually get my meatball subs at Oregano's or AZSandwichCo , which are good, but the sauce here is MUCH better!     I just wish there was one in Chandler. Maybe they need to expand, since you still can't get into the place at lunch time, unless you've got lots of time on your hands.

This is the best pool shop in the east valley.  The have a great staff that will help solve any problems. They sell the better quality products at good prices.  I've been going here for 15 years, and they have always taken care of me. Most of my neighbors now go there as well.

About once per year I'll get suckered into going back to Arby's to try something out because they have a coupon. Today I went in to try out their chicken sandwiches. Since it was a two for $5 deal I tried two different sandwiches. The Chicken bacon swiss, and the Cordon blue. Both were very bland, except for the nasty metallic taste in the chicken. Even the bacon was horrible, and that's hard to do. It was way over microwaved I think.   I think this was my last visit to Darby's for good this time, since the last 3 visits have all been horrible!

I went here for the first time at lunch today. I have to say the #54 Spicy Chicken, with stir fry veggies had the best flavor!  I added a little extra garlic-chili sauce because I love that stuff, and I like it hot. It was so good I almost went back to get some more to take home for dinner, but I had an hour and a half drive home, so I didn't want to risk it. This is my new lunch spot when I'm in Glendale. I may even come back this weekend with my wife, even though it's 35 miles from my house.    Next time I want some of their noodles. I saw some on another table, and it looked excellent.

Took my oldest friend here  today for lunch, and got him hooked. He's lucky since he just lives about 2 blocks from this place. He had 2 pork chops shrimp with an over easy egg, a salad, and a side of veggies. I had the #64 beef and shrimp with veggies in a brown sauce. It was delicious, and just the right size for lunch. My friend took home a nice snack for later. This place will is worth the time for lunch, but get there early because it's small, and it fills up fast.

This has been our go to place for birthdays, and events for several years. It has always been a great experience. This is one of the few higher priced restaurants that IS worth the money. They do great specials all the time. Love the $5 happy hour  menu. Try them all. There is something for everyone.  LOTS of wine selections. Do not expect HEAPING plates. The portions are smaller, but I have never left even a little hungry.   I love the Poke salad. They made the best BBQ ribs I have ever had anyplace. I did actually lick the plate because it was SO good. The sushi rolls are good sized. The pulled pork is tangy, but not to sweet. All of the fish is wonderful. You will want to came back and try it all.    This is a must try place if you want to impress a date.

I can't say enough about how much I hate this store. I want the old Fry's back that used to be just a GOOD grocery store. This attempt to play mini-Walmart is the worst idea they could try. Stop trying to be a one size fits all store, and just do a good job with food. That IS way people go to grocery stores, NOT TO BUY FURNITURE.

If I could give a negative 5 star review I would. I got a $100 gift card for X-mas, and I have now been to this store twice trying to use the card. Both time they had NONE of the good sale items advertised in the web site. Today I went with 3 different items in mind that I saw as better deals on their web site, and they had NONE OF THEM! I asked if the had any of their new King Cuts they promote on their web site. They had NONE, of their supposed BEST STEAKS. What's the point of having a store that does not have ANY of their best deals?   I've gotten gift cards for this place for several years, and not ONCE have I gotten ANYTHING that was worth the money they ask, even on their BEST SALES. Are there really that many STUPID IGNORANT IDIOTS in the world? How do these people stay in business?   This has to be the WORST business model in existence.

Well the last two times we wanted a pizza delivered we went to Papa John's, and they have both times been very fast to deliver what I would call a good pizza. The toppings are good quality, and the hand tossed crust is good. I wish the sauce had a little more tang, and a little less sweet, but it's decent. My wife love the thin crust, and she has been happy with both pizzas. The Chicken Cordon Bleu she had today was excellent.   We even tried out the double chocolate brownies tonight, and they we hot and fresh, with plenty of chocolate.

I have eaten the wings here a few times, and they are big and meaty. I have to take them home and add some extra heat for my taste. This week I decided to try the Pizza. It tasted good down, but about 2 hours after eating 2 slices of the carnivore pizza I got the chills, and body aches. I didn't associate it with the pizza, until the 2nd day when I had 2 more pieces, and again 2 hours later I was sick. My wife had the popeye and said she never wants it again after the first night due to the horrible gas she got from it. The rest went to the trash.

I am sorry to say I was not impressed at all with this place. I had the Italian Stallion Pizza on the recommendation of a friend. It was the only pizza on the menu that had meat on it. I almost couldn't eat the pizza because it was SO SALTY! Now don't get me wrong, I LIKE salt, but this was WAY over the top. The crust was soft in the middle because you could not pick up a slice. It was not due to an excessive amounts of toppings at all. We had 3 different pizzas in our group, and we all had the same issue with the soggy centers. The staff did not impress me either. It was not that busy, but the service seemed slow. I guess you could call the atmosphere there shabby chic, leaning on shabby.   I had several people all say this place was good,  but I'ld take a FiredPie, or a Mod Pizza over this anyday! Not only are they much cheaper,  but there MUCH better!

Went back to this place today for lunch, and it was packed. I don't get it. It took an hour and a half to get lunch. There were 3 people total. We ordered 1 street tacos that takes less than 2 minutes, and 2 lunch special RibEye Rollup French Dips.   I had the $14.50 Rollup that was way overcooked and tiny for $14.50.   We sat by the kitchen. We had to watch our friend from out of town who took us there, watch his taco order get cold.  Thankfully since we knew they had sat there for 15 minutes at least, so they made new ones in about 2 mintues.    The wait staff was slow, and did not listen. I ordered an Arnold Palmer with mostly tea, and I got a glass of mostly lemonade.    Sorry that was their 3rd strike for me.   In this area if you want a GOOD Beef sandwich go to Oregano's. They have a Salad version that's great as well.

This was my 3rd visit to this place, and again I was very disappointed with the food and drink. I ordered Ice Tea as we were seated, and found the only ice tea they have is a fruit tea, which tasted like dirty dishwater. If you are going to serve ice tea, then make it normal tea. If you want to do fruity flavors that's cool, but who's the idiot the decided they would only serve fruity tea? They make several kinds of beer on site, so why can't they make 2 kinds of tea?   I was not real hungry, and was feeling under the weather a bit, so I decided some spicy chicken wing may help clear my nasal passages some. I ordered what they called hot wings. The chef here must think the mild sauce at taco bell is super hot, because the wings I got had almost no sauce, and absolutely no heat. I will give them credit that they were good sized wings, and they were cooked very nicely. They sell the wings by the pound, which ended up being 10 wings, at $9.50. If the wings had at least be good, then I maybe I would not have come here to let people know about these issues.   This was my last trip here. Next time some suggests this place I'll say no. I don't understand the high ratings for this place. Their beer is not that good either, so what is it people like about this place? I just don't get it.

This store is for rich stupid lazy people. The prices are insane on most things. They don't even do a good job of putting prices on items, or even on the bins they are in. I went in there today because they were the only vendor listed in the area for seavegi mix, which is a 1 oz bag of dried seaweed. they wanted $7.49 for the 1oz bag, which is crazy.   Since I was looking for Sushi stuff, I also looked at their fresh fish, and some of it was decent but expensive. The fresh tuna was grey, and $14.99/lb. I also looked at their pre-made Sushi, which I am not a fan of,  and it was again insanely priced.  They want $6.49 for 8 small pieces of rice and avocado, with no fish. None of what they had even looked good, and all of it was small pieces.   I also wandered past their grill. I must admit it did smell good, but for what they charge it had better be more than just average. The big cook of the day was Turkey, and they wanted $5.99/lb for turkey legs, and $4.49 for wings, which are mostly bones.    I'm sorry, but if your are dumb enough to shop in this store, then it proves you have more money than brains. Go to Sprouts. Save some money, and get better food.

This is the second try for this place, and while I will give them credit that the taste is good, but the prices make it not a good value. The pictures are deceiving, since the rolls are very skinny. $12 for a sandwich is just to much, unless it's huge.  That may play in NY where everything is expensive, but not here in Arizona. I'm still looking for a good value Cheesesteak, and a good value Italian Beef. The loss of Lobby's in Tempe still hurts.

I was hoping for another good place to get Gyro's in Chandler, and after reading all the reviews I thought this sounded like a good place. I just went in for lunch today to give them a try. After reviewing their menu I found they offer Italian beef sandwiches as well, and that is one of my favorite things. So instead of the Gyro I ordered the Italian beef Chicago style, which means dipped in the juices and with peppers. When I got home and opened the sandwich I was VERY disappointed to find a small dry sandwich with no peppers, and very little meat. The meat was dry and had very little flavor. They forgot the peppers, and the did not dip the sandwich. Even if they had made it correctly it still would not have been good.   If you want good Italian beef go to Lobby's in Tempe. They know how to make a real Italian beef sandwich! this may not have been the specialty of this store, but based on this experience I will never return.

This is not quite 5 star, but it IS a solid 4 star most of the time. They built a newer store on Chandler Blvd that is closer to my house, but I have started going back to this location because they seem to make better food. Their salsa bar is not as good though, they do not have as many things in the salsa bar.   I love the extreme Fajita burro if I'm real hungry, and the Green chili pork is pretty good as well. The Carna Asada is usually a little over cooked for my liking, but many people like it. Their Chicken Chimi is worth a try.

I stopped here tonight because my favorite sub place just over the freeway, AZ Sandwich Co, was out of bread. Never again. This place cost almost twice as much, and had about 1/3 of the meat. The bread was chewy, and the toppings didn't look very fresh.

David was the only one to personally respond to my 4 request for a quote, and inspection. The others only sent emails. David showed up and did a complete walkthrough inspection. He spent the time to explain the treatment, and the various pricing offers. His prices were very fair, and his service did what they said the would. The 5 year warranty is a good deal.

I LOVE the Italian Beef at this place. It's the best in town since Luke's has gone down hill.  Portillo's is not bad, but the meat is better at Lobbys.    Everything here is VERY GOOD. The burgers, dogs, and sausages are all worth trying, but I come back for the Beef Sandwich. Ask for it dipped, it's a sloppy mess of GOODNESS!     The only bad thing I can say about this place is that it has a strange smell frequently.

I am not sure what's up with this place, but they have been closed for a while with a sign on the door saying due to mechanical issues.   I still need my Italian Beef fix. I went to Portillo's down the street, but they are not as good.   Hope they get things worked out soon!

I have been eating at the berto's places for as long as they've been around. This location is one of the better stores! Today I had the best thing I've ever had at any Berto's ever. They have a New Mexico Burro at this location, which is a red or green chili burro, with queso sauce on top. I had the green chili, and it was fantastic!!! I will be back this week to try the red chili version, since the other was so good.   I hope this is something the other stores pick up on.   The only reason they don't get 5 stars is due to the plastic silverware they use. It's the real cheap soft plastic crap, and almost impossible to use.

I stopped in this place for lunch on a friends recommendation. I was impressed by the roast beef sandwich I had. The bread was toasted nicely, and the dressing was very good. It could have used a little more meat, but for $6 with a drink it was very good deal.  I would return here again if I'm in the area. Give them a try.

If you're a chilehead like me, then you MUST try this place. These people do spicy food RIGHT! I just got lunch and dinner here, and the Triple Delight I had for lunch ROCKED!  Beef, shrimp, and fish for $6.95  with rice, and soup.   I had heard good things about this place for a while, and now I am kicking myself for not going sooner. This place is my goto Asian food place now. Try them out you'll not be disappointed.

My 3rd trip in 2 weeks. The BEST Sandwich yet. I had a #11 University...with Ham, Roast Beef, and Turkey. Add the peppers, and avocado to it...MMM. If you're a carnivore you'll like this place. They pile the meat high. Since the most expensive sandwich is $6 w/tax they're a GREAT DEAL! Think of what it would cost for triple meat at subway.

My wife and I have been coming here for almost a year now, and I can say that they are still making GREAT SUBs, but the attention to details are not what they should be. On the last 3 visits I requested peppers on my sandwich, and they failed to put them on. I even reminded the girl making the sandwiches tonight, and she still forgot them.   The staff needs to learn how to read their order tickets. They have failed to make the sandwiches as ordered MANY times now. MY wife always has a #4 which has cheese on it, and requests it without the cheese. Only 2 out of the last 10 trips did they remember not to put the cheese on. I don't mind that since I get the extra cheese on my sandwich, but it is rather sad that they do not listen to their customers.  They need a colored highlighter to mark the items that are added or removed on the order tickets, so that the staff will see the changes. I hope the owner will address this!  They still have the best bread, good portions of meat, and the dressing is GREAT!

I tried this place in NM, and was not impressed. The Hot link was very rubbery. The moist brisket was mostly burnt to charcoal. I though maybe it was just an off night, since they seemed so popular. I tried the Chandler location and found the prices seemed even higher. The ribs had almost NO meat, especially for the money. The lean brisket was very dry. The sauces are very sweet, and they do not have any spicy sauce. They do no real service, it's run like a fast food place. No real silverware only paper and plastic. It's just not worth it. I'll stick to Dave's or Honeybears.

I had been to Rudy's on NM. It was not great, but OK. I decided to give the Chandler store a try. I had the moist brisket, and a jalapeno link. The brisket was mostly burnt to a crisp, and almost half was fat. I could not even chew through the link, and it was very greasy. The beans were plain. The white bread was stale.   This is a HIGH priced self service BBQ joint. Everything is by the pound at the counter. No wait staff. Plastic silverware, and butcher paper is all they have. I would call this low class. Yes it may be what some call traditional, but I like to have real plates and silverware.  Back to the old standby Honeybears or Dave's

I was not impressed with their deluxe cheeseburger. There was just not much flavor, and even adding salt and mustard did not help. The bun stuck to the box on both my wife's, and my burger. This made it very messy to eat.

Went for the first time with some friends, who are regulars here, and had a blast! It was my friend's wife's birthday. This is a popular birthday spot, since they did the birthday song about 8 times in the 2 hours we ate. The show was good, and so was the food! They make everyone have fun by taking a squirt bottle of Sake, and shooting it in your mouth. One guy at our table went to the count of 60, good thing he wasn't driving.  If you go as a couple then do the dinner for two. It's the best deal on the menu for the grill. You get 4 meats for $26 a person. We had the Filet, Scallops, Salmon, and Swordfish. My wife who usually is not a Scallops fan loved them the most.    We'll be back for Sushi, and Rolls. They build some GREAT rolls.

This place has gotten much better than when they first started. They now have some of the best meat and seafood in all of Phoenix. Just got some sushi grade Ahi Tuna today for $6.99/lb. The produce has improved the most. It used to not last long after you got it home, but I have not had that problem in many months now. Outside of a few things at Costco I buy all my food at Sprouts now.   It now even become one or my favorite lunch spots since they have $2.99 deli sandwiches made to order. They are WAY better than the sub shops, except Arizona Sandwich Co.

Today was my first visit to their office. I have to deal with a problem wisdom tooth. I still haven't figured out what pain has to do with wisdom. Dr Pulley also found a few other issues that needed to be addressed, since it's been a few years since my last dentist retired. I have to say the staff was very pleasant, and they made time for me in their already busy week.   My wife and friends have been using Dr. Pulley for some time now, and they have all had great things to say about the services. Dr Pulley performed miracles for one of our friends.   I go back to start the real work in 2 days, so I'll fill in some more later.

I took my wife for happy hour tonight, and tried to start her on sushi some. She has tried it a few times, but not yet become a fan. I think this place may have changed her opinion, and made her a fan. Next time she wants to try a couple rolls, instead of teriyaki chicken.   I had a spicy tuna roll, and a dragon roll that were both on happy hour for cheap. They were both fantastic. They offer black rice with their sushi, and it was EXCELLENT! I tried an order of Sashimi, which was a little small for the price, but the quality was excellent. I also failed to tip the sushi chef first, which may have been the issue.    I will go back, and since my wife liked it that will make it easier. If they can get her hooked on Sushi I would be indebted to them. I want to try their Poke salad, and a few of their other rolls next.   The happy hour here is hard to beat. Give them a try.

My wife and I went back for our 2nd visit at Happy Hour again today. My wife is starting to explore sushi some. After our first visit she told me she wanted to go back and just have sushi, instead of the teriyaki chicken she normally gets. I started her with a Seaweed salad, which she loved. I had a bowl of Poke, which was just average as Poke goes. There was little to no sauce on the Poke, and the bottom of the bowl was filled with rice noodles that were literally 2 to 3 feet long. I stretched a few out above my head trying to separate them. This made it almost impossible to eat with chop sticks. There was a decent amount of tuna, and it also had seaweed and cucumber pieces in it. Not all that great as Poke goes.   Next we had a few pieces of sushi to start. Those you can see in the pictures I added. I was not very impressed with the sushi. After tipping the sushi chef a 5 spot before we started I though the sushi would be better this time. I think it depends on who is working the sushi bar. The pieces were very thin, but I do like their black rice. It seems less starchy. I'm not sure the young sushi chef even noticed my tip, since he was busy texting on his phone. It was the only tip in the jar above his station though, and we were one of two tables in the place with nobody at the bar.   For the next  round we had a spicy tuna roll, a becca roll, and a dragon roll. These are all happy hour items, and they were very good for the price. My wife even decided she like ell now after eating a few pieces of the dragon roll.                                                                   The service was very good, and overall the experience was positive. My wife and I both liked the camera that shows them making your sushi on the big screen above.  We will be back again. I do have to thank them for helping me get my wife started on the journey of sushi. Next time I will try a few more things that are not happy hour items. That way I can see if they make those things a little better, since they're full price items. I think I'll come later in the evening as well, because that seems to be when the Owner or Manager shows up behind the Sushi Bar.

This place has become a weekly treat for my wife and I. The service is always friendly, and they always take good care of us. The prices are reasonable, and the quality has always been good. Like anyplace, some things are a better value than others. Tonight I tried the tuna tataki which was very good, but for $12 it was not that big. I think my favorite roll so far has been the Poke roll. My wife loves the seaweed salad, and on happy hour they're only $2.50 which is a great value, especially for the portion they give you.   One of the thing I do love about this place is the black rice, which is not a starchy as sushi rice typically is. Even if you eat a lot of it, you don't get that bloated feeling from the rice.   One of these days I want to try their all you can eat Korean BBQ, which offers many types of meat, including steak. I saw someone else eating that again tonight, and it does look good. They also have many teppan grills, but I've never seen them in use for a teppan show.   Give this place a try, if you have not been. Maybe we'll see you there next week.

This is one of the nicer stores in their chain. They food is good most of the time for fast food Mexican. We stop in a few times a month, since it's just down the street from us.

I'm sorry, but I have to retract my comment on my recent check in for this place. I have not been here in many months, and on today's visit I again had their Green Chile Burro enchilada style. The burrito was very bland, and had very little meat in it. It was almost completely made of a thick gravy, and nothing else. I saw no Green Chile, and only one or two pieces of onion. I was charged $10.13 for this burrito, and I'm not sure how they got that total since the price was only $8.15. That's just way to much for what it was. In most Mexican restaurants that would have come with chips and salsa, and maybe even rice and beans for that amount. I will not be back again.

The Happy Hour makes this place worthwhile.  My wife and I both had seaweed salads, and we split 5 rolls, for $44. That's hard to beat. Try their Dragon roll. My wife was afraid of eel, but now she loves Dragon rolls. Thank's guys. They also have all you can eat bbq, which I have yet to try.

Since I-Sushi closed down this place has become our new home for sushi. I must say the quality is better than our old haunt. Prices are decent, and the rolls are not mostly rice, even on happy hour items. The spicy tuna roll we had tonight was the best spicy tuna I've ever had anyplace. The nigiri orders were not that big, but the quality was good. I can't wait to go back. Lots of stuff to try out on their menu. My wife is happy again because they have seaweed salad, which is her favorite thing.

I give this store 2 stars because only about 1/2 of the time do they even have what you want. The stock in the store is PATHETIC! They didn't have 5 items on my list of 25 things. Things like stick pretzels. They have 3 brands, and not one bag of stick pretzels was in the store. The Steak selection was a JOKE!. Not one steak more than 1/2 inch thick, and most we're less than that!. $9.56/lb for 3/8th in. NY Strips is not a good deal.   They did not have one rotisserie chick in the store, except for a couple of old shriveled cold ones.

This is the worst neighborhood market store in Arizona. WalMart should throw out the entire staff. They never have more than one staffed checkout. They expect everyone to do it for themselves. They have the worst inventory on most products, which means you can't even find what you want most of the time. I only go here once in a while, because they are half a mile from my house. I think tonights shopping trip was my last. I smelled spoiled food in many areas of the store, and even in the canned food areas which shouldn't smell ever.

My wife, and I had our first visit today, and we WILL BE BACK. Maybe tomorrow for a salad. We both had Pizza made to our liking. We followed some regulars through the line, which was helpful. The one tip I picked up from them was to have the crust covered with Garlic Butter before the sauce...MMM. They put it in with a paint brush. The rest is up to you with 30 toppings to choose from.    Can't wait to try a salad next.

If I could give these guys 10 stars I would. This place ROCKS!   If it's bad it's YOUR fault. They make it YOUR WAY!

Took in a coworker today, who is not a fan of pizza that much, but he bookmarked the site after his first piece of pizza. He then texted his wife to go to the new store in Tucson where he lives. He's a new Fired Pie addict, just like me. My wife, and I come once a week, if we can.   I want to buy stock in this place!

Do your friend's a favor, and bring them here for lunch or dinner. I've turned on 2 more people this week. They are both planning their next pizza's.   Hint: they will do half and half, so pick two pizzas in one.    If it's bad it's your fault.   10 stars!

This is now at least a once per week stop for us. I get no argument from my wife when I ask if she want pizza. It's the best thin crust pizza around. Just give them a try. You will NOT be disappointed I promise.

I only wish these guy's did a deep dish pizza. I like the thin crust, but a deep dish with more sauce and cheese would be AWESOME!  I also wouldn't mind a calzone version, if they don't want to do the deep dish pizza.  Just a though. Like this comment if you agree, and maybe they'll take on the challenge.

It's nice to see that after several months that nothing has changed with the quality of the pizza here. I finally got my wife to come with me to eat the pizza at the store today for the first time. It makes a difference if you eat this hot and fresh out of the oven. The crust is still crispy, and delicious. It only lasts like that through the first 2 or 3 pieces, that is unless you're a power eater. The crunch dies off quickly as the sauce sinks in. It is totally worth eating the pizza there, and even my wife agreed with me on that today.   $8 for a pizza with anything you want on it...what's not to LOVE!

Still my favorite Pizza, and the BEST Pizza value anyplace in town. If you have not been, then what are you waiting for? Eat the Pizza there, because the crispy crust only last about 3 minutes. If you put it in a box, then it will be steamed when you get home.

The food was fantastic! My wife and I went for the first time tonight. I have never liked curry, so I've never been a Thai fan that much, but this place may change that opinion. We had 3 appetizers, and they were all good, but the thailicious dumplings were both our favorite. They are almost meatballs with a small wrapper, and the ginger sauce was excellent!  I think take out on Friday is at hand now. Decisions decisions. :  The only complaint I had was the baseball place next door. Don't sit at the table with the big copper lined lamp over it. The noise and vibration from balls hitting the wall was ridiculous!

We the takeout was very good. I'm hooked on the Thailicious dumplings. We tried out the Spices of life, and the Heaven Ginger w/chicken tonight. Since my mother-in-law was over I ordered both with medium heat, and they were both nicely spiced. Next time I'm ordering something just for me, with the Thai Hot spice, since I love hot and spicy food. Looking forward to our next visit.   I found out the baseball store next door, that hits balls at the wall of the restaurant is closed on Sundays, so that makes it a great time to go. The noise is obnoxious otherwise!

This is the worst station I've been to in the area. Many of the pumps are not in service. The one I used would not read my card. The pump would not stay on with the handle lock, so you had to hold it. They had now towels in any of the bays. Most of the window wash stations were dry.   Never coming back again.

We went here for the first time tonight for some take-out. My wife had the Chicken and avocado panini, and she liked it. Her description was it had a clean taste, meaning she could taste each of the ingredients. It wasn't a decent size panini for $6.  I went for a beef bowl, with noodles and spinach as the base, and with the soy/chili sauce. They have lots of fresh veggies to add to the mix. I added kalamata olives to my mix, which I love, but they use them whole which is a lot of flavor at once. These would be better if they were quartered maybe. The dish was not very spicy at all. I'm not sure if they even added the sauce, or if that's what the packets of sriracha, and soy that came in the bag were. The beef was very lean, but it was sliced up in very thin slices, like you may find on a cheesesteak.   Since the beef bowl did not look that big, and I was hungry, I added a cup of Chicken Noodle soup. It had an odd spice in it, like maybe a little curry. It had lots of meat and pasta, but it was a small container for $1.80. Not something I'll try again.  We'll try them again. It's very close to home, and something different than the rest of the fast food around.      I wish they made the bowls in two sizes. I could have used a little more tonight. It's only been a half hour, and I'm getting hungry again.

I have been a fan of King Gyros for a while now, but there were none close to me. I was overjoyed the other day to see they took over for the Gyro Express,  which was not that great.  I went in the next day for lunch,  and it was GREAT!  The Gyro was stuffed with meat, and the tzatziki sauce was fantastic!  I can't wait to go back and try the pork.

If you're a Gyro junkie like me, then give this place a try. They have the best bang for the buck Greek food in the east valley now. I like the new wrappers they have now, that keep things somewhat contained while you eat the big pita.

Well after seeing several good reviews on here I gave them a try. I had the beef chimi, and it was different. They put big slices of cheese, tomato, onions, and bell peppers in the chimi. This makes them look much bigger than you expect. I have eaten Mexican all over the country, and I've never had anything like this, and I  have to say it just didn't trip my trigger. Not much seasoning, and the green and red sauce was not that great.   I also got a green chili burrito for later, and it was horrible! They used the same shredded beef that was in my beef chimi, and added a small amount of the green tomatilo sauce, and a bunch of rice. There was no green chili in it at all.  The service was friendly and quick, but I was the only one there. The people who wrote good reviews about this place don't have a clue what good Mexican food is!

Clueless employees! Expensive fried food. Tiny drinks. They do not have several sauces for their chicken. The chicken strips were good. Not to much batter, and fried nicely. The fish was not so good. It was under cooked, and very greasy. This place will likely die in a month, or two, unless they improve their processes.
