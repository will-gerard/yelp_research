Don't let the name fool you. The star of the show here is the fish and chips. No shit.. BEST I've had in az. A little pricier than Pete's, but not oversalted, or nearly as tough. The fish is flaky, and believe it or not, wasn't gamey or even 'fishy'. I think they keep it divey to keep out the foodies. Shhh. It's a secret.

Hodori is set in an all asian strip mall, with 2 or 3 other restaurants. That being said, it was the only one PACKED on a tuesday night. I ordered the kimchi fried rice, being my first time there, I didn't want to go too crazy. Despite being busy, it came out in about 5 mins in a hot stone bowl, with sides of pickled cucumbers, daikon, kimchi, sprouts, tofu, and potatoes, all of which, I stirred right into my rice. It could have used a touch more beef, but the fried egg on top was marvelous. As you get to the bottom of the bowl, the rice is more caramelized and crispy..soo good. I took a bite of the kimchi as I left, and as I was riding my bike home my pallette became the CLEANEST it has ever been, the taste in my mouth was like sweet watermelon. Crazy. Best fried rice ever.

I have never been treated so rudely, by a fellow group of native americans. Makes me regret the time and effort I spent trying to help these greedy tribes gain this power, that they now so blatantly abuse. It also makes me rethink the whole legality of it. These apples have red skin, but a white core.

I keep wanting this place to be what it used to be, and keep getting disappointed. There is no other term to describe the $10 yakisoba bowl I received, other than disrespectful.      The "all white" option I ordered were mostly sawdust size scraps, and large ugly chunks of rib meat. I questioned the counter guy, and he immediately hid in the back for the remainder of my visit. I left the uneaten portion on my tray, on the counter as a clear message. I WILL NOT RETURN. Please view the picture I took..for the Kyoto Bowl employees, go eat at your competitor in Tempe Marketplace to taste what you are up against.

Why So smoky? It's like cheech and fucking chongs house in here. Visible plumes of smoke bellowing from ac vents directly above the line of people. Pregnant women and their children inhaling the noxious fumes. Not to mention subjecting your employees to that for hours at a time.   Turkey sandwich, flavorless. Something is wrong here.. I'm completely stoned and it still tastes bland. The smoked mtn dew was good.

Two words, HOUSE CHICKEN. The gentleman at the counter is nothing but polite, and willing to bring me a side of chili paste for my fried rice. A small order of the chicken and a small order of fried rice feeds two, and I'm a big dude. Value, and quality. My two favorite things, for the moment.

Five people waiting to get their haircut, one dude. He turns and tells everyone that the person he is working on is his last before lunch, the other barbers MAY return shortly. Dude thinks he's an airtraffic controller or something, that he is required to take breaks? Also, where are the other four barbers? These lazy asses would rather sit and talk, as opposed to cut hair. This buisness has been here for a while, but they are on their way out. New age? Lol.

pricy, and kind of unclean. I ordered a las vegas roll and some other shit, he reached in the fridge, right in front of me..pulled out a premade roll, dolloped some shit on it and handed it to me. I've waited longer for a fucking hamburger at mcdonalds..The seared tuna I ordered was also seared in advance. I asked the guy about it, and he said: "We make like 500 a day." I replied "how many do you think they make in japan?"..disappointing, lazy, and super gamey tasting shit. Oh, and ask me like ten more times if I want to join your fucking birthday club.

Been coming here for years upon years. First off, Raj makes my life complete. Amazing full bodied IPA that isn't too dry. Second, the food is off the charts here..be it wings, burgers, steaks..just get it and put it in your mouth!! Service is a little shady from time to time, but the food runners, and bartenders more than make up for it..find the hidden bathroom?

Apparently, silverware is to much to ask for. By the time she had any interest in my experience my food was cold. I sent it back, and was assured a 'new' one was being prepared. When the same plate reappeared the plate was hot, both in the rim and underneath, and steam was coming off the veg. The now rubbery $20 fillet had been microwaved to a hefty medium (ordered MR). I was truly excited for this meal, and worse, an out of town family next to me at the bar experienced the dissatisfaction I generated. She also argued weather it was microwaved or not, and provided a list of excuses.When I go out, I don't pay for excuses or conflict. I just want a fucking steak.

Love the pho, but I tried a bun dish last time I went..this is the definition of summer food. Light and refreshing, and it came with an eggroll on top. I wish it hadn't because now I am addicted to them. They have vermecelli in them, its the most amazing texture! Pho and eggrolls are a MUST!

Tried to go in for lunch, a few days ago, and were told there would be a 15min wait for a table..at like 3 in the afternoon with no one else in the place..poor, poor form. Took it down the street and spent money, elsewhere. These are the businesses that are crying about the economy hurting them, when in reality it is their own service and dedication to patrons that falters.

We were so excited to eat a last meal here, before there closing. Called at 5:30 to make a reservation for 6:30. Never received a call back confirming. Arrived with my party at 6:30 to be told there would be no availability until 8. Came back at 8, seated by 8:45 to be told there was no bread. About 50% of the reason anyone goes here. The server tells us they were out for an hour and a half, well before we were seated. They then proceeded to forget two of our sides, one being my roquefort salad, the other 49% of why I go there, and my friends macaroni and cheese. These people have given up. Save your money, sanity, and preserved memory of what this place used to be, because these people murdered it, and sold it out.

Waited 30 mins to find out the girl was skipping me on the waiting list. She said she wasn't skipping me, that there were places for two people to sit, but not one. The last time I checked, one person is able to sit where two people can sit. I don't give a pretty fuck that you are trying to turn more tables, if I am waiting 30 mins, when it's my turn, ITS MY TURN. If someone that came after me, sits before I do, you are skipping me. There is no arguing with me about it. Won't be back.

A stale selection of has been micro brews..the employees rotate more than the taps do..my final day here consisted of me trying to order lunch with a shitty beer the server recommended..and him talking to his frat friends for about fifteen mins before i left three bucks on the bar for the beer I didn't drink, and left. I took a screen shot of the exchange that took place on facebook that was supremely unprofessional..maybe I'll post it..

After sitting at a table for about ten minutes, I asked the bartender why the server was ignoring me, he said there was no server,even though she was clearly present. If you are unable to take my money, I will be more than glad to spend it elsewhere. If you have a secret ordering technique, let a motherfucker know. Sorry, the schedule of servers isn't posted on the wall,and as handsome as I am, I am not psychic. So in total, fuck you, fuck your ignoring ass server, fuck your bar, aand your schedule of servers, that apparently, everyone is supposed to know.

This place just keeps going down, and their prices keep coming up. Their sushi used to be good. The rolls were obviously from another day, or frozen, or something. Bad bad, My drink didn't come until after my second helping of cold fried rice. Who messes up fried rice?? I was so pissed I left without ice cream, then got my bill. 18$ are you out of your mind? I could have eaten three times at Golden Eggroll for that! Garbage. Crab legs, garbage. Sushi, garbage. Chicken, garbage. Service, you guessed it trash. Never going back.

It closes. Like twice to three times a day.  There is a reason they are able to sell $6 loaves of bread. Because, it is a "CONVENIENCE" store. However when a "CONVENIENCE" store closes, it ceases to be "CONVENIENT" I think they have their movies mixed up and are playing hockey on the roof.  Then..the fucking money order thing was down..she said "come back tomorrow" I said "Fuck You."

so i went in again..just to try it one more time... it took over 15 mins for the sandwich to be made, then when the manager was bringing it out, he stopped to converse at the table of a former employee...I was at the counter looking for it, to ask that that make it a to-go order, because i was going to be late..when the manager finally made it back with my order, the sandwich was made incorrectly. this wasn't a custom sandwich either, one of they're own creations. So...the manager offered to give me my money back and apologized. I told him of my last experience, and said he could keep his $20 gift card because i didn't want to waste any more of my time in that expensive, bland, so called "deli".

First time here. Was a little concerned upon entry, with their picture book menu, but the sushi is freaking great. Went with a regular spicy maki, and a fire roll. Upon delivery I realized the fire had avocados in it. I'm not allergic, but my stomach HATES them. The waitress sensed my disdain after she witnessed me double checking the menu. She said it would be no problem to replace it, and the chef didn't even seem mad. I'll be back.

Food took forever. Came out bland, and tasteless. Mac and cheese was mush. Yams were mush. Ordered smothered pork chops, received one pork, one beef. I didn't get sick from any cross contamination, but I didn't eat the beef chop. They were two completely different colors, but they insisted it was pork.$16 and all I ate was a pork chop, two bites of each side. None of the burnt cornbread.. and two glasses of koolaid.

Went there last night with my homie, and his bro..ordered one of the combos that looked amazing..the bread was off the chain with the most awesome apple butter I ever tasted..the salad was a little small, but I figured the entree would make up for it. I got the tri-tip with the brisket, with fries and mac and cheese...the whole thing was amazing, with a side of the hot and spicy bbq sauce, i was in heaven..could have been a little bigger, I licked my plate clean.

This spot just opened up about a week ago. They're bread is off the hook, and the meat and cheese selection is above adequate. Build your own, or choose one of the hangover themed delicacies. Either way, you are in for a treat. They are still putting in tables, so I suggest taking them to go, for now..when this place gets up and going completely...it will be the monster of university area delis.

The translated "Il Vinaio" is an ancient Italian word meaning "polished turd". The pretentious menu, the "Denny's" environment. The dated and uninspiring wine list. Fake yelp reviews, rude replies to yelp reviews.  Reviews that have no other reviews or friends, are obviously  fake yelp profiles, sad . Clearly unprofessional "foodies" have no place in the restaurant industry, this place makes the Taco Bell next door  look bad. Keep polishing that turd, I heard the best way is to suck at both ends.

I agree with Megh...  DO NOT ENTER THE DOORS  8 bucks for half an Italian sandwich and an orange crush.  Menu reads: Italian Sanwich: Ham, Salami, Peperoni, lettuce, tomato, mayo  What I got: Ham, Cheese, Sausage?, tzatziki?, bacon?, onions? and a side of attitude from the guy at the counter for asking him what all this crap was on my food...prick.   This place is close to where I live, so I was happy to see they served sandwhiches...but after today..

Just had my first bad experience here. The counter girl, Courteney from the receipt was rushing people out before 9pm. She turned off the TV denied the people after me the majority of the menu,  then completely denied the people after that. She then dimmed the lights. The food is phenomenal here. The sushi and the bowls are freaking awesome.  If I'm paying $20 bucks for two rolls and $2 for a soda I will enjoy them. Even if I told you the order was for here. Marked as here on my receipt, but bagged to go. I will come in specifically at 850 every night just to order a soda.

the food here is garbage. It is nastier than their dirty menus, dirtier than the dredlocked girl picking her nose serving it. The bar is like a beer slip and slide. The only highlight of this place are the underage hipsters that flock to this place because, of the horrible service. I would rather eat a razor blade than dine here, and I would much rather bend over backward and spank myself than ever go to another show here. This place can kiss the middle region of my ass.

the promise of homemade turkey and roast beef drew me in, much to my dismay it's shredded. As Ramsey would say 'like a dog's dinner!'. I got the bobby with roast beef, so i could taste both. The bread was good, the stuffing was cold. The meat was chokingly dry. Dry dry. Sawdust tasting. I'm sure the other non shredded meats are great on that bread, this might as well had just been the stuffing and cranberries on the bread. Plus, the manager was bragging about how he just stands around and does nothing but micro manage. Donkeys! Lol. Make that guy clean the bathrooms!

My new favorite restaurant. I have been here twice, now..the first time just randomly chose the chicken achari, and was completely amazed, the flavors exploded across my palate, with the subtle heat in the finish, was like nothing I've ever experienced. I upgraded to the potato naan, which is mashed potatoes stuffed between two delicious pieces of grilled bread..my second time, I got the curry sampler, combo thingy..three different curries, pickled onions, naan, and yogurt sauce..this is the way to go..always upgrade to the potato naan! The combo said it came with a desert on the menu, but not in reality..still the cold leftovers were a perfect finish..

Shocked to see poor reviews! Here is the thing, this place is a taco spot. Not a rice and bean specialty store. The tempura fish tacos are the best in the valley, and the prices are so reasonable that you can afford a beer with your meal! Stick to the tacos. Or call uncle fucking ben.

A note to the girl eating behind the counter, besides disgusting the customers, the health code regarding these issues is meant to protect you from putting the filth from the money you are touching into your mouth. Also, being out of tacos on taco Tuesday is just wrong. Especially with the new competition in town, that got my money tonight..

Right off the bat, the told me "no, you cant sit at the outside bar, it's closed"...okay..I'll sit at the inside one. There where only 51 beers on tap, and I have tried all of them numerous times. Nothing special. Not one. Nothing special about the menu either, I ordered 2 apps for myself..the seared ahi, and some potato cakes..both came with this napa slaw, that was great with the ahi, but not to great with the cakes..if you want a pricey beer that you can find anywhere, and an unimaginative menu doused in napa slaw, this is the spot...and don't you dare try to sit at the outside bar, ever.

wish I had read the other review. lady took 8 orders prossesed cash and cards, then without washing her hands made everyone's food one order at a time. waited 15 mins for old fries, a hot dog that was already on the grill when I ordered and paid $9. fuck you Nathan's, and fuck you aramark.

The brisket was ok. The sauce was spicy, the portion was right. The mac and cheese was awful and cold. I made sure to make eye contact with the guy as I threw the majority in the trash.

Usually buffets start out sparkling clean, and serving only the finest food. Smiling chefs, and pristine service usually declines after a year or so. This place just opened, and the food is already stale and bland. Sushi chef dogging you every time you walk by. Dirty floor and tables. They gave up from the start.

I was happy to see another "non-hookah" related establishment go up in my neighborhood. I tried a crossaint breakfast sandwich and a GIANT green tea. Came out to $11. The tea was great. The $6 sandwich was smaller than my fist. I realize this is a "health" food place and that "we use fresh produce whenever available" but I left hungry. I hope they realize how tough the summer will be.

Ordered Hatch Burger mid rare with sweet tots. After about 20 mins it comes out minus the aioli, and overcooked to the point it needs the extra lube, and tots are ice cold..I tell the server the Burger is overcooked, and missing the sauce. Here's the important part, all I wanted at that point was the sauce. Not the management attention, not the rolling eyes of the judging server, not compensation, free food, sympathy, or a hug, just the aioli that was promised on the description. They took it very personally, like their elderly grandpa was back their flipping those grisly hockey pucks..long story short I got the sauce, the burger was comped. The tots remained frozen to the plate. I left, never to return.

First time I went they were out of 4 or 5 items, so I came back a few days later, got some crappy overcooked Mac and cheese, flavorless brisket, on a cold hard bun. Went back today and they were closed during hours posted. Place won't see the new year.

Been to all these "otokoy bowl" types all over. This one has great flavor. The chicken is seasoned and marinated. Simple things like kombu on the rice. Impressed.

Got a basic four piece. Cole slaw is banging, fries are crinkle cut, comes with a kind of rémoulade sauce, or a spicy ranch, that is really good. Chicken had been sitting in a steambox for a while, I was just about to get grumpy, when dude came over and asked if everything was okay..you know me..lol. I told him everything was great but the chicken, he ran back, and brought me 4 fresh pieces that were juicy but not rubbery. Place has a disco ball, and a bose sound system, playing all the crappy house covers you can imagine, I figure they support gay marriage..lmao

Had an issue, and the management immediately solved it. No eye rolling, just respect for food and great service. Awesome. At this point they could spit on the food, and I would be happy.

Signed up for tickets to the grand opening, and was completely blown away. The patio is comfortable, and relaxing. The environment is upscale but not sterile. The beer selection was great, and the list of cocktails and shandys are clever and inviting. I was promised food, and did not receive a bite. Only drawback of a remarkable experience. I will definitely return.

I arrived before my party, hungry. It was a Friday night, I was sat in a high top, near the bar. I ordered an app right away..a crispy rock shrimp($14). The remoulade was to die for, with diced kalamata. I ordered the ribeye with gratin potatoes for my entree ($27). My other 2 guests arrived, and ordered a burger, and 2 add ons of pork belly. Here's where it gets murky..one pork belly dish arrived, so we thought it was the two sides combined, then a few mins later, another small side appears, we send it back, because we thought we already had received ours, it turns out, when we get the check he rang us in for 2 pork belly appetizers (received only one app plate) I was trying to eat my ribeye, and explain to the server what had happened, (he seemed super busy, and impatient the whole experience, rushing my friends through their orders.) He took the app that we didn't order, or receive off, thankfully..but still charged us full price for the one we didn't order. The steak was great paired with the remoulade that I'm in love with, the gratin was cold in the middle. Sad. The service was rushed, and towards the end, the hostess approached us, and asked if we, meaning my friend and I would help her move our table, so the band could set up. She looked shocked when I simply replied "no". The place doubles as an art gallery, which is neat, but they were featuring about 4 different artists, with 4 different color schemes, and even varying styles. Pretty painful to the eye. All in all, it's an okay place set in a stip mall, decorated with the Sunday comics.

I'm so angry and confused right now. Whoever came up with this concept should be beaten severely. I can't imagine how the elderly are taking it. I'd rather have hoards of obese children running and screaming, than this abomination.

Don't be fooled in to thinking this is just some donut shop, they have awesome sandwiches, and breakfast. The price and 24hr service is/are STELLAR.

Said they lost my card, but still were able to charge it..with a 20% tip. Menu is a culinary abortion. Service is constantly bad with an attitude. This place won't last another summer.

Caught them on an off moment or something..I ordered lime soda, and a lady with a bleu cheese side salad. Received lemon, and a lady with a vinaigrette side salad..but that didn't matter, because I never got a fork to eat it with. By the time she came back, I had eaten the average hot dog concoction, built on naan, with indecipherable flavors that didn't taste like the description. I mentioned the dressing error, and no fork thing and asked for only the check. She runs in the back trying to remake the salad, or repair the error, which took another 5mins. I throw $15 on the table, hoping that will cover it, and start to leave..she comes out with salad in hand, still no check..maybe a food truck is the best bet.

Changed the hours on me. Wouldn't have been so painful if he hadn't locked the door in my face at 6:02. CONSISTENCY is key.

Holy God this took forever! I get pissed and stand up to realize my food just chilling behind the counter. Fries, cold as fuck, that's OK, they're nasty as ass anyway. The best part is there's a little ticket that shows what time the order was done..5 mins it sat there. Chuckbox. Always. Never forget.

The use of a "complex" ordering system keeps the low iq people, like the gentleman below out. The sandwich was soooo good. The muffeletta had an awesome tapenade, cronic.  A little pricey, but they pile the meat on there. The 3star review is because of the bossy manager lady constantly yelling and micro managing the lackeys like she was Gordon Ramsey. Oh. They have melloyello, too.

The thought of an $12 breakfast still has me reeling. The portion was nice, and the quality was okay. Corned beef hash was waaay over seasoned with a burned oregano overtone , while the hashbrowns, were completely flavorless, and raw in the middle. Ironically(?) the biscuits were damn good.  I ate like an 1/8 of it. (See picture).

Closed during posted hours.  Will not be back. Consistency is the key to success. This place will be closed by August.

My first visit, I was confused a little about the concept, but the food cleared that up. For how busy it was on a sunday, I was a little concerned, but was immediately sat, and served, crab legs came out quick, and hot..the spice butter stuff was AMAZING, I ordered medium, and it was hot as fuck, so be careful with that shit. Prices were more than fair! I got out with about $20 in damage, and was overly satisfied.

I think they forgot how a restaurant works. Let me refresh your memory. The menu says what you have, I choose, you cook, I eat, I pay. This was like,  your menu is just suggestions as to what you may and may not have,  in portions you may or may not want. I order, you check and see if it's okay with the cooks, take a while, forget, come back and tell me what I want is only available in 2.5x the size I want ( on the menu as 1lb). Then argue with me, then call someone on your headset as I leave.  Strange concept.

This venue is a step above every other venue in regards to customer safety, and sound. The precautions taken are necessary,  friendly,  and swift. Most shows are all ages, so liquor control is a priority. Tyler and Dennis are friendly and prompt. Ask them for the special.

Flavorless sandwich with inconsistent hours. Called during posted "business hours" and they were not open. Please do not waste my time.

Perfect waffle. The chicken was under seasoned,  nothing a little hot sauce can't cure. Got the breakfast chicken and waffles.  Was a huge portion.  Everything was fresh and hot. Gravy was thick and awesome. Nothing out does this waffle tho.  Wow. It was super dead when I came service was quick, and the food came fast as well.

I always see at least one person touching ready to eat food with bare hands. Always the fry cook, and this time the drink guy was manipulating ice spillage back into the bin..bare hands..boo
