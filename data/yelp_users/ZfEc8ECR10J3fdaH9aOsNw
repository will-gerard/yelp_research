Great burgers. Expensive beer. Extra star for playing Miley's "I adore you" while I'm out with my husbear

Took my Daddy here to get his beard trimmed and while they did a fairly decent job of the cut, Victoria needs to learn a little customer service (and how to even out a mustache properly!)

Took my car in to get my back right tire repaired/replaced as it had deflated from a screw in the tread and after I said I'd like to shop around (I was quoted $100/ea not including labor and disposal, AND told I needed 3 new tires) they proceeded to make me wait 20 minutes for my keys and when I confronted the service rep about the delay, he fwd'd some bullshit $0.00 "receipt" to another rep so that I could be led away from the view of my car in the garage and sign it in a private office while another employee in the garage proceeded to vandalize my front left tire.  I had to drive at 25mph for 1.5 miles to ensure it would not deflate entirely and got ALL THREE they originally suggested replaced at Discount Tires for $225 OUT THE DOOR.  If I'd been less upset about waiting, I may have bothered to remember each individual service reps' names - but I'd strongly recommend just skipping over this establishment entirely.  If you're the business owner reading this, please consider reviewing any camera footage you've hopefully had the foresight to implement in your garage and pay attention to the 2006 Honda Accord LX SE that was present on your lot between roughly 9:15am-9:50am this day of May 10, 2016.

fantastic food, oustanding prices, and one of the best salsa bars in town - realize that your eyes WILL be too big for your stomach, so be sure to tip when you get your to-go boxes!  The carne asada fries were legit, the chimichanga was out of this world and the shrimp quesadilla made me miss the beach it was so fresh.  This is by far my favorite 'berto in the valley!

There are few places where 5 grown men can go and eat their fill of absolutely impeccable North Indian cuisine the likes of which I had yet to have tasted outside my home town of Fremont in California, accompanied by a never-ending supply of sweet, cool, creamy mango lassi at no extra charge; throughout, consuming a gut-busting pint of a bright and crisp, wheaty Taj Mahal all while being graced with the type of service I've only experienced traveling abroad - for less than US$100.    Did I mention they have the cleanest public men's restroom in the entire valley?  With an f-ing chandelier in it?  Basically what I'm saying is: eat there, be merry, and for the love of god please leave a nice tip because I'll die if this place shuts down.

Cute,  quiet place to have a nice date =) very intimate, don't expect to have a party here.  The food was amazing; potstickers, panang curry,  Thai iced Tea, duck pineapple curry and delicious coconut pineapple ice cream to finish it all off! My hubby is now officially in a food coma, lol, and I've found my new favorite thai restaurant!

This is my favorite place to eat for lunch - I have an honest belief it will be the 'Chipotle' of fantastically delicious, reasonably priced, Mediterranean/Middle-East inspired cuisine within the next 5 to 10 years!  Everything tastes super fresh (try the garlic aioli!!), is incredibly filling (portions are spot-on), and did I mention it's easily less than $9 a person???  Make sure you tip well!

Put simply?  Everything I ordered from here clearly came out of a box , can, or the freezer.  To top it all off, the delivery guy was 30 minutes late.  I ordered Hummus + the Kofta plate and my two sides were rice and tabouleh.  Hummus: the only edible part of the meal - it was nothing special, I was just hungry.  Kofta: clearly pre-packaged and frozen initially, the chef was kind enough to char the outside black while keeping the ground beef raw and pink on the inside.  I wouldn't feed this to a dog.  Rice: Go get a box of Uncle Ben's minute rice and you've made 1/3 of this meal already.  Tabouleh: I don't know what that stuff is, but calling it tabouleh is tantamount to perjury.  I guess this is what I get for trying to go "cheap" ($18 for this SH*T?!?!) with "mediterranean" cuisine.  They get two stars because....maybe their pizza is better?  I'm not gonna bother to find out.
