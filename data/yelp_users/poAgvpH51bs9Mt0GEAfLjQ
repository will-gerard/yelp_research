I can't say enough good things about this UPS Store. They are always very friendly and helpful when I come in. I do a lot of online shopping and they gladly ship my returns out. They do not charge me for tape and always give me a receipt. Recently I was running late and I stopped in the store 1 minute before they closed. They were still very happy to assist me and my transaction was fast and smooth. Will always use them for my future shipping needs.

This place is awful. I will never go to this UPS store again. They made me pay $2 for tape to seal a box for something that I returning to Amazon. I have gone to many other UPS stores and they have never charged me for this. I have plenty of other shipping choices around me, so replacing the store with someone else is an easy task for all my future shipping needs. I think the employee at the store just didn't know what was going on also. The lady that was making copies in the store was miss charged for some copies she was making. Get it together, it shouldn't be that hard to run a UPS store.

Upon my arrival at The Brown Bag I was greated by Jerry. He was very friendly and I believe he was the owner of the restaurant. I wanted to get a salad and I ended up getting the La Cocina, which was very good. I also got a daydreamer frappe. The frappe could have been better. I only got htis because someone else on yelp highly recommended it. I think the issue was the employee that made the drink though. I would expect the frappe to be a little thicker and resemble a milk shake almost. This frappe was the consistancy of an iced coffee and very gritty.   I got my salad to go and enjoyed it at home. The homemade dressing that comes with the salad was delecious. There was tons of chicken in the salad and lots of roasted red peppers. I enjoyed the salad and will look forward to going back to try a differnt one.   The reason why I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service could have just been a little bit better. It seemed like it was taking them a while to make sandwiches and some of the customers were not to pleased with it. This could have been a back of house training issue, it sounded like they just hired someone new and they were not trained properly. Also my day dreamer was made after my salad came out. Jerry told me he was going to make my drink three times and ended up pushing it off to another employee who then pushed it off to "the new girl."

The staff was great and very friendly. They wanted to make sure I was satisfied in everyway possible. For a donut shop, I feel like their coffee selection and equipment was not what it should have been. The donuts were good, but heavy. I personally like a lighter and fluffier donut. These donuts were dense and because they were dense seemed to hold more of the oil they were cooked in. Everyone has their own preference, I did enjoy them none the less.
