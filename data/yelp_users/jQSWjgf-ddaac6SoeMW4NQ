Best quality fish in the valley! I love visiting and sitting at the bar and learning all there is to know about sushi from the owner and managing partner. Absolute favorite place, expensive ... But you pay for the quality.   If you don't appreciate good fish you wouldn't know how to appreciate Toyoma.

I've always had a Consistent experience at Teharu. The food is good but it definitely lacks quality. Knowing that if you're okay with it and you will have a pleasurable experience as well. The best part about to Teharu is that you are in and out very quickly and able to grab the quickest bite in town.   I highly recommend the spicy tuna hand roll

Both doctors at this practice are absolutely amazing. My experience has been with Dr. Martin and there isn't enough positive things I can say about her personally and professionally. Her outlook on the crazy experience that pregnancy is,  allows her patients to have a clear and straightforward understanding. She has been so supportive pre-pregnancy and throughout my pregnancy was a wealth of knowledge and provided the right support that my husband and I needed  as first time parents. Although she is now sadly out of network for me now if I were to get pregnant again (with #2) I would definitely and only have Dr. Martin deliver my baby. I highly recommend Dr. Martin to any and all women who are looking for a great OB in the area. The staff  is extremely friendly and personable. I had a great time each visit catching up with the girls, from the front desk to the U/S tech to the phlebotomist.    Dr. Martin's assistant Chrissy made me look forward to each of my visits. I can confidently say her support enhanced our entire experience overall and truly making my husband and I feel like a top priority at the practice.  Wonderful wonderful practice and people!

When I crave good pizza... Pomo is the only place on my mind.. Always. The char on the pizza is to die for - not to mention all the ingredients used in all their dishes is straight from Naples. The owner, Stephano is a great guy. He is funny, pops around all over the Resturant makes sure quality is always on point. Highly highly recommended as a Resturant and also for a quick bite at the counter!

Never been personally spray tanned before! Totally worth it! It gave me the base tan I needed going into the summer season. Staff is nice, as a new business they do seem short staffed so hopefully they staff up as they grow..and as always, Chardonay is always welcome!  I would recommend moving the lockers away from the main entrance so waiting guests aren't looking at you... that was a tad awkward. I was guilt of doing it to, as I waited for my spray tan.

Totally the worst bar in Scottsdale. The owners have no respect for women and the bouncers are meat head thugs. From a foodie perspective, every drink tastes watered down. You have duck fat fries but no blue cheese stuffed olives. I rather spend my money elsewhere.

Super friendly staff for lunch. My husband and I know good quality fish and we do have to say the quality at Nori was very good. We are pleased with the quality of three sushi restaurants so far, Shin Bay, Toyoma and Nori. Hope this place could lower their prices a bit. For lunch we spent $100 that's a lot!

This is a new establishment but I can say it was one of the more frustrating experiences for my husband and I. I hate when reviewers comment on the decor first .... But this place is really nothing special. I read the reviews prior - so food reviews were pretty good - and though we should try it. To our dismay we ordered some nigiri - Spanish Mackerel + salmon and a spicy yellowtail maki. Nigiri was a no-go. The quality of the rice was not what we expected, especially for the price point. They should charge much less due to the quality of the fish. There is no denying that his place may do "okay" as they have a ton of Maki and Speciality Rolls to offer non-traditionalists. The quality was not there and My advice would be to go to Toyoma if your looking for authentic Japanese sushi in north Scottsdale. I will say the staff and owner were very kind and friendly, and wanted to learn about our experience. Having had the best and some of the worst sushi throughout my years, it's important to keep in mind the quality and price point really have to meet eye to eye. For the price point they offer - I'd go to Toyoma or even Sushi Roku. For quality comparison- I'd go to Teharu on Frank Loyd Wright.
