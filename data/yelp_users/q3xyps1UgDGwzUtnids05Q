Tried this place last night... its very good location with a nice patio. The food was fresh and was good. I only gave it 4 out of 5 just because I have tried Thai food twice now and really not impressed. Food not that favorable. I think I will be sticking with Chinese and Japanese.

So... I went to this place off of word of mouth for goo thai food. I took my 2 sisters and a friend. Tea was really good so I thought we were off to a good start.  My sister started off with cabbage raps that were over salted and not good. We all placed an order for different things so that we can get a feel for the restaurant. I ordered a noodle dish.... they brought me a rice dish. I was trying to tell the waiter that the dish was wrong and they were very rude and would not help me at all. I attempted to waive down another waiter and asked for a manager and they told me that he would not come out. After that My 9 months pregnant sister was served her sweet chicken.. (now keep in mind she is a little less patience then normal in this last month so not so easy to please).. gets her food and it was cold and bland and dry. She asked for them to fix it and got push back so then asked if can then order something else. The waitress said yes and then took the order. 15 Min goes by and she asked what was the eta of her food and the waitress said that they manager told her that she sent her food back and that he was not making her anything else....... Crazy right! SHE WAS VERY UPSET, NOT ONLY DID THEY SAY THAT THEY WOULD BUT THEN THEY DIDNT EVEN TELL HER THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BRING HER ANYTHING ELSE.  We asked to speak to a manager and then he came out from the kitchen and yelled at us to get out and leave that he will no longer serve us.   I don't care how good the food is....THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. I HAVE WORKED FOR RESTURANTS AND HAVE NEVER HAD PEOPLE TREAT THERE CUSTOMERS THIS WAY!!!!!!

Love it!!! Way better than Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in Cali.. I crave chicken now. I recomend that you dont eat all day before you come becuase the portions are large. Yum

Purchased a groupon for this place and I love it!! I took my niece here for brunch and she is 12 and loved it as well. The steak with the egg is such a good combination. Whenever I go into a restaurant you can usually tell if you are going to like it by the ingredients that you can see. Well I saw all the right things! Lemon, Garlic, Onion, and much more. Definitely will be returning. I live by desert ridge but its worth the drive.

The guys that they have working the front were jerks!! I went to meet up with friends for table service and the jerks at the front would not let me in. They wouldn't even talk to me to let them know that I was paying for bottle service. I waited for 30 minutes and took my money somewhere else. This place is a joke! If it wants to maintain the reputation that they are putting out there, the they need to get organized with the lines in front, hire better bouncers who are not jerks, and not to turn away or make people wait for 30 minutes who are paying for bottles. I will not be back... This place will crash soon. I'm not the only one, many of my friends have had the same  results  and will not be waisting there time either.  People don't waist your time!!!  Oh! And I'm not a lame unattractive douche bag either... I'm a hot 24 year old educated women.  Believe me when I do bottle service this weekend for my 25th bday.. It won't be at "The Mint"!!
