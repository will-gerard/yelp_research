I have been hearing about this place for over two years now from my coworker.  He had been bragging about it being the best authentic Mexican food here in Phoenix.  So finally today for lunch I decided I need to go try this place out.  I was very glad I finally went.  I had the lunch special of a stuffed poblano and shrimp enchilada.  While waiting on my food I was greated with chips and a yummy spicy salsa and a soup with veggies and beef.  Both were very good and I was then worrying that I wouldn't have room to finish my meal.  Before I could decide to put away the chips the food arrived.  I was surprised how fast they cooked my meal and once I tasted it I was amazed with the great flavor of the sauces.  The enchilada had a very good tasting green sauce and the chile was smothered in a spicy red sauce with onions.  The rice and beans on the side were good but after finishing the main course I had just a bite of each to see what they tasted like.  I will have to head back again for dinner as the menu was full of wonderful items I wanted to try.

Went for a quick lunch today and am so happy.  I have found a new spot to add to my best Mexican places in the valley.  I had the chilaquiles and WOW they were amazing.  So much flavor alone then I added the Habenero salsa and it was like a bomb going off spicing up the dish just right.  They also have the Pepsi in the bottle which I got for my beverage.  The rest of the menu looked amazing and they have $1 tacos for the value minded people.  Definitely check this place out you won't regret it.

My Dad and I went to get some latin food.  I have been before so I knew what to expect.  This place has really good authentic food at a really good price.    I got the Posole which was excellent and a huge portion and I got a beef tamale.  I also had the cantaloupe drink and it was awesome.    If you haven't been you gotta check this place out.

I love La Tolteca the variety of truly authentic Mexican fare.    My Mom was in town from Alaska and craving some good Mexican food so I took here to La Tolteca to get her fix.  We had a shrimp ceviche tostada, lengua taco, taco al pastor, and chile rellanos.  All were excellent and with the habenero salsa they had a nice kick that left a tickle in our throats.    I will for sure be back and I know anytime my Mom visits this is a must eat place for her.

After hearing about this place for a few years I was really excited to finally try it out.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the quality of the food.    I had the bacon cheeseburger I know I know you are thinking how can you mess up a cheeseburger especially one with bacon on it.  I was thinking the same thing, but the patty was frozen and lacking any flavor of juiciness.  A burger is supposed to be juicy and full of flavor due to the fat melting into the meat.  This was a greyish color flavorless disc of supposed beef.    The only reason I gave two stars is the ice cream soda I had was good.  I had the pineapple upside down cake and I would actually go back just for that.  It's just hard to go back to a restaurant when all you want is a drink.

After having Ceviche tostadas on my trip to Coachella in Indio I have been craving them ever since.  So I decided to turn to Yelp to search for a place to feed my craving here in Phoenix.    I found Mariscos Playa Hermosa was the highest rated ceviche in Phoenix so I figured this was the place to go.  So Sunday afternoon I was craving some seafood and I thought no time was better then the present to try this place out.   I walked in and the place is as colorful as can be.  The artwork on the chairs match the tables and each set was different.  I was just hoping the food lived up to the reviews and the color of the place.    I got seated and placed my order one fish and one crab ceviche tostada.  I got chips and salsa dropped off at the table and the red salsa was nice and spicy.  The green had a great flavor but not much spice.    My tostadas came out pretty quick and WOW they were amazing.  The crab was my favorite lots of meat and just full of flavor.  The fish was really flavorful as well.  After stuffing my face with this tostada goodness I was full so I didn't order anything else off the menu.  I will be back for sure as the whole menu looks amazing.  If you haven't been and you like seafood get in your car and go NOW.  :)  They have happy hour daily from 4-7 which I will keep in my memory for future trips.

Camarones aguachile are aweeeeeeeeeeeeeesome!!!  I love this place if you like seafood and Mexican food then look no further this place is the bomb.  The service is good, they have great drinks alcoholic and non, and the food is amazing.  Plus the ceviche tostada for free at the beginning along with chips and salsa just tops off how wonderful this place is.    I admit it is pricey but the ingredients are fresh and we are in the desert so you gotta pay for good stuff and this place is for sure worth it.

I took a car in for a pre-purchase inspection and was glad to know i have a reasonable Mercedes service center 20 blocks from my house. They did a very good job at scoping out the whole car to make sure I wasn't buying something I may soon regret.  They also do the type A and type B services here at a cheaper than dealer rate as well.    When I stopped in I noticed several classic Mercedes in the stalls getting serviced and I know if people that trust them to work on those beauties I could trust them in the future with my car.  I will be back as I bought the car and I'll feel that my car is in great hands.

Went last night for the USA vs. Honduras soccer match.  At first the feed wasn't working but after most people left I stuck around and got a front row seat and then the feed came on.  Was a great game and great environment all cheering for the Yanks except two behind me from Honduras.    I ate the potato skins which were pretty good and had some great 4 Peaks Kiltlifter beer.  Cheap tab and a USA win good way to spend a Saturday night.

I've taken two different cars here with great results every time.  They really know the ins and outs of BMW's and Mercedes.  I've never been upsold for anything I didn't need.  They also are very good about giving you a ride to work or back home if needed.

Great wine selection and even better prices.    They carry a lot of stuff from around the world which is awesome lot's of foods and collectables.  They have all sorts of interior decorative products, plates, glasses, kitchen tools.  It's just a great store.

So last night I experienced the Armadillo for the first time.  I honestly wasn't impressed from the amount of good and great reviews I've seen.   As a sports bar they have plenty of tv's and the game audio on which is nice.  There is not much good seating around the restaurant so eat at the bar if you can.    The food was just ok.  I had the Louisiana shrimp.  I don't know how they can call them Louisiana shrimp because everytime I've had BBQ shrimp in New Orleans they are good size shrimp.  These were tiny little shrimp drowned in sauce.  The sauce however was good and there is plenty of bread to scoop it up and eat it with.    They have several beer options which is nice and a full bar for mixed drinks and shots.    If you just are looking for a divish type bar to watch the game at with just decent food then this would be a good spot but there are many options of places like that I feel have way better food.   2.5/5

What a swanky little establishment. Great music selection great scenery and great waitstaff. I was greeted by Adam who suggested some great drinks and got us a table in no time. Our waitress Tasha was incredible as well. This place is for sure in the Arcadia rotation. 5 stars.

So I am heading to NOLA for a vacation next week and no better way to prep for the mouth orgasm I'm about to have then head to Baby Kay's.  For the Phoenix Valley this has to be the best Cajun food around.    I ordered the Cajun combination which is a cup of each: Seafood Gumbo, Crawfish Etouffee, and sausage jambalaya.  Also on the side you get garlic bread and potato salad.    The Seafood Gumbo was the only one I didn't enjoy it was just ok nothing like I thought it was going to be.  I should have taken the downgraded chicken gumbo.    The Crawfish Etouffee was awesome it was the best of the three.  It was full of flavor and just yummy.  I think next time I will order just that alone.    The Jambalaya was good but after the Etouffee it unfortunately was judged unfairly :).  It did have huge chunks of great sausage and tasted good.    They tried to sell me on dessert but I was so stuffed I didn't even finish my side of potato salad.  3 cups of food actually is a lot more than it sounds like.    I will be back for sure as this place is a true gem and they have Abita beer which always scores points in my book.

Holly is one of the few people I've been to in this town that can cut my fade like it is supposed to be done.  I have had so many people try to high and tight my hair or just unable to get the fade properly.  Great Clips is very reasonable for price as well as I am in every two weeks to keep my hair short.

Popped in for the $5 wine and tasty bruschetta.  As always was amazing.  The wine was a Chardonnay from Washington called Mirth and it was very good.  Being from Washington I was surprised I had never tried it before but I'm glad I know about it now.  I went with 4 kinds of bruschetta first the smoked salmon and pesto one of my fav's then keeping with the pesto theme I had the salami and pesto, then the traditional tomato mozzarella and basil, and last a new one for me tuna and olives which was amazing.  I love this place if you have never been your missing out and if you have been you know it's always a great meal.

What can I say other than it's close to my house and they have some essentials I need.    The store is ghetto and the meat/seafood counter selection is just as bad.    The deli is the saving grace here as they have a huge boars head selection sliced to order and great cheese.  The checkout lines are always a wait.

So after driving by this place for a few years always wanting to try it out I finally did.  I am so thankful reading the yelp reviews helped my decision to finally try this place out cause it is some of the best cuban food I've ever had.    For starters I got the calypso chips which are fried plantain chips and a black bean dip.  So awesome I could have just had that.  I also got this brazilian sugar cane drink with lime juice that was a twist on a mojito and it was awesome.    For my entree I got the Boliche Mechado which is a Cuban pot roast stuffed with Spanish chorizo and simmered in a red wine sauce. Served with spicy potatoes which also were just excellent.  I am a huge chorizo fan so when I saw this on the menu I knew it was the choice.    I was too full for dessert so I couldn't try any of the amazing selections that were on the menu but I will be back for that for sure.  Also they have paella which I must go back for cause it had chorizo, scallops, clams, and mussles.  Sounds delicious.    Thanks again yelp for another push to try a local hot spot.

Last night I went back to Havana Cafe with a groupon and wasn't as excited when I left.  For starters we get there and go to ask for a table and get wait time and the head of the house says it's like 20-30 min wait you sure you want to wait and we said yes that's fine and he goes ok and walks off shaking his head.  We were a little caught by surprise as that's not very professional but whatever he wasn't the cook.  So we sit down and wait and notice he is trying to get people to not wait and leave every single party that came up asking for a table as a matter of fact.  Many of us waiting have started to laugh at how horrible this guy is.  He even went as far as saying ya it's over a 30 min. wait so I wouldn't wait if I were you.  OMG really??? I hope the owner reads this and does something because if that was my restaurant I would be pissed.    Anyways on to the meal.  Laura A. and I shared the Tapas sampler which was good it comes with a Tamal Cubano which was excellent, some Chorizo and vegetables, Frituras de Frijoles, Maduros Fritos, Bacalaitos Fritos, and a couple Croquetas.  It was perfect for the two of us to share but there was a lot of fried on the plate which wasn't as much variety as we would hope for.    We both finished the meal with coffee she got the Café Cubano which was a sweet espresso and I went with the Moro Castle which had Dark rum, Bailey's and butterscotch schnapps combined with Cuban coffee it was a nice way to end the evening and enjoy with dessert which we shared a coconut flan with mango sauce.  The dessert was good not great though I am a huge flan fan and I have had better.    So overall I would say the meal was a 3.5 but the front of the house being so rude knocked it all the way down to a 2.  Pretty sad after I had given it a 4.5 on my last trip.

Decided to try out taylors for breakfast today. I started with the fresh squeezed orange juice. This is the pulpiest fresh orange juice I've ever had. It was great. Then my dish came out I ordered the Asian crab omelet. It was very good it came with crabmeat, green onions, avocado, and cheese. It was excellent all the ingredients seemed very fresh. This is a nice new find for breakfast in my area.

I have been going past this place wanting to try it for a while but never made it in until last night.  I ordered the sliders because it's called Chicago Hamburger Co for a reason.  I got two double's with cheese.  They were really good and just hit the spot.  I got an order of onion rings and a chocolate malt to go with them.  I love how this place has malts not too many places make them anymore.  This place is what it is a great burger place that is not for the health conscious people but hey they aren't trying to be.

Wow I really am glad Groupon guided me to this place.  I was a little worried after reading some reviews but pleasently surprised that the place didn't stink as one stated and that even though food was pricey it wasn't without merit.   For starters the bruschetta was great I am a huge fan of garlic and there was a lot of it.  After that came the dinner salad which had a creamy homemade Italian dressing on it which was just awesome they should bottle that stuff up and sell it at the front.  Finally my main course was Veal Lasagna yes that's right VEAL mmmmm.  It was full of flavor and the portion was just right.    After all this I still had to try a dessert so I went with raspberry sorbet dipped in dark chocolate.  It was a nice refreshing way to end the meal.    This place would be a five star if it wasn't for the a/c pumping the whole time when it wasn't needed.  Other than that I loved it and will totally go back.  It was one of the better Italian places I have been to in the valley for food.

So after an uneventful  trip to Honey Bears the previous week I decided to try out Hap's.  It is just as close to my house and the reviews were pretty decent so I wanted to try for myself.    I got the Brisket sandwich which was actually really good.  The sauce was dripping out the sides all nice and messy like a BBQ sandwich should be.  It was a tangy and sweet sauce with nice flavor.  The brisket was chopped into nice pieces so every bite you weren't ripping it apart.  I also had corn bread as my side.  It was decent sweet and crumbly like it should be.    Overall I think I have made the switch I still have to try out Stacey's but Hap's is quality and they have a great menu even including lamb.

I finally got a chance to check out this Diners Drive-In and Dives spot.  I am glad I did as the food was good and they serve posole  on a daily basis.    I got the posole and a shrimp ceviche tostada.  The tostada was great nice and thick to hold up with the ceviche on it and not get soggy fast.  The flavor was great and there was plenty of shrimp.  The posole was good not as spicy as I like but that was fixed with some Tapatio sauce and then it was great.    If you are in the area I recommend this place and I will be back for sure to try the tacos eveyone is raving about in their reviews.

Native wings rock they are one of my favorite places in the valley as they have a great variety and always are great.  Last night I went to go watch the BCS Championship game and get some wings and they had a pizza special $6.99 for a 14" cheese pie so we got that too.  All the food was great and the game was on every tv along with ample volume.  Overall a great time and great food.  Thanks Native

I finally made it to Nello's and am so happy I did.  Laura A. called and said she was craving pizza and since I'm the pizza addict anytime this rare occasion happens I am down in a heartbeat to go.  So since she lives in Mesa we decided to check out Nello's as the reviews were all top notch.    Upon arrival we were greated and we said we were ordering a to go order so we were shown the to go window.  Brian greeted us there after giving us a brief minute to scope out the wonderful menu.  We decided to get two 10" pies to get a good trial run at this place.  He was very nice and gave us some ideas and we went with The Murphy which has strips of bacon and onions on it and I got a custom pie with sun dried tomato's, gouda cheese, and green peppers.    When we got home we devoured both pies the sauce was great and we had one deep dish and one thin crust.  I preferred the deep dish but they both were great.    I will for sure be back for more pizza and to try their sandwich's as they sounded very good as well.  The service was great everyone was very nice it felt like a great neighborhood restaurant.  I think that feeling at a lot of restaurants has been lost today so it was very nice.    4.5/5

So I was craving Chicago deep dish pizza and I have never been to Old Chicago but I figured they have to know how to make a deep dish.  Well I was WRONG.  Yes it was technically deep dish but not Chicago style.  I ate just one piece which anyone who knows me that is nuts.  The sauce was just ok and the pizza didn't even make it to the top of the deep dish pan like a true Chicago deep dish would.  The crust wasn't flaky and it wasn't even layered right.  So yeah 2/5 from the pizza lover that has had "real" Chicago pizza (Giordano's, Lou Malnati's)

I love Barro's pizza but there are none by my house which is sad.  I was in the area so I stopped in for a pie and decided to try something new.  I ordered the wing pizza which is wing sauce cheese and chicken and it was pretty good.  Barro's always has a great pie and if there was one by my house I would order delivery way too often and probably be 100lbs bigger.

Went to grab some sushi with Jared R. tonight.  He recommended this place from reading the reviews on here.  We started off with the miso soup which was pretty good.  Lots of Tofu and the broth had a nice flavor.  We both ordered some sake bombers to gulp down with our meal.    We got 5 rolls which were all really good.  The first set was the yellowfin roll and the fiery shrimp.  They both were really good.  The fiery shrimp was exactly as the name said.  It had just the perfect amount of kick and shrimp.    The next roll to come out was the Tsunami Roll which was my favorite.  It had a fried outside and lots of flavor.  The sauce that came on the plate was more than just a decoration.    Lastly we had the big and spicy roll and the spicy tuna roll.  They both had a great amount of kick.  The big and spicy was very good and the best part was the pickled jalapenos on the top.    Overall this place was really good and I would totally go back again.  Thanks again for another good find Yelp.com

Went for lunch after reading the reviews on here.  I wasn't as amazed as most people I guess but the food was pretty good.  I started out with a Montana Margarita which was a margarita with huckleberries in it and huckleberry flavoring.  It was very good and very strong which I was happy about.  The chips and salsa came and the hot salsa was pretty good.  I ordered the crab and shrimp enchiladas and people weren't kidding about the portion size.  I barely got 2/3's of it down before I felt my stomach stretching in pain.  I was very happy that the rice and beans were actually edible not just there for taking up space.  Most places I have been to lately the rice and beans were just not edible.  The location was very nice and clean inside and had a tv with football on in the bar area.  The outdoor seating area looked very nice and the menu was full of stuff I wanted to come back for.  Especially the banana nut flan.

Tami is awesome!!!! I went in today for my second tattoo by her and she did a terrific job.  This shop is clean and the other artists working there are always courteous and nice. I am going back in 2 weeks to get a touch-up and some more added to the first tattoo Tami did for me.  I highly recommend this place as I know a couple others who have went to Tami and came out very happy.

This location is so much bigger than the Camelback location I think I will be changing to this one from now on.    As always the food is great I went with a couple friends and we ordered the tapas menu and had like 11 things highlights were: bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates calypso chips tortilla espanola ceviche and the mojito mmmmmmm  The service was great.  If you've never been it's a great spot to try out

First I want to state that they have changed their concept and menu so don't listen to old reviews as it's not the same restaurant.  I really liked this place the view was amazing and valet was free.  This being said yes it's pricey but you get what you pay for and that's local ingredients.  Their concept now supports local farms and farms in California that are organic.    I had a glass of Louis Martini Cab to go with my meal and it was wonderful.  I ordered the pork belly and was a little hesitant because it was combined with pear and I wasn't sure that would go well together.  I was very glad my server recommended it because it was some of the best pork belly I've ever had.    Our server Laura Carrol was very nice and always on top of our needs.  She made the dining experience top notch.  She was also very knowledgeable of the menu and if she didn't know the answer she went to ask the chef.    I will totally come back and I will again look for a groupon because it helps on the hit to the wallet.

Stopped in on the way to work for a breakfast burrito.  I ordered the Machaca and Egg burrito and while it was ok about halfway through the grease started to soak through so much the filling was falling out of the bottom of the tortilla.  At that point I just was kinda grossed out and threw out the rest of the burrito.  Luckily it was a huge burrito so I had my fill on by that point anyways.  Doubt I'll go back when I know Filiberto's isn't too far away.

So far this is my favorite BBQ place I have been in the valley.  I stayed away from the pulled pork as I read in many reviews this was a bad meal.    I ordered the ribs a half slab which had two sides the beer battered fries which were really good and the bbq beans which were the highlight of the meal.  They were full of flavor and I wanted more.  The ribs were really good I enjoyed the sauce.    If you are looking for a good BBQ spot this is a great one to try out just for most it may be a journey of a drive luckily I work close.

Great cleaners I have never had an issue with any of my clothes.   Prices are a bit more than some of your cheap cleaners but the quality of work is much better.  Stains have always been removed and clothes have always been returned on time.

Mr. Goodcents is a great alternative to Subway.  They have more ingredient options and a few locations around the valley.    I ordered the Italian sub with Capicola, Pepperoni, and Salami.  They have Asiago bread so I got it on that.  The vegetables are very fresh and the sandwich was great.    For the $5 footlong lovers they have 8 subs on that menu and if you want a different one it's only .49 extra.  They also have many sub size even 8 inch so if 6 is too small but 12 is too large have an option.    If you've never been check it out you won't be disappointed.

So yesterday we had a going away luncheon for a coworker who is leaving today and we all went to Macayo's for lunch.  We had a group of 20 people so sometimes this can be a challenge but we called ahead and they said they would take care of us no problem.  So we arrive and the tables are all setup and everything started out great all the drink orders and getting us situated.    We were checking out the new summer menu and a group of us decided to try the habenero lime hot wings.  So they brought them out and no habenero sauce on them what so ever.  I asked about this to our server and he said habenero is sweet and it's on there.  LOL WOOOOOOOOOW I couldn't believe this guy just said this it is one of the hottest peppers on earth.  He said well other people like them so not sure what to say other than I can bring buffalo sauce.  LOL   Next came main courses a coworker next to me had her order totally wrong twice before the 3rd time it was finally right.  My street tacos were tiny and more of an appitizer than a entree like they were listed.    So overall this will be my last trip to Macayo's and hopefully my review saves some people from a meal that they regret.

I went today for lunch and was happy I went.  I had the Double Ortega burger with green chili's, grilled onions, and thousand island.  The fries could have been a bit more well done to my liking but were ok.    I really wish I had some quarters cause they had some classic arcade games like the original Galaga and an old NFL Blitz.  Overall good place as long as you can get past the look of the building from the outside.

Went today for lunch on the my friend and I's Burger Tour of Phoenix.  I actually regret it.  The food was not great.  I got the Q Burger which comes with green chili and swiss.  I thought it sounded good but NOPE.  The green chili was really dry and unflavorful.  The onions overpowered the green chili which was a major problem.  The fries tasted like they were frozen in a bag then fried.    For just drinks maybe you can go here on a budget and I guess have fun but I would say you would have to be a redneck to do that.  They have dead animals all over and on tv there was tractor pulls on.

Wendy's new burgers are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better.  I love the thicker cut and the new butter buns.  That sounded dirty but seriously they are a night and day difference.  Pair that with the seasalt fries and for fast food you got a nice meal.  I will for sure be back.    oh and p.s. the caramel apple parfait frosty is good but it's really small compared to what you think you may be getting and for the price it's not worth it in my opinion.

Went for lunch and wasn't impressed.  I had the double sonic burger with bacon.  The fries were just mediocre and the burger really wasn't anything impressive either.  The only thing that gave this review a second star was the Cherry Limeade.  Honestly a great drink too bad the food couldn't be on par.

I went today for lunch and WOW I can't say how great this place was.  Ok you do have to get past the fact it's not the best looking location or even in the best area but this place is a must experience.  I got the Mexican Burger which came with grilled onions, mayo, monterry jack cheese, and green chili's.  I tried a fry first and was amazed I usually don't like the bigger cut fries cause they are never crispy enough but no these fries were the best I've had in a long time.  They came with seasoned salt on them and were just amazing.  I had a milkshake with m&m's which was amazing as well.  I can't say enough about how good this place is.  If you have never went as I never had you need to go NOW.

I was craving Chinese for lunch at work and a friend and I went at the recommendation of another coworker to try this place out.  The business was clean and service was good.  The value was good as well as I had the lunch special which came with Egg Drop Soup which was the best item I had, Rice, Crab Puff, Egg Roll (pretty bad one), and my entree which was the twice cooked chicken.  All I can say of my entree was HOLY SALT.  I think they put a whole jar of MSG in there.  I did try my friends dish and it was decent, but overall nothing I will make a trip back for.

So from the outside this place doesn't look to appetizing but get past that and check it out.  I have been on a ceviche kick lately and I stopped in to cure a taco kick and ended up getting a great ceviche tostada.  The menu has many south of the border options for street tacos (real tacos).  The price was great as well.  This place is a must if you like street tacos or ceviche also they serve 7 seas soup which is amazing.  Check it out if you haven't been.

Last night I was craving something to eat and since it was 9pm on a Monday not too many options to choose from, but I was excited to see that Tacos Jalisco was open so I headed down for some late night grub.    I ordered the Chile Rellano plate which is two Chile Rellano's and rice and beans.  The food was great but very tough to eat with plastic silverware.  Next time i get these I'll just order to go.    They have Coca Cola in the bottle which to me is always a plus cause it is so much better than American Coca Cola.  So ya check this place out if you are in the area

Normally I would rate Dos a 3 or better but last night I had a really bad experience.  For starters as me and my friend walk in the door guy says "Are you sure you both are 21?"  UM yeah I am almost 30 and my buddy just turned 30.  So after showing our ID's we go in and grab some beers.  The selection is ok mostly mexican beers which are fine but you better be ready to go pee about 50 times while drinking them.  On one of my trips to the bathroom I get stopped by the same door guy who says "I was told you need to be escorted out. "  I am totally confused as I am not even buzzed and didn't do anything wrong.  So he says "Someone says you were swerving as you were walking".  WHAT??????  I am not driving for one and for two I am able to walk perfectly fine.  I walk a line for him and say see obviously not drunk.  He tells me "Ya you seem ok so go ahead and stay"  Like it's a privilege or something.  So I go and get my buddy and we headed next door to Whitehouse which was a great decision.

Kazimierz is a hidden gem in old town.    I have been several times and every time it's been a great experience.  The atmosphere is great it's dark and there are couches to sit at and be comfortable.    The food and wine are excellent and there are many options for both.  They have a huge selection of by the bottle wine for all price ranges and also you can buy a good selection by the glass.

Yay a new place to add to my list of good grub and a menu that makes me want to come back several times to try out more.  My girlfriend and I went for dinner last night and had a great meal.  She got the chile rellano plate and I got a filet salad.  Yes I know I just said salad but it had filet mignon on it and jalapeno bacon.  I mean come on it's not healthy especially with the chipotle ranch dressing on it.  It was just what I needed.  I had a bite of the chile rellano and I thought they were good as well.    Like I said there were many other things on the menu that I for sure want to try so I will be back and hopefully soon.

Well I can honestly see why this place is all over Groupon these days.  Upon arrival there was 2 people inside at 7pm on a Thursday yes 2 people.  That actually started to scare me but whatever my Groupon was going to expire so I had to use it.  So I grabbed a window seat and was greated by a server who was very nice and asked if I was using the Groupon which I stated yes and he quickly brought out the pitcher of Sangria.  The Sangria was very different then others I've had before as it had peppermint schnapps in it odd but it worked and was tasty.  I then ordered the Cordero Asado which is lamb and sun dried tomato's in olive oil.  It was just ok not bad but not great either.  I also ordered a paella de pescado y marisco which was very bland and the seafood tasted previously frozen and essentially flavorless.  I was pretty disappointed as the regular price on this dish was $32 I can't imagine paying that for what I got.  So on to the last entree which was a dry aged steak and shrimp.  The steak had been frozen and also was flavorless and the shrimp were as well.  During the meal I was just looking around inside and just kept thinking what if Gordon Ramsey could come here on Kitchen Nightmares and fix this place.  Maybe the owner will try that to revitalize the place instead of getting people in the door with Groupon.    Cliff Note: Don't buy the Groupon you will regret it.  Just go to Tapas Papa Frita instead :)

My favorite pizza place in AZ.  I got my usual sun dried tomato and cheese pizza.  As always it was great.  They cook your pizza in a brick oven with coal so you get a nice smoky flavor on the crust.  This place is amazing if you haven't been you gotta go.

Wow why have I lived here 6 years and never been to this place let alone why has nobody informed me that I must go????  This place is straight outta New York food quality is awesome and I love the attitude of the staff.  I totally recommend making reservations because this place is packed and for a good reason.     I went with a party of 7 and we got seated and our drink orders were taken I had a glass of Pinot Noir which was very good and went excellent with the fried calamari I had.  They say award winning calamari and I see why I honestly don't like calamari usually but I went to town on this stuff.  The marinara sauce is spicy and full of flavor just an amazing way to start a meal.  For my entree I got the Chicken Cutlet Parmigiana which was awesome.  I have to thank the yelpers for the suggestion on that one they were all right it was fried to perfection and the pasta and sauce on the side was excellent.    I wish I had room for dessert as I am sure they are good but my wallet and stomach had enough for the evening so I will have to venture back again very soon.    This place is expensive but worth it and it's nice to have a true Italian place to go to that isn't cookie cutter Bucca or others.

I am so grateful I bought the groupon for Razz's and I got to experience this place.  This is such a great spot and I totally wish I had found it earlier.    For appetizer I had the crab and lobster stuffed squash blossom which was actually two of them and it was laid over a yellow curry sauce.  They were very good had me excited for the meal to come.    I ordered the beef short ribs as my main course paired it with the Hahn Meritage Red which went perfectly together.  The short rib was cooked perfectly it was pretty much melting as my fork was cutting through it.  The potato's that it was sitting on soaked up the red wine sauce on the plate and made for the perfect bite.    I would have loved to have dessert but after all I had ate I was stuffed so I can't say if anything was good or not but the menu looked great there were several options I wanted to try.    Overall this place is great I will sit at the Chef's table next time and if you go on the website there is a coupon for buy one get one free entree during the weeknights which can help out on the bill.

After looking at the menu and having a groupon burning in my pocket I was pretty excited to try out Remington's Restaurant.  Unfortunately that's as far as the excitement went as far as dining experience went.   Pro's: Location  Con's: Fly landing on bread bowl Host's dressed like morgue workers Food comes out with plastic dome's over it to keep warm but really wasn't too warm anyways Felt very dated inside  Server pointed out total before groupon like I was going to stiff him on tip   Overall I will not be back and wasn't impressed at all.  I guess if you are staying at the resort it's not a bad choice but I'd still go for a quick drive to one of the many other fine establishments within a short distance.

So I had a Groupon that led me to Cove Trattoria and I am very greatful.  Jason B. and I went for dinner on my final day of the Groupon and had a great meal.  After sitting down our waitress Aubree came over to drop off menu's and waters.  We asked her recommendation on the menu and she gave us a few options on each part of the menu which was great it wasn't just one thing.    We ordered the: GARLIC VERDE SHRIMP GARLIC MARINATED SHRIMP WITH A ROASTED SUN-DRIED TOMATO PESTO SAUCE  and: SHRIMP PIZZA SHRIMP, PESTO MOZZARELLA AND TOMATO VODKA CREAM SAUCE   Both items were awesome and I wish I had room for dessert because they have Nutella pizza mmmmmmm it looked awesome.  We had great service from Aubree and she told us the history of the place which was cool.    I will be back for sure to try more items and more pizza.

I have been to Persian Room several times and every time I leave happy and full and even better with leftovers.  I had the Chicken Sultani with the loobia polo rice upgrade.  I usually do the Beef Sultani but just changed it up.  It was very good and with the lunch entree it is the same size and a few dollars cheaper.  For Persian food in Phoenix this is the best place I have been to.

Oh how I love pitchers of Kiltlifter in the evening.  =)   I went last night with a buddy to Four Peaks for dinner and my favorite beverage. We had a table outside as it was pretty busy.  I ordered a chef special which was a pork tenderloin with a chipotle cream sauce.  It was filling and had decent flavor.  The beer however stole the show as always.    Four Peaks has a great atmosphere and AMAZING beer it's always worth a trip and if you are a fan on facebook they put their lunch and dinner specials on daily so you can plan the right time to visit.

***************Hidden Gem Alert****************************  So I totally don't want to review this place because it is a hidden gem. The food I tasted last night was great.  I started with prosciutto wrapped asparagus which was good had some balsamic and oil that they were sitting on to add to the flavor.  I mean anything wrapped with prosciutto or bacon is an A+ in my book.    On to the pizza Jared R. and I went.  We shared the Diavola pizza which was house made sausage, pepperoni, jalapenos, and crushed red pepper.  The pie is made in the brick oven that you can see which is cool.  It is a thin crust pie and the outside crust comes out nice and crispy.  I see a few write that they compare it to Bianco's and I would have to agree that it is on that elite level of pizza.    I had a couple glasses of Frenzy wine which was a Sav Blanc and very tasty.  The drink menu looks great lot's of items I wanted to try but on a Thursday night it was hard to consider them.    I will be back very often as pizza is my favorite and these guys do it right.  So make the trip and discover the great food they put out.

I honestly don't get the love of this place it was good BBQ but far from great.    Tip: If your pulled pork or chicken sandwich comes smothered in sauce it's because they are hiding something.    A true bbq place would put sauce on the side so you can taste the smokiness of the meat before drenching it in sauce.    Now the sauce was good and chicken was tender on my sandwich and the bbq beans were great but I just would like to try the smokey meat before to taste how good it is and how juicy it is prior to sauce.    Will I go back maybe but for sure I won't go out of my way there are too many other places in town that offer above average bbq.

Ok let me start this by saying it was only $55 for a night.  So for a place to crash this is an ok hotel the suite was 450 sq ft.  had a microwave, fridge, and a coffee maker.    Overall the hotel looked ok but there were some shady people walking around and I put my car right by front doors so it was watched and under lights all night.    There was some construction going on and at 8am jackhammers and such were going off.  Not the alarm you want when you got in at 4am from the bar.    So the shower was nice kitchen was cheap and old couch was nice bedroom tv nice other one not so much.  Bed was good enough and the fireplace in bedroom was for display no fire which was kinda lame.    I don't know that I would ever stay here again but it was cheap and right across street from Hard Rock which is where I was for the evening so it worked.

I've been to Chase several times and it's a nice park.  Last night however I sat in the Club reserved level.  The seats are nice but you are never in them.  I was at the Club level bar and then the Arizona Baseball Club area.  They are a lot of fun and add to a unique baseball experience.  Great food and a great selection of alcohol.  I don't think I can ever go back to "normal" seats again.

I stopped in for lunch today with Laura A. and had a good meal.  We got there right around 11am when they opened so there wasn't much of a crowd.  I wasn't hungry for the full entrees so I went with the tinga tacos which are one of my fav's.  They were pretty good and I couldn't finish all 4 of them with the fries so I would say for the price they were worth it.  I read many people say this place is over priced but if you look at the portions and quality of the meal I would say you are wrong.  If you want a cheap good meal then there are many places for that this is for a nice meal with lot's of flavor and variants over tradition.  As I was reading through the menu options I saw things that you can't get at most Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix but some things you can and yes they may be cheaper at other places.  So just plan ahead eat something special here and enjoy it.  This is one place I will sure be back to for dinner and some more of that yummy homemade horchata.

My friend had her birthday dinner last night at Sapporo.  We sat at the teppanyaki table which is always a bunch of fun.  Our chef was great cracking jokes the whole time and making everyone laugh.    I ordered my usual sake and Kirin to wash down my food and to eat I had the Chilean Sea Bass (which I found out today is not actually bass or Chilean) and Filet Mignon.  The fish was amazing.  Cooked perfectly and amazing flavor.  I honestly didn't even want my filet after eating it because it was that good.    Thanks for another fun filled evening with great food Sapporo.

Mesa Grill fully met my expectations and then some.  I had always wanted to go try Bobby Flay's restaurant as I watch wayyyyyy too much food network tv.  So last weekend in Vegas I got the chance and was so glad I did.    #1 rule make reservations just trust me  I ate the Rabbit and yes it was amazing served on bone and off so you get best of both worlds there.    Jalapeno margarita was awesome but not on menu.  Thank you Mr. Bartender for hooking up the request.

Stopped in tonight after my soccer game for a beer and a bite.  I really enjoyed the styling of the place nice patio for outdoor dining and a cool inside dining area with blue accent lights.  Started out with their huge beer menu and got a basket of fries.  The fries come out in a mini shopping cart which was pretty cool.  Right before we start to eat Bob Saggat and Frankie Muniz came in.  Figured I had came to the right spot for a burger now.  Sure enough the food was amazing.  I'm glad I stopped in and for sure will be back again.

So I have been many times and haven't wrote a review so here it goes.  Chino Bandido is ultimate Mexican-Asian fusion with a twist of Caribbean in it.  They have many amazing dishes there I can't say which one I like best.  Plus you get a snickerdoodle cookie with every meal.    Today I had the machaca and pork fried rice.  The machaca was great not too dry and full of flavor.  The fried rice was very good as well and with the hot sauce they have is nice and spicy.    If you haven't been to Chino you are missing out.

Echo Canyon is a fun hike and the views are amazing.  I like to go at night because you get to see amazing sunsets from the summit plus there are less people on the trail compared to early mornings.    This hike isn't for the weak by any means it's a tough hike but not insane by any means.  There are plenty of places to stop for breaks and just make sure you bring plenty of water as you will need it.   If you've never been on this hike I say for sure try it out you will love it.  Just make sure you have some good shoes with you so you don't roll your ankles.

Wow imagine this another 5 star review for Fez.  I had been wanting to try this place out after so many people telling me how great it was on here and offline.  So yesterday afternoon I decided that it was time.  When arriving to Fez I really liked how the building was setup very cool decor and felt very open.  So we got a window seat and order a round of beer to start off.  They have Kona on tap so I was happy already.  For the meal we ordered the shrimp kisra which is like a flatbread with a pile of awesomeness on it.  Then we got the tan-tan chicken sandwich which is a panko breaded chicken breast with olives, and baba ganoush spread.  It was really good as well.  I saw many other things on the menu I wanted to try including the creme brulee which changes flavors daily.  I also want to try the sweet potato fries but I was just too full this trip.  The food was excellent so I know I will be back soon to eat here again.

I was really looking forward to getting pizza from here as I've had it before and it was good.  So after looking at the menu I decided on a pie with two toppings sun-dried tomato's and hatch green chili's.  I ordered around 730pm and figured about a 30-40 minute wait.  At 840pm still had no pizza so I called and asked what the issue was.  Just then the driver called and asked for directions to my house.  I got the pie close to 9pm and the Pepsi was not really cold and the pie was far from hot.  So based on this experience a two star review because the pizza was good but for bad delivery and high cost for the poor service.

Solid pizza and my favorite in Phoenix by a landslide.  Last night went for a work dinner and showed a few newbie Patsy eaters what real pizza should taste like.   We had two pies one pesto and one regular and both were simply amazing like always.  I recommend always adding sun dried tomatoes to a pie it really adds to the sauce.    This location is great as well especially now with the holiday season they have lights up everywhere and it's just a nice experience.

Yelp leads me to another hot spot.    1st course: Sizzlin'  Peppers: Jalapenos stuffed with panela cheese, goat cheese and Menonita cheese  So good yet so simple.  The variety of cheeses were great flavor to the grilled jalapeno.  2nd course: Sergio's Pork Tenderloin: Chocolate-espresso rubbed served with vegetables and roasted potatoes. Finished with a vanilla bean serrano butter sauce  This was due to the high reviews from other yelpers and I thank you because it was amazing.  The sauce was great and complimented the veggies and pork so well.  The tenderloin was cooked perfectly fork tender and the chocolate-espresso rub was a nice flavor.  3rd course: Croissant Bread Pudding Jack Daniels whiskey lime / caramel sauce  I was looking for a reason to be full and not order dessert but one specific review was just due to this dessert so I had to try it.  It was a different twist to bread pudding due to the pastry vs. soaked bread but it was tender and tasted wonderful.  I totally recommend it.    Overall Sierra Bonita grill was a great restaurant and I will totally be coming back for happy hour as they have appetizer discounts and drink specials.

Today our boss took our department out for lunch at l&l. There are many great looking items on the menu I had a hard time choosing. There was however one that stuck out from a triple d episode. I ordered the loco moco and it was darn good. It's a bed of rice with a ground beef patty on top with 2 over easy eggs and gravy above that. On first bite you pop the egg open over the meat and rice and just get this layered goodness. It was a great lunch. I totally want to go back to try their other items but at least this one was great.

I went for pre-Thanksgiving dinner.  They had a special menu with a tamale, carne asada, and an enchilada with rice and beans for $9.95.  Also sangria's were only $4.  WOW the food was delicious I wish they had this on the menu every night I'd even pay more for it.  The sangria was ok but the food was definitely a hit. The menu looked pretty good so I'll probably come back.

Started off with the Kiwi Chard sangria which was excellent.  I ordered my favorite the Posole mmmmmmm so yummy.  It has cabbage, radishes, pork, and hominy and the broth is a chili lime and it's just great.  I then had the chili ceaser salad which was pretty good.  The dressing was spiced up just enough.

Last night Laura A. and I went to dinner at Ticoz for Valentines Day.  They had a special menu which was a 4 course meal and they offered a wine pairing as well.    We started with a appetizer plate that had Guacummus, Calamari, and lettuce wraps.  I love their guacummus it's full of flavor and a perfect blend of two great things.  The lettuce wraps are very good as well very unique with chicken fruit and nuts in them.   Next course was the salads she got the mixed greens and I went with the Latin Passion which comes with Baby spinach, field green mix, jack cheese, corn, tomato, pinto bean, cilantro, green onion, crispy tortilla strip, and a tropical spicy dressing.  The salad was awesome but also filling which was going to be a problem as I haven't even got to my main course.    So for the main courses she got the New York strip with chimichurri and grilled shrimp.  They were good and the steak was very good.  I went with the chipotle chicken which was good but lacking that chipotle flavor I was hoping for.    Lastly we got our dessert to go because we were both just stuffed.  We got the empenada which was great a few hours later.    We washed down our meal with Laura getting a glass of temperinillo and I had a lychee mojito and it was sooooooooo good.    Ticoz is a great spot to chill and have a nice meal I totally recommend it they have a ton of great items on the menu and great drinks to wash them down with.

Went back to Ticoz on Monday night and had a terrific experience.  I honestly really love this place.  The atmosphere is great and the food never let's you down.  This night I had the New York steak with chimichurri on it.  To wash it down I had a Lychee mojito which I have never seen anywhere else.  There drink menu is extensive with flavor options which make it really fun even if you are just out for cocktails.

I went with a group last night for dinner to try Cucina Tagliani and well it just wasn't my cup of tea.    I love Italian food don't get me wrong and I love big portions both of which Cucina Tagliani offers.  The service was great as well.    My problem was the food just wasn't really good.  I had the calamari which was ok and a ceaser salad which again just ok.  Then for main course i had the veal parmigiana which I thought just really lacked in flavor and thought the meat was over done.    So overall it wasn't a bad experience just lack of tasty food that led to the low rating so try at your own risk.

Went Friday night for a late dinner and was pleasantly surprised with their green chili burger.  I have had the pizza and love the cheese with fresno chili's on it.  I was just craving something different.  The menu said they were rated best burgers in Phoenix this year and I do admit they are up there on my list.   I highly recommend stopping in if you never have before or try the burger if you've never done so.

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW that's the one word that sums up my experience at Deseo.    Saturday night for a friend's bday dinner and restaurant week I went with about 8 people and we had a private room.    For starters I had the chicken posole which had jidori chicken, avocado, tepin salsa and hominy.  I had never had chicken posole before usually always pork but this was really good.  I finished my bowl and actually was craving more.    Second course was the shrimp chicharron with aji amarillo, endive, and pickled jalapenos.  It was almost the texture of popcorn shrimp but oh sooooo much yummier.    Entree course I had the loup de mer al huacatay which was a sea bass on top of crab and asparagus pionono, ajillo, and bitter orange.  Wow it was so delectable.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented it perfectly.  It was nice to get down to the bed of crab and asparagus that it was sitting on.    Dessert course was the chocolate cigar.  Such a great dessert.  It was very pleasing to the eye and tasted just as good.   The cappuccino gelato was a great compliment to the chocolate cigar.  I loved how even the matchbook was edible.    Overall such an amazing dinner one of my favorite meals I have ate in Phoenix and I can't wait to go back to try more of their amazing food.

After a long day in the sun it was time to cool off and grab some lunch.  I went to Tradiciones and am very glad I did.  The food was amazing.  I had the pollo en mole and it was very good spicy yet sweet.  After dinner I had the tres leches cake which was also very yummy.  To wash all this down I had the millionaires margarita and it was very potent.  It had grand marnier, tequila, and Chambord.  Overall the meal was great and I will keep this on my list of favorite mexican places to eat in Arizona.

I am totally in love with the Oolong Sea Bass.  I had it at another location and was blown away and so I was expecting it to be a one off but I ate it last night at this location and it was almost the same perfection.    This location is a little more busy with younger crowd than I like but it is close to my house so I went.  The patio is right off mill so if you are looking for a nice dinner I suggest eating indoors.  If you just want to chill have some drinks then outside is great.    Our server was nice but seemed nervous as she dropped several items which added to some humor in the evening.  Overall we had a great dinner and dessert.

Halloween night I went to the joint for the Swedish House Mafia show and was pleasantly surprised with guest DJ's dropping in on the action.  First Kaskade then Tiesto and finally Dirty South.  What a show with the only billed DJ's being Swedish House Mafia.  Gotta love Vegas that's all I can say.    I got VIP tickets which meant Open Bar and Balcony seating.  This was great as drinks are pricey and I got a great view of the show.  After some drinks I had to go dance though so I went downstairs and was told I can only be in VIP area and I said I'd take my bracelet off they wouldn't let me.  So I hopped the rope and went to go dance.  The sound was great and I couldn't have asked for a better time on Halloween.

AMAZING CURRY!!!!!  I went for lunch and was very impressed.  They have a huge selection vegetarian and not and all priced very well.  I got the Red Curry Chicken with a Thai egg roll, rice and fried wonton for $6.95 what a steal.  You can get as hot as you like which I like a lot of spice in my life and they delivered.    I will be back for sure in the near future and I am kicking myself for taking this long to try it.  Also after reading reviews I saw the service was bad and I had no issues with service they were very prompt and even refilled my soda without even having to ask.

So I am really at a loss for the how the reviews for this place are any good.  I went due to a snag and save deal I got online and am grateful for it because I still spent too much money.  First I got a salad and it had stale croutons and really no flavor.  Then came the pizza.  I got the Boarder Runner pie and it had premade crust and just generic low quality toppings.  I just don't get the idea of the restaurant and really wish they cared more about the product they put on the table.

We came here looking for something different for lunch close to work.   It's a walk up and order then grab a table. The person taking orders was nice and fast.   I ordered the clam and white wine sauce. This was a big mistake as clams seemed canned and sauce wasn't on point. The noodles weren't the right choice either as they seemed over done.   For Italian food this wouldn't be a recommendation from me in the area.

Ah how I love lazy Sunday's at the Vig.  After watching the soccer match we had a nice buzz so we needed a place to continue the great day so we decided to head a couple blocks up the street to the Vig.  We sat outside on the patio which was nice warm but the misters made it very comfortable.    We got the crab artichoke dip to share and all started with $3 Peroni's that were on special.  The dip is always great.  Very good flavor lot's of crab meet and the little chips that they give you to dip are amazing.    After a couple rounds of beer we decided to take advantage of the half off bottles of wine.  We ordered two bottles and just chilled for a few hours enjoying a lazy Sunday funday.

Popped in for Sunday brunch and had the hangover helper which is exactly what I needed.  It is chilaquiles rojos, with scrambled eggs, carne asada, red salsa, tortilla chips, queso cotija, sour cream and pico de gallo and a over easy egg on the top.  Man it was spot on and I instantly felt better however suddenly I wanted a nap.  I was glad all worked out because I tried to go to Over Easy and Matt's Big Breakfast and the lines were huge so obviously it was meant to be.

Wow this place is awesome.  Thank you Groupon for sending me this way.    So it was a little hard to find as it's tucked away down a side street with not much signage.  Don't let that fool you though this place is a MUST stop.    I ordered the special which was a southwestern meatloaf wrapped in bacon with green chili and pepper jack cheese in it.  It was really good I am glad I ordered the meatloaf.   I usually would never order that as usually it's not my favorite thing.    The meal came with two sides so I went with the jalapeno creamed corn which was to die for.  It was spicy and sweet and just awesome.  My other side was the green chili cornbread casserole.  It was good nothing great but it had a nice kick with the green chili in it.    On to dessert well actually not on to dessert I was too full which was a good thing.  I will be back for dessert another day for sure probably for happy hour because the menu looked great.  They have distinct lunch, happy hour, and dinner menu's so you can go different times of the day and have totally different meals.    Totally awesome spot to try if you have never been I give it 4.5/5

Oh how I love Fuego Bistro this place is top notch.  They even opened up another room for more indoor seating.    I ordered the Pernil Asado which is my favorite and their signature dish.  It is slow roasted suceulent pork served with an orange habanero mojo and local corn tortillas.  The pork seriously melts in your mouth and with the sauce I can't get enough of it.    For the two sides that go with it I love the Jalapeno Creamed Corn which is actually perfectly spicy and yummy.  I also got the Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes which are very good as well.    The Mojito's are a must have I usually can't go without at least two and they have many flavors to choose from I really like the Blood Orange flavor.    The best part is they usually have groupon's which make it very cost effective.

Had a great day at the Mariners game today.  There are tons of great places to eat with everything from Gyros to Funnel Cakes.  They also have a great beer selection with many premium beers on draft and in big bottles.  My favorite part of the stadium is the huge lawn area.  For $6 you get a great spot in the outfield lawn and watch the game perfectly.  It's my favorite park and luckily for me my favorite team plays in it.

Finally I made it to the chymist for Seahawk Sunday. I was greated with 3 dollar pints and a great appitizer special. I had wings and potato skins. I got whisky BBQ and spicy wings which were both really good. The skins were good as well.   I'm really happy we have a Seahawks bar here in Arizona to go to watch the games every Sunday.

Went last night for the Seahawks draft party and Sounders FC game.  There was a pretty good turnout.    I ordered just an appetizer and some Blue Moon's as I was going to eat dinner later.  I got the southwest corn bruschetta and it was pretty good.  The bread was nicely toasted and the corn and black bean topping was really nice.    I can't wait for the football season to start to head back again.

Oh how I love in n out burger.  I try to rarely go due to the high health content of their food and the fact that I no longer live in a state without one.  I do enjoy animal style fries and animal style burgers though.  For a fast food burger place this is one of the best.

Today at lunch I had the chicken tostada and it was great. I got it this green tomatillo ranch that was great. This place is a great spot for tacos, burritos, and enchiladas. The only knock I had was that it seems they are a little skimpy on the meat and heavy on the beans.  They make their tortillas from scratch in 3 varieties. For dessert I also got this amazing coconut caramel flan I totally recommend it if your a coconut fan.    If you haven't been here yet make the trip it's worth it.

I just finished my BSIT degree.  I would not recommend U of P to anyone looking at learning something.  If you already have the experience and just need the degree like I did it is ok.  I still was frustrated spending $1200 a class for not learning anything.  The best classes I had were the general education classes.  My IT classes were poorly thought up and had horrible content.  One example is that a teacher was showing us the inside of a computer and didn't even know where the CMOS battery was.  I know I'm a geek for knowing where to non IT people but this is a major problem.    I have had a few friends go here as well and all have the same problems.  Many of the team learning assignments are challenging because the other group members are just looking to take up space and get your good grade.  You will fail based on your other members if you don't do their work.  So it's just a mess.  I am glad to be able to have a degree though which is why they have 2 stars not 1.  Just do yourself a favor go to a real school get a real education and be happy.  :)

Went today on my weekly burger fix and I have to say this place rocks.  The steak burger was amazing I had a double California style with 1000 island and cheese.  Very yummy burger and then they have these shoestring fries to go with it AMAZING.  I recommend getting the honey mustard to dip them in.  I didn't try the frozen custard as I was full from lunch but I will be back for that.    Freddy's you have earned yourself a repeat customer.

Wow how wrong could a reccomendation have been to try this place.  I heard about good pizza and good wings so I decided to check it out.  I ordered the New Yorker pizza and the "killer" boneless wings.  First of all the total for that and soda was over $30 which is rediculous but if it was amazing ok fine I'll deal.  Well the pizza was very underwhelming and the toppings were just laid on not even cooked into the pizza.  The wings were far from killer hot barely even on the mild scale.  There was a huge lack of sauce.  Just overall I was not impressed and for sure will take my pizza and wing business elsewhere.

The tacos were too greasy the pizza was on cardboard and the wings kicked my a**.  If you like really hot wings this is the place to go.  Honestly they taste good too.  I have had lots of hot wings and love hot food but the extra hot at Zipps is INTENSE.  That would be the only reason I would so to go.

I love this place went today for lunch and had the pizza and salad combo for $9.00.  Great deal and you get bread with oil and vinegar for starters.  The pizza is wood fired thin crust and very yummy.  I usually get the cheese and sun dried tomato pizza and cesar salad and have never been disappointed.  They have Italian soda's too that are very tasty.  My favorite is the Very Chanilla.  Yes I spelled it right it's a Cherry Vanilla soda and after finishing one you want a second.  I have never ate here for dinner so I wouldn't know how it is but after eating lunch here many times I would totally recommend it.

I went back after a long break no real reason just haven't been back.  I had the usual lunch combo pizza and salad for $9.  I also got my favorite Italian Soda Very Chanilla.  As usual the food was very good and the service was good.  There was one thing I noticed that the usual bread with oil portion was smaller than normal.

Friday for lunch I went to Neapolitan and tried one of their new pizza's on the menu.  Neapolitan White Pizza which had Fresh garlic, fontina, mozzarella, gouda and roasted tomatoes topped with basil.  It was actually really good.  I am glad to see they are adding more options to their menu that is already great for lunch.

Absolutely love this place.  It's nice to go to a pub on the strip and actually feel like you are in a pub.  The non-stop go go go takes a back seat at this place and I feel more at home which on evening number 3 or so is a nice thing to have happen.    The food is great and they have great beers to satisfy your palate.  Also they have live music at night which always is nice to listen to while enjoying a pint and a bite.    I recommend the rack of lamb in curry it is just perfect to cut up into little lamb lollipops and enjoy.  MMMMMM.

Last night before the D-Backs and Cubs game I stopped in for what I thought were going to be cheaper beers before going into the game.  I was way wrong.  Actually I think it's cheaper to drink inside the park then this place.  The only good thing is it was full of Cubs fans so I was in good company.  I won't make the mistake of stopping here again.

Last night I went with my motorcycle club out to Joe's for dinner.  It was really out on a farm.  This place is very far but the experience was worth the drive.    I ordered the Fontina Burger that had roasted red peppers, grilled mushrooms, arugula, pesto, and fontina cheese.  The ingredients were fresh as they grow their own vegetables on the farm right there.  The fries that came with it were cooked well and very good as well.    There is room to eat inside at a community table or your own table and there is a huge area outside to eat on benches as well.  Overall it was a great experience and I will go back because there are several other things on the menu that looked very appetizing.

Always loved papa murphys and now I love them even more with the addition of sun dried tomatos. I'm pretty basic with my pizza usually just cheese cause it's rare to find sun dried tomatos. So I am really happy to have another reason to never eat frozen pizza unless papa murphys is closed.

Went for dinner tonight and had a good meal.  Atmosphere is nice and the food was good.  The portions were just a bit small for my liking.  I did love the variety of meat you could select from.  I had a Kobe burger with a chipotle aoli that was very good.  The sweet potato fries were very good as well.  If you are looking for a nice place to get a burger and chill this is a good spot to check out.

So I admit I am a food network junkie and I honestly only went to this place because I saw it on best I ever ate fried chicken episode but come on best I ever ate fried chicken in Phoenix I had to see for myself.    Well Mrs. White backed it up with some amazing chicken and I don't know what previous reviewers were talking about with the sides because my grandma from North Carolina was in town and her and I both liked the red beans and macaroni salad.    The staff was friendly and even sent me home with two extra pieces of chicken for later.  This place is awesome and I will for sure be a repeat customer.  Also whoever said KFC has chicken as good and it's cheaper well keep going back to KFC and stay outta places like this cause you don't belong.  Just sayin'.  KFC aint got nothin on Mrs. White.

One of the only places in town where you can get a Tinga Taco.  I love this little spot.  They have a wide variety of tequilas and also my favorite a pomegranate infused tequila.  So good.  If your looking for a place to go chill have some great food and drinks this is where to go.

HOLY HABENERO LIME MARGARITA.     So I decided to man up and try this thing out after thinking about it many of times.  It was just as I expected hot and amazing.  After I was almost done though I was finishing my last sips when it happened.  I got a seed right into the back of my throat that was the painful moment that kept me away from ordering this thing before.  I managed to pull through though and finished it.    I also got the 3 taco meal and the tacos were great I had tinga, lobster, and chorizo and papas.  The beans were horrible but the rice was ok so just order the tacos without sides and save yourself a bit of money.

Laura and I went in to Los Reyes de la Torta for lunch on our day off yesterday.  We were both really hungry as we hadn't ate all day and it was a good thing because I didn't even finish my plate.    I ordered the cantaloupe agua fresca and the tinga quesadilla.  The agua fresca was awesome full of flavor and even a very nice presentation.  I am a huge fan of chicken tinga so anyplace that serves it gets an A in my book.  This place is another perfect example of that.  The quesadilla  was awesome lots of meat inside along with a great sauce and cheese on the top.    This place rocks and I will be back for sure.  Laura even made the comment this is the first place she has ate at that makes her feel like back home in Mexico flavorwise.

Adovada Ribs need I say anymore?    Great flavor good heat and they are even pulled off the bone for your convenience.    I love hot food so Los Dos is a great spot for me.  I know it's not authentic Mexican but they just really do things right for spice lovers.

Went to Pappadeaux's last night for dinner after a spring training game.  I started with my favorite NOLA beverage the "Hurricane".  It was a blended mix version but still had lot's of alcohol which is never a bad thing.  I then had a cup of Shrimp gumbo that was very spicy and full of flavor.  Finally for the main coarse I had the "Lobster in a Pot".  It is just as it says a 1 lb. Maine Lobster with shrimp, sausage, corn, potatoes, and garlic bread in a pot.  I love being able to eat seafood like this because it's messy and you get to rip apart these sea bugs and really enjoy them.  The broth was full of flavor and was great for bread dunking after all the food was gone.  I can't wait to head back on Wednesday for the Crawfish boil.

Went for the Crawfish boil with some friends last night.  It was awesome I had 3 lbs of Crawfish.  They had very good spice to them and the corn and potatoes in the boil were great as well.  I had a couple strawberry lemonade's to drink which were good they had real strawberries in them not just the flavoring.  Then to top off my already full stomach I ordered the bread pudding.  It was awesome it had apples and blueberries in it and the bourbon sauce just really made it pop.  Great meal and even greater prices.    Bread Pudding: $2.95 Strawberry Lemonade: $2.95 Crawfish: $3.95 a lb

So for my Dad's birthday dinner I decided to show him one of my favorite places to go around the valley.    So we had a reservation at 7:30 and got there around 7:10 which was fine we got to sit outside and enjoy the weather which is awesome this time of year.  At 7:35 we were called to our table.  We already saw the menu outside so we were ready to order once seated.    My dad got the stuffed lobster and I got the Chilean sea bass.  After about 20 min the manager came over and apologized for the wait which I wasn't even concerned about yet.  She said they overcooked the sea bass the first time so they had to re-fire it.  They brought our dishes out about 5 min later.  Everything was good as always and then about 7 min later she brings over this huge piece of sea bass and said again she was sorry.    I was amazed as I was not worried about anything and didn't even get upset for the overcooking the first time.  She also said she was going to comp a dessert for me which worked out great cause it was my Dad's bday so she brought a special creme brulee at the end of the meal with a candle and happy birthday written in chocolate which was just perfect.    I love this place and it brings me back to New Orleans every time I go which is a great place to be reminded of.

Met a friend for dinner last night at Z.  I usually get the southwestern chicken enchiladas but decided to try something new.  I got the chorizo stuffed pork tenderloin.  It had tons of flavor.  They take the tenderloin and roll it up with chorizo sausage and mozzarella cheese.  Then they have this chile cream sauce they put over it.  Just a great dish.  The chipotle salsa and chips  really good as well as you are waiting on your entree.  As usual Z made me leave a happy customer.

I went back with my family that was in town to Over Easy for breakfast.  It was as great as it was the first time.  The service and food were both excellent.  I had the make your own omelet with smoked salmon, cheese, and peppers.  There was the perfect amount of everything in it.  I really enjoy this little breakfast place and my family did as well.  I will definitely be back again.

Went back to Over Easy yesterday for breakfast and it was just as good as I remembered.  The line wasn't very long as it was almost noon on a Saturday which I guess was more brunch but whatever I just woke up lol.  So I got my favorite which is waffle dogs and they were just as great as always.  There is a reason these were on best I ever ate.  The mix of waffle, breakfast sausage, syrup, and cholula just go so well together.  You would never look at those items and mix them but when you try it you will be hooked just like I am.

Just got back from lunch.  Went to go watch the UEFA Champions League games and get a bite.  Had the mussels and leaks and wow amazing.  Wish I could have drank some of the great beers of the world on tap.  Especially the 250 anniversary Guinness for $2.50 a pint yes I typed that right $2.50 a pint.    Great spot to eat and have drinks or in my case a great place to enjoy the game and have a bite.

Went to watch the USA vs. El Salvador friendly.  Tim Finnegans is now an official USA soccer bar.  :)  I had my usual mussles with leeks and bacon and it was great as always.  The beer selection is great and there are plenty of TV's all with the game on and the volume was on all over the bar.  I even like how there are speakers in the bathrooms so if you do have to get up for a break you still now what's going on.  I can't wait to be able to watch the rest of the friendly's and then the world cup here.

On Friday I went in at 6:30am to watch the USA vs. Slovenia World Cup match yes I did just say 6:30am.  The even cooler part was when I got there my first item I ordered and received was a nice cold Kiltlifter.  Oh how good beer is when you first wake up. :)  They had breakfast which was great I got to drink 3 more beers while I watched the match which surprisingly was packed and if it wasn't for a horrible call from the ref was great.  I'll be back Wednesday at 6:30 for the final group match against Algeria.

Ah Bev Mo the Toys R Us store for alcoholics.  I love this place they have everything and more when it comes to snacks and booze.  I shop here for the tremendous beer selection especially the Abita beers from New Orleans.  They always have great deals and the 5 cent wine sale they have is awesome.

Was craving some sushi so decided to check this place out after the reviews I read here on yelp.    I started out with the baked mussels and the sauce was too creamy for my liking and honestly was a bit worried.  Then came out the Alaskan roll which was very good.  Then the heart attack roll came out and wow that was one of the best rolls I've had in Phoenix.    I will totally be back to this place especially after seeing the good happy hour menu.

Went back again last night cause I was craving the heart attack roll.  It was as good as I remember from that long week I had since the last time I ate it.  I also had the Alaska roll again which was also good.  I washed the rolls down with some Sake and Kirin.  Then I cleansed my palate with some yummy green tea and strawberry mochi.  Yen I am sure I will be back really soon thanks again for another great meal.

Went today with a friend and we had a great lunch.  We started with the edamame and ordered 3 rolls.  The first to arrive was the shrimp and soy paper roll.  It was very good it had big pieces of shrimp with some crab and asparagus in it.  They topped it with a creamy sauce that made me not even use my soy sauce for dipping.  We then got the our next two rolls which were the heart attack roll and the shrimp tempura roll.  They were both very good and again covered in a sauce that tasted great with the roll.  We both left very happy and full.

Yay I got my Seattle smoothie fix in Arizona.  I was going to go to Jamba Juice and as I was looking on Yelp for the closest one my dream came true.  Emerald City Smoothie popped up and the 12 miles each way drive was nothing to get the taste of back home in my hands.  I got one of the unique blend smoothies which was cherry and banana and some other goodies in it.  It was great.  They have many options no fat, low sugar, lose weight, bulk me up, and boost my immune system.  So no matter what you need for you health needs you can get it here.  They also have many options for protein drinks and mixes you can pick up while you are grabbing your smoothie.  I am so glad Yelp reunited me with Emerald City Smoothie and I will be back many times to fill up my frequent smoothie card.  =)

Had an amazing dinner last night.  I had heard from this place from my friend at work.  I saw the menu online and had to check it out.  I started with the coconut civeche which is citrus marinated snapper tossed with diced bell peppers, scallions, cilantro and coconut habanero sauce.  It was very good.  We then ordered two entrees first the Soft Duck Tacos which are soft corn tortillas filled with slow braised shredded duck, covered with a roasted tomato-habanero cream sauce, topped with chopped onion, cilantro and sesame seeds.  They were really yummy and you get 3 of them which is more than enough to fill you up.  I got the Veracruz Style Seafood Casserole Fillet of mahi-mahi, clams and shrimp, baked with roasted tomato sauce, olives, capers, chorizo and roasted poblano peppers.  It was amazing.  I will totally go back again and if you haven't been you should totally check it out.

My buddy was DJing on Saturday night at Cin Cin so I headed out with some friends.  I had already ate so just got some drinks which were poured very kindly.  One of my friends got a penne pasta with chicken and chipotle sauce that he said was good and very spicy.  There was a decent crowd all night then at 2am a huge amount of people came in and it was really going for about an hour and a half till closing time.  Overall a cool little restaurant/club.

I love Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf because their owner didn't sell my NBA basketball team to Oklahoma City.  I am originally from Seattle so I am very disappointed the Starbucks owner sold the Sonics so I boycott Starbucks as much as I can.    Coffee Bean is a nice place inside and the coffee is great and cheaper than that other giant as well.  I just wish they had more locations as there isn't one close to my house.

Went to the Farm Kitchen for lunch on Saturday and actually really enjoyed it.  I felt like I wasn't in Phoenix which was really nice.  The location has a different feel to it and I love the alley with trees all down it and picnic tables to eat at.  It was such a good experience.    Now to the food and as much as I enjoyed my turkey curry sandwich and my butternut squash creme brulee I don't think without my groupon I can justify the prices.  I mean come on $10 for a sandwich that's a bit steep.  If it came with chips or something it might be a bit better but that is the only reason I can't give it 5 stars.    I will probably still go back because the ambiance was nice and a nice spring or fall day it would be great to go hang out with friends and enjoy a nice lunch outside.  If they lower the prices to say $7 a sandwich I bet this place would have a lot more business.    If you haven't been to this place I would say for sure check it out they have a lot of local goodies and desserts and as stated on a nice day you can't beat the setting.

I stumbled upon a Pizza making class on Deal Chicken one day and ended up at Classic Cooking.  Right from the beginning I could tell this place was great.  We were walked in sat at a table and brought beverages (wine/beer/water/soda).    Chef Swartz was our instructor and came in and introduced himself and went over the agenda of the class for the evening.  We then followed him into the kitchen to start our lesson.    While in the kitchen he went over step by step on the dough making process including showing us how to twirl a pie which I think it the coolest.  I was able to easily follow along and take notes.    We then were turned loose with pre-made dough to make our own pizzas and calzones like we had been shown.  The pre-made dough helped save time so we didn't need to wait for it to rise.    I chose to make a calzone which I put peperoni, pesto sauce, sun dried tomatoes, and cheese.  It came out in just a few minutes and was excellent.  I can't wait to try some more at home.    The Chef also went through a simple yet yummy ceaser dressing from scratch.  I was amazed at how simple it was that now I think I will just make and bottle my own for use at home.    Overall this class was a blast and I really learned a lot about my favorite food and I can't wait to try making pies at home now.  My attempts in the past just never turned out that good and now I see my flaws in dough making.  I totally will look into another class or two as I think they are well worth the money even without the coupon.

Today we went for our holiday lunch at work and I was very happy and full when we left.  I started out with my favorite the chicken lettuce wraps.  I then ordered off the lunch menu so I got soup with my meal.  I ordered the hot and sour soup which went down in like three spoonfuls.  I followed that with the Moo Goo Gai Pan which was pretty good not the best I've ever had but decent.  Overall 2 out 3 items being amazing and the meal being good I had to give 4 out of 5 stars.

Last night I went to RTO's to watch the boxing match.  They have plenty of tv's and a good crowd for the fights.  I got my favorite thing there the southwest egg rolls.  They are just amazing.  Chicken, black beans, corn, spinach, jalapenos & pepper jack cheese stuffed into a crunchy egg roll wrapper with this amazing chipolte ranch to dip them in.  I honestly could eat 2 or 3 orders of them.  The service was great always had a full beer and was checked on frequently which was nice for how crowded it was.

So after reading Laura L's review I was scared to go to NOCA since the executive chef left as her review was so bad.  I still had faith though that a place this caliber wouldn't go downhill that fast with the rest of the cooks still there.    I had the chef tasting menu and it was up there with the top meals I have ever had and the experience was amazing.    Palate cleanser:   Toasted nuts, raspberries, cheese and balsamic reduction  Appetizer: (upgraded) Lobster roll - So amazing I will be back on a Wednesday just to eat this again  Secondi: Hand Cut Pasta with brown butter and Fennel  Entree: Veal Scallopini-  This was perfectly cooked and the presentation was amazing  Dessert: Cotton Candy Passion Fruit and Coconut  I also paired the meal with the wine accompanies which all were great except the dessert wine didn't really pair with the dessert I got but after I finished it and had a few minutes it went down well but just didn't go with the food.    Other than that I have nothing bad to say about this amazing experience.  I heard many people getting substitutes for things they didn't want and there were no issues.  I think this place is still as good as everyone reviewed and I wouldn't avoid it.    They are searching nationally for a new executive chef and I think that will change things but for now it's still an amazing place and I can't wait to go back.

I stopped in for a quick lunch and I wasn't impressed at all.  I heard that the food was good but I've had better subs almost anywhere.  They have very limited toppings.  I wish I had gone to Mr. Goodcents down the street much better quality subs.

This review is just for Happy Hour:  I finally got to try out BLT Steak granted it was just the happy hour menu but I was still blown away.    For starters the prices are no where near the full dinner items so it really makes it affordable to just pop in and see what this amazing place has to offer.    The drink list is huge and again very affordable.  I recommend the mojito very good and just the right mix of tart and freshness.    For light bites I had the Duck Pate with wine mustard which was very good.  It had some nice earthy flavor that the wine mustard really played well with.  I then got the steak tartar which was just phenomenal.  It had a little kick to it and the steak just melted in your mouth and absorbed all the richness of the quail egg.    I can't wait to go back for dinner service.

I really wanted to love this place as they have the machine to make tacos al pastor properly. The al pastor was still not authentic to what you get in Mexico. One day I hope to find my fix somewhere. Anyways horchata was good and tacos were good. The elote was great with a very spicy sauce to another it in. It's a good spot just didn't blow my mind and in Phoenix with so many great places to go it's hard to say I'll be back.

Finally with help of Kevin V. I made my way to The Mission.  OMG I have been missing out.  I had first tried a tasting of a soup at the Yelp event at Botanical gardens and have wanted to go ever since.  So I had a half day at work today and decided it was the perfect day to go in for a few beers and a bite.    We started off with the grilled corn which was amazing and  full of flavor, then we had the chips and salsa which were great as well.  On to the main course I had the Almejas Al Vapor which is to DIE FOR.  Seriously one of the best soups I have had EVER.    I saw many items on the menu I totally have to come back for especially the duck empenada and the pig roast on Sundays.    Thank you Mission for making me a future repeat customer.

Great name and great Pho what more can I ask for?? :)    I have been going around town since I moved here searching for great Pho as it was a weekly eat back home in Seattle.  Finally I found a place within 15 min of my house to go get some especially to cure the mighty hangover.    The Pho was voted best dish in 2009 here and I can see why.  The broth was full of flavor and the meat was a generous portion and on my order of Pho Tai it actually was rare as it was served to me unlike many other Pho places where it is already cooking in the broth and far from rare upon arrival to me.    The menu had many options on it besides just Pho and I ordered my usual Vietnamese egg rolls which were great as well.  They had shrimp in them so it was a nice seafood twist to the usual pork rolls.    Overall it is a great place to cure your Pho need or cure that hangover.  The only thing preventing it from being a 5 star is that it borders the grocery store and doesn't really capture that separate restaurant vibe it should.

Broasted Chicken is AMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZING!!!    If you have never had it go get some stat.  It is the juiciest fried chicken I have ever had and the scary thing is that this place is like 2 miles from my work.    5/5 stars and a breast, thigh, and potato wedges with a soda for $5.55 great deal as well.

Cream is a great party spot on Wednesday nights.  They bring in the worlds best DJ's and have a great sound system.  Last night I went to see #10 DJ Sander Van Doorn.  WOW the show rocked there was a great crowd and Sander dropped some nasty beats.  It got pretty packed which was expected and overall was just a great night.  I usually only go on Wednesdays as I am an electronic music fan and that's the main night for it.  Fridays are switching up to be off and on electronic.

I came in with the Sonoran Sounder Alliance to watch the Sounders and Red Bulls soccer game.  The tv was a bit small but they did give us the audio which was a very big plus.  They offer their beers in imperial pints which are nice you get an extra four ounces.  They are moderatly priced at $5.50.  I ordered the shrimp and vegetable boxty from a recommendation of our server.  It was very interesting as I've never had a boxty before.  The vegetables were thick cut and very fresh.  The shrimp were cooked well and the white wine sauce was very good.  There is a potato pancake on top of all this which was very good.  Overall we had a good experience even though our team didn't give us the result we were looking for.  Hopefully we will be back for future games here.

First Friday of spring training and it's 70+ degrees. Free parking an f-16 flyover and a fun game between the dodgers and white sox. This is a great park lots of lawn seats and a good amount of infield box seats. I love this addition to our spring training parks in the valley.

So I was craving bruschetta and imagine that it's $20 bottle and board night.  So the decision was easy time to go to Postino's.  I hadn't been to the Central location so I decided I should go check it out.    The bruschetta was amazing as always and the wine went down way to fast ;).  The parking was free valet so I didn't have to worry about anything which was nice.  Inside it was very busy but you would expect that on a $20 board and bottle night.    Overall it was a great evening and I've now been to both locations and love them both.

When it's 118 outside who doesn't love a cool treat?    I had a major yogurt craving and stopped in to check this place out.  They have about 10 flavors of yogurt along with many toppings and fruit to put on it.    They also have boba drinks and ice cream for non yogurt lovers.

Today for lunch my buddy asked if I wanted to go to Joey's and I actually thought an Italian Beef sounded good so I went along to try this place out.  After having real Italian Beef from Portillo's in Chicago and their location in California I was hoping for something close.  They were the closest I've had here in Arizona.  You can order it dunked (self explanitory) wet (a ladle full of juice poured over it, or dry (no juice).  I got sweet and hot peppers on mine and got it wet.  Great lunch was a bit pricey though so that's why I don't give them a full 5 stars.  $10 for a sandwich and drink was a bit much IMO.  If you go only get the Italian Beef as the rest of the stuff didn't seem too appealing.

I finally got to pop my Parlor cherry tonight.  I have been wanting to try this place out as I have heard they have unique and great pizza's.  I am glad I did.  I had the BBQ chicken pizza and it was great.  It was spicy with the Serrano chili's and had a nice tang from the BBQ sauce.  The crust was thin and flaky and overall just a great pie.    They have Kiltlifter on tap which is great for me along with many other 4 peaks beers.    I also liked that they have a garden out front where they grow some herbs that are used in the restaurant.    Great spot I will be back again to try a different pie for sure.

I've been playing kickball for a few seasons and it is a blast.  I play in the AZ Horizon division which allows drinking on the field.  I haven't had this much fun playing a sport in a long time.  I am sure the drinking has nothing to do with it ; )  We always go to Brennan's after the games for some flip-cup action and reduced priced food and pitchers.  If you are considering trying out kickball then you should.  Get a group of friends the like to drink and have a good time and sign up.

There is no better way to start off your day then Fried Chicken and Waffles.  It just puts you on a cloud for the rest of the day.    Lo-Lo's has amazing fried Chicken the same as Mrs. Whites Golden Rule Cafe which I think is the best in the valley and then Lo-Lo's serves it up with golden brown sweet waffles and syrup.  I know most of y'all won't mess with the mixture of hot sauce and syrup but once you let down your guard you will see how well they go together.    If I could I would eat here everyday but then I would be about 400lbs and surely not live too long.

Went last night to see D:Fuse.  It is the only club in  Phoenix with a Funktion One sound system.  The club is really gothic themed inside but it is still pretty cool.  I have only been on a Saturday so I don't know how the crowds are the rest of the week but on Saturday nights it's really good.  They have a great bleacher type seating area right next to the DJ setup which is really cool and a decent size dance floor.  Usually they bring in good DJ's on the Saturday nights and the drink prices are pretty average for a club.

So I finally made the trip to Smashburger and WOW this place rocks.  I got a custom built burger with Chipotle bun, apple wood bacon, chipotle mayo, jalapenos, habenero cheese, and a 1/2 burger.  I also got the smash fries after reading all the reviews about how amazing they were.  Which yes they were.  : )  I was in heaven eating this burger it was dripping out everywhere just like a good burger should.    This is one of my new favorite burger shops in the valley so if you haven't been make the trip it's worth it.

I was in the area and starving for lunch so I popped in and tried their chicken adobo and lumpia and both were good and the adobo was very filling.  Finally I have found another Filipino place I can eat at again since my old fav closed.

YAY finally a Vietnamese restaurant in Phoenix that is worth going to.  I went today with a friend for lunch and felt like I was back home in Seattle.  We shared the Vietnamese Egg Rolls for starters and then had the Pho Tai.  The Pho was $7.00 and came in a huge bowl.  The egg rolls were awesome as always.  I had Coconut Juice with pulp to drink and it was great as well.  I highly recommend this place and am happy it's right by my work I will be here at least bi-weekly if not weekly.

Met a friend for lunch and MAN OH MAN I missed this place.  We started with the Vietnamese Egg Rolls which are very very good.  Then we each got Pho.  I got the Pho Tai which I always get the rare beef adds a perfect amount of extra flavor to the broth.  I really like the food here and will be back again very soon.

I went back today with an old friend and had a great lunch.  She had the chicken pho and I had the rare beef.  We also shared the vietnamese egg rolls which are excellent.  As always the service was great and the food was the best I've had in Phoenix for Pho.  If you like Pho it's my favorite in the valley so check it out.

I wanted to love this place so bad but they just really under-delivered.  '  I went to see the Young Dubliners and Brazen Heads show which actually was pretty good.  The sound was nice and we had a table which made viewing the show really nice.   Food and beverages were the major failure for me.  For starters they ran out of Guiness and Diet Coke.  Let me remind you this is an irish show so Guiness is a major asset and to run out is completely absurd.  The diet coke goes with Jameson and not having that is pretty amazing as well.    I spoke to two seperate staff outside about the Guiness and they told me that I should just do irish car bombs with Moosedrool.  LOL I couldn't believe it no apologies or anything.    My food order was a 16oz grass fed rib-eye and griddled mashed potato's.  Honestly the best part was the side.  The steak had huge globs of unmelted fat in it and I had to saw it with my knife to cut pieces off.  I couldn't believe how badly it was cooked especially with the $24 price tag on it.    I would've given 3.5 stars but the guiness mishap just knocked it down to a complete 2 star failure.

OK thank god for Unphogettable because without going there I would've never found this great market.  I finished my lunch next door and decided to take a stroll through the market to see what they had.  The real question should've been what didn't they have.     I found everything from beef tongue to fresh seafood to durian fruit.  They have an immense fruit and vegetable section.  Their meat section is amazing along with a huge seafood selection that almost made me forget I was in Phoenix and I was in a west coast city.    They also carry tons of Mexican spices and products as well as Indian spices and products.  It's really a cooks dream store.    I am glad I found this great market and even happier it's a tolerable 15 min drive from my house.

OMG why have I never been to this place before.  I know this isn't very traditional pizza but I don't care it's damn good.  I had the Thai Pie which had curry chicken, cucumber, tomato, and onions.  I knew it was going to be daring to try this type of pizza for the first time but I was pleasantly surprised by the fresh ingredients of this pie.    While waiting on our pie I was checking out the beer menu and being a huge fan of Abita beer I was in heaven.  This place has every Abita beer even some on draft.  WOW WOW WOW can a pizza place get any better for me?  Why yes it can 3-6 M-F is happy hour and 10-2 M-F is reverse happy hour.  : )   The only reason I don't give this place a perfect 5 is the wings.  I know this is all personal preference I like fried wings not baked.  I know healthy means no fried food but come on I know that pizza I ate was not healthy so maybe a choice of baked or fried would be nice.    4.5/5 and a new favorite of mine hopefully more open around the valley.

So I went back for a 3rd time already.  This place absolutely rocks.  I could eat here and order something new everytime and leave happy every time.  (except the wings see earlier review)  Today my buddy Cory and I went for lunch and ate the Creole Q pie which was on their new insert.  It was SOOOOOOOO yummy.  It had Creole BBQ shrimp with tabasco, cheese, and a butter garlic sauce.  They even give u extra sauce to drizzle over the top for more flavor.    I know for pizza traditionalists these pies may not be the type you are looking for but for more adventurous on their pies they have many great options.    Thanks again for another great lunch Mellow Mushroom

Ok so it's my 4th time and I had my 4th different pie and still I can't find one I don't think is amazing.  Today I had the Protein pie (not sure the name but something meaty).  It had pepperoni, ham, bacon, sausage, and cheese tons and tons of protein so that means it was healthy ; ).    Mellow Mushroom hit it out the park again and I can't wait to go back for another new pie.

So after reading Daren's review and the others on Rainbow Donuts Yelp page I decided today was the day to finally check this place out.    My friend and I went for lunch and we both really liked it.  She had the Chipotle bowl and I had the Sizzling bowl.  They both had a good amount of spice.  The bowls weren't too greasy and the chicken was cooked very well.    I love teriyaki coming from Seattle and this place is a good one here in Phoenix.  The building isn't in a great location but don't let that worry you the food inside is warm and safe.  :)

I went to Deluxe Dry Cleaners yesterday to drop off some clothes to get clean before heading to LA for New Years and as the sign says $1.95 Cleaners that is for two day service.  If you want it in by 9 and out by 5 you have to pay an extra $.50 per item.  This alone was frustrating because they don't mention this until you walk in.  So I pay the fee and drop off my clothing.  I forgot to pick them up after I left work yesterday so I stop in this morning.  I come to find out the main piece I went to the cleaners for (my blazer) was not at their location.  They sent it out to get cleaned and it didn't make it back.  So as you can imagine I'm not very happy.  She stated oh it will be here first thing in the morning.  I told her that is not an option as I leave for LA in the morning and this is way out of my way.  So supposedly it will be there at 6pm when I get off work.  We will see.  As of now the best they could get was a 1 star so I reviewed it accordingly.  STAY AWAY STAY FAR AWAY  Update:  I picked up my blazer and they ruined most of the buttons on it.  I am very upset as I received it on Christmas and it was getting cleaned to wear the first time.  I will update again after I go talk to the manager.  New Update:  Talked with the manager and they told me they aren't responsible for the manufacturer's buttons on the coat.  They said it is a risk dry cleaning anything because it may get damaged from the chemicals.  I couldn't believe it and will never go back if I could give a 0 star I would.  BBB will be getting a complaint for this place.

So this morning after a bad experience at the cleaners I stop in for some coffee to cheer me up.  I ordered my boss a milky way hot chocolate and myself a holiday treat peppermint mocha latte.  I got my items and went off to work and when I got to my desk my boss was telling me how good her hot chocolate was and I get excited and take a sip of my latte.  WOW that was not what I ordered.  It was a 2% milk latte with no flavoring.  ICK.  So yeah my day is not starting off well.  The donuts here are good I have had them before but today it is a 2 star review due to one being really good and mine being totally wrong.

LOVE LOVE LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE this place.  I have found my new place that I will go to for tacos over all else now.   So my mind was way bigger than my tummy but here is what I ordered:  1. Aztec Tinga Taco- Spicy yummy and honestly one of my favorite Mexican dishes so this was one of my top fav's  2. Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco- This is how I found this place and it was a good taco but didn't stand with my other tacos in taste.  3. Arrachera steak Taco-  This was the first I ate and it was awesome the steak was nice and charred and the flavor was just killer.  4. Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Taco-  Woooooow this one was awesome packed full of flavor and was very moist.  This was another one of my fav's.  5. Gaucho Taco-  This was my total favorite.  It was a carne asada steak taco with avocado and Argentinian Chimicurri sauce on it.  Oh man sooooo yummy I am drooling just thinking about it right now.    Last I had the Horchata which had a interesting twist with fresh fruit and pecans in it.  Honestly it was one of the best Horchata's I've ever had.    On top of all this they have an AMAZING salsa bar with about 15 different salsas for all palates.    If you've never gone take my advice and go and thank me later.  I can't wait to go back probably won't make it past tomorrow.  :)

So I totally should've read the reviews before I went to lunch today.  I wanted to cross off another place on my triple D list so Roberto's is close to my work so I went to check it out.    I ordered the El Pastor plate which has meat, rice, lettuce, beans, and a tortilla.  The El Pastor meat was actually good I enjoyed that but the rice and beans were really bland.  I judge a Mexican restaurant by how their rice and beans are because if they care about those items then there is usually a lot of love in the food.    So overall this is just another run of the mill Mexican restaurant and it's in a gas station so no points there either.  I will have to go to Anthem to try the real Roberto's so I can really cross it off my list.

Great place to find new and used video games for all systems.    Trade in value isn't as good as Best Buy but sometimes you get extra on certain games during promotions so check their website.

I don't know why nobody is talking about this place.  I happened to see it as I was heading to Dos Gringos and decided to head in.  I was very glad I did cause this place is great.  It's very open inside with a huge dancefloor and huge outdoor patio in the back.  I got very quick service from the bar each time I went for a drink.  The inside is pretty much all white hence the name.  There are tables and chairs around the dancefloor to sit and have drinks if you don't like to dance.  The DJ booth is high above the dancefloor and you have to go up and down on a ladder.  Kinda cool. but I'm sure if you are the DJ it's not that cool.  LOL.  They have a huge disco ball hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the club that lights up the ceiling.  Overall a great place to go out for some drinks and dancing.  I will totally be back.

Went to Saddle Ranch to watch the UFC and celebrate a coworkers birthday.  As always I had a great time the fight was free to get into and watch and the food was great.  For starters you get cornbread muffins with this amazing cinnamon butter.  Then I had the baseball sirloin with garlic whipped mashed potatoes and green beans.  The steak was done medium rare and was very tasteful with just enough juice left in it.  The service was very good and we had a great night.  For all your UFC watching needs this is the place to be.  Lots of TV's and they put the whole speaker system on the fight.

I stopped in with a group of friends for Happy Hour after a baseball game at Giants spring training stadium.  We were seated promptly and told about the happy hour specials.  Our server even told us about the frozen margarita's having more alcohol than the ones on the rocks so we went with those :).  For food we just snacked on the Chicken lollipops which were great good flavor and a nice spice to the sauce.  Also we got the ahi tuna tacos which I thought were awesome.  They had great flavor and you got 5 per plate.  They were cold and the jimica taco shell was a nice crunch and change from the usual taco.  Overall with happy hour prices we left very happy and enjoyed our food and didn't get a major hit in the wallet.

Thank god for Starbucks at 5:30am.  =)  I was on my way into work and was in dire need of a wake me up and some breakfast.  I stopped in hoping on a Saturday Starbucks was open and sure enough I was saved.    I got a Venti Caramel Macchiato and a piece of coffee cake.  Both items were exactly what I needed to get me going this morning and keep me awake through my workday.    Starbucks you saved me once again.

A friend and I went to Zinburger for restaurant week and I am so grateful I finally got to try this place out.  When arriving I thought we might have a long wait but we had just the right amount of time we grabbed a beer at the bar and watched the game right about halfway done they called us for our table.    We had both checked out the menu online so we knew what we wanted.  I ordered the Zinburger which had Manchego Cheese, Zinfandel Braised Onions & Mayo.  I got it medium rare and it was amazing.  The juices were dribbling down my arms and it was messy just like a real burger should.  We both got fries to share one order of sweet potato and one of the double truffle.  The sweet potato fries were good but the dipping yogurt was just ok.  Tasted a lot like tzatziki sauce.  The double truffle fries were really good we finished them all.    For the dessert I had the Crème Brûlée Shake that had Vanilla Ice Cream, Madagascar Vanilla Bean, Fresh Cream & Crushed Caramel.  OMG that was my heaven in a glass.  That is one of my favorite desserts and turning that into drinkable goodness I was very happy.    I left in a total food coma and can't wait to go back again.  The service was on point and the food was great as well.

So I totally love the Vig on 40th St and I was glad to hear they opened a new location.  I have been wanting to check it out since it opened but just never had the time.  So what better time to go then on a Sunday for 1/2 price bottles of wine :).    I really love the new location's look.  It was a little hard to find if you have never been but after a drive by I found it on the second pass.  The building is very modern and really open inside.  Instead of the outdoor patio like the 40th st. location they have a huge Arizona room in the back.  It still has a fireplace but instead of a fire it's lit with candles.  This will be really nice for the summer months when the other patio is way too hot.    So on to the food and wine.  I ordered the starter crab and artichoke dip which was heavenly.  For beverage I got a bottle of Lapostolle Casa Sauvignon Blanc.  It was very good and with the half off price it was only $10.50.    On to the entree I ordered the Achiote Salmon and Chorizo Arepa.  The salmon was good but being from Seattle I could tell it was Atlantic.  It's not necessarily a bad thing but I'm kind of a salmon snob :).  Anyways the Chorizo Arepa was very good.  It's a little sweet corn cake with Chorizo in the middle.  EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH CHORIZO!!!!   Overall a great atmosphere, great food, and a great restaurant.   I can't wait to go back for Sunday Brunch they have some great stuff on their menu for it and they open at 10am till 2pm.  MMMMMMMM

I am totally a fan of Five Guys now.  I read an article on yahoo today about how Zagat rated this the best burger chain in the nation.  I have to say I agree they make an amazing burger.  The patties are never frozen which is really nice and shows in the taste.  The ingredients are fresh and the potato's are cut fresh with the skin on.  They use peanut oil to cook the fries in which adds a nice flavor.  I recommend getting the cajun fries they are really yummy.  Overall this is a great spot for a burger totally not good for your waistline but when you want a burger and fries do you really care about that???

So yes I did go back within a week and yes it was still as good as it was the previous time.    I had the small cajun fries and a bacon cheeseburger and soda.  Everything was full of flavor and I was completely full with fries to spare again.    If you haven't been to Five Guys what are you waiting for?  I have been twice in a week obviously that counts for something =)

So I finally experienced Echo Coffee and I realized I should have been there many times before.  It is a great little coffee shop with patio seating and lots of places to relax inside as well.  They offer free Wi-Fi which is a plus.  I went during breakfast time so I had a blueberry scone which was good lot's of Blueberries and good flavor.  I also had a Caramel Latte which was very good.  They had great presentation as well in the foam.    I will totally go back next time probably for lunch they had some great sandwich's on their menu.

So thank you groupon for saving me some money as this place is not worth the admission fee.    I grew up in Seattle so aquariums and sealife are something I really enjoy and usually when traveling I like to go to them to see different regions sea creatures.    Well that's the first problem Phoenix is a desert and I should know better than to go to an aquarium here but I was intrigued as it was new and I got a good deal on tix.    The tanks were small and too many people in too much of a confined area for my liking.  I felt people were angry for you taking more than 30 seconds to look at something or take a picture.    The talk times were a waste as they were all too crowded and you couldn't see anything.  There was one cool tank that had a second level to go above and look down on it which gave the best view in the place.    Overall I say drive to California go to a real coastal aquarium and save your money.  Heck even go buy a DVD or something.

I am so grateful to say I have had the famous Rocket Burger.  This place gets so much Yelp praise and for great reason.    The soda selection is off the hook every soda you grew up with and then some all in coolers in bottles the even got YooHoo.  Fries are all natural cut and amazing there is just something great about fries with the skin on them they just taste better.   The burger was Phenomenal I had the Santa Fe which had the amazing Rocket Sauce, bacon, and fried green chili.  It was outta this world good.    I will be a loyal customer and I am sure will post numerous updates to this review cause this place is just that good.

I really didn't have anything I thought was good let alone great so I don't see myself going back anytime soon.    They have sushi but I was very scared to eat it as it's a desert and who knows how fresh that raw fish was.  I am ok eating it at a nice place that is busy but at a cheap place I'll pass.  I guess if you are looking for a place to get a lot of food for your money and aren't looking for quality asian food then this would be a good place but I'll stick with going to order better quality off the menu places.

I went with a buddy for lunch and WOW horrible.  We got seated and waited 15 minutes before even being asked for beverages.  Finally after getting our drinks our orders got taken.  I ordered the Buffalo Ranch Chicken sandwich.  I'm sorry but it tasted just like something I could have gotten at Chick Fil A for a third of the price.  I was totally not impressed.    I have had wings before at another BWW and they were good so I know not everything is bad but I wouldn't order anything but wings from now on.  That is if I ever go back.  Native New Yorker has better wings so it's tough to want to go to a BWW in the future.

Last night for dinner my grandma was craving some pasta so I turned to trustworthy Yelp for some help to find a place with pasta open on a Sunday.    To start we ordered the Bruschetta which was served heaping portions on the bread.  It was very messy to eat and yet so good.  They also brought out some foccacia bread which was wood fired and amazing.  It made me want to get the pizza.    Since we were on the pasta theme I had the linguini with clams and finally I get REAL CLAMS IN THE SHELLS.  I was blown away by the pasta and I can't wait to go back.  The white wine and garlic sauce was excellent and the non canned clams just made it perfect.    This place is amazing if you have a chance check it out.  I will for sure be back many times now and I am very curious of how the pizza is.  The prices were perfect for the quality and portion size.  The place was not busy but I am sure when more try this place out that will change.

Don't sleep on this place it is LEGIT.  I am so thankful restaurant week led me to Nobuo finally.    First Course:  Hassun (4 piece sampler anitpasto and sashimi plate) It was amazing Edamame chilled soup and Japanese Kimchi with dried shrimp were the highlights.  Sashimi Course: Yellowtail and Grapefruit- Served on a spoon to get it all in one bite.  The flavors were just amazing and paired very well together.    Entree Course: Sea Bass & Japanese Mushrooms Baked in Parchment- This was absolutely AMAZING.  I will go back just for this dish.  I don't even like mushrooms and I don't think there was even one left when I finished this course.  The sea bass was cooked perfectly to chopstick tender perfection.   Then a little rice cake to soak up the sake juices with just really made this the perfect dish.    Dessert Course: Arai Pastry Japanese Desserts- Three desserts from Arai Bakery in Tempe that were a perfect way to finish the meal.  One cream puff with strawberry, a creme de caramel, and a orange mousse served on an orange peel.    I can't wait for my chance to head back to Nobuo to try more of the James Beard award winners cuisine.  It is for sure top notch.

This was the marriage of two of my favorite things alcohol and ice cream.  As Charlie Sheen would say "Winning!!!!"  I had a groupon so Laura A. and I went to try out this amazing place.  The groupon got us each two scoops so we went with 4 different so we could sample the most possible.  I got the Apple Pie / Spiced Rum and Black Raspberry / Chambord Liqueur.  Both were awesome I actually enjoyed the Chambord the most but I was in ice cream heaven.    Laura got the Mimosa with Champagne and the Margarita / Tequila.  I really enjoyed both of her's the margarita was a strawberry one which is my fav.  The Mimosa was very refreshing and I could imagine that being a great hangover remedy at about 11am on a Saturday =) just sayin.    I have found a new place to cure my sweet cravings and can't wait to try more flavors as the website has many more I didn't see in store so I assume they are on rotation which is great.    I hope that eventually I can find a pinapple upside down cake with rum flavor

So after a not pleasing meal at another Tapas restaurant I decided to go and get some real Spanish food.  Unfortunately I was somewhat filled up so I didn't get to enjoy much of the food but I sure took in some wine =).    I started with a glass of Vino Verde Sangria ~ White wine Sangria it was very good had plenty of fruit and I ended up having 3 glasses before the night was over.  I also tried Kalimotxo ~ Basque red wine and cola.  It sounded really odd to me so I had to try it and actually it was surprisingly very good.    For food I had the Pimiento de Piquillo con Centollo ~ Crab stuffed peppers in a saffron sauce.  There were two peppers in a great flavored sauce and they were full of crab and flavor.  Also there were really good rolls with a garlic aoili that was good.    For dessert I had Pastel de Pan ~ Banana & Apple Bread Pudding.  It wasn't a traditional bread pudding more like a soft bread cake with ice cream.  It was also very good and at this point I was extrememly full.    Overall a great restaurant and I will for sure be back to try more of the menu when I have a bigger appetite but a great first experience none the less.

Saturday I had lunch with my girlfriend and her family to celebrate her Mom's bday.  We had a great meal and the weather was perfect on the patio.    Just like my previous visit I loved the food I had oxtail which was amazing and crab stuffed peppers.  Our server Kevin was great and took very good care of us.

As their website name says Mauidogsrocks and I agree.  I would've never even imagined putting together this Island dog (all beef brat, chipotle garlic mayo, maui mustard, coconut, pineapple, and bacon) let alone ordering it and loving it, but I did indeed do just that.  I have ate teriyaki burgers before so I get the concept but I've just never had it on a hot dog before.    The only thing I can say I didn't enjoy is I sat at the drive through window for about 3 min and nobody came so I had to go inside and order to go.  So with that said if you like hot dogs and want to be a little adventurous then what are you waiting for get to Maui dog and start your Mahalo card cause after 12 you get your 13th free.

Very slow service on Thursday's no amber beers in stock so I would avoid this place like the plague.  I ordered a Cuban sandwich and it came on a bun. I guess I'm weird but I prefer mine on bread like a regular Cuban. The server was nice but they are just too understaffed. At our table many food items were 1.5 hour wait which is just totally unacceptable. Then the taste just wasn't worth the wait. Maybe Gordon Ramsey needs to come in and turn this kitchen nightmare into a nice flowing restaurant.

I hate giving bad reviews because I hate spending money at places to not enjoy my meal.    So I ate at Jimmy Woo's and had the shrimp in lobster sauce.  The food just really didn't taste that great and I totally was not impressed.  After tossing half of my meal I called it a night.  Well Jimmy didn't think so I barely made it home and I was seriously sick from what I ate.  I won't get into details but totally not a fun experience.    I see many people have went there and been fine but I for sure will never go back unless just to drink.  I can't eat somewhere I got sick at again ever.  Too bad it's got a great location and nice bar.

Well I am not a huge fan of Streets of New York but this experience was just horrible.  I was with some friends after hiking and went to Streets of New York to grab a bite to eat as none of us had dinner before the hike.  We ordered wings and pizza to all share as none of us had huge appetites after hiking.  First our drinks took way too long to get and then refills were almost so bad I was going to go refill them myself.  The food was very sub par for Streets Of New York.  I don't think I will be back to this location and I am not the only one as a Friday night it was pretty empty.

Last night I made it in to Beckett's Table after hearing so much about it and everyone was spot on.  The space is terrifically laid out very open and well decorated.  We were greeted by the hostess and shown to our table.  Our server came over right away with fresh water and menu's.  So far so good.    Laura ordered the Salmon which was excellent I am very picky with my fish being from Seattle and I would've ate that whole dish.  The Cous Cous was great and a nice salad on the side to tie it all together.    I ordered the Pork Osso Buco Confit which my server said was his favorite.  I see why because this pork was fork tender and just falling apart.  I really enjoyed the dish and the roasted veggies were great.  I didn't even know what half of them were and I was still enjoying them all.    I wish I had room for dessert because they had one I really wanted to try so I will be back for the Chocolate dipped bacon s'mores.    Overall a great dinning experience and it's close to home so that's even better.

What a great find.  Thanks Yelp.  I was really craving a great deli sandwich and after searching through Yelp I decided to head to European Bakery and Deli and was greated by the owner was very nice and assisted with picking out a great sandwich for my taste.  I went with the Prosciutto di Parma which had authentic Prosciutto and fresh cut cheese and lettuce with oil and vinegar.  It was very delicious.    The Bakery looked amazing with tons of great dessert items that I was way too full to try but it gives me a reason to head back right?

I am amazed with the bad reviews I went here last night and had a great experience.  I agree the prices were a bit steep compared to Thai places I have had in Seattle but it's Phoenix, AZ and the food was good.  I will pay for good food anyday.    I had the curry seafood and it was awesome.  I loved the flavor I didn't get asked for a star for spiciness which I would like to in the future but now I'll just ask myself.  I also had the Thai lemonade which was very tasty.  I can't wait for the liquor license in the next month to see what kind of specialty drinks they think up.    I spoke with the owner Eric who was our server and he was very nice and told of all his plans for the future including patio's to dine and a Saturday market.  Also frosting of the glass dividing the dining area and bar to eliminate the tv glare and separate the rooms which was a complaint I saw here.   I think this place has huge potential and they have to go orders that you can pick up at the drive through window which makes hang over thai food a huge YES.    I will be back many times as this is close to my house and the food was great.  I will continue updating and hopefully be giving 5 star reviews soon.

I wanted to update my review and say this place is still a top notch Thai place in Phoenix.    For starters I had the Crab Wonton's which are a must.  They come with an amazing dipping sauce and have a generous amount of crab not Krab in them which is what makes the difference from a lot of these cheap places in town.    For the entree I had the Seafood Hot Pot which is full of Shrimp, scallops, clams and calamari with tomatoes and sliced fresh mushrooms in a hot and sour lemon grass broth. I ordered it Thai hot which was great to open up my sinuses and keep my tummy warm : ).    Everything from the food to the service at this place is top notch.  Don't miss out on this one.

I was hoping for some good Mexican food as this place is close to my work but that was far from what I got.  I felt the sevice was the only good thing at this place.  I judge a lot of places by their salsa and it was just lacking bold flavors or spice.  My meal was just average at best and I highly doubt I will be heading back.

Thanks to Groupon I got to come try out TK's Urban Tavern.  I really like this space and it's more of a restaurant then a Tavern or bar for that matter.    The food was great I had the grilled halibut and it was very good.  It was cooked to perfection and came with some fingerling potato's as a side.    The prices were comparable to a nice restaurant but I thought the quality deserved that so don't be mistaken by the name as it's not bad quality bar food by any means.    I didn't have any drinks as it was Sunday night, but they have just standard stuff and not a huge beer selection.    Overall a nice spot to enjoy a nice meal especially on the patio with the weather getting nice for that.

So after the billet bar finally closed Bar 350 popped up and I hoped they would get away from the wannabe biker bar that billet was and the wannabe crowd that always hung out there.  Unfortunately my hopes are not going to come true.  Inside not much has changed and the crowd is still the same as well from what I saw on Sunday.  I hope this changes eventually cause it's a great location right across from RnR and the prices for drinks are cheap.

I saw a sign when this place first opened about showing the UFC fight so I assumed they would do that again this last weekend.  I meet some friends here and even called ahead to make sure they were showing the fight and the girl who answered the phone said yes for sure.  So we arrived an hour before fight time and sat down and the waitress said you aren't here for the fight are you? We said yes we were and called ahead and she said they were not going to show it.  She offered us a free round for the inconvenience but that is not something I was looking for as my intention was to watch the fight and now we had to rush to find a new bar to view the fight at.  So this pretty much solidified my views of this bar and I doubt I will ever be back.

So I walked into Upper Crust and then totally felt like I was transported to Patsy Grimaldi's. The Decor, the glasses, the tablecloths I mean everything was identical.  I love Grimaldi's so I guess this isn't a bad thing for me.  So after sitting down I was given a menu and again blown away it's Grimaldi's menu but vertical not horizontal.  This was just getting weird, but I was there so I went with it.  I placed my normal Caesar salad small as it's huge (just like Grimaldi's) and a pizza with just sun dried tomato's for topping.  Prices are similar to Grimaldi's so nothing wrong there for good food.  The pie is identical except no coal flavor from the oven which is good because I can still say Grimaldi's is my favorite.

Dr. Jenni and her staff are amazing.   I hadn't been to a Chiropractor in 10 years and wow I needed to get back to it.  I have one messed up back.    Dr. Jenni and her staff do a great job of treating you as a real patient not just another $ walking through the door.    For anyone looking for a Chiropractor I would totally recommend AFC.

Went to Studio Movie Grill to see The Raven and really enjoy this place.  For one there is plenty of parking and usually plenty of seating in the theaters.  I do admit that the prices are a little steep, but again we are at the movies when have you ever had a deal unless you go to the dollar theater. The ticket prices are very similar to a regular theater and they seem to be on Groupon frequently so watch out for those that will help make up for the increased food prices :)

Checked this place out today for lunch after several recomendations from friends.  I didn't have any sushi so no report on that, but I did however have some AMAZING short ribs.  They had some great drink specials but do to having to go back to work I couldn't partake so after work Happy Hour is coming soon.  Very clean spot great service and everyone I was with had great meals so this will be part of my sushi rounds from now on.

They didn't skimp on the lox at all which was great.  I couldn't even finish the whole thing.    I will for sure make a trip back to this place when I'm on this side of town.

This is going to be dangerous having a Pho place this close to my house that's open until 2am.    I went due to a Groupon and now will be a steady regular.  The Pho is one of the best I've had in the valley.  I sampled it before I doctored it up with sauces and it was full of flavor and would've been great as is, but I like it spicy so I add quite a bit of Siracha and chili flakes.    I ordered the Pho Tai large which was a HUGE 50oz bowl with plenty of noodles and meat.  I also got the crispy vietnamese egg rolls which came as an order of 4 and were excellent.    The service was very good never had to ask for a water refill or wait long for ordering or to get food.    Overall this place is great I have not had the experience I see with others on here and hope I never do because this place will for sure be in my regular rotation.

Q Up is the bomb I need to say no more.    Today two of my coworkers and I went to check the Q out as the truck was about a block away from our office.    The Food: Pulled Pork Nachos:  Homemade tortilla chips, fresh smoked pulled pork, nacho cheese, green onions, tomatoes, and homemade BBQ sauce.    Bacon Mac and Cheese:  It describes itself all homemade and smoked and then we topped it off with homemade BBQ sauce.  WOOOOOOOOOW it was delicious.    We also sampled smoked sausage and brisket both with a mustard bbq sauce and both were stellar.    This guy is LEGIT he makes killer fusion food that will leave you so full because you can't stop eating it's so good.    Follow him on twitter to find where he will be: @QupBBQ

Well not much to update here it's still damn good and it's only been 5 days since last visit.    Today I had: Pulled Pork Sandwich with Southwest Slaw and mustard bbq sauce.  It was amazing the slaw alone was outstanding but then pile it on top of a mound of smoked pork goodness and top it all off with tangy sweet sauce and you got yourself a winner.    I also had a side of bacon mac and cheese obviously it is a must and it was just as amazing as last week.    Best thing is he is going to be by my job in two days with fresh brisket : ) I can't wait.

I'm so happy they put a location in Old Town.  I had been to the location in South Phoenix before and it was awesome as well.    I had the Chopped BBQ which is Turkey, Chicken, and Beef all chopped up and cooked in BBQ sauce.  It was very very tasty.  They gave me two pieces of bread to make a sandwich and with the 1/2lb order I still had more left over.    For my side I got the Texas Cream Corn which I really enjoy.  It has great flavor and is an excellent compliment to the BBQ.    The location has a nice patio for the great weather we are having and you can also sit inside on picnic style tables.

Bacon wrapped Lychee need I say more....  I never in my wildest dreams thought to wrap Lychee fruit in cooked bacon, but I am glad the chef at Sochu House did.  What a wonderful mix of sweet and salty.  Both times I have been to Sochu House this has been a must order.    They have plenty of Sochu drinks and infused vodka's and on Sundays great Martini specials and great House music.    I have never been just for dinner so I can't comment on that but Sunday nights are a great atmosphere with great food and drink specials.

I fear that this place is going to get out of hand very shortly.  Please people keep to Matt's Big Breakfast and Over Easy keep the crowds away.    Ok Ok I can't be selfish but I wish I could this place is awesome.    Everything from the Japanese cold brew coffee to the espresso's to the amazing food.  I have had the pain perdu which is bannana bread french toast fresh bannanas sliced on top and a whiskey caramel sauce on top and the savory crepes with chicken and egg inside and a homemade sauce over the top.  Both dishes were AMAZING I will for sure go back just for those, but will have to try the rest of the menu first.    I am very greatful I have Monday and Tuesday's off to avoid the weekend crowds because I am sure they will be starting very soon.

I was really hungry today and I decided to stop in cause I was craving some seafood.  For starters the place is not nice inside or out.  I almost considered just not going but since there was a good review I decided to stay.    I ordered the crab and shrimp ceviche tostadas.  I was totally not impressed.  The crab had pieces of shell in it and the shrimp had no flavor.  The only good thing was the coke in a bottle but I can get that at the grocery store so unfortunately I was very disappointed.

A new top of the Pho list for me.  30 Flavors of Boba for starters sold me right out the gates.  I had the Lychee Boba and it was bomb.  Also ordered the crispy egg roll which was much bigger than normal which is a plus hopefully they keep them that size it's well worth the value.  Full of flavor and very crispy.  Last but not least the Pho....  The broth was clear like it should be also very nice flavor before even adding all my sauces and herbs.    Overall this place is awesome and it's close to work so I see myself here at least bi-weekly.  They have only been open 3 weeks so far so I am sure it's going to get busier soon as it is the best around this area.

Finally La Condessas sister spot is open. If you love La Condessa and are on the Westside then make sure to come in. The Horchata is the best I've ever had. My favorite tacos are the chicken mole, tinga, cochinita pibil, and el gaucho. They have a huge salsa bar with tons of options.

So went today for lunch and wasn't overly impressed.  I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Quesadilla and it was just cheese blend and meat.  There was no sauce in the quesadilla and it was an over abundance of cheese.  You couldn't even taste the smoke on the meat.  I did open it up and add sauce which helped but still the amount of cheese really took away from the item.    The place was very clean inside with lot's of seating so that was the positive.  There menu had several options as well so maybe I'll have to try something else if I ever go back.    I overheard our waitress telling a table they were busy in the beginning and now it's been really dead so I take that as a sign that I'm not the only one that thinks they are just ok.

Great spot to welcome to Washington row. I'll be back for sure. Great drink prices and lots of room inside. I came to watch a game and they gladly changed it to an out of state team game.
