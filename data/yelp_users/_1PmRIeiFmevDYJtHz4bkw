Charlotte airport seems to get better and better every time I pass thru.  Security is mmmm... Ok. Allow extra time.  They have a great selection of food in the food court between the B & C concourses.  The sushi bar is wonderful.  I wish the city would take the time to modernize the concourses themselves.  Gate areas and lounges seem to be a little outdated. Starbucks... Galore! The one next to B9 is fast moving and fast paced.  Don't be discouraged of the line is long.  Always buy food before you get on the airplane!

It's PF Chang's, it was consistent with their product but something about this location turned me off.  I sat at the bar for HH.  Crispy Green Beans were excellent but my spicy tuna roll tasted like it was pulled out of the fridge and cut.  Did not taste fresh at all.  I wish I had ordered lettuce wraps instead.  Nothing exciting about the staff.  A lot of them seemed to be standing around.  The bartender was friendly but chose to stand and stare into space instead of engaging his customers.  He also had a conversation over me with another employee about clocking in.

Breakfast at Armando's is awesome.  I always get the steak, egg and cheese burrito. Recently had lunch for the first time and had the Chicken Enchilada plate with red sauce and it was awesome.  The girls that work there are always nice and friendly.  I just wish they had a beer license.

Phoenix Airport is getting better day by day.  I primarily use Terminal 4.  Security check points are great if staffed properly.  Terminal 4 food has done a 360 since last year, all new eateries on every concourse! So pick your poison.  I love the new Blanco's Taqueria on the low A concourse, new windows with lots of natural light coming in. The gate areas could use come updating, more power ports are needed.

I've been to Dr. Waring now twice.  He is an outstanding physician!  The Doctor and his staff are very professional and nice.  I have high anxiety every time I go to Dentists and Doctors and these people make me feel very comfortable.  His office and facilities are very nice and modern.

My first time visiting Dr. Tracy (2004) I was so embarassed, I had not been to a dentist in 9 years.  My anxiety was thru the roof to say the least.  Even though I had a long list of issues to take care of and in tears, she reassured me that we would get thru them one at a time and there was nothing to be embarassed about.  Over the years, I have spent many hours in the chair slowly getting everything in my mouth fixed.  Dr. Tracy has been caring, professional and is highly respected by her peers in the community.  I had to see  both an oral surgeon and a periodontist as directed by Dr. Tracy, both Doctors held her in high regard when they looked to see who the referring Dentist was.  Mill Avenue Family Dentistry from the front office to the hygienists have been so wonderful over the years, and have been so great accomadating me at a moments notice.  If you are new in town and looking for a famiy dentist, this is the place to be!

The New office is amazing! Had some major dental work done today and I couldn't have been more comfortable!  4 hours in the chair, 2 movies on Netflix on the new flat screen which I could see while my procedure was being done... I'm a happy girl! Dr. Tracy is amazing!

Wooooohoooo!  As good as it gets!  My rear bumper made out with a fire hydrant and put a nice dent in my Prius.  After getting a few over priced quotes that I didn't feel were right, I took a chance and took my search to YELP.  I went to visit Exclusive Collision Center and they gave me a price that was very fair.  With all the great reviews I knew this was the place. I picked up my car today and it is back to just off the dealership lot pretty.  The employees are honest and pretty awesome!!  Thanks again!   Nicole

Your 36th St and Thomas has got to be the worst Wal Mart in the world.  While I am sure this is going to fall on deaf ears as all my other complaints will today's terrible experience was your shopping carts.  I entered your store on the West side to shop.  There were no baskets available for my small shop so I went for a shopping cart.  15 carts pulled apart later I was able to find one that worked.  Broken, dented, wheels locked trash in them..... come on!!!!! During this whole time there is a greeter 10ft away from me who pretended like he didnt see a thing.  I wont lie... I yelled at the poor guy.  This situation is ridiculous, why are these broken carts being put in the bay for customers if they don't work or are cleaned out? Your greeter should be helping people with carts, not standing there doing nothing. So I shopped quickly and got in the checkout lane as quickly as possible at the worst Wal Mart in the world and the same guy came up to me to apologize and that he notified a manger.  BFD, nothing was being about it, the same broken carts were still sitting there when i walked out.  A little old lady was struggling to find one and I ended up giving her mine.  Not one of your employees... me.  Get your act together please, you are a multi billion dollar company and pay no attention to the worst Wal Mart in the world!

I stopped in for a glass of wine after a unsatisfactory dinner some where else.  I had a glass of Pinot Noir and a great chat with the bartender.  He was nice enough with no hesitation to plug in and charge my phone for me.  I glanced over the menu and it looks great.  I hope to come back soon and try the wonderful food.  Watching from the bar, the staff was very professional and the atmosphere was very bistro like and relaxing.

I really didn't get into Sushi until a few years ago.  I've tried a few places around Phoenix and Stingray has been consistently the best! Their fish appears and tastes fresher than other sushi bars.  The Staff at the Biltmore location has always been courteous and genuinely nice.  Great for happy hour!!!!

So I went to N Counter last week, had a terrible experience! I went as far to write a letter to 3 email addresses listed on their site... and no response. So here it is :)  To who it may concern:       I just arrived back from lunch at N Counter and am still considerably upset at just what happened. I tried to use the contact  us button on your website but it appears there is no confirmation when trying to hit send.    I was able to leave my office and enjoy a lunch date with my boyfriend, which is very important to me since we have conflicting schedules.  We jokingly argued where to eat lunch, I wanted N Counter for your great salads and he wanted to go to Cheba Hut for their big sandwiches... I won.  Since I am eligible for expenses at my job, when I approached the register I told the cashier clearly before ordering that I needed to pay for mine separately and will need an itemized receipt for reimbursement.  I ordered clearly a Fushion Chopped Chicken salad and a soda, he then swiped my card.  I bring up my order because I have had in the past received the wrong chopped salad because I didn't say Fusion, always learn from my mistakes, right?  After swiping my card, he said he needed to wait for my boyfriends order for an itemized receipt so our food was on the same ticket.  I let him know, that's fine as long as my receipt included my food only.  Of course after J ordered, swiped his card and the itemized receipt had all of our food on it.  I was very disappointed, because I was very clear and polite on what I needed.  After he pulled the receipt, he asked if it would be a problem?  Yes, it is actually... that's why I asked twice. So the young man went and got a "manager" which may be one of you on this email, he looked at me and said it was not possible to get a different receipt. I explained my needs to the manager and let him know I asked twice,  I was very frustrated to say the least but remained professional.  I then was told by the manger to " CALM DOWN".  I was in complete shock, I couldn't believe it.  He said this to me in front of a full line of people, I was so embarrassed.  He put in the order again, with a no make and handed me the receipt and I walked away.  I usually speak up for myself when necessary but I had no words for his behavior towards me as a customer.  We sat down outside, I am trying to shake it off and enjoy the rest of my lunch hour.  The runner brought our food and it was the wrong salad, I questioned it politely and said I ordered the Fushion chopped.  She just stared at me and I felt very uncomfortable, so I offered to take the salad and interest of eating with my boyfriend.  She then offered to get me the proper lunch.  Again I was flustered.  The salad came quickly and was able to salvage  some of my lunch date, when she dropped the salad off we realized we never got the cupcake we paid for on the second bill so we had to ask for that too.  So all in all, what usually is a fantastic  or generally okay experience and a great lunch or breakfast was awful, embarrassing, waste of time and money.  I work very hard for everything in my life, my time is important to me, I treat everyone with respect and kindness and don't deserve to feel how I am feeling this afternoon after leaving your establishment. Next time... Cheba Hut!  Respectfully,  N

5 stars all the way! Finally tried my first yoga class 3 months ago with Harmony and loved it! I've been to several other instructors all are so amazing! If you're new to yoga, try the ABC Yoga on Tues and Thursdays it's a great way to get started! Finally broke into Phenomenal Flow, it's challenging but just what I need.  It's like true therapy and has changed my life with the way I feel mentally and physically.  I finally went to spin 101 and will be trying my first spin class soon! I'm excited because every time I walk by it's truly a party on a bike.

Señor Taco 2 is amazing!  We come here for breakfast at least twice a month.  The staff is always friendly and atmosphere is casual.  The breakfast items are quality and a good value.  Try the chillaquilles, que bueno!

SEED Cafe has been replaced with Kaleidoscope Juice. Some of the same menus items are still available. They seem to be a lot busier than the old Cafe. I love the new coffee they brought on scene. However a bit disappointed that my smoothie order has been lost twice in the shuffle.

My second time at Ingo's and it was hit! I love the concept of a gourmet food stand! Quick, easy and inexpensive.  We've sat both times inside at the bar so we can watch the action in the kitchen.  Great menu and great service. The tuna burger is awesome and full of flavor.  Must have the shattered chips! I will be making regular stops here, what a great addition to the neighborhood!

Doing errands in the area and stopped here for lunch.  What a great place! Perfect place to watch sports, final 4 basketball on the big screens while we were here.  They turned music on during the break.  Service was nice, even down to bus boy who we chatted up. Tacos were amazing! I had the braised pork shoulder al pastor and my partner had the beef cheek which were recommended by the bus boy.  Beef cheek tacos all the way! I'm sure this place gets crazy packed at night, which isn't for me. Lunch? Anytime for this mid 30 something.

Visited the shop for the first time today, first off I am so impressed!  This is exactly what the Fountain Hills Community needs.  As we all know our sleepy snowbird town has some world class cycling and mountain biking, now we have a bike shop to support that!  The employees were awesome and super friendly.  The store has a modern appeal and great retail selections for all things bike.
