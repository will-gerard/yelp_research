Primp and dry on camelback had consistently great service.  I highly recommend this location

Fun place but don't go there for the food.   We had the buffalo blue chicken - it was dry with bad bread.   The ribs were chewy and didn't finish them.   The hamburger was pretty good but not fantastic.   The menu is limited and hard to read.   There is not to much for the healthy eater.   The country bar part is good and the line dancing would be fun.   Have dinner some place and head over after.
