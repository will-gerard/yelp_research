I have been to this club about 8 or 9 times, always on fridays for Transylvania.  The scene is goth and punk, although you won't feel too out of place if you don't fall into either of these categories (I don't).  Think "The Matrix" meets "Blade."  The house DJ here is usually pretty amazing...spinning music like VNV, Wolsheim, and some harder stuff like KMFDM.  The sound system is hot, and the music selections combined with the pulsating, dancing crowd (in more black leather than you've probably seen for awhile in one place) make for a pretty hot environment.  The vibe isn't always on, as once or twice I've been here fairly disappointed with a predominently poser crowd.  If you happen to get here on an off night, just relax on the stunning back patio with a few drinks and create your own scene.  But that being said, the club itself is gorgeous, and you're in for a surprise at midnight.  So get here no later than 11 and have a few drinks before the club kicks it up a notch.

Great food, try the rice noodle dishes and ask for it "dry".  Also, the lemongrass scallops are fantastic.  They obviously don't care a bit about the decor, and you'll feel like you've walked into someone's ratty old apartment, but this is one of those rare cases when the food makes up for it.  The menu is a bit intimidating - it has 15-20 pages of dishes, but they staff is willing to help you make up your mind.  Some things not to try (I've been here several times, and not every menu item is good) - the 5 flavor squid has a creepy salty/sugary thing going on, and the sweet/sour pork is a little too dry and salty.  Everything else so far has been great.

Ok, a bit of explanation why I gave this place 2 stars.  The food is good...it is your traditional lasagna, ravioli, and pasta fare.  Not the best I've had, but it tastes great when you're craving traditional Italian.  However, the service here is so slow that it literally took almost 2 hours for me to get my food.  The waitress was stressed out, even though the place wasn't busy.  So I think there may have been a staffing problem the day I went.  Maybe I'll try it again some day and see if the service gets better.

I was here with friends for drinks and dinner last Thursday evening, and I have to say that nothing about this restaurant was acceptable for any of us.  First, we didn't have reservations and were greeted with slightly rude service by the host.  However, I think she noticed that we were a little taken aback by the attitude, and quickly changed her mood.  In the downstairs bar, we ordered drinks while we waited for a table to open up for us.  The bartender made a mistake while preparing my friend's Bloody Mary, accidentally dumping an enormous amount of tabasco in her drink.  However instead of simply making a new one, he served it to her anyway (admitting his mistake while setting it down in front of her) and told her to let him know if she didn't like it and wanted a new one.  Of course she tried it, couldn't drink it and had to ask for a new one.  After we got to our table upstairs and ordered our appetizers and meals, things got worse.  It took well over half an hour to get our appetizers, and when we did they were cold.  We were not sure that our oysters were supposed to be as cold as they were, but the fact that they had congealed melted cheese seemed to indicate that they should haver at least been warm.  After we finally got our salads (about 45 minutes after ordering), we were rushed through them before getting our meals just a couple minutes later.  None of us enjoyed our meals, as we found them either burnt or bland.  Even though we made a few complaints about our meal to the server, when our check came we found that we had been charged for everything and were only offered a very pallid apology for the obvious problems with our meal.  this was not an inexpensive meal, either, so we will likely not be back!

I second the Spanish latte, best coffee drink I've had so far - it's sweetened with condensed milk.  What I like about this place is that it has the feel of a bigger-than-phoenix downtwon coffee bar, even though this place isn't downtown.  Browsing the shop is a good way to pass time while you drink your coffee.  The pizza next door is great (as good as Bianco I think) and the service is excellent (much better than Bianco).

I have to say, I have always had a good impression of Halo, even though I have never used their services.  In June, I decided that I wanted to go get both of my ears pierced, so I went to Halo because it was the first piercing joint that came to mind. I thought surely they would do just a regular ear piercing, even if it was probably going to be significantly more expensive than the mall. Well, I was wrong. I spoke with this guy at the counter who proceeded to tell me that the shop doesn't pierce with studs. The conversation went something like this:  Me: Why? Pin Cushion: Stud earrings don't exist that meet our strict guidelines. Me: What? (as I look in the case and see studs) Really? Pin Cushion: We only pierce with surgical steel hoops or rods, the APA doesn't allow us to use inferior quality studs. Me: Really? Oh no, so you're saying I have to go to the mall? Pin Cushion: I wouldn't recommend anyone go to the mall. Did you know that they can't guarantee every single piece of the piercing gun is sterile? Me: Huh? Pin Cushion: Yeah but if you want to whatever, I understand your situation. It's not rocket science, a 16 year old at Claire's can do it for you. Me: Ok... Pin Cushion: But you know it will take 3-4 months to heal, and it isn't sterile. Me: Um... Pin Cushion: Have you seen the training video for the piercing guns? They have kids doing it. Me: No, I haven't... Pin Cushion: I can pierce you with some hoops and you can take them out in 6 weeks and put studs in if that's what you really want. Me: Ok um, bye...  So I was really frustrated, because now I was gonna have to go to a pink and sparkly store with kids hopping all around to get my ears pierced, in that chair right behind the window for onlookers to see. But I was definitely going to go there now, if not just to spite this guy who got all snooty with me over his marginally superior piercing methods.  Bottom line, if they can't pierce with studs then they can't pierce with studs.  But his attitude over the whole thing left a very sour taste in my mouth, and I don't think I'd ever go back to get anything else pierced.  He was very snooty and condescending about the whole thing, and went out of his way to scare the bejeezus out of me about going to the mall, which I think was unnecessary.

This restaurant does indeed have a problem with general cleanliness.  However, the food was really good and so I'd probably still go back.  My friend and I spent about $10 each for one of the family dinners...and let me tell you, it was an enormous amount of food!  It even included a whole lobster, which was really tasty.  You will see most of the seafood chillin in the tanks when you first walk in, so you know it's at least freshly killed.  However, like the other reviewers I can't give this more than 2 stars since the place is so filthy.  In all seriousness, the service was friendly but I had to keep kicking a cockroach away with my foot during dinner.  Honestly, these guys could dominate the local market for traditional chinese dining if they'd just clean up a little and spend more than five dollars on the interior decor.  All the handwritten signs all over the walls advertising prices on fresh "geo ducks" and shrimp, along with the harsh fluorescent lighting, are just over-the-top carelessness.

This really is the only gay bar you could take your mother to (although I don't know why you'd want to go drinking with your mom), or any of your straight friends.  It's tame, it looks classy, and it's pretty much the opposite of the seediness and lameness that your straight friends probably expect out of a gay bar.  Just don't go on any day other than friday or saturday, or you're probably gonna walk right in the middle of a drag show (too often at this bar in my opinon).  The inside bar is cool if you can get a seat, but tends to be too loud if you aren't drunk yet.  The back patio is my favorite area when the weather is nice...you can watch the crowd and videos and hang out with larger groups of friends.  The Miami dance club is a little pointless; it's too small to actually dance, and is a really awkward space that would probably make a better lounge.  The bottom line is that Amsterdam is a great place to start out the evening on a Saturday, then head to Burn for some dancing later in the evening (it's close enough to walk from here) and let loose.  If it's just you and a bunch of straight friends (or conservative gay friends), stay here.

A lot has already been said about the food here, and I don't think I have much more to add.  However, in my opinon Delux makes a huge mistake...since when was it cool to take away everyone's privacy?  I went here with a client, and was almost afraid to say anything confidential because the next patrons over were only about 6 inches from my face!  Ok, they weren't that close but it felt like it.  At one point the woman next to me actually chimed in on a comment I made to my client about the drink I was having!  I think it's arrogant for Delux to think their food is so good that everyone will gladly sit on each other's laps in order to wolf down a marginally creative burger.  The bottom line is that you shouldn't come here if you want one shred of privacy to talk with your companions.  If you're alone however, this might be the perfect place to make some friends!

This is one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to in the area.  I used to go more often because their prices were very reasonable (around 8-9 dollars per entree), but they have recently jacked up their pricing a few bucks.  It's still worth it, and you save some money by being able to bring your own wine (they charge a small cork fee).  The convenience store next door sells a few different varieties of chianti - which seems out of place in the dingy corner store, but they know what they're doing.

I think this place really exceeds at doing what they set out to do.  The gelato tastes great, the presentation is gorgeous, and the staff always seems very accommodating and friendly.  I only give it 4 stars because the location doesn't really seem convenient enough for me to go as often as I'd like - the parking can be difficult, and it is not walking distance from very many night spots.  If this were in downtown Scottsdale, Tempe, or Phoenix it would be perfect.  1/22/08 Update - I'm increasing my rating to 5 stars since they have since opened up new locations, one of them being Old Town Scottsdale.

I was at Myst Nightclub in Scottsdale last night to see ATB.  ATB was awesome, but this review is not about ATB - it's about Myst.  My friend and I got tickets online for the show, and when we showed up at the door at around 10pm we waited in line to get in.  The doorman let people in just a couple at a time, very slowly.  And when it was finally just us inline, he made us wait several more minutes.  He was about to let us in when he saw us holding our tickets, and then directed us to another entrance.  After we were inside the club, we were surprised to see virtually nobody in there.  Why were we made to wait at the door?  Are clubs really still trying this cheesy trick to make the club seem busier and more exclusive?  Once inside, we ordered vodka/redbulls.  The flyer for the event said that they were $4 all night; we were charged $10 each.  The bartender denied the special existed.  So we looked on some of the tables, saw the flyers scattered around everywhere - and realized that the flyer said "$4 redbull vodkas all night in Ballroom."  Ah, so we were mistaken and needed to go into the ballroom and order our drinks.  For our next round, we went in the ballroom and ordered a new round of redbull/vodkas; we were charged $10 each again.  The bartender told us the flyer was a misprint.  We grabbed one of the flyers from a nearby table and expressed surprise that it could be a misprint and asked to talk to his manager.  He actually had the nerve to grab the flyer from us and attempt to hide it and ignore our request for a manager.  We didn't order any more drinks that night.  Honestly, I'm surprised that such a well known club in Scottsdale would display such amateurish and ethically suspect behavior.

Let me just start off by saying that I am NOT straight, but I did go here once on a friday.  There were a bunch of hipsters with their shirts on...that's cool, I'm down with that.  I was there with my straight bros from work, and they seem to have a lot of fun so I thought I'd check things out.  After I went around the room telling everyone I'm gay, I ordered a drink from the bar.  I measured the percentage of alcohol in the drink with my portable alcohol meter, and it was 0.2% more than the gay bars I usually go to, but that's cool...nothing wrong with that.    But was the female bartender checking me out?  Probably...so I told her I'm gay and that this chick was barking up the wrong tree!  That irritated look on her face told me she was disappointed.  Just to make sure, I made out with my boyfriend in front of her to make sure she knows I'm seriously gay.  Overall, it was a nice crowd, and I tried dancing for awhile without moving my arms like everyone else was doing.  Weren't they hot with all those clothes on?  But it's cool, not that there's anything wrong with that.  BUT SERIOUSLY, I poke fun because a lot of reviews are written by people who are uncomfortable with the fact that this club is mostly gay on the weekends.  But forget all that, because if you leave your discomfort and attitude at the door I guarantee you will have a good time.  Burn is just about the best thing to happen to the Phoenix club scene in a long time.  You will not find any of the attitude that the Scottsdale clubs are famous for, and the music is always good.  This is the club to go to when you want to dance, because the dance floor takes up almost the entire club.  But don't worry because there's a lounge area and an outdoor patio if you just wanna hang and talk.

Um yeah, I don't care how tall the condos are, or how many chain restaurants/stores they put here, it smells.  I was here on 9/16 and I couldn't believe the sewage smell was still there after all this time.  Get it together, Scottsdale.

Tangible Tanning is one of my favorite local Phoenix businesses.  As you can probably tell, I try to stay tan.  Tangible is one of the few tanning salons I've used that isn't an overall annoying experience.  In fact, I actually enjoy going a few days a week.  I've had a monthly unlimited tanning membership here for over a year now.  The space is very modern and clean, and if you didn't know better you might think you were walking into an art gallery (they do sell the art that's displayed on the walls).  Clayton, who works the front counter, is just about the nicest guy in the world and presents a great face to this business.  I am always greeted by name and he always seems willing to do whatever he can to help to help me pick out a lotion, understand upgrade pricing, or decide on a bed type and duration to use.  The beds themselves are modern, clean and seem to always have new bulbs installed.  Towels are always available, along with eye goggles that are free for use (I used to take this for granted until I tried a couple salons in L.A. that didn't offer them).  There are plenty of lotions to choose from, and if you buy some here you can keep it behind the counter for when you come in (another feature I used to take for granted until realizing this is not a common offering at salons).  Tangible also owns Tangible fitness next door, an equally gorgeous space that houses a fitness gym.  I haven't tried this gym yet, but plan to try it soon and return with my review.  My mantra is that there are so few businesses anymore that really excel at what they set out to do, and Tangible Tanning is one of them.

This is one of those rare places where I have been disappointed a few times, but still want to come back and try it again in the future.  Honestly, I think this place is just taking a bit longer than normal to get going and come into its own.  I was here twice -  once in the evening when it was totally dead (just me and 3 friends), and once for lunch where it was relatively full but not crowded.  Both times the service was really awkward.  Although I had different wait staff each time, on both occasions I or a companion made requests that went unheard - forcing us to be a little more aggressive than usual about getting their attention.  Is it bad accoustics?  Because the place isn't really that hectic, even during what is probably their busiest time of day.  The food is ok, but it's a lot like Fez and Ticoz in that they stick with offering several variations on just a few select types of dishes.  However, I like that they offer some casual and light choices like a fruit and cheese plate - perfect if you're just hanging out for awhile with friends or clients.  I've also had a salad and a sandwich here, although I can't remember which ones (they were not bad, but obviously forgettable).  The prices are reasonable, but the decor is cheap - so even without getting/tasting the food you already know they're fair.    Overall, I think I'd wait a few months to see if they're still in business, and then recommend another visit.  1/22/08 Update - I went back with friends two weeks ago to find the menu and service greatly improved, so I'm upgrading to 4 stars.

I was here on a friday about 2 months ago, and I have to say I was really disappointed.  When did it start being cool to spend no more than five dollars on opening up a new club?  I have a couple bucks, should I start one?  Honestly, the place was tacky...and I get that that's its thing, but come on.  There were a bunch of girls dancing on the small (way smaller than it looks in pictures) dirty disco floor, who looked like total posers with their thrift store dresses and inappropriate enthusiasm.    I came here wanting to like it, and have a new place to hang, but I'm not sure I'll go back.  The whole thing had the feel of a last minute  ill-themed frat party (seriously not unlike some of my own in college), and I'm not sure how that contributes to the Phoenix club scene.

I have been going to this training gym for about 4 weeks, and quite satisfied with the value, results and staff.  I joined the "body transformation program" which means that I go for training 3 times a week, and have nutritional counseling available as needed.  The trainers gave me some forms that I use to log my food intake each day, and once per week give me feedback on my diet and what I should continue and change.  From what I can tell there are 3 trainers at this gym, my trainer is Scott.  I don't have a whole lot to say since I've only been going for 4 weeks, but I did pay for another month and feel like they are meeting my expectations.
