This is my favorite OSF location! The historic downtown location (coupled with ghost story rumors) makes for a fun and #TBT experience! The staff here are always friendly, professional, and prompt. I love coming here!

This IHOP has a lot of opportunity to make up. They've been working at it, but the last few times I've been here, they have either been short staffed or too busy that we would be sitting at the table idly waiting for our food or the check or a straw.

4 stars because the staff are always helpful and willing to help. 1 star left off due to lack of "one-plus-one" monitoring. The Lead always seems to walk around fast talking on their radio, but no additional registers opened.

Best experience I have had. I've spent soc years looking for a barber that not only provided the level of service i needed, but one that had the "barber shop" feel to it. Every time I would find one, the barber would transfer elsewhere, but then I found this one. Walking in after work, Boris took me in and gave me a cut. I wasn't expecting the hot towel, straight edge, or even to like my cut (been so desensitized by Supercuts), but it's safe to say that I'll call this "home" and come for as long as they have an "open" sign.

I found ALC by way of my insurance search engine looking for a new Chiropractor. I went in for a consult and immediately loved the environment. Dr. Morley saw me immediately and gave me an adjustment. He was forthright and transparent about my medical needs and billing options. Saw me right away the next day for an adjustment and is just wonderful.

It's been a long time since I've enjoyed living at a complex! I've had my share of moving after my lease is up. Suffice it to day, apartment living is a lot like car insurance - my loyalty lies in the cheapest bidder. Camden has changed all that (like Allstate has in the example). I've gone from budget loyal to brand loyal. Camden has much of the luxury updates that have been boasted by other complexes in the last few years, but what sets them apart is their green campaign, management style, and (most importantly) their resident engagement. Every month or so, there's a resident event in the Welcome Center. Couple that with their quarterly visits for maintenance items like filters and water heaters, Camden is a place that I really enjoy living. The granite counter tops, "smart" washer and dryer units, and "fetch" fixtures, this place is the best. I love the staff, they always wave high reminding me of those old southern backroads as a kid. Oh, an the trash valet service! I never liked taking the trash out as a kid and now I don't have to!

Always take care of my Jack whenever it's time for his shots or it he catches a cold. I've seen some negative reviews on here and NextDoor, but the truth is, it's all about expectations. They put all of the billing information out on the table, it's up to the owner to accept care. The quality quality of care is excellent and even in an emergency situation, they set the expectation of how much the admission will cost.

Took me a while to find a staff member to help make a key copy. Location seemed to be short staffed. After which, I stood at the self check out where a screen seemed to have been frozen. I pressed for help, but the monitoring cashier was on the phone with who seemed to be a co-worker. A customer returned to the screen I was waiting on to finished his transaction (which was frozen) and I was then directed to another station when he and I experienced a short stand off. 2 stars for customer experience at the hand of staff.

Kona's new re-brand at this location gave it that extra "umph" to take it to the next level. I've always been a huge fan of Kona Grill and this location has got it all. Food, Service, and overall experience. The employees here really pride themselves in their work and their interactions with guests. It's great to see the leaders not just walk around and ask how everything is, but roll up their sleeves and serve a plate or clear a table. Great job, @konagrill !

Not much to write here. I always park on the Sears (upper level) side when I visit Chandler mall. My last visit to the mall, I ended up buying a luggage set on sale at Sears. The cashier was helpful and even checked to see if all four pieces were present (I didn't even think to, LOL). Four stars. No negative feedback to report.

Four stars because the manager (Rob) retired and unsure of the future of this location. We used to come here at least once a week and the service, staff, and environment was everything we came to expect and love of Johnny Rockets. We will miss Rob, but will still keep the dream alive.

Until we discovered Sun Asian, we were going to Pan Asia down the street. Sun Asian is fast, friendly, and has GREAT food. They are very attentive and friendly. They always have our lunches out quickly as they are conscious of our time crunch. Very good lunch specials and much less expensive than the alternative.

I attended the show of "Dames at Sea" and loved the experience. It's a little small and intimate, but there's no bad seat in the house! Once the show lets out, though, the streets get a little crowded so plan your exit strategy when you're parking.

Absolutely my most favorite restaurant ever. I reserve it for special occasions, but when I do go, the service is 5 out of 5. The entrees are portioned just right and the presentation is wonderful. The overall atmosphere is calm, cool, and collected. There is not too much excitement that is distracting nor is it quiet as a library.

My first trip to my local TJ's proved AWESOME! Jeff is a great, energetic cashier and is always able and willing to help. For example, I once grabbed a thing of Roma Tomatoes and when we rang it up, we found they had spoiled. Without question or contest, he tossed them out and ran and grabbed me a new container. 5 stars all the way!

The new Fork and Screen is awesome! Being able to lounge at the full bar out front and then go in and have dinner...well, it doesn't get better than that! Keep it classy, not trashy, NCM...and they did an awesome job making this my newest obsession!

Not a fan. Local organizations (Apollo Group, US Airways, Intel) converge on this location making it a difficult experience. If you do go on a weekend night, be ready to navigate that small parking lot.

My most recent visit, has left me questioning the professionalism of this local establishment. During which, while Samara my cashier took my order, I observed two individuals in plain clothes walk behind the counter, passed her and three other employees, to what appeared to be the 1st drive thru window.  Whether or not they are current employees bears no bearing to individuals walking through the kitchen who have no pressing business to do so. In the professional environment, perception is huge and this perception is not positive at all.  After having gathered my food, and finished eating it, I observed a gentlemen place and pick up his order, walk towards the restrooms and turned around and placed his food on the counter to walk back to where the first two individuals went to. This lessened my experience that now three plain clothes individuals would casually walk behind the scenes (where my and other patron's food is prepared).  One star seems appropriate, but I'll give two assuming this was an isolated incident. Won't be going back for a while, though.

I'm a off-on-off-again gym attendee, but Life Time really is gold standard. Member services is always friendly upon entering. Towel and available lockers is great for a pre- or post- work workout. It's a little pricey for me, but for what you get, I think it's a fair price. Always clean equipment and facilities.

Certainly one of my favorites AMCs! The environment and interior of the theater is most certainly not conveyed by its exterior. On the outside, it looks like any other AMC, but once you walk inside it's a totally different experience. Very modern and inviting. The box office is inside so there's no "putting your face to the window to see show times" complete with the kiosks to the right. The concession stand signage is all digital and reminded me of the Dine-in AMC near the Biltmore. AMC has been doing a great job re-branding and it shows in the Westgate location. The service was a little slow on a Saturday at the concession stand, but nothing to complain over. Just like any other AMC, make sure you get there in enough time to get your snacks and find a seat. Good job, AMC!

I absolutley love Floyd's! I've had Starlyn and Tasha and both gals took what I asked and blew me away! As for haircuts are concerned, it's hard to have someone mess up my hair. I mean, 6 & 8...pretty easy to do. Even if someone did mess it up, it grows back. But these gals take my boring usual and make it into something fun and hip. Tasha's been great at recommending product which has been a challenge for me in the past. In terms of price, I'd say it's pretty fair for a cut and a wash. It's no high-end expensive, joint, but then again, when does a hair cut need to be!? The staff are very friendly and actively engaged with you during your session. I love the songs on the exclusive radio station they have along with the LP nostalgia all over the walls! So fun!

Love Kristine, Megan, and Nick! They know our "usual" and always make time to come by and say hi. Not just say hi, though. They ask how our week was, what's new...they take a general interest in us which is refreshing to experience from the normal bar atmosphere. It's dog friendly so be sure to bring your four-legged friend!

Clean Freak is awesome, cost effective, and convenient. The associates are always smiling, assisting, and working with urgency in a manner that is to the customer's best interest. The wash itself is about 3 minutes, but covers all my needs from tires to the top of the car either through the tunnel or the post-wash bays with vacuums and air compressors. The logistics of it, though, are a little less to be desired. You exit into the street where customers are trying to enter and some enter the wrong drive way; just a little too close quarters for me.

I absolutely love The Old Spaghetti Factory, but this location disappointed me sorely. Granted, we came in an hour before closing - I'll give them that. I felt rushed and neglected throughout this entire dining experience, with the exception of being seated. We waited an unusual amount of time before our drink order was given and when we ordered our food, the server seemed very hurried. When our salad/soup came, we had no place settings or silverware and had to wait until someone passed by. It just seemed very rushed and hurried. 2 stars, since this location not only fell short of expectations, but when it comes to best in its class, other locations were so much better.

Oreganos! Let's be honest, anything less than 5 stars is an outright lie! I make a visit to this location maybe once a month or so and love every minute of the visit. My only "complaint" is no reflection on the establishment itself, just the parents in need of a refresher course on how to raise their children; unruly or running around the patio as if this was a playground, but again, this is on the parents...not Oreganos.  I'm not one to try new menu items, I tend to play it safe, but I recently transitioned from the Bollo Pasta to the Rigatoni and OMG! To DIE FOR! Dylan is a great server! We look forward to seeming him each time we visit!

I was brought here by my team at work and was truthfully afraid I'd starve (I'm not a vegetarian). The environment was fun and inviting and I ordered the "Big Wac" and would you know, it was much better than the Big Mac! Five stars because this place is truly awesome!  Caution on parking, though, there's not much of it and a lot of people don't seem to know how to negotiate the lot.

I've not patroned Vanity for its stylists specifically, but I can say with confidence that these fine professionals know what they are doing! I've personally recommended Vanity to a close working friend and she was simply amazed with the incredible service and outcome of her blowout. In my interactions with the team, I can tell there is a genuine passion for what they come to work for each day - not to style, but change lives. As a frequent secret shopper (not here, of course :) ), I can tell genuine passion from "all the rest".  I visit Vanity, however, for Beverly their beyond-words-amazing Massage Therapist (for lack of a more awesome title!). Beverly's the "real deal". I've tried them all - the mom & pop's at the mall, the guys who come out of nowhere for a free 10-minute, and even Massage Envy for a spell. I can say that Beverly does much more than help overall stress, tension, and circulation; she knows exactly what needs to be done for each visit. Her Signature Massage will leave you wanting to fall asleep and I have - and I'm a horrible snorer! In the 3 visits I've had with her, she's done more good than 3 years worth of Massage Envy!   She is a perfect addition to the Vanity team and, ladies, let's be honest who wouldn't want a massage and blowout all in the same day! Make a day of it!

Having studied photography in school, I have worked with a lot of photographers on both sides of the camera, but Vintaged Rabbit has really set herself apart from all the rest! Sharon's talent is neither something that can be learned in a classroom nor something that can it be taught! After a session with my sisters, Sharon really proved her talent and skill. Our session (http://vintagedrabbitphotography.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/jurgens-family/) really captured the 4 of us both as a family and as individuals. Personally, I favor shots that aren't posed and Sharon captured that perfectly. Thus, showing my sisters and I in our true sense as individuals (and "dysfunction") and that a bond between siblings that was once described as "invisible" is actually displayed in and through us all! Any person can grab a camera and snap moments, but it takes a really talented artist like Sharon that can capture memories that easily slip away in the spaces of our minds. My living room is littered with canvases of our one shoot with my siblings and I look forward to my future photography needs with Sharon and the Vintaged Rabbit brand!

Let's be honest. The spread of 1 stars and 5 stars on The Perch is common for a new establishment. The 1 stars here dwell on the opportunities (service deficiencies) and lack any celebration of great service. Any place will have it's balance of these and it's own speed bumps early on, so ease up.   As a mystery shopper, I can attest that The Perch has a fantastic atmosphere, great staff, and an overall delivery model that is unique and classy - definitely a GREAT touch for the DC area. There is honest opportunity present with the staff learning the changing menu; I've been here a number of times and have seen it updated. This is common and expected, but it would behoove the staff to be briefed on the changes.   The food was great and on reading other reviews about the food, service, or cleaniness, I can't really see where they're coming from. The Perch isn't filthy nor is the food or service "that bad" to what the "1 star-ers" are saying.  I urge new patrons to come try The Perch. Though, it's been a little crowded when I've come, I look forward to sitting on the roof next time! The birds, the live music, the slight breeze...all make for a very pleasant atmosphere. 4 stars all the way; -1 star only because there may be 1 or 2 things to improve on, but if I could, I'd say 4.99999 stars!
