Went to the one on Central. Chips/salsa average, tacos average, mango margarita decent, slow unfriendly service, decor ok.  Not sure I'd go back, nothing special about this place.

New Steeler bar in old town!! Great drink specials, food, service, & crowd!! We tried everything from the Bloody Mary served w/ a slider & wing, to the burgers, steaks, fries, & potstickers were all awesome!! I highly suggest you go, whether you're a Steeler fan or not. They've great food & drink specials on a daily basis. Holy Spirits is the real deal!!
