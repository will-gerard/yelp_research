Love this place, the best house salad and you get a bonus croissant, yummy! I have yet to have something on the menu that wasn't great! And the service is always on point!

I go here for the Chile Con Carne, it's hot and every meal comes with chips & 4 different salsas, plus sopaipillas... What? No complaints here

I would only give this place one star but the service is good so yeah. Back in the day they had fajitas on the lunch menu, but with that gone the menu sucks! That is all.

Simply sandwiches, they may have other stuff on the menu but I would never know because I can't get past the super Sicilian & the turkey. AWESOME!

Really good Mexican food, check. Cold beers, check. Good margs, check! A little scary outside, sure but my friends that's where you will always find the best Mexican food!

Just went for an early Valentines dinner, the place is amazing! The service was great, we had two servers so every request was met. The food is really good, but it's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. The food is a bit pricy, but you're paying for the experience. The wine list is great, and reasonably priced. The best part, by far is being able to see the birds eye view of Phoenix, Awesome!

First things first The Blue Adobe Grille is a New Mexican food joint not to be confused with Mexican food- totally different! I love both, but there is something about the heavy influence of ancho & green chili that drives me back again and again! I have been multiple times and yet to a bad experience, even when I had a bad experience! Confused? Let me clear air-    Headed out on the town one evening with wifey, we decide to start the night @ Blue Adobe. We started off with a few drinks and then placed our order, few more drinks down the hatch. The waitress walks by and tells us just about 5 mins left, cool no prob! 5 mins more she comes by apologizes and tells us more mins, um ok. Next thing you know, there's a loud argument in the kitchen and the owner (who has been bussing tables, playing hostess, & well just all out helping her staff) comes to the table and tells us the cooks lost our order, What???? She then apologizes and tells us our plates are next and tells us dinner is on her. Ok that's cool, we have all been there and any place with tact will do that, but we've been drinking and as we all know that adds up quick especially with shots! So when we get the bill, she had taken care of everything, I was shocked, she had come back by several times to apologize and thank us for coming in. That was the only bad experience we've had and it still turned out awesome! A owner that cares about the customer+ class + great food = a 5 star great place to eat!

My favorite movie theater- always clean, movies cost more therefor you typically won't find ghetto people( on the phone, talking LOUD, or just plain rude) there! Love it, the best way to see a flick!

Really good Greek food, very nice owner, great prices. They're only missing one thing- Sriracha sauce, the second they have it I will add the 5th star. Until then I'll keep loading the goods in a plastic bag and bring it with me.

One of the best slice's in town. JimmyJoe sauce is delicious and free! The wings are really good, need to add some more flavors but good things will come in time. This just maybe my favorite pizza place, but It's on the fence with Venezia's pizza. Well it's  worth the stop!

This is the first time Yelp has failed me! Out of 10 reviews this places has 5 stars, the only way that is possible is to have 10 friends and/or family members writing the reviews. First off, to make good burgers you should have fresh meat, not frozen patty's. Second, if you are going to squirt some random sauce on the "Western Burger" you might want to make sure it's good or even comes close to BBQ sauce. Third, the bread, toast it, heat it up, do something to hide the fact you that have stale buns. NOT GOOD! And for those of you who gave this place 5 stars, go one more block up the street and try a "Real Fresh Burger" ! There is a Five Guys, or a Fuddruckers, even the Sonic right around the corner has better burgers and dogs.

How do I love this place, 10 years ago I stopped by one in  Albuquerque,NM- I went nuts, there was nothing like it in AZ. I went out and bought a smoker just so I could have something like it, came really close too. But really who has 16 hours to smoke brisket, yeah me either. And now it has arrived: So here's the low down, the brisket is Awesome, hands down awesome! Pulled pork and green chili stew are great! Chicken & links are really good too but I don't  go for the ribs, not my favorite!  All in all great smokehouse!
