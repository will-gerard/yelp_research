I noticed that alot of the negative reviews were outdated and someone mentioned in the review that the office was in south scottsdale. This review is for my 2/25/15 visit at the north scottsdale office off of Scottdale road and 101. I asked the office staff if there was another location and this is the only Entegrity ENT in Scottsdale, so here goes.   I was here last year as a new patient and my experience has been positive, so i have returned this year for another condition i was suffering from.    I saw Dr. Samuel Bailey both times and he has great bedside manners with positive energy and always smiling.  I hate grouchy doctors :P He answered all of my questions and i didn't feel like i was being rushed. Most doctors offices usually have their PA or NPs do all the work and doctors will only see you for 5 minutes tops but Dr. Bailey gave me his full attention and was super friendly,  and kind.  He explained things easy and thoroughly enough for a child to understand AND still had time for my questions.   I have not seen other doctors here, so i can't speak for them but Dr. Bailey has been one of the kindest, caring and considerate physician I've dealt with and i highly recommend him for all your ear/nose/throat needs.   As for the office staff,  they must have new staff because nobody at this office treated me bad like some of the things that were mentioned in other negative reviews.  Many doctors offices want the patients to pay up front if you haven't met your annual deductible but Entegrity will file a claim with your insurance first before they bill you,  so i don't agree with some of the reviews complaining about the office only wanting money.    Bottom line;  if you need to see an ENT specialist and want to see a doctor that will actually listen and pay attention to you explaining your symptoms who is very kind and caring, then schedule your appointment with Dr. Bailey. You won't like him if you're one of those people who don't like nice and friendly doctor (trust me,  i know some people who prefer their doctors to be a$$holes).

Good,  fast,  and reasonably priced Chinese food. We ordered house fried rice,  house lo mein, orange chicken,  and crab wonton.  Very fresh and delicious.  Plenty of leftover for later :) will most definitely return.

I used to go to Happy Bowl in Tempe (Baseline and Rural) in the 90's and they had the best udon. I used to go eat their udon at least once a week during my high school years.   After graduating, I moved on with my life and naturally forgot about this place.   Then I found this place one day and i discovered that it was owned by the same owner as happy bowl! I hadn't seen him in almost 20 years but the udon was just as great as i remember.  Thick plump noodles and yummy broth.   If you're looking for some decent bowl of udon noodle,  i highly recommend this restaurant.

I like Scottdale nails.  I've been going there for about couple, maybe 3 years now. I've tried other nail shops from time to time when I get coupons in the mail but I always end up coming back here.  I've only had one bad experience here where I just walked in and they just assigned me whoever was available at the time.  She was an older lady who hardly trimmed my cuticles and painted the gel too thick.  Two things i look forward to the most when i get my nails done are natural looking painted nails and neatly trimmed cuticles but it wasn't the case that time.  But it was just that one time and i don't think that lady works there anymore,  all the other times I've been there,  I'm usually happy with their job.  Mary is by far the best they have and she speaks good English,  so it makes the time more enjoyable being able to converse with someone about various topics while getting my nails done (she's also good at recommending good eateries in town) but she's ALWAYS booked,  so you have to make an appointment way ahead of time if you want her. Mimi and sofia are also good and many other nail technicians that I don't know the names to... The facility is clean, inviting, lots of magazines to read and the staff is professional.  Bring cash for gratuity as you can't add tips if you're paying credit or debit.

This place wasn't very good.  We ordered about 50 bucks worth of food.  I always look forward to having chinese leftover but not this time.  We ate some because we were hungry but ended up throwing away more than half of it. Hot and sour soup tasted off. All meat (beef in fried rice, chicken in lo mein, pork in sweet and sour pork) were extremely dry and not seasoned. Crab rangoon was ok. Eggroll didn't taste good.  Took one bite and tossed the rest.  House fried rice tasted underseasoned.   Bottom line,  we tossed the to-go menu along with the leftover and will not be ordering from this place again.

I came here with my coworkers for lunch couple times and i was satisfied both times.  One of my coworkers actually recommended this place for serving Korean style chirashi bowl.  It did not disappoint. Very generous portion (more than enough for two to share. We ordered chirashi bowl/udon lunch combo) with a TON, I mean A TON of assorted sashimi in that bowl! Wow so much fresh fish, every bite was heaven. The server wasn't too friendly but the service was fast which is pretty much the most important thing during lunch hour.

Been coming to saigon nites for several years and we have no complaints.  The owners are very courteous to their regulars and the food is great.  I may not know authentic vietnamese cuisine but their food tastes good to me and that's all that matters.  Their thai ice tea is super delicious. It is so good with a hot bowl of steak pho :)   As long as Saigon nites stays in business, we will be coming back.

My general dentist had referred me to Dr. Mclammy and after the first root canal treatment, i thought I'd never see him again but I've had a misfortune of needing 2 more root canals in less than 2 years. I was actually happy to be seeing Dr.  Mclammy again. He's funny, kind and most of all,  a very good endodontist.  The office is equipped with state of the art gear and Dr. Mclammy is an experienced dentist who really knows his stuff. Administrative staff will work with your insurance and also very kind.  The office is conveniently located and very nice (good furniture,  good lighting,  very welcoming, comfortable environment).  Everyone at North Scottsdale endodontist is very caring, kind,  and accommodates patient's need. All three of my root canal treatments were as painless as they could be and i highly recommend this place for all your root canal therapy needs.

I went to circle K to get gas and saw this place and thought I'd give this place a try.  Large pizza; half supreme and half Hawaiian ran for about $23 and some change,  tax included.  We were  very very hungry,  so it may have tasted better than it actually is. Whatever the case,  we were happy with how the pizza tasted and the consistency of the dough. Marinara sauce was yummy. Ton of toppings.    I will try the wings next time.

This place is gem. I'm so happy we found this place! Exactly the type of pizza we were craving.  Their food is BOMB! Antipasto salad is loaded, marinara sauce is so flavorful and the pizza... THE PIZZA!!! BOMB!! We ordered 18 in but can't wait to try the ultimate 24 in pizza. It'll be humongous piece of heaven.  Will be returning to this place for sure.  So so yummy.

!!! They have very good jja jang myun. I justed recently started coming here but i recognized the owner lady right away when i first set foot in this restaurant.  She used to run a smaller chinese joint that sold jja jang myun many years ago in mesa off of alma school and baseline. I remember driving 30 miles to satisfy my jja jang myun craving back then. First time in 10+years,  i had jja jang myun (korean style Chinese noodle wuth black bean sauce) in arizona made by same owner from that restaurant i used to go to all those years ago.  Jja jang myun was just as delicious as before.

I lived in Arizona for 20 years and tried several Asian hair dresser during those years since I have not been able to find a good American salon who knows how to properly cut Asian hair. Ever since I first visited Helens hair several years ago, I haven't been going to any other places for my haircut needs.  I don't mind the 30 mile drive from where I live to get the kind of cut I want. Not to mention the cheap price! She does Way better job than 60+ dollar scottsdale hair salons in my opinion. Helen is also a very kind, dedicated, and honest devoted Christian person, she will never overcharge or add hidden fees and willing to fix if you're not happy with the style for some reason. She would always offer refreshment and if I happen to go during breakfast or lunch time,  she would even offer food.  Maybe she does because I've been a regular customer for so many years but the bottom line is she really knows how to cut and style my hair in a very efficient manner. I've been to many different Korean and other Asian hair dressers in the valley in the past and Helen is by far the best and most skilled with her scissors.  Highly recommended.

Agree with the previous reviewer, Mathew L.  Overall,  pretty satisfied.  I've had a misfortune of having to visit here couple times this summer (2014) and the wait time wasn't  very long both times. I thought the staff was attentive and friendly unlike previous reviews (but those reviews were from 2+ years ago, so they must have new staff) and i was seen by the PA or NP in timely manner.   They have additional diagnostic tools such as xray equipment unlike some of the other urgent cares I've been to. It's conveniently located close to 101 and shea.

Better donuts than DD, especially the glazed.  Also love the donut holes.  Only 99 cents a dozen!  I personally only had the glazed donuts but I'm told by my family that their fruit filled donuts are also very good.  More filling than DD. Service is friendly and price is good. They also have drive-thru Window.

We came here on Monday morning after a search for brunch place in the neighborhood.  This place was close by and had good reviews,  so we decided to give it a try.  Our server Sydney provided fast and friendly service. The restaurant was quite busy but our server provided timely service and checked up on us regularly. Vanilla Latte was delicious. we ordered gravy Benedict and wild berry cakes and both were beautifully plated in generous portion and were very tasty.  Great way to start a week.  Will definitely return.

This place is not so great.  The nurse practitioner spent no more than one minute with me and prescribed something that didn't even work and I ended up gong to ENT a month later for the same issue that had turned into a chronic issue.  They're also trying to sell some kinda weight loss program that is not covered by the insurance.

Ever since they opened this location, we've been coming here regularly. We usually order same things but sometimes we try different things here and there. And so far everything has been really tasty. Italian beef is delicious, onion rings are crunch, and crinkle fries are just perfectly seasoned. Tried a strawberry malt it's really really delicious. Their chocolate cake is the bomb too.

Overall,  good experience.  We went there on Saturday around 1 pm and the hostess told us eta wait time of 15 minutes. The place was full and there was only one other party waiting before us.  We waited for about 20 minutes and our table was ready. I've been to boiling crab in cali several times,  so I was familiar with the drill but my party wasn't.  Our server Jazzmin right away asked us if this was our first time and kindly explained the drill and thoroughly went over each item on the menu and how much we should order.  We ordered half dozen oysters,  assorted shrimp (half lb Louisiana spicy,  pound hot and juicy mild,  and lemon pepper baby spice), corn,  and a catfish basket in case my girl doesn't like the spices on shrimp.  I'm not a huge fan of crawfish, so we skipped that.  When I visit my family in cali,  we always go to boiling crab and one of my favorite things is to order raw oysters as an appetizer before I start devouring my shrimp, so naturally I was looking forward to getting my Oyster first. I even asked the server if they could bring out the oysters before anything else and after she went to check with the kitchen and told us that it couldn't be done. I could've sworn oysters were on appetizer menu.... Anyway,  The first thing they brought out was the lemon pepper shrimp.  My daughter who can't eat spicy seasoning started digging in. Shortly after,  they started  bringing out other shrimp but still no oysters.  I asked the server if we could have our oysters asap as we ordered them for appetizer and she said she'd go check with the kitchen. She came back and told us oysters were still not ready.  By the time we were almost done with our shrimp,  they brought out the catfish basket.  The fish was hot, fresh,  and juicy and the side of sweet potato fries were also fresh.  My girl really like the lemon pepper shrimp,  so we ordered another pound and it came out reasonably quickly.  We were getting too full to finish the extra order of shrimp,  so we asked for a box.  By the time our server brought the box,  we were totally stuffed.  By this time, STILL no oysters.  It's not like our server forgot to put in my order,  she kept on checking with the kitchen every 5 minutes and I don't even know what the hold up was.  We ended up canceling our oysters but of course by the time another server brought our check,  we were still charged for the oysters. So additional 10 minutes or so spent unnecessarily to have the oysters taken out of my check.    Anyway overall everyone in my party was satisfied with the flavor and the amount of food ordered. I was bummed out about not getting my oysters and that's why I give 4 stars but by the time we were done,  I was so satisfactorily full,  it didn't bother me that much that I didn't get my appetizer.  People started pouring in by the time we were leaving  (around 2:30 pm on Saturday) so I think we made it just in time.  Shrimp was plump, seasoning was flavorful (except the Louisiana one.  I mean it was ok but wasn't the best), plenty of drink refill,  our server Jazzmin was attentive,  friendly,  fast,  and knowledgeable,  so overall,  a good experience for us.

We wondered about this place every time we drove by and finally decided to check it out tonight.  The staff was friendly and the service was good but... The sushi was warm and all the plates on the conveyor belt have been rotating even before we got there and most of them were still there until we left (we stayed over an hour). AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.  They never even bothered to replace the older plates no matter how long they've been sitting there rotating at room temperature.  Seaweed salad was been on there for so long,  it was seeping moisture,  looked more like seaweed soup than salad. I was craving yellowtail sashimi but didn't feel like taking the only plate that's been rotating there for who knows how long,  so I ordered fresh plate and the fish came out half frozen.  Plates on rotation are warm and the ones you order come out frozen..  Also it was a bit pricey for the quality and considering it's a revolving sushi bar rather than a traditional sushi restaurant.  (90 bucks Not including gratuity for not so fresh sushi,  I wasn't very happy about that).  I really hate leaving negative reviews but one thing that makes me mad the most is spending decent amount of money for bad quality food.  If I'm gonna spend hundred bucks at a restaurant,  i want to feel satisfied after dining and it wasn't the case this time. I'm very disappointed at this place  since I've been looking forward to check this place out for several weeks. I guess i can stop wondering now. I just hope I don't get sick from eating warm raw seafood. I give 2 stars for friendly service. After i came home,  I immediately came online to see what other people had to say and saw that the restaurant had several health violations. Honesty I'm not shocked... I'm sorry to have to leave negative feedback but this is how I felt after tonight.  I don't think we will be going back unless there's a significant improvement.  Good luck Akita revolving sushi. Seriously...

When it comes to massages, i prefer deep tissue over swedish. After i read other's reviews about thai massage, i decided to give it a try. I booked for myself and my husband.  Bottom line is i love this place and i will most likely to return to this place.  It's a full body massage from head to toe and you're completely relaxed and energized after an hour.  And the price is insane.

Noticed this place couple weeks ago while i was walking my dog and thought it looked interesting but never had the pleasure to try their ice cream until yesterday when i received coupon in the mail.  I had a  coupon for buy one get one free. I ordered large size to go in with the coupon I received another large size for free. Large size included three scoops of either ice cream or gelato. I ordered strawberry, chocolate, coconut sherbet, and coffee gelato. Strawberry was more on the sour side then creamy, but it was still delicious. Chocolate ice cream was very chocolatey. Coffee gelato was A OK.  Overall, we were satisfied with their quality of ice cream and gelato. We will return especially its in walking distance from our home.

Yay! First! Been going to senor taco in fountain hills and i didn't mind the 25 minute drive because they have the best carne Asada burrito in the valley. However i always wanted them to open one closer to home and they finally did!  It was pretty obvious they have not been open for long. Salsa was fresh,  and burro was delicious but the size was smaller than the ones in fountain hills. Right next to DD, I will be visiting here often :)

Conveniently located in Scottsdale Kierland commons across the street from Scottdale Quarters, they opened a brunch joint Snooze. Loved this place so much in Denver,  we dined here twice during my 3-night stay and i was so excited to see Snooze while taking a saturday morning walk with my starbucks at Scottdale Quarters.  I didnt know they had opened one in Scottsdale.   The place was not very crowded around 7 am on Saturday. Service was a bit on the slow side considering it wasn't that busy but the staff was friendly.  The food is very delicious and the atmosphere is open and inviting.   I love brunch places in Scottsdale  (breakfast club, first watch, butters, over easy etc) and Snooze is a great addition to that list. Definitely worth checking it out. Enjoy!
