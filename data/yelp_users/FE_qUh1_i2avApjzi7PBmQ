I don't even want to spend anymore time thinking about this store.  Only reason I'm writing this review is to make aware of the awful and unpleasant customer service.  If you don't mind waiting ridiculous amounts of time waiting to be helped then this is your place.  Otherwise spend your money elsewhere where fast service is a priority.

This place is super convenient for me.  I work in the same area as this caf√©.  I call in my order and they have it ready for me within five minutes.  I get the French toast with bacon every time.  They even know that I don't like butter so they won't put it in with my meal.  I've never tried lunch or dinner there but the breakfast gets a 4 star with me.   Very friendly staff and good food.   A nice place to bring family and watch planes come in or just grab your meal and leave.

These guys were great at getting my car in for an oil change.  I called them Saturday at 3:30 knowing they close at 4 and asked if I could bring it in.  It wasn't by any means an easy YES but I did get one.  With even still being busy when I arrived, they still managed to get my car in and out.  The reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because when I called in the man was kind of rude.  My wife didn't want to call them in the first place because they were rude to her over the phone on our last oil change.  But we had a coupon for a free oil change so why not try them again.   Fast Service, will be using them in the future and hopefully can bring this up to 5 stars.

Haven't eaten at this location but wouldn't recommend their take out service. Saw one of their drivers down the street from their location smoking a cigarette while some customers food is sitting in the same car. Disgusting.  Save your smoking habits for when you aren't delivering food.

Instead of long lines, sticky floors and disgusting fountain drink areas, these guys are the exact opposite.  Every time I walk in there someone is always cleaning the floors or wiping down the fountain drink area.  I'm always greeted with a "hello" when I walk in the door.  My favorite part is there are no long lines and if there are they are very fast at checking people out so you are out the door in no time.   I definitely recommend this place for your everyday snack needs.

I was an idiot trying to install a new thermostat in my home.  Mike saved us from this AZ heat after I blew a fuse in my furnace.  We called Mike very late in the evening in desperate need of his help.  He was very willing to come out that same night.  He arrived when he said he would and went above and beyond our expectations.  Mike is very personable and knowledgable.  We will definitely be using him again for our AC needs.

I'm always a little hesitant to try new places especially when it comes to Burgers.  For the longest time I thought nothing could compare to other burger joinsts around town, but I was wrong after eating at Smashburger.  I order the Bacon Cheesburger everytime and it's delicious.  Make sure you get their Smash Fries those are delicious as well.   The service is fast.  The give you a number and bring the food to you when it is ready.  They have a few people come around to check on you to make sure you are doing ok. They have outdoor seating as well which Is great for this time of year.   The only thing that irritated me was when placing my order they ask If I would like to donate $1 to an organization.  Don't get me wrong I don't mind donating a dollar here and there.  But when I tell them no not this time they say, "oh man, I just need five more to be done." Talk about putting me on a guilt trip.    Service is great. Food is great.  Will definitely be coming back.

Make sure you check your food if you order to go.  Ordered a chicken avocado club and was surprised with a mushroom chicken burger when I got home.  Disappointed.
