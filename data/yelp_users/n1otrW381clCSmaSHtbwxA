Another example of a very poorly run Cafe Rio. Where are you finding your managers from?! Today's shining example was a manager unwilling to budge and honor the price that their employee offered.   I wanted to try the shrimp tacos, which were on their daily special. I asked specifically if I could order them ala carte like the regular tacos. I was told yes. When I got to the register, they tried to charge me the price of the tacos as a meal. I told them no, I ordered them ala carte. Long story short, they couldn't ring them out that way. Manager refused to honor the price by ringing them out as another type of taco. THEN THE MANAGER WOULD NOT EVEN COME SPEAK WITH ME FACE TO FACE, EVEN AFTER SEVERAL REQUESTS FROM HER STAFF. She just sat in her office and relayed messages to me via her cashier. I asked her staff to ask her if she would rather just lose the sale and waste the food because I wasn't going to purchase them as a meal. Her one word answer, "Yes."  Her blatant disregard for customer service is a shining example of what's broken with Cafe Rio as a Company.   Thank goodness there are plenty of Chipotle's close by, and a couple new Costa Vida's as well. They seem to actually like their customers and and treat them well.   First and last visit to this place!   Hey Cafe Rio higher ups, if you are reading this, it's a bad trend in both of your locations that I've visited. Your managers and staff need more customer service training. In a market that has plenty of competition, with reviews and ratings readily available at our finger tips, it's your service that sets you aside and keeps driving new business in or out of your locations.  ...but what do I know, I'm just a consumer looking for a place to spend my hard earned money.

Best tuner shop in Az, hands down. I've had repairs and tuning sessions here. They have an in house dyno, and dialed in my car reeeeeaaaaalllllll nice.  Best part, they are one of the few places that have an "all wheel" dyno, so they can do cars like WRX's, Evo's, and (for you baller's) GTR's.   If you see some of the builds going on here, you'd be impressed too. Their shop car, an Evo, is sick!   Richard, who runs the front of the house is very knowledgeable and friendly. Anybody who has ever tried to find a good repair shop knows that is rare. It's said, "finding a good mechanic is harder than finding a good doctor". Tony who is always back of house, is a tuning guru. Best part is, he's patient and answered my questions in a way that I could understand.   Pricing was good, especially for a shop of this caliber. Work was done quick. Staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Perfect trifecta.   I highly recommend them.

Good midrange steak house in Gilbert, Az. Better than average customer service, with customary mid to high-end style decor. Good place to take visitors or a date.  I've been here a number of times, seeing as I live just around the corner and don't always want to drive into Phoenix or Scottsdale for a Steak.   As mentioned in other reviews, The Keg is better than many of the other chain steak houses out there, but not on the level of a Steak 44, or Ruth's Chris. I've had the rib eye, prime rib, and a few of their sides.  I've also stopped in for an occasional drink, as they have a full bar with decent bar tenders.    This most recent visit , me and my cousin were waited on by a very bubbly and pleasant young lady. I believe her name was Hollee (name on the receipt), and she put our visit over the top.  She was fun to chat with,  although she did poke some fun at our "old guy drinks." Personally, I will ask for her section again on my next visit.   Progressing through dinner, we start with the salads. I've had the Caesar and the wedge. The Caesar was a bit wilted for my liking, but the wedge was a bit more crisp and enjoyable.   The steaks have a seemingly common steak house style rub, and have always been on point with the temperature that I order. Never over cooked, as I like my steaks medium rare. The prime rib has a flavorful rub, with a basic au jus. Both items have been enjoyable.  Sides are where the chain restaurant kitchen rears its ugly head. The twice baked potato has a good flavor, and is generally my "go to" side, albeit nothing truly epic. The mixed vegetables are just ho hum and rather bland.   I've yet to try any of their desserts, although they do look good. I generally settle for one of their after dinner drinks from the bar (I will update this review, if things change). I do enjoy the Keg Attitude Coffee.  So the final answer..? One of the better places around the San Tan Village Mall. Yes I would recommend it, and I will be back again.

First off, these guys are great.  Now that I've got a chance to say that, I'll tell you my story.  I was referred here after a lifting injury. Most places that I went prior were talking meds and/or surgery instead of "healing".  Dr. Hirst and Dr. Towner both took the time to examine my shoulder and chose a path of adjustment, massage, stretching, and exercises to fix me up. A short period of time later, my shoulder is back to 100% and my posture is better also.   Long story short, if you've suffered an injury or just want to feel better in your day to day,  I recommend this office a lot! The staff is great, and I always feel welcome when I walk in. Heck they even taught me a bunch of new stretches to do prior to my workouts.  Last but not least, they work with my insurance, which gives me peace of mind.  5 stars all the way!

-Update-  A year into eating here, and I still love it. I even upped the score from 4 to 5 stars. Such a nice alternative , while living in the chain restaraunt hell that is SE Gilbert, Az.   This is one of my favorite places to eat, in the east valley. The picante hummus is better than Pita Jungles. The pricing is not terrible compared to the portions. The dishes are consistent. Definitely worth a stop in my opinion.

Good stuff! Seems to be relatively healthy. Great snack  before or after the gym. 4 stars because of inconsistency in the bowls. Ex. Sometimes you get honey, sometimes you don't.

One of my favorite locals spots on a Monday night for beer pong and wings. Patio bartender is one of my new favorite peeps.

There was nobody running the drive through of this location at 1130pm on a Monday night. I stopped in and waited for about 5 minutes at the drive through. I was never greeted or served. Needless to say I was very disappointed to have wasted my time and gas driving to this location for nothing.

Om nom nom... So good. If you're a fan of pho, these guys do it traditional style. No msg in the broth,  just a quality family recipe using good ingredients cooked for over 8 hours. Don't believe me,  try the broth BEFORE you put sriracha and hoisin in it. If that doesn't convince you,  just take note how you feel after drinking it.  Normally I get super dehydrated from the sodium and have to pound a bunch of water, not here.  Can't wait to sample the rest of their menu. I'll update my review when I get a chance to go back.  Oh btw, Alan who is father/chef wants to show us what GOOD Asian food is like... Not this panda crud (my words,  not his) or buffet slop.

I like this place! So glad to have something besides Starbucks. The cold brewed "Toddy" is a nice change, and not something that's easy to find on this side of town. Food wise, I've had the picante burrito. Really good, but has a little bit of heat behind it. Then again, jalape√±os make me cry, so I'm a bit of a wimp. The chocolate croissant was really good too. You could actually see and taste the chocolate, unlike the ones sold at those chain places. Beyond that, the place is smallish, so be prepared to take your stuff to go when they're busy. Also adding to the "cool" factor, they keep their coffee bean roaster right up front where you can see it. IMO, the place is worth trying if you like coffee or cafes.

So... They lost a star for a bad customer service experience. If your menu is wrong, either pull the menu or honor the price. Regardless don't just make excuses.

So good!  Digging the monthly specials. They now have their toddy coffee concentrated in jars,  to take home.

A little confusing for the first trip, but nice after you figure out the ordering system. Been here twice so far. Sandwiches are good.  Definitely try the brownie if you like sweets.

First visit, 4 stars. Keep in mind, I'm rating this based on the expectations of what it really is... Mexican FAST FOOD, not a true sit down restaurant.  That being said...  The place has decent decor, with a couple tv's playing what ever game is on. The place is clean.  The girls working the counter were nice, and actually SMILED! When taking a to go order, they still offer you chips and salsa. The salsa bar has the usual green, red, Pico, limes, etc.  The prices were right in line with Fili-B's.  First visit, I got their carne asada fries with errthang on them, and a couple shrimp tacos. ...and now the reason for the 4 stars. The meat on the fries actually tasted grilled, even a lil Smokey! Not oily and old like most of the fast food spots out there. The shrimp tacos were ok. Not good , not bad, but ok.   I will go back. Next time, I hope to try their red chili as well as their beans and rice. I'll update my review then.   So, if you're looking for a quick taco or burrito in the area, this place gets the thumbs up from me. ... You know, a total stranger who is recommending a place for you to eat. Take it for what it is, and happy Yelping!

A rare 5 star rating from me. Like my profile says good product will get you 4 great service will get you 5.  Isabel's Amor has become one of my favorite spots to grab lunch.   The food has come out fresh and well prepared every time, unlike some of the surrounding fast food Mexican joints in the area.   The decor is clean, with a slight vintage industrial vibe to it. When the weather is nice, they open up one of the walls to the patio (I'm sitting here enjoying the smell of rain right now).  The service is great. Seems that Anthony takes care of me every time.  He's friendly, fast, and my drink never reaches empty.  The staff also recognizes me when i walk in, a BIG customer service WIN in my book.  The lunch special is very reasonable, and the enchilada style chile rojo chicken burrito is def one of my favs. I get it with a side of sour cream and the borracho beans (pinto beans cooked with chorizo and chilies).  The enchilada sauce has just enough of a spicy and salty bite to make interesting when paired with the sour cream.  The beans have a taste that's very similar a traditional chili. It's definitely enough to fill me up...  If you're looking for spot for a casual or even business lunch while in this area, i would highly recommend stopping here.  It also wouldn't be a bad choice as a date night spot either.  Happy Yelping folks, and I hope you enjoy your meal!

Flavors are good here, almost authentic.  I do recommend trying it for yourself though. This is definitely not Panda, so if you're looking for huge portions on the cheap, try somewhere else... (and maybe reevaluate your diet choices...) I've tried the chicken lemongrass, and the butter chicken, and enjoyed them both.  The servings were more than filling.  The chicken lemongrass had just the right amount of spiciness for me.   I'll update if anything changes,  but so far this place is a win.

Can't redeem your own rewards program. No cold brew. No offer from the manager to make it right, except, "we will have at 4 pm." Sorry I'm not hanging out 2 hours to wait for a coffee. Thanks for making me stand in line in the 110 degree heat for nothing.  AND... It was very insulting that you comp'd drinks for the person in front of me that had a similar issue, and then asked me to come to come back later as your resolution.

Was going to give this place 3 stars for effort, and because I only made one visit, but they managed to lose one at the very end of my visit.   I was out searching for something new and different in the area, with out much luck. That's when I spotted Tokyo Joe's Healthy Asian Grill.  I decided to give it a shot. Should've known I wasn't in for the best Asian dining experience, when I walked in and the place looked like every other new fast food place that have been popping up in the area. Ex: Cafe Rio, Cafe Zupas, etc. Sadly there also wasn't a single Asian person in the place.   Ordering was fairly quick, with sushi, build your own bowl, and a couple pre -designed items. The place offers several different iced tea options, sadly, the first two selections I made were empty. I ordered the gyoza appetizer, ramen noodles, and the aforementioned iced tea.   I'm going to preface this by saying that I grew up in a primarily Asian family, so I hold my Asian foods to a higher standard. That being said, the food sucked. The gyoza's were of the pre packaged store bought variety (or at least the taste and texture suggested that) with a few dried out green onions sprinkled on top. The accompanying dipping sauce was good (ponzu I believe). Ramen was over cooked and bland. The broth had a decent flavor, but was not enough to save the meal. The egg was too over over cooked for my liking. Chicken also seemed pre packaged.   So here's where they lost a star. Managers take note. If a staff member makes eye contact with a customer, they should at least be acknowledged. ESPECIALLY if the customer says something to them. On my way out the door, one of the employees crossed paths with me. I said excuse me as I made my way by, then said have a nice night. They looked at me as if they were deaf... (If they were actually deaf, I'll retract this part of my review)   Either way, long story short, no I would not recommend this place and will not be back. If you're going out for Asian, there's many places I would recommend, over this one, that are in the area. Try Thai Chili or Simis Cafe instead.   Happy Yelping!

This shop is tucked away in the backside of San Tan Mall closer to the movie theater. I've been here a few times now, and the drinks have been consistently good. For those expecting "Half and Half Tea House" it's not quite there, but for SE Gilbert, it's pretty damn good. The ladies working the counter have always been nice.  I've listened to them explain the drinks to customers who didn't quite know what Boba was, even gave them a sample of Honey Boba to try before they ordered it. If you want to try something cold and that is not another Starbucks, I would say give them a shot. I'll for sure be back.
