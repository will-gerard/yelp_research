Great place to grab some slices for lunch or to get a whole pizza for whatever.  The toppings are great, perfect amount of sauce, and always extra cheesy.  They have great specials for slices and the rest of their menu.  Good choice for a casual pizza place in Tempe.

I've been here twice and I would have to say that the pizza is good but not great. After trying to go here a few times with no luck and there always being a three hour wait. We finally wised up and showed up at 3ish to be first in line. Yeah you still have to wait but only twohours since they open at 5 but you will always get sat in the first seating.  This place is really small and people seem to still like to come here in large groups and with small kids. The menu is limited to just a few items, I'm not complaining but it seems some folks think this place is something different. You can check out there menu online before you go if you don't like what they offer don't go. They serve a sorta traditional Italian variety of pizza either you like it or ya don't.  This past time I went a few weeks ago the owner is no longer making the pizzas, I am not sure why. They are not open that often so who knows.  Both times I've went I got the margarita and the wiseguy pizza. Both of them were quite good. If you dine in you can get some extra pizzas to take home but they don't have any regular take out. So I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in Phoenix but try to get there early so you don't have to wait so long.

Been here a few times. This time the service was really slow and they weren't that busy so not sure what their deal was.  When we got there it was not that long to be seated but once seated at our table we waited like ten minutes till someone came over to greet us. We had plenty of time to decide on our whole order while we were waiting to be greeted. So we order drinks, appetizer, main meal all at once.  The appetizer came out in just a few minutes but it took longer till we got our drinks. For the appetizer we had the potato cakes, quite yummy.  It took well over 40 minutes from when we first placed our order till we got our main meal. Quite a long time for what was ordered. I enjoyed the parmesan chicken it was different but still very good.  Because we were too full for dessert but still wanted the have the huge chocolate cake, had to get it to go.  Overall good food and drinks, but terribly slow service. Some of the prices here are a little ridiculous, too.

Best place for cheap greasy tasty Mexican food. Every thing on the menu looks great but I usually only have the carne asada fries or Guacamole supremea.  Oh carne asada fries! They start out with a huge plate of fries then pile carne asada meat on top. Then next add on the sourcream, cheese, and guacamole. Oh so good. A little on the greasy side but still quite tasty.  Now even better the quesadilla supremea, so delicious!! Large flour tortilla filled with all the good stuff. Carne asada meat and cheese layered with sour cream and guacamole.  Everything on the menu is reasonable priced and they even have some specialty Mexican foods. But all at semi-fast food style.  I can't wait to get back to Phoenix for some more.

It's been a while since I have been here but this place rocks. When i lived in Phoenix I took my dog Heidi here many times.  We took Heidi here for daycare and boarding. They have areas for the dogs to play outside and inside as well. Heidi really enjoyed the playtime in the pool. The dogs are constantly supervised and played with throughout the day. If you are boarding the dogs stay in there own private kennels overnight. At all times there is someone on premises even over night.  Unlike most places they don't nickle and dime you for each playtime, snacks, or trips to play in the outside area. The price for boarding is not much more than a full-day of daycare.  Heidi always seemed like she had a good time here and came home a tired happy dog. This would be my number one choice for doggie daycare or boarding in Phoenix.

For a long time I had thought about stopping by this place after working nearby and shopping in the area. But it was not until a customer gave me a coupon for them that i finally made the effort to drop in and check them out. Oh was I so happy when I finally did.  This place has wonderful cupcakes in quite a few different varieties. I am not sure what all these other people are complaining about for variety. Like how many different types of cupcakes do u need?  They sell regular size cakes and even mini-cupcakes as well. Through out the shop they have gifts of foodie items and other cutesy items for sale.  I really like this place and have been there many times and I really  LOVE the cupcakes. If you are in Ahwatukee be sure to stop by here for a delicious dessert.
