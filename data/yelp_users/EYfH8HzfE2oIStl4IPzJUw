OPA!  As if dining on the Mediterranean itself, more than just going out for dinner, Greekfest is an ethnic experience.  Marathon lengths have been overcome to solidify Greek authenticity.  The owner ensures a personal experience by often stepping from the kitchen to visit guest at their table; educating about the Greek experience or just making sure everyone is happy.  The saganaki is made with kefalograviera cheese which is what was originally intended; also offering an exclusive sausage saganaki.  Directly importing ouzo from Greece these labels will not be found at Total Wine or BevMo.  Avgolemono soup; if you can't pronounce it, just ask for "the lemon soup", they'll know what you mean.  More than once I've filled up on appetizers, soup and ouzo, keeping the tab less than a ticket to Athens.

Pushing the boundary of the Chinese buffet.  Generally I'll visit an establishment at least three times prior to writing a review.  A second or third visit to Mike Kwan's Gold Coin would be of surprise to me. CASH ONLY, with tax included $6.15 paid for my admission to this buffet-style meal.  Kid's under the age of four eat for $2.  It was surprisingly busy.  The "buffet", in its entirety: Won-Ton Crisps Fried Rice Chow Mein Mixed Vegetables French Fries Egg Roll Halves Fried Chicken Hot Wings Sweet & Sour Pork  Here in lay my greatest criticism; Yes, technically, there is more than one Chinese item among the food set out in large trays for an individual to return to as many times as they like.  In no other way does the Gold Coin overlap with common consumer expectation of a "Chinese Buffet."  So, why was it so busy?  Because, for a tick north of five bucks a person could gluttonously stuff themselves with the above items; it is better thought of as an economical "family-style" meal.  If it was advertised as such, I bet Mike's would get better reviews as people wouldn't feel mislead when they walked in, and the balance of Chinese, to American, to Italian, to Mexican to whatever cultural dishes would be freed up as well.  It has its redeeming qualities, which is why it didn't get the single start rating; it's clean, inexpensive, and seemed like a friendly casual atmosphere.

A Mexican restaurant & cantina that stands out in the southwest; unrivaled chips and salsa, quaint setting, striking and gracious staff.  Craving curbing classics like fajitas, enchiladas, tacos and tamales could easily have one overlook enchanting favorites such as shrimp stuffed pineapple or comforting chingalingas.  Inimitable ambiance has supported everything from weddings, charity events, and blow out Cinco de Mayo celebrations, to intimate date night getaways, happy hours, or Sunday brunches with visiting loved ones.  Monday night football, casual business gathering, or weekend day drinking; Aunt Chiladas is the neighborhood drop in for regulars and the stuff out of towners reminisce of once departed.

"...we aren't the cheapest place in town, we aren't the most expensive..." Trusting one's mechanic, priceless.  It is hard enough when something is going wrong with a vehicle.  Whatever the news is going to be, I want it to be coming from you.  Thank you Cathedral Automotive; for all you have done, and haven't, to my automobiles since I first had the pleasure of your service in 2001.

Laughter is brightest where food is best.      ~ Irish Proverb  Rosie's upholds all that we love about Irish Pubs.  Its loud demeanor and often live music are great for hanging out and knocking back a few pints; several Irish draughts available.  Dining alone, with friends, or looking to make new ones, you'll feel welcomed.  One could easily take visiting parents here for dinner, or find themselves making out in the parking lot with someone they just met; few places can boast this kind of versatility.  If looking to really get into the conversation, check the band schedule on their website before committing, otherwise you could find yourself trying to carve out space on the patio to hear one another.  Quality cuisine is not lost on this midtown Celtic roadhouse; boxty, corned beef & cabbage, and shepherd's pie culture the menu, while burgers, reubens, and a BLT remain as hearty staples.  The fish & chips are worthy of the drive you might make from whatever far reaches of the valley you come.  Casual dining, happy hour, or dancing a jig into the wee hours of the night, it's obvious why Rosie McCaffrey's is the epicenter of St. Patrick's Day celebration in Phoenix Metro.

"...the exception to the rule..."  As a regular of the "Los 24/7-bertos" style establishments, the chicken tacos, horchata, carne asade fries and breakfast burritos are usually synonymous valley wide as a safe bet for late night Mexican food.  This review is meant as a warning for those who inch through this location's drive-thru.  Here lay the exception.  Unfortunately, on more than one occasion, months, if not years apart, at different times of the day and night, THIS Filiberto's has screwed up  ...wait for it...  chicken tacos.   Such a cornerstone type order repeatedly subjected to blasphemy.   Perhaps there's a sign in the kitchen directing to leave off the pollo in the chicken tacos and replace with lettuce and cheese.  Like being woke from pleasant dreams with a bucket of water, the craving for chicken tacos becomes disillusioned with the first bite; replaced with images of Clara Peller asking "Where's the beef?"  The place is clean, in a convenient location, and always open, but a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix Metro screwing up tacos has numbered days.  The places within a mile of here where a customer can get gratifying tacos are boundless.  If you have a hankering for this dialect of Mexican food, drive down the street to the next Filiberto's, or Julioberto's, or Los Beto's...etc. where they're going to hook you up. Give this one some time to figure out their tacos.

Everyone has their favorite pizza place, this is my very close runner up.  Toppings so fresh some are grown on site; this beauty parlor turned pizza salon is the best "fancy pizza" encountered to date.  Distinctive delicious specialty pizzas such as the Puttanesca along with formidable performances on classics like "just pepperoni and sausage".  Their wine, beer and cocktail selection endorse the chic mood, then authenticate upon delivery to the palate; a mojito crisp enough for the aroma to reach us before it did our lips, an in-season draught, and a chardonnay buttery enough to slip past a rough day.  Classy casual ambiance with "still able to have conversation" audio level,  well worth 20% tip service make the Parlor good for a date with someone special, happy hour, and/or visiting with out-of-towners.  Venturing away from pizza will have auspicious results; so it's also promising for local regulars and high quality take-out.  The 8" or 12" pies will leave some wanting more, while allowing others to indulge and still watch their figure.  Parking can also get lean, so have some cash ready to take advantage of the valet that's available during busier times.  Very cosmopolitan, we can still see their pizza parlor roots offering the regular menu combination of a 12" pizza and pitcher of beer for $25.

* * * * * * * * Did Not Honor Yelp Check In Offer * * * * * * * *  I've walked into this store a total of three times.          First Time: 2/24/2015 A discussion regarding screen protectors for a new tablet.  They didn't have any.   So I inquired, if one was purchased on-line, could they put it on the tablet.  They could not guarantee that they would be able to do it without getting any air bubbles or dirt under the protector.  I appreciate them being upfront about this as the clerk behind the counter made it clear; no one working at the store at this time was very good about getting them on just right.  Unfortunately, I am capable of getting them on with air bubbles and dirt under it all on my own.          Second Time: 3/16/2015 Predictably so, it happens, the screen cracks on my smart phone.  This is why insurance is sold for just this sort of thing.  I thought of this store; maybe they could help me out for less than the insurance.  The cost to fix through my insurance is $100.00. Their estimate to fix the cracked screen: $259.00 The retail cost of the phone is 399.99. Same phone, with service contract, in this plaza, at the Verizon Store is FREE. The clerk and I agreed it would be better to go through the insurance.           Third Time: 3/16/2015, less than a moment later Amidst cracked smartphone glass; I yelped uBreakiFix.  It has a check-in offer 'a free iPhone screen guard' when you check in; walked right back in and spoke with the same guy.        After checking with the manager, he says "you have to show us your review."        Pointing out it is a "Check-In Offer" saying nothing about completing a review; he again goes to the back to check with the manager.        The manager comes back with him and exclaims the same, "...need to show a review.  Just write a quick short something, whatever..."        Once again, clarifying it is a "check-in offer" the manager began to talk about being confused with another offer for completing a review.  Changing gears, his focus went to the three types of finishes the iPhone guards had; clear, matte, and mirror.        I say, "OK," then the manager disappears to the back without another word.      Time passes and the original clerk assists another customer.  Once he finishes, and I am again the only individual in the store, I ask for clarification, "Is he grabbing that?"  This clerk, once more, goes to check with the manager.  The clerk returns exclaiming they don't have the screens, but if I want to purchase a different one they would take off $5.  A little too similar to bait and switch for my taste, given the investment I'd already made in clarifying a Check-In Offer, and having never been provided a service or product that I'd asked for when coming to them; I didn't even look to see what price was being discounted.

A Nutrition Playground  Quickly becoming my favorite grocery store; it's not for everyone.  Most mainstream grocers have an aisle, section, or variety of organic/health conscious food available, in Whole Foods Market it becomes the standard.  Filled with inspiring food, and people; Juice Bar, Sushi and Seafood counters, Deli Counter, Pizza Parlor, "Mini-Panda Express" Counter, Salad Bar, Soup Bar, Coffee Shop, Bakery, Butcher Shop, and Bar Bar are all just hanging out inside this concourse of nourishment.  With so many options for instant feasting it's no wonder they have so much seating available, inside and out.  The focus on quality definitely comes with its price tag inferring the typecast that it is expensive to eat healthy.  If on a tight budget, one will probably be shopping elsewhere which is why it's getting only four stars.

The best pizza in town!!!  "...so good you'll jump up and slap the person sitting next to you..." Yes, it is really that good.  So much flavor; with a secret ingredient in the sauce that is so secret most don't know there is a secret.  There are two signature pies that are vegetarian, that can hold there own against the classic pepperoni & sausage.  Their "regular crust" is a thin crust, and they do offer a thick.  Every pizza comes cut in squares.

Buried Treasure  Urban lore often directs one to look among the rubble of dubious boroughs for the finest of flavor.  People have likely driven by Restaurant Atoyac Estilo Oaxaca for years, without stopping, overlooking this diamond in the rough.  I had.  Having won the Phoenix New Times Best "Rising From the Ashes" Award; there is more than meets the eye to this otherwise humble establishment.  Just beyond the rush hour traffic lay explosions of flavor in fish, al pastor, chorizo, and mole tacos.  Heading back to the counter for seconds; the shrimp, carne asada, and chicken tacos reverberate the same savory blasts.  Excavate through the ice that once chilled some of the finest horchata in the valley and resurrect the remains of cantaloupe and pecan.  Regardless of opinions on the curb appeal, the inside is always clean, inviting, and pleasant; indoor and patio seating.  The striking young lady at the counter is friendly and accommodating; offering onions, peppers, and sauces.  Accept them, then find a place to sit with safety straps; it's about to get exciting.
