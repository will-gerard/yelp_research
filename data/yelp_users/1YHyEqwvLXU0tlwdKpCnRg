Great family restaurant for REAL authentic Mexican food on the South side of Phoenix. Busy on a Saturday but the wait was worth it. Again another good place to bring our baby.   The prices were cheap for quality. We got two entrees, an appetizer and two drinks for $20. I got a chicken taco and asada taco dinner combo. The asada taco was amazing! Beautifully seasoned and not over cooked. The refried beans were the second best thing I ate on my plate. OMG. Best beans ever! The chicken taco could have been a little more seasoned for my taste and the nachos we had for appetizer I will probably pass on next time. They reminded me of the nachos you can get at a baseball game.   Overall, I'll definitely be back! Yum!

My first issue is not getting acknowledged when I walk through the door which definitely happened at this place.   It was a Sunday afternoon so not busy at all. Actually just myself and a friend and the person working who was on the phone the entire time not once looking up to acknowledge us or welcome us to the store.   Besides that the actual store was very cute. It doubled as a retail shop and a place where you can throw events for the little princesses in your life. There was a tea party area and a little salon area. Very cute idea for a gathering.   The amount of product was more nicknacks and not a lot of apparel. A great trap for the impulsive buyer such as a child.   Although the store was a unique gem because of the service received I would not consider it for an event for my daughter.

The pizza was over prices and greasy and the staff was extremely rude. Placing the order on the phone, the guy talked down to me about how I made my original order (I said through yelp he corrected me on what the system is called like I know!) and when they came to deliver the lady called and was screaming at us like a manic like she had been there for hours. She called that one time. I would never recommend this place.

Stopped in for breakfast with the girls. I've been before for meals for happy hour and dinner but never breakfast. We had small children with us and the outdoor patio was a great option, no problem with including the kids in the fun!  The breakfast itself was amazing! I got an order of French toast with eggs. The eggs were fake eggs but did not need salt or pepper it was really delicious. The French toast on the other hand was EPIC. The "sauce" of the plate was the syrup and was garnished with blueberries. It was simple but so delicious and the presentation was beautiful.  The ladies said their mimosas were also great and a strongly suggested beverage for the drinking diners!   One thing, we had a group of about 6 and it was not offered to split the bill and the waiter definitely struggled with keeping separate multiple cash paying customers.

I found this company through a Yelp Deal and have used them to move twice! For the past few years I've switched from moving myself with Uhaul to using movers. This was the second company I've used and I will never use another company again!   Each time (2011 and 2013) I used the company they were simply AMAZING! They arrived early to start the move at the requested time. They did a throughout run through and asked me lots of questions about how I wanted the move to go. The first time I was a bit unorganized and they even helped me pack things neatly and carefully. Once things were packed they moved everything so quickly, each time they were done with my entire 1 bedroom apartment in a hour or less.   The second time I moved with them the apartment management made us wait cause the move in process was horrible!! (check out my review for Presidio at South Mountain in a few months) But the staff at Just In Time remained friendly, patient and professional.   I would and do recommend them anytime needs someone is looking for movers! I can't wait to use them again!!!

Another jury duty lunch escapade! There was about 10 of us and it took about 20 min for that big of a group to be seated which was great for the busy downtown Phoenix rush.   I believe everyone got lunch this time around and some highlights include great black tea, huge wraps (highly recommended ) and super quick service!   We were able to spilt the check as well which was another plus.   Great environment. Usually would recommend the outside seating but it was extremely windy so it was closed during lunch.

Another Sunday Funday activity for the girls that I have mixed reviews on. When first arriving an hour before closing time for a walk in mani/pedi what appeared to be the manager struggled to want to agree to take me as a client. When my friend suggested a particular technician he promptly said he had somewhere to be and couldn't see me.   Eventually I was seen and received great service from another woman. She was super sweet, helpful and patient as I explored outside of my normal color palette. The only strange aspect was that she removed my original gel by scrapping it off with her own nails. A bit weird but not painful, kind of like nails on a chalkboard chill. I was nervous they may give me an issue about doing my pedicure since they didn't not do it all together and once it was time it was almost closing time but she helped me and it was a great ending.   There was also a Keurig for the customer! Lovely touch!!! I would recommend this salon but maybe making an appointment would make you feel a little more welcome.

I've been to another location of Fast Med before but I really enjoy my experience with this location. The staff is really friendly and professional. The doctor was very easy to talk to as well.   One tip is it is definitely recommended you have your actual insurance card if that is the first time you have been there.   I have been here both for employment testing and when I had a really bad cold. I would highly recommend this for both needs!

This dining experience was average at best. Our order took forever because the party before had such a large order. So it appears as they had just one chef for the lunch hour.   The sushi itself was great. There were a lot of original rolls on the menu. The one thing we noticed about the drinks were that you could get the same size beer at the restaurant next door for $4 cheaper.   I would recommend trying another option for sushi downtown if you want more ambience but if it's just good sushi to go you're looking for, not a bad option.
