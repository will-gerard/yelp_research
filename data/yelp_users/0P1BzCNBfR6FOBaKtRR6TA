I needed a new bra. I went to this store and they had salespeople who helped measure and fit me all the while being modest and professional. I left with a great fitting bra and ordered a second one that they shipped to me at no extra charge.  It was one of the most pleasant shopping experiences I have ever had. I left feeling happy.  Very pleased and enjoying a nice supportive bra. I am 47 yrs old.

We contracted with American Vision Windows to install a custom Titan Security Door for the front of our home.  The salesperson Elias was knowledgable and gave us many options and colors to choose from.  The door was installed without any problems and the new door looks great!! We have had several comments from the neighbors saying that the door looks great!! When we are ready to do our windows we will certainly call Elias and have American Vision do our windows because we know it will be done the right way at a fair price.

My husband and I tried it out. The wait was extremely long. When we got seated our waitress did not even explain how the menu worked or how the steaks are cooked. She was rather rough and said crude jokes. My meal came out fine after another very long wait. My husbands came out wrong. It was tough and way overdone. He pointed it out and they did take it back and redo it after some more time. Our waitress was never around and we ran out of drinks. The manager was nice and came out and refilled our drinks a couple of times. I also felt the price was very inflated for the quality of the food we received. I was Not impressed.
