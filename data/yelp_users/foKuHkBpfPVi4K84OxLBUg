New Thai favorite in Phoenix. Every dish I've tried is vibrant, fresh and delicious. I have not yet had any sort of unpleasant experience at Wild Thaiger. Stop by for lunch for a cheaper version of their entrees! It will become your newest restaurant addiction..

Loved my first, quick experience here. Baristas were super sweet, espresso tastes wonderful and all flavoring options higher quality. Lovely local coffee shop

I rented a pickup truck and a large moving truck recently for my move from central Phoenix to north Phoenix. I had an awesome experience with the extremely efficient employees here. They provided fast-paced customer service with knowledgable and honest practices. We'll definitely use this location for future moving/storage needs

Regularly go here for basic sushi fare. Not the best, but it's not a Scottsdale sushi chain owned by Caucasian douchebags so I'd rather give Hiro my business :) Gave 4 stars because the sushi is above average taste-wise and they do NOT have any type of happy hour specials

Ate late afternoon lunch on a weekend at Lon's. The appetizer and burger I shared with my partner were amazing.. the drinks were also delicious, but the prices were pretty freakin high (completely expected for the area.)

Coffee and food is just okay. Service was lackluster.. Customer service soft skills training and basic manners missing.. usually smaller coffee chains have friendlier and more attentive service than places like Starbucks or Coffee Bean, but not in this case. They treated my sweet mother like crap  Next time we'll wait to eat at Butterfield's!

Christina's is so delicioso it makes me want to cry! Seriously. I have brought almost all my immediate family members and friends here to enjoy their authentic, fresh dishes. If I lived in the area (and didn't just work nearby) I would go much more often.

Love love this place. 5 star rating is for the delicious, fresh pupusas! Service is usually just fine (we've never had a bad experience being served promptly).

Our favorite location and always satisfied here  Great happy hour food and beverage specials. Not sure what others are complaining about! More than 10 years coming to this location and they are always consistent, delicious and accommodating.

Delicious! Waiting too long to try this place. I could've been spending my money on tortas here ALL THIS TIME!! I ordered a chicken torta and requested the tinga-style chicken. Freakin amazing, fresh and light choice for this hotter-than-hell Phoenix summer. I'll be returning soon to try other great priced, creative dishes here.

Love the brand, dislike this location. The employees act like they work at Saks Fifth Ave with their uppity attitudes. Hey guys, you're all making minimum wage and selling clothing so let's get some customer service training! I suppose I didn't have enough Louis Vuitton on that day. No matter, I'll use my loaded gift card on several items on the website. The store associates referred me there when I asked about different size availability and didn't offer to call other locations or order what I wanted from the store. Lazy bratty kids

Love the jewelry at the Phoenix location and every piercing I've had from HTC Tempe location has healed beautifully. I haven't had the greatest luck with piercings healing until I started getting them at HTC. Service at both locations has always been great. Yes, sometimes there is a wait- go there earlier and not on weekends!

Just had an awful experience with coworkers at this Pita Jungle location. Got here at 11:15 to beat the lunch rush, ordered within 10 minutes and didn't see our food until after 12pm. When we inquired about the status, our server said "we're busy right now" and left us to wait another 10-15 minutes while other customer that arrived later than our trio were paying their bills! Then we receive the food and everyone's dish was significantly subpar compared to other recent experiences eating at this location. There was one time we were asked if everything was ok- before we'd even had a chance to eat (why do they do that?) There went $17 on a crap salad with over-cooked, skin-filled salmon and an iced tea that wasn't refilled once. Thanks, guys. I'll stay up in central Phoenix for future work lunches.

Had another awesome experience here at La Santisma last night. Although they were super busy, they managed to serve us promptly and the street tacos were great. I couldn't believe their house margarita was so tasty (and just $6.) Only bad part was I found out which salsa is the hottest for me (the peanut lit my mouth on fire) but all were delicious.

Love love this pet store. This is where I buy all of my little monster schnauzer's pup food, bones, toys and baths. For years they've consistently provided great quality product at great, affordable prices. In addition to that, the staff are knowledgable, personable and professional.  LOVE. IT. I'd like to try the anesthesia free teeth cleaning here soon (don't tell the little monster schnauzer haha)

Rude and discourteous employees. No horchata latte. Bummer waste of time. Phoenix and Tempe Cartels are completely different.

Love this place. I have a great experience with service and food almost every time we visit. Such a good location as I can walk here from home (woop, no DD needed). I dream about the gnocchi with short ribs..

Love this little taqueria. The prices are so cheap that it doesn't really matter that the meat quality is a bit on the low end. I've never waited more than 45 minutes even on the busiest nights.. I do wish they made their own horchata, though, instead of using what I believe to be a powder mix..

I am definitely a fan of this nail spot. I have become a bit of a regular customer and have a few favorite nail designers that I specifically request. The time taken to complete their services and the finished product are impressive.  I don't agree with some other reviews that mentioned problems with professional conduct. At almost EVERY other nail place (unless you're at the PHOENECIAN) people are screaming in Vietnamese (unless you know what they are saying I believe THAT is more unprofessional and quite rude). This is a NAIL BAR! Women can let loose here and chat about whatever they please. I do agree that foul language is not acceptable for employees, but I'd like to come here feeling comfortable enough to talk about anything I want. Frankly, its nice to actually SPEAK to someone while getting my nails done and not feel like I'm not being understood (i.e. English language barriers at other salons).   I've had several good experiences and I ALWAYS get compliments on my nails. I think I have referred at least 5-6 other clients to Teres so far! I DO agree that the selection of nail polish could be increased and the quality of maintenance done to trim cuticles, clean under nails, etc could be stepped up a notch (especially during pedicures).  All in all, they are still a new business and I think its amazzinnggg that they are conveniently located in Old Town Scottsdale. I have never been to a nail salon quite like this one. I will continue to patronize and refer new clients to Teres.

Great concept and colorful menu. I have no complaints about the delicious Johnny Cakes I had here, but the Mexican Benedict lacked flavor/spices. We ordered a latte and a cappuccino, and we found that we probably should have stuck with drip coffee here as the espresso was meh. Location is great, but the restaurant is almost completely hidden from the road (somehow?!) Deserves a "4"! Will give it a second try soon

I am really a big fan of Caf√© Rio, but NOT this location. I have visited this location 6-10 times since living in the neighborhood, and I've noticed a serious decline in service and food quality (especially when compared to other locations in the valley). The employees don't wear nametags most likely because of their poor customer service skills and lack of interest in their jobs (including the manager, a dark haired guy, about 6'2.) The food quality today totally grossed me out-- the lettuce was wilted, guac was brown and other ingredients just seemed old. Definitely NOT worth the nearly $10 price tag for (1) salad... Unfortunately, I'll be adding this restaurant to my "places not to go" list.

What a snake-like way to use regular customers and Yelp reviewers to come into your restaurant- don't change the menu or photos on Yelp to reflect the change in management and complete menu makeover!  We had never been here, but I remembered everything I'd heard and didn't think to check Yelp before coming tonight. Got here and the waiter informed us that the owners are new, menu totally changed and previous specials nonexistent... Shady business practice

Consistently tasty, in & out-inspired burgers and service. Tacos are tasty, also, but I tend to visit here just for burgers/fries as I prefer to get street tacos elsewhere where they taste similar but cheaper! Horchata is also very good. It's a pretty higher priced drive-thru.

Visited this restaurant while moving last weekend and we all enjoyed our food and beers. My favorite part was their ability to "nitro-style" any of their beers. Yum! We'll be back to try more..

Sad, sad experience and now my least favorite Fox restaurant. Visited the Henry for the first time this past Friday for happy hour and dinner. Happy hour here is only for draft and well drinks, so we didn't benefit from it food-wise. We were greeted by a timid, shaky waiter on the patio and ordered the truffle fries (Applebee's-quality) short rib/s and pork chop. The short rib/s were quite small and lack-luster for the price (the similar dishes at North and Chelsea's just down the street could knock this tiny nightmare entree out). Pork chop was gigantic, but let's be honest- my mom makes better and it doesn't cost me $20+.   At the end of the meal, I felt horrible paying $92 for 3 "happy hour" priced drinks, a fry appetizer and 2 entrees. HUH?!

Unfortunately I can only comment on the poor service as I waited 20 minutes just for a waiter to come greet me to take my drink order.. No server ever arrived, and I had to leave and grab food elsewhere to go. I really wanted to try these tacos and experience this restaurant as a first time visitor. Bummer, but I had to get back to work in an hour, and this place didn't seem too worried about prompt service!

Alright.. I've officially become a bit of a regular here, dining here for Sunday lunch and during the work week. Consistent food quality and friendly, attentive service inside  I stand corrected on my first impression!

Unfortunately, this first-time in Phoenix version of St Louis Bread/Panera Bread Co does not live up to the company's solid reputation of providing high quality dishes and items to consumers. Their menu items are prepared sloppily and ingredients seemed old, tasteless. I grew up eating at St Louis Bread Co (aka Panera), so yes I'm a harsh critic. This location just cannot yet compare to what the majority of other Panera locations elsewhere in the US produce.

First time here and I ordered a carne asada torta from the lunch menu.. The service here was so great, but the carne asada was just a sad mess. I spit out the majority as it was full of fat and rough parts. I ended up eating the bolillo, avocado and papas for $10  Carne asada should be delicious if it's a headliner on the menu!

Should have driven to central Phoenix and gone to Joyride as the drive would have actually been worth it. Ordered plainly dressed "happy hour" priced "street tacos" for $12.75, changed my tequila from disgusting SAUZA to a higher quality tequila and the piece of crap ended costing $14.50! On happy hour! Our waitress informed us that she talked to her manager and the manager stated that was just the price it was going to cost. Thanks guys haha Most restaurants already use better tequila and don't charge that amount simply to upgrade to a better liquor.   In addition to that, service was subpar and that is always an aspect of a restaurant I place a very high expectation on. After all, there is WAY too much competition in Phoenix/Scottsdale to settle for any less. Needless to say, the $80 we spent will be much better served elsewhere next time we want tacos and margaritas.

If you go in for service, you've gotta ask for KYLE. He is amazing, honest and not a sales sleaze. I can't guarantee a good experience if you don't have Kyle helping you. My rating is for Kyle! I'm not a fan of the newer management group..

As described before the opening, this is a more casual version of Frasher's Steakhouse (complete with plastic utensils and a "place your order at the counter" routine), but with the same steakhouse-like higher prices.. The menu is also lacking most of the favorite Midwest food items the former restaurant had (now I have nowhere but St Louis to go to eat Imo's or toasted ravs!) I ordered a small portion of average brisket and a side for around $20  I don't think I'll be returning.. Too much competition in this neighborhood to deal with minimal options, a pricey menu married with a super casual, dark environment. Giving two stars for the attentive customer service, but I can't say I prefer the food, menu or restaurant atmosphere.
