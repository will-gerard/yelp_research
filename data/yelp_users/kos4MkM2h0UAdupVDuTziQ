This was one of the first Mexican food places I tried when I first moved to AZ ten years ago.  Back then I knew nothing, now I see that I was lucky to have been taken somewhere that would really get me interested in trying more Mexican restaurants.  Well after about 8 years I went back last night and had it again and I was impressed.  The beans were a little bland but that is about the only complaint I have.  The salsas were fresh and delicious as was the tortilla on my fish burrito. I could have just eaten a couple of the tortillas with the salsa.   My boyfriend got three hard shell beef tacos and it was only $3.49 and it came with chips. So not only was it tasty, it was cheap.  It is close to the freeway so even though I don't live very close I will be going back soon.

I went to the Rhythm Room this past week to see a band that I have been waiting 14 years to see.  I was so relieved and impressed when I saw the sound guy taking his time to get the levels just right and listening from every corner of the room to be sure everyone was hearing the band at its best.  The servers and bartenders were nice and attentive even though there was a pretty large crowd.  The only thing that bugged me was the totally drunk guy wandering around yelling complete nonsense while the band played.  The bartenders clearly serve until you are a blubbering idiot.  I guess to some people this would get them another star, not take one away.

I have always been a fan of Chipotle's food but haven't really been motivated to sit my ample butt down and give them a review.  Sure the tasty burritos the size of Mom's meatloaf should be worth a few kind words and their delicious guacamole is some of the best at a fast food style Mexican place that I have had.  What changed my mind and inspired me to write this was a recent article I read in Newsweek about the effort they are making to use humanely raised meat and rbgh free dairy.  I am not nearly as conscious as I should be about what I eat.   Knowing there is an option to support a business that is helping even in the smallest way would definitely change my mind about where I might fulfill my fast food urges.  They are not using 100% organic and cruelty free but they are doing a whole lot more than most fast food places.  (the pork is 100% humanely raised and they contracted with Tyson to get chickens raised specifically for them with a better diet and more room to move around.)  Good job Chipotle, while you may not be perfect at least you are making an effort.  If you'd like to learn more here is the Newsweek article:    http://www.newsweek.com/id/135376

I finally got over to this place and I am so glad that I did.  I took the advice of reviewers and went at an odd hour and we had no problem with parking or with getting a table.  I can't really say anything new about this place except that they sell Orbee dog toys, which I have not been able to find anywhere else in the Valley.  What dog doesn't need a chew toy shaped like an eggplant?  I suppose more people care about food than dog toys, so lets get back to that.  I got some sushi from the refrigerator case and my boyfriend ordered the BLT which was dressed with guacamole instead of the usual mayo.  He loved it.  I will definitely be going back here, even just to get a glass of the iced green tea.

This place has such a nice selection of salami that I would go back just for that!  My husband enjoys the great prices on the variety of Eastern European beers they have.   Be sure to check out the various dumplings they have in the frozen section, we really enjoy these and they taste very fresh.

This is one of my favorite places to shop.  You can always find great book bargains, and the clearance section always promises a good mystery or horror novel for $1.

I will agree with everything Calamari F. has to say and also throw in the fact that OMG the kids on LAGUNA BEACH eat at Pasta Pomodoro!!  ;)  But to reiterate, its safe, its predictable, its not that expensive and if you are near PV mall and can't venture too far it is pretty good considering the other choices within the area.    They get another star from me because the service was excellent  when I have gone there and that makes a big difference to me.  Calamari F. did point out that service has been hit or miss, but they were great the few time I have been there.  I wish I could give 3.5 stars.

I have gone here several times and have tried the pizza, subs and the calzones.  I have not had anything there that I did not like and the only reason I don't give this five stars is because everytime I am in there it seems a large group with lots of young kids has just sat down (or come to run around me while I try to eat) at the same time as my date and I.  I admit, I wish restaurants had sections for families so that those who do not like watching kids run around or spitting food out of their mouths on to the table could eat in peace, but that is just me and that is why I have dogs and not children.  Anyway, this place has awesome food, good service and if you can handle large groups of families then I highly recommend you take the drive out here to give it a try.

I have to say that I am going to sound very redundant here, but I love Lee Lees.  In the last few years I have become a lot more interested in food and especially international food, so Lee Lees is a dream come true.  It is mostly Asian, but they also have dutch, english and many other international foods and it is all organized by region.    They have a lot of Asian teas, spices, oils, sauces, and other staple ingredients you could find one of at your supermarket, but at Lee Lees they have a huge variety.  I won't repeat what other reviewers have said, but will touch on the fact that I could spend an entire day in there reading the translations into english on the back of the packaging on certain products.  I have had serious laughing fits in the aisles of Lee Lees.  Another thing you cannot fail to mention about Lee Lees is CHEAP IMPORT BEER.  We stocked up here for the Super Bowl and saved so much money and came out with a huge variety.

This store is on a short list of places my fiance refuses to go into.  The list consists of Guitar Center and Ikea.   While I am a fan of the latter I have to agree that going into Guitar Center has become like nails on a chalkboard to me.  First of all, it is loud as to be expected with a store that sells musical instruments. But this store is loud in a chaotic, disarming, and jarring way.  As Jake C. pointed out there will always be someone shredding on a guitar with the volume on 11.  There will always be some guy in the drum room showing off his double bass skills.  In addition to the folks that use this store as their own musician's showcase you have the staff who really ruin any chance this store has of keeping me as a customer.  It is inevitable that when I go in here the employee behind the counter is going to be so caught up in some conversation with Pimply Tommy about his punk band he is starting that I wait for at least 15 minutes to be helped. OR I am immediately approached and the employee tries to talk to me using all kinds of lingo to see just how much I know about drums.  Look 'Sticks' or whatever fun nickname you have put on your name tag, I don't play drums, I am just trying to save you from having my fiance come in here and start a riot because it takes 20 minutes to get some  $%^# drum sticks!!  My fiance ordered stand parts from here once and I had to wait for 10 minutes before someone helped me and then another 20 minutes while they searched for the parts that they had just called and told us arrived an hour before.  I have to give them 2 stars just because they do stock a huge variety of musical instruments and accessories.  But this store is one of the main reasons I am so glad we can shop on the internet.

I work in the office building next to the mall and hit the food court about once a week, and this place gets my money almost every time. (unless I can't pull myself away from the wafting scent of Panda Express Orange Chicken, but that is another review)  Their chicken walnut salad sandwich is my favorite, served on a delicious honey wheat bread.  Their soups and salads are fresh and they have different options daily.  But do not leave without a couple of their chocolate chip and snickerdoodle cookies.     Also, check out the cookie samples on the corner of the counter.

Sure the place is a giant gimmick, but its a fun gimmick and for what it is they do it well enough.  The food is what you would expect from a diner and it really isn't bad at all.  My boyfriend loves the shakes, I can't do much ice cream so I haven't had one.  On certain days of the week they have awesome deals for kid's meals.  One other thing that impressed me about 5 & Diner was found on their website.  First they have all of their nutritional information available, but even more impressive is they have a menu for Gluten free choices as well as Lactose free choices.  Very cool in my opinion.

This is a great sports bar in north scottsdale.  No 'snottsdale' folks here. Saturdays they have specials on their burgers, which are delicious.  They also have Taco Tuesdays, with discounted tacos.  Their menu has the usual mexican favorites and some good appetizers.  A good sports bar for the whole family to enjoy.

I have gone here a couple of times and was impressed with the food enough to go back.  This place serves your usual Mexican-American style food but does not go over the top on portions like some other  restaurants of the same genre.  The chicken I had was moist and well seasoned white meat.  I also tasted some of the steak from my boyfriend's burrito and it also had a good flavor.  The house margaritas are good, the salsa is tasty and the service was pleasant and our waitress apologized for neglecting us a bit because she had a 12 top in her section.  I would definitely go back here to try the Pollo Con Queso as my boyfriend's Mom said it was delicious.

I have two dogs.  One dog is 9 years old and has been to the vet for his usual shots and a couple of minor things over the last 9 years.  My other  dog is 3 years old and since we got him from the pound 2 years ago he has been to the vet on average once every 4 months.  You can liken my dogs to a Toyota that only needs the oil changed and a Ford that breaks down constantly.  Del Lago has been there for all of my routine vet needs and the various other minor emergencies my youngest dog has endured.  The problem child had to have surgery to remove a lump and the doctors at Del Lago let us bring him in as often as we wanted to have the wound cleaned and wrapped, with no charge.  It is those little things that make it obvious they really care about our pets.  They can handle all of your regular vet needs with care and compassion.  They also understand if you bring in your dog and say, well, he may just have a stomach ache or he may have swallowed my flash drive.  They treat each case with seriousness and give our dogs the best care we have found.

I like Mr Goodcents and have taken several friends there to introduce them to an alternative to Subway.  The subs are made fresh, the bread is soft and delicious and there is never a long wait.   You can get a pretty decent size meal for a great value, just as Kristin C. explained in her review.    I have not personally tried the pastas but friends have and they agree that they are pretty good for the price you are paying for them.

This place and its patrons give me a rash.  2 stars for the fact that it is cheap and the music is good.  If I had a dollar for every girl wearing red patent leather shoes I could have drank for days.  But make sure that dollar is cash so I can pay for my drink.  I think I am officially too old and this place confirmed it like a slap in the face.

I am not sure if this is the actual grocery or what, but I will review it as such.  This is a small bakery that has great breads and pastries.  They also have a small grocery with specialty items and some of their own sauces, spreads and oils.  Their produce is always fresh and fairly priced.  They even make their own large dog biscuits which sell for only $1.50 each.  My dogs definitely approve.  One Saturday afternoon I went in around 3pm and they had the loaves of bread buy one get one free.  I don't know if this happens in the late afternoon every weekend or if I just got lucky.

I work in the office building next to this mall so I have had a lot of experience with the food court.  Johnny Rockets is a great option if I get sick of Paradise Bakery or can withstand the lure of Panda's Orange Chicken.  I give this four stars based on the other selections in the food court.  You can get a nice sized burger, a BLT, even an egg salad sandwich if you are so inclined.  But what I really like is the grilled cheese.  Talk about a comforting lunch if you are having a bad day at work.  They use decent cheese and its not too greasy.  If only they served tomato soup...

This is reliable Mexican/American style food that is always tasty and has yet to disappoint.  The salsa is good, the chips are hot and the margaritas are always great.  I have never had anything less than great service here also.  They were even very patient and helpful when I went there with my nephews and niece who had never tried Mexican food before.  This is a safe place to take visitors from out of town who want to try Mexican.

If you have ever been around infants you know that if you place a shiny object in front of them they become instantly enamored.  I believe that the true fans of this publication have been studied and found to have a similar reaction. Dave B noted the lovely shine this magazine has and I do not believe this to be a coincidence.  944 has clearly done their research and for that I award them one star.

I really enjoyed the lunch I had at The Orange Table, and the service was actually quite attentive.  The menu has a large variety of sandwiches, burgers and salads. There are additional items available for dinner but I can imagine it is tough to get a table.  We went late in the noon lunch hour and did not have to wait long.  We were assured a couple of times that we would be seated soon but I wasn't too worried as we used the time to read over the very descriptive menu.  I would give it four stars for the great food and friendly service.  The fifth star comes from their great selection of beers.  Beer is just as good to pair with a meal as  wine and The Orange Table obviously recognizes that.  I will definitely be going back.

yes this is in a mall, but it is by no means food court fare.  Kona has great sushi, salads, and entrees.  They have a hoppin happy hour as well.  I would recommend the teriyaki salmon salad and the Las Vegas Roll.

I rented a U-Haul from here to move last summer.  It took me 2 days to even get someone to answer the phone to take my reservation and they ended up not having the truck size that I needed.  I made the reservation for a Friday and a Saturday so I would have enough time to move without being rushed.  When I went to pick up the truck the Manager rudely asked me if I really needed 2 days to move?  I said, I did, which is why I made the reservation for 2 days.  He then said, 'you seriously need to have the truck for 2 days while shaking his head'.  The manager also walked into the waiting room smoking a cigarette and when he saw me looked ticked off that I was there and put the cigarette out.  He also gave me a hard time about purchasing the insurance and was just overall surly and rude.    I give it one more star because the guys who worked in the garage area where we actually picked up and dropped off the truck were very nice and helpful.

Like the other reviewers said, the produce is very cheap and of good quality.  They offer a growing selection of organic produce also, as well as other organic offerings.  They have a self serve spice area where you can buy as much or as little as you want, so it is great if a recipe calls for something  you don't normally use so you won't buy a lot and waste it.  The trail mixes in the bulk food area are tasty and the beer and wine is reasonably priced.    The best thing is if you shop on Wednesdays, it is double ad day so you get the sales for the current week and the previous week.

The food is really good.  The only reason I did not give this five stars is because I was in there getting take out one day and saw a cockroach cruising through the dining area.  Not exactly what you want to see as you are waiting for your dinner.  That would be my only complaint, but you know what they say about cockroaches, where you see one....

This fine breakfast establishment is right next to my work and I am lucky enough to get to go there often.  Even if I go for work with a large group the service is good, the food is great, and the prices are very fair.  Most times when we go with a large group they give us one of their famous Apple Pancakes for free!  The Pancake house does not accept credit or debit cards,  it is cash or check only.  They also STRONGLY suggest you do not use  your cell phone while you are in the restaurant.  This policy alone warrants 5 stars.  They have signs all over the place advising of their request for this courtesy, which should be common, but some people are VERY important in case you did not know.  I have never had anything here that did not impress me.

This place is the best.  It is situated in the bottom floor of  the office tower on the corner of Goldwater and Camelback where I work. The owner is named George and he and  his family take great care of all of us employees in the office tower and the attached mall (fashion square).  George and his kids make sure to know everybody's name and greet you with a smile every time you come through the door.  They serve breakfast food including burritos, bagels, and french toast.  For lunch they have a full menu of sandwiches, a couple of soups a day and some salads.  They also have prepackaged snacks, gum and drinks to keep us workers going throughout the day.  Of course, as the name would suggest they also serve coffee, teas, and your usual fancy coffee drinks.  They seem to make a point to try to remember what your usual order is as well.    My company gets breakfasts and lunches catered from here and even if we end up with a last minute order for bagels for 10 people, they always try to accommodate us.  The food is good, filling and served from people who really care about making their customers happy.

This is a chain burger place, but they do make the burgers fresh and let you dress them yourself.  Granted, this same scenario plays out a thousand times better at The Chuck Box in Tempe, however,  The Chuck Box lacks one thing...a nacho cheese pump!  Oh, glorious plastic cheese that you can pump on your fries to your heart's desire.  Heck, pump it on to your burger if you want!      Three stars for the burgers and one star for the vat of cheese.

This place is great in so many ways.  First of all, for purely selfish reasons I love The House of Rice because it is really close to my house.  Second, I can get stroopwafels here, which are delicious Dutch cookies.  Yes, it is a predominately Asian grocery and supply store, but it also carries other international food stuffs.  It is small but jam packed full of goodies.  This is a great place to go for me when I don't have an hour to spend wandering the aisles of Lee Lees or the 99 Ranch market.

I work in the office building attached to Fashion Square Mall.  Around 3:00pm everyday I hear a faint whisper above the hum of the AC and the tap tapping on the keyboards of surrounding coworkers.  Do you hear it too...it is the Wetzel's Pretzels Pretzel bites calling my name.  I put on my headphones and then I swear I catch a whiff of their buttery salty goodness. It is so hard to not race into the mall and grab a bag and completely ruin my dinner.  This place cranks out delicious and fresh pretzels in a variety of flavors and sizes.  They even have a hot dog wrapped in a pretzel, be still my heart.    They are not quite as good as my home state's Auntie Anne's but they are really great when you have a snack attack.

I really like Dillard's and I am not just saying that because my future mother in law works there.  My office is attached to fashion square mall so I am able to peruse Dillard's on breaks and keep an eye on when things go on sale.  The sales are the key at Dillard's.  Once every few months they mark everything that is on clearance an additional 30% off.  I score tons of clothes for my nieces and nephews for next to nothing. I have also got some nice jewelry and shoes during this sale.  Dillard's probably doesn't do it for all the Scottsdale folks who define themselves by the label on their jeans, but it works for me and my family.

The atmosphere is great, the service is fast and friendly and the food is very good.  I got a chicken entree which came with garlic bread, a salad, a side of pasta with marinara and a vegetable.  They have a large selection on the menu for dinner and a bar/lunch menu featuring cold and hot sandwiches, calzones, and pizza.  I went on a Saturday at 6pm and there was no wait.

I really like AJ's.  From the beautiful produce, to the sushi guy making fresh sushi surrounded by import beers and stinky cheese this is what grocery shopping for the lazy foodie is all about. Sure, you could find all of these items by visiting several specialty stores, but AJ's makes it too easy to find all of the things you need to spoil yourself under one roof.  If you go around dinner time hoping to get some of their great prepared foods, you will have to be patient as the line is usually 10-15 people deep, but does move pretty quickly with the 'take-a-number' system.  They also have a salad and soup bar but that can also become pretty picked over during the dinner rush.  They have a large wine and beer selection, but it is more expensive than what you could get elsewhere.   Again, it is convenient if you are putting together a meal and don't want to be running all over the place.  They have helpful folks in the wine department as well.  This place ranks a star just for the fact that it has covered parking, which in AZ in the summer is truly something to covet.

I thought El Torito would be too fancy for me, seeing as how it is on Scottsdale road amidst all of the resorts, but it was surprisingly good and inexpensive.  If you order guacamole they make it fresh at your table and it is delicious.  They have a wide variety of food and great house margaritas.

Trader Joe's is just wonderful.  I have been shopping here since shortly after I moved to AZ ten years ago and the only complaint I have is that I get hooked on something and then it just goes away!  I don't know if it is supply problems or if this Joe guy is just cruel, but bring back the TVP taco and sloppy joe mix!!    Other than the evolving product line, there is nothing I don't like about TJ's.  You don't have to worry about sales, because they don't have them.  You don't have to worry about seeing Rachael Ray's maniacal face grinning at you from a box of Triscuits, because they don't sell them.  Most of what they sell is their own brand which means there is quality assurance because they are putting their name on everything they sell.    They get one star simply for the free food samples that are usually available and the free coffee that is always available.  As another reviewer mentioned, the prices are actually very reasonable.  The prices on their cheese alone is worth going in for.  If you want to pair the cheese with wine, they have a lof of choices and a lot of bargains.  Check out their pre-made food also, I have not been disappointed!

This is a great place if you love good beer.  And life is too short to drink bad beer!  They have a great selection of bottles that you can purchase and drink in the bar, or take out in a mixed 6 pack.  They also have a rotating menu of beer on draft.   This is not a bud light drinker's bar. They have great pizzas also.

This is where I take my truck for all of its oil change and truck happiness needs.  They are family owned and operated and I never feel like I am going to get ripped off or mislead.  They have a welcome board where they put your name if they know you are coming in and even offer you a ride wherever you need to be if you have to leave your vehicle behind.  I don't know anything about cars but I have never felt like I was being taken advantage of at Smart.

The food is what you would expect from a little burrito shop with a drive through.  Filling, somewhat greasy and cheap!  One warning and what made me stop going here was when my boyfriend handed them his debit card to pay and they handed him a slip of paper and said, write your pin number down please.  no thanks, I took my business to Fiesta Burrito.

I have to admit I made fun of my boyfriend's addiction to this place for a long time, but I now understand it.  I have a rather sensitive stomach and a lot the other _____berto's style restaurants have an adverse effect on my digestive system.  While this is not a ______berto's by name, it is of the same style, but I have had no digestive repercussions.    Oh, and the food is actually good!  The burritos are hefty, the rolled tacos are greasy (but in a good way), the guacamole is tasty and even the fish tacos are yummy.    This place is cheap, tasty and on my way home from work.  A TRIFECTA!

I agree with everything that Max A. said about this place.    I went in here not too long ago as some friends really wanted to go for last call.  If you are turned on by watching some pale anorexic looking girl wearing a gas mask dance on a bar, then this place is for you.  If you like bad hair, white belts and crappy tattoos, this is also right up your alley.  I wanted to grab some of the girls in here and just give them sandwiches and some sunshine and tell them that their Daddy did love them.    I won't be going back here, its just depressing.

This place is actually located behind Fiesta Burrito at 1649 N. 74th St. in Scottsdale.  This is just north of McDowell on 74th st.   This is the Mecca for Soda enthusiasts.  They stock so many different styles and flavors that you can spend a good deal of time just walking around and browsing.  You can buy by the six pack or build your own mix pack of individual bottles.  The place is well organized by style and the prices are pretty reasonable.  They have chocolate sodas, coffee sodas and even Radar O'Reilly's favorite, Grape Nehi.  I found a lot of stuff I hadn't seen since I was a kid.  According to their website they were threatened with litigation from Coke and Pepsi so don't expect to find those two on the shelves.  They are closed on Sunday so plan your visit accordingly!

Tessio's Pizza is one of my favorites in the valley.  It is by no means gourmet, but it hits the spot every time.  They have a thin crust, decent sauce, and is always just greasy enough :)  Their sandwiches and sides are good as well.

I have only had the Cheese Soup in a bread bowl here, but it is worthy of four stars.  My boyfriend has had the BLT and he said it was good, not that you can really mess up a BLT.  They have a large sandwich menu, soups, salads and sides.

I really like this Salvation Army.  They always have a lot of books and a lot of furniture to choose from.  They have 50% off everything on most Saturdays and it is pretty well organized.  I love to browse thrift stores for good finds and I have done well on cookware, dishes and books here.  One thing that is kind of annoying is the back corner is sometimes a mess because of toys and sporting equipment being thrown all over the floor.  This makes it difficult to get to some of the book shelves.

This bar is definitely not for trendy folks or people looking to 'be seen'.  It is a nice neighborhood sports bar with good bar food at a great price.  1/29/07 Philly's recently got a facelift and has new tables and they even have booths now.  They have also expanded their menu to include more dinner type meals, instead of just bar favorites.  Wednesday night they have a steak night with drink specials and a reduced price steak dinner.  Of course you can always order one of the many varieties of cheese steak sandwiches, because they are delicious.  This is just a relaxing bar with good food and a friendly staff.

Lo Cascio is a nice little Italian restaurant within walking distance of my home.  If it was not so close I probably would have never noticed it.  I go for the "Early Bird" dinners between 4-6 when you can get smaller portions for great prices.  Everything I have had so far has been good and the staff is very friendly.

I used to feed my 2 dogs the super ultra holistic expensive fruit and veggie mix dog food that I bought at Petsmart.  That is, until I found out it is made by Menu Foods who enjoys poisoning people's pets with toxic gluten!  I did my research and found a brand made in the US with only US ingredients and human grade meats.  I remembered Lauren's review on here and went to the Tempe Feed and Tack and sure enough they had the food and the nice lady that worked there confirmed for us that we were buying some of the best food we could for our pups.  Sure she was trying to make a buck for the store, but they obviously care about animals because she told me they don't stock anything but the premium dog foods, NONE of which contain gluten.  The place is small but neat and tidy.  They have a lot of horse related items but also have a small selection of dog toys and treats.  They have the coveted bully sticks that my dogs adore, so my dogs approve of me shopping here.  Unfortunately for them I bought the 30lb bag of food so I won't need to go back to the store anytime soon.

I like this thrift store because it reminds me of the stores back east where I grew up.  Back east the thrift stores are not all clean and pretty like Savers or the giant Goodwills here in  AZ.  This place also doesn't have as high of prices as the clean and organized stores so you are more apt to find a bargain here.    Gracie's is in an older building along Apache that always seems to have some water leaking and doesn't pipe in scents through the air system to mask the fact that you are buying someone else's old stuff. (I just realized that Goodwill does fragrance the air with cinnamon, I thought I was losing my mind until I noticed it in three separate Goodwills in the valley.)  They always have a lot of nice clothing, housewares and a lot of books.  I was in there recently and there seemed to be a lot less inventory so I don't know if they were just slow on donations or maybe clearing out to possibly renovate.  Getting to the place has been a nightmare recently because of the light rail construction so if you know your Tempe streets I would suggest coming in from the neighborhood behind the store, not off of Apache.  Gracie's is affiliated with Grace Community Church in Tempe and does have some religious literature near the front counter and has an abundance of Christian books for sale on their shelves.

I can't believe nobody else has reviewed this place!  It is THE place to go for import and craft beers.  They have an awesome selection and the prices are always fair.  The best thing is you can mix and match your own six packs.

The Chuck Box has fresh and delicious burgers and chicken sandwiches.  They grill  your food right in front of you and they have a great condiment bar so you can get just the right amount of toppings.

I wanted to wait to review Casey's until I actually sat down and ate a meal there.  I go to Casey's pretty often on the weekend nights to enjoy some libations but I had not actually ate any of the food.    I went today to have lunch with a friend and really enjoyed my Shrimp and Avocado salad.  The service was slow even though there was only one other occupied table in the restaurant area.  The food definitely made up for the slower service.  They have a lot of seafood on the menu as they are an Oyster house. I don't know that I would ever try oysters in the middle of the desert but I hear their Clam Chowder is awesome.   A lot of friends eat here on a regular basis and enjoy it but I mostly go to Caseys for liquid refreshment only.   The only complaint I have is that this place gets PACKED some weekends and the wait for the bathroom can be ridiculous.  I really don't like overcrowded places and Caseys definitely has that potential on any given Friday or Saturday night.

This Serrano's is my favorite because it is cozy, dark and the service is really fast.  I love that you get salsa AND bean dip here, and that both are very good.  The food is seasoned well and if you add some hot sauce it has just enough kick to make your nose run, which is a good barometer for spice in my book.  The food is good and you get a lot for the price.

I have now been here twice in one week and that should be all of the review you need.  The pizza is as good as I have had here in the valley and if you go on a weeknight there is no wait and the service is so fast and friendly there is not one thing to complain about.  I have not gone on the weekend so I cannot say if it gets crowded but the place is pretty small.    They have a lot of varieties of pizza and calzones as well as salads.  I could probably just be sated from the delicious bread that comes with the dinner salad.  I believe it is just small portions of the pizza dough but I cannot be sure.  But I don't care what it is,  it is delicious.   This would be a great date place, especially on a chilly night.  The glowing brick pizza oven is right in the middle of the restaurant and just makes a place  that is in the middle of a strip mall seem very cozy.  As the other reviewer mentioned they have a great wine selection, some surprising beer choices and a nice covered patio.  I had been in this complex a few times and never even noticed this place so I am glad that I read Joe's review and took the time to find it.

The TeePee is good, greasy, satisfying mexican food.  The place is small, the booths are uncomfortable, and the wait can be long, but it is worth it.  my favorite is the lunch special, chicken burro with green or red sauce, rice and beans.  they also recently started serving vegetarian beans for all of you veggies out there.

I agree with the first reviewer that the appearance of this place may turn some people away, but that is all the better for you because you will get a table faster.  If you go on the weekends prepare to wait 20-40 minutes, but it is indeed worth it.  The food is very good and the service is hit or miss but what impressed me most is the wide selection of Vegetarian dishes.  I am not vegetarian but some of my friends are and sometimes I just feel like eating something lighter.  They have a great selection of grilled veggie filled burritos.  You can also get sides of grilled veggies like asparagus, zucchini and carrots.  Be sure to try the grilled carrots.  The parking sucks,  the servers are sometimes not nice and the place sort of looks like something in a bad dream featuring Antonio Banderas and a mariachi band,  but the food will keep you coming back.

I work in the office tower attached to this mall and it is completely worthless beyond the food court for lunch and deals when Dillard's has clearance marked way down.    If you are into all of the trendy, overpriced, overly made up looks of today then this mall is perfect for you.  If you are over a size 10, do not want to spend $60 for a t-shirt, or think Kate Spade is a garden tool, don't bother.  As another reviewer mentioned, this mall is full of 'beautiful' people, as defined by the OC or your local plastic surgeon.  I knew the mall was completely worthless when they removed the bookstore.  Who needs to be able to read more than MAC or COACH.  I gave it one star for the food court and one star because it has an ATM for my bank inside which is convenient for me.

Comfort food in a gourmet style.  The atmosphere is great and the food is delicious.    The restaurant is in the recently renovated Hotel Valley Ho and they did a great job at creating a retro style restaurant with food worth coming back for.

I have not had any other gelato before so I don't have anything to compare this to, but it is DELICIOUS.  I read about this place in the New Times and decided to give it a try and I am glad I made the trip.  I definitely will be going back to try all 18 flavors.  They do let you sample two flavors for free which is nice and they cheerfully decode the Italian names so you know what you are ordering.    As it is attached to La Grande Orange parking can be a pain if you go during peak hours, but it is so worth it.    They do ask that you spend $10 if you want to use your debit/credit card so be prepared with cash if you are going solo and only plan on getting a couple of scoops.  Or consider it a challenge to eat $10 worth and still be able to walk to your car.

I first visited Penzey's in the strip district in Pittsburgh and I had no idea there was one in the valley until just a few months ago.  Penzey's is wonderful if you like to cook.  Heck, it is wonderful if you just like interactive shopping.  Most of the available spices and herbs are set out in jars so that you may open the lid and give it a good sniff before purchasing.  You can tell a lot about a spice and how it will enhance your food just from one good smell.  The prices are beyond reasonable, the selection is great, and they even have their own spice mixes which are wonderful.  I recently picked up their "Mural of Flavor"  and it is so versatile, so tasty and contains NO salt.  As the previous reviewer stated, this place is wonderful for someone who is trying to use less salt in their food but does not want to give up any flavor.  You can get spices in small containers here, so you never have to worry about buying too much and having it go bad.  There are also plenty of extracts and goodies for bakers as well as many gift sets.  If you like fresh and inexpensive spices and herbs, Penzey's may be your new favorite store.

A good friend of mine suffers from Celiac disease so she cannot have wheat products.  She was excited to find this place offers a gluten free crust so we headed over there for dinner.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about what she could and could not have on the menu.  We showed up during happy hour (4-7pm) and they had $2 wine and beer.  $2 for a Peroni! I would go just for that.  I chose a Veggie Medley sandwich and my friends got pizzas and salads.  We were all very pleased with what we got and with the helpful staff.  I would definitely go back!!

I have yet to step foot inside of Lulu's but I have tasted their cupcakes and they are delicious. I am a fan of cake and cupcakes, but I am not a fan of the store bought product that is so overly sweet I feel like I might develop diabetes after one bite.  So my brother picked some Lulu's cakes up for me as I had mentioned reading about the new bakery  in the new Phoenix Metropolitan magazine.  The cupcakes they serve are all natural, but this does not mean they are not sweet, fluffy, and full of flavor.  I tried the "Bunny Boo" which is a carrot cake cupcake covered in cream cheese butter cream icing.  It even had a tiny sliver of carrot and I believe a sprig of parsley on the top to mimic a real carrot.  The cake was flavorful with nice pieces of walnut and the icing was light and fluffy and there was a generous amount of it.  I have a chocolate cupcake with vanilla butter cream icing sprinkled with coconut that I will be having at lunch and I cannot wait.   I am also a sucker for packaging and my 4 cupcakes came in a pretty pink box with a brown ribbon around it.  The price is a little high for a single cupcake ($2.95) but sometimes you have to splurge to get a quality item.  If you buy four it is $10.00.  They are only open 8:30am - 5:30pm, so plan your visit accordingly.

I have gone here a couple of times in the last few weeks and have to say we had great service each time.  We went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and they only had one waitress working but she was attentive, personable and our drinks were always full.    I think the food here is good albeit a dollar or so overpriced.  I have had quite a few items but I can recommend the Red Chili Pork Tacos over everything I have tried so far.  The food is good quality and the salsa is reliably tasty.  These are two requirements for my Mexican dining needs.  Another plus about this place is its sizable patio.  Nothing beats eating outside during our awesome  AZ winter.

My family stayed here this past summer while visiting me and had a great time.  It is a little pricey but it really is a beautiful property and they take good care of their guests.  The pool is a nightmare in the daytime as it is filled with Scottsdale's finest (most obnoxious) rich kids, but other than that it is a fun place.  The restaurants are nice and the staff is very friendly and professional.

This place manages to stay pretty under the radar even though it wins awards left and right in local publications.  The reason I would guess is because it is situated right in downtown Guadalupe.  If you are not sure what Guadalupe is, it is a small community  founded by Yaqui Indians that incorporated their own town right in the middle of Tempe and Phoenix.  The town is now mainly Native American and Hispanic and is about one square mile in size.  The Farmer's Market has an amazing assortment of super fresh produce and they even make their own honey.  Right inside the door you can see some live bees hard at work making the delicious varieties.  Because this market is in an area with a lot of Hispanic residents they carry a large selection of Peppers fresh and dried.  They get a lot of their produce from local farmers and offer some organic choices.  I know some people who are intimidated about going here because they fear the neighborhood it is in is 'different' than their stucco and chicken wire Stepford neighborhoods,  but I have never had a problem going here day or night.  One thing to be cautious of is the fact that this town's speed limit is 25 MPH everywhere and you better observe it.  For one thing there are a lot of dogs and people crossing the street all over the place so the slow speed is safest for everyone.  Also, Guadalupe has their own police and they will not hesitate to pull you over because you think 25 is just too slow.

If you are a food and cooking nut like me, do not go in here unless you have about 45 minutes to browse. I could spend 15 minutes just standing in front of the knife case dreaming of having one of everything.   This store has every little cooking gadget, gizmo and doodad you could imagine.  They have egg toppers, egg cups, 4 kinds of citrus reamers, 20 kinds of spice grinders and 4 shelves of just teapots.  They have tons of specialty ingredients like fancy salts, mustards and jams.  As the other review mentioned some of the stuff is overpriced but a lot of the time you can get some great things for cheap.  Their clearance section always has some deals if you can sift through the mess without breaking anything.  The only thing I don't like about this location is I have to walk past the obnoxious patrons on the patio at Pink Taco to get to the store.  Although, it was funny to hear an older lady ask her son if he has tried the Pink Taco yet.  Ah, Scottsdale.

I went here for lunch this past weekend and I had a very hard time selecting what I wanted, which is always a good sign.  They have pizzas, sandwiches and salads on the menu as well as some specials.  All of the food is geared toward a healthier lifestyle and as Shannon said they give you a lot of useful nutritional information right on the menu.  They have a lot of grilled fish and lean meats to choose from on their sandwiches and salads.  I got an ahi tuna burger and it was grilled just enough and the sauce was spicy but not too hot.  I got their edamame cucumber salad as a side and it was very refreshing as it was a hot and humid day.   We went at an off hour and it was still pretty packed so finding a table during peak times might prove to be difficult.  One  thing I appreciated is that everything is really straight forward and explained well on the menu.  My sister who was having lunch with me went right across the parking lot to Whole Foods to get dried currants after the meal to try to recreate the cucumber salad when she gets home to Pennsylvania.

This is my pizza delivery place when I need something QUICK and reliable.  I love all their flavored crusts and the baked subs are delicious.  This isn't spectacular pizza that is going to change your life, but it is tasty and they deliver FAST and we have never had an order be incorrect.  Try the garlic crust, yum.

I can't believe I have not reviewed this place.  I live just a mile away from this place and I stop there on the way home from work quite often.  The service is great, the food is delicious and when I order to go it is fast and the order is always correct.  I have never had Vietnamese food from any other place so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but I have loved everything I got from here,  even the tripe in my Pho!

I like Sur La Table, I am sure the restaurants are good, but I will not be visiting there anytime soon....  Why?  CUZ IT STINKS!  (or STAAANKS if you are a Chappelle fan)   seriously, I went there in the evening and it smelled like a port-o-john.  I may revisit this review once they 'fix' the smell problem.

I love my library, just don't tell them I don't actually live in Tempe anymore and that I actually live in Scottsdale.  I have been going to this library for years and I have yet to step foot into the Civic Center library in Scottsdale that is closer to my house because I am honestly a bit afraid.  Am I going to be hassled at the door because I am not wearing proper shoes?  Does the reference section contain books only informing readers of the best plastic surgeons, mixed drinks and make up application tips?  I know my Tempe library and it accepts me for who I am.  I visit the book sale area every weekend for the best book deals around.  You can get paperbacks for 50 cents, magazines for a quarter and hardbacks for $1.00.  I find old and new treasures here all the time.   After perusing the book sale area I visit the Connections Cafe which serves up all of your coffee, tea and snack needs right in the comfort of the library.    The staff here is friendly and helpful and the layout is easy to navigate.  I am off to see if there is a review of the Scottsdale Civic Center Library to maybe calm my fears...

This place used to be called The German Corner.  I am not clear if it is under new ownership as the restaurant did close for a while and then opened with a new name.  I went here for the first time last Friday and I was very  surprised at how empty it was.  This is great for me because I really don't like crowds, but it is not so good because I want this place to remain open!  We went during happy hour when they have $2.50 drafts of good German beer.  They also have discounts on mixed drinks, wines and bottle import beers.  All of the appetizers are also half off.  We got a couple of sampler platters and sandwiches and were very satisfied with the food.    The staff was very friendly and attentive.  I have been back since for lunch and the experience was just as good.  They have specials daily that are always well priced.  The food is very tasty and filling and they have a lot of things that I cannot wait to try.  If you go with someone who is not as adventurous they do have a burger, which my boyfriend got and said was tasty.  I like the fact that the dining room is dim, cool and has no windows.  It really creates a nice cozy atmosphere where you might forget that you are in the middle of the desert and when you walk out the door your face is going to melt off.

I ventured the 10 miles to this store as I could not wait for the one to open near my house.  It was definitely worth the drive.  The first thing I noticed was the fact that there were not ads all over and busy clutter overwhelming your senses like regular grocery stores.  Sean M. hit it on the head, it is a lot like a small warehouse store.    They have all the usual staples your supermarket has, even cleaning and pet supplies.  BUT what makes this place special are the good quality food items at very reasonable prices.  The produce is prepackaged but it is all such good quality you won't be getting just one good tomato out of your pack of four.  They have berries, herbs, vegetables, prepackaged salads and their own dressings.  One warning about the prepackaged food, do not assume that this food is fresh and HEALTHY.  The few meals I picked up packed quite a fat and calorie punch.  I am not one to complain when fat is used for flavor, but just be aware that you are not necessarily getting low fat food here.  Speaking of which, I bought the truffle mousse that is made with chicken liver and duck fat and I seriously would consider spreading this on wood and eating it the stuff is so good. Its not even remotely good for you, but its DELICIOUS.    They have a lot of wine here that appears to be bottled or imported specifically for Fresh & Easy.  They also have a lot of varietals you don't see as much in your grocery store for really good prices.  I bought a bottle of Italian Primitivo for $5!  I haven't tried it yet but for $5 I couldn't pass it up.  The checkouts are self serve but the employees bag for you and also are right there to assist if you have any problems.  I don't know about you, but I played store when I was a kid, so the self checkout is kind of fun.  Buying alcohol slows you down as you have to have an employee come over for the age verification.  I give this 4 out of five stars because I think the self checkout is great for me, but not great for everyone.  There were some folks who were noticeably put off by the system.   Also, the beer selection is pretty bad.  They have a nice selection of wines but just your usual green bottles for imports and the crappy macro domestic garbage.  If you want to see what I bought, here ya go:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/dulamae/sets/72157603476018629/

I love Bark Avenue because it lets me feel so good about spoiling my dogs.  I have to confess that my dogs have a blog.  My dogs have a blog that receives 3 times more hits in a day than my personal blog does.  I am one of those people, I am a crazy dog person, I admit it.  I have 2 dogs that are as close to kids as I will ever get , so when I discovered Bark Avenue I was very excited.    They only carry premium, high quality dog foods.  Nothing here was made with tainted gluten from outside of the US.  They carry a wide range of treats and chews and for folks who have their dogs on a raw food diet they offer some raw food selections.  They also have a great selection of toys, leads, harnesses, beds and accessories.  They have products for cats and birds in addition to the large selection of dog items.  There are no pets for sale here, which as Martha Stewart would say, is a good thing.   If you save your receipts after $300.00 you receive 10% off your purchases.  Considering I don't need to be saving for my dogs to go to college or to get their boobs done to fit in with the Scottsdale crowd,  I will probably spend $300.00 on my fur kids in no time at all!

This mall is more my speed than the one closest to my house, Fashion Square.  They have stores that appeal more to me like Old Navy.  They recently got a gelato place and a cool little dog boutique store where you can get fresh baked treats for your pup.  The mall has another unique store that is a favorite of my boyfriend, The Hobby Bench.  The only thing that really bums me out about PV mall is the book store is now gone.

We used to go here when it was Famous Sams  and it was tolerable.  Then we made the BIG mistake of going here when it became Max.  The service was bad and the food was worse.  I will not be going back here.  Famous Sam's was like that uncle you could tolerate because you could always rely on him to make you laugh with a joke full of words you probably shouldn't  be hearing.  Max is like the uncle in the corner that smelled kinda like he crapped his pants and never remembered to put his teeth in.  Just look away and pretend it doesn't exist!!!

I think I have been to Glendale 4 times since I moved to Arizona 11 years ago,  but that number is about to go up drastically thanks to Total Wine.  I love Tops Liquor, I love Sun Devil Liquors, and I love Star Liquor and Convenience.  I love supporting my local businesses and I love to cheer for the underdog, but in this case I am admitting that this store has turned me into a complete and TOTAL (pun intended) sell out.  I am a bit of a beer and wine nerd and my fiance is a bit of a Scotch freak.  We have done all of the ooohing and aaahing at Bevmo! already and I am pretty much over it.   Last night I was perusing Yelp when I saw a review for Total Wine and immediately googled them and got very excited about their catalog and prices.  Tonight we took the long drive to Glendale and it was so incredibly worth it.  The prices were great, the selection was ridiculous and everything was very well organized.  The wines are conveniently arranged by region and variety.  They have information cards for almost every wine, free buying guides, employee picks and critics reviews to help you make your selection.  The beer and liquor prices are great as well and as much as I didn't want to fall in love with a chain store, I did.    I won't stop going to Tops or Star, and I won't be getting WEST SIDE tattooed across my stomach anytime soon, but I will be venturing out to Total Wine as often as I can.

The most important thing to note is that this place shares a kitchen with the good Italian restaurant, Uncle Sals.  We happened to find this place when I was going to Office Max in the same complex.  We stepped in to check it out as the signs outside advertised a large selection of beer and wine to go.  While we were not overly impressed with the amount of beer and wine to go (about 20 varieties of imported 6 packs and about 20 wines), we were impressed with the menu.   I really like Uncle Sals so I knew the food would be good, and it was right up the alley of my picky fiance.  We went here for Valentines day as we figured it would not be too packed, we were right.  They offer some nice wines by the glass and imported beers at a very reasonable price.  The menu consists of burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs (Vienna Beef), pizza, calzones and some sides.  The dessert menu is limited to blue bunny ice cream.  There is a small bar at the rear and about 10 tables.  It is very small and has a nice vibe.  We both ordered personal pizzas and they were very good.  The service was attentive and the food came promptly, even though Uncle Sals next door was PACKED.  I have only been here once to eat, but the first impression was very good.  I wish they would add a couple of salads to the menu as in the summer that is often all I am in the mood for.  I think they need to tweak the menu a bit and I'd like to try it again before I really commit, but for now it is four stars.  I plan on going back soon, even just to have some Peroni on tap!

My fiance and I have had Jersey Mike"s a couple of times and so far we are very impressed. Subs are a food group to him, so I take his opinion very seriously.  The folks that work at Mike's actually take the time to put your sandwich together nicely with a ton of veggies and meat.  It is not like some of the other sub chains where they are trying to play beat the clock and smash your food together with little care or courtesy so you end up with a flat messy sandwich.  The bread is great and the veggies are fresh and ripe, no green tomatoes and wilted lettuce here.  We will definitely be going back!

This is the socially awkward and shy person's dream come true.  Self serve yogurt and toppings with limited interaction with people.  I am one of those shy folks and I love that I can go get some delicious blueberry tart yogurt, add some vanilla wafer yogurt and pay without having to say anything more than 'no I don't want the receipt.'

I don't have to drink Starbucks overpriced coffee anymore,  I will take Dunkin's black coffee over Starbucks any day of the week.  Also, the seasonal pumpkin donut is worth blowing your diet for.

I went in here today and cannot agree more with the first reviewer.  I actually live a few miles north of here and have access to several grocery stores, but I would much rather buy local and support a business helping the neighborhood...but this is not about me!  The store has lots of staple grocery items like pasta, peanut butter, condiments, snacks, etc.  But what is really great are all of the local items like salsa, honey, bread, hummus, and a nice variety of local produce.  Everything is great quality and very reasonably priced, even the specialty and 'gourmet' items.  I hope a lot of folks support this store so it stays in business.

It has been a long time since I have bothered to come on Yelp to rate something, but I really have to weigh in on Gino's.  I recently moved to North Scottsdale and finding this place has been one of the best parts of the move.  Everything I have ordered has been delicious and I have never left feeling that gross OMG I just ate WAY too much and now I will pay for it feeling...and I have ate WAY too much here.  Their marinara, aka gravy, is great.  Their hoagie rolls are wonderful.  I think the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because every time I order an import beer the price changes.  On top of all that I mentioned they have daily specials as well as  poker, karaoke, open mic, massages, jello shots, meat loaf and ribs.  Seriously, what more do you need???  If you need more than that, stay in old town and leave Gino's to us.

My husband has been raving about this place for months and I finally went today.  I kept thinking, its just hot dogs, what is the big deal?  But I was thoroughly impressed and I will definitely go back.  The owner and cook were friendly and our food came out quick and just as we ordered.  My husband is one of the pickiest eaters on the planet, so the fact that this place has him eating sweet and savory flavor combos on a hot dog is enough to warrant 4 stars, and the fifth star is just because it was so darn tasty.

I love this store because they stock high quality food products for my dogs and they take the time to educate people on what they are feeding their pets.  The staff is always friendly and helpful and the prices are very reasonable compared to some of the other higher end pet stores.

My husband has been coming here since it first opened as Brennan's in the 80's specifically to eat the hot sauce.  Thankfully when the new owners took over they kept the recipe and my husband can still get this childhood obsession.  We go here Sundays for football and they are very good about making sure everyone gets to see the games they want and the service is attentive.  I would definitely recommend it for watching a game and having some tasty bar food.

This place and its owner/operators are the best.  Phong and his wife are pleasant, fun, and have great stories.  They have a good selection of import beers and Phong even ordered in something for us that he did not normally stock.  The prices are reasonable and he has all of your convenience needs on top of the great beer and liquor.
