My Family & I came for the Easter Brunch.  The food was great and I was truly enjoying myself.  Until I was asked to hurry and give up my table.    The kids cost more than usual because it was Easter due to the Egg Hunt.  While my kids were doing the Hunt, we were asked to give up our table.  We were offered to stay and hang out in the lounge, but our kids could not.    I would rate the ambiance and food a 4.5, but the customer treatment was definitely a 1.  So I gave an average of 3 Stars.  I feel as if the Management needs a lesson in Customer Service.

My Family and I just got back from a few days in Downtown Phoenix.  Luck Strike was the HIGHLIGHT of our trip.  My 2 boys had such a blast.  The Manager, Nicole Joe, really went above and beyond, making our visit the best bowing, food and drinks experience we had ever experienced.  The drinks and food were all super good, and the lanes were so classy.  The look of this place is out of this world.  Huge flat screens above the pins, super classy lighting and wood everywhere.  Just being in this place makes you feel great.  I just wish this place was in Tucson, because we cannot wait to return.  Thank you Nicole Joe!

We stopped in for Happy Hour and it was freakin' packed-Standing room only.   The happy hour menu was awesome!  $6 for a beer and shot, $3 pretzels!  The visit was brief, as we just bar-hopping....I cannot wait to go back.  Note:  Upon initially looking at the menu, I was pretty much in shock with $36 Ribeyes.  But upon closer inspection, there are actually some decently priced meals.

My wife, my 2 boys and myself were in Downtown Phoenix this weekend and ate at Matt's.  We now have a new favorite. Everything we ordered (Pepper Scamble, Griddlecakes, Waffle, Hog & Chick) was the best we ever had.  This place is like breakfast Heroine.  We are addicted and cannot wait to go back.
