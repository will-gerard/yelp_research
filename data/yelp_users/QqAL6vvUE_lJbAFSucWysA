CLOSED! :(  This place has been closed for about a year now. I'm still not over it. It was my favorite coffee shop to go study at. The atmosphere was calm and they were always playing good music.   If any one finds a coffee shop with a similar atmosphere that is near ASU, let me know!

So the first time I visited Olive and Ivy was a few years back (probably a month after it first opened) I was not a fan at all. However, recently I had heard a few of my friends talking about how good this place was, so I figured it was probably just getting established when I visited before.   Last Saturday I decided to give it another go. And I am so glad I did! I am a fan of all fox restaurants - but this one might take the cake! The atmosphere and decor was perfect for a Saturday afternoon. They had the restaurant opened to the patio and the weather was absolutely gorgeous! Also they had a small band playing music, which was great!  The waitress was a little uneducated about the food and forgot to put in our order for flatbread, but she was nice - so I'll only take off one star. And the food - oh. my. god. The grilled chicken salad was the best I've had so far and the pasta was delicious!  I plan on returning soon. I think this might be a new favorite brunch/lunch spot.

A great family owned restaurant! Their lunch specials are very reasonable. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food. My only request is that they open a restaurant closer to Tempe - I would go so much more often.

So I've been at Solo Cafe for about 2 and a half hours now writing a paper and so far so good!   When I first arrived here I was greeted by a very friendly barista who was happy to discuss the drink options with a first-timer. I settled on a mocha and it was delicious! I like that it wasn't scorching hot - so I could enjoy it right away instead of having to sit and stare at it for 5 minutes.   Also I really like the atmosphere here. The place is pretty small (I like this in a coffee shop - at least until I get here and there's no where to sit). It's also pretty quiet, which makes it a good place to sit and study. My favorite part is that I have been here for a while now and don't feel obligated to leave like some places.   The -1 star is because the chair I'm sitting isn't very comfortable (hahah) but they do have couches, which is probably a better alternative. Also, they don't have a very wide selection of pastries/food. This is always a bummer when I go to a place to study. I'm generally pretty lazy, so I don't like having to stop working to go somewhere else to get food. Despite this I will definitely be returning soon!  (Anyway, my Yelp break is over... back to the paper) :(

I just experienced the best service ever from Dulia (I believe was her name) at La Bocca tonight!  I knew it was going to be a good night when she warned my friend that the Lemoncillo was made with Everclear and very strong. Rather than bringing the drink, she suggested that my friend try the lemoncillo before ordering and brought a small glass of lemoncillo and orangecillo. She was right - both of the "cillo's" were very strong. I decided on a glass of red sangria and my friend a mojito. Both were delicious!   As for food, I ordered the bruschetta and was impressed. Out of the 4 types of bruschetta I ordered, I recommend the proschutto bruschetta. I'm a huge fan of salmon so I ordered the smoked salmon one as well, but was slightly disappointed. Both of my friends ordered pizzas (because on Tuesdays they have a 2 for 1 pizza special) and both of them seemed to enjoy their meals as much as, if not more than I. I anticipate going back soon, especially after seeing two girls next to me get the cookie dessert!  Overall, highly recommended!

When I go out for breakfast I like it to be slightly busy (It makes me feel like I'm making a better, more popular choice). So when I saw there were only 2 other people on a Saturday morning I was a little weary. However, I had been looking for a place with good crepes in AZ and had yet to find one - so I figured, eh, I'll try it out.   I ordered a latte and Nutella & banana crepes. To my surprise it was delicious! I don't remember what my friend got, but I remember her being just as satisfied as me. We kept eating even though we knew that we'd regret the feeling of being overly stuffed. It was definitely worth it in the end. I expect to go here again soon. I just hope it's busier next time - this place deserves the business.

I was really excited to try this place. Was a little disappointed when I looked online and found out it was a chain. The atmosphere was fun, a lot of people, but I wish the music was a little lower. I don't know if I was fighting the loud music or the loud people (maybe a combination of both) but I found myself yelling across the table to talk to my 3 friends.   Our waitress was nice. But she would disappear 15 minutes at a time. I don't think I've ever waited that long for a water. Then it took another 30 minutes to get my appetizer. I didn't order anything else because I wanted to get out of there before midnight.   Then the food was ok. I unfortunately didn't get the chance to try the pizza. I only got a pretzel appetizer - which basically tasted like salt. My friends seemed to enjoy their meals more than I.   The only reason that I would return here soon is after a night of drinking on Mill. Maybe I'll try it again in 3 months once things get better established, at which point I will hopefully have the opportunity to revise this review.
