Food sucked!!! Very bland!!! Plus service was very slow. We were there for 45min. Before we got any salad or meals. Shoulda known better than to eat at one of these corporate owned garbage places. What a waste of $100 !!!!

Glad to see zing opened in downtown Glendale . Have been there twice and have had the same thing, and only because I am a sucker for a good burger. And the burgers are really good!!!! I can't wait to try breakfast. Zing is a welcomed addition to the downtown area.

So after Bice bombed at westgate, I heard there was an attempt to dumb down the place and call it tuscan oven. Being Italian   And knowing real Italian food, this place is an insult to all who care about Italian culture and food.To say the food was horrible would do it justice. Frozen pizza dough, and fake cheese that didn't even melt on the pizza. Guido frys???? Come on , can you insult Italians any more???? And then some chicken dish with, get this, maple syrup and corn flakes on top. I guarantee no Italian restaurant serves this. So all in all, nice attempt to rip off Italian culture with quotations in Italian hanging on the walls, but can't fool people with this food!!!! Good luck
