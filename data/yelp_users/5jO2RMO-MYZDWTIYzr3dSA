This place isn't the best looking, but it's pretty tasty! I find myself craving the strange mix of foods they serve here. I order the Emerald chicken burrito and the Jerk Chicken quesadillas. The best part is if you've never been there before, they give you tons of samples and tell you all about the foods you can order.  I wish they had more locations :)

I *love* this place!!! Their sandwiches are all great (I usually get the Yahoo), and I love their creamy chicken soup that they serve in freshly made bread bowls :)

Nope, I've lost my trust in these people, and they've lost my business.

Everything you order here is sooo good! The clam chowder doesn't have the grainy / sandy bits in it (which I'm always looking out for in a good clam chowder) their perogies are great, and their Jewish Sliders are amazing (but loaded with calories, and pretty expensive, so it's a very rare order) -- basically everything you order here is really good.  The only bad thing I've seen be ordered is: a couple of friends ordered their ribs on their all you can eat night, and they didn't like them. The waitress said the ribs are a hit or miss kinda thing to order, that some nights it's a great batch, and some nights they aren't that good. But the manager came around and apparently other people were saying the ribs weren't good, so she asked them if they would like to order something else instead. So the service has always been friendly as well.

Best prices and a huge selection. I love their single bottles of beer isle where you can mix and match your own 6-pack of beer. Some of my favorite beers I can only find here.

I love this place. Their cilantro hummus and Chicken Tikka Masala are the best!!!

A simple oil change should take 15 min. Since I arrived early and there was only one car already being worked on in front of mine, I was expecting a wait time no longer than 30 min. So I told them I'd wait for my car inside their building.   TWO HOURS LATER.....my car was just sitting there, hood open, wrench on the engine, and absolutely no one in the garage at all.   Lesson learned, I'll just go to good ol' reliable Jiffy Lube next time.

This place is great. I love their chicken gyro, as well as the steak. The lady who serves during lunch is helpful and nice. Always clean, and surprising random stuff on the menu.

My new favorite lunch spot! fast, clean, friendly. Everything I've ordered from the menu has been pretty tasty. I personally like their Arizona bowl, which is like a giant California roll -- bowl style. Lots of avocado included too :)   Sometimes the food can take a while to get to you. I've noticed that when you order a roll, sometimes it's the first thing that gets to your table, other times it's the last, when you've already devoured most of your other food (sometimes I'll get 1/2 a roll with a small bowl). But I only get a 30 min lunch and I'm always back in the office on time.  Being from Los Angeles, I haven't run into too many reasonably priced little Japanese restaurants (as opposed to the high priced fancy fusion places) that serve yaki soba and udon so I'm very happy to have found this place.
