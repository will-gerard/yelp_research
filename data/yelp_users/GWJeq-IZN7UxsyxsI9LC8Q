Now that I am settled in here and have money in my pocket, I am able to actually shop at Rollins.   I come here quite often because it is, as I said before, literally across the street from my house. Being that I don't have a car, it is extremely convenient. There still is not a lot of options, and I've gotten produce there that wasn't quite right, but overall it's not too bad.  The biggest reason I come here is that it is so convenient, however I still have problem with pricing. It is WAY too expensive! Ramen is 49 cents there, when everywhere else carries for 25 cents. Soups are expensive, bread, cereal, eggs, milk, just everything. Sometimes I get a friend of mine to drive me to a different store if I'm low on money because it's really that expensive in my opinion. I wish they would drop their prices slightly.

I mean, if I could give this place zero stars, I would.  I went into Thirsty Dog today because I saw on the Hooked app that they had a special buy 1 get 1 deal. Having never eaten the hot dogs from this place before, I decided this was a good enough reason to try them. To be honest, I had had reservations about their hot dogs prior to this occasion because I had seen the way they were prepared in the times that I've stopped in to get an energy drink or quest bar, but I figured I'm only paying about $6 for 2 dogs so why not try it.  I regret this decision entirely.  After I got home, I loaded my hot dog with my condiments and began to eat it. I wasn't super happy straight from the first bite, the bread was soggy, and the brat was practically mush. I had gotten a 4 Peaks Ale brat, so I figured that maybe because it had been soaking in the beer that that was the reason for the mush. But I take a couple more bites and I just realize that it shouldn't be this soft and squishy and mushy. I look at the brat and lo and behold, it's RAW. I've never seen a brat this pink in my entire life after cooking. It was immediately disgusted and threw both brats away.   I am extremely disappointed in this company as far as the hot dog side of it is concerned. The only thing I'm grateful for from this purchase was that I only had to pay for one.

I went into unPhogettable tonight for the first time and I can see myself going back at least a couple times a month at this point!  It's hard to detail all of the things that made my experience awesome; from the cleanliness, the prompt service, to the amazing food.  But really what made the experience so amazing was the owner, Mr Tieu. Not only was he running around bussing tables, taking orders, and closing tabs like any other employee, but he was extremely friendly. He came over and took the order for me and my friend and he actually spent extra time teaching us a little bit about how pronounce different letters and words in Vietnamese! I've been to many pho places, and many restaurants in general, and I can honestly say I haven't felt that well taken care of by an owner ever.  And even if by some bizarre turn of event the service was bad, it would have been fully made up by the food! The best pho that Arizona has to offer! Mr Tieu even told us that the broth takes 26 hours to make! I believe it because the depth of flavor was phenomenal and the noodles and veggies and tofu were just icing on the cake!  I'll be going back as often as I can. Thank you Mr Tieu!

Ended up coming here for a late lunch/early dinner today because the restaurant we originally intended to go to was closed. I'm very glad we wound up here.   There wasn't a lot of people in there, which I found weird. But the atmosphere was clean and open.   They had happy hour where some of the appetizers were half off so we ordered dumplings to start, and then a plate of medium spicy drunken noodle. The food all came out quickly and was seriously so good! The dumpling had great flavor and were tender, and the sauce they serve on the side was very complimentary to the taste. The drunken noodle was delicious! The noodles were cooked well, the spices were on point, and honestly for a medium it was dang spicy (which I am definitely okay with)!  Everything was priced very moderately and it was a good meal.   The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because, to be quite honest, the service was lacking. I watched our server sitting at a table near the kitchen basically just waiting for people to come in. We sat there with empty waters for quite a while as he sat at the table and didn't get us more until I had to catch him walking by us. And in the beginning it took him a while to realize that we were ready to order despite having placed our menus on the edge of the table. I don't expect a lot when it comes to being waited on, I just think that a little attention goes a long ways that's all.

I've been coming here 1-2 times weekly since I found out about this place 2 months ago!  The food is always fresh and flavorful, the beer selection is good, and the staff is always friendly and welcoming. And they even have good music playing constantly!  I love that you can pick and choose what you want in your ramen; it's extremely customizable.   I always feel very well taken care of here. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would!

I've been coming to E&G pretty much every day since they opened up here.   I had never been to an Erbert & Gerbert's until I moved out here, and I'm glad that I finally got to experience them.  The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming, clean and looks good, the staff are always really cool and nice to me, and I see the manager up at the front talking to customers every time I've ever been.  I've tried a few of the sandwiches and surprisingly I've liked them all quite a bit! Even the PB&J!   Tonight I got the Narmer but substituted the regular mayo for their pesto mayo and added their tasty peppadew mustard. I'd never had peppadew before coming here, and now I can't get enough!  I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good sandwich spot!
