Holy amazing burrito, Batman! I totally forgot my breakfast and this is on my way to work. The sausage, egg and chess were, hot melty and perfect. The hot sauce was spicy with a hint of vinegar. I will be full all day! I was skeptical because the outside was sketchy...but I will be stopping again!

Picture it. Oscar night. Boyfriend's birthday. Reservations made for 530. There was no one in the restaurant, except one other table. We sat in the Piano lounge. It was okay, until they sat 4 young guys right next to us, the were loud , rude and obnoxious. Then our food came out...so excited to have the lobster mashed potatoes, the lobster could not even be poked with a fork. It was so rubbery...Yuck...and then add the increasing loudness of the idiots next to us it ruined our evening. They did take the lobster mash off our bill but I will stick to Fleming's.

Amazing.Service is top notch.Food variety is excellent.Shrimp, ravioli, ham, roast beef, eggs benedict.You name it, it is probably there. The service was good, refilling drinks and taking away plates. A must for the perfect Sunday morning.

I was scared walking in..but once I got inside I was pretty impressed with the service. The prices can't be beat either. I would go back.

The chili cheese dog was to die for...it still had that awesome snap when I bit into it. The taste was amazing. Service was good and cheese fries I got to dip myself. I will be back!

Tried Sunday brunch...everything I tried was better than the thing before it. The chicken blew my mind, the green chili pork was spicy and decadent, cheese grits, biscuits...I could go on..I will...bacon, porchetta, ham, yogurt, fresh berries. The service was on point and it wasn't terribly crowded! A must!

I want to give more stars because the food was pretty amazing. The service was terrible so it diminished my experience and I probably will never return. The service was slow, disintrested and borderline rude, especially for the prices being charged...I expected a little bit more attention. We were never checked on after our food came out, they didn't bring tortillas, it took 20 minutes to get a drink from the bar. We waited a good 15 minutes after the check was dropped for the waiter to pick it back up. It really was irritating how the server would disappear and they weren't all that busy. The food on the other had was good, a little over priced for certain things, but good. The bacon board was fun to share as was the bbq sampler. The brisket was tender and smoky. I wish the service matched the food, then this place would be a winner.

I would not go anywhere else...the artists are amazing and their work is outstanding. I would only trust them with putting ink on my body!  I have gotten several tattoos and a few piercings and have nothing but good things to say about Om!!

Food is eh. Had the ribs, they were grisly. Service was the biggest joke.  You stand in a confusing line where no one listens to you then you get to the register...your meat is ice cold and your hot sides aren't done.Not going back.

Nightmare. I had an appointment at 930am. I showed a few minutes before and then waited over an hour in the parking lot as no management was there to open the doors. I had given them all my info previous to going in so I could expedite the process. The sales person was irritating and kept telling me he just started. I left with no car and their recommendation was to have my car repossessed and do the deal without my trade. Never again.

The service and food were outstanding. The gnocchi with vodka sauce hit the spot. The garlic bread was perfect for dipping in the sauce. My other half had a cold sandwich, the asiago cheese was divine and went well with the meat and amazing bread. This place should be packed! It's truly a little gem!

Yes! Yes! Yes! This coffee was probably the best I have ever had, anywhere. I will be returning frequently. The staff is helpful and friendly and the location and hours are perfect.
