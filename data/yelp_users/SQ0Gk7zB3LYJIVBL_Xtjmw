This place isn't good. The beer selection is okay, but the food tastes like they just microwave everything. I can't bring myself to try the wings b/c the waitress described them as, "Some people like them." It also smells like it was recently flooded.  I had a salad once, and it was actually good. The steak fries are good (but frozen).  Not a fan.

Pleasantly surprised.  I haven't been to native in years, but I was performing at the open mic comedy deal.  After my performance, I ordered a couple of beers and some wings.  They had some good craft beers on tap and the wings were better than I expected.  I remember them being kinda meh and small.  They're still small, but they were cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  And lot of the comics get giving kudos to the 'owner', so I think it's got a good, local vibe.

I will never get ink/toner at an office supply store again.  I save at least $25 every time I get a toner cartridge for my HP Laserjet.  The service with these ladies is unmatched at ANY business I frequent.  They go the extra mile every time to make sure I get what I need.  Don't hesitate.  If you have a blinking red light on your printer, get your cartridge over to Cartridge World!

These guys held my son's car for nearly a week without even looking at it.  Had the BMW toed there on Tuesday.  Wednesday: still haven't looked, you're next, tomorrow morning.  Thursday: still haven't looked, tomorrow morning.  Friday at lunch we stopped in, still hadn't looked at it, we took it with us.  I'm sure these guys are great, but we had a terrible experience.  Do they really think it's acceptable to hold a car for nearly a week w/o even diagnosing it?  What century are these guys from?

Hate to downgrade my previous review, but when I told the manager (new) that I got one of those broken, bloody wings, her response was, "There's always one!"  What?!  Not when I go to Teakwoods or Stadium Club for wings.  They don't serve broken, bloody wings.  So, she thinks it's okay that 10% of my wings were inedible?  Now, I wasn't expecting a credit on my bill, but I would have hoped for, at least, an, "Oh, yuck, I'm sorry.  I'll pass that along to the kitchen."  Her actual response was disappointing to say the least.  Overall, this place is really inconsistent.  I never know what I'm going to get.  Sometimes the wings are undercooked and snappy, sometimes they're perfectly crispy.  Sometimes the wings are coated in luke-warm, gloppy sauce, sometimes the sauce is perfect.  Sometimes they've got a good beer or two on tap, sometimes they choose some crappy seasonal instead.    One thing I can say, is the staff is almost always great, enthusiastic, and make it a fun meal.  And the owner is great.   She owns the two stores in Gilbert.  B-Dubs is a fun place, so we go there regularly despite the shortcomings. I think it's a 'chain' issue more than a local store issue.  Besides, 'Buffalo' Wild Wings is based out of Minnesota.  'Nuf said.

Best Wings in AZ is right!  They take the proven recipe from Long Wongs and deliver it with great customer service.  Order the HOT wings GRILLED and get  treat of your life.  They take great (gourmet) care in every dish.

We literally moved to Gilbert in part b/c of this restaurant.  It used to be SO good.  It has really gone downhill.  The wings are small.  The quality of the food is inconsistent.  The wings used to come steaming hot, now sometimes they're even cold to the touch.  We'll go back on occasion just to see if it returns, but we've been fooled too many times recently.    You can still go to the one in Chandler.  It's still good.  We've had other negative experiences, but I feel too guilty putting them out here in public.  On the positive side, many of the awesome staff are still there, so when management gets things back on track, it'll improve quickly.

They are almost back to their prime form.  As always, the staff are so awesome, they've become friends over the years.  Just great people (unlike Hertz).  The food is nearly back to being great.  The wings are still a bit small, but they are the best-prepared wings around, hands down.  The ranch is awesome, made in house.  The beer selection is good.  We're glad to see Teaks back on the right track.  UPDATE: Was just in the other day, and the wings were phenomenally good. Hope that holds up.

Food is mediocre at best.  The place was filthy, covered in a layer of dust.  They don't take credit cards and force you to use the $5 ATM.  I'd give it one star, but that just feels mean.

Really nice place to grab a breakfast or lunch.  We got there right at change-over from the breakfast menu to lunch (~noon), and we went with lunch.  I had the philly and my son had the burger.  Both were good.  The fries were awesome, my favorite kind.  It's set right in the airport, which is cool.  The staff is awesome, really friendly and fast.  I recommend this place and will return for breakfast!

Best Mexican food in the Phoenix area.  I've been going there for, what, like 10 years?  Still perfect.  Still awesome.  I got two carne asada tacos and the carne asada burrito.  The meat is so good.  The burrito has the right mix of meat, beans, cilantro, and seasonings.  We'll go back for at least 10 more years!

This place is one of my all-time favorite restaurants in Phoenix. It has a really authentic new-Mexican ambiance (and yes, I've been to New Mexican restaurants in New Mexico).  There can be a long wait, but it's worth it.  I always get the carne adovada chimichange with red sauce. Oh, so freaking good. It is spicy as heck, but the flavor is just so deep and perfect. The salsa is also hot, so make sure you've got your drink before digging in.  The Central Ave location has the authentic ambiance, but both locations have the same great food.

Poor, moody service.  The place is religious.  Chicken is bland and dry.  Fries are great.  Gyro is good. 2 gyros, 1 side of chicken: $30.  Ouch! Terrible, distracting music.

First time here. Really liked it. I got the torta ahogada. I think the bread was a little too toasted hard. That's why not five starts. But it was awesome. If you live in Phoenix metro, you've got to try one of these.  My wife had the carne asada tacos. Wow, the meat was so tender, the rice was truly authentic, and the beans had great flavor.  I highly recommend this place.

The good: Great burgers and fish/chips.  Lots of TVs.  The bad: I keep trying the wings, hoping they'll get better.  They're soggy, taste like vinegar, and aren't even hot.  The ugly: Terrible beer selection, but that might be the fault of their customers.  Don't even have Four Peaks?  Give me a break!

Skip this one, and go to the one up the road (Val Vista) near Home Depot.  Could be the same owners, for all I know.  This one is dirty and will screw up your order every time.  But they make up for it by serving it COLD!  They just don't care.  We've been there several times, as we live across the street.  (We get lazy and think, "Well, maybe they're better now."  Nope, still sucks.

I would've given three stars if not for the neglected, dust covered ceiling around the fans and vents. That's not a good sign of cleanliness.  The food: my chili relleno was spongy, the tacos were soggy, and the enchilada had a weird taste. The rice was bland, but the beans were great.  The service was lackadaisical.  Wow, I guess I actually didn't like this place. Too bad. It's been here a long time, and this is the first time we've tried it.  Oh, the chips and salsa were really good, and the place has an authentic ambience.

You need to come here Friday nights. You get some of the best comedy around for only $9-10 bucks. There is a buffet for like $7. There is a live music performance in the waiting area, where there is also a bar and lots of fun people. I highly recommend this as a place to have a super affordable, great time on a Friday.  Full disclosure: I sometimes perform there as a comedian, but everything I say is true and can be validated with one visit.

I've been here twice. It's one of only two places I've found that have good oysters. I love the ambiance here, the oysters are top notch (Texas, you need to visit here and learn what a freaking good oyster is), the fries are good, the warm bread is awesome.  They could use some better brews on tap -- good seafood calls for a good beer (e.g. pale ale).  The service was really good, fast, friendly (unlike Hertz).  My first visit, I also had the soft-shell crab. Being from the DC area, I get these whenever I can find them, and King's' was perfect.

We live nearby and have been here several times.  My wife gets a few different dishes (including kung pao) and I always get the gang pang chicken.  Huge portions, steaming hot, perfectly prepared.  The potstickers are huge and really good.  We tried the chicken wings once -- meh.  There's a spice/herb/seasoning in there that neither of us cared for.  Beer selection is limited, but I guess ya gotta go with a Tsing Tao anyway.  I recommend this place.  Oh, and the owners/staff are awesome.

Holy crap, man, this place is horrible. We went back after like 20 years of not going here, and we were sure disappointed.   First, and this may have been my fault, but the calimari had all these weird, pungent vegetables with it that ruined it.  The service would have made Hertz proud -- it sucked.  And the rest of the meal was just, small, mushy, salty seafood.  Gross!

I'm starting to become a fan of Blue32.    The Good:  The food is really, really good.  I've had chicken fried chicken, hamburgers, chicken wings, grilled chicken...all great.  My wife gets the Mahi-Mahi tacos...loves it.  The beer selection could be better, but at least they've got Four Peaks Hopknot on tap.  The staff is super friendly and great at their jobs.  TVs everywhere if you like sports.  The Okay (there's no bad here): Could use more, better beers on tap.  The salad has chopped tomato on it, which is weird. The chicken wing sauce ain't great.  I'm not a foodie (but I am a Buffalo wing connoisseur) , so I can't identify it, but there's a weird spice in there (cumin?), which floats the taste away from being 'Buffalo' in flavor.  Too bad.  We're becoming regulars here (last chance to save us, Teakwoods!).

I'll bump this place up to 5 stars, which isn't easy for me to do. We hit up a few places regularly here in Gilbert: Blue 32, Teakwoods, Buffalo Wild Wings. Blue 32 gets it right, gets it good, every single time. It's got the consistency of a chain with the quality and service of a local restaurant (and ask for Ashley K and Kala, they are the best!).  Decent selection of brews but could be better (especially now that Four Peaks went to the dark side). The burgers are awesome. The fries are good, but they're the battered kind which isn't my favorite. The wings are cooked perfectly and they're not too big or too small. The wing sauce is not traditional Buffalo, but it's good.  The place is good for watching sports, hanging out with the family, a date, whatever. Just a great, friendly, clean, neighborhood bar.  Don't make me regret the 5 stars, 32!

Having spent two years in Buffalo, I ended up with a Buffalo Wing addiction.  It's hard to find good wings here in the valley (IMHO).  These guys have good ones.  Large wings, great buffalo flavor.  Heck, the owners are from Buffalo.  The steak fries are great, and they've got good beer on tap (I get Dale's Pale Ale).  The staff is awesome.  They make this place a really good, neighborhood bar, which is why you see so many regulars there.  Oh...and they've got Live Comedy on the First Monday of each month!

I really wanted to like this place, but I just never connected with it. Even though I got all kinds of reminders for my training session, my trainer never showed up. Somebody else subbed in but could only do about 20 minutes.  I really hated the cardio equipment. They have TVs on them, right in front of your face. So, if you're not watching them, it feels really claustrophobic - like somebody's got their hand in your face.  The towel service is nice -- towels everywhere. There's only one water fountain all the way in the back hallway.  I've had memberships at Pure Fitness and 24hr Fitness, and this was my worst experience so far.  I can't recommend this place. It's just weird vibe in there.

Jeez, I hate to give a dentist five stars, but I had a great experience in two different visits.  I had to get a chipped tooth fixed, and the Doctor did it like a work of art.  Much better than the previous dentist's work.  Then, I got an exam and cleaning after...a few...years of neglect.  They went to work and didn't complain or make me feel bad about how long it'd been since my last exam.  There was no hard sales pitch.  The whole staff was great, especially the dental techs/assistants.  EDIT/UPDATE: Third visit was just as great. In fact, I let them know I'd messed up and scheduled another meeting right on the back of this appointment. They got me taken care of in plenty of time to make my meeting. Can't say enough good things about this crew.

Been here several times. It' a great place to have a casual business meeting or other meeting.  Okay...so...they drip brew their coffee (or whatever you call it), and it's totally not worth the wait. If you're going to make a small coffee take THAT long to prepare, it better be super really good. It's not. It's just good. Only reason I can't give a 5th star.  There is a stage and they do live performances and open mic.  Great place.

Half of my tree fell into my elderly neighbor's yard, and I wanted to get it removed asap.  Geoff and his crew went above and beyond in getting it done, even though we could tell they were extremely busy (not to mention it was in the middle of the 110+ degree heat wave).  The price was fair, and the work was awesome.

God, it was awful!  First, they sat me at a booth right in the sun, surrounded by booths with no such condition.  I moved.   I ordered the regular breakfast with a side of pancakes and an ice tea: $18.56!  What?  And that's no counting the tip.  Okay...the waitress delayed my breakfast b/c she said the eggs weren't cooked right.  Then, when she did bring it, my over-medium eggs were runnier than French soldiers.  Yuck!  She did get me more, which were cooked okay.  Three tries! The potatoes were undercooked and no longer warm.  The pancakes were good.  The muffins were drive-by buttered.  The service was okay (way better than Hertz).  And they still make you pay at a registers.  What century are we in?

Um, wow. We had a sliding glass door that felt like something out of the Flintstones, like it was sliding on rocks. You know, it took both hands a a foot to open? I thought it was going to cost me a ton of money to fix, but these guys are totally reasonable.   David showed up early, was professional, and is a perfectionist. He made sure our door was perfect. Now, the door glides rather than slides.   Highly recommend these guys.

We finally tried this place b/c of the Groupon they offered, and we live right across the street.  I had the Fried Egg Burger.  It was okay, but the flavors didn't go well together, so it tasted kinda weird.  The real problem with the food was the fries.  They put rosemary on the fries.  That rosemary aroma ruined my whole meal.  What a strange seasoning for fries.  The one really positive thing about the place is that they have O'Dell's IPA on tap.  Awesome.  The service was good.  Three of us dined, and none liked it.  We won't be going back.  The fact that the place was nearly empty didn't help, either.

This is a cool little place, with an old fashioned bar, a stage, and really good food. I got a burger and it was really good. Good burgers shouldn't be hard to do, but so many places get it wrong. It's good here at lunch.  Good place to meet for a casual, non-working business lunch.

I'm a major craft beer drinker.  The beer here was totally awful.  The Irish Red had no malty flavor -- it was dry and empty. The IPA was soapy. The English Browne had no head and was flat. The Scottish Red tasted stale.  When it comes to the aroma, mouth, taste, and color, they only passed the color tests, which makes me wonder what was added to the beer.  We had the calamari, which wasn't to our taste, but it might be fine for others.  The style is like large breadsticks rather than rings.  Just not our style.  I hope this place gets better as Gilbert really needs a place like this.  Wanted to give 'em two stars but couldn't justify it.  [Our waitress was emotionless and didn't care that my English Browne was flat.]

Not good.  The food was luke-warm on a hot plate.  The carne adovada was bland and had a giant piece of snotty fat in it.  The salsas looked like they were reused for me from a past table.  Beans were bland.    Plus, they brought the food out faster than if I'd been at McDonald's.  At least give me the impression you cooked it back there, and at least make sure it's hot!    Really awful, and I'm sorry to say that, as it looks like a local, Gilbert joint.

I'm pretty much done with this place, except that a few friends do drag me in on occasion.  They never have the first three beers I select -- sorry, we're out of that one (even though their beer guy is totally awesome which then points to management/ownership). If you don't have it, take it off the list! The service is terrible three out of four times (like Hertz) -- while that 1 out of 4 times is really good service.  The last time I was there, I ordered the ribs. Oh my god they were terrible! First, no BBQ sauce. Do you have sauce? Oh, do you want that? Yeah! Then, the ribs also include the 'tail' part of the ribs with  the bone pieces and cartilage. Yuck. And, it was chewy/tough, not tender. Man, was that horrible. I think, given that nobody else'd serve ribs that bad, these will be the worst ribs I will have ever had.  The wings have a really weird taste. Cumin, maybe? Trying to be original, but it just comes off as weird.  The fries are good fries, but they under cook them and hit them with cracked pepper. Not to my taste.  Skip this joint. Too many good places around to waste your time/money here (Blue32, Teakwoods, even B-dubs).

We gave this place a try b/c, well, Teakwoods has really been going downhill.  What this place really lacks is an identity.  We couldn't figure the place out.  I had the Scorpion burger, which was really good.  Fresh jalapenos, cooked perfectly, excellent bun.  The chicken wings are good but aren't 'Buffalo' flavored -- more southwest flavored.  Small beer selection, but they make up for that with the locals: Four Peaks and San Tan.  Overall, not bad, more 'meh,' but didn't do enough (likely) to get us back there.

This place surprised me. I had the slice/wings/soda combo.  The wings were surprisingly good (surprisingly b/c very few restaurants around AZ seems to know how to make good Buffalo Wings). These spent a few too many minutes in the fryer, but they were good sized, had good sauce. I liked 'em. I'll likely come back for a full order of those.  The pizza. Wow, be careful. The slice is freaking huge, so huge they bring a pizza slicer with it. The size was huge, but the flavor was a bit lacking -- more garlic! The italian sausage wasn't good. It's those little sausage balls, rather than good sliced sausage (or even chunky sausage like Chicago pizza). This was more like frozen pizza sausage. If you're in the mood for a slice and you're hungry, I'd still recommend this place. Just maybe go with pepperoni.  I ate in.  Good place. Friendly staff. There's a big window where you can watch the guy toss the pizzas. Nice surprise there on the 87 in Chandler.

I really like this place. I had...how could I not?...the Pat Tillman. I think it was roast beef, cheese and mozzarella sticks (on the sandwich). Really great flavor. The place got really busy right after the noon hour, so plan ahead. Huge menu.   I went there b/c my friends are vegetarians. These guys do just about any sandwich to meet your dietary needs.  And, they seem to have a good, healthy attitude there. You'll know what I mean when you visit.   Too bad Hertz can't run it's company like Ike's.

I was on the fence between 3-star and 4-star, but the other good reviews caused me to give the benefit of the doubt.  I dined in and had the orange chicken lunch.  What I really like about this place is the authenticity.  They're all speaking chinese back there (you're not greeting by some bubble-headed teen like some chinese places).  The orange chicken was really good.  The not-so-good: the place smelled kinda funky.  The rice was dry, but think that's just the style, and I prefer the gloopy rice.  The spring roll was cold by the time I got to it, even though the rest of the meal was steamy hot.  I'll probably go back.

Had the gyro and fries. They gyro was very good, overflowing the pita with meat. The veggies were fresh, the sauce tangy. Good sandwich. The fries were good, just not my style -- those battered fries. Coke machine was a bit foamy. Napkins are scarce -- kept at bar/soda machine, not tables.  Lot's of TVs and good beer on tap. The place has a good vibe.   The staff was really friendly, not too talkative, and quick. Awesome (unlike Hertz for sure).  I'll be back.

Sorry, but they just heated my food up in a microwave right in front of me. It was good food -- chile relleno with rice and beans. But they nooked it to like lava hot, like only a microwave can do.  I stopped in after a meeting at the coffee shop next door. It was like 6pm, and the place was empty. Should've been a warning sign to see it that empty.

I was hovering between three stars and four.  I ordered the Italian beef, hot peppers, dipped/wet (forgive me, I'm not from Chicago).  It was really good, but the beef was a little tougher/dryer than others I've had around the valley.  The peppers were good.  The fries were perfect and that fry sauce is great.  I'll be back to try the burgers and dogs.

I had a carne asada taco and a carne asada burrito.  The good: Their sauces are great, especially the green (avocado, jalapeno). The meat is very tasty, well seasoned. The staff is awesome. The ambiance is perfect: not too loud, very classy.  The not-so-good: The bean/rice filling in the burrito was not hot; the carne asada could have been more tender; I wish the salsa bar had whole jalapenos  Overall a good place, and I'll be back. It's a great lunch place to sit down and enjoy some good Mexican food.

Man, this place SUCKED! The only reason it's getting a second start is b/c at least it was clean.  The wings were terrible: hardly any sauce on them and the sauce they did have were just a shade shy of being pure vinegar.   The waitress was horrible. A food runner brought our food, and the waitress never came back to check on us. So, she didn't find out 'til it was too late that they'd forgotten my fries.  The beer selection is horrible -- all football beers. For a neighborhood bar to have such a poor selection is too bad.  The seating is weird. It feels like you're on top of the tables next to you -- no privacy at all.  My wife didn't even eat her food (fried shrimp, I think?).  Ugh, I was so disappointed. Really wanted to like this place.
