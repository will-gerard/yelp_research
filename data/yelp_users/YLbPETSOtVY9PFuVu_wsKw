The food was descent especially the pretzel bites! Service was ok at best.  The bathroom was dirty and unattended to.  Just didn't seem like the place was run well.

My absolute favorite is the Rosa Pizza. I have tried almost every pizza here. The service is fantastic, atmosphere is very cool with brick walls and exposed rafters it just gives it that Rustic feeling of sitting in  a small Italian village. There are a few reasons why there will be wait in the evenings especially on the weekend. They don't take reservations do get there early or plan on hanging out across the way at the wine bar. Enjoy!!!

I was looking for something healthy to take home and eat. I didn't feel like making anything for me and my 10 year old. Nice girl who waited on us, however I didn't realize she was up selling my 10 year old. I ordered a salad with chicken and avocado mixed baby greens, maybe two raspberries. So, they were generous with lettuce, and nothing else. There was hardly any chicken on my $13.00 salad. Goat cheese? Where? Oh there is a piece of that. So, moving forward, my son ordered pancakes. First of all he's 10 and looks it. She also sold him fries without asking me. He didn't  even finish his $12.00 pancakes. I left and called back to ask how my bill was 35 bucks for pancakes and a salad. No less she shouldn't have sold him adult menu, or she should of asked. Now I'm stuck with 10 dollars on 2.00 pancakes!  I will never go back the food was descent, at best. Prices, ridiculous.

The reason for only two stars is not because of the food. I ordered the Quinoa dinner and it tasted great with fresh vegetables cooked perfectly. We had bruschetta which was served very interesting, you had to make it yourself so to speak it was served with the bread on the side of a bowl of Tomatoes.  We had two waitress's who seemed to both disappear when it came time to eat... We asked for bread with our dinner and it came after we had finished. She mentioned it needed to be cut was why it took so long. No apologies. Also when we didn't have silverware it was because it needed to be rolled. It was odd service to say the least. The waitress kept putting her hair up and down playing with it, I found that in poor taste. I would have enjoyed it more if the service was better.

A group of us wanted to get together for my boyfriends birthday we decided to try Fuego Cantina out as it was a great meeting point and heard mixed reviews so we  wanted to see for ourselves... Glad we did. Started with Firecracker Shrimp and some chicken wings both had a unique flavor with great dipping sauces. I had a grilled chicken burrito which was not only delicious but also huge! The salads were amazing with lots of yummy ingredients fruit walnuts cheeses etc. I like the presentation and atmosphere is festive.. Our server Holly was incredibly attentive and patient. She really made our night fun and never wanting for anything. We will be going back for sure!
