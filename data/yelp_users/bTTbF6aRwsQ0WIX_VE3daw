The locker rooms are filthy the equipment. Is falling Apart and the weights are dirty.    The front desk staff are not friendly.    Been going to other gyms and I will drive the extra mile for cleanliness and friendly staff

This was the most disorganized mess   I will never go back.  Even when they gave us free tickets for the inconvenience that the performer loni love canceled.    I wonder why she canceled.
