I have to give major kudos to our server here. We rolled up at 9p per the Yelp listing happy hour times. Come to find out that 9 is the weekday happy hour and Fri/Sat's happy hour doesn't start until 10. We we're okay with this but our server spoke to the manager without us even complaining or asking him to and honored the 9p happy hour because of the Yelp listing.   Now to the food and drink.  If you love cheese, their cheese menu was very large. We got several of the cheeses, the Tres Freres was my favorite (non-happy hour item though). The pork empanadas are a must and the happy hour drinks were very good as well. The strawberry sunset martini was very yummy.   I'd say the happy hour items are where it's at overall. The food was great the drinks were good. Really given their menu and atmosphere I was really surprised that it wasn't more busy. It's kind of sad to see many of the Phoenix area restaurants kind of dead at 9pm on a Friday night. I'm guessing if it were located in Scottsdale that would be a different story.

The coffee is good, the sandwiches are great and the cupcakes are amazing! It's hit or miss on seating. I have know some people who have had a hard time connecting to their wifi but I haven't had any problems.

Our order: Pork chili verde  French onion burger (approx. $25)  Paying for atmosphere versus food and neither are worth the price.

The linguine and white clam sauce is really, really, really yummy as is the chicken marsala.   The pizza is amazing!!! Much better than the other pizza joint that has had a lot of hype and a 2 hour wait.  The wait can be long here but we are usually early eaters so have no problems.. The staff is awesome and very friendly.

This place is great if you like any type of Mongollon BBQ. The meats and selection are really good and they give you options to have chicken wings and cream cheese puffs. The price is really good as well.  For $10, all you can eat plus a drink is pretty nice.

We went to True Food on Camelback for lunch. My husband had the asparagusand smoked mozzarella pizza ($11) and I ordered the steak tacos ($14).  While the food was good, it lacked in flavor. I am sure the finest organic ingredients were used but the beans that accompanied my street tacos were probably the tastiest part of both meals.  For the price and the portion size I would not recommend the same things we ordered. It might be my fault for ordering the steak tacos at a "shi-shi" restaurant but to be fair at $14 I was expecting the best steak tacos I've ever had. I mean at least filet mignon quality meat. At best the meat was a crusty black-seared ribeye, which isn't bad but could easily be made at home.  Cheaper and tasty alternatives: Two Hippies Pizza Shack and America's Taco Shop, both not too far away.

My husband I have tried most all of the Two Hippies in the valley and have loved them all. This was no exception.   $5 burger and fries, $6 cheesesteak and $2 2 liter of soda.   This Two Hippies is very spacious and the staff was very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back.   Oh and a plus unlike the other Hippies joints, this one takes Amex and other credit cards!!!

For someone who loves Chipotle and Pei Wei style places this is pretty similar in atmosphere and just like Chipotle and Pei Wei, it's just a step up from fast food but below sit-down restaurant.   The food was pretty good. The guacamole on the burger was very fresh and it had green onion.   I can't wait to go back to try a burrito or a Nogales dog!  Our meal: 1 Burger w/guacamole and onion 1 Double burger with bacon and jalape√±o relish 1 Fry 1 Onion ring 2 drinks -------- $20.50
