Dr Kelly is a consumate professional with a great caring attitude about his patients.  From the minute you walk in the door you are greeted so pleasantly (you almost forget you're at a dentist!) Dr Kelly and his entire staff are wonderful!!

Although, I really liked my lash extensions and Patrice, I purchased a pre-pay to get my fills, and now they've closed SHOP!!!

Went to dinner for the first time at Soi 4 last night.  The decor and ambiance is amazing.  Great for a romantic date.   The service left a little to be desired.  It took quite a while for us to be greeted by our server and be served our drinks and it wasn't busy...at all. The food was delicious!!!  I had the duck breast in red curry on baby spinach with pineapple and red pepper.  Such flavor!!  I can't wait to go back again and try something else!!

I truly enjoyed my experience with Holly at Face It Skincare!  I received a derma-planing treatment along with a lovely facial!!  The product line she uses smelled awesome and my face was loving every second of it!!  It was hard to keep my hands off my face after I left!!!
