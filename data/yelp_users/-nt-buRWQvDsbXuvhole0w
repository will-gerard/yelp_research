It does not surprise me that there are so many negative reviews for this Safeway. This is the worst staffed Safeway in the valley. I stop here often and it is always the same. Expect extended waits because there are NEVER enough lines open.

This place has really gone downhill in the last few years.   When I first moved to the area it seemed like a cool place to go to. Lately the prices for their events have really gone up, the entertainment is trying to be shocking (but lame) and it just is starting to get sticky. The crowd thinks they are artsy but it is more like a half-assed S+M club in someones back yard.   After going here about 15 times since 2004 I do not think I will go back.   oh and be careful about where you park. The neighborhood has gotten shady.

The aroma from the bakery is a true delight.   I think I have tried almost everything at the Albertsons bakery and it is consistently good. Everything but the doughnuts. They just can't seem to get them right.   Here is a tip: at the other end of the store is a rack where they sell the about to expire items. These are almost as fresh as that days items but usually is one third the price.

With Safeway it seems really hit or miss.   Some branches are great, clean, fully stocked, staff helpful but other branches are the opposite. (see my review of the Central Phoenix Safeway) This store is never prepared and always seems out of stock. Plus they have shorter hours too. I dropped in around 9:30PM and they were getting ready to close down. I like Safeways selections and brands but I was disappointed with this store.

Expensive and not worth the hype  for its prices I was not very impressed with the food. The atmosphere was almost like a fast food place. Very bright and flashy. Not the subdued atmosphere that one would expect from a classy restaurant. We had heard from a freind that it was supposed to be great food but we were part of a 14 person, multi-course feast where we had a little of 15 or so dishes and we were not impressed by most of the dishes.   I think just about and Chinese place will do much better, even Panda Express.

Every time I enter a Walmart I die a little inside.   My main complaint is with the optical department. I was there waiting for an Rx to be filled, decided to browse the glasses and the 23 year old that probably lives in his mothers basement offered to tighten up my glasses (that I was wearing). Really, he brought it up, then when asked said it was going to be free. All he did was take them into the back room, they did stay up better....but then, literally less than 5 minutes later said it would be $5.00. Long story short I choose to pay since I feared security was going to hassle me on the way out.   Additionally I do not see why people say Walmart is so cheap. Really, occasionally I find good bargains but I can find prices just as good in many other stores.

The food is OK, but over priced, crowd is 20's to 40's and semi-biker-ish, the service is all right, but the staff seams shady.   I am not sure what is going on with the people who work there but we have a friend that lives nearby and I have (reluctantly) been to Azools several times.   Once the bartender picked up my money then claimed he hadn't, asking me for more money, a few minutes later saying he had forgotten he had already picked it up. Another time the owner followed us out to the parking lot claiming we had not paid, then walked away before my friend could even respond. Going back in to clear things up the owner pretended like she had no idea what we were talking about. Another time we had placed an order, in a very short time something completely different was placed in front of us and the waitress very quickly exclaimed "Whats wrong? THIS is what you ordered!". Her response was very immediate and sounded rehearsed. I think it might have been a miss-order from one of her other tables she was trying to guilt us into paying for. We only go there because there are little other options in the area.   Some times the service is average but we have are so many such incidents it makes me think there is something shady going on. My friend has said other local merchants have other such odd stories about the owner and restaurant. Normally I don't eat at chain restaurants but when I visit I prefer the Chilles next door by default.

Trys to be high class but does not deliver   First off the fried artichoke hearts were pointless. Flavorless, mostly uneatable husk and overpriced. The steak was average but it did not make up for the flat cole slaw. The chicken salad was good but everything seemed pricey for the quality. Most of all the location tried to be high class but it stopped short and the service and menus, table settings, ect were more like a diner.   We do not think we will be returning.

on time, a little messy, the driver was courteous and got me to my destination quickly. I paid in cash, a lesson I have learned form other cab rides where I had been over charged, but the experience was good.   The 4 rating is due to a somewhat icky cab and the slightly late pick up time. I took a second cab company 2 hours later to go back to the original destination and they charged my half as much. I was going to call to find out why but did not have the time.

I had heard great things and saw lots of 5 star yelps but I was not impressed.   The time we were there, there was either a hipster, wanna-be convention in town or there is a community college nearby. Well the people who work here certainly think they are cool.   It is open until 12Midnight and I would be curious what the crowd is like then. The floor is set up like a dining hall, not a bar (no real mingling space, long German style tables on a tightly packed floor) [might get rowdy in a good way]. The selection on draft beers was mildly impressive but they were out of the German Lager I wanted....but Guinness will do. The food was somewhat pricey and my dish, Veggie Rosemary Chicken, was bland.   People seemed festive but I think I will try somewhere else next time.

large menu, good vibe. I liked it but would not rave about the food.

This is strictly a Spanish speaking restaurant.  It is not like the service we received was less but our waitress did not understand a word of English and the only people there were speaking very loudly about bar room brawls and "pulling guns" on guys who were hitting on their "girls". I in no way think this is reflective of the owners or staff but I bring it up so yelpers can decide for themselves if it is a family friendly location. I would not want to take kids there. The potions were good, but the quality was average. I did not dislike this place but would try to find a better restaurant next time. The neighborhood seemed fine but I was frightened by the activity in the parking lot.

Mega better than the T**o B**L right around the corner.   And as opposed to the chain "Mexican" place around the corner this place was not at all crowded. Really people how can small, locally owned businesses survive if everyone just acts like cattle or sheep and flocks to those crappy chains that do not even have meat in their meat (look it up on Google).   Very big portions, not incredibly tasty (hence the 4 not 5 stars), but good tasting. A person can get filled up on $5.00 and the platters for $7-8.00 will leave you enough for supper.   One thing I think they can improve is a condiment bar. They only had some red sauce and very hot green sauce. Maybe some Pico de Gallo or mild salsa.   If you are in the area for lunch, drive the extra few feet around the corner and eat real Mexican food instead of the corporate crap!

The prices are definitely for The Boulders crowd (very expensive).   The simplest burgers are $10.00 and most are around $15.00. Well the burgers got there fast and were good. But I question the over $30.00 for two burgers....and that was without drinks!!  I am pretty sure my waitress was more concerned about socializing than doing her job. We were 1 of 6 parties there and there were 2 waitresses and one guy behind the bar with 1 hostess.
