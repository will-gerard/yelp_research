The bartender and hostess were wonderful; they greeted us promptly and we were provided timely service. Unfortunately we had a clear view of the kitchen which made it difficult to order food (see photos) I'd like to say the view changed but it only grew worse. At one point the guy preparing the salad mashed down the trash with his food prep gloves on and then continued to make salads : (   We have always loved the other pita jungles we  went to and I sincerely hope this was just a rare occurrence.   What appeared to us to be the manager (as he mentioned being shorted on the alcohol that he had ordered) walked past this area of the kitchen more than once & didn't seem to give it a second thought. However we did notice (just as we were closing out) that someone did come in and start to sweep the kitchen. So it is quite possible that he said something to them off to the side and they begin to address the issue after we left.

I need to provide an update on my last reported feedback. Not only is the Internet working, they have added work spaces with elevated desks that have individual wall outlets and USB charging ports. Thank-You Mark Kia for making these upgrades

The kitchen closes at 9. They don't have Captain Morgan, Sailor Jerry, or Kraken... and they close at 1am on Saturday :(

Krystal was amazingly supportive in helping me understand the consignment process. She took the time to answer all of my questions and explain how everything would work during the selling process. It was truly refreshing to finally meet someone so focused on saving brides money instead of the many other vendors out there trying to figure out how they can squeeze every dime out of you.   I wish her lots of success in her endeavor to provide beautiful dresses for brides at a fraction of the cost.
