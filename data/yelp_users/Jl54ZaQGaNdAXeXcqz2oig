I came to this Home Depot couple months back but never wrote a review. When I came to this Home Depot I bought over $1000 worth of material to build a fence for my backyard. I've had the worst service I've ever had and probably my whole life. I bought a bunch of fences and it took them over four hours to take him all the way to the front. It was it due to high busyness in the store for the store was pretty empty. Who is the lack of employment that was inside the store. To where you can barely find any of employees that could help you with anything. Yet there contradicting their own logo as in how can I help you. I actually drive miles out more further to different Home Depot just so I can get the right customer service that I'm looking for. I would recommend this Home Depot to anybody I know it's a franchise and everyone knows what Home Depot is but this Home Depot is as if it wasn't part of the other Home Depot's I feel like they do their own thing and it's horribly managed. It's sad to say but now I understand that everything points to the leaders of a business.

Skyharbor is one of the best airports in Arizona. If you're looking a place to hang out while you're leaving State you might want to take off from here. They have great restaurants and coffee shops on the inside of this airport. Very clean on the inside. If you're leaving from terminal four I suggest you visit Lola coffee shop. Every time I leave him hanging out in there. I also hang out at Lolos chicken and waffles. I hope this review help guide me and like me

I know all LA fitness is our kind of like the same set up but I didn't like this LA fitness compared all the other ones. I would have to rink at this location as a below average drinking. The set up inside at this LA fitness is like a huge warehouse. You don't have the right environmental feeling that you're in a gym. All the equipment inside that LA fitness is actually old and ghetto and needs to be replaced. It smells really bad inside their Sonos and in their locker room. I don't recommend that you go to this one but I would recommend that you go to one on 83rd. I highly recommend that you make that switch due to the equipment there in the cleanest that they have. I hope this review helps you guys into making wise choices hope you enjoy your workouts. Please follow or add me for friends

This is one of the best Chinese restaurants you'll find in this area. They give you fat portions on such discounts. Come during their lunch special from 1230 to 5. They give you soup and after that they give you rice with your choice of chicken and egg roll and chips all for seven dollars. You can't find anything like this anywhere else.  And they have the best orange chicken. It's no Panda Express. It's full of chicken on the inside with authentic  sauce

Ordered the Orange chicken and egg drop soup. Egg drop soup was pretty good but the orange chicken tasted kind of different. It's probably more of an opinion from my end but there are other places out there better than this place. Also the place is pretty dirty that's were really turned me off. The play is that they served my food odd came with dried food particles from previous orders :/ gross

What are the best pho places in Arizona!! I was surprised how good this place was. You can't judge a book by its cover and same with this restaurant does it look like it's the greatest place but they sure prove you wrong. Also their soups are super cheap they start out at $4.25

This place has pretty good pho in Glendale glitters! If you're downtown Glendale if you're looking to get some soup this is a good place to pop into. I do recommend them  I give them 1 thumb up. The only thing I didn't like about them was that they did not give enough  beef. So if you do order from this place they give below average on the beef so you might want to ask them for extra

I've been to many locations of all Walmart and I must say that this is one of the finest locations I've been to in all of Arizona. This location is probably the most recent one that they have planted in Arizona. This location is probably one of the most cleanest and one of the most well run and Walmarts in all of Arizona that I've seen so far. The employees there are very patient and very helping. Very quick to come and ask to see if there is any help needed. In the greeters always have smiles on their face willing to put you up and in good in a good mood. The bathrooms are very nice and makes it comfortable and you using it before taking a long journey up north. Also the plaza that it's located and is a very popular plaza where many popular stores are located.

I just want to add a couple photos that I found recently in my phone from when I was at Walmart. It's always very clean and very organized inside Walmart stores. But in case you've never heard of Walmart I have two photos to show you how clean they really are on the inside. They have people that are always cleaning the store no matter what happens inside. Whether there was a spill or whether stuff was knocked out or misplaced. There's always people walking around fixing things which is what I like about Walmart. Well organized and run the business. You won't go wrong if you're looking for something in second-guessing if it will be in there. Walmart is one of the most biggest grocery stores that you will find and all of America. I'm sure that Walmart is the number one store and will always be for a long time

This LA fitness is one of the nicest LA fitness is that I've been to an all of Arizona. LA fitness is a well-known fitness center with a great quality and great employees. I would pick Ellie fitness over every other fitness. How's everything from swimming pools to Jacuzzis to Sonos to big giant locker rooms. It's everything you want inside a fitness center. This building is a two-story building with treadmills and all the bikes on the second floor and on the  first floor you have all the heavy weightlifting/yoga mats. Also inside the first floor you have a full on basketball court. This location is actually very clean location compared to the other LA fitness is a scene in Arizona and well organized. If you're looking for a good gym and you live in the arrowhead Loop area this is probably one of the best gyms for you to actually go to.

It's not my first time going to chipotle but when I came to this location with my gf we ordered chicken bowls and my girlfriend found bones in her chicken. She totally lost her appetite!!! It was freaken disgusting. I'm not saying that if you come here you'll have chicken bones in your chicken but I'm saying be careful if you have little ones and check there chicken before they eat. Honestly you never know what you'll find. I've always like chipotle because they have very fresh food but this really turned me off. Because now I'm questioning how they're preparing the food or where they're buying it from. I'm not a Chipola hater. I like it a lot. But this experience really messed me up. Just a warning to everyone that normally goes to this location.

Came here with my family and had dinner. Food was good but to little of it on the plate but that's not why I gave a low review. Had to do with the servers. I came to a high end restaurant and paid big bucks. The server didn't assist us with any napkins till we asked at the end of the meal when we needed them. Also asked for lemons to go with the salmon special and never got them but did feel asking a second time and waiting for them while my food was getting cold cuz it was chilly out. Other then that prices range from 21-30 bucks a plate good food. Very nice resort! Good hang out for a Friday night or Saturday with live music

What I ordered was actually pretty good I'm not going to complain. It's better than a lot of other places as well. I wrote a bad review another good egg that I ate up but it's probably just the food that they serve me at that place. This what I ordered is actually really good and I would recommend it it's not bad it's better than any I hop out there or Denny's for pretty much the same price. It was pretty feeling as well. The service was nice as well and I have to think the manager from the downtown location she hooked me up with the free on the house breakfast lunch or dinner I just want to give a shout I'll turn say thank you for changing my mind away I think about the good egg. Just because one a bad experience does that mean it's always going to be bad.

This is just like any other wall more but it's in the horrible location. The employees are very uneducated, dirty, impatient. This location of Walmart is very near to my home but it's very upsetting of how unhelpful all the employees are. It disturbs me that I have to go to this Walmart sometimes due to that it's so close to my home. Sometimes I decide to go to other stores that are more expensive than to go to this Walmart due to the customer service. I thought I would never make decisions like this just to take customer service but I guess customer service goes along way. I wish that the CEO or the managers of this Walmore would really take this highly within consideration and hiring the right employees. It would make the biggest difference by just hiring well mannered employees that know what they're doing. Thank you

This $.99 store is very close to where I live. The store has saved my butt so many times and save me so much money on things that I would've spent so much more morning at Walmart and other stores. I saved a lot of money on dog supplies and dog toys by just spending a dollar per toy or even for snacks or treats for my dog. Also does dollar store is good with cleaning detergents and stuff to clean your house and smelling good. Also this $.99 store is good for snacks and drinks for parties. You can never go wrong with being a dollar for any kind of product if you're just looking for something simple.  If you're looking for high-quality stuff this place is not the place to be but if you're on a huge budget like I am this is the place you're looking for

Cartel coffee has some really legit quality coffee that a lot of people look for now these days. Cartel coffee is a very highly of modern hipstered coffee shop in the central of downtown. I visit this place once with my girlfriend and I must say the quality within the coffee is rich and strong. I highly recommend this coffeeshop over any coffee chains out there. You will not get this quality in any coffee from Starbucks or any other chains out there. This place is one-of-a-kind and you are guaranteed top-of-the-line customer service.  I hope you enjoy this review and hope it helps you make a decision and what coffeeshop to visit in the downtown Phoenix area. As I continue my journey's in finding the best coffee shops in downtown Phoenix I will be keeping everybody updated please add me to keep in touch.  Thank you

We've been looking everywhere for rings we have been to London gold, Kay, jarred and I feel like all of them are just business people trying to sell what they think we'd like rather than what we want... They don't even listen to what where looking for they pretend they know what they talking about but they don't even listen.   But the moment I walked into this jewelry store Daniel treated us with such respect this is a family owned jewelry shop where all the family members work you will receive top quality customer service and he will do anything to help you find what you're looking for. Everyplace we've been too had bad cut Marquise's and my girlfriend didn't even like that style but when Daniel showed us one of his cut Marquise's it blew our minds this custom jewelry shop has the finest cut diamond we've found in Arizona.   Not only  do they have engagement rings but they also have  everything from watches to necklaces and earrings. They also fix jewelry and watches at great prices.   If your looking for a great jewelry and want to be treated like family DEFINITELY come into Vjeweler

Elevator is a great coffee shop and the Norterra plaza. This coffee shop is unique compared to other coffee shops . They have live music sometimes at night. But it has a lot of square footage to wear a lot of people can be in there. Also they have a lot of room outside. A lot of my friends and people that live in that area are always hanging around at the Norterra area. They have Wi-Fi that you can connect to for free and a lot of people go there to study or just to hang out. Create hang out spot if you're looking for great coffees and teas and pastries have good prices. The owners of this coffee shop are great people. The employees are always happy and willing to help and serve you in anyway possible to make your day a better day. I hope you would visit this coffee shop one day and that this review would be I hope to you. Thank you and add me as a friend if you like this review

This place has great pizza with amazing garlic french fries. I discovered this place off of Groupon where you can get 10$ deal worth 20$. It's totally worth it if you catch it on Groupon. I do recommend this place especially the location in central Phoenix! Very cool environment

My all-time favorite gas station is going to have to be this QT right next my house. QT gas stations are the number one most biggest gas stations you'll run into. And they are by far the cleanest as well. They also have a really big convenient store. But the thing that beats everything is there gas prices. They always have their gas prices a little bit lower than everybody else. I say that QT is the Walmart for all gas stations. They have big space, clean places, and cheap prices. You can never go wrong when you're going to a QT gas station. I know some younger people that come here just to hang out because there's a lot of space where you can park your cars and show your cars off. They even opened up A small snack bar where they sell the smaller portion meals.  No I haven't ate at this little snack bar but I'm sure it's good. But by far this is my number one favorite gas station and if you haven't been here yet you need to check it out

Chipotle is my number one top fast food place to eat. I'm always in the mood for chipotle due to how good and fresh their food is. There's nothing on the market that's as fresh as chipotle for the price you get. Chipotle has come to be one of the most powerful and fast-growing fast food chains in America. My friends and I have all agreed to chipotle is number one on our list as top fast food chain in America.  Not just that but the most healthiest that I would say out of my Opinion. I try to eat healthy at times so I'm not gaining weight. And by me keeping up on my way I normally make the decision of going to chipotle rather than McDonald's or other burger fast food places. If you're looking for a place where you can get a good meal/healthy/fresh food then this is the place to go

Idk id she had a bad day or something but I walked right out and don't really care for it that much. There's plenty of sushi places out there

Worst pilot that ever flew a plane, flew my plane today. Horrible. Sucks at flying. I think it was his first time flying. He showed up late and when he we were landing he had to turn around 2 times cuz he sucks at landing and can't get it right the first time. If you want good quality don't fly with these guys

I came here and ordered burgers with my fiancé and my sister. I was very curious to see what this place Has to offer since it's so close to my house. Once we got our food I went up and asked for sauce for my burger and she gave me two packets. I returned to my seat and we were eating our burgers and halfway as we were finished the employee comes to our table tells us that the sauces are not free that there is a charge for them !!! I can't believe this place had the nerve to come in and interrupt us during our meal for something so minor it's so dumb!!! Either looked at her and said are you serious? I asked are you really going to charge us we were pretty much almost done with their meal? She said yes I have to. I gave her my credit card and she went to charge it. Worst experience I've ever had at a fast food chain with payment. Most ridiculous thing I've ever had to experience. Also the most unprofessional burger chain I've ever ordered from. Will not be coming here due to the unprofessional customer service

That's big breakfast holds the best bacon I've ever ate!! If you order anything from here make sure it has bacon!! I honestly don't know how they do it but I've never ate bacon like I do here. They always have daily specials that I do recommend to go with because their specials or pretty much their signatures. I highly recommend this place for breakfast

Best coffee I've ever drank! They are at the top of the list! Like just in Arizona in the US! I've traveled all over the United States drinking coffee. And I must say I'm a Lola lover! Lol also I make my own coffee at home as well and I buy their beans. Not just that but their prices are fair 4.25$ for a large latte. If you haven't already tried them and love coffee you have to walk into this place at least once

The gelato ice cream's are actually pretty legit. But that custard is something else. It's a good thing to get a good combination of both just so it balances themselves out. There about like anywhere from 3 to 4 dollars it's worth trying if you guys like Ice cream

If you want top quality organic food and this is the place to be. This location just recently opened the last year so it's pretty new for those who don't know what sprouts is. It's right next to my house and I always end up going to buy groceries with my grandma. My grandma is in love with the store so I mostly writing from her part since she doesn't have a Yelp account or a cell phone LOL! She loves this place so much especially when she needs to get her greens all her vegetables and fruits. This place is a little pricey but you get what you pay for. They have every organic drink or fruits or vegetables that you can think of. Also they have rare fruits or vegetables that other grocery stores don't have. So if you're looking for specific rare unique piece of organic food you might want to check this place first before any other places. This store is very clean and has really high maintenance. The employees there are very nice and very knowledgeable also about their fruits vegetables and all their products and produces inside the store. A lot of people use this store and you can see everyone has been giving them a five star so far. So if nobody has complained about this store so far you might as will try it if you can afford it that is. If you're looking to find really good deals it's going to be a rare that you find really cheap deals compared other stores at this place. But at least you're getting top-quality stuff. If you go online you could always look for deals that they have at the sprouts stores. I really hope this review helped you know you have a better picture of what the store is if you've seen it while you were driving by in the neighborhood. Hope you all find what you're looking for and that my review was helpful add me if you want more help for other grocery stores are other restaurants nearby. God bless

Starbucks does not have quality drinks any more.... Every time I order from them they screwed you over with the price and steal shots from your cup. Everything taste really watered-down and I'm not any longer a fan of Starbucks. I'm a big fan of coffee and I recommend any coffee shop around here but Starbucks. Urban been next-door is a Fabulous place to get served with quality coffee

I am in love with chicken sandwiches so I have to say how much I love Chick-fil-A. Chick-fil-A sandwiches are always in my agenda. This Chick-fil-A location is about 2 miles away from my home. Whenever me and my roommates are feeling hungry. We get up we drive to this location. This location is actually one of the cleanest locations and most modern locations in all of Arizona. Their employees also seem very experienced and more in their older ages to where they have manners. When I order I normally just order two Chick-fil-A sandwich with honey mustard just to get the most bang for my buck. All sandwiches on the menu are well-prepared and delicious. Also  there dessert menu is fantastic.  They have a great ice cream sundae with melted fudge on top of it.

So I found them on yelp and they came right over with good timing and man was I impressed when they finish!!!!! You cannot beat their prices and they're great quality of work!!!! If you want five-star service to get a bang out of your buck you better call this guy. He's a young guy with great potential. If you're looking for great carpet cleaning call this guy he won't let you down

I ate here becauseI was craving wings with my wife. We came here all the way from central Phoenix which is 20 which is about 20 minutes to 30 away and ordered 40 wings. The service  was great but we were so disappointed in the wings. We wish we never came here. I feel that because we came in at 8:30 they gave us old wings laying around and microwaved them.The wings were not crispy at all and didn't even taste like chicken but more likemeat balls. My wife was saying that even if they microwaved them it shouldn't have came out that bad. So I gave one star for the food and the other star is for the service. Don't ever come here
