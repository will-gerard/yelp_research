This boutique certainly is well organized and the staff are friendly enough.  For me, it's all about the small details, including the candy at the counter.  I found many items to try on and walked out with a dress I absolutely love.  My friend was bored because she's a larger woman and didn't find any clothes that would fit her.  She noted that most boutiques do not have sizes for ladies who may have extra large cups.

I had a luxurious stay at Bellagio and am in awe of the decor throughout the hotel.  The views from my room were stunning.  It was just a bonus to have watched 'O', being the best Cirque show I've seen, and eaten at the Buffet, which also is the best one I've visited in Vegas.  I'm still shocked at how amazing the pasta was.  The pool cafe was a wonderful place to relax.    One downside is the looooong hallways, making for a time intensive walk to get anywhere near the action if you're staying in a corner suite (which I did).  Another downside is the expense of most things related to this hotel.  I'm not a high roller, so staying here and purchasing anything is a rare treat.  I wish it were more affordable.

I really enjoyed my stay at The Mirage.  I was happy with service from the front desk, room service and servers in the various lounges.  I thought my room was modern, clean and comfortable.  I was happy with the bed and pillows.  I really didn't need to leave the resort.  Between taking in the shops, including what I'd actually consider 5 star shopping in Love Boutique/The Beatles store (as I'm a huge fan), attending the Cirque Du Soleil show Love, visiting Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden and Dophin Habitat, B.B. Kings Blues Club, California Pizza Kitchen, etc., I just didn't need anything else.  I really only left to avoid feeling lazy.  I met lots of cool people (including fellow Albertans) in the lounges and felt completely content here.

My first balloon ride was with Hot Air Expeditions a few days ago so I have nothing to compare this company to, but my bucket list experience was everything I had hoped for.  My friend and I had to meet them two days in a row because our initial flight was cancelled due to high winds.  The second attempt was successful but during set-up, it was discovered that the balloon had a tear, so another rig was brought out for us.  Yeah, we had to wait longer than everyone else and get up at 4am two mornings in a row, but that's the nature of this business and for those who complain about it should take a hard look at the miracle of flight and be grateful that this opportunity is accessible to us in the first place.    The crew we dealt with was pretty friendly, especially considering how early they have to get up and how physically hard they work.  Our Captain was Walter and the Crew Chief was Todd.  Great guys.  My friend felt that Walter was a little dramatic when landing and made her nervous because he thought out loud.  Our landing was more challenging for him because we flew later in the morning, which is not his preference.  As for myself, I was highly entertained by it and thought the whole landing process was a riot.  I will add that it was incident free.  It just took longer than usual because the weather is trickier as the day goes on.    The ride itself is very serene and it's cool to see other balloons around you.  The views are lovely, despite the fact that you're in the desert.  The champagne breakfast at the end wraps things up nicely.  I wasn't expecting them to bring picnic tables out so we could eat where we landed. so that was cool.  The food was high quality and I'm not going to complain about being served mimosas at any time of the day.  My only recommendation would be that the Captain initiate introductions amongst the people sharing a basket, as I think it would make things more comfortable for everyone right from the start.  The basket is cozy so knowing the name of the person invading your space ahead of time would be nice.

My spouse and I came here for the first time two weeks ago during late morning and early afternoon hours.  It was low key and a nice break from the noise and crowds on Las Vegas Blvd.  We spent a few hours here and I'd say we saw a good portion of what this area has to offer.  We used valet parking at Golden Nugget which is close to the pedestrian walkway and hassle free.  There are a few shops to enjoy and no long line-ups to contend with at Starbucks or the restaurants.  There are a few bars you can walk up to without going into the casino.  One situated right outside of the D pours everything but blended drinks, which are strong and a good price.  I would be interested in going back in the evening sometime to see live music and video shows, but I truly didn't feel like I was missing out on anything by being here during the day.

Yes, it's a 2 star establishment but I'd stay here again.  Why?  Our room was clean, inexpensive via Expedia, and is somewhat close to Las Vegas Blvd.     You must remember that because it's a motel, you have no noise buffer.  If you're going to bed at a somewhat reasonable hour and sober, don't be surprised if car noise and hollering wake you up later on.  My spouse and I thought of using the air conditioner as white noise but it actually seemed too loud and annoying, so we avoided it.  Fri and Sat night was a little rowdy, but Sunday evening was fine.  It's really quiet during the day and we figured out that catching up on sleep by napping was helpful.  I didn't fear for my life, so thumbs up.  We had two double beds in the room, not much for floor space, one chair, no desk or mini fridge.  It's manageable for adults but I wouldn't want to stay in such a room with kids.  Maybe the Inn has other options.  Wireless internet was terrible and we didn't bother with it.  The TV is older and securely fastened to the TV stand, so connecting a laptop or adjusting the position was out of the question.  I had my hopes up for a decent pool and hot tub, but they looked a bit neglected so we stayed out.  The water temperature in the shower fluctuated but not once was I frozen or scalded.  Some of the towels were a bit thin and the tub finish is nearly gone but as mentioned, everything was clean and that's all I cared about.  These things were a bit disappointing but in no way did any of it ruin our stay.   The bed was surprisingly solid and the pillows were good.  We were situated above the laundry room and near the ice machine, but somehow it didn't seem to make a difference to us.    If you're picky, just don't stay here.

If nothing else, you must stop by to try the frozen hot chocolate.  It's often a busy place, so the walk-up window is handy.  I've had two meals here and tasted others.  I must say that I nearly died and went to heaven when I tried their mac and cheese.  I could have drank the leftover cheesy goodness from the bottom of the bowl.  The cheese omelet I ate on my first visit was massive and hit the spot, although it was a tad salty.  The yam fries were good.    I enjoy their food presentations and the decor stirs up an Alice In Wonderland feel for me.  I just think it's a novel place to eat and is a nice change from the lounges, pubs and buzz of the strip.

You know, the food was okay overall but my first 15 minutes here was painful.  There was a massive line-up upon walking in the door and no one to take our names and seat us.  After a long period of confusion, we realized that half of the line-up was for people trying to pay their bill.  I had to use Assertive Crystal and get us seated before I pulled my hair out.  Apparently Assertive Crystal scared the befuddled hostess and made a few waiting patrons angry, as I suspect we were seated too early.  Oops.  None of this should have happened.  Clearly the current staff are not cut out for this madness.  I had a very plain breakfast and somehow the toast wasn't good.  They put way too much butter in the center and the crust was a bit too hard and dry.  I didn't think you could screw up toast but it was the first time ever that I wasn't happy with it.  Everything else was acceptable and my spouse enjoyed his omelet.  His glass of orange juice was massive.  I thought the atmosphere and decor was a little weird.  They were prepared to celebrate Easter but it looked like the entire restaurant was decorated by a Kindergarten class.  Maybe it actually was.  We ate here because it was convenient and I'd only go back if that were the case again.

This is a great shop with large dressing rooms and a 3-way mirror, which is really appreciated.  I did find a dress that fit like a glove, so I had to buy it.  I'm not familiar with designers so don't know if I got a deal.  I was told my $75 Michelle Jonas dress is worth $300.  Who really knows.  Either way, I found something I liked.  I might add that my friend is a larger woman and absolutely couldn't find a single piece of clothing that would fit her.  The only shopping options she had here are accessories.
