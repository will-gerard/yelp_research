Great vendors that are affordable are rare. Here's one that must be shared. With R and R Images being acquired by Shutterfly, I needed to find a new printer for a reprint of a small job they had done last year. They recommended AlphaGraphics. Really? was my first thought. Then I called the store. Very nice. Turns out a couple of the AG stores are huge and have tons of capabilities. Larry Furlong is the franchise owner and couldn't be more friendly and accommodating. He emailed over a quote within minutes! And the next day I had a courier deliver a full capabilities kit with samples, catalogs, etc. They cater to agencies, he says. I'll say. They've just taken a spot in my "Supplier Swiss Army knife". Email the file and they'll blind ship to your client and drop a few samples in the mail for you as well. Boom. There you go.

Very clean facilities. Tons of parking even though its nearly full at noon each day. The salad bar is always well stocked and very fresh. Wonderful soups and deserts too. Nice music, modern not elevator. Attentive staff to remove your dirty plates/bowls. Nearly always use their emailed coupons for BOGO (with drink purchase). Pricey but worth it as long as it's not too frequent.

Without question, the best Philly Cheesesteak I've had! The ambiance is still changing/improving since the new owners took over,  but if you're looking for a mean, big guy loving Philly, you've come to the right place. Their homemade thick fries are great too. Just the right amount of sea salt. I got the Steaken combo with CheeseWhiz, mushrooms, peppers, and onions. I was stuffed! The owner asked me to name one thing I would change or that could improve and I couldn't think of anything. I've eaten here before and this was as good as I've gotten. Not sure what the other review is talking about.

3pm Saturday. Came here for the first time after going to Four Peaks Brewery for the first time. Four Peaks would get 5 stars compared to this. Really strange smell. Dumpy dive vibe as soon as you walk in. Good selection of beers on tap. Pretty clean bathrooms. warm glasses for beers. Ice for water came out of a Igloo cooler. Bartenders were nice but seemed amateur. Won't be back.

Only came in to pick up some of their homemade tortillas. One word, meal. I could eat an entire dozen just for dinner. Add a margarita and I'm done. Gotta try those tortillas!

Went Friday around 7:00. 5-10 minute wait. Good hefeweizen. Great Antipasto salad. Pizza was good, the small burnt parts were nice actually. The best was the Fresca desert - a crepe, stuffed with vanilla ice cream and fresh fruit, then topped with more fresh fruit and whipped cream. Wow.

Fish wasn't cooked. Good Guinness. My wife and I stopped in for dinner on Saturday 4-17-10 around 5:00. We sat on the patio and ordered Guinness while we looked at the menu. She got a French Dip and me - Fish & Chips. Easy. The patio was comfortable with the misters but the cushions on the wrought iron chairs had a lot of wear (sweat) on them - pretty gross. The food arrived and looked good. Her sandwich was great; lots of French Dips around are pretty flavorless. My fish was deep-fried and crispy. A really big piece and a very small piece. Started w/ the small which was just okay. Then tearing off a piece of the big portion - it was much juicier than fish should be - at closer look, it was kind of clear looking flesh, not flaky. The waitress was right there and pleaded ignorance since she has never eaten fish. I told here to just get me a French Dip instead. About ten minutes later it showed. No apology from the waitress (although she was nice enough) and no acknowledgement at all from the kitchen or anyone else. If it was my restaurant I would've comped the entire meal - at least the food part.  Wasn't busy so I'm not sure why the kitchen may have been rushed if that was the problem. We won't be back.

Wow. Small place, huge flavor. Friendly, not prissy waiter. Knew the menu inside and out. Made great recommendations. Pizza is as good as the best out there: Bianco, Grazie, etc. good pasta and amazing cannoli. Saw them featured on PBS Check Please! show. So glad we found them!

What a great lunch. Service here was impeccable. Our server, Ariel was very attentive, super polite and such a sincere, friendly smile! It was two of us and we ordered an appetizer, entrees and was sure to stop early so we could have dessert. Ariel even put our leftovers in a container with ice since we were going to a movie afterward. Very nicely done all around. Oh yeah, the food. Wonderful. Flavors that explode. Carefully devised recipes that resulted in truly satisfying mouthfuls bite after bite. Well done. Slow clap. Where's my pillow?

Wife and I went to Luci's this weekend for lunch. I loved the idea after driving by and then checking out the website. I was surprised at a few things. Waiting by the kitchen area to grab a menu, the grill was a freakin mess! We almost left right then. The manager? guy was kind of pestering the chef? to get this next order right. The chef guy seemed very disinterested in listening to him. Kind of weird.   Food order was wrong. They offered to remake it which was fine. Then the order came back out and they were out of chips this time, so I had to choose a different side.   Cramped interior. Had to squeeze between tables to the side of the garage door to some baskets mounted to the wall to get plasticware. Just not what I was expecting. Kind of amateurish feeling.   Won't bother going back.

Slooowwww as hell! No updates on our order while we sat there. After 30 minutes we walked out. Waitress came out after seeing us get into our car and held her hands up as if what's wrong? No apologies, "everybody came in at the same time, you have to wait!"

Good food and coffee. Very expensive. 2 coffees, smoked salmon crepe, club crepe and it was just under $45. Cute place.

I would say better than I expected. It's like Subway in a couple ways. 1. Not super comfortable chairs, and pretty chilly a/c (Phx really overdoes the a/c). 2. Choose your ingredients as you go down the line and they make your pizza in front of you. Then you pay and wait just 5-10 minutes for the pizza. Spartan interior with little graphics and decor. Very friendly staff, I think the owner was one of them. The ingredients looked like good quality. I got the pizza with all of the italian meats. Mmm. Crust is that wonderful combo of crispy outside and chewy inside. So good. Improve the comfort factor inside and another star awaits.

Not even a patient. Yet. That's the problem.   How can one who isn't a patient review an office so poorly. By getting the runaround. Called to get an overview price for a procedure. No can do. Must have a consult first. How much is that? Good question. Can't get an accurate price on that either. Around $250 "or so".  So how much is the average, typical procedure (a common one so you know)?   "Well, a very rough range is $500, total." she says.  Me: Oh, well at least I have a rough ballpark number.   Her: "But that doesn't include anesthesia."   Wait, these don't usually need anesthesia?   "Well that's something you'll discuss in the consult" she says.  "But I don't want to pay for the consult just to learn how much the procedure is going to cost."   "I'm sorry, that's how we do it," she says.  "So how much is the anesthesia generally cost?"  "I don't know. A different company handles that."  When I called my insurance company to ask how much my my policy will cover, guess what they reply. "You'll have to talk to your doctor."  Facepalm.

First time in. Can't comment on the food. Didn't get any. Went at 5pm on Saturday and there was a 45 minute wait. Walked thru to get a drink or maybe wait on the patio. Half the tables had no food. There was a weird vibe. Sort of like at the airport when there has been an hour delay and everyone is glassy-eyed and just staring into space. Music was barely audible. No tv in the bar area. An argument between the bartender and a waitress in front of everyone -- not bad but definitely not friendly (more like "that's YOUR job, that's YOU!" Sort of thing.)   Got a cool premise but lots to work out. We decided to head to another burger place. Good luck. We'll try again later.
