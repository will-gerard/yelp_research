Neat little coffee shop with a bar how could you go wrong? I do wish the bar had a drink menu.

I love this place!!!!! My favorite time to visit is Monday or Tuesday night after 8pm for the $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine.

I am trying to buy a home, distance from La Condesa is a huge deciding factor, that's how good it is. really, its that good.   The quesadilla are not your mamma's quesadilla, by the end of my meal my table is filled with tiny plastic cups from the salsa bar because there are so many to try, and the guacamole is like none I've ever had before.

We went here because a friend chose it for her birthday. We had a large group, 15 I think, and it was a Friday, and they don't take reservations, so it was a poor choice on that friends behalf.  We were quoted an hour and a half wait.  We waited, and waited, and waited.   We were seated about 2 and a half hours later.  While we were waiting a woman who I assume was a manager took our order so that we wouldn't have to wait for the food once seated.  We still waited, apparently she forgot to tell the waitress exactly what was going on and took off.  Appetizers came out with meals, stuff took forever.  And the food, not even worth it.  Our waitress was a gem though, completely got stuck with a screwed up situation that management and the hostesses should have handled better.  She did her best to make up for the crap start to the night.

Tonight I discovered pho king. And you know what? I love pho king! Pho king is like my favorite! My wife likes pho king too!    I could certainly see enjoying pho king with friends, but can also see my self enjoying pho king alone.  Pho king is good for all occasions! I could even see pho king as a nice surprise for a special date. I cannot recommend pho king highly enough.

There's a reason this was voted as one of the best brewery in the us. The food is always fantastic and the rotating beers will always have me wanting to come back.
