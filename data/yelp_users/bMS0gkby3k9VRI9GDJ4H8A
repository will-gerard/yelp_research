Having recently moved into the Tempe area, I found myself at a loss for which restaurants faired the best. Naturally I asked many for their opinions and a slew of places were recommended. However I noticed some of the restaurants were disliked by a few people when I mentioned another's recommendation. Only one establishment seemed to convey great reviews across the board, Four Peaks. Naturally I had to try it.   My first visit, with my parents, was slightly overwhelming. The parking situation is subpar so prepare to walk a bit to your destination. Hardly a bane to my experience though as for the second my family and I were seated, I knew I had gone to the right place. The building itself seems to be the shell of a has-been factory of sorts. The large wide open spaces allow for maximum seating arrangements, which translates into a short waiting time. Servers here tend to be on the up and up when it comes to taking drink orders and providing refills. While I wouldn't call it a five star service, the managers clearly have constructed a solid waiting plan that finds a nice balance between giving regular service and your personal space.    Make no mistake, Four Peaks is a brewery. Through and through. The beer is the number one priority, and boy do they deliver. Being the first timers that we were, the waiter suggested ordering a sample platter of beer so as to try each one and perhaps find a favorite. He was adequately knowledgable about which beers would fit which pallet and within no time at all, we had a row of beer glasses lined up in the middle of the table. All of the beers were good to great. My personal favorite (which seems to be a common choice) is the Kilt Lifter. I highly recommend it and since my initial try have bought six packs of it many times.  A large unfocused menu, to me, typically indicates a restaurant without direction. The lack of said direction often translates into poor food as well. Four Peaks defies my logic as it sports the large menu that dips into various genres of food, but the food actually manages to be incredible.   The nachos. Order them. You will NOT be disappointed. Blackened chicken, loads of fresh cheese, and a bean dip that'd give any top of the line Mexican restaurant a run for their money. How can you go wrong?  Burgers. Burgers. And... more burgers. I consider myself to be somewhat of a beef snob. Medium rare hand pressed party, a toasted and quality bun, and a stack of fresh tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and pickles. Without any single component a burger can quickly find itself tasting like an overpriced late-night Wendy's adventure. Or in other words, nothing to warrant my five star review. Four Peaks thankfully takes their burgers seriously. Cooked to order and taste a plenty, I guarantee you will not find a dissatisfying burger on the menu. My personal favorite is the Popper Burger (I believe that is the name). Try it, you can't go wrong.  Other dishes I have tried over the several visits I've made since my first have been the fish tacos (very tasty), steak sandwich (not my favorite, but still good), and a salad (cannot remember the exact one, but it was phenomenal). As far as I am concerned, there is hardly a thing on the vast and sprawling menu that won't satisfy your hunger cravings. Portions here are absolutely massive as well. Bring an empty stomach!  Pricing manages to be fairly reasonable for an environment and food/drink service as high caliber as it is. Four Peaks is THE place to go in Tempe.   Just don't forget the nachos.

Oh La Bocca... Since my discovery of this place over a year ago I have visited a solid  dozen times. Why? Because it simply excels in almost every category.   The wait times have never been lengthy for me, granted I usually try to avoid dinner rushes unless I'm equipped with a reservation. Service tends to be on the quick side. Well organized and knowledgable, the staff here will guide you well into your first meal experience with ease. Extensive wine lists covering various regions and styles will entice you to indulge a bit into a drink or two. Be careful though as the wine can quickly rack up your bill!   The decor is incredibly well done. Beautiful paintings and alluring photographs have been meticulously placed with astoundingly careful consideration. The furniture gives an oddly successful blend of casual elegance which translates itself into a nearly unmatched ambiance. Old classic movies are often projected onto a wall near the bar, something intriguing to me as I have never seen such a thing in a restaurant before. Thankfully the sound is muted on the movie and purposes itself only as an intelligent use of visual oddity. Great touch. For looks alone you cannot find much better in the Tempe area.   Appetizers here are very well done. The Bruschetta is an absolute MUST! Do not leave here without getting your table at least one platter of the delicacies. Oh my are they good...   Pizzas here are made in your standard artisan style. The Sicilian is the best, but maybe I only think so because of my natural gravitation to anything goat cheese. You can't really go wrong with the pizza, it's a solid artisan pie with typically great flavors and cooked to perfection. Only one time has La Bocca let me down, and the manager was quick to fix the issues with the food. Hardly a bad experience really.  Being the calzone fiend that I am, it was only a matter of time before I tried one. Usually a hit or miss at most restaurants, I can only thank the food gods for teaching whoever the chefs are how to make a great calzone. Luckily it's in a build your style as well so you pickier eaters can be satisfied too! Highly recommended and my favorite thing on the menu next to the bruschetta.  Bills can get up there in price. Be prepared to spend around $15-25 a person depending on drinks.   If the recently trendy wine/bruschetta bar is your thing try La Bocca. In my opinion it trumps Postino's in almost every category, a great feat as Postino's is certainly no easy competition.

Doesn't even deserve a long review as i usually give.   Extremely overpriced for the quality of food you're getting. Over salted. Undercooked. No. Just no. We ordered the jambalaya and two burgers. All were terribly mediocre.   The service is a joke as well. It took 15 minutes to get water, another 15 to take our order, and 45 minutes to receive our food. Absolutely disgraceful.   This place has a great name but has a terrible attitude. I guess the name arrogant really fits! Will NOT be returning and will be spreading the word about how bad it is here for the price.

A word of advice to those eating in the Tempe area: avoid restaurants filled with trendy vibes, trendy college students, and 40-somethings dressing 20-something to relive their trendy years. Do I sound petty? Perhaps. But I stand by that statement and Ncounter is probably the best proof I can display to fulfill my words.  Aesthetically, Ncounter appears to be your standard wannabee "coffee center of intellect." Sepia toned pictures of windmills straight out of the Wizard of Oz, run-of-the-mill bright wood tables, a "bar," and a hand full of the self-proclaimed elite trend monkeys I just love so much to hate. What a bore.   Now being my first, and hopefully last, visit to Ncounter both myself and the person I came with were slightly taken back by the new menu. Standing a few feet away from the actual ordering area we spent at least five or so minutes pondering upon what to eat. Everything sounded so appealing and utterly delicious! Every breakfast classic from eggs benedict (shortened to "bene's" ugh...) to your standard omelette had enough variations available to please nearly any palette. Already in the mood for an omelette, I gravitated towards an item entitled the "Hot Juan." Chorizo, salsa, jalapenos, cheese, peppers, and onions; sounds wonderful does it not? My breakfast mate decided upon a somewhat similar option, "Huevos n' Chorizo." Essentially the same dish only the eggs are served sunny side rather than in omelette form. We also ordered a side of sourdough toast and a coffee to share. **The coffee here is self serve, something I have not before seen in a restaurant. A great idea I wish more establishments would catch on to.**  Before I get into the actual food itself I want to discuss the vibe and service of Ncounter. The place is infested with what could possibly be the rudest, most self-absorbed, trendy, soul wretched, basic, and nasty clientele and staff on Earth. Everyone from the man behind the ordering counter to the bus boys to the gathering of Pitchfork Media fans (some of them were actually wearing the logo on their clothes...) exuded a vile aura of judgement. Sneering and sneakily nodding at the apparently entertaining crowd around them, each and every individual resembled a cartoon character created to fill the world with angst and elitism. I could not help but feel like an onlooker of a real life Breakfast Club. Clashing cliques of staff and customers. Is this a restaurant or high school? Also really did not appreciate my server essentially tossing my plate of food on the table and scurrying away without a word.   Okay so you get the point, the place is hipster hell. Or maybe I'm just being dramatic. I imagine everyone will have different opinion on the matter. Fortunately, I actually do have something both undeniable AND negative to spew about Ncounter. The food resembled that of a musty and fly ridden diner I once ate at in a nightmare I had years ago. In fact, it was so insultingly putrid and revolting I refuse to actually go in depth. So instead here is a short list of single words that describe the slop I was served: 1. Cold 2. Meatless 3. Pace (yes, like the salsa brand) 4. Floppy 5. Speechless   Ncounter serves no purpose for a foodie, which is weird because I seem to have developed a love-hate relationship with the dump over the course of writing this review. I absolutely LOVE and ADORE the fact that Ncounter is essentially the restaurant equivalent to an Old-Western brothel. The over-hyped food and foul attitude of the place keeps trendy people out of my sight much like cheap whiskey and prostitutes herded the mongrel masses of times past into a playpen of their own filthy ways. I absolutely HATE everything else about it.   In case you didn't pick this up on your own, the ever increasing anger in the tone of my review really just represents EXACTLY how my experience played out... Also I feel ashamed I actually devoted so much emotion and time into writing about Ncounter. God, even the name is terrible isn't?

Only been one time, but it's safe to say I had an above average experience! I ordered the half pound Jalapeño Jack burger with a side of onion rings. The burger entailed a perfect spice, high quality meat (from Midwestern meats), and flavorful cheese. The onion rings were really great too! Decent portions here, I was definitely full.  My only problem is that my bill was $11 and change. A bit pricey for a no frills in and out styled place that caters to those who need a quick bite to eat after work or another event. I didn't even order a drink, mind you. Regardless it's but a minor set back in what was a really solid burger! I'd recommend it to others.

Really not seeing the draw to this place. Visited yesterday on a recommendation from one of their staff members I met who seemed to have nothing but wonderful things to say about his employer's restaurant. Needless to say his opinion failed to meet my expectations.   First impressions are not everything. Make no mistake, the building itself is impeccably decorated. Inside and out are both done up really well. The place was absolutely jam packed with people too. At least 150 people were crammed into the premises, all seemingly enjoying the rush of the fast paced ordering service. And it's here that I have to hand it to them. With lines nearly out the door (and it's a long way from the registers to the exit), employees handled the crowd with ease. No hiccups. No rudeness. Perfect service. At this point it's safe to say I was impressed and excited to eat!   Unfortunately you just cannot rely on first impressions. The decor is a facade for what really is going on here. Only one word comes to mind when I now think of Portillo's: GIMMICK. The food here is nothing to write home about at all, or maybe it is, just not in the way you might think. The hot dogs I ordered were served in your typical Chicago style. Sesame seed bun, pickle, hot peppers, tomatoes, onions, and mustard. How could you go wrong? Right? Well they managed to... The bun was straight out of a cheap grocery brand bag. The hotdog tasted like an undercooked Bar S hotdog glazed with the dirty dollar bills Dick Portillo managed to swindle out of me. I could have easily made this at home for a fraction of the price and effort. Even the onion rings were from a low grade frozen grocery store brand. I know this because I often buy the exact same ones to eat at home, they are indistinguishable in both looks and taste. Terribly mediocre and good only for a quick frozen home meal.   Some people will gawk at my review and say "Try the Italian beef. You'll change your mind." And to that I say "My friend ordered the 'Italian' beef and cheese croissant with gravy. I took one bite and found myself only pushed further to disgust by this rip off of an establishment."   What a waste of time and money. I think it's safe to say Portillo's failed to gain a regular customer yesterday. I also think it's safe to say I won't be recommending this pace to anyone any time soon.   The only thing saving it from receiving a one star review is it's visual appeal and perfectly managed staff. So... kudos to you Dick Portillo for creating one of the largest privately owned food brands around! What a business plan you've crafted here too! Incredibly cheap ingredients and components sold at a premium... Wow... Can you say profits?! I'd love to own the place for a week. A privately owned chain with an owner who's story defines the "American Dream" and basing out of a city famous for this style of food... Sounds good on paper but ,take heed, only one word can describe Portillo's: gimmick.

Fourth time coming here in a month and each time has been excellent. Service is great and relatively quick (although I wouldn't recommend coming in if you're in a rush).   So far I've had the Caprese and Italian Chicken sandwiches. Both are great and utilize very fresh ingredients.   The breakfast sandwiches are pretty good, too.   Their iced coffee is run-of-the-mill but it gets the job done.   Atmosphere inside is perfect for lounging and getting some work done if need be.   Couldn't recommend this place enough! Especially if you're local!
