Made arrangements to meet with Joseph regarding replacing my wooden fence with block after a storm finally beat it into submission. He came to my home and was patient enough to listen to all my landscaping ideas and put together the most competitive bid around. Joseph has been prompt in communications and all-around easy to work with. I'm really looking forward to working with Falcon Landscaping and updating here on the fabulous work completed on my yards.

We popped in while we were Downtown for an event. After figuring out the system and ordering and paying, one of two burgers arrived. 15 minutes later we inquired after our missing food. 30 minutes later, still no burger and plenty of folks stopped by, seemingly puzzled about the whereabouts of the burger. We were assured that they were bringing out a burger immediately, it was going to be priority -- the next burger that arrived would be ours. 45 minutes after the order was placed and after watching several other burgers walk out of the kitchen, we had still not received any morsel of our second order of food. We gave up and asked for a refund. Probably 10 minutes later we finally packed up to clear out, and were approached by the female bartender, who had promised our burger would be out next, who now seemed irritated and inconvenienced that we had requested a refund. No one apologized. We got explanations, but no "I'm sorry". And never any food. We were baffled at the terrible service and the unapologetic attitude. Kitchen screw-ups are understandable, but the way frontline servers handle it is key. This was a disappointing disaster.
