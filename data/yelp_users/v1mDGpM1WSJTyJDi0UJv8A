Great little barber shop, I've been to the flashy flat screen on every chair type of place but found I keep coming back to Beasley's. The  classic barber shop chairs and straight razor shaves remind you of what a barber shop should be.

This location is always busy, usually order food to go. Always get teriyaki Tofu and it is hit or miss depending on the cooks that night.   Customer service is the same way, some days your order is ready on time and correct and other days you wait 20 minutes past the pick up time for your food which turns out to be wrong anyways.   Order from them less often than I would like to due to issues, Quick take out runs that turn into an hour long ordeal are never fun.

Love the potato tacos, they don't come with the sauce they came with at the original Matta's on Main St but it's better than loosing them all together. Salsa is good and food is good. I miss the Main Street location but this place is great for take out.
