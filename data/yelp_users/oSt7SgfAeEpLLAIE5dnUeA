I was in the market for a new stylist since mine fled the Phoenix scene in search of cooler weather in Colorado. I went to my Aveda store to pick up some products and there was a stylist from Perry Monge, Marie Luce ( sp?) gave me a coupon for 20.00 off so I decided to give it a try. OMG. From the moment I walked in I felt like royalty. I think I was getting the first time service but not only did I get one of the best haircuts, a styling, a 5 minute back massage, a very thorough hand massage, a facial ( yep),eyebrow waxing, a make-up refresher and an iced cappuccino.  I wound up buying 3 products but I always buy something Aveda when I go so it wasn't a hard sell. I love my new look-my skin looks amazing and the total cost was 122.00 What?! I had a 20.00 off coupon but still.... It was brilliant marketing. I have found a new stylist and I will be faithful in getting a facial each time I go because it's so worth it.  I highly recommend Marie Luce, she is amazing!

Pane Bianco has long been a fav of mine for lunch. What's not to love about fresh baked bread, great ingredients prepared in the typical Italian way-simple, fresh, uncluttered. We were excited to try the newly expanded dine in Pane Bianco and were quite frankly disappointed.  First off, the interior and ambiance are great-no problems there. But, it was only 7pm and they were out of 3 of their dishes-so we went with a pizza-3 cheese and arugula and a special-pasta fagioli-a very popular peasant fare that when made well is sublime. The pizza was okay- a little dry, actually, and I have to admit the pasta was also just okay. I expected a slightly tomato broth with lots of garlic and firm beans with small pasta-more like a soup-what I got was a bland plate of rigatoni with mashed beans. No parmesan even to round out the dish. I think Pane Bianco has some growing pains before it reaches a stellar status and I am confident it will. I suspect it was just an off night.

This is my neighborhood "go to" place, so I'm generally there at least once a week . I Stopped in to grab a loaf of bread and WOW! The bake shop has had a make-over! I was happy to see MJB take over from Tammy Coe but this approaching holiday season they are really kicking it up a notch.  New cookies, bars, cupcakes-lemon bars that are gluten free. I can't wait to find an excuse to indulge!

I used to love this place but I suspect it has changed owners in the past few years. we had a friend in town who fondly remembered a meal he once had there so we decided to try it again.. It was a pretty bad experience with bad service-they were unprepared for a busy Friday night. What a disaster! The food is ok ( too salty) but the presentation, lack of care is evident both in service and overall experience. Someone at Thai Lahna needs to regroup and reorganize. I hope they get their act together because it is a great location and has been good in the past.

I've been going here for years but have noticed in the past year or so a decline in the overall quality of the food and the service. The menu has stayed the same but the food just doesn't have the same attention t detail. Our last visit was over the top disappointing-I ordered the crab mango salad which comes plated in a high mold. I tasted it before I broke open the mold an it tasted weird so I broke it open and a fowl smell hit our party's noses that clearly indicated that the crab had gone south. We asked the waiter to take it away and he came back to show us the can it came in? Okay. I know that can happen but if it does, the manager or owner should have come and something extra done, don't you think? It was taken off the bill. period. I had some of my husband's entree because I didn't want to slow down the rest of the meal. My brother ordered a chicken dish and got enchiladas instead, by the time he had several bites and realized it-we were over it- What happened Los Sombreros?

I have been a great fan of the LGO since the very beginning-living just down the street. In fact, The whole LGO Phenomenon has made living in our hood a whole lot more interesting. I would say we are pretty much regulars both at the grocery and pizzeria.  I think I have probably tried everything on the pizzeria menu at one time or another with my favorites being the chicken wings, the orange fennel and spinach salad and of course the pizza. (Still prefer the fish sandwich the old way...) In the past year (or so) we had noticed a slight decline in the usually great vibe in the pizzeria. The food was lacking a bit of soul and the place just seemed to be getting tired. We went back last week and I noticed a difference right away. The place was mobbed-no big surprise-it was Saturday night-so we put our name in and proceeded to stand in our usual corner to wait it out. No more then 10 minutes went by and the manager apologized for the wait and offered us Sangria. Okay! What's not to like about that? 5 minutes later a server was offering us a slice of cheese pizza. Now, was that necessary? No. We would have waited patiently and people watched.  But was it classy, friendly, and neighborly? Yes! Do they need to do that every time-No. We consider this our neighborhood place and to feel welcomed like that was so nice. The service is usually great at LGO-casual but efficient-the way we like it. Personally, at a place like LGO, I don't care what servers are wearing-I really don't even notice-What I do care about is genuine hospitality. Cara, our server, brings that in spades. The food has its soul back and I love the new gelato look and the expanded dessert menu. I am so thankful LGO has stepped it up, (I suspect with a new manager) and a little reinvention. Maybe we'll see a new salad popping up in the near future?

What more needs to be said-with bookstores vanishing from the area in record numbers-Changing Hands has had the fortitude and creativity to keep their doors open. I've loved this bookstore since the 70's and only hope that people will continue to prefer touching and actually seeing a book in real time....

I have been to St Francis several times and really love it but I had one dish that simply blew me away. The forbidden rice bowl-wow-flavors just explode in your mouth. I had chicken added for protein-the dish came to the table so fresh-with perfectly cooked veggies in season, the rice was beyond tasty and the shredded chicken the perfect compliment. The real star is the sauce-delicate,aromatic, light. I ate most of it for lunch then took home the leftover and and had a light dinner. I never eat the same thing twice in a day but this is the type f dish I could eat weekly. Thinking about going back soon...

I love this place for lunch and  brunch on Sunday. The food and vibe is perfection. Only complaint is the live music --not conducive to conversation. In the cooler months you can sit outdoors to avoid the music.

It's a shame this place still operates on the original owners. I've tried this place twice. The food is just not good. Benedicts ordered- english muffin was not toasted -- eggs were overcooked-hollandaise was tasteless. Home fries -- a platter of under-cooked amidst over cooked with no real seasoning. Server was nice but food came out cold and later than normal.  We really wanted to like this place as it's on out bike route. Oh well- back to the drawing board.

I have always loved this market but lately it is a zoo- which is good for the vendors, no doubt. If you don't want to deal with crowds try to get there before 10am. I love Blue Sky and McClendons for produce, there's a rancher who sells goat meat that is truly to die for. Gina's buratta is great but her attendance is sporadic. McClendon's is the most consistent and has the most varieties of produce as he does broker with other farmers in the country. Mushrooms from Oregon and fresh tumeric from Hawaii-it's worth the high price tag. He is also featuring Noble bread. The best bread ever. You can avoid the crowds if you are only getting fresh produce and bread by going to the Wednesday Farmer's Market at Town & Country Plaza. MCclendon is there too.

Yeah, so the decor in this Moroccan themed spa is a bit "Disneyland" but the experience is authentic. The facility has everything you need for a deeply relaxing experience. Dimly lit rest area with comfy couches are great but a whisper area with curtained twin beds are just incredible. The spa pool-on the roof top-overlooks Camelback mountain. It's small and intimate with great food and drinks. Granted we were there on a Monday so it was pretty quiet ( highly recommended!)  The spa area-the whirlpool, cool deluge ( LOVE IT) and the wet and dry saunas are top rate.   The best part of my experience was the massage. Colleen was magical. I love the spiritual-mind-body connection with massage but usually don't expect it at a resort spa. Colleen was tuned in but also extremely competent with the physical aspects of massage. Next time I'm booking with her and it will be the 1.5 hours! I floated through the rest of the day. I would recommend a massage early and then use the early day to relax by the pool and eat. Then do your spa rituals and don't forget the cold water plunge-it is soo worth the initial fear. Then....take a nap! The only negative was the front desk staff( both on the phone and in person) need to step it up in the customer service arena-you expect really over the top interpersonal skills at a high end spa.  We went on the spa week special-79.00-such a deal!

I tend to get into ruts with restaurants and LGO has been my "go to" spot for all meals for some time so I was happy to remember I wanted to try this little gem the other day when my friend and I wanted to get breakfast. We waltzed right in on a Saturday mid morning and scored a table ( there  aren't more than a 1/2 dozen tables) in this tiny establishment.  The place is friendly, warm and you begin salivating the moment you get a glimpse of the pastries and the salad case offerings. We did breakfast but I will be back soon for lunch. I had the perfect"green eggs and ham" two perfect poached eggs on top of a buttermilk toast with arugula and proscuitto with some sort of delicate pesto. I savored every bite. My friend had the waffles-a lemon poppyseed with a blueberry compote. I didn't try but it looked amazing and by the ay she scarfed it down-it must have been. I love that the place uses locally grown/produced food-you can taste &see the freshness. The young ladies sitting next to us were raving about the Kale salad and it looked amazing-they even started a blog called "kale is my crack" we wound up swapping kale recipes with the entire room. There hours all limited-closed mon & sun-tues-fri-8am-3pm sat-8am-1pm

I am blown away by the level of mastery of the instructors, the variety of classes and variety of 2 locations. Every class I have taken has been unique to the instructor. There's loads of different classes to choose from. I have dabbled with yoga for many years but Metta makes me want to dedicate some serious time to getting better versed with it.

I've been a fan for many years but the last few times I have to say, the service is lackluster, to say the least. The food is great and a good value- so I suppose one can't complain. However, it makes you wonder how much better the dining experience would be with a well managed staff. Maybe just avoid the place on the weekends....

I really like this resale shop. You can find very expensive-new to almost new designer wear at very reasonable prices. I got the most amazing Dior red heels-looked like they were worn no more than once or twice for 90.00 dollars. ( The owner gave me 10% off and I had some store credit so they were only 60.00!) The nice thing is they also have brands like Banana Republic so they aren't pretentious.

Okay, so I only had a cappuccino but it was the most divine cap I have had in AZ...ever. Forget they only take cash and may be coffee snobs- The decor is great and I can't wait to try more of their offerings and sit at one of their uber cool computer stations.

First off, a complaint but it gets better.... Me and my husband made reservations on a Saturday evening for 7:15pm. At 7:45 we were still waiting ( along with another couple in the same boat) The bar was full so we awkwardly stood around until finally a manager offered to buy us a cocktail and apologized. Okay, good move ( should have been done 15 minutes earlier) and we enjoyed our cocktails until 45 minutes later we were seated. Hungry as bears, we devoured the yummy herby bacon bread-soft and warm perfect to soak up that cocktail that was going right to my head, We ordered three dishes and one side and shared it all. It was paced beautifully and we felt very cared for by our excellent waiter The ahi tuna tartare appetizer was beautifully presented and delicious. Fresh, clean mild but flavorful. Plenty for two. The next dish was the warm lobster salad-they split it nicely so we each had our own, which is a good thing for my husband because I eat faster than him! This was the stand out plate for me-perfectly cooked lobster, corm, endive and well, I'm not sure what else but each bite was a ticket to heaven. Next came the entree-again split. The boneless short ribs with horseradish gnocchi. The meat was tender but not fall apart-you could cut it with a fork but it retained its shape. Flavored with a slightly sweet sauce-each bit accompanied with a delicate horseradish gnocchi-perfect. We also got the cheesy potatoes with an egg over the top. There were so many potatoes we boxed them and had them for breakfast the following morning. They were a great compliment to the short ribs. It was a cold rainy night and the food was comfort food all the way. We finished with the key lime pie. A small dome of citrusy lightness with a dollop of vanilla ice cream-a perfect finish. We sat very comfortably in a booth right near the kitchen but we weren't bothered at all. The noise level was actually low for such a busy night. The decor is wonderfully appointed-unique-almost post modern baroque. The bathrooms are amazing. All in all-we like it a lot. We will probably stay clear of the place on a Saturday night ( if you want to be seated on time).

A total dining experience! I went with my daughter and we sat at the counter where you can see in full view the entire kitchen at work.  We started with the "Spritz" cocktail, aperol, sparkling wine, an Italian summer standard as we munchec on crostini with the creamiest ricotta and a plate full of heavenly prepared pickled beets. The fired green tomato salad was good as was the sauteed broccoli, We had the halibut as well-everything as fresh as possible,simply prepared, perfectly flavored and you feel as if you have eaten healthy. We had two desserts-the lavender creme brulee and the lemon cake-both excellent. The atmosphere is causal but chic. The wait staff personable but not cloyingly so. I loved this place!

I love this place. The food was sublime as always. This past dining experience I felt a bit rushed - dishes coming out way too fast and I felt like the server was not as attentive as I have had in the past. That bring said- the good more than makes up for it. I think they were just overwhelmed- it was packed Oma Wednesday night. We had the lamb tenderloin - it was the best lamb I have ever tasted. What the chef does with veggies is beyond comparison. Complex- but down to earth.

I really love this coffee house. I actually visited it twice today-once for a meeting and later just to hang out. They have -great coffee ( real macchiatos, and proper cappucinos), great treats and quiet enough to get work done if you need. Only complaint is the music-yes, I'm happy they don't blast rock-there's a time and a place for loud music but the generic soft rock they were playing this afternoon lead us outside to escape-I suggest they do a bit of research, or ask a hipster barrista or customer to give them a play list of acceptable soft-quiet music-I'm thinking Andrew Bird, Iron and Wine, Nick Drake, etc. if you want to keep the mellow mood, don't resort to the piped in muzak version.

I am always excited when a new restaurant comes to my hood. I wanted to like Vatra so much I actually went twice in one week-lunch and dinner to give it a chance. Actually lunch was pretty good.They start you with a great bread basket with whipped butter with paprika and garlic. The decor is really nice but almost too much for the casual vibe of the menu. I had a pizza with arugula and proscuitto and it was decent.My partner had a chicken sandwich that was decent but not memorable. We also ordered a grilled ( chared romaine) caesar-which was not good-at all. Kind of stingy on the parmesan and croutons and with a creamy dressing that had no hint of garlic or anchovy..then don't call it a caesar. When we went back for dinner I had the 5.00 glass of wine which was great and we ordered the Brie appetizer, what's not to like about warm Brie but it was topped with an apple chutney-not enough flavor or amount to really blow me away. On to the jicama salad which was a disaster. Truly, one of the strangest salads I have ever had. The salad came in large bowls brimming with chunky strips of jicama with an almost non-existent dressing. It had a few bites of cucumber and very little roasted corn-so essentially a bowl full of jicama which can get mighty boring after a few bites. The best thing on the salad were candied spicy dried mango but even those little gems couldn't save this salad. We also shared a steak with chimichurri sauce-which was a very good sauce but not enough of it to really get the full on flavor, it came with a few and I mean few roasted vegies. The server was okay-you could tell he was new. This place needs to put its A game together to succeed. Arcadia has a lot of good eating and right now this place is not even in the top 10. Underwhelming is the only adjective I can think of.

I am very excited about the addition of this new restaurant in " my hood"-lower Arcadia. I am such a lazy person when it comes to traveling far for a good meal so when I heard about Beckett's Table I was anxious to give it a try. No disappointment here! The place is heaven. Lovely warm atmosphere-urban without the pretense. The service casual but efficient. And the food....the perfect combination of comfort and elegance. We had the outrageous biscuits to start with our lovely cocktails, the lobster enchiladas-(delicious taste but I missed the lobster..) and the perfectly prepared salmon. Too  full to try the pecan pie-had the creme brulee-which was creamy goodness but would have liked an accompanying fruit or something with it. The menu had so many things I wanted to try-I will be back again and again. Prices are reasonable-2 drinks, biscuits, one appetizer,one entree, 2 desserts all for less than 70.00.

So, yes, this lower Arcadia Thai restaurant is still working out a few glitches but I am confident that they can pull it off with a bit of finesse. First off, the food. It's really good. Fresh, modern and delicious. The last time we went we had lettuce wraps ( the best I've had anywhere) and Thai Beef with Thai Basil/ They split it beautifully for us-enough for 2. I haven't had a bad dish yet. The converted Wendy's is a bit off from the outside but don't let that stop you. It's really cute inside-warm and modern. Problem is they either have the air on too cold, the music too loud and/or the lights turned way too low. All fixable things. The servers are still figuring things out, considering the 3 times we've been there it has been pretty dead. If you like modern Thai food and your tired of Thai Lana...please check this place out-you won't be sorry.

My husband and I get in a rut and tend to stay with the 4-5restaurants we like so I decided to finally try CPH after hearing so much about it. First, I love the vibe there. The open, bistro feel with a lively bar crowd-the noise level is high but not annoyingly so. We had cocktails, which they are famous for-not too sweet and complex. We decided to try 4 appetizers-the stand outs were definitely the pastrami pork belly and the chopped salad. Service is efficient and casual, just the way I like it. I can't wait to come back and try the lamb burger and some of the entrees.

My first time here, we showed up with a group of 12 people on a Saturday night and almost got laughed out of the place but all with a great sense of humor. They set up a place for us outside, which was mighty kind of them, and we had a wonderful evening. I hate to give a review based on one evening and I definitely plan to come back soon and really experience the place. From a "first look" perspective-the food is fresh and interesting-loved the complimentary smoky salsa-I had bites of several kinds of tacos and enjoyed all of them. The Blood Orange Margarita is tasty but like others have commented-it's a wee bit of drink for the price.  I get the concept and I love it-fabulous ambience-fresh ingredients-unusual flavor profiles, clearly not Rubios-this is a destination place. But, that being said, Arizonians are used to great Mexican that doesn't bust the wallet.  I'll be back for a second look!

This is the new place to go for happy hour! The mixologist knows what he is doing and the chef is really creating some lovely food. The happy hour is pretty special-there's a number of small plates priced from $4-6.00 and several dollars off of some great cocktails and wine. We had the roasted peppers ( WOW) , the ricotta salata and the tortilla( Spanish style).  The tempura white anchovies were fabulous. Later we stayed for dinner and had the octopus salad and arugula and berries salad. Each dish was prepared with the highest quality ingredients. We had a vegetarian in the group and they prepared a beautiful pasta for her since there's not a lot of vegetarian options for entrees. It's a small intimate place inside the Bespoke Inn-which I definitely want to check into-it looks very special. I'm looking forward to going back!

Seriously, this is my favorite place to eat right now. Everything I have ordered is absolute perfection. My current favorites are the Farmer's Daughter burger --topped with homemade sauerkraut -- yum. I also love the kale salad, one of the best in the city. They have the best cocktail too-The Greyhound, made with a french grapefruit liqueur. It's casual, friendly and you can almost always get a table immediately. The people at LGO Hospitality know how to create a great restauramt.

Seriously, the best bread out there in the Phoenix area. I buy a loaf each week at either the Town & Country farmer's market ( at the McClendon's Farm booth-another great purveyor of excellent food) or at the Scottsdale Market on Saturday. This bread can be toasted all week long-you won't find a tastier, toothier, complex, bread. From what I hear they use there own method of rising ( non commercial yeast) and heirloom grains. Some people have commented that they can eat this bread if they are gluten sensitive.

The Coronado is sooo good! I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but it doesn't matter. You won't miss the meat! The potato tacos and goat cheese quesadilla-yum! Also, leave room for the pastries...do not miss the chocolate brownie with chili and orange. It is quite extraordinary. The people behind the place are super cool and the servers and baristas -top notch. The cafe is inside a great house and still has that homey-chill out vibe. Highly recommended!
