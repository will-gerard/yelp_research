I've been to like 2 Vietnamese restaurants in my life, so I'm not an expert and can't compare this to anything else.  But I really liked the food and the flavors of this food.  I could see the menu being a little overwhelming but I asked some people who'd been before and checked the other Yelp reviews and decided on the following:  Beef Chow Fun - Yum.  Greasy but excellent dish.  Kind of reminded me of Mongolian beef over noodles.   Fun indeed.  Spicy Beef w/ Rice Noodles - Probably my favorite of the soups I tried.  This had a little bit more going on that just broth and noodles.  Good enough that at some point, I will crave a bowl and be back for it.  Freshly Sliced Beef Pho - This was what I expected.  A kind of nicely flavored beef broth soup.  A little bland for me, but my kids LOVED it.  Pork Bun (pork and egg rolls on cold vermicelli noodles) - I was most surprised by this one.  Cold noodles and fish sauce makes me say "meh," but I really liked this dish.  Fish sauce and all.  Actually the sauce probably made the dish.  As everyone else has said, the places is pretty cheap.  Unlike everyone else... you can keep the darn spring rolls.  Egg roll... awesome.  Cold transparently wrapped bunches of tasteless lettuce... not so much.

What's OK:  I don't go to places like this for lasagna, pasta, or your typical generic Italian dishes.  They are usually a waste of an order 90% of the time anyway, and Floridino's is no different.  Those dishes are just fine.  The pizza is... OK.  Sandwiches... not bad.  The good here is value.  The prices are what they should be when you go out somewhere and order a plate of spaghetti.  But you aren't going to order that anyway, right?  What you need to get is an antipasto salad, some pizza muffins, and absolutely a calzone.  I'm not coming here without getting a calzone, they are great.  Combine that with the reasonable prices and locally-owned, family friendly atmosphere and I'm a fan.

Just stopped by here for dinner the other day and figured I'd write a review.  I've been here twice and have had a good experience both times.  Their food is very tasty.  When I went for lunch I thought their selection wasn't as big as other places, but everything was well prepared.  Out of both, I prefered dinner even though we were the only people in the place.  The food came out pretty quick and was super fresh.  The meat samosa, garlic naan, chicken biriyani, chicken curry, and tikki masala were all great.  I think even though everyone seems to love the tikki masala I liked the curry better.  ALSO to note, it was very spicy, more than when prepared for the buffet I think, which I thought was great.

I love the food at all of Los Dos Molinos restaurants. It is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the WORLD.   I have never had a bad meal here.  Also, their food is excellent.  HOT but excellent.  Their salsa is hot and delicious and margaritas are pretty great too.  I usually stick with the enchilada plate most of the time.  Although the ribs and chili beans are excellent too if you can take the heat.  Also the place is run by the family and you can usually find one of them any given day at the restaurant eager to please.

This place was a winner.  I don't eat around Tempe too often and when I do I'd like that experience to be unique.  I was looking for a place to grab some good food and a couple beers before a concert so I checked out Yelp and it did not lead me astray.  To me, a place like this is why Yelp needs to exist.  It was not in the most obvious location and when the group I was with went to walk in the front door we almost didn't know we were in the right place.  Let's just say their limited space is used very efficiently.  For what this place lacks in size, it makes up in character.  Inside it was kind of dark with some chairs lining the bar long the open kitchen and on the other wall a few small tables.  We found our spot in the back which was probably the only table big enough for 6 people.  The place was full and the noise level was just right; busy, but comfortable to have some lively dinner conversation. (Especially after some Irish Car Bombs.)  Their draft beer selection stuck to the UK theme with a lot of beers from that region.  I was especially surprised to see some Strongbow Cider.  They also had a few good micro brews from places like Firestone and Rogue.  Between that selection and the 32 oz. monster glasses they'd serve it in, this place was already a winner.  Most importantly, their food was excellent.  I had the TIki Masala pasty and my wife had the Chicken Greek.  The Tiki Masala would be a great dish served by itself in an Indian restaurant.  Put it in a pasty and it's game over.  I tasted my wife's Chicken Greek which I probably wouldn't have picked as one of my own top choices to order and it was awesome.  We unanimously agreed this place was great and we had a laugh about some review around here that compared it to a Hot Pocket.  LOL.  I'll have to save that one under, "Knowing about good food - FAIL!"

Some of these reviews kill me.  People go to a wing place and order chicken strips, or get some random sauce they didn't like and blame the restaurant.     Now for what to expect:  I never have/will order anything but a chicken wing from this place and I'd recommend you don't go here unless you want a chicken wing.  Also, it is more setup for a smaller lunch/dinner crowd and I imagine they get most of their business from take out orders.  Lastly, they cook the wings to order which take 15 minutes to prepare.  'Nuff said.  Now I have 3 reasons I love this place.  First, their wings are cooked to perfection.  They are juicy and cooked just enough to have that perfect crispness one should except from a chicken wing.  I've never had them screw it up the many times I've been there.  Second, their fries are delicious.  They remind me of boardwalk fries which you don't get around here much and they put what I think is a salt/sugar seasoning on them which is excellent.  Last but not least is their sauces.  While oddly bright red their regular hot flavor is well done.  The garlic parm is simple and delicious.  And my favorite and the most unique is lemon pepper.  It is oddly tangy and I can't figure out how they do it.  They aren't cheap but I think you get your money's worth.

I liked this place.  Probably best during the less hot months as most of the seating is outside.  Inside the house is a bit cramped, but the history makes it worthwhile.  The food was good.  I had the corned beef hash which was very good.  The pancakes were pretty good too and everyone at our table enjoyed their food.  Albeit there was nothing on the menu that I'm going to be like, "I HAVE to go back and have that again," everything was well prepared and tasty with a pleasant staff.

This is the only place I like to go and shop.  What's not to love, they have great stuff and great prices.  That is the draw.  Sam's has cheap stuff and cheap prices.  And, If you think you only need a Costco membership to buy bulk groceries you are sadly mistaken.  They buy good brand stuff in bulk like watches, jewelry, sun glasses, clothing, etc...  They've had Seven Jeans and Ray Ban stuff in there.  Good wines, furniture, and on and on.  One just go in sometime and walk around looking at everything they have in there.

The be fair and balance out all the reviews of places I want people to go, I had to pick a place that I don't want anyone to go.    Granted, this place would have changed because it has been a couple years since I've been there.  So the first couple times I went there, it felt like an overpriced TGI Friday's and I really had no desire to return.  But no...  We had to do a team lunch there once.  Again, completely forgettable meal, but what I will never forget is two of the guys in my group ordered this one sampler dish.  Compared to the picture on the menu, it literally looked like they split a single portion over two plates.  After taking forever, and then not seeming two concerned when one of my friends said, "I didn't order the kid's portion."  We still laugh and make jokes about this place.  With all the better places around the area, I'm surprised it is still in business.

I've been to this place a few times and always enjoy my meal.  The kids love to run around outside and it gives them something to do while we are waiting for our food.  Although, if you aren't into sitting at a picnic table outside when it is 110 this isn't the place for you especially because it can get crowded and there isn't enough inside seating for everyone.  BUT, that has nothing to do with their food.  I love the garlic and sweet potato fries.  The blue burger is also delicious and the burger was juicy as they should be.  I recently had the Ahi Tune sandwich and LOVED it.  It was different than what I normally get and a GOOD different.  I'm talking the type of good where I'm going to be sitting around and think, "I need to go to Joe's and get me one of them Ahi Tuna sandwiches."  Also BBQ chicken pizza was an A+!

I was so surprised by this place.  We went after visiting the Frick and I would go back again if I lived in the area.  I see some people didn't like the service.  It didn't really bother me, but thinking back they were slow, but not bad.  It has a very laid back feeling to it with a lot of people that just don't seem to be in a hurry.  The food was all eclectic and excellent.  I had some soup and sandwich that I would have a hard time not ordering again.  They use a lot of fresh ingredients and put together a curried chicken sandwich with a perfect amount of spice.  The soup was good as well and had a very fresh taste.  The fish tacos surprised me too.  I ordered them and then had seconds thoughts as I live in the Southwest and have had fish tacos in Ensenada. Well whoever put this on the menu knows what they were doing and put a nice twist on the tacos.  Desserts were very good too and so were the drinks.  My wife had the sangria that was very good and I was impressed by their selection of local micro brews.

This place was awesome.  I was up near Scottsdale and wanted to take some friends to Greek so I checked Yelp the reviews did not disappoint.  I got the Gyro platter.  It was a ton of food.  The meat was great and the pitas were fresh.  Plenty of tzatziki.  One of the best Greek salads I've ever had with plenty of cheese and it was very flavorful.  The rice and potatoes were really good too and I usually don't get to excited about those at a greek place.  I also sampled the falafel (good), baklava (great), and the spanikopita (amazing).  I sort of wish this place was closer to my side of town so I could go there more often.

This place is my go to Mediterranean for lunch.  I really like the gyro and the schwarma beef & lamb plates.  They are both very tasty and I really like the falafel here and usually order a couple on the side with my meal.  The only reason it's not 5 stars is because of the sides.  Everything on the plates besides the main dish is just meh.  Plus I haven't figured out the pita situation yet.  Sometimes you get delicious pita, sometimes you get cardboard pita.  I guess certain types of pitas go with certain dishes?  I don't care, I always want delicious pita, never want cardboard.

The restaurant in this place is excellent.  They have nice outside seating and it has a trendy feel to it as well.  Definitely a treat if you want to get away from the normal crowded chain restaurant areas in the area.  I had the Manzi Panini and loved it.  I'm not much of a sandwich person, but this one was unique enough to make a worthwhile choice while dining out.  My wife had the Lucca which was... OK.  It had a nice taste but was slightly dry; I cannot complain though because there is only so much you can do with turkey and whole wheat bread.  I will surely be back to try out some of the other things on their menu.

Meh about says it.  I've been to this place a bunch of times.  In hindsight I don't know why.  Italian is one of my favorite foods and I've never had anything, other than the garlic bread, that really stands out here.  Yeah the inside is neat and the staff is always good... but the pasta sauce is nothing special.  Everything seems like bland Italian food, in comparison of the many other options in the category especially.  It also isn't cheap.  For chain Italian restaurants, I'd take Olive Garden, Carabba's, Brio.    Also, I somehow end up with in this place with work people or friends that don't like some damn thing.  I'll eat everything, but considering the menu is just OK as it is, I end up getting stuck with the most mediocre dish at a medicre restaurant.  This makes me want to stab someone.  Family style is great if you are with your family, if you are with a bunch of vegetarians... REDRUM! REDRUM!  Yeah yeah, I can get individual orders now.  So I can be THAT guy, that goes to a family style restaurant and is like, NO, I'm ordering my own thing, you all suck.  While YES, that is totally true, I don't want everyone to necessarily know it.  Pizza places is where you are supposed to go with a group of people and argue about what to order, not pasta places.

This place was excellent. Nice ambiance and a great happy hour. The kids menu was nice and the honey chicken was a huge portion and delicious. (I almost don't want to divulge this secret but... next time you want honey chicken from Pei Wei, just come here and get the $4.99 kids meal.)  We liked everything we got; Arizona roll, Crazy shrimp roll, Jalapeno roll, and crunch roll. My favorite was Arizona roll. The wife enjoyed the sea weed salad as well.  Everything was very tasty and fresh! I'm usually not a huge sushi person but this place may have changed me and I will definitely be back here.

This place was excellent.  I'd heard about it and when with my wife and some friends.  We tried a bunch of different things and it was all excellent.  The margarita pizza was delicious.  It had lots of fresh ingredients on it, sauce had a nice flavor, and the dough was just right.   We also got this Cuban pork sandwich and some kind of seafood sandwich.  Everyone liked the Cuban one best, but the other was also great.  Their bread was fresh and so were the ingredients and everything had a great flavor.  The potato salad on the side was one of the best I've ever had.  Also, whatever they gave us for the pre-meal bread, which was like a bruschetta topping, was awesome.  All of this and we didn't even get to try some of their delicious sounding entrees.  The place has a very casual and eclectic feel.  It has a nice mom & pop laid back feel to it and is still trendy with a nice wine & beer selection with a great quiet atmosphere.  If I feel like sitting down to a nice meal with a glass of wine and some good conversation, this is where I would go.

I love this place.  I go here a lot for beers and enjoy the atmosphere in the bar area.  Their beers are all pretty decent especially the Marzen.  The food is really enjoyable.  I actually wish I came here to eat instead of drink to try more things on the menu.  I love the garlic fries.  The lobster bisque is also excellent as well as the southwest egg rolls.  I've had some burgers and other stuff on the menu all of which were good.    It is really only missing some dish on the menu that you absolutely have to go there and get again.

I still love this place.  Got addicted by going to the one by ASU.  The expanded dining area at this one is really nice.  As always $3 car bombs, ginormous beers with a good selection, and pasties is a winning combination.  Recently had the Reuben.  It was super good.  And then there is my old Lamb Vindaloo and Bangers & Mashed favorites.  I actually like too many to usually even stray from the few that I've had an loved.

Ok, I could give this 5 stars, but I'm trying to be fair and not give a biased review because I'm a Pittsburgh fan.  First, the guy who owns his place and the people who run it are some down to earth great people.  I actually ran into him by chance which is how I found out about this place.  When I heard about a hot dog with mac & cheese on it and fried onions, I was all in.  I love a good hot dog, and this place has some seriously good ones.  Plus if you want to get a taste of Pittsburgh with some things like chipped ham, this is the place.  I will be back.

This place is "Meh!"  I've been a couple times with some friends and finally got to the point where I won't go anymore.  I can't say that the place is horrible or that the service is bad, I just personally don't like their food.  The wings I've had are just blah; not crispy and tasting too much likes Frank's Red Hot sauce.  But what really irks me is the pizza.  I prefer New York pizza and grew up back East so I've experienced a lot of good New York style pizza.  I think that always makes me angry that the place is called Streets of New York and the pizza isn't even nearly as good as some slices I'd buy at some random place in the food court of the mall back upstate.  Even if I didn't have that expectation from New York being in the name, I still wouldn't prefer this pizza to pretty much anywhere else in the valley short of Peter Piper or Little Caesars.

I had such high hopes for this place.  Let me start off by saying that I am a breakfast person and very particular.  Breakfast ingredients are cheap and there are not that many unique combinations so it is an absolute necessity that it be done right.  If you are thinking, "Oh! That's me!", this is not the place for you.  First, the staff was friendly but not overly excited or very apologetic that it took 30 minutes to get our food.  It was also unpleasantly warm inside the restaurant.  I might be able understand if the place had been crowded, but it wasn't.  It was half empty at 11 am on a Saturday.  The food was not especially cheap for the quality.  I had the ham steak breakfast which was nearly $10 for ham, eggs, toast, and potatoes.  Here are some thoughts from my meal and what else was ordered at our table:  The ham was tasty but it was sliced ham and not a ham steak.  My over easy eggs were browned* .  The toast was cold*.  The pancakes were fluffy but dry like a biscuit and not spongy.  The home fries were tasteless and undercooked*, unless you like hard potatoes.  The "cream" for the coffee wasn't cream, it was milk.  The sausage patties used were the cheap ones you can buy frozen at Walmart and hardly qualify as meat.   I let out a sigh of relief when we stepped out into the open air; glad to be finally free from waiting for someone to take payment while enjoying the cool breeze rushing across the back of my legs, cooling them as it evaporated the moisture built up from an hour of sitting on a cushion in an over-warm room.  The joy of this moment left me with one final utterance, "Eff that place."  On the bright side, this has motivated me to start writing reviews instead of only reading them.  * denotes things about a breakfast that would make me want to punch a kitten.

Just went here for the first time with my family.  This place is a good time, but if you don't like the idea of an Oktoberfest kind of place with everyone drinking giant liter beers, then don't go here.  The food was good and they really stick to the German types of food.  I had a sampler of some of the wursts and pork roasts.  It was prepared to my liking and tasty.  There wasn't anything that would blow you away, but if you like German food it's a great place.  There were even some things on the menu I've never had before that were fun to try like sauerkraut balls and fried pickles.   I enjoyed their beer as well.  They have a different seasonal brew every month as well as their regulars.  All were good and stick to the German brewing rules.  For comparison though, I liked what I had here better than the similar beers one would find at Gordon Biersch.  Oh yeah, having four people do a shot off a ski in front of the whole place is a good time.  We actually had our kids along and they did great.  Plus the place is so damn loud they can make all the noise they want.  The live music was also a neat experience.  Long story short, I'd like to come back without any kids and get hammered with the crowd there that I can guess gets rowdy as the night goes on.

I love this place.  If it were up to me it would be the only place I'd ever go to happy hour.  The place has a nice atmosphere and it clean with plenty of TVs around the bar area.  They have a reasonable selection on their menu and the food is fine considering it is mostly bar food and that is all I expect.    To really love this place though, you have to know it is all about the beer.  They have a huge selection, frequently changing it up, and throw special events when they bring in new ones.  I have not found another place that is really into their beers like the Monk and that is reason enough for me to give them my business.

I really liked this place.  So obviously I listened to the yelp reviewers and had the pretzel fondue appetizer and it was delicious.  Everyone at the table loved it.  The ambiance of the place is kinda nice, I think I'd enjoy going there for some live music.  It was dimly lit and they had some football on, so all was good.  I had the meatloaf, something I'd never usually order out but I tried it.  It was very good, especially with the mashed potatoes and gravy.  Nice comfort food.  We also had that Spanish thin sliced smoked pork for the table which was great.  I got to try a piece of fried chicken.  While it was no Lolo's, it was damn good.  I'd order it next time.

As a breakfast snob I really do not like Denny's.  They don't really do anything especially well.  Also, I've had inconsistent quality of food and helpfulness of staff on different occasions.  I can't slam this place for one unpleasant waitress, but I can for those inconsistencies and that fact that there are just so many other places that do what they do better.  In fact, this place was the very last Denny's I ever ate.  The food took forever, it wasn't well done, came out all screwed up, and the waitress was unpleasant.  After that experience I decided to never set foot in another Denny's.

I was writing a review about how much I dislike Buca Di Beppo, and it occurred to me that I like this place even less.  I've been to this location before and a few others in different cities.  It's always the same.  I'm looking for something good to eat that would want to bring me back and I've never had that experience here.  Plus there's like a million places in the Southeast Valley that are better, both chain and local.  Yeah the inside is nice, it's close to the mall, staff is fine.  Bla bla.  I even had the Mizithra cheese dish that people seem to rave about.  Buttered spaghetti with some cheese on it.  I make a better side dish in 10 minutes at home.  It is inexpensive, but then again so is Fazoli's.  I did kind of feel like they threw my precooked spaghetti into  hot water like they do at Fazoli's, but I just couldn't see them doing it.

I've been here twice and always have had a good experience.  Being that there are a bunch of great restaurants in the area, Public House holds it's own, and I'd probably be back again.  This place is great for a quieter nice dinner before a night out for sure.  Sometimes I like to get away from places that are slammed and this place provides that opportunity for that.  It has more of an intimate setting, probably good for dates.  They do have some nice drink selections but being fashioned after a gastropub, I'd say their beer selection is kind of weak.  But then again, I'm going here for the food, so let's say it's more gastro than pub.  The food is all good.  Pork Belly Pastrami was amazing and so were the crab cakes, although portions are small, but I expected this.  I've had the meatloaf, which for meatloaf was damn good especially with the glaze.  I'm not really a meatloaf person, but thought it would be good and it was.  Scallops were also very well done.  A friend of mine ordered the mac n' cheese and didn't like it.  I thought she hates everything and tried it and was disappointed.  One might say, yeah but... mac & cheese?  I have had some, like at Smith & Wollensky's, which is unforgettable.    The staff has always been great.  I know I'll be back here. To really go over the top for me I'm looking for something on the menu that I will crave.

I don't know why everyone keeps saying this place is cheap.  They don't even have prices up anywhere that I could see.  It cost me $27 for 6 of us.  So that's about $4.50 a person for a reasonable size serving.  Just as expensive as these cupcake and Coldstone type places.  Anyway, their yogurt was very tasty.  Everything was very flavorful and fresh.  The non fat free versions were very smooth without being too rich as you'd expect from frozen yogurt.  The sorbet was also excellent; probably one of their best.  Red Velvet Cake was also great.  Unsurprisingly, the vanilla and chocolate flavors were "meh," but I have yet to find one of those flavors of frozen yogurt ever that has impressed me.  The inside place was nice in a modern decor kind of way.  It was very clean and there was a decent amount of seating inside.

I had some monster hamburger here which was very good.  The pierogies were awesome too.  Everyone at the table seemed to have a good meal.  I was also pleased with the beer selection, which is pretty much a must if you are going to call yourself a Gastropub.  I feel like if I lived near by I'd be at this place frequently.

More like NOPEopolis.  I'm usually not terribly mean in my reviews but I am still kind of annoyed by this whole ordeal.  I wanted some ribs, checked Yelp for good reviews, decided on a local place over some chain, and FAILED miserably.  Yelp owes me one.  First, I didn't care for the ribs at all.  There was a bit too much spiciness on the ribs and it overshadowed the flavor a bit.  Also, I didn't really care much for any of the BBQ sauces offered and smokiness would have been more prevalent.  More annoying was that the ribs were overdone, which makes me think they were sitting around drying out, or cooked too quickly, and wasn't excited about a bunch of hard pieces of pork.  I tried the pulled pork too and it was underwhelming; Tender, but slightly dry.  This was also not very smokey or flavorful and tasted like bland cooked pork.  Ok, so the meat was... meh.  Side dishes... is where I started posting curses at Yelp on my Facebook page because it was rated 4 stars.  The people who said get Mac & Cheese are out of their freaking minds.  This stuff took me down memory lane, of a time when I was 10 years old and didn't care how food tasted.  Think Ponderosa buffet mac & cheese here; Watery and tasteless.  I believe there was an attempt to bake some real cheese on top so it looked pretty, but I wasn't fooled.  I was excited about cornbread at least... NOPE!  Dry, cake like, and tasteless.  Use a box of Jiffy cornbread mix maybe? Ack! AND, melted margarine all over it?  I thought I was getting punked.  Here is the deal...  Go buy the book from this place back East called Dinosaur BBQ.  It has a recipe in it for cornbread.  Make that.  Yeah, you'll have to buy some actual butter milk and real butter, but so what.  Take some left over butter and melt that on top.  And, use real cheese IN the mac & cheese, not just on top of it.  All that being said... the service was good at least.  And their Moonshine drinks were tasty, although they didn't really cheer me up.  Maybe I should have a had a couple or 10 more.

Well... I've been here a few times and have to write a review.  This place is amazing.  Somehow it seems to get better every time I go.  First couple times I just had like a Hang Over Burger and it was darn good and a little unique with the chilis.  Then I had a BBQ Burger.  Hard competition because ya know, everyone has one on their menu, but I was impressed with their own BBQ and of course, the pretzel bun.  Then I tried the PB&J Burger on a whim.  OMG.  Fricken Amazing.  I mean like amazing enough that I will crave it and have to go for it.  All their sides and tots are great and then I tried the Jamaican corn.  Also amazing and totally unique.  So good I went again last night and totally went PB&J w/ corn.  I had to go back though because I was in NYC and someone who travels to Scottsdale says, oh have you heard of Rehab...  YEAH I HAVE.  Tells me to try the Medium/Gold chicken wings.  So that happened.  Cooked perfectly, sauce was spicy and mustardy and delicious.  Off the charts.  Someone else got the pig wings where were also great.  I'm thinking they ought to put that medium/gold sauce on some pig wings or pulled pork too, it would be great.  At this point, it's going to be hard for me to be in the area and go somewhere else.  Also, I should add that every time I've been the crowd has been good and the service is always great and the people are very friendly.

I went to this place with a groupon the other day.  I haven't tried many of the places in this plaza so I figured I'd give it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It has kind of a intimate atmosphere; not too big with a bar right in the middle with low lights.  I see why they call it a Steak Bar.  They had some nice specials during the week like 50% off bottles of wine on Wednesday, which was a nice change.  I got the marinated rib-eye which delicious.  I never order marinated steaks either, but I figured I'd try something different for once.  The flavor was very nice and the steak had a great char on it and was cooked exactly how I ordered it.  The baked potato was also good and nice that you didn't have to pay for ala carte sides.  The GF got the sliced sirloin steak which was also very good.  Oddly, they really didn't ask how she wanted it done and it was on the rarer side of medium.  I thought that was interesting so I figured I'd warn people.  But really, I shouldn't have to, if you're thinking maybe you want it well done, DERP!  I cook a lot of steaks and when people want them over cooked and then complain about them being tough it makes me  crazy.  Back on topic, we ordered some potato popper things that were awesome for an appetizer.  I would definitely go back to this place again.  It is a nice spot in Chandler that's not really low end or crazy expensive.  I'd definitely go here again over Fleming's.

Yeah, so I was so sick of sandwich shops.  Like 10 years of Subway commercials?  Good god.  Then came Quizno's which was different for like what, a couple days.  I've been at a pretty hard, yeah I can make that at home, for quite a while.  Then I go into Which Wich.   My god, it took me like 15 minutes to even decide what I wanted there the first time and I've been back like 4 times already.  Everything I've ever had has been great and sometimes I put stupid things on my sandwiches that wouldn't even be good, but still is.  Plus, they got Cheese Wiz!

So, after reading some other Yelp reviews, I apparently stumbled into some random house in the barrio complete with porta-potties and swarming attack birds.  Oh and also, Chandler sucks!  Haters goin' hate I guess...  But ANYWAY, that wasn't my experience...  I know they are still in soft opening stages, but I'm giving this place 5 stars.  Are they there yet, no, probably a 4 as they work stuff out.  Are they going to be, I think yes, and if they aren't I'll come back and change it.  First, as far as setting goes... I happen to like downtown Chandler, so I can't really complain that this place is IN downtown Chandler.  I think it is a nice addition to the other great places in the area.  The whole place is very open so It is a welcomed change from being inside all the time.  I like the option of hanging around in the court yard or going up to the roof.  Oh and there are birds.  Not just the rescued ones at the restaurant, which are all in cages, but also flying around outside... because nature is good like that.  The inside has that gastro pub feel I'd expect as well.  Also, yes, the restroom entrances are outside, but they are nice on the inside.  My experience was porta-potty free.  I'll  take the WIFI and accessibility to plugs around the bar too.  Do I want to enjoy a beer while getting some work done while hanging out in the courtyard again?... YUP!  The beer selection was nice.  Honestly that's really why I'd wanted to go here.  I  liked the wide variety of beers that were on tap.  Sours, Fruit beer, IPAs, etc...  Between that and the wine and martini offerings, it gives everyone a little something they can enjoy.  I can't wait to see what kind of beers they make once their own brewery gets going.  Oh I also like the Happy Hour specials and daily beer specials.  I hope they keep that going.  I was actually surprised by the food.  For a beer places I wasn't expecting much, but the eclectic menu has a lot of good stuff that goes well with the beers.  I tried a piece of 3 different pizzas on happy hour and they were all tasty.  The homemade sausage plate was amazing.  A bunch of different mustard to go along with it.  I'll be getting that again.  I know it is only a soft menu so far, but I'm liking what I see.  PLEASE don't listen to complainants about about the menu selections.  We have enough burger places, seriously.  Service.  It was fine by me.  I usually don't expect much from new places, but there were a bunch of staff around helping people out and getting trained.  Even one of the owners was coming around and asking everyone about their experience.  I get the sense that they are really making an effort to provide everyone with a good experience.
