The staff was awesome and they loved Vinny! Not too costly and super clean! Very hard to get on the phone and speak with anyone. You will probably need to stop in to make appts etc.

Although our waitress was super nice, over all disappointing. We had a birthday celebration and had a few extra add ons including a few significant others in which we called well over 8 hours in advanced and apparently they could not even accolade one extra chair which was crap. Through out our meal there was multiple tables and extra chairs all around our party. Also I had a decent pizza and ate a slice packed up the rest to go and left it on the table- no one even had the curtesy to ring us or even let us know when we walked out and left an entire pizza on the table. Customer service below average with sub par food. Wouldn't recommend.
