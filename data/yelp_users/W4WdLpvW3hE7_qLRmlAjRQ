I found this office from Zoc Doc based on the reviews and the proximity to me and was sorely disappointed. First of all, there were far too many people working at the front desk for the lack of patients visiting the office that it almost felt like vultures the second I walked in. I was bombarded with directions on what to do and questions immediately which was a bit intimidating. After all of the preliminary tests that I'm more than accustomed to after years and years of visiting eye doctors, I finally met Dr. Betsko who was less than charming. She had zero personality and was the most unwelcoming doctor I have ever met. She took about 3 minutes tops with my exam and left the room and never returned. I was then escorted out to the front where again I was bombarded with people telling me what my options were for glasses/contacts based on my insurance. I only took this job a few months ago so the insurance is new to me and they did a horrendous job of explaining it to me. I almost felt like they were trying to sell to me rather than help me and I ended up getting the least from the plan because I was so confused and so frustrated with them trying to push things on me. And to top it all off, I was told that my contacts would be ready "no later than Friday" when my appointment was on the previous Wednesday which was perfect considering I was leaving for my wedding less than ten days from my appointment time and wanted to be sure I had backups on my wedding day but they weren't ready until the following Wednesday. I received a text message Wednesday afternoon saying my contacts were ready for pickup but because of the millions of things to do to get ready for me to leave did not make it there until Friday. Unfortunately, no one thought to give a heads up that they would be closed the Friday before Labor Day. I would have appreciated a courtesy call saying my contacts were ready for pickup and to make sure I get them today or tomorrow since they close for a four day weekend but apparently that's too much to ask. I left a voicemail immediately explaining my frustrating and received a return call the day after labor day, when I was already out of town in Texas for my wedding and they assured me they would be overnighting them to me so I would have them before my wedding (on September 6th) and before we checked out of the place we were staying. Here it is September 8th and I still don't have them. We are no longer in the house we had rented for the week and will only be in town for a couple more days before we leave to go back to AZ and I don't have much faith that they will be here by then. This has been THE WORST experience I have had from any doctor's office. Completely unprofessional, unwelcoming and irritatingly lackadaisical about their patient's well-being and requests. I will NEVER go back here.

Stop. If you're even thinking about living here. Don't.   Management is AWFUL! they are so extremely disorganized and blame everything on everyone else in the office. They are extremely unprofessional and do not care about residents at all.   The location is pretty good but the rent is still way too high for everything that lacks. The gym is a JOKE. The decor inside is so outdated it's not even funny. They promised updates with the new management but all that happened was an increase in rent ECG month for nothing. I haven't had a single update to my unit, yet new residents are getting brand new aspects to their units that I'm apparently paying for because I have seen nothing new come from my increase in rent.   I have NEVER loved anywhere that doesn't offer some sort of incentive to renew one's lease yet they wanted to charge almost $100 more to renew with no increase in amenities or incentive.   The management is rude and unprofessional and I just would not waste my money at this terrible complex.   I wish I had gone back and signed a lease at CityScape or Grigio or anywhere but here.

I've been here a few times now and every visit, the staff have been rude and uninviting. They seem much more interested in conversing with one another than serving the customers. The barista taking my order always acts like its such an inconvenience to do her job. I've been a loyal Starbucks customer for years and have frequented stores across the country and this is by far the worst customer service I've received at a Starbucks.  Also, apparently a 3/4 full cup constitutes as "no room for cream, please."

This place is awesome! The pizza was fantastic and could feed an army and the calamari was perfectly crispy and flavorful. The service was so-so in the dining room but the bartender was really super cool. We stuck around the bar for a couple hours to watch the game and talk with her and the many regulars that hang out around the bar area. The manager was one of the most on the ball and helpful managers I have ever witnessed within an establishment.   I would highly recommend this place for anyone in the area as it is in East mesa.

I try to live by the phrase "if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all" but my negative experience here has really been bugging me and it's based on things that are completely preventable so I feel the need to point a few things out. As someone who put myself through college by working in the service industry, I have no patience for lazy and rude servers and it really irritates me when I go out to eat somewhere and am treated like I am an inconvenience for the one serving me. That's how I felt here. Our server was a young woman who from the moment we sat down was so nonchalant and unaccommodating that it made me want to leave within a few minutes. She didn't write anything down and came back to our table twice to get the correct order because surprisingly, she couldn't remember it all. Our food took an extremely long time and by the time we got it, it was luke warm and SO salty. I only took a few bites of it and told my fiance that we needed to leave. It then took us another 15 minutes to wave her down to get our check and all she did was place it on our table and walk away. Not even a "thank you" or "have a nice night". In the 15 minutes we waited, I looked around to observe the other servers and noticed one woman in particular who looked so annoyed at everything that was happening around her. She would literally roll her eyes while walking away from a table and push other servers out of the way to get to the bar well. This made me so uncomfortable just being around her. IF we ever eat here again, it will be to-go. I will never step foot in this restaurant again as a result of the extremely poor service and morale of the employees there. It was sad.

One of the best sandwiches I've ever had! The meat was fresh and delicious. It looked and tastes as if it was cut right off the turkey breast. My husband got the Thai Chicken Wrap and loved it! I would highly recommend it!

I recently took my pot belly pig to the North Phoenix location and was blown away at how friendly, professional, and helpful all the staff were. They made me feel comfortable with the neuter procedure and didn't pressure me into additional tests and bells and whistles like other vets I have been to always seem to do. They made sure that my pig got the best care possible and all of my questions were answered. They even called the day after to see how he was doing after his surgery. I have never had a vet do that and the gesture was greatly appreciated. I would highly recommend Dr. Lamb and the staff at the North Phoenix Arizona Exotic Animal Hospital!

They were fantastic! Kelly took amazing care of me during the initial process and the guys that came out to replace my windshield were done in less than 45 minutes and extremely nice. I would recommend them to anyone and will be using them for any future issues.

We had been wanting to go here for months after a few suggestions from friends, but mostly just after many times ofdriving or walking past the establishment and seeing it filled with people. After finally deciding to give it a shot, it wasn't long before we wondered why. The service was awful. The bartenders were inattentive and not at all communicative between one another in order to provide adequate service. I didn't think it was possible but the service was even worse once seated at a table outside. The waitress was not at all friendly or even accommodating. She acted as if she could not care less about us or any of our questions. To top it off, I ordered a beer that was then brought to me by some random guy who set it down, said something about it being "a shorty", and walking away. Come to find out, this 4.5 ounce beer cost $4.00 because the keg went out. When asked about the price, the manager came over to explain that they don't know when the keg will run out so it was the best they could do, and I was given and charged the price appropriate based on what was left. At this point, I was SHOCKED To find out that all this time, the Angel's Trumpet, did not, in fact, hire psychics to run their establishment for the sole purpose of sensing when each keg will tap throughout he night. Mind blown. Turns out though, despite the lack of psychics and service industry "professionals" on staff, the beer, regardless of how full or how great the quality is,still comes at quite the cost. The manager was nice enough to knock about 50 cents off the price of my sub par and anything but full glass, and apparently that was even asking too much by the look on her face and the snobby motions of her hands. I could go on and on, but frankly, I've already arrived at somewhere MUCH cooler that actually has beer that I can drink and I've already given this place more recognition than it deserves.

Every time I go to this Starbucks it takes forever. The drive thru is so disorganized and the employees are not friendly at all. If you're ever in a hurry and just want to grab a cup of coffee, avoid this one. I recently swing by to order cold brew and it wasn't until I got to the window that they told me they didn't have any. Destiny, the drive thru barista, did not apologize or offer a substitution and didn't even say "thank you." This is not an uncommon interaction with anyone at this location. It's really disappointing.

I absolutely LOVE Orangetheory. I've been going for almost 2 weeks now and I'm already down 6 pounds and over 1% body fat. I had been plateauing for a couple weeks but with my wedding coming up in a little less than a month, I knew I didn't have time for that and that's when a good friend of mine introduced me to Orangetheory. Everyone there has been absolutely fantastic! By my second class, almost every trainer, including the studio manager, knew my name and greeted me by name when I walked in the door. I instantly felt comfortable there which I feel like not many people can say about gyms. The trainers have been very encouraging each time I'm in there and the workouts are incredible. It has completely taken my fitness to the next level and it's safe to say that I'm addicted. They offer free consultations with a new membership and I did mine with Matt. He provided me with a meal plan (one that I was already pretty much following but the gesture was awesome), did my measurements, body fat percentage, and showed me exercises to help target the areas I was trying to focus on. He even offered to switch up and modify things for me during class knowing what my goals were, and share that with the other trainers there knowing I wouldn't always be in his class. I don't know any group fitness class, instructor, or gym that would do something like that! Orangetheory has completely transformed how I look at my workouts and the science behind it is fascinating, not to mention it really works. I LOVE IT!

I recently held a happy hour event for Realtors at Beach Club Cantina and it was a blast! I worked with Peter, the owner, for a few weeks leading up to the event to plan everything out and he was so gracious and helpful throughout the process, as tedious as it was and given the circumstances beyond either of our control. The Realtors and Lenders who showed up to the event were very impressed with the restaurant and the quality of the food and drinks. Everyone had a great time and the staff was very accommodating. We are looking forward to another great event here in the future!

I have been going to Orangetheory for over a year now and am just as obsessed with it today as I was at the very beginning. The workouts are always something different, never boring, and the trainers are all so professional, knowledgeable and helpful. I've had the best results of my life thanks to Orangetheory's workouts and caring trainers and staff. OTF truly is a family and I can't imagine going anywhere else to get in shape in a fun and energetic environment!

We have gotten take out from this location a few times and it's always missing things or put in the wrong boxes with the wrong sides, etc. One time we ordered queso to go and it looked and tasted more like refried beans than queso. It was absolutely disgusting. We recently decided to dine in and watch football on a Sunday though, hoping for a better experience. Unfortunately, we had no such luck. The bartender, Jarrod, was offensive, rude and belligerent the entire time. He made some borderline racist comments, tried WAY too hard to be funny but just came off as an ass instead, cussed repeatedly and put down customers and their sports teams to their faces. Jarrod definitely wasn't the type of employee I imagine Chili's hiring and putting up with and believe they would be just as shocked at his behavior behind the bar as we were. In fact, the overall organization and service at this establishment is an embarrassment to Chili's and should be evaluated. In the mean time, if you're looking for quality food, cooked to your specification, go somewhere else, or drive to the litchfield Park Chili's instead. You'll be glad you did.
