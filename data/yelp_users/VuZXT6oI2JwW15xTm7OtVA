Excellent Thai food! A must-visit place form those who love Asian food. Food is superb. Service is excellent, and the prices are VERY reasonable. Hope they open more locations in the valley!

Nice restaurant inside. Nice location. Excellent staff. I dont like leaving negative reviews, but the food was "edible" at best. No flavor and everything tasted like it was out of a can. I'm glad we had a groupon that someone bought us or else I would have had a tough time coughing up the $50 for dinner. Maybe it was an off night for them...who knows. Don't think we'll be going back. Try Marco's Italian bistro up the road. Great place.

Dale is a class act guy and very professional. His work is exceptional and his attention to detail is second to none. We change cars pretty regularly and he has done about 5 cars for us now in the past couple years. He comes to your house and his fees are VERY reasonable. We paid more down in Tucson at a place that we still had to drive our cars into. The product dale uses holds up in the AZ heat and keeps the car very cool. Hes easy to schedule with, shows up on time and is very thorough with his work. A true master of his craft. On top of that, hes a fun guy to talk with if you have time hang in the garage while he works!

Nice restaurant inside and excellent staff. Prices are reasonable and the food is very tasty! not sure why its not busier inside...kind of a tucked away location. The chef/owner is super nice and takes the time to make his rounds to visit his guests. Class act.
