exceptional albacore salad and white tuna sashimi.  Rolls were prepared in a timely manner, looked as good as they tasted.

Best NY style slice in AZ.  I used to go 2-3 times a week when I lived around the corner but now I cant remember the last time Ive been in.  What i do remember is this,  the slices are huge.  One was usually all it took and I would rarely finish two.  super cheap too, a slice and a drink for only 5 bucks is a no brainier.  If you want trendy foofoo pizza go to cibo or bianco, if you want authentic Italian go to Pomo, but if you want a good ol NY slice go no where else but Venezias.

The portions are FAMILY STYLE!  made this mistake? and had tons of leftovers.  Very good approach to typically recognized dishes.  The orange chicken was excellent and actually tasted "orangey" due to cut up orange slices in the sauce.  Sweet and sour pork was fresh and served  hot.  Egg drop soup was average.  Prices were reasonable.

Tried this place after many neighbors recommended it.  It definitely lives up to their praise.  Really good slice!  Prices are excellent as well.  Pizza for 3 with garlic knots and drinks, fifteen bucks.  It's hard to compare pizza joints by ingredients in a review but I'll say; on par with venezias, definitely better than the chains (Pizza Hut, dominos, etc...) edges out barros.  Worth a try for sure.

Spinners is by far the best "home base" pro shop I've ever had.  Back home it was play it again sports or academy sports neither of which had a great selection.  The prices seem a bit high but are comparable with other vendors.  The best thing about this pro shop is that it's right on the course!  Hole 12.... Or hole 1 for locals.

I was referred to SM last summer by a co worker  when I bought my first (pre-owned) boat.  I took it in and asked for a complete boat "physical" so-to-speak and was impressed when they only recommended a few inexpensive tune ups.  They had the boat tuned up and lake ready in no time and explained everything they did and even suggested things I could do myself in the future.  This week I took my boat in because the engine wouldn't crank.  They diagnosed the problem and it turned out to be a very minor wiring issue.  Again, they had the opportunity to create a big bill but were honest and didn't even charge me for it.  I was only billed for 30 mins of labor which is the time the mechanic took to diagnose the problem.  The staff are friendly and explain everything then offer tips and advice on what could be done at home vs. bringing it to them.  They have earned a customer for life and I would recommend them to any boat owners out there.

Good work, fast service.  Little pricey for just removing links from a new watch though.

Got my O/W cert with these guys back in 2011 and just returned for a refresher before going to Hawaii for some diving.  I recognized most of the staff right away (Stephen and Fernando) and my refresher dive was with a new instructor.    If you are at all interested in scuba diving, talk to Stephen, he'll hook you up!  Staff - very friendly and knowledgeable  Pricing - reasonable and comparable   Very good full service dive shop I'm glad to call "home base"

Moreno's is a great local spot with good food and friendly staff.  I've even gone for breakfast a time or two and was pleasantly surprised.    Pricing is on the lower end which makes it even easier to go more often.

It seems Ibeach has gone out of business which does not bode well because I just paid them for one month of tanning for my fiance and I (5-13-3013).  I will say that when I was able to tan (only one week)  the service was fine and the machines were always clean and in good working order.  I now face trying to decide If seeking a refund is worth the potential hassle.....good thing I paid with a credit card instead of debit which is easier to dispute.  I went to celebrity tanning and learned few things.  They seem to be a more established comapny with more locations and comparable pricing plans.  The employee I spoke with was knowledgable and willing to work with me to transition my business from Ibeach.    Hopefully I can work out some kind of deal with them to make an easy transition and not waste more money.

Update to my last review http://www.kpho.com/story/22420825/customers-say-ibeach-tan-closed-without-notice-not-providing-refunds.  Hopefully you others paid with a credit card.  I have successfully had all charges reversed through my CC company.  Nice little "fuck you" to the ibeach owners who will not issue the refunds themselves.  I encourage all others to do the same.

Found this diamond in the rough while working in the area.  I will definitely be returning often.  I recommend the number 7 but swap out the beef burrito and replace it with a "chevos" burrito.  Very tasty!  The restaurant is clean and the food is fresh and served hot (temp).  The soda machine dispenses good soda (not flat or too syrupy)  Brush up on your Spanish if you want bonus points with the staff.

Its good for what it is but not my idea of a good slice of pizza.  I'm a die hard new york style pizza slice type of person.  I did like the "build your own pie" aspect of the process and it was good with fresh, tasty ingredients.     The price wasnt bad either but I'll save a couple bucks and get a slice and

excellent pastrami!    I tried going for dinner twice but the hours are pretty much business lunch only.  When i finally got down there they were only open later because of a ball game.  Limited hours aside, the food is top notch and they do catering which is great if you work downtown.  The pastrami is fresh and flavorful.  Pricing is moderate but not too bad.    The owner and his staff were super friendly and conversational.

You will never feel more American than when you eat a hot dog at Nana Tees!  The first thing I tried was the Sonoran Dog and it was great!  So many things looked so good I wish I could have tried them all.  I can't wait to go back and try something new.  BTW their homemade salsa is award winning... Literally!  Very friendly, easily conversational staff and reasonable pricing.     08/01/16  Been going back since and found a new favorite... The Philly! very tasty with a brat.
