I called in with tooth pain Friday morning and Dr. Schwartz was able to see me at 10:30 for an emergency visit.  He was great at explaining what was going on and the best course of action.  He has a beautiful and clean office and his staff is really helpful and friendly.  He has hospital trained specialists on staff which is great because I want the best care possible for my teeth.  I can't recommend Dr. Schwartz enough. l really lucked out finding him and am grateful for everybody that has reviewed him on Yelp.

Unfortunately this is another bad review for both Fosters pool service and Old Republic home warranty.  My biggest issue with Fosters is that they do not answer calls or return voice mails... over the period of 2 weeks I left countless voice mails trying to get them to come fix the problem they diagnosed, they never returned one call.  I had to have another pool company come out and and take care of the problem.  As it turns out, Fosters misdiagnosed the problem and the other pool company that came out fixed everything and was much better.    Old Republic home protection/warranty is a completely different level of bad service and I will be leaving reviews on them as well.  If anyone tries to send Fosters out, dont let them because it is a waste of time.

We have had pizza delivered a few times, and we've loved everything we have tried. The 18" pizza is huge and they are always quick on delivery.

Went to 20/20 image for the first time, Dr. Peterson gave me the best exam I've ever had.  I've been wearing glasses for years, but This is hands down the best prescription I've ever had. I will be recommending Dr. Peterson and 20/20 to anyone I can.

I was referred to Jay and he really offers a personal touch.  Ive always gotten my insurance from faceless internet providers.  Now that I have a child and more to protect I was getting uncomfortable not understanding my coverage.  I met with Jay, we reviewed my current coverage, showed me what was good, and what I was missing.  He got me some additional protection and actually saved me money on my premiums.  I love the bundling discounts and the drivewise technology is extremely cool and will save us even more money.  I am so grateful I was referred to Jay, and I am referring everyone I can to him.

Just found this place, just in a residential neighborhood.  For some reason I really felt like a meatball sub today, so I searched Yelp for "best meatball sub" and b&g showed up. The 5 star reviews are not a mistake.  I got a hot meatball Parmesan Sub for me and my wife, we both loved it and want to go there for dinner this weekend.

I have never had a worse experience with a company... ever.  The workers and managers at golden eagle moving are deceitful and down right hateful.  We were over charged and they used our items being in their possession as leverage to make us pay more than agreed.  On top of that they did several thousand dollars of damage and lost several items. Including a $550 dyson vacuum, $300 steam mop and other things.  Even scarier is they delivered at least 10 items and decorations that weren't ours.   After weeks of fighting on the phone with them, I went to the warehouse in tempe to try and find our vacuum we were desperately needing.  I forced my way in their storage area and was disgusted with what I found.  They treat our furniture like crap.  Piled all around a welding/autobody/garage and you could never tell one families items from another.  The people there got pretty upset when I started taking pictures and they were pretty ashamed.  I've gotten no resolution for my damaged/lost items. I am now taking them to small claims court to get back some of our loss.  Feel free to reach out to me and I will gladly help you do the same.  I have never been around bigger crooks.
