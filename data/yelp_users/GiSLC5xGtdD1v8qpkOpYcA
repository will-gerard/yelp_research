I finally understand what other yelp reviewers mean when they say, "I wish I could give this business 0 stars." This complex doesnt deserve a star, it deserves to be torn down and used as more parking space for the Arrowhead Mall. The enormous problem (which will inevitably put them out of business) is every single member of the office staff. They are rude, unprofessional, and horribly trained. They lost our payments, even though we had confirmation emails, and said it was our fault, and that we had to figure it out, and in turn charged us late fee's. They were constantly giving incorrect information. And somehow never took any responsibility for anything. They will nickle and dime you for everything. For example, when they told us they hadn't recieved our rent, not only did they charge us late fees, they charged for things such as "processing". Whatever that means. When we moved out, they charged us because our microwave wasn't fucking clean. They basically charge you if you blink the wrong way. If you go into the office and ask three different people the same question, you will get three different answers. They took away the night drop box on site for turning in rent because it was easier for THEM, not the residents. So everything you have to do online. This business is not client oriented. That's the bottom line. They should re-name their complex Reserve at Asshead. That is all.

Brand new place. Only a week and a half old! The menu is simple, but the food is delicious. I had a strawberry glazed donut with sprinkles, which was really good and fresh. Not dry or stale. But my favorite part was the ham, cheese, and jalape√±o croissant! Yum! I'll be craving one of those every day! The proprietor is very kind. I'll definitely be visiting again, soon!
