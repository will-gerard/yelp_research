One of the most ridiculous and scarring experiences of my life. I've bought many vehicles in my life and these people are SNAKES. We have multiple salesman in my family and they despise people like them. I would NEVER recommend this dealership to ANYONE. The manager, Jim, tried to tell me they don't have a return policy like I'm a moron and would believe whatever he said. Lied about the manager above him being in and thought he could make me take the car home another day so he would have a chance to get rid of my car and leave me with no other choice. Manipulative and distasteful. Finance department tried to tell me that my pay off wasn't being added to my loan, but that they had to 'show it in the paperwork' upon further research... That's exactly what they did! Added it to my loan amount and tried to tell me it wasn't. My husband called and had to make them understand that we were leaving with my car otherwise they'd be sorry. I'm at the end of my pregnancy and yet they thought upsetting me (with a toddler in tote) was acceptable behavior. Beware of this place. Do your research.

We took our little girl here on a Sunday night as a treat. No one was in there but us, so that was a HUGE plus! No kids pushing past mine to get to games. I was a little unimpressed with the amount of games, but she had a blast. We had trouble with two games, but the employees came quickly to fix the problem and even gave my daughter a prize for the game malfunctioning :) I'm not a big pizza lover but I really liked the pizza and my side salad wasn't too bad either! The cashier was very friendly and very willing to help! It was very clean and they continued to clean while we were there. Would only wish for the play area to be cleaner. You could see the dirt on the slides and we took our daughter out of that area.   All around, I was happy to have pleasant employees. It's very rare to have people be kind these says in the service industry. Which is a shame.

Horrible service! We walked in and sat down, a young guy watched us and proceeded to bring menus to two ladies who came in after us. Looked at us twice and still no acknowledgment. Asked a manager  for a server even after he had ALSO looked but not acknowledged. Great job manager! We ordered drinks and waited and waited for our server to return. We ended up leaving. Will not be returning.

We take both our vehicles here for EVERYTHING down to oil changes. I've never had a problem and never been told something needed to be repaired that wasn't really having a problem. Great prices and employees are awesome and easy to talk to!!

I always come here for pretty much everything I need for my two girls! Kids grow too fast! Why pay retail?!

If I could put ZERO stars I would.  I went to this location to get my screen fixed on my IPhone 5c. They told me it would only take 20 minutes and it was near my work so I decided to go there. I went in, Had it fixed, paid the $115 and left. On my drive home to CHANDLER, I received a text and swiped the screen and it glitches red and blue. I call them right away to tell them, and while I'm in the call, I can't hear very well. I told them that as well and was told to bring it back in. I stated that I work and wouldn't be able to right away. "no problem". well, I didn't get a good feeling about waiting, just knowing my luck I'd get told it isn't their fault since I didn't come right back. I drove THRITY minutes BACK to Scottsdale to take my phone back, for a problem THEY caused. Remember, I had a cracked screen and now I couldn't hear AND it had glitches.   As soon as I walk in, I make it clear that I am UNHAPPY and expected some sort of compensation considering I paid $115 and had to take MY time and GAS to drive all the way back, for THEM causing an issue on my phone. After I sat down, I hear the Guy (I'm assuming the owner) tell the tech "see these wires, they're not supposed to be touching... that's why she couldn't hear" THAT right there, is his acknowledging they're at fault. After testing out the phone, and having me check it, they put everything back together and tell me I'm "good" He then proceeds to tell me, "Hopefully you don't break your phone again, but if you have any other devices that need to be fixed, I'll give you 10% off" I told him I wasn't satisfied with that. He simply stated, said "ok"   SO..... This man's tech replaced my screen, but caused a hearing issue in my phone, which required me to RETURN to Scottsdale from CHANDLER and he thinks I'm going to bring any other services back to him to get a discount "next time". I WON'T be going back, and I DEFINITELY won't be recommending them to anyone.

The owner did in fact replace my screen for the second time,, AFTER my husband had to call and speak to owner since he continued to talk to me like I could be convinced what he had to say goes. NOT my style. The phone has continued to glitch.... testing multiple times in store cannot guarantee it to replicate the problem. You can't actually believe that people are idiots. And as for a last thought... my phone is shattered again, from a VERY short fall. I dropped my phone with the ORIGINAL APPLE screen multiple times and such a soft fall didn't affect it. Whatever brand was used to replace is not a very good quality brand.

TERRIBLE. AWEFUL... ordered a pasta dish and watched it get cut out of a plastic envelope through the drive through window. Child meal didn't come with a drink?!?! My salad was thrown into the box. The dressing size was about a tablespoon for a large salad. My Greek salad with chicken also had the ends of the lettuce head.. GROSS. My husband had to GO BACK because his 'small' was more like a child size, or a side to a meal. PATHETIC. The hibiscus tea tasted like it came from a package. The rolls were not even in a small paper package, just put in the bag unwrapped. Disappointed, will NEVER go back there!! What happened to Paradise bakery?!?! BRING THOSE BACK!!! AWEFUL FOOD HERE!
