Best Pizza in Phoenix...Period!!   Sweet sauce.   Crispy crust.   Never have had a bad experience here and I have been here at least 10 times. Staff is always welcoming and polite. Also if you happen to have room at the end of your meal order the fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.

So I am not usually in the Tempe area, but a friend told me about this place. So I though I would go try it out. I got a Grande Latte that was around $4. Not a bad price. But what made it worth it was that I guess this Friday I went was a Free Shot Friday. So I got an extra Espresso shot in my latte making it a triple for $4 bucks...no that is a deal. Not sure if they always have the promotion on Fridays. But it sure did make my morning a little better.  Their menu is very easy to read and give those no too educated in the was of coffee a good description of what each drink is and how it is made.  The had a ton of great looking pastries even though I didn't sample any. Cakes, Eclairs, Scones, and I think even what looked like cheesecake.   The decor was very interesting. An old fashion coffee house meets a gypsy vibe. I think they have Wifi too. I saw a few people on there computers.  The service was a little slow I think. Felt like I was waiting for my drink for 10 minutes and the place was not really that busy. This was probably because of the guy ahead of me when I walked in who had about 7 different modifications to his drink. I have worked in a coffee place and those people are kind of annoying. So I will let them slide on the time of service.  Overall a great experience. Would have been 3 stars, but when you get something for free, in my book that is an automatically another star.

Good happy hour prices. Nice beer selection. Staff was very nice. The place overall has a great mellow vibe. Great place to unwind downtown after work. Better than sitting in traffic. Check this place out.

I was looking for a good diner to eat at and this place hit the spot. Tried the biscuits 'n gravy everyone on yelp talked about. They did not disappoint. They where fluffy, warm and covered with chorizo gravy. Delicious! A great deal at $2.99!! They also have a special everyday. I went on a Sunday, so it was Eggs Benedict with home fries for $8.99. They where also great.  I placed my order and it was out and on my table in a flash.   The only down side was the price of a large orange juice, $3.99! A bit steep for orange juice even if it was fresh squeezed. Not even sure it was. That won't stop me from going back.   I left there full and satisfied. Over all it was a great meal.

Great Place to grab a cup of STRONG Coffee! First off this is not your chained owed coffee shop where you need to know another language just to order a drink. The prices are reasonable and they always ask if you want the drink hot or iced. I got a endless drip coffee for $2.50. Also I like steamed milk in my coffee and they added some for no extra charge which was pretty cool of them.   They have a killer selection of crepes all around $6 and are good sized. One that caught my eye was the Peanut butter, banana, and raspberry jam. They separate them into to menus the "Savory" crepes, and the "Sweet". I didn't try one this time but will for sure be back to have one.   It is pretty small inside but they have a huge out side sitting area that is covered. A great place to sit and watch all the action that is going on of 5th st. On the weekend they are open till 4 am and serve their full menu till then. So if you are looking for a late night bite or a sobering cup o joe. Check out Jobot!!!

This place is great! I mean how many Nacho places, where they only sell nachos are there? Plus you get to eat them with Chopsticks.  They have some really cool kinds of nachos too. Not your average Chips and Cheese. I recommend there Buffalo Chicken nachos with melted blue cheese sauce. You have never tasted anything like them. They have one with hot dogs, one with what seems to be a beef, like pot roast, and for you veggies they have a nacho for you. You also get a choice of green or red salsa on the side.  The price my be a little of a shock around $7 dollars, but they are well worth it. The portions are enough for 2, or 1 drunken person stumbling over from The Lost Leaf.   So go try something different and you to will fall in love with this place. Look for the big Neon sign that says "Munchies"

Don't believe the hype. Very overpriced for the quality and portions of the dishes. I guess rich Scottsdale folks don't mind paying $17-$20 a dish, for average Chinese food. The portions should have been priced at half the amount. The menu was limited and small. We even preordered the Peking Duck, $40, and they served it with floor tortillas! Really? They were more like chicken burritos. They didn't use rice wraps, and it wasn't even that great. Some of the dishes came to us Luke warm. They were probably holding them to bring out all at once. Overall if you never had really good Chinese food to compare this too and have the means to pay for overpriced dishes. (Our total bill was $260 for 8 people, not including tip.) to be honest the only saving grace was the crab puffs. They were good, but also over priced. The service was also very good. They even did sweet and sour chicken, with sauce on the side for my picky cousin.
