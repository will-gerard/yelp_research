The first time I came here it was really good. I got a burger because that's what they're known for and it was delicious. Maybe being a little tipsy might have something to do with it.  My boyfriend hated the place. He hated the food and hated the server. She wasn't attentive at all. The wings were chewy,  which means they deep fried frozen wings. I tried to tell him he was being very critical.        The next time I went there, I was there with a friend and sans boyfriend. After a bit of drinking I decided it was time to go home. Earlier I convinced my boyfriend to give them another chance in the food department and picked us up some food to-go, burgers because they were so good. I live within walking distance from the place and when I got home, i noticed the burgers were practically raw. I called the bar and told them what happened, and they ask me to come back so they could replace my food. My boyfriend wanted no part of that, and wanted a refund for his food. After the bartender assured me that my food will be cooked properly I came in and picked up my replacement food. He was also good enough to refund me a couple of my drinks from earlie which made up for the hassle. That burger he cooked himself and it was good. He also took the lady who made my burger off the grill.      Today I went there and picked up some food to go. The same lady who cooked my burger before, was working the grill. I didn't want to be a dick and ask for someone else to cook it and I decided to give her another chance. Before I left the bar, I checked my burger to make sure it was cooked all the way, and again it was raw. So I asked the server to have her cook it a little longer, and when I got home it was ok but then my fries were cold. All in all, it's a pain in the ass to try to get food cooked properly there. If you like rare hamburgers, this will be the place for you.

I'd like to give them no stars but I didn't have that option.  I ordered food for delivery once and they took an hour and a half.  They got lost and didn't bother calling me for directions even though I gave them my number specifically for that reason.  My food was cold and I didn't get my entire order.  They suck! Don't eat there.

I ordered food from here fifteen minutes before they opened thinking that it would speed up the process.  The guy who answered the phone said they will be here an hour from when they opened.  No big deal, but it took them thirty minutes longer than they quoted. I ordered the sweet and sour pork lunch special.  It's very bland, just fried meat with sauce,  no vegetables.  I thought they would come with the usual onion, bell peppers and pineapple, but no.  I got noodles instead of rice. The noodles are also bland.  I'm never going to order or eat here again.  Save your money,  call someone else for delivery.  If was to go out to a restaurant, I would go to golden Phoenix. They are where it's at.

I ate here today for the first time. It's not really a "sit down" kind of restaurant, but the food was very good.  I had the two tacos meal and iced tea. The taco meat was flavorful, the beans didn't taste like canned refried beans, the rice was really good, and the tea was freshly brewed. It's filibertos-ish by way of the menu  but WAY better in quality of the food.  There was a huge line after we got there but people were in and out pretty quickly.

I wish I could leave zero stars.  Ugh every time I go there,  the mess something up.  They really know how to screw up the simplest orders. The cashiers are not friendly, or competent. When you try to call their number to complain, you don't get an answer. This location was the replacement of the one on 7th street and Indian school because they sucked so bad,  but it looks like I'll just stop having it all together.
