Chalk this one up to one of those - I Should have read reviews BEFORE making my appointment lessons.  Honestly- I think of Yelp when we want food or fun- it really had not occurred to me that medical PROFESSIONALS would have scores of negative reviews on here.  It sure does now after my experience at TOCA.  As with many of my Yelp reviews- I have blogged my entire experience in full for anyone that is inclined to read more than the 5000 character limit that Yelp provides you can do that here: https://gerouxcrew.wordpress.com/2015/04/08/run-for-the-hills/  Pros: They took my insurance (Health Net PPO), they had an appointment within a few days (while others I called were booking weeks out) , I had two friends that saw a specific doctor at Toca for a similar ailment as mine and both of them had good experiences.  Cons: I could not get in with the Doc my friends experienced so settled for Dr Zoltan.  Had to go to Tempe where their office parking situation is a complete nightmare. An appointment is just a suggested time for when you will be seen- but if you are late they will cancel and bill you. (one thing I loathe about medical establishments)- in my case my appointment was later than it was supposed to be because an older gentleman came in without an appointment and they "squeezed him in before me being taken back *RED FLAG!  Office staff: When calling to make my appointment they were ok- when I checked in one lady was super nice and when we left the appointment they were on top of wanting to "help" but it was far too late at that point.  Doctor Zoltan: rude, rushed, condescending and disengaged.  We brought MRI images with us to my appointment (I had injured my knee a week prior while doing a fun run obstacle course event--Urgent care X-rays were clean but MRI done by Simon Med was showing that I had a completely torn ACL and  2nd degree MCL tear this is why I was seeking out an orthopedic doctor)  Doctor spent about 3 minutes in the exam room with us, manipulated my knee for a few seconds and then left to read the MRI and report.  When he came back he said he did not think my MCL was torn because I was not showing pain the way he felt I should be showing it a week out from the injury.  He then said my ACL is torn but not completely and is likely a tear I had long before this injury and was just unaware of it. (???really?? that is interesting) Doc wants to do "aggressive therapy" and check me in a few months but no surgery at this time- I had to pretty much beg him to stop from walking out the door so I could ask 2 quick questions both he replied with "yup and sure" as responses as he was walking away- he then did a little point of his finger and wink at my husband and was gone.  Total direct time with Doctor for this orthopedic consultation was less than five minutes.  PT came in and fitted me for a brace (which I had to request-that was one of my 2 questions) so at least I did get SOMETHING out of this appointment.  Nurse informed us Doc wanted to see me again in 4 weeks and I made it abundantly clear that we would not be returning.  Both the nurse and PT were totally not phased by my remarks or by my husband stating that we felt very poorly cared for at this visit and for the most part they just shrugged us off with forced sympathetic smiles and left the room. Total time from when the doctor walked in to the exam room to when we were leaving the building was 23 minutes which included him reviewing my MRI images, and me getting fitted for a brace.  I will be seeking out another opinion (technically a 4th opinion at this point since both the MRI imaging Xray Tech and Urgent Care doctor read my images differently than Dr Zoltan- who didn't even take the time to explain what he did see or did not see in the MRI when he looked at it.  After reading the other reviews on here about the lack of thorough patient care and attentiveness- everything I experienced seems to be pretty typical at this office.  I strongly urge others to seek care elsewhere.

Prices for tokens and pizza have gone up,  likely to accommodate their new menu offerings. I was excited to see some new sandwich offerings but disappointed that I couldn't order the one I wanted (bbq chicken) as they were out of several of the ingredients.  Cashier was not trained well on the menu offerings or the register keyboard and paired her incompetence with a lackluster attitude. Frustrated that it took more than 30 minutes for a single individual sized cheese pizza to arrive at our table during a very low capacity mid week lunch time. All of that said- the manager of this establishment blew me away by noticing that we were less than thrilled and went above and beyond in trying to turn the day around for my son (without me asking).  He noted that Ty was filming with figurines and spoke in length with him about his hobbies and the animatronics (Tyler has autism so this made his day) We will drive to this Mesa location in favor of others just due to this experience.

Over the last 10 years I have had several misc. home delivery subscriptions with the Arizona Republic (yes I am one of the dinosaurs that still likes to feel the paper in my hand each morning PLUS the COMICS man the COMICS!)  The last 2 subscriptions have been met with nothing but billing issues, missed deliveries and missing coupons.  I have had 2 negative experiences with the Republic when it comes to cancelling a subscription and still getting billed- which have led me to no longer want home delivery from them ever again. Receiving a refund for this faulty billing requires no less then hours of emails, phone calls, at least 1 hand written snail mail letter, and the promise of your first born as a paper delivery boy. (ok so the last one was a exaggeration but still)  When we moved from a home in Gold Canyon in Dec of 2009 we cancelled a month to month subscription until we got settled into our new place (we did not want the paper going wasted)  I was asked what day I wanted the cancellation effective and I told them "immediately." The very next day we stopped getting the paper delivered to our home- However the following month the charge was automatically deducted from our account. After several phone calls I eventually hand wrote a letter and mailed it to the Republic- A month later we got a refund and an apology letter.  In November of 2010 I joined Coupon$ense and through their AZ Republic vendor started a new subscription that included 3 Sunday papers each week (plus a W, F and Sat paper) Since I only needed the coupons in the Sunday paper (and they are supposedly gtd to be in only home delivery papers and not those on the rack) I felt trapped into this excessive subscription. The waste eventually got to me and I  left the Coupon$ense program-(another review to come shortly!) I was told by Coupon$ense that I had to cancel my Republic subscription personally separately (even though they were the ones that set it up and never gave me an account number) -Regardless of the fact that I had an email from the Republic with my subscription information (minus an account number) when I called to cancel, my account could not be located.  Finally after 3 different customer service reps-someone was able to locate my account and cancel it.  The next day I got an email confirming that the cancellation had been processed and we stopped getting papers.  2 days later the monthly subscription fee was automatically deducted from my bank account  See the pattern here?  My advise- skip the home delivery and take a jog down to QT on Sunday mornings to get those bright colored comics and just check to be sure the paper you pick up as a stack of coupons in it. It will save lots of money and hassle.

3/13/2015 -First trip to this cozy theater tucked away behind all of the restaurants at Gilbert Town Square.Saw the new Disney movie that just opened yesterday Cinderella and what an enjoyable lovely movie going experience we had!  A- got to pick our seats ahead of time so no stressing about running in there B- reclined in plush recliners to various positions that had plenty of arm room on both sides C- had NO one block us at all from any angle(every aisle is a "at the bar aisle"- D didn't even need to shuffle if someone had to leave the aisle for a break E- no stinky feet propped on my head from behind F- the areas in general seemed less crowded and far fewer people to have to deal with (as if it is still a hidden gem) G- the outside had that "old time Cinema feel complete with an actual "marquee" which I liked- For our party of 3 It was $11.33 per ticket--"regular movie" price is $8.75 at the competitor down on Germann (if bought ahead of time on their website) so there is a premium on this luxury- and concessions is even higher then other already overpriced movie concessions ($5.75 for a bottle of water) - the lobby areas was smaller but again les people so that evened out- the bathrooms were dated but if that was due to the upgrades in the actual theaters then I am fine with a boring bathroom personally- I think on a date night or out with a group of friends I would have no problem paying that extra (in fact I would always opt for this) for the stress free enjoyment of hitting a 7:30pm movie on a Friday night for its opening weekend.  The movie was also lovely.

Our property management team reached out to Gabriel's to inquire if they invoice for jobs in order to work with several of our  rental properties. The receptionist said yes and provided me with an email to forward a work order for review. Prior to sending the work order I sent the company our vendor expectations to review so we would all be on the same page.  I then forwarded the workorder-  Gabriel's made an appointment with our tenant (did not inform me about it) and when I inquired to be sure they had received all of our information and the work order I was informed that they would not agree to our expectations at this time and would be cancelling the appointment that they already set with the tenant.  When asked specifically what was unagreeable I was told " we can not always get things done in 5 days" they also balked at the idea of not being given approval while on site.  When dealing with appliance repairs- you are talking about sometimes hundreds of dollars- if not thousands depending on if it requires replacement. Our team needs to get approval from owners to spend that kind of money- this is why we need estimates provided and we can not always give approval while the vendor is on site for the first visit.  Our 5 day expectation  simply means that we want the tenants to be contacted within 5 days of their receipt of the workorder (something I would have been happy to explain had Gabriel's asked for clarification)   We will continue to search for a reliable and dependable appliance repair company to service the properties we manage in the West Valley.

After being married for 14 years and together for 17 years and dealing with me begging him to go to a haunted house with me every October my hubby finally relented and surprised me with a trip here for date night.    Having been a haunted house performer in my younger days down in Tucson I always have loved a good old fashioned jumpy, psychologically freaky, somewhat disorienting haunted house experience.  I was a bit worried that with the way horror movies have evolved and special effects have advanced that this was going to be more gory and horrifying than I could handle- but it was PERFECT!  I see no one else has review this place for 2014 so I wanted to post this for anyone looking into going now.    Specifics:  Location -easily accessible and plenty of parking (parking cost us $5 cash only which I don't believe was listed on the website but I could be wrong)--its in a desert lot so it is dusty- go ahead and plan on wearing clothes that you don't mind being active in and skip the sandals/flip flops (yes we still wear flip flops in October in AZ so this is an important tip LOL)-- bust out your sneakers or other comfy close toed flat shoes - you will be grateful you did. Trust me since it is so dark no one is even noticing if your outfit looks weird with sneakers go for comfort and practicality.   Cost- after you pay the $5 for parking you enter the facility and there are ticket windows--the night we went the window furthest right was for people who had purchased tickets online in advance and one furthest left was for people who had a groupon and the middle was for people buying at the window.  The park has 4 Haunted Houses (others call them mazes) and in 2014 the cost was $23 for 2 or $28 for 4.  There was also the option to purchase a "speed pass" for $10 more which gives you a separate line to go in and cuts your wait time.---Note- if you plan this in advance enough you can save a few bucks and get the groupon which in 2014 was  $21 for 2 Houses and included the speed pass (so you save $12 going that route but you only get 2 houses... the $28 you get all 4 Houses and to me the wait times were nothing that would require a special "speed pass" to endure. We were there on the Friday one week before Halloween and we walked right into 1 house no wait, waited for 1 group ahead of us for another and waited maybe 20 minutes each for the other 2---we were there from 7:15ish until 10:15 and to be honest we enjoyed having the break to wait in line in between  I would opt for the 4 houses and no speed pass.  Experience- I am not going to give spoilers but will say that we took a peak at 1 yelpers review while we ate dinner before coming and we agree that Zombie Infirmary is the SCARIEST one of them all- so do what you wish with that info.    They are lined up in a half circle with Zombie Infirmary being the one to the north (on your left when you walk in) then goes clockwise to Gold Miner's Revenge, Horror High and then Clown Tower of Terror.  I mention this because we started at Zombie Infirmary not really realizing that's what it was- as the sign calls it "Castle"---there was nobody in line for that one (we were in at about 7:30pm) so thats the first one we went to.   Then we just followed along the circle and ended at Clown.  #1 tip for doing the actual houses- if they give you the option to go as just a pair DO THAT-- WAY scarier than going with a larger group..if you are attending with a larger group I suggest splitting up into no more than 4 if you can ---this is because the bigger the group the harder it is for anyone besides the 1st one or two people to benefit from some of the "startle scares"  We did Zombie and Clown as just the 2 of us and those were both the BEST experiences for us... Zombie being by far the most terrifying/disorienting and Clown was the best at startles and disorienting.  Gold Miner they didn't give the choice and we had to go with a group of 4 others (so 6 total) and some how we caught up to the group in front of us too quickly and then the group behind us was a ton of tweens that essentially ran through the thing and caught up to us so at one point we were a mob of like 15 people---similar thing happened in Horror High which really took a lot of the "4D" elements of them being able to touch us out of the fun since there were so many people all together we were all already touching each other....I'm sure thats not the case always but it was for our visit and not anything the crew can do about  how other guests interact so I don't fault the park at all.  Be prepared to take 10-15 minutes walking through each one maybe longer for Gold Miners Revenge as it is the longest one-  it also has some tricky footing to be aware of so there are times when you are forced to GO SLOW so you don't roll your ankle or slip down an incline/decline.  Have fun!!

We want to express our gratitude for store employee Corey for assisting us in finding a rare mini figure piece to allow our 12 year old son Tyler (who has autism and is very specific to his desires) to complete a minifigure with from the build your own minfig station.  Corey went out of his way to find us a piece that we have been searching for online only to find it way over priced by private sellers- we really appreciate his fortitude in making our day very successful (plus it was Mother's Day as well so seeing my kiddo happy really made my day even that much more special) Thank you Corey for a job well done!!

This was like a party in my mouth.  My mom used to make a traditional meat and potato pasty that we ate with ketchup but I had no clue these could be so versatile. The roasted garlic oven fries "chips" were amazing perfectly cooked. I had the meat and cheese and my friend had the cajun chicken so we split it and each got half of each kind. ..server made us and I was soooo glad he did! ! I loved them both equally. . The red wine gravy is AWESOME and the home made thousand island is the perfect tang. I was less impressed with the banoofee dessert thing we tried but we will be back for pasty again

JDT is our GO TO garage company for our property management team. Ever since the very first time I contacted Jason to add him as a vendor to our database I have had incredibly professional communication, prompt service, fair pricing and an overall fantastic working relationship.  We have utilized JDT for dozens of jobs across the valley and all of our tenants have always reported that the techs are efficient and courteous and on time.  I highly recommend them for any of your garage needs.

We took our boys to Shoe Carnival the weekend of July 20th  for back to school shoe shopping I have to admit it was a little overwhelming since all of the little kids shoes were totally picked over however the shoes floor attendant named Jake was very helpful. He measured the boys feet and found out we could actually move up to the adult sizes so were able to find shoes and still get he great buy one get one 50 percent off special. We walked out with a pair of Nikes and a pair of Vans for under 70 bucks total. If you have kids in size 5 to 7 don't plan on being able to find anything during the special buy one get one 50 percent off sales even if you are there three weeks before the back to school rush (I started this review on my phone and forgot to log in to post it back then)

While my son had an enjoyable time at the class he attended, I have had a less then enjoyable time interacting with Chef Kathy about signing up for additional classes.  The website is difficult to navigate, the monthly class schedule is hard to locate on the site and even harder to actually decipher and Chef Kathy is hasty & unprofessional in replies to email inquires asking for clarification.  A recent string of emails left a bad taste in my mouth and I blogged in detail about the experience on my personal blog.   I feel that Chef Kathy took her frustration with me (after pointing out a typo on the calendar that caused a large misunderstanding about which class was available and when) out on my children by not enrolling them in the class I requested.   I emailed requesting spots at 8:40am on Dec 8th after being told via email at 830pm on Dec 7th that there was space available in the Dec 23rd class I was inquiring about  Chef Kathy proceeded to wait 11 days before replying to my request- in which she then informed me that she had sold the class out and could not accommodate my kids.  If passes for classes had not already been pre-purchased I would never deal with this woman or this business again. But since the passes were a gift from my children's grandmother I feel obligated to use them.

I am happy to see Chef Kathy visiting Yelp and other non biased review sites to see what all of her customers are saying about her company (not just those hand picked to be on her own personal website.) I am, however disheartened to realize that instead of taking the comments to heart and using them to better her business she has opted to use Yelp as a sounding board to put down former unsatisfied customers like myself by way of name calling. Her copy pasted comments to those that had less than positive experiences with her company showcase the type of professionalism that she opts to exhibit. Her comments do nothing to address the actual concerns brought forth in the original reviews, but go miles in proving the very points made about her attitude and how she treats customers. Future customers are urged to strongly BEWARE

This business went out of business in October 2011-  A letter posted on their website http://www.youngchefsacademy.com/stores/index.php?id=266  (viewed on 11/28/11) explained their versions of why and also gives information about getting refunds for any groupons, membership tuition balances, BOGO and certificates.  Here is the information directly from the website copy and pasted:    Dear Customer:  We deeply regret to inform you that circumstances beyond our control have forced us to send out this notice. Despite our best efforts, Young Chefs Academy of Chandler's doors were closed by the Landlord without notice. What is even more discouraging and disheartening is the fact that the Landlord has refused to work with us to reopen them even though we were the longest standing tenant, we only had three months left on our lease, and we could have had the opportunity to move elsewhere. The Landlord also refused to renegotiate a more market appropriate rate even though they were advertising such rates. As a result of the Landlord's actions, we were forced out of business, and the Landlord kept approx. 95% of our property making it impossible to open elsewhere, so needless to say this has financially destroyed us.  As you can imagine, we are devastated along with our staff as we have thoroughly enjoyed working with all of the kids & their families over the past three years providing this excellent service to the community & would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those wonderful customers who emailed the same such sentiments to us.  You will all be missed as well.  Sadly, we have weathered the economic storms over the past few years with great plans for the future only to meet our demise in this fashion at the cold and heartless hands of corporate indifference.  For those inquiring about Groupon refunds, please contact Groupon Customer Support directly at (877) 788-7858.  For those inquiring about BOGO, Gift Certificates & Member Tuition refunds, the customer will need to file a dispute with their credit card provider indicating "services not rendered" & inform them we are out of business, and you will be reimbursed from the reserve account of our merchant service provider.  This is how we are handling all refunds aside from Groupon refunds (see above) since we are no longer in business.  We would like to thank all of our many customers for their loyal patronage, and your business over the past three years has been greatly appreciated.  We sincerely apologize for this tragic turn of events.  With best regards,  Young Chefs Academy of Chandler

Tonight was only our 2nd visit to Chompie's Deli and we are pretty solidly sold on the greatness.  Our family of 6 (nearly all native Arizonians) enjoyed trying some New York and traditionally Jewish foods.  The service was wonderfully attentive especially the manager Christopher who went above and beyond to take care of us when my husband's order arrived undercooked.  The helpings are enourmous- seriously you can eat all weekend on one entree- and there is so much to choose from it is hard to pick- especially the dessert options.  I personally had the Orignal Jewish Sliders with gravy and I LOVE LOVE that dish- the flavors and textures are all perfectly comfortable and delicious.    We will be back for sure!

I think yelp needs to make the Message notification section of the site much more noticeable.  I have logged in several unrelated reviews since I wrote this one and at no time did I notice the comments from Eli reaching out over 7 months ago trying to make this right.  In response to his inquiry and for public knowledge : Communication began in email beginning December 3rd 2012.  He sent a very professional and thorough bid on Dec 6th- Lead property manager left several voice mails to clarify his bid work (mostly about who he contracts for palms) and got no reply- We then emailed on the18th asking for return phone calls- then again on Dec 26th- I wrote my original review on Jan 9th and still at that point had not heard back from AMS.  Yes this was all during the holiday season, but work doesn't stop for us so we had to move on at that point and use a different vendor.  Ironically the vendor we chose was less then appealing and we are looking for a new contractor to handle our west valley portfolio.  I would love to give AMS another chance and provide even more stars to this review.

I popped in here after I dropped my dogs off at Paws Attraction in the same shopping center for their baths and wanted to get a pedicure before heading to Disneyland that weekend while I waited for my dogs.  The place was clean and prices were very affordable. I got the $20 pedicure and paid cash so it was actually $19 with the "cash discount"- it included the nail care, massage (which was a unique massage with some extensive slapping and pounding- that may not be everyone's cup of tea but it felt nice to me) there were hot stones as well if I recall correctly and then the nail polish- I skipped callus removal because I was going to Disneyland and wanted to have tough feet.  It was one of the best under $20 pedicure I have had and lasted nearly 45 minutes. I will likely be back.

Our property management team has pegged Dale and Clearly Clean Carpets as one of our preferred vendors for carpet cleaning services in the east valley.  We have sent Dale out to perform several property turn over cleaning jobs including one in which he made a former foreclosure which had seen better days rent ready with his thorough deep cleaning.  You can expect professional service, courteous scheduling and affordable carpet cleaning services from Dale and Clearly Clean Carpets.

Not sure it would be easy to find someone more UNPROFESSIONAL, RUDE or CONDESCENDING on the phone then the person that answered my call to inquire about a repair for a tenant in one of the properties we manage.  I hung up.

Ate here for the first time today. I love the decor but was very underwhelmed by the actual meal type food options.. This is more of a snack and shake place. The prices are very high and even with using coupons we got in the mail we spent $17 for 2 burgers, 1 soft drink 1 "mini" shake, 1 order of onion rings and 1 order of zucchini.  My husband used a $2 off combo coupon on his order and I used a free onion ring with any shake coupon  The Onion rings are enourmous..you get 4. They come with a tasty sauce which had I not had I would not have eaten the onion rings..The batter was bland and basically tasted like oil onions.. The zucchini was the same way. .. Fresh thick zucchini but bland batter.  The burgers were decent, husband did his pastrami style and really liked that.   We shared a chocolate almond joy shake. . It was supposed to be a mini but apparently they over made it and dropped the smaller cup into a large cup and filled it the rest of the way. . Unless that's how they make their shakes (cup inside a cup).. it was weird to eat half and then find another cup.  Melted very fast for a "thick" shake. . In fact was pretty liquid when we got it.  Prob won't go back.

Stopped in for a bite and enjoyed a very tasty Hawaiian pizza baked in a wood burning oven. Felt like of could have been priced higher as it was a nicer "fancy" pizza with great presentation but was only $7!! Husband also tried some wings that were oven baked crispy and tasty.   Will def be visiting again

Yelp limits you to 5001 CHARACTERS in your reviews--which simply is not enough for things like "experiences."  That said I have posted a full review here on our blog at https://gerouxcrew.wordpress.com/2014/12/29/our-experience-at-marvel-experience/  for all to see complete with pictures if you would like more details about my comments below  Disclaimer: It should be noted that I refrained from reading any reviews or watching any news stories about this event prior to our visit so I kept my own expectations as high as they should have been for the cost of the tickets.  Also, while some may say it is not fair to compare something like this to "Disneyland", I disagree.  Disney as the parent company who has "theme park" entertainment down to a science would never settle for the poorly executed design and management of this experience to exist.  No reason to re-invent the wheel- pool resources from the Disney parks gurus and fix the kinks.  Several of the activities inside the experience are actual activities AT Disneyland (in the Innoventions attraction in Tomorrowland) so there should be zero "kinks" with those, yet there are.  Cost: For our family of 4 (2 adults 2 teens) we paid $145 for the Marvel Experience plus an additional $10 for parking and shelled out another $20 for a souvenir photo.  So at $175 we are not talking about chump change.  Time: We had tickets for Sunday December 28th at 3pm- the web said the experience would last 90-120 minutes. We were there for 3.5 hours ( i.e. 210 minutes) from 2:45pm until 6:15pm.  Approximately 60 minutes of that was actual "experience" everything else was standing in line.  Would we do it again?: not likely- at least not at the cost that it was.  Again it was nearly $30 per person  Pros:  It's Marvel so if you like Marvel you will be able to find something to like about it.  Cons: 1-interestingly enough kids 6 and under were FREE- which blows my mind because there sure were a TON of them and they take up a TON of time on the activities that those of us that PAID to be there are now having to wait for.  Due to the structure of the activities I believe every person who enters should be a paying ticket holder that would make it fair. 2- parking was an additional $10 (if you ever go to anything at Talking Stick you KNOW you have to pay for parking, this just always sucks- but at $10 per event they need to PAVE that lot- the dirt is getting old) 3- poor crowd management (read full review for details) 4- low value high cost (see full review for details of what $30 per person gets you)

Delicious food, wonderful service, fun atmosphere, enjoyable entertainment. Our new favorite Chinese restaurant. Sherri the owner is genuinely one of the most upbeat and friendly restaurateurs and even graced the staged with her own lovely performance. Entire staff was very attentive, food and drinks are well prices and fresh. Will be back with friends. Highly recommend!
