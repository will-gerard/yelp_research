Enjoyed a excellent club sandwich and a unique side of jalape√±o and cheddar mash potato.

Stopped in for breakfast and couldn't decide between the corned beef hash or Denver omelette, went with the Dever and wasn't disappointed, food came out hot and fast, lots of ham which was good and a good portion of hash browns. They dropped off a pot of coffee with the meal so never needed to ask for a refill. Waitress was nice and attentive which made for a positive dining experience

There are a number of choices for Chinese takeout in Queen Creek/San Tan Valley but this is my family's go to place. It reminds my wife of a Chinese takeout place back in Wisconsin. I have never had any issues with the quality of service and all the food I have tried there has been good or excellent. My usual suspects are the Kung Pao chicken but the kids really enjoy the beef and broccoli.

I called and left a message for them and got a call back from Kevin within an hour, spoke with him about coming and giving me an estimate for expanding my back patio with additional pavers. We agreed to a day and time his company would come out to look over the project but they never showed up, this is the second company which has not bothered to show up.

I can honestly say that being a native of Chicago I give their deep dish pizza two thumbs up and after I sampled some my son's Italian beef sandwich these people know how to do Chicago food right.
