I've been a patient of Dr. Page for over 10 years. I live in North Scottsdale yet drive to Ahwatukee to be a patient at Arizona's Vision!  The staff is very friendly and it is comforting to know that the office is state of the art with the doctors keeping up on cutting edge technology. I highly recommend Arizona's Vision!

First time dining here. The menu is diversified but too pricey compared to other similar restaurants in the Scottsdale area. I asked for the music to be turned down twice and although they weren't busy, it never happened.   The food was fresh but very bland. Salad was plain and the dressing was non descript. I ordered their evening special-Osso Buco ($30.00 range) and although it was tender, the sauce tasted like gravy. The vegetables in the dish were way over cooked, appared mashed. The sauce can make or break this entree.  I was dining with a business associate and didn't feel comfortable complaining given the circumstance. We were heading to an event afterward and didn't have time to re-order with the service being pretty slow for 5pm on a Weds. night.  She ordered salmon off the menu, it looked good but overpriced at $24.95. There are far better/more upscale places that are superior.  I was disappointed overall and won't be back.

VERY overrated !  I read several reviews on Yelp and really was excited to take my friend here for dinner. What a disppointment!  The server showed up twice--once to TAKE our order, then the second time to ask if we wanted dessert and our bill.  This is not what you call SERVICE.  We ordered the combo lamb and chicken skewer.  The chicken was good but the lamb was extremely tough and full of fat.  Of course we couldn't send it back and address the problem since the server failed to follow up.  I ordered a martini straight up and it took over 45 minutes to receive it. When the bill came they charged me an UP charged since I asked for the normally included cranberry as a SPLASH on the side.  When i asked the server about this charge on the bill, she said that since the cranberry was presented with ICE they had to pour more liquor...I didn't ask for ice...just a splash that I could mix in. They normally include cranberry, chambord, pineapple, and more for the same inclusive price to this martini so this was not an upcharge which was justified.  Heads up to those thinking about coming here.... You can go to several restaurants that offer excellent chicken/beef/and quality lamb skewers that are better quality and much more reasonable. It's clear that The PR doesn't focus on this.  Suggestion, Offer more reasonable portions for less $$ and offer more attentive service. There's obviously a problem when 100% of the tables are taking food to go and paying top dollar for a meal that simply isn't worth it.

There is nothing more frustrating than being technically challenged!  Nick was recommended 3 years ago and has been my exclusive "go to" guy ever since.  He is extremely knowledgeable, patient, and thorough. Nick, thanks so much!

I've been looking for great mechanic for years. I have two cars and struggled to find a repair center who had the knowledge and expertise to work on my Corvette. Gearhead was recommended so I gave them a try. Joe, the owner, is extremely honest. His technicians did excellent work and only recommended what was necessary. Excellent service, care, and prices. I would only take my vehicles to Gearhead !

Chicken Marsala to die for!  As a fine diner who is not easily impressed, the Nook's signature dish was amazing :)  Although a little pricey as a stand-alone dish with no side, the quality and mouth watering Marsala sauce made it worth the drive from North Scottsdale. Will definitely be back as I know I will be craving it again...

Is there an option for 10 stars?  You can stop searching for a realtor now-- Just call Joe Pascale!  Finding a realtor who is knowledgeable and truly focused on their client is tough.  Joe is a seasoned professional, very personable, punctual, helpful and fun.  I wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone looking for their perfect home!
