Server was rude and gave us attitude.  Chandal was impatient and she made my family feel uncomfortable by her obvious physical remarks.  Food was okay

I work right across the street from Antonio's Salon & Barber Shop and have been coming to him for over a year and a half!  He is absolutely fantastic.  He knows exactly what I like and the style of haircut I am picturing.  He is very professional with his work, reasonable with his prices, and gives a specialized haircut exactly to the T!  I rate him 5 stars.

I drove from Scottsdale AZ to Las Vegas Nevada and when i arrived in Las Vegas i first blew a flat tire.  Luckily it was right next to the shop! They patched my tire in 5 minutes even though all their mechanics were already working on their projects.  They were very nice.  They even took the time to bring my car on the lift and check it out for free.  Couldnt ask for a better mechanic shop!

Facility top notch, coaches are very direct, motivating, technique oriented and the community and atmosphere is very welcoming.  I recommend this place to anyone who wants to be a better athlete.  This gym is inspirational and will broaden your health and lifestyle habits. Chad and Joel are the go to people for crossfit training.    Having been a member since the opening of the gym, it has been a wonderful experience meeting positive and active athletes.
