This place has the worst customer service ever, the front desk staff are a joke. I checked in 15 minutes before my appointment and a full 35 minutes later they called me up to ask for a copy of my insurance card, I am a returning customer and they already have that information on file. I asked when I might be actually see my doctor, and they told me that he had just checked in his 2 o'clock appointment that he was running a full hour behind. I asked why wouldn't you have informed me that when I checked in so that I could be prepared for a longer wait, in which the front desk receptionist became extremely pissy with me and told me she had 100 patients to check-in and that she was beyond busy and shortstaffed, and yet in the 35 minutes I sat there she literally checked checked-in one extra person besides me, and a place only has five people in the entire lobby between three doctors.  When I express my displeasure  instead of trying to empathize, she just rambled on a lot of nonsense and told me if I left the building I could not come back, again it's not that I don't understand doctors can get behind, but it was the absolute rudeness an absolute I don't give a crap attitude that was unbelievable to me.. I will be finding a new doctor to help me with my diabetes from now  on, you can't treat people like crap and expect people to stay loyal to your business, the doctors in the back room better start teaching their staff to treat patients kindly or they will be out of business soon !!!
