I don't really understand how anyone can rate this place lower than a 4. The food is amazing. I have tried multiple sandwiches and pastas, and the pizza is ridiculous. The people working are usually in a good mood and have a short conversation with me if they are not overly busy. I usually call ahead for pick up and its always a smooth process.  Extra info: The have Pepsi Products for fountain drinks and they have a fridge with a variety of drinks including Snapple, which is also amazing. Lastly, the cannolis are my favorite.

i have been coming to this place since high school. Everything I have had tastes really good. My favorites are the Chorizo breakfast burrito and any of the quesadillas. Most of the locations throughout the valley are good as well. I usually avoid the one in Tempe though.

Everyone I have dealt with here has been excellent. From the front desk, to the massage therapists. I have had a membership for almost 12 years now and I have not been disappointed. The pricing is extremely reasonable especially if you are a member. I normally go with a deeper massage but tried the hot stone once and if was super relaxing. Glad I joined. I would recommend this location to anyone.

I have played softball all over Phoenix, a few places in Vegas, and in Pittsburgh. I play league here quite often and don't really enjoy playing here that much.   First off, I know this is corporate mandated, but to pay the amount of money for league is insane unless you have a sponsor. For the price (slightly higher) than every city league, you only get one game a night, instead of 2. You have to sign up for two league which ends up costing over 1000 for an 8 week season. After you pay that for league, you then have to pay $3 dollars to get in every time even if you are playing. ($3 is softball prices, I don't know about soccer or baseball). The rules are also pretty ridiculous. You can lead off and you can't hit the ball anywhere near the pitcher without it being an automatic out. Home runs are fairly reasonable especially if you play in the higher divisions. I will say that they definitely try to keep the divisions fair.  Continuing with the price theme, food and drinks are pretty expensive. It isn't insanely high, but eating here definitely isn't worth the money. I usually go with a pretzel which is reasonable, or the two slices of pizza and drink combo.  Field conditions: The conditions tend to go up and down, mostly relating to how much little league is being played. The spikes/cleats from the baseball players really cut up the all dirt infields. There tends to be some humps or hills in certain spots. The outfields seem to be alright, I never really play the outfield so I can't really comment. I played at the BLD in Vegas and fell in love with those fields. I wish our BLD was built like theirs was. (Although it was for a huge tournament so they probably had them well prepped going into the weekend)  Staff: This is one of the high points of this place. All of the staff are usually in great moods and are super friendly. The bartenders are great and friends with a lot of the regular players out there.  I will say that I do enjoy playing USSSA tournaments at BLD Gilbert. Paying the $3 dollars to get in for the day isn't an issue for me like it is for league. Having the air conditioned buildings are nice to cool off when you are waiting in between games.  Overall, the facility is nice. The fields are definitely cool to play on if you never played here before. The replica fields are fun. They just need to focus on doing a better job with the condition of the fields. I would recommend you playing here if you haven't, especially for tournaments. But if you are not trying to spend a lot of money on league softball, this IS NOT the place for you.

I have been to this Starbucks quite a few times. The inside is super comfortable and the bathroom is super clean. I mainly use the Drivethru which is super convenient and out of the way of the parking lot. All of the people I have dealt with have been super friendly and the drinks have been tastey. I definitely recommend this to people in the area.

I walked in about 25 minutes before they closed and they were happy to stick around and give me a hair cut. I was actually thanked for coming in. Hair cut was great and I think it was only $16 which is a good price compared to others in the area. I definitely will be returning. If you are looking for a great haircut, definitely check this place out!

Went here for the first time and loved it. The server was super knowledgable and friendly. The atmosphere was great as well.   Finally, I tried two specialty rolls( the cheetah and the fire in the mouth roll) And my girlfriend got an order of chicken teriyaki and everything tasted great! Definitely quality and reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend to friends.

I used boyds blinds to do my window treatments which included a combination of things...shutters, some cell shades, and wood blinds... I went out and got other estimates to compare prices. He wasn't the lowest price, but I am super glad I went with my guy. I am very happy with the QUALITY and especially the service that i received for my money.... I believe that you get what you pay for.   Overall I would definitely recommend him to my friends and coworkers. He may not be the cheapest, but he certainly isn't going to be the most expensive by any means, I guarantee you will LOVE the final product.
