I think the ambiance is nice enough.  The background live music is nice.  I LOVED the Champs De Elysee sandwich.  I can't stop thinking about it.  I found the potato salad with the ginger just okay but I am not a huge ginger fan.  A friend ordered the turkey sandwich that has cranberries in it and liked it.  Another friend ordered the cheese platter and it looked just okay.  I think the one at House of Tricks is much better.

Okay, I like the fact that your meal comes with a drink (milk, coffee or tea) and salad or soup and bread and dessert.  Or if you want to skip the drink and dessert at lunch it is $1.50 off your bill.  I think the angel hair with mizithra cheese sauce is FABULOUS.  I also think the eggplant parmesean is sometimes FABULOUS and sometimes average.  It is hit or miss.  The macaroni and cheese is also very good.  The salad and bread, not so good.

Great museum.  Great location.  Easy parking.  Fantastic for kids.  Amazing homeschool classes.  I highly recommend getting a membership if you find a good deal.

Went with the family and it was a good time with good food.  I enjoyed trying something new to me.  The tamarindo drink was AMAZING.  We tried the yucca appetizer, the green corn tamale appetizer, the fried plantain with bean and sour cream appetizer.  Really enjoyed all of them.  Can't say I could pick a favorite.  My husband had the chicken and sour cream and my son had the carne asada.  They enjoyed their dinner but I thought the appetizers I ate looked better.

I wanted to hate this place.  There isn't that much parking.  It is packed with only a few big picnic tables to sit outside and eat.  It was to hot to eat outside, IMO which meant I had to take my sandwhich to go.  There were only 4 sandwiches and 3 salads to choose from.  One dessert they were sold out of.  The price was high- $8 for a sandwich with no sides.  However, once I took my first bite of the tomatoe, basil, mozzarella sandwich I was in HEAVEN.  The perfect amount of each ingredient.  They have perfected the sandwich!!  I have been craving it ever since.  I will stop by for lunch EVERYTIME I am in the area.  I will bring everyone I know to eat here!  Seriously!

Had lunch today with my husband.  There were only two vegetarian options on the menu (not counting appetizers).  It was a choice between a rocquefort salad and another salad.  I got the first.  It was very good.  Loved the cheese, the figs, the warm apples and the toasted hazelnuts.  I was still hungry when I finished it though.  Had wished I had gotten a brie appetizer.  Wished they served some bread with the meal.  Wished the soup of the day- Butternut Squash was vegetarian instead of made with chicken broth. So I was stuck ordering a dessert because I did not want to leave hungry.  Got the sour cream key lime pie.  OMG!!!  So good!  Was the highlight of lunch... such a treat.  My husband got the special of the day which was ahi tuna tacos and a mint iced tea.  He was highly impressed- said the tacos were better than the ones at Hula's Modern Tikki.  Bill was $53 after tax and an $8 tip.

Why do people eat here?  It was packed on a Thursday night.  We had to eat in the bar to avoid a 20 minute wait to be seated.  Everything on the menu is SOOO Expensive.  The only reason we stayed and ate is we had a $50 gift card.  Wanted to order something eat that we could share while having our cocktails.  The waitress could not recommend or guarantee anything that was gluten free.  So I just ate all the free bread and butter they brought and then we ordered dessert.  He got the ice cream sundae and I had a lemoncello raspberry cheesecake or something like that.  The waitress recommended it.  It wasn't very good at all.  I only ate a few bites because I didn't want to waste eating that many calories on something not so tasty.  With three cocktails (A mojito for me and 2 gin and tonics for him), the sundae and slice of cheesecake, with tip was $45).  I think that is quite a bit.  The best part was the free bread, no joke.  Service was pretty horrid as well.

I don't understand all the good reviews.  We went for lunch on Valentines day.  The waiter did not seem to really "know" the menu and he was a bit distracted and distant.  The ambiance was just okay...  We shared the caprese appetizer.  I have had much better at other places, even made at home with fresh mozzarella.  For lunch I had the pasta trio.  The raviolli I didn't care for.  The rigatony was decent and the gnocchi was decent.    For dessert we shared the spumoni.  Disgusting.  My husband liked it so I guess I am just not a fan of the stuff.  We drank waters and the bill was $68 after tip.  I won't be going back.

I think it is a bit pricey for a super casual family restaurant.  The kids meals are like $6 each!  Also, as a vegetarian that doesn't care much for pizza the choice was EXTREMELY limited.  I had a dinner salad and a cheese hoagie.  Would much rather eat somewhere else.

My husband and I went for breakfast.  We won't be back again.  It wasn't bad it just was nothing special.  It has been around forever, the waitress was efficient but no smiles.  The decor is very 70's and never updated.  The price is average.

Nothing else like it in AZ.  All of the rides are good.  Kids can spend the whole day here.  Love that on school vacations it is dead and there is no wait for any of the rides.  Got lucky last time and went on a day that it was sprinkling.  We had purchased the all day ride and golf wristband.  The rain policy is a coupon for 1/2 off your next visit.  We did the rides for about 5 hours.  Then we decided to ask for the coupons which they gladly offered as it was sprinkling.  Then we golfed one round and went home.  Great day.  Can't wait to go back on the next school break and use our coupons.

I had the vegetarian breakfast burrito.  It was very good.  The tortilla and the sauce that came with it was spot on.  I really like potato in my b/fast burritos though and it didn't have any.  Lucky for me we had ordered french fries that were delicious and so I opened my burrito and put some in.  Perfect solution.  My husband and son shared the 18 piece chicken wings.  They thought they were okay.  Not bad but not the best they ever had either.  My son thought they were a bit dry but my husband liked that they weren't fatty.  My son also didn't care for the peppery taste vs. the vinegarry taste he is used to.  One of my girls had the turkey sandwich.  It was a hot sandwich and a hit all around the table.  Another child had the grilled cheese and it was just what you would expect a grilled cheese to be.  The lemon flavored sweet iced tea was real good!  Cheap meal for a family.  I don't know that I recommend it when hot out because the air conditioning doesn't work so well.  It does have video games and a couple of them were free.  Not sure if they always are or if we just got lucky.  This is the type of place that you order at a window and then pick it up to go or sit down.  Very easy for families.  If you want to tip and are using a debit or credit card then you need to tell the guy before he charges the card or it is to late.

I do not understand what all the fuss is about!  My son chose to get take out from here for his 12th birthday.  I won't likely ever order food from here again.  He ordered the combination plate #6- Chicken Chow Mein, Chicken Fried rice, Sweet & Sour Chicken and one egg roll for $7.85.  He liked it.  The serving size was HUGE.  You could easily feed two people.    I also ordered vegetable egg fu yung.  I was told it is vegetarian.  At first I wasn't thrilled with it but each bite grew on me more.  I liked it.  However, all the food was so greasy and unhealthy that I wouldn't choose to eat it again.  We ordered egg rolls and my husband said this was his favorite thing.  We got the garlic chicken wings.  Hugs chicken wings not what I usually get.  However, they were unbelievably greasy.  We got the vegetable lo mein.  Very black peppery and not very many vegetables.  I didn't like it.  The last thing we ordered was the vegetable fried rice.  Boring.  The total bill was $31.  Enough food to feed 7 people at least.  We had tons of leftovers and no one is really wanting to eat them.

If I want a chain style sandwich I would opt for Cheba Hut.  This place is just okay.  Not much better than Subway in my opinion.  Nice that they slice the meat fresh.  I thought the sourdough bread was a bit hard and stale tasting.  The avocado was browning a bit.   No fresh brewed tea.  I thought the sandwhich was a bit pricey even with no drink, chips, salad, cookie, ect.  I don't intend to go back.

Um.... seriously?!?!?!  4 1/2 stars?!?!?!  I guess if you are a blue collar worker that has less than 30 minutes for lunch and you want to eat in a run down neighborhood bar atmosphere and over pay for sub par food than this is the place for you.  My husband and I just ate there.  He ordered the Chipotle Steak Sandwich, diet style.  That is no bread and a side salad instead.  It looked like something you would get in a mall food court.  The ONLY vegetarian option was a grilled cheese sandwich.  I got the fruit cup as a side.  It was a bit hard, a bit flavorless... cantaloupe.   I could have made a much better lunch at home for less than the $21 we paid to eat at South Bank Grill.  I can't believe I just ate at this place!!!

I'm so surprised by the high reviews of this place.  I live very close by and have been twice.  Both times I was less than impressed.  I was super excited when we moved it to have such a cool thing - a roadside fruit barn near by.  Both times I went the service was HORRIBLY slow.  The place felt hot and there were flies everywhere.  I found the quality of the product to be bad as well.

Yum!  Cute little restaurant with yummy food.  Waitress doesn't really speak English but that was so unimportant.  The service was good and the food was really good.  Great free chips and salsa.  My kids liked the cheese enchilada so much that I didn't even get a bite!  Great bean and cheese burrito.  The best chili relleno I have had in a long time.  The price was a tiny bit more than I was expecting but I will be back!

I got delivery today for my daughters sleepover birthday party.  I was impressed and so were the kids and adults.  I wanted to get a big variety so that each child could have something they enjoy.  We had: Beef with Broccoli - $7.50 (the large size was smaller than other items) Bean Curd Family Style (veggie) - $6/25 (large size smaller than others but pretty tasty) Fried Wonton (10) - $3.15  Cream Puff (10) - kids really liked - gone right away Cashew Chicken - $6.99 (large size smaller than others) Orange Chicken - $6.99 - seriously huge and the first thing to be eaten all gone Teriyaki Chicken - $6.99 - huge and very popular item Vegetable Fried Rice - $5.59 (large size smaller than others) Vegetable Egg Foo Young - $6.75 - huge and delicious.  kids weren't impressed but i was Vegetable Chop Suey - $6.55 (large size smaller than others) This wasn't my favorite item 2 Vegetable Chow Mein - $6.55 - huge and the kids loved it.  both big ones were gone fast Chicken Fried Rice - free for spending $25 with coupon on their website.  One little girl loved it.  Total bill was $82.97 to feed 13 kids and 4 adults with tons of leftovers in the fridge.  Great deal!  Took 45 minutes for delivery on a Saturday night at 4:30 PM.

I am surprised by the good reviews.  I went as a last minute lunch and got a veggie bagel sandwich with fruit and a pickle spear.  It was about $5.50 with tax and I left still hungry.  The bagel was just okay.  The fruit was very fresh and that was a plus.  I have had much better bagel sandwiches.  I miss Brueggers in Chandler.

I was craving Dairy Queen for quite awhile.  When I finally went I was wondering what I wanted it so badly for?  I ordered a grape freeze.  The icey slush mixed with soft serve vanilla.  It was was so mediocre.  I felt like I was wasting calories for the day.  If I want a treat I can think of such better/higher quality treats and ice cream.

We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table on a Friday night after 7pm.  It would have been a 30 minute wait for an outside table which would have been preferable to us.  Went with my son and husband.  I ordered a Mangorita and enjoyed it.  My husbands Pina Colada was also very tasty.  Husband got pork tacos and was happy with them.  Son got a teriyaki burger and loved it.  I had a Hula veggie burger and it was good but I was wishing I had ordered the Teriyaki one also.  I ordered the french fries with cheese and scallions on them.  At first they tasted good but then they started to taste fishy.  (The likely fry them in the same oil?)  Great place to bring the kids.  Service is good and the ambiance is fun.  The kids meals are a great size.  My two littlest ones could easily share one meal if we bring them next time.

I have not had better chinese food since moving to Arizona.  The restaurant was 3/4 full on a Tuesday night!!!  With many Asian people.  I thought in this "recession" that having a restaurant that packed was a pretty amazing thing.  The service was superb.  The food was overall yummy.  I did not enjoy the greasy wonton chips that are served for free before the meal.  My friend really like them though?!?!  The hot tea was good.  My veggie dish (something with bamboo shoots, mushrooms, green pepper, broccoli, ect.) and steamed rice was good.  I ate every single bite.  The free dessert (wontons filled with banana and others with plum maybe?) were yummy.  The total bill with tax and tip for 2 entrees and 1 soda was $24.  I left full and happy.

This place is always crowded.  Be prepared to wait for 5 - 10 minutes for a party of 3 even on a Monday night.  I like the warm rolls and honey butter that you get served right away.  The peanuts on the table are a perk for some also.  Really like the 21oz bone in rib eye.  The salad with blue cheese is also good.  Was not as much a fan of the Sirloin but I usually am not.

We went for hamburgers at lunch time on a Sunday.  The place was packed.  Every seat taken.  You order at the counter and then find a table and it is a small place.  We sat at the counter with the kids and watched the food being prepared as we waited.  1/2 the people there were eating breakfast and it looked GOOD.  The sausage gravy poured all over hashbrowns looked so appealing to me.  Talk about a hangover breakfast!!  My veggie burger with american cheese, 2 kinds of mild chili peppers, sauteed mushrooms and all the fixings was fabulous.  All except the mushrooms which were canned.  Yuck!  I won't order mushrooms there again.  Everyone else had regular cheeseburgers and were satisfied.    The french fries were so good.  We did not order milk shakes but will have to next time as they looks fantastic.  The price is very reasonable.  Try it!

My two stars is for the food and ordering process.  I still thing going to the restaurant to experience the organ and bring friends or visitors is a must.  They only accept cash or check and that is always inconvenient.  Very few places don't take debit cards and I contantly have to remind myself to go to the bank on our way to Organ Stop.  You wait in line to order your food and it bothers me that I can't get mushrooms on only 1/4 of the pizza.  Toppings are only done in 1/2.  After you pay for your food you wait in a new line to get your drinks.  Frustrating!!!  The pizza is not even worth eating, IMO.  The fried appetizers are decent- I like the zucchini and mushrooms but not so much the mozzarella sticks.  The salad bar is an option.  The beer and wine is CHEAP.  If you want ice cream after your meal that is a third line you wait in.

We had a really good experience overall last Sunday.  It did take a moments wait to be seated.  There was lipstick stains on one of the water glasses we were served.  My husband did pay $1 extra for gluten free bun, informed the waiter that he had a sensitivity and was brought battered and deep fried jalapenos on his burger.  We were not offered any discount for these errors.  But, the food was reasonably priced and delicious.  I had a $3 salad with onion straws and blue cheese.  It was the perfect size and I enjoyed each bite.  As a treat since I ordered a salad I tried a salted caramel milkshake.  It was to die for!!!  So delicious.  My husband enjoyed his burger even though he had to pick off the offensive battered jalapenos and couldn't finish all of his first serving of fries.  Our teen son LOVED his spicy ghost pepper something burger and ate a second helping of unlimited fries.  My daughter was happy with her kids meal corn dog, onion straws and milk.  I look forward to going back sometime in the near future.

Went here recently late (within an hour of closing) and felt like we were inconveniencing the staff by eating here.  The food was slow and dry.  I just feel like I overpaid for not very good food and service.  I think I'll stick to one of the fast food restaurants when I am in this area.

See, when I go to a bowling alley I expect loud and stinky and run down.  This location though had THE BEST SERVICE I have ever had at a bowling alley.  Likely the best service I have had anywhere in my life.  The man helping was kind, funny, accommodating, fast, ect.  I was really impressed.  The food was decent.  Was able to order kids meals for the kids and myself.  They didn't care.  Was small portion but tasty and really inexpensive.

This place has been around for quite a long time.  The food is delicious.  I highly recommend the beef bulkogi.  The rice and teriyaki sauce is also good as is the macaroni/potato salad.  The manapua are popular with my kids but they mostly eat the doughy outside and leave the pork chunks in the middle on their plate.  The prices are really good and I like that they have free water and lemons sitting out on the counter.  The only icky part is that the walls are really dirty.  You sit at a table and there is splattering of food and other debris on the wall right next to you.

Another restaurant that I can't figure out why people flock to it.  The food is downright bad.  My husband loves steak and gets sick if this restaurant is mentioned.  The sweet potatoe must have been cooked and then frozen and then thawed... it was so runny and icky.  How do you mess up a sweet potatoe?

My FAVORITE pizza place.  I am not a big fan of pizza yet I could eat here daily.  I prefer the white pizza with tomatoe slices but I will eat any vegetarian variety, including just cheese.  The eggplant sandwich is to die for and enough for two meals if you aren't a big eater.  I have to save room for the Ba Da Bing Chocolate cake.  The best cake I have ever had in my entire life.

I think this is the best fast mexican food in Chandler or the surrounding area.  The food quality is high and consistant.  The prices are downright CHEAP.  I really like the bean and cheese burritos and the chili relleno burritos.  The jalapenos and carrots are a must and I am thrilled that they started selling Tamarindo.

Went for my son's 15th birthday to enjoy lunch.  Sushi is his favorite.  This place is small and you have to go into the restaurant next door for the restroom.  The menu is fairly limited and expensive, in my opinion.  The service was average and the food was just okay.  I don't think we would bother to go back.

It drives me nuts how dirty this place is.  Hardly anyone in the restaurant yet every table is dirty and sticky.  I prefer to drive through.  The teriyaki burger on fresh made bun is delicious.  I love that they have fresh brewed iced tea and the largest size (bigger than McDonalds) is only 79 cents.  Kids like that they have strawberry fanta soda.  Play area.  Try a chocolate chip cookie.

I am quite a fan.  I have been going for maybe 13 years with my autistic son.  We have seen Dr. Carr and Dr. Bacon - both are wonderful.  I also have brought my daughters.  Most recently we had an emergency visit because my 7 year old daughter got a scratch on her eye and was in lots of pain.  I was told to bring her right over and Dr. Bacon got her in immediately.  They had no paperwork on her because it had been 6 years since she had an eye exam!  (Only ever did the check at one year old.)  There was no charge for the visit even though I was told on the phone that just the emergency consult would be $75!  How is that for amazing care?!  I highly recommend this office.

We were well taken care of from the moment we arrived at the restaurant.  I loved how each menu was painted by a local and unique.  I enjoyed having a fresh slice of peach in my bottled water.  They have small glasses the water is served in and each time your glass gets 1/2 full the waiter comes and fills it up.  It seems they made a dozen trips just for water between my husband and I.  Very amusing.  The chef prepared vegetarian items for me that weren't even on the menu.  So delicious!!  I did have the tart as an appetizer and loved how the textures and flavors worked together.  I could eat one everyday.  The balsamic ice was great on it. The palate cleanser really stood out to my husband and I- strawberry chipotle sorbet.  Sweet but burned your tounge.  Mmm.  We did not order dessert but were brought a frozen chocolate mouse cake and truffles anyway.  Both were very good.  When we returned to our room at the resort there was a box of chocolates waiting for us as well.  Our total came to $210 for two people with one alcoholic beverage each.

I love this restaurant.  I really enjoy the reverse happy hour from 10pm-12am after I see a movie.  The appetizers are 1/2 price and they have some really good drink specials- better if you are a lady.   l like sitting out of the patio and relaxing.  The sushi rolls are good.  So are the avocado eggrolls.  Before I was a vegetarian the only thing I would order was the macademia crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and a creamy soy sauce.

I just can't believe this restaurant is rated so poorly!  It is my FAVORITE and I consider myself picky.  I think they have great cocktails and chips and salsa.  I always order the same thing... chili relleno, 2 avocado enchiladas with cream sauce and papas.  Yum!  I could eat here once a week.

I really like this store.  The customer service is great.  I wish it weren't so expensive but I guess you get what you pay for.

I love the individual pizzas but the macaroni and cheese is beyond TO DIE FOR.  The best I have had in my life.

I like this restaurant.  Since it is so small I am a little intimidated to bring my small children though.  The food is good and if you sign up for their online club you get coupons fairly frequently.

I have had hit or miss experiences here.  Many good ones but the last one was so bad I will NEVER go back.  I ordered the crispy tofu with brocolli.  It had very little sauce, the tofu was so uncrispy and the brocolli was not cooked at all... not al dente but HARD.  Then within 20 minutes of leaving I was sick as could be.  When I complained about my food they took it back to the kitchen and I swear brought the exact same food back to me.

Love the stuff- wish it wasn't so darn expensive.  They also have a storytime for the kids.  I think that is neat.

Food is to spicy for me.  Plus I hate that I have to go in the store to pay for my food if I forgot cash.

This was good mexican food.  I enjoyed the salsa bar (mostly the hot carrots!!)  It is nice to be able to have a beer also at a counter service restaurant.  I ordered the chili relleno plate.  It was good but I think I will try something different next time.  The tortillas were really good and I think I would go there again just to get tortillas to go.  Yum!  Oh and I am a fan of aqua fresca and they had a delicious cantaloupe one.  mmmmmmm

We stayed for a weekend recently and had a fantastic trip.  The room was beautiful and the bed was seriously the most comfortable I have slept on in my entire life.  We enjoyed having a drink in the lobby bar with live music playing in the background.  We shared a cheese plate appetizer and was NOT impressed.  It was like 3 small slices of cheese for $15 and it wasn't even that great of cheese.  Skip that and stick with a drink.  We thought the conference rooms were nice.  The room service was outstanding.  The caprese salad was AWSOME.  I am still thinking about it.  For breakfast room service brought us the wrong omelet (a ham one instead of a mushroom one) we were promptly brought the correct omelet and ate both for free! :)  We loved laying by the pool in the little beds and having lunch and drinks brought to us poolside.  I recommend this hotel for ANYONE.

The first thing that turned me off is that this is a family italian restaurant with no kids menu!!  To feed my kids cost me $8 for a cheese pizza and $2 for a soda!!  CRAZY!  We went with a party of 8.  I ordered the eggplant parm with the fettucine riazzi.  Both dishes were so flavorless.  Very disappointed and I would NEVER go back.  I am surprised to read a couple reviews saying the food was salty because I had to add tons of salt and parmesean to even make mine edible tasting.  yuck!  seriously and I had been wanting to try this place for a long time.  I'm bummed.

I took my daughter on her 6th birthday to pick out a couple treats.  She chose a sugar cookie in the shape of an ice cream cone to eat at home with a glass of milk right after school.  Then she chose a chocolate cream pie to have as dessert with the family after dinner.  Both were yummy.  The chocolate cream pie has a layer of chocolate between the crust and the filling.  I enjoyed it and will go back again.  I believe the cookie was $2.99 and the pie was $13.99.

Just does nothing for me.  The place is packed so good luck getting a table or a comfy seat.  The bathroom is located outside the coffee shop, across the hall and is locked.  The staff is not overly friendly, a bit stand offish'.    I tried the iced caramel royale.  It was about $3.25 for a small and just wasn't very tasty.  Also got the veggie wrap with hummus.  The hummus was flavorless and the tortilla on the wrap a bit soggy.  I don't recommend it.

I also feel misled by the very high reviews of this restaurant.  The service was very good.  The waitress (older lady) was one of the friendliest Asian ladies I have ever met.  (and my grandma is Japanese!!)  I have tried many, many of the area thai restaurants.  I LOVE thai food.  I ordered the eggplant dish with tofu.  The eggplant was okay, the sauce was yummy but there wasn't enough of it.  The tofu was DISGUSTING.  Seriously, I had to pick it out and not even eat it.  Ick!  I think Thai Elephant is the best still.

Needed a place to get my husbands suit jacket cleaned.  Found this place based on the yelp reviews and location.  The lady was quick, efficient and friendly at drop off.  The jacket would have been finished about 24 hours later but I waited a few days to pick it up.  The cost was $6.75... In and out.  I would be happy to come here again when I next need something dry cleaned.

9:45 on a Saturday morning and we had to wait 10/15 minutes for a table for 5.  When we were finally seated it was in a room by ourselves full of empty tables.  We had to wait for that?!  The hostess couldn't figure out how many adult menus we needed if we needed 3 kid menus.  Then she couldn't figure out how many silverware after that 2 adult menu and 3 kid menu debacle.    The service was so so slow.  I actually had to leave before the food arrived.  I will visit the Broadway/Priest or Baseline/I-10 location from now on.

Amazing service.  The owner will come in before the shop opens to groom my sketchy dog.  The owner will be patient and kind with my dog until she tries to bite her face off.  Then she will just muzzle her and finish as quickly as possible.  My dog always ends up with a shave, trim, wash and dry.  Once we have been able to put bows in her hair.  I pay $60 for my chow mix.  I don't think they care about vaccinations at all... never been asked.  I have to stay with the dog and groomer then entire time but maybe after enough visits I will be able to leave her?!  One can hope.

Not overly impressed.  What is the crispy flat bread they bring with dipping sauce before your meal called?  It was really good but they only brought 2 pieces for our table of 4.  Mango Lassi- Delicous Yogurt Salad- just okay Garlic Naan- really good Bangan Bharta- could be spelled wrong?  The eggplant- Worst I have ever had in any Indian Restaurant.  Also, I ordered my entree mild to medium.  Others at our table ordered very hot temperature.  I believe mine was the spicest of all.  Hate when they mess that up!!!

I pay almost $120 month in fees for our family of 5 but it is sooooo worth it.  Just the two hours per day of free childcare for my 3 kiddos is worth it.  I love the group fitness classes, the place is always clean and pretty well stocked.  The cafe has yummy smoothies and the pool is lush.  What else could you ask for in a gym?

Pretty good service though our waiter did forget to give us breadsticks.  I like that they give you a free sampling of wine before your dinner.  Love the Zuppa Tuscano soup and the salad.  The eggplant parm was just so so.

I won't go back.  The food wasn't bad but it was bland.  I had to keep adding salt to my pasta dish just to get flavor in it.  I didn't think the bread was that good- greasy and flavorless... the caprese salad was pretty but flavorless as well.  I had to add salt and vinegar.  The pasta dish they made me was rigatoni, zucchini, eggplant, sun dried tomatoes and an asparagus cream sauce.  To me that sounds divine but the taste was just lacking.  The service was attentive but assuming and flat, no personality.  I do have to say that the atmosphere was more than I expceted for the location.

I really want to hate this place.  It is a chain restaurant and not that clean.  However, on Mother's Day when Rigatony's had a 2 hour wait this Red Robin had none.  Add to that the free onion straws just for asking, a delicious salted caramel milkshake and yummy $3 Wedge salad.  I actually love the place!

CHEAP Tepanyaki lunch.  My kids were thrilled by the show.  They could not do it gluten free except in the kitchen.  Would not be good for a vegetarian that doesn't want the food to mix on the table.  Would go again.  The place was almost empty though?!

I am going to stop here everytime I drive by it now.  We went for dinner but didn't eat much- I just got a side salad because the real reason we came is for the pie!!    I overheard our waitress telling another table they were almost out of pie.  This was before we even got our dinners.  I called her over and she confirmed.  They had one piece of chocolate cream, one piece of lemon meringue and one piece of banana cream.  I ordered all three pieces.  OH.  MY.  GOSH.  It was the best pie I ever tasted in my life.  I was with my husband and our three kids.  None of us could decide which piece was the best.  They were all that darn good.    YUMMY!!

Driving through Wickenburg we were hungry for breakfast and knew we didn't want Denny's but had no idea where to go.  My husband ended up randomly choosing this place.  We parked on the street and walked in.    The atmosphere was fun- all the cowboy and hick stuff hanging around.  Nice TV's hanging on the walls with the news on.  Fun books on the table to flip through while you wait.  The service was fantastic.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.  I ordered 1 pancake, a side of hashbrowns and my husband gave me his biscuit.  I had to much food more me.  The serving sizes are big.  Everything was tasty.  I will go back someday.

Had a very bizarre and disturbing experience with Alta Vista.  I would not go back or recommend them to anyone.  When I made the appointment over the phone the staff was not overly helpful or friendly.  When we arrived for our appointment the staff did not greet me or my dog or respond to our arrival in anyway.  Instead the three staff members at the front desk were bitching about other customers and the other staff.  They were in really grumpy moods... talking about walking out.  I had to ask them if they would like me to sign in or to fill out paperwork.  I was told when I made the appointment that I could expect the appointment to take 1/2 an hour (after I asked).  I sat with my dog in the waiting room for almost 1/2 an hour before a woman casually asked me if my dog had been weighed yet.  We weighed her and then I waited again for a long while.  Then we were moved into an exam room where I again waited.  The strange thing is there were no other patients the entire time!!  I was told twice that the vet and people helping me had to keep leaving the exam room to go back to a meeting!  I was given almost no information on the reason I had brought my dog in.  I decided to leave with no treatment.  There is more but I will save you the details.  Suffice to say it was just all around a bad experience and a huge waste of my time.

Went for lunch with the hubby yesterday and LOVED it.  Finally I have found a Mexian restaurant that I liked and can't wait to go back.  Food was amazingly yummy... I had spinach enchilada with pinto beans and zucchini.  I ate every last bite on my plate.  The free chips and salsa were the bomb also.  My hubby got shredded beef tacos with rice and beans.  He was a happy camper also.  Next time we will go for dinner and drink some of those $1.75 margaritas.  How can you beat that?!?!    Seems like a decent place to bring the kids also... inexpensive and the inside is along the lines of a Garcias.  When I was at the register paying the bill I saw some Quesapilla's being served.  OMG they looked so fabulous that I will be ordering that next time.

The food was not bad but the restaurant was just weird.  The employees were two pimply faced teenagers.  The food is on a counter staying heated in silver containers and then they put together what you order.  My kids got nachos.  It was chips with fake cheese sauce.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito, it was just okay.  The guacamole was in a plastic store bought container.    I won't go back.

This restaurant was recommended to me.  I just wasn't that impressed.  Went for lunch on Sunday.  The place was empty except for one other couple that came in as we were getting ready to leave.    The service was really bad.  We were ignored for about 5 minutes after coming in and sitting down.  Our drinks and food were all served promplty  but with no smile or friendliness.  The menu was a list of specials hanging all over the walls.  The only vegetarian option was Green Curry so I ordered that.  The soup came out first and had brown curly noodles in it as well as chunks of small brown pieces of chicken.  Two of my kids liked it but I couldn't try it.  Lunch was served with fried rice instead of white or brown and I wasn't a fan of that.  The egg roll also had meat so I couldn't try that.  My girls shared the chicken teriyaki and were not impressed.  The fried pieces of wonton were the most popular part of the meal.  My son had the red beef curry and enjoyed it.  So did my husband.  I won't be back.

I have had really good experiences with this place.  The wait on a weeknight for the patio is INSANE.  The drinks are good (Mojitos!!) and I really love the Avocado Torta.  I think eating outside is a must though.  The live music is fun as well!

Yuck!  I swear I used to love the grilled cheese sandwhich and tater tots.  The food has just been disgusting the last 3 times I went.  I will NOT be going back.  The grilled cheese has hardly any cheese in it.  Texas toast with a butter smearing amount of cheese between the two slices.  The tater tots taste cold and stale like they have been sitting around for hours.  Ick.

My husband and I went here for a date night on 6/28/08 and it met all my expectations by far.  The food was to die for.  We both can't wait to go back.  I had some pomegranate green tea to drink that was really yummy.  Then we shared the Stetson Salad.  I am a vegetarian so they substituted the chicken or salmon for chunks of avocado.  Yummy!  This was just the best chopped salad every.  I don't think I can remember everything in it but the many different colors, shapes and textures were just thrilling.  It had dried corn, couscous, the avocado, lettuce.....and some pesto ranch or something like that...  For dinner I had the mushroom panfry.  I have to say that I am not a huge fan of mushrooms.  I like them but I don't love them.  That said the waitress said it was the best vegetarian option and the reviews on it were so good that I went ahead and got it.  It has like 14 different kinds of mushrooms all cooked together in a tomatoey sauce with a couple triangles of polenta to eat with it.  It was good.  I was impressed.  Now I don't think I would order it again but that is just because mushrooms aren't really my thing.  If they are your thing I bet you will drool all over this dish.  My husband had some expresso crusted filet mignon.  He said it was one of the best cuts of steak he had in his life.  He also really liked to flavor of the coffee on it.  I had to feed him a bite just so I could experience the cutting of it with the fork.  For dessert we had the goat cheese cheesecake.  I think that is what kind of cheese it was.  I loved the filling of the cheesecake but not so much the crust or the sprinkles on top.  They reminded me of uncooked sugar cookies.

I thought the best part was the ambiance outside by the waterfall.  The second best part was the pomegranate margarita.  The third best part was my portobello mushroom burger with chipotle mayonnaise.

I was looking for a restaurant in the area of Desert Ridge Marketplace for a nice date night while my children were at The Play Factory.  I picked this place based on the great Yelp reviews.  I was really disappointed!  They seated us in a thickly curtained in outdoor dining area with fans and air conditioning.  Even though it was 100* outside it was FREEZING in this dining area.  Another customer refused to be seated in there while we were having dinner.  I had goose bumps and asked twice to have the temp brought up a few degrees.  We ordered hot sake.. for two reasons... we like hot sake and to warm up a bit.  It tasted TERRIBLE.  I have never had a sake I didn't like.  It tasted watered down (almost 50/50) and overly fermented (rotten/moldy).  I informed the waiter and asked for a different cold sake.  He was very indifferent and kept saying no one else had complained about it.  (I didn't even see a single other table with a sake pitcher on their table.  For an appetizer I got the sauteed asparagus.  The asparagus was fresh but the flavor of the sauce (mostly soy sauce with what tasted like sesame oil and sesame seeds) was to strong and not that good.  Also they were unable to make it gluten free for my husband even though they had wheat free tamari.  (The wheat free tamari is one of the two reasons I am giving the restaurant 2 stars instead of 1).  I am a vegetarian and ordered the vegetable tempura roll, the cucumber roll and the veggie roll.  The cucumber roll was boring.  The veggie roll didn't taste fresh.  Even the chunks of avocado had brown spots on them.  The vegetable tempura roll was my favorite thing about the whole restaurant.  It was DELICIOUS.  With yam, onion and asparagus battered and placed in the middle of the rice and sea weed it was my favorite vegetarian sushi roll I think I have ever had.  My husband ordered yellowtail, salmon and spicy yellowtail roll.  He thought the fish quality was mediocre and that the slices were very thin compared to other valley restaurants.  We will not go back.  $51 bill and I was not satisfied at all.  In fact I felt a bit nauseous after leaving.

Ambiance was fun.  Tiny little main room and the bar dominates it.  The bartender was offering up free shots to the dining room of his own concoction (Scooby Snacks) and was just very social with the patrons, addressing them by first name.  The food was good.  I had a vegetables and tofu dish.  The tofu was disgusting.  However, the vegetables and sauce were delicious enough that I just picked out the tofu and that was good enough for me.  I had a beer and hot sake for the low price of $3.99.  My dinner with the food, alcohol, tax and tip was $16.  Not cheap but not that bad either.

Sat in the bar and ordered happy hour items.  Was thrilled that happy hour goes till 7pm on a Friday night!  Tried:  Spicy Garlic edamame- the flavor was good but they were shiny with grease.  That was odd  Gyoza - really good  Cucumber salad - it was long grated pieces of skin.  This was the worst thing we had.  Vegetable tempura - really yummy.  California Roll - my daughter thought it had a bit to much "krab" for her kid tastes.  Asparagus Tempura roll - good!  Philly roll w/ smoked salmon - really liked!  Sake bomber - $5.50 for large hot sake and large beer.  Awesome!

I am so glad that the Entertainment book had a coupon for this place.  A girlfriend of mine and I went for dinner and I just LOVED it.  I can not wait to go back.  We got a vegetarian sampler plate and the waiter (owner maybe?) threw in a free additional item on the sampler.  Everything was super yummy but I think my favorite was the collard greens.  Mmmmm.... I am craving it again.

I went for the first time and was very impressed.  Hands down better food/selection/quality than Subway.  I had the GRIEFO  (HEMP CREAM CHEESE / VEGGIES) Pepper Jack, hemp cream cheese, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce, black olives, onions, mushrooms, cucumbers, pickles, & tomatoes.  I added pepperchinis and took off the pickles.  It was very delicious and the 8 inch was the perfect size.  I didn't even touch the salt and vinegar chips I got to go with it.  The drink selection was fun- soda, two kids of fresh brewed tea and other unusual drinks at the self serve.  I had Tang.  Where do you find Tang at a restaurant or counter service place.  I will go back again and I will never bring the kiddos.  :)

I don't get it.  Then again as a vegetarian who likes to eat healthy for the most part there is really nothing on the menu for me.  Took the kids to get the chocolate brownie pie.  None of my three children really liked it.  Took about 15 minutes for them to make it also.

I went here on the recommendation of a friend.  I was not impressed.  The location/neighborhood is scary.  The restaurant is old and outdated inside.  The prices for the complete dinner was very reasonable.  The spice level on my meal ordered mild to medium came out HOT. (compared to others at my table and the way they ordered their dinner).  The naan was good when hot, not so good as it cooled down.  The mango lassi was delicious! The service was inattentive and lacking.  I won't go back.

I can't believe I have never reviewed this restaurant.  If you like middle eastern food then you are missing out if you have never eaten here, seriously.  We have been coming regularly for over 12 years.  One of our all time favorite restaurants.  We almost always bring company in town here.  The food is amazing.  The cost is so cheap!!  Always order the same thing... Vegetarian combonation plate.  Comes with 2 stuffed grape leaves, 2 falafil balls, babjanoush, tabouli and yogurt salad.  For the appetizer we always get Lebni and the plate is literaly licked clean.  I can't encourage you enough to order hand made pita bread with all of your items.  My husband and kids also love the chicken and beef schwarma as well as the chicken kabobs.  They always order the carbonated yogurt soda- yuck!!

I got lost finding this place for the first time.  It was a Saturday around 2pm and it was packed.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  Then after we got a table and ordered and got our huge glasses of iced tea we had to wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for our food.  We were so hungry we asked for crackers or bread or something to eat while we waited.  The waitress said she would bring hot bread and never did.  About an hour after arrival we finally got our food.    I REALLY wanted to hate this place.  The spaghetti calzone was SO SO YUMMY.  It was delicious and a week later I still can't stop thinking about it.  My kids each got a pizza and it was as first time I have seen them eat everything they ordered.  My husband got a gluten free pizza and thought it was just okay.  For how expensive it was he said he would stick to Barros.  But the spaghetti calzone.  Mmmmmm... I look forward to trying the pizza myself next time as well.

One of the easiest restaurants on Mill Avenue to park since they have a HUGE lot.  Arrived at around 4 PM on a Saturday and had to wait to be seated.  Older/historic building is huge but not that nice.  The service was the best part.  Our youngish male waiter was personable and just the right amount of service without being pushy.  The bread was amazing.  I enjoyed the rosemary and thought it was the tastiest part of our meal.  The rib eye steak I had was one of the worst steaks I have had.  The level of quality was less than I am used to.  Gotta say T-bones, Firebirds and even Texas Roadhouse are WAY better.  Even Longhorn is better.  The broccolini was cooked strangely and I didn't enjoy it - lack of flavor and in between al dente and cooked enough.  I would not go back.  If I wan't the area I will stick to their patio restaurant.  If I want steak I would go anywhere else.

You can't beat this place for sandwiches.  #1 at 12:30 PM on a Wednesday it is packed.  I saw maybe 70 people in the time I waited for my two sandwiches to go.  Prices are $4.99 for almost any sandwich you can image and $6.50 for huge salads!  I waited longer than at other places but everything was so fresh it wasn't a problem, I will plan ahead next time.  Tried the vegetarian sandwich with cream cheese, cucumbers, sprouts and avocado on a white sub roll.  YUM!!!!  So much fresh, ripe avocado.  My kids shared the turkey sandwich with bacon and avocado on sour dough.    Large drinks are only $1.50 and they have two choices for fresh brewed tea.  They gave my kids a free drink and apologized that they didn't have any free cookies to throw in when our order was ready!!!    We seriously can't wait to go back!

My husband and I went here on a date night not long ago.  I was craving wine and a cheese plate and a friend said House of Tricks has the best cheese plate she has ever had.  We had a little bit of difficulty finding the place.  I don't know how many times I have been down to Mill Ave in the 12 years I have lived in Arizona (100?) and never knew this great restaurant was tucked on a side street not far away.   The atmosphere at the restaurant is one of my favorite ever.  I love the outdoor seating with the grass, trees and fire pits.  I love the patio bar that is built around the trees growing through it.  I love the year round Christmas lights decorating the bar area.  My husband and I showed up without a reservation on a Friday night.  We were lucky to get the last table in the bar area to sit at.  The cheese plate lived up to my expectations- it was the most beautiful and best tasting cheese plate I have ever had.  The wine menu has an amazing selection of wines in every different price range.  We shared a bottle of Shiraz that ran us $29, I think.  We enjoyed the wine and cheese over a two hour period of conversation and relaxation.  I enjoyed it very much.  Now my husband laughed when the bill came and $50 later he was still starving.  We hit Filibertos on the way to pick the kids up from the babysitter so he could grab an adobado taco.  :)

This was by far the best meal I had all week.    CONS: *cash only - I HATE that.  Very inconvenient.  I never have cash. *the process of standing in line, yelling your order over and then waiting for your food to be cooked while still standing in line.  PROS: *$20 for 2 big burgers, fries and a pitcher of beer!!! *The most delicious Tijuana Torpedo burger ever *yummy fries *ice cold, frosted beer glasses  I can't wait to go back.  The topping bar did nothing for me but the chili and cheese on my burgers were plenty for taste and moisture.

This place is disgusting!!  The bun was dry and stale.  The veggie burger was yucky... I don't think I have ever had one I didn't like before.  The kids meals are miniscule.  The topping bar is so simple and plain.  The dips are not very good... cheese dip is YUCK!  Drink choices stink.  Cookies taste raw and boring.  Almost forgot to add that the two young kids didn't even care for the french fries because they are seasoned.  I thought they were a total waste of calories.  I can't believe the prices either... so not cheap or even worth what you pay for.

We are not members.  We visited this location on recommendation from a friend for the Parents Night Out program.  I found the entire experience to be very disorganized.  Making reservations on the phone took over 15 minutes and being put on hold several times.  When we arrived the night of it was hard to locate where we were suppossed to go.  When we found the correct location it was quite chaotic and disorganized.  My kids did have a nice time and I am confident they were treated well.  We won't be back though.

I loved my food here.  I got some veggie dish with tofu.  It came with steamed rice and a spring roll.  Delicious vegetarian food!  So hot and fresh and tasty.  I met a friend for dinner the first time and liked it so much I went back and ordered the same thing for lunch the next day.  I've been craving it ever since.  My suggestion would be to do takeout though.  The place seems to have no air conditioning and it was HOT.  They offer super cheap lunch meals.  My friend ordered Moo Goo Gai Pan and pork friend rice and hated it.  I have to say that the pork friend rice looked terrible but maybe that is because I don't eat pork?  Also the Moo Goo Gai Pan looked good but it was mostly white meat chicken and a bizillion mushrooms and my friend is not a fan of mushrooms in the least.

The service was so so so slow.  The cashier was friendly and helpful though.  Tried the pretzel bun cheeseburger.  Was so delicious!  Found out that you can order a pretzel bun on any sandwich for an additional 30 cents.  The frosty is good also!

This is the best grocery store ever!  I went there today to buy one thing- mini meatballs and left after spending $50.  There are just to many good things to buy.  I love the shepherd bread.  My whole family eats meat except me so it is great to buy all the marinated raw meats or the precooked meats.  I love all the cheese... cheap eggs... organic carrot juice, greek yogurt, the pizzas are awsome, the bruschetta sauce, creamy tomatoe soup is TO DIE FOR.... frozen vegetables in a balsamic butter sauce, the white corn is mmmmmm, edamame, shelled pomegranate seeds, nuts, wasabi peas, fruit leather, wines (some really good ones for just $3!!!), non alcoholic mojito, great teas, ect ect ect. I highly reccommend checking out traderjoesfan.com and reading the reviews of the food.  You'll find new things to try no matter how many times you have been there before, I promise.

We did not stay here... thank goodness!  It is crowded and hot and loud and a drunk group of travelers.  We came to visit the Vue bar.  The outside patio is small with very few tables.  However, if you can snag a table over looking the Freemont Street it is a great place for a $3.25 cocktail.  We did stay and play some penny slots.  Came out even and had fun for a few minutes.  Would not go out of my way in the least to visit this hotel OR casino.

I don't understand the hype??  The margarita was good.  The chips were good.  The salsa is so hot I can't even taste the "flavor".  My guacamole tostada was tasteless.  I had to dump salt on it even to eat the entire thing.  No flavor what-so-ever... I think hot is the only flavor they know.

The best things- *sitting outside on the strip *the gluten free bread/ menu and free olives *$5.50 drink special that was a Frangia *the chocolate mousse  The average things- *the frites *the croque monsuierre sandwich *the service *prices are pretty darn decent for the strip  The not so great things- *that having a reservation didn't get us a quality table.  Was given one right in the sun with no umbrella up and then moved to the far corner. *the macaroni and cheese was peppery and really not that good.  (You want a good mac & cheese then you MUST go to Nine Fine Irishmen at NYNY *minimal vegetarian options on the lunch menu

We are enjoying our stay at Mandalay Bay.  It is a bit confusing have the three hotels in one- Mandalay Bay, The Hotel and Four Seasons.  The staff have all been friendly and accomodating.  The gal at check in gave us a lovely room.  The view is a perfect straight on glance down the strip- room 18211.  Recommend!  The atmosphere and cliental are all nice.  We have eaten at three of the restaurants so far- Burger Bar (YUM!), Ri Ra Irish Pub (even better!), Verandah (crazy expensive but a beautiful atmosphere).

My family (including the kids!) enjoy this restaurant.  As a vegetarian there isn't much for me but I still enjoy a huge baked potatoe with a variety of different bbq sauces.  lol.  Everyone else sticks with ribs.

Went for lunch by myself when I was serving as a juror at the Municpal Court.  I loved it.  The service was great.  The food was outstanding.  The price was good.  The old house had a wonderful feeling.  I will return again for sure!    I had an eggplant parm sandwhich with a salad and highly recommend both!

Loved it!  Loved it so much on my first visit that I went back again only 4 days later to try it again!  Great happy hour.  Both times I had two margaritas - watermelon, citrus and I can't remember the other two.  Mmmm...  Ordered the black bean burger both times.  Love the bread and the layer of goat cheese.  Just delicious.  Both times was to full to even taste the salad that it comes with.  I look forward to going back a third time.

This has got to be one of the best breakfast restaurants around.  It has continued to serve delicious and out of the usual offerings for at least the last 15 years.  The service is spot on and it is cute.  (Even the bathroom is adorable.)  Most recently I had the eggs benedict with avocado and no meat.  YUM!  Seriously good.  Looking forward to going back sometime soon.

I really enjoyed a late lunch here with my husband.  We at on the comfy chairs by the bar, overlooking the hotel/casino.  My husband had the steak and fries.  He loved it and rated it a 10/10.  I had a cheese appetizer that was a soft mozzarella with olive oil and a splash of balsamic vinegar on the side.  It was perfect for a late lunch or snack.  It was $16 for the cheese and bread.  I asked for a bit more balsamic vinegar and was told that it costs $60 a bottle so could have extra regular balsamic vinegar.   Well, it WAS really good.

I was excited to try this after my friend told me what great reviews it had on yelp.  I was not overly impressed.  The employees were kind and helpful.  I ordered a falafel sandwhich, stuffed grape leaves and babaganouj.  I did not care for the falafel as it had a cinnamon type flavoring in it.  I have eaten lots of falafel and this is the only one I have ever had that I didn't really care for.  The stuffed grape leaves were edible but tasted exactly like the ones I get out of a jar from Trader Joes.  The babaganouj was DELICIOUS though.   If you go I highly recommend you order this eggplant dip.  Yum!

Small little place that was packed at lunchtime on a Saturday.  You walk through the double doors and proceed to the right to order your food.  They make your food in front of you (assemble it) and then you pay.  We had a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream and a side of beans with cheese and chips.  It was very good.  Love the tortillas and how soft and creamy the beans were.  Plenty of cheese is put on the tortilla before the beans and after the beans.  I will stop in here for food again.

The pizza was good.  However, $14 for a smallish pizza that they say serves two is high, I think.  And I can't imagine it serving two hungry adults unless you had an appetizer.  My husband and son shared a gluten free one with sausage and pepperoni.  They loved it.  The gluten free crust was more of a cracker than a crust- super thin and crunchy.  The sausage looked delicious.  Big chunks.  My girls and I shared a cheese pizza with goat cheese and roasted garlic.  It was really good but I kept thinking it was missing something.  Would have loved roasted pine nuts on it.  That is not an option on the menu.  I was not a fan of the gelato place connected.  I thought the portion sizes were really small for a gelato place and it was pricey for what you got.

I am a bit surprised by the previous reviews.  I had dinner here with a friend on a Sunday night and the restaurant was almost empty.  The waitress was not friendly or very good.  The chips and salsa was amazing but that was really the only good part of the meal.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito.  The beans were bland.  I had it deep fried.  It was but not to make it tasty.  It was dipped in oil just long enough to make it oily but not at all crispy.  It was then topped with a cream cheese sauce that was a bit spicy but mostly flavorless.  I'm glad we had an entertainment coupon for buy one get one and I would not go back.

Great service.  Nice ambiance.  So glad they have kids meals now.  Last time I was there (long time ago) they didn't.  So your child can eat for between $2.95 and $4.95, including a drink.  The happy hour is decent.  I had a coconut lemon drop (YUM) for $6, hubby had a large sake for $4.  Plus I shared the edamamme and tofu potstickers with my girls.  There are three small ones for $3.25 but they are GOOD.  One child had the lo mein with tofu, one had buhdda's feast with tofu.  The buhdda's feast was just steamed carrot, broccoli and sugar snap peas.  The rice and sauce (she got sweet & sour) was on the side.  My birthday boy ordered off the gluten free menu and had the mongolian beef.  He scarfed it down.  Hubby had gluten free spicy chicken.  It wasn't hot enough for him so he added more pepper sauce but he did enjoy it.  I had the vegetarian spicy eggplant.  It was DELICIOUS.  $7.95 and I couldn't even finish it.  For my son's birthday they brought him a free mini dessert.  He chose triple chocolate mousse.  Usually they are $2.25 each.  Total bill was $70.

The service was not great and a bit slow.  However, the food for than made up for it.  YUM!  I had a salad with jalapeno ranch and then the butternut squash ravioli.  It was so good that I can't wait to go back and get it again.  We were lucky enough to hear the waiter singing Happy Birthday in Italian while we were there and that was a treat.  Oh, I would skip the pineapple, chantilly cream cake we had for dessert.  I wasn't impressed.

Ate here just because I was going to a book signing at Changing Hands and needed to stay near by.  The food is a bit overpriced for what you get and the vegetarian choices are almost none.  I got a 4 cheese grilled cheese.  It was good but not what I would usually order for dinner.  It came with a choice of sides and I got fruit.  It was a little over ripe.   The mojito I had was yummy though.

Really excited to be at a "french" bakery in the area.  The service was very friendly.  The ambiance is simple but cute.  The huge macaroons look amazing - can't wait to come back and try them. (They are a bit pricey at $3.15 each but they are larger than other places.)   Ordered the Signature Sausage Turnover and Eggs.  The worst part of the meal was the eggs.  I ordered them over medium as I don't like any runny white but love the runny yoke.  They came out super over cooked and hard.  There was not a drop of yoke left to run.  The sausage turnover was really yummy but not what I had envisioned in my head.  It was a sausage gravy like you would have on a biscuits and gravy dish with mushrooms in it inside a puff pastry.  The Baked Tomato Provençale is a tomato with yummy thick layer of breadcrumbs on it.  Brought home a chocolate croissant for my daughter.  I had a little bite and it was yummy.  She wasn't as thrilled with it as I had hoped she would be.  I would like to try this place again!  Thumbs up!

We have been here at least a half dozen times.  I think the food is really good for a pizza buffet place.  I love the macaroni and cheese or the alfredo pasta.  The baked potato bar is delicious.  My kids like the soups.  The salad bar is good.  Everything is fresh and they have a nice assortment of toppings.  Since the last time I went they reduced some of the salad options that I liked- feta cheese, blue cheese crumbles, baby corn, ect.  The pizza choices are interesting and mostly good.  The beverage bar is above average as well.  I have to agree with a previous reviewer about the desserts... ick!  the kids like it though so I guess it is okay to save me the calories and fat of indulging in dessert.  :) I think the $7.99 for an adult lunch Monday- Thurs. or Friday and $5.99 for kids- 3 and under eat free is very reasonable.  The kids and I always eat our lunch while watching a movie in the theatre room.  We have never done bowling, rock wall, mini golfing or laser tag but we will some day.  The kids have stuck to the rides- mostly frog hopper, tea cups and mini roller coaster thing as well as the games.

Best fast food restaurant.  Great service.  Fresh food.  Love the grilled cheese with grilled and raw onions and minimal sauce.  The fries are great when they are hot.  Fresh brewed iced tea with fresh big chunks of lemon.  Mmmm.... I could eat here everyday.

Perhaps I just had an off experience with the food.  The restaurant was very crowded on a Friday night.  I got a curry that was mild.  It was very very very spicy.  I ended up eating two bowls of rice and a small amount of the curry.  Now my husband on the other hand ate my leftovers when I brought them home and loved it.  He likes really spicy food and couldn't believe what he was eating was Yupha's Mild.  I won't go again.  I love love love Papaya Thai.

This is my favorite theater.  Might have something to do with the fact that it is closest to home.    Parking is easy, staff are quick and friendly, never a wait for concession and theaters are never very crowded.   I like taking the kids to the Harkins summer movie program.  Great deal- 10 movies for $7 total.  Plus we always buy a t-shirt for $25 and have free popcorn all year.

I felt way under dressed in my jeans.  A very nice ambiance and I enjoyed our meal.  I had the filet mignon cobb salad and it was the perfect dinner.  The meat was so tender and the combination of additional ingredients was delicious.  (I did not have the bacon on it.)  The friends I enjoyed dinner with had: Ahi Salad (did not look as good as mine) Jumbalya (not my thing but looked pretty good) Prime Rib (had a very large bone) Roasted Chicken (didn't look good to me) Stacked Chicken Enchiladas (looked really good) carrots (good) broccoli (okay)  Had the bread pudding for dessert and it was amazing!!!  So good.  The brownie looked okay.  The service was pretty good.  Drink refills were slow and dessert took forever after we ordered it.  The waiter was very friendly though.

I'm weirded out by the bad reviews.  I took my kids for lunch.  The dining room is clean and nicely decorated.  The staff was very attentive.  The value is amazing.  For just over $5  you pick your entree and it comes with lo mein (looks simple but tastes wonderful), fried rice (ok) or white rice and a chicken egg roll.  My son had the volcano beef.  He really liked it.  My girls shared the honey chicken.  It looked fabulous and they really enjoyed it.  I had the vegetable deluxe.  Likely the best veggies, tofu and sauce I have ever had.  For dessert we all shared a huge mango smoothie that was less than $2.  Yum!  I look forward to going back.  So happy to have found a restaurant close to home that I like so much!

Just got back from having lunch here...  Been many times in the last year for lunch, take out, ect.  We will NOT be back!!!  Went for lunch... got my usual of kung pao tofu with white rice and veggie egg roll.  My husband ordered 2 pc. tuna nigiri, 2 pc. salmon nigiri, 2 pc. yellowtail nigiri.  The reason he ordered this is because walking in there was a big dry erase board above the sushi chef and it said, "Daily special  Nigiri 99 cent/ 1 pc.  Yellowtail $1.50/ 1 pc."  When we ordered we specified that he was getting the daily special and how many of each kind.    When we got the bill he was charged $16 for 6 pc of sushi when it should have been $7.  When I pointed out the mistake I was told that the white board special is happy hour specials.  I pointed out that no where on the white board did it specify that there was a time that the specials were good for.  I also pointed out that it was specified at the time of order that we were getting the daily special and pointed with my finger to the white board.  The woman still charged us the $16.  She got a $0 tip.  Well Sun Asian, you just lost a big local customer.  You will never see us again.

I like this mall.  I like the Wildflower Bread Co., See's Cany, Auntie Anne's, KB Toys, the pet store, Build A Bear, Apple Store, Nordstroms, Kiddie Kandids, ect ect.  I think they have a decent food court and I like that they offer a play area for the kids.    I enjoy the outside area with the water fountain and restaurants.

Liked the free chips.  This place is packed at lunch time with business men.  As a vegetarian there is little to eat as the refried beans are made with lard.  The veggie burrito then has spanish rice, lettuce, some salsa fresca, a bit of sour cream and a bit of cheese.  Blah.  The tortillas was DELICIOUS though!

Went for a work lunch and was impressed.  The ambiance is relaxing and simple.  The menu has some fun items.  My glass of D'Vine Pinot Grigio was tasty.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and everything looked yummy with the exception of the cheese plate.  It seemed meager and boring...  I ordered the bruschetta plate.  2 caprese ones, 2 brie and almond ones and 2 chipotle/avocado.  Delicious and the perfect amount of food for a lunch.  My favorite of the three flavors was the caprese.  I highly recommend.

I really really wanted to love this place.  I wanted a yummy BBQ place near home that I didn't have to wait in line forever (Little Miss).  We got take out of the thick sliced brisket plate with mashed potatoes, gravy, veggies and corn bread & the rib tips with sides of sw mac & cheese, blue cheese cole slaw and seasoned fries.  Thick sliced brisket - Icky.  I didn't care for it AT ALL.  Tough, flavorless and the gravy with mushrooms on it just wasn't what I was craving.  Mashed potatoes w/ gravy - okay  veggies - a really strange fake butter taste.  Didn't like.  corn bread - kinda mushy and weird  rib tips - my favorite part of the entire meal.  These were yummy.  sw mac & cheese - really spicy.  Strange and not very good.  Like Kraft with extra liquid and taco seasoning.  blue cheese cole slaw - my second favorite part of the meal.  This was really good.  seasoned fries - not my thing but the kids were happy with them.  I really can't imagine I will go back.  Inside of the resturant is cute and I would recommend dining there instead of pick up like we did.

This place is a 5 star if you go for dinner.  3 star or less if you go for lunch.  The vegetables at dinner time are so fresh and delicious.  My husband and son love the all you can eat steak.  The rolls are hot and delicious as is the banana pudding dessert.  Mmmmm..

When we arrived all of the tables were dirty and we had to wait for one to be wiped down.  The waitress was very friendly during the ordering process.  Then we waited and waited and waited and waited.  I finished my glass of iced tea and was cold so I decided to walk out to my car to get a sweatshirt.  I saw that our food order was sitting in the window.  Came back in and saw our food still sitting there in the window.  We waited and waited and waited.  I didn't even see an employee anywhere in the restaurant to bring the food to us.  By the time a lady (not our waitress) brought us the food the texture of the pancakes were horrible.  Our waitress was apologetic when she realized and she gave us 20% off our bill but it still took us over 30 minutes to get our food after ordering and that delayed our trip as well as the pancakes having to be remade because they were rubber by the time we finally got them.

Great experience!  My child woke in the middle of the night with a throat so sore she expressed difficulty breathing.  It was 1:30 AM.  I could wait until our primary care physician opens at 8 AM and hope they can squeeze her in early.  Then I have to suffer with her through the whole night and take all 3 children to the doctors if/when we can get in or I can take her to urgent care.  I did a quick search and found that this place is only 3 miles from home.  SCORE!  We drove right over - easy to find, easy to park.  Walked right in.  There was no other patients there.  The receptionist was friendly and efficient.  We did have to wait about 15 minutes after filling out our paperwork to be called back but when we did the nurse and doctor were friendly, helpful and respectful.  My child tested positive for strep and they offered a shot of antibiotics so that I wouldn't have to pay another fee at the pharmacy, give medicine for week and drive to Ahwatukee to pick up said prescription and the nearest 24 hour pharmacy.  We were in and out within an hour and half and then my child was happy to have been taken seriously and that she would soon feel better.  She went home and back to sleep.  Awesome!

I was highly impressed.  The store was well planned out and had a very nice selection of clothes.  We were specifically looking for girls size 8 shorts.  My daughter found 10 pairs she liked to try on.  We bought 5 of them, I believe.  My older daughter found a skirt with shorts underneath (had a matching neck tie).  I bought my son a reusable chore chart.  With the discounts I was offered the bill was around $15!  I liked this place better then Love Child.

I am becoming quite the Boba addict.  This place is good and quick.  I had the Taro milk slush with Boba, the diamond ice.  The boba is soft and chewy just like it should be.  I have decided that I should stick with the slush and not do milk ones as it doesn't sit right with my stomach.  The Diamond Ice wasn't really my thing- a shaved ice with strawberries, cantaloupe and pineapple.  Topped with sweetened condensed milk, red bean and mochi.  $4.50.  I'll stick with Boba drinks, thank you very much.  :)

I went with a group of women and we had a nice experience.  I ordered the salad rolls for an appetizer and was disappointed.  I didn't think they were very tasty at all and the dipping sauce was tasteless.  When my meal came I didn't get what I had ordered but was brought Pad Thai with tofu instead.  I didn't complain and very much enjoyed the Pad Thai.  I will go back again.

The food seems to have improved to me lately.  Had the Japanese Teriyaki noodles with veggies and tofu.  Couldn't finish it all and it was yummy.  Thrilled that they have a gluten free menu.  The kids menu is inexpensive and good portions.  Next time my two youngest will share.  My kids were in love with the soda dispenser.    Top all that off with free wi-fi from paradise bakery next door and   We'll be back!

I will try this place one more time before giving up on it.  I would never in a million years eat inside the restaurant.  It is so loud with all the tv's playing many different sports and all the patrons.    I got 2 dozen traditional hot wings to go.  When I ordered them I was informed that they are VERY HOT and I may want to go with medium.  Since they were for my husband and some friends who enjoy very hot food I got them.  When I picked them up the staff was very apathetic, bordering on rude.  The wings were very very very hot.  Los Dos Molinos doesn't hold a chance against the spice level of these wings.  All three adults and 2 kids eating them at tears, red faces, starting eating bread afterward and put ice packs on their lips!  Next time I will order the medium heat wings to go.

Very nice service.  Very family friendly restaurant.  We went after church on a Sunday.   Lots and lots of choices on the menu.   Lots of Asian people eating here- good sign right?!  My kids had chicken noodle soup, Kung Pao Chicken and lo mein noodles.  They loved all of it.  I think the lo mein was the biggest hit with them.  My mixed vegetables were somewhat bland but fresh and edible.

Kind of a pain to get to with the construction.  The guy taking the order seemed very inefficient and confused.  The Pilly Max cheesesteak was AMAZING.  I loved the bread and the gooey cheesey mushroomy steak on it.  I would order it next time with just cheese, mushroom and meat though as the other flavors got old as I was eating the huge thing.  Fresh brewed iced tea was a huge plus.  My kids shared a huge turkey and avocado sandwich.  They thought it was just okay, same with the fries.  We took it to go and it wasn't super fast but not to slow either.

Okay, I have only had boba in two places... here and at Republic Ramen but this place was far superior.  The boba is soft and the perfect texture.  The smoothies are yummy!  I liked every flavor I tried except the rainbow one... to sugary.. more for a little kid.  The almond milk tea was also really good.  This is now my new addiction.  Wish I had found this place years ago.

Took my 9 year old daughter here for a "date" on Sunday afternoon.  I was impressed.  It is not super fancy or sparkling clean but it was still decent.  We were seated at 2pm on the massage chairs for a pedicure with our feet soaking in hot water.  We were left there to chat and adjust the massage pressure/location for about 25 minutes.  Then we got our pedicures including a little massage and hot rocks.  My daughter even had big flowers painted on her toes.  I think the cost is very reasonable.  I was charged $17 for my daughter and $22 for myself.  The lady did a wonderful job on the trimming of my nails and cleaning them up.  I will be back.

The burgers are so dry and tasteless.  Even with the cheese and jalapenos it was barely edible.    Can't believe that for $1 you get a child's size drink!  The most expensive drink at any fast food chain!

This is the best Korean restaurant I have ever tried.  I didn't think I cared much for Korean food before eating here.  The server was a male college student and he was very helpful and attentive.  I ordered the tofu soup and really liked it.  I also thought the complimentary side dishes were fun and liked all but one or two of them.  I am glad I tried this place.

The first time I had one of thier gigantic pizza's I was in heaven.  It was so so so good.  Since then I have ordered pizza from them twice and it just hasn't been that good.  The last time the sauce on the cheese pizza was spicy and my kids wouldn't eat it.  I will not order from them again.

Really enjoyed the tamales and can't wait to go back.  The process/service is a bit odd.  There is a buffet steam table filled with whatever flavor tamales they have available for walk ins at the moment.  You choose from there what you want and how many.  I first tried to order a combo meal but it seemed like a hassle.  We ended up with a dozen tamales to go.  We had beef and corn  and chicken (the only three available).  My husband enjoyed the chicken.  I shared the beef and corn with my daughter and a friend.  We all really enjoyed them.  I think I liked the corn a bit more than beef but would still order both again.  We also got a large side of Mexican Rice and a bag of sliced limes with our order.  My friend has been back since to pick up a dozen!  I am also thrilled that they are open on Sunday.  There are so many restaurants in the area that are not.  One tamale is now $2.25 and a dozen was just over $18. I understand the prices went up 11/1/15 but still very reasonable price for tamales.

Yuck!  Tried Quizno's for the first time with my sister and three kids.  No one liked it.  It was as bad (if not worse) than Subway.  Who considers this stuff food?  Or a sandwich?

I was not a fan at all.  We went because kids eat free after 4pm.  They also have happy hour which made a combo hummus plate and a cocktail pretty reasonably priced.  For dinner I ordered what the waitress recommended... the spanikopita with roasted potatoes and sauteed vegetables.  The spanikopita was okay.  It wasn't bad but I wouldn't go to the restaurant and pay $10 for it again.  The roasted potatoes were terrible.  A weird mushy texture and a funky lemon flavor.  I hated the the perfectly fresh vegetables had dry italian seasoning sprinkled on top.  Ick!

I love this place!!  The sandwiches are awsome.  The french onion soup is the best I've had and it is vegetarian!!  Plus you get free frozen yogurt (that tastes like ice cream) with your meal!

I love the prices on produce I just wish it lasted a little longer once I got it home.  I also buy most of my vitamins here.  The sandwich counter is good and really inexpensive for what you get.  Don't forget to pick up a fresh fruit popsicle!

If you are in the area I much prefer Thai Elephant which is near by.  We did a taste test on the soup- Tom Yum and Tom Kha.  One night we ordered a bowl of each at Thai Elephant and the very next night we made the same order at Lemongrass Thai.  T.E won hands down.  Also, ordered what we thought was a vegetarian salad only to have to send it back and was told it had fish sauce on it.

I ordered a cheese pizza for take out.  It was ready sooner than I was quoted.  The employee was very helpful and friendly.  I almost fell over when he handed me my pizza box.  It is so HEAVY.  I have never had a pizza like that.  The cheese tastes fresh and like a high quality mozzarella.  I will order from here again.

Seriously!  I went out of my way to eat here?  My husband and I stayed in Las Vegas for 3 nights when he had a work conference.  We ate at lots of well rated restaurants-  Mon Ami Gabi, Red Square, Nine Fine Irishmen, Fleur, Verandah, and Ri Ra to name some.  Of all the restaurants this one was over the top pretentious FOR NO REASON.  During our mid week October stay we had reservations at several of the above mentioned restaurants.  It was unnecessary as there weren't many people in Las Vegas.  When we arrived at Mix without a reservation we were told they don't accept walk ins.  (Very rudely).  Then we went back to our hotel room in Mandalay Bay and called.  My husband was told that they were booked for the entire night.  I logged onto yelp and booked a table through Opentable.com that was 7 minutes later.  We walked right back.  The same hostess seated us.  Silly!!!!  The waiter was overly chatty and not very attentive to our needs (vegetarian, gluten free).  Even to the point not to tell me there was HAM in one of the breads they bring to the table.  My husband had a steak and asparagus.  I had the gnocchi.  Neither was anything special at all.  The best part of the experience was standing on the bar balcony after dinner.  We would not go back!

YUM!  Had a great late night dinner here.  It was LOUD.  I guess I had enough to drink prior that the noise and location of our tiny table right by the stage wasn't a problem.  Tuesday night and the place was packed.  Hubby had the blue cheese encrusted steak.  He didn't think it was as good as the steak he had earlier in the day at Fleur but he liked it none the less.  As a vegetarian I just at my husbands side dish- Mac & cheese for $6!!!  It was amazingly delicious!  I couldn't even finish the entire serving.  Would eat it every single day... way way way better than the Mac & Cheese from Mon Ami Gabi.  Thanks Nine Fine Irishmen!  Oh, and the service was spot on.  Friendly and efficient.

I was THRILLED by the happy hour prices and food.  Had the mojitos and the bruschetta dish.  Can't wait to go back and have it again.  Big chunks of fresh mozzarella, avocado and then a chopped up tomato, basil mixture.... served with pita chips.  YUMMY!  I have to say the service (young blonde girl working the bar area alone) SUCKED.  Good thing the food and drinks were so good.

Great service.  My son and I went for our first time and they bought us lemonade.  It was fresh and fantastic.  The service was wonderful... continually offering us refills.  My son got the hummus with gluten free pita and a gyros on GF pita.  The pita bread was so good I bought a pack to bring home.  For only $3.50 my husband and son have had 24 sandwiches.  12 slices of pita makes 24 pita pocket sandwiches!!  Great deal!  I ordered the vegetarian combination was enjoyed everything I ate.

I never wait to be seated.  I like the bar area, it has tables and benches, ect. and never has a wait.  You feel like you are sitting in the main part of the restaurant.  I really enjoyed the veggie burger I had last time we were there.  It was better than I've had at fancy restaurants.  The huge portions are fun because you always have enough for a meal the following day.

Not impressed.  The service was not even mediocre.  Do not like the concept in a sit down restaurant that I have to get up for salsa refills even when the chip refills are delivered to the table.  I did not care for the food.  Salsa was fine, radishes were fresh.  Did not like the mahi mahi platter, beans or tortillas.  I would not come back.  So many other dining options in the same parking lot.

My kids love this place.  My husband enjoyed his food as well.  As the only vegetarian in my family I was surpised by how many options I had on the menu.  The prices are unbeatable and the little dessert cups are the perfect size.  I thought the cheesecake one was the best.

Wasn't really my cup of tea.  Dark and dirty and falling apart feeling inside.  Went for happy hour which was only *okay*.  Tried the Mexican style nachos and they were fine... certainly nothing special.  Many of the food items sounded downright disgusting- like the Italian nachos.  I can't imagine going back.

Went on Friday night with a friend for dinner.  Ordered lemonade.  It was interesting but I wouldn't order it again.  Something about the rose water in it did not make it refreshing.  Then came out the babganouj and pita bread- just okay not nearly the best I've ever had.  It wasn't garlicky enough for my tastes.  Next was the lentil soup.  Oh.  My.  Gosh this was by far the best tasting soup I have had in my ENTIRE LIFE.  I will crave this constantly until I can return to have it again.  The thin little noodles and the yummy flavor in it.  yum!!  Next I had a falafel sandwich.  Was very good and well worth the less than $5 it cost.  I couldn't even finish it.  I highly recommend eating here but you must order lentil soup!!

3 1/2 years after my first review I have been to this restaurant 4 times now.  What I loved most on my first visit was the lentil soup.  Yeah, it just doesn't do the same thing for me anymore.  I won't be back.  Not because the vegetarian platter wasn't good (though it is quite a bit higher in price than Haji Baba which is my FAVORITE!!) it's that we had an entertainment coupon that they wouldn't accept.  We did not find this out until after we had eaten and were ready to pay for our "meals".  (Spent more on the meal then would have on another falafel sandwich if I didn't have the coupon.)  We were told that the Entertainment Coupon book printed their coupon again without permission and they have a sign on the door to let people know before they come in.  The door was propped open so the sign was unreadable.  If we had known the coupon would not have been accepted we would have eaten somewhere else.  Seriously!  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!

I went for breakfast with a couple friends on a Tuesday morning at about 9:30am.  The restaurant was busy but we were seated right away.  The service was superb and the food yummy.  A friend and I shared some dish with chiles and potatoes and eggs and avocado on top.  I am so glad we shared... plenty of food for two.  I love that bagels come with the breakfast.  I am a fan of bagels!!  Mmmmm...  Everything in the bakery is so pretty and delicious looking but I was to full to think about taking something to go.  Maybe next time.

I'm very picky when it comes to fast food Mexican.  It can be simple but it has to be good.  This place had very  matter of fact service.  The food was done in a quick time frame but it just wasn't that cheap or that good to bother going back to.  Ordered a bean and cheese burrito with potato added to it.  The tortilla was delicious.  It smelled and tasted fresh made.  However it was a bit burned.  Then the beans were very average with thick shreds of cheddar cheese.  The potatoes were gross in my opinion.  They were very big chunks of breakfast style potatoes with lots and lots of pepper.  I am not a fan of pepper.  Also ordered the 5 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole.  My children did not care for the "meat" in the middle.  The guacamole was a bit sour tasting.  I did like that the tacos were thickly rolled.  The outside was super crisp and the inside mushy.  That appealed to me....  We won't be back.

My first time having Afghani food and I am so glad we tried it.  I typically like Middle-Eastern food and this did not disappoint at all.  I am a vegetarian and the friend I dined with is not.  We both enjoyed our meals.  It was nice to get the free bread with three different dipping sauces as soon as we were seated as we were starving!  The sauces were all delicious.  As a meal I ordered Veggie Kourma Challow (green beans, carrots, turnips, and potatoes sauteed with onions, tomato, garlic, and cilantro).  I will order it again next time as well.  The restaurant was not very crowded for a Monday night.  There were only two other tables the entire time we dined so the service was very good.

First time going back in awhile obviously.  The service was TERRIBLE.  Very, very bad.  I ordered some eggplant dish and I didn't like it at all.  I usually love eggplant no matter how it is prepared.  I also ordered my dish mild and about burned my mouth off eating it.  Done with this place.

Totally bummed that when I ordered TOFU and VEGGIES it came out cooked in chicken broth.  I'm sure it is my fault and I should have specified that I was a vegetarian but I thought that was implied from the conversation I had with the waitress and by the order.  I don't know any meat eaters (though I am SURE they exist) that order tofu & veggies when they go out to dinner.  I sent my food back and left.  :(

Finally went again.  Service was faster but just okay.  The chips with three dips were just not that good.  Salsa was to much onion, cheese dip was bland and tasteless (almost seemed like cheese whiz) and guacamole had to much citrus and didn't taste right.  For chips that they fry there they weren't tasty at all.  The coconut mojito was okay.  Husband had the buffalo chicken sandwich on gluten free bread with corn.  The bread was so hard and dry! I could have pulled that together at home for nothing.  The buffalo sauce was all vinegar. The worst buffalo sauce I have ever had.  Truly disgusting.  The corn was the best part of the whole night.  The only item they got right.  Sitting outside was the best part of the night.  I'll stick to Vintage 95 when dining in this area.

Okay, I am thrilled with feeding my three kids lunch or dinner here.  Everyone can get what they want to eat from all the different stations.  Sometimes one of the kids wants a roasted chicken leg from the Smokehouse Grill for $1.50, sometimes someone wants sushi rolls from the Asian counter- spicy shrimp rolls, or avocado rolls, ect for between $5-$10, ect.  Then we go to the cold drinks and get fancy sodas for 50c or fancy honeydew white tea for $1.50, ect.  Then we all sit down at a table in the store or by the registers and eat.  Cheap meal, lots of choices and everyone is happy.

This is the real deal.  I HIGHLY recommend this place if you are in the mood for burgers, fries and milkshakes.  The owners are friendly.  The prices are unbeatable.  The quality is spot on.  I do not recommend the deep fried mushrooms or the grilled cheese sandwich.  However the other items I mentioned are phenomenal!  You must splurge on a milkshake... i love chocolate cherry.

I can't wait to go back.  I went to dinner with seven friends here on a Friday night.  We were seated in the VIP room.  I loved the room.  The sofa like walls and seating, the tv tray tables that move around on wheels, the giant window with curtains were you peek to the main dining room, the red chandelier.  Very fun!  The service was slow but that was just perfect for our group.  The waitress was very friendly and helpful.  I loved the teatini's!  I tried almost everyones and like almost every one.  I ordered 2 sour cherry teatinis.  I am craving them!!  Yum.  Yum.  Yum.  And happy hour is until 7pm and the drinks are only $4 each.  After that they are $7.50- still worth the price, IMO.  My food was delicious.  I had some greek pasta.  Spaghetti noodles with spinach, mushrooms, garlic, artichoke hearts, peppers and feta cheese.  The serving looked small but once I started eating was actually the perfect amount of food.  I didn't leave feeling stuffed or hungry... just right.  I want to try and make the dish at home- really yummy.  I will be back, SOON.

Not impressed AT ALL.  The guy working the counter and the owner lady making the frozen desserts were very nice and that is about the only positive about our experience.  I tried a sample of the strawberry birthday cake gelato.  YUCK!  I noticed they didn't have any plain vanilla soft serve ice cream.  At this point I decided not to even get anything for myself and here I was really looking forward to coming to this place.  One of my kids got the mint chocolate chip flavor.  I tried a bite and it was downright DISGUSTING.  It was airy and melted in texture with to large of chunks of chocolate chips, IMO.  If you want frozen yogurt I recommend Orange Leaf self serve frozen yogurt.  If you want gelato I recommend Angel Sweet.  If you want ice cream or soy ice cream or custard I recommend Sub Zero.  Don't bother with Chill.

I wasn't looking forward to eating at this place and was blown away.  The place was PACKED and the cashier said it is always that way.  I heard customers talking as if they eat here several times per week.  I ordered the vegetarian pita sandwich with a greek salad and drink.  The only negative was that the drink tasted funky.  At first I thought it was the fresh brewed tea that I got - maybe it was fresh or had some mold in it but I dumped it out and got diet Dr. Pepper and it had the same moldy taste.  Perhaps it was the ice?  Anyway it was way to much food for me so I will skip the salad (even though it was good!!) and just get the sandwich.  I wanted to go again last week but the kids got sick.  I will eat one this week.  YUM!!

Last time I went they had a new item that was just written on some paper by the register- Potatoe Tacos!!  Fried squares of potatoes (think breakfast) placed in a tortilla shell and then deep fried.  Topped with queso and lettuce.  Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  It was so delicious.  Nothing what so ever healthy about it but it tasted like salty, greasy heaven.

Seriously one of the best restaurants I have eaten at in awhile.  This place has been here forever.  Seems like an older husband and wife.  He takes the orders and rings it up at the counter.  He didn't have a cash register or a calculator... .did it all on paper with pencil.  The wife was in the background answering questions- very helpful with the gluten free and vegetarian questions.  Once our order was placed you could hear her beating eggs (for my chili relleno) and the butter melting for cooking.  The food was EXCELLENT.  My husband got a taco and a tamale.  Rice was better than Mexican rice usually is, IMO.  I want to order a dozen tamales for Christmas eve ($20) and they have blue corn that are vegetarian. MMMMM... I will be back!

I came with a group of nine girls to celebrate my birthday.  The restaurant was VERY loud at 7pm on a Saturday night.  It was almost impossible to talk with the person sitting across from you.  I ordered a mojito and it was the only disgusting mojito I have ever had in my life.  The pasta I had for dinner with some southwestern cream sauce was really good.  I actually enjoyed it.  Everyone elses food looked average to icky.  I think I got  lucky ordering the one tasty dish.  I don't think I would ever go back.

Had a great time here with a group of friends.  Loved the big round booth in the back- so comfy and great ambiance.  The happy hour drink specials are a great deal.  I highly recommend the $5 warm olives w/ toast appetizer.  Really good!  Tried both the truffle mushroom pizza ($12) and the garlic pizza ($10).  They were both good but the truffle mushroom was beyond good- highly recommend it!  The service was friendly and attentive as well.  All around winner.

I have to agree with the first review- How did I not know about this place?  How had I never been here before?  I have been there 4 times in the two weeks since I first discovered it.  Each time I have ordered the same meal...  one of the bowls.  They have two sizes- half bowl and full bowl.  I think the half bowl is plenty big enough for one person.  Once I ordered the full and I think it is the same amount of stuff on top and just more rice on the bottom, it wasn't worth the extra buck to me.  Once you pick which size bowl you want you pick your protein.  They have chicken, pork, tofu, veggie and others, I think.  I always order the tofu.  Whichever topping you pick it also has the other half of the bowl covered in veggies.  A combination of zuchinni, celery and broccoli.  Under the protein and veggies is your choice of rice- white, brown or rice and red beans or for 79c extra you could have noodles.  I always get brown rice and it is awsome tasting as well as healthy.  Then you pick your sauce which comes in a little cup on the side.  Choices are teriyaki- regular or spicy, jerk and something else.  I always get spicy, yummm...  A couple times I ordered the Rumbi fries and enjoyed them and the sauce they came with.  I highly recommend this counter service restaurant.

I ate here for the second time last night.  The $5 off $20 coupon in the Entertainment book sealed the deal.  The restaurant has changed the menu a bit and added 3 vegetarian options to the menu.  The lemon grass rice noodles that I previously mentioned along with a vegetarian curry and vegetarian fish dish.  The food was really yummy as was the iced Jasmine tea.

What is not to love about Costco?  Oh, maybe that the bathrooms are so far away, the lines to pay are usually long (they do move quickly though) or that the snack bar doesn't take debit cards.  Well, even with these little problems I still love shopping at Costco.  The products are good, the prices are good, the samples are fun and delish and the coupons are a bargain.  Love my Costco membership!

I loved this place.  Went on a Saturday with 9 friends.  We did the 11:30 tour.  I arrived 1 hour early just to make sure there would be enough room for the 10 of us on the tour we wanted.  The tour was infomative and fun.  The tour guide was hysterical.  I really enjoyed tasting all of the stuffed olives at the end of the tour.  I enjoyed eating lunch outside while listening to live music.  I enjoyed the free wine tasting they had.  For lunch I had a veggie antipasto plate.  I enjoyed it but next time will get a sandwich one of my friends was eating that looked so yummy.  I also had the lemonade and a Mexican Lime cupcake- very moist.  I really liked everything I had.  Shopping in the store was a good experience.  The only bad thing was I wanted to sample the olive oils but didn't like having to sample them straight.  I would have prefered bread or something to dip in the flavored oils.  Enjoyed sampling all of the tepenades as well.  I purchased some almond champagne (DELICIOUS- smells and tastes wonderful and I am not really an almond person), the paremesean romano stuffed olives (my favorite for sure!!) and a beeswax lip gloss.  My husband and I drank the champagne that night and ate all of the olives in two sittings.  Amazing!  I sent my sister there to buy me more stuff less than  week later.  We got the chili infused olive oil... so far I have drizzled it on pasta served with an alfredo sauce and cooked sauteed mixed fresh veggies in it.  So good!!  I can't wait to cook breakfast potatoes in it.  She also picked up the spicy green beans (YUM!  YUM!  YUM!), the almond stuffed olives and garlic stuffed olives as well as the peach champagne.  You can't go wrong with anything you eat or buy here!  And buying locally makes it feel all that much better.  Another hint... you can buy any bottle of wine they sell and pay a $5 corking fee and drink it with your lunch.

Was not impressed at all.  I like the little waterfall out front and wish they took advantage of it by having an outdoor patio around it.  99c margaritas for happy hour are great!  However paying almost $3 for a soda rounded out the pricing for beverages.  I liked the chips and salsa okay.  Was not a fan of the bean dip at all.  Ordered the guacamole.  Great amount and flavor was okay.  Didn't care for the big chunks of avocado that were stringy.  Can't imagine ever going back.

I was really excited to try this place but I just wasn't a fan.  First of all the bathroom had no soap for me to wash my hands.  The owner seemed really frazzled that he had just stocked the soap in there and maybe someone stole it.  He was helpful in getting some but it was still annoying.  Then the dish I ordered was not good at all.... Hot Pot.  I'm sure it was an issue of personal tastes vs. quality but the whole vegetarian fake fish grossed me out.  The prices are a bit high and I just won't be going back.  Oh, I also tried the lemonade (expensive and I couldn't see or taste any mint in it.)

Was very happy that the lunch specials even applied on weekends and holidays!   Tried: BEEF SUKIYAKI- so flavorful.  Loved it.  Was a little bizarre to my 12 year old daughter.  I would order again! SOY RAMEN - Delicious.  Better flavor and ingredient choices than our stand by Republic Ramen + Noodle in Tempe. CALIFORNIA ROLL - daughter loved them GYOZA DUMPLING - okay.  nothing special TOKYO STEAMED BUN/PORK BELLY - I didn't like it that much but the daughter did. I would really like to eat here again.  Wish it was closer to home.

I love this restaurant.  I love the sandwiches, soup, salads, desserts, lemonade... everything!!  I usually get the 1/2 sandwich with a cup of soup and a piece of peach pie and a lemonade.  Mmmmm...  I would eat here much more often if that meal didn't cost me $20.  I bring the kids and let them climb the trees, find pecans and run in the grass between the picnic tables.

My husband found this place and liked it so much he ate here 4 times in one week.  I ate there twice with him.  Chips and salsa are good.  Iced tea is not fresh brewed so the second time I just stuck with water.  First trip I ate the cheese enchiladas.  They were not that good but the refried beans were the best I have ever had.  YUM!  I like the way the cheese was under the beans so it stayed hot and melted.  Second trip I got a bean and cheese burrito.  The BEST!  I also got a side of guacamole that was really good!  My husband enjoys the carne asada tacos and the shrimp tacos.  He also likes the rice.  Stuff yourself and leave for less than $10 per person.

A friend and I had dinner here because there was a coupon in the entertainment book for it.  So glad we tried it.  I can't wait to go back.  I had some vegetarian thing with lots of fruits and vegetables in a buttery gravy sauce?  Very tasty.  The waitress let me know that the food tends to run a bit spicy.  I ordered mine mild to medium and will go with very mild next time.  I enjoy flavor but not burning my mouth.

Was nice to be able to sit out on the patio for dinner.  We arrived in time for happy hour so we tried the sweet potatoe appetizer.  I loved it and my friend didn't care that much for it.  She liked the dipping sauce but thought the potatoe had little flavor.    Got the tom kha soup and can't wait to have it again.  It was so so so good.  Also ordered the Pad Thai noodles with tofu and thought it was disgusting.  I sent it back and they took it off the bill.  Very eggy.  The only time I have had pad thai was at home when I made it.  Perhaps I just don't care for the restaurant variety of it.

If you have to eat fast food in the area then I guess this is the best place but I still don't recommend it.  The grilled cheese is barely edible.  I always look forward to the tator tots and they always disappoint- taste like they were cooked in old oil.  Yuck!  The only positive is the cherry limeade or cherry limeades.  Oh, and the kids like to add chocolate to Dr. Pepper.

I was so excited to try this place for Arizona Restaurant week and left disappointed.  I wouldn't go back.  Started with Roasted Eggplant & Heirloom Tomato Salad Cucumbers, Feta, Country Bread, Forum Cabernet Vinaigrette.  It was the best part of the evening.  Well, that and the glass of white wine.  For an additional $10 we tried the Mushroom Schiacciata Smoked Mozzarella, Tomato.  Basically a dry, over cooked, over peppered flat bread pizza.  I didn't really care for it at all but ate because I was hungry.  For dinner I had the Crespelle Zucchini2, Potato, Ricotta, Tomato Sauce.  It was actually disgusting.  I hated the texture and I hated the flavor.  Ick!  For dessert we tried both the noca Ho Ho - Chocolate Sponge Cake, Milk Chocolate, Hazelnut Mousse, Chocolate Glaze, Hazelnut Crunch, Fleur de Sel Caramel  and the Warm Doughnuts & Holes.  The donuts were good hot, as soon as they cooled it was a waste of calories.  The Ho Ho was actually fairly tasty.  They also brought some complimentary cotton candy (after we asked because every other table had it except us) that was bad.  How can cotton candy be bad?  Overall, with tip I believe the meal cost me $49 and it was not enjoyable.  Really bummed to have wasted a night out during restaurant week on this place.

I went in with really low expectations as this is a chain restaurant and left very happy.  The ambiance is higher scale then I expected and the service was very good.  They offer both low cost and higher end priced meals on the menu.  I went with the vegetarian plate including salad bar.  The salad bar was my favorite part.  I didn't care much for the cauliflower or mashed potato sides that I tried.

I always look forward to going out to dinner with my girlfriends here.  I really really really like the roasted sweet potatoe sandwhich, the vegetarian soups, the garlic lemon penne and the butternut squash ravioli.  I have tried the hummos plate and it was just so so.  I went for breakfast once and was impressed as well.

I can't believe I didn't review this restaurant the last time I went.  Love it!  Great ambiance, Great service, Great/Quality food and decent prices.  We shared the gluten free wild mushroom pizza and the spaghetti squash casserole.  The pizza was AMAZING.  I didn't even care that it was a gluten free crust.  I would have been happy to just share that for a light meal.  The casserole was recommended from the waiter.  It was okay.  Reminded me of eggplant parm without the eggplant... lol.  I enjoyed it but wouldn't order it again.

Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  I am so thrilled to have a self serve yogurt shop within driving distance of my house.  Now if it wasn't almost a 20 minute drive it would be even better.  I have already been 3 times in so many weeks.  I am a fan of tart frozen yogurt and got to try the original and mango tart.  Both were yummy.  My kids also have a great time picking and adding topping to the yogurt.  I had to limit them to 5 toppings each per visit because they got sick the first time after adding 20 or so!!!!

I went with a group of ten or so ladies to celebrate a friends birthday.  I was not impressed.  The ambiance is fine, the alcohol is fine, the food is TERRIBLE.  I went starving to the restaurant.  Big mistake.  Being a vegetarian the options were slim to none.  I had several appetizers to choose from but everyting was fried, greasy or with cream.  I understand it is a bar and they serve bar food but the variety of anything what-so-ever healthy was just not there.  I ended up getting corn bread.  It came in a skillet with whiskey butter.  The butter was interesting but the corn bread was just dry and tasteless.  I thought from reading the menu it had chilies and corn in it but I didn't see or taste anything like that.  I picked at it and then gave it to the other ladies at the table.  Now I am STARVING.  They offer not one single vegetarian item on the main menu.  NOTHING.  Not a grilled cheese, a veggie burger, NADA.  I thought that is weird.  Plenty of people I know these days don't eat meat.  Ah well, that left me with ordering a dessert to fill my tummy.  I asked the waitress what she recommended.  She said the bread pudding is fabulous and her favorite.  I thought it was terrible.  Really yucky.  No flavor and the scoop of vanilla ice cream on top had ice crystals in it.  It tasted worse than a store brand ice cream with freezer burn.  Ick.  I ate a couple bites and didn't finish that either.  I would never go to this bar/restaurant hungry again.  The food in the establishment will never pass these lips.

I went for breakfast during the week with a friend.  I was really looking forward to it because two different friends had highly recommended it.  The service was not very attentive even though the restaurant wasn't that busy.  My omelet and potatoes and pancakes were just mediocre.  I'm not sure I will venture back to this place.

The pizza didn't look that good.  The breadsticks were terrible.  The chopped salad was expensive and simple.  The drink selection stinks.  I hate when a place doesn't have fresh brewed iced tea.  That all said I will likely go back BECAUSE I noticed they have gluten free pizza and I will take my husband there to eat.  Also, it is a nice location and the kids can play outside in the grass after we eat.

Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  I went with a friend for dinner on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was fairly crowded.  She got some Thanksgiving Turkey pasty with stuffing, gravy and cranberry sauce on the side.  She said it was wonderful.  As a vegetarian there was a whole page of choices!!  I went with the Mock Rosemary Chicken one the waitress recommended.  I really liked it... mock chicken, brie cheese, mushrooms, potatoes, roasted red peppers and a sweet mustard sauce on the side.  It was so filling that I couldn't even finish it.  Which is a bit of a bummer because I wanted one of the delish sounding desserts so bad.  I must make a special trip some night soon just for dessert.  The atmosphere was trendy, fun and friendly.  The service was GREAT.  The food was cheap and as good as it gets.  What took me so long to finally try this place?  I can't wait to go back.

They had volley lite balls in stock both times I went to get one.  This isn't always the case with other sporting good stores!  Also, after about 5 weeks the ball lost a bit of air.  I tried pumping it and it held for a couple days.  Since there was no obvious puncture I brought it back to the store for possible return.  Even though returns are done within 4 weeks and by now it had been almost 6 weeks they made an exception and exchanged the ball!  Also, it had my daughters name written in permanent marker on it and they still took it back - usually you can't return when you write on them.  I thought the customer service was superb!

I had no idea when I booked my flight that I was booking on such a cheap and basic airline.  In Chicago O'Hare there was no signage on where my plane was, no information on the kiosk.  I had to ask other passengers if I was in the correct location.  I was shocked when I tried to board the plane and was told to get in a different line and pay $60 to carry on my small suitcase!!!!!  At least I was educated and could pay only $30 on the return flight by paying online before arriving at the airport.  The seats are so close together that even if the people next to you are average size you will be touching.  If you cross your knees you will be touching the seat in front of you.  The tray table is the size of a tablet.  The seats are really thin, uncomfortable and don't recline at all.  The stewardesses (especially on my return flight) seemed to hate their job and were unfriendly.    The only positive part of my experience would be the bloody mary in flight.  You get the can of Bloody Mary Mix, the airline size vodka and a package of dehydrated lime and a cup of ice.  Made myself 3 cups!

I am in love.  Thank you to the one coupon I found for $5 off $50 in the South Mountain newspaper.  Otherwise I'm not sure how long it would have taken me to find this place.  The service is fantastic and so is the product... (I'm told by my husband and kids as I am allergic to meat.)  I love supporting a local company with a solid product.  I was shown around and assisted in picking out meat for my family.  Beef was limited as they start with stock on Fridays and I made my first appearance on a Wednesday.  For $60 I bought- 2 one pound packages of hamburger a large beef roast cooked, sliced ham for sandwiches 2 kinds of bacon spicy Italian sausages 2 packages of pork chops- each with 3 3/4 inch thick ones for the kids and 1 1 inch think one for the husband.  So far everything I cooked has been very very well recieved.  Not sure I will buy pork or beef anywhere else now.

I had eaten here a couple times prior with a decent experience.  This last time it was horrible.  The place was dirty, the service was worse then ever.  They were decorating the tables with dirty used cans of some kind of energy drink.  I ordered iced tea to drink and I swear I got a swig of mold chunk.  I spit it out and then shoved bunches of altoids in my mouth.  I was almost crying as the taste in my mouth was so bad.  We promptly got up and left.  I will never ever return.  YUCK!

Love this place.  With it being less than a mile from Yogurtini and 9 cents an ounce cheaper it is the only yogurt place I go anymore.  I love the flavors- taro, coconut, bananas foster, pistachio, green tea, ghiradelli chocolate.  I love the toppings- lychee and pomegranate  I could seriously eat here everyday.

I went last night with 5 friends.  They all liked it.  I wasn't impressed AT ALL.  The people working were young and nice.  The food is just so simple and boring.  Something you could make at home just as easily.  I tried the confetti flat bread (not on the menu but recommended to me by the empolyees.).  A flat bread with salsa as the sauce and then different vegetables- roasted red pepper, corn, sundried tomatoes and a few other things topped with mozzarella cheese and baked.  All the veggies tasted canned.  It was edible but for that and a Sobe drink I paid over $9.  I wouldn't go back.

Was going to Sugar Bowl (around the corner) for banana splits but wanted some real food also.  The food menu at Sugar Bowl is to simple/strange for me.  We decided to try this place since there is a B1G1 coupon in the entertainment book.  It seems like a family run business and the decor is a kinda cute fifties soda bar theme.  The bonus is that they offer breakfast all day (apple waffles, chocolate chip pancakes, ect.), Mexican (my husband loved his carnitas tacos. they were huge and looked tasty) as well as Hamburgers.  I had a veggie burger with cheese fries.  A little bit of everything for anyone.  :)

It is hard to give this place a 4 star review because the service was pretty crappy.  The ambiance is adorable and the cupcake was the best I ever had.  Thought the price of cake pops and Thrifty ice cream was high- $2.20 and $2.50 for a scoop, I believe.  The cupcake was way better than sprinkles though.

I found this place hard to find and figure out parking.  Once the three kdis and I got inside I was suprised by how small it was.  I was also suprised to find that it had almost as many toys as candy.  The prices were reasonable for a boutique style candy store.  My kids had a good time picking out treats.  The crazy glass bottle sodas were fun.  The one my son picked turned his tounge, teeth and lips neon blue.

They are in the process of changing the name to The Bath Workshop which bums me out a bit.  I really like the name Bath Junkie.  We had fun deciding what we wanted (all the products are quite expensive though.. think $12 for a 4 oz shower gel and $18 for a foaming bath pump).  Then we spent almost one hour smelling all the different scents (dirt!  yuck!) and then finding a combination we liked.  We ended up with a combination of rose, lemongrass and sweet rain.  After you decide your scents you get to decide if you want your product colored.  I chose hot pink!    I would recommend this place!

First off, I admit that I don't usually do pedicures.  I rather spend my money on something else- like food!  However, my sister was in town and wanted to take me and my 6 year old daughter to get pedicures for her birthday.  We wanted to all 3 get done at the same time with short notice and this place could accomodate us.  They have 7 massaging pedicure chairs in a row.  The wash, trim, massage and paint was just okay.  And for $25 per person, plus tip I thought that was expensive.  The service was ugh... they didn't speak English or interact with us... only with each other.

Nice atmosphere but no other customers on a Wednesday at lunch time.  Decent menu though a bit on the pricey side.  Wine was 2 for 1 at lunch... thought that was nice.  Great service.  Ordered the Vegetable Pasta and was looking forward to the zucchini and asparagus.  It was way to peppery yet bland.  Could have used more cheese also.  I wouldn't go back.

This place is awesome!  How did I not know it existed?  No one I have told about it has ever heard of it either.  Sit between the waterfalls and listen to the beautiful sound.  Fun to take pictures and feels so much cooler surrounded by all the water even in the middle of summer.  Had fun watching all the huge catfish.  Looking at the bizillions of shells in the dirt around the canal.  Kids got to learn about hydroelectricity.    A great adventure!

After an hour and a half at this museum you would have thought I was simply torturing my 6 and 8 year old girls.  I may have enjoyed it more if I were not with them.  Even with the audio starting when  you walk up to an exhibit they were bored.  Though they did enjoy replicating some of the dancing from other countries.  The hands on room was the only room they enjoyed but even that only lasted 1/2 an hour or so.    I thought the museum was expensive and I have to agree that the staff was not warm and fuzzy nor kid friendly.  I was disappointed because I had heard so many wonderful things about this place that I had been looking forward to going for a long time.  Oh well, back the the Science Center we go.

When I called in my delivery order the process was painless.  They delivered at the exact time I asked.  Ordered 2 large pepperoni pizzas and 2 large cheese pizzas.  My total was $47 and then a $5 tip.  I think that is pricey and I am just not a fan of the pizza.  The kids thought it was okay.  I would much prefer to go to Queens on Main St.

This would not be a place I recommend.  My son did have good luck with this office and treating his acne with accutane.  He was treated young and the acne has come back.  I made a follow up appointment with the office.  The lady on the phone couldn't tell me when my son was last seen/treated because they changed computer systems and those records were in the doctors office.  I assumed incorrectly that the information would be given to me at the appointment.  My son was not seen by Dr. Racette this time and the older last that saw him was super rushed.  Talked fast, didn't explain things and I left feeling like I had driven all the way to the office for nothing.  Hopefully if this course of treatment doesn't work I will see Dr. Racette on our follow up appointment.  Very disappointed!

I have been going to Dr. Glassman for 6 years, I think?  This office, staff and doctor are very down to earth and friendly.  Everyone makes you feel so welcome.  Appointments are always on time and efficient.    The fact that they have a lab in the office is also a huge plus!

I am just not a fan of much that I have tried at any of the Buffalo Wild Wings locations.  I guess the best would be some of the alcoholic beverages and the Desert Nachos.  Last weekend I visited the Chandler Mall location.  It feels very small and tight.  The entryway is a bit strange.  Service was very good.  Tried the deep fried pickles.  They were okay but I didn't care for the southwest ranch dipping sauce at all.  Very thick and unpleasant flavor.  Also tried the strawberry limeade.  It was sweet and just not good.  I love limeade and this didn't taste like limeade to me.  I hope I won't be back!

Enjoyed this place but be warned it is crazy expensive.  My sister had a $14 hot tea and I had a $9 fresh powerade type drink.  Both not very big for what you get.  It was yummy but you have to be in the mood to splurge.  Kids did not like the french toast which is much more like banana bread served with syrup.  They also weren't thrilled with the mac and cheese which is white and quite bland.  I absolutely loved my tacos with tofu and guacamole and roasted vegetables.  I will for sure order it again.  We had 2 adults and 3 kids for breakfast.  The total with tip was over $100.  Ambiance is fun and service was wonderful and friendly.

They have no happy hour!!  The iced tea had a strange flavor to me.  Pumpkin Curry was hard to rate.  I loved the yellow curry sauce.  The pieces of pumpkin were cut to small and not great.  The tofu pieces were cut small and funky and tasted blah.  My friend ordered the vegetables delight that the waitress was highly recommending.  My friend thought it was boring and was disappointed.  The service was TERRIBLE!  The waitress was watching TV and never even came to pick up the bill so we could pay.  Eventually I put my debit card away and left the cash we had... meant the waitress got almost no tip.  Hard review.  The curry was good.  I hope your overall experience is better than mine.  I would give this place another try.

Blech!  I thought the restaurant was sterile looking.  I felt like I was eating in a hospital cafeteria.  I asked for vegetarian soup.  I got a soup that tastes completely like fish broth.  I asked for it to be remade without the fish sauce.  I got a super hot soup when I had ordered medium.  I was again unable to eat it.  Ordered the green curry with tofu.  Flavorless with hard potatoes.    I will not eat here again.

I was so happy with this place when I went with friends for lunch last week.  The service was outstanding.  The price for the lunch specials is amazing.  The baked rigatony with broccolli was so delicious.  Was excited by the pick a pasta early bird dinner specials also.  And kids eat free on Monday.  Combine those two deals and it would be cheaper than eating at home.  Can't wait to go back!!

I have been twice now.  The thing that assaults me as soon as I walk in the door is the smell of baby poop.  I have no idea what causes the smell but it is very strong.  My children noticed and mentioned it to me the moment they walked through the doors also.  The sat at the table with their noses plugged.  My kids liked the Deep Fried Tofu for $3.50 and it was a good portion size.  8 large chunks of tofu.    I tried the Braised Noodle with Sesame Paste (vegetarian) for $4.  It was so plain with very little taste.  Tasted slightly like peanut sauce.  I had to cover it in srarachi to get it down because I was so hungry.  Kids liked the Beef with Fried Noodles for  $7.95.  With the tofu it was enough food for my 3 kids that I brought home leftovers of both the noodles and tofu.  I tried the Vegetables with Fried Noodles on my first trip for $7.25.  They were just okay.  Even though the noodles are being made right there and you can watch through the window the taste was very similar to Panda Express to me.  Had three of the smoothies- Watermelon, Papaya and Strawberrry- all with boba.  The boba was pretty good but the smoothies weren't great.  I prefer Boba House around the corner in the same shopping center.  I don't think I will be back.

I really liked this place.  The service is pleasant and the food is good.  We were not charged for the miso soup we ordered and were brought free edamame and then fruit for dessert.  The rolls (including the happy hour ones) are reasonably priced and yummy.  I also really enjoyed the vegetable tempura.  If I was very hungry one night I would like to try the all you can eat sushi.

The best candy store I have ever been to.  I can't wait to bring everyone that visits me to this store.  It is like sweet tooth heaven.  My five year old couldn't pick her chin up off the floor when we walked in the door.  My three kids and I spent $18 on our first trip and we could have easily spent way way way more than that.  YUM!

I believe of all the frozen yogurt shops that are popping up everywhere this one is my favorite.  To bad I used to live close and now have to drive so far to eat here.  I like that they offer waffle cones to serve your yogurt in.  My favorite flavor is Taro.  I try samples of the other flavors but tend to fill up with only that one.  I top it with a small amount of mochi and lots of popping boba balls.  Yum!  Even my kids can't get enough of the Lychee boba balls.  We will up and tend to spend $3 per yogurt.

I was reading the reviews on yelp and excited to try it out.  Was super happy when I saw the food van at Phoenix Public Market on a Saturday.  I got the vegetarian dog Igby style (BBQ sauce, slaw and blue cheese crumbles).  It is wrapped in the softest, warm, delicious flat bread.  Something in it was a bit to spicy for me - not sure if it was the BBQ sauce or the slaw that was spicy.  I also tried the vegetarian corn dog.  Basically hot pepper jack cheese dipped in corn meal batter and deep fried.  I didn't care for it much at all.  Either did my daughter.  (And we really like a similar thing from Hot Dog on a Stick at the mall).  I am super excited that they have veggie dogs and can't wait to try another combination.  YUM!

Had friends over and wanted something easy for dinner.  Was thinking to have pizza delivered so I yelped a local place that delivers.  Other than the chains- Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, Hungry Howies and Dominoes this restaurant is what I found.  I would way rather support local, family business so I gave them a call.  I asked the girl who answered if they deliver.  The response was, "I think so but the delivery person is not here yet.  I think they come in at 5:30pm".  I asked if she wanted my phone number so she could call me back and let me know if they would for sure have delivery tonight.  She said she would call me back at 5:30 and let me know.  (This was at 5:05pm and I was STARVING.)  I asked her if she could phone the delivery person and then phone me right back otherwise I would order from somewhere else.  She told me that the delivery person was also one of the owners but she didn't know her cell phone number.  Okay, I left my phone number but with very low hope.  I was going to wait 5 minutes and call Papa Johns.  I was surprised to get a call back within that 5 minutes that the delivery lady had arrived and she had to transfer my call to a waitress to take my order.  I order a large pizza with 1/2 cheese and 1/2 pepperoni ($13), an eggplant parm ($13) and a baked ziti ($10).  Then I ask if this is enough food for 8 kids and 2 adults.  I am put on hold and transferred to the cook.  The cook says the parm and ziti feed one person and the pizza is cut in 8 slices.  So I add on another 3 cheese pizza for $13.  There is another transfer back to the waitress to complete the order.  I am given the total... over $52.  I hang up and proceed to go about my evening.  The phone rings again.  They forgot to get my address for delivery.  I go about my business waiting the 30 minutes I am told it will take to deliver.  The phone rings again.  They want to know how I will pay.  I explain that I have exact change and will pay cash.  The deliver occurs about 1 hour after the order is made.  30 minutes later than expected.  The pizza's are small.  The pasta is small and we get a tiny box with a few small slices of dense bread.  The pizza is gross.  The crust has way to much seasoning (rosemary) and even the 8 kids don't finish 1 pizza.  The eggplant parm was the worst I have ever had.  Paid $60 with tip and I wish I had ordered Papa Johns after all.  Very sad!!

We didn't realize this would be such a long walk from the convention center in the 100* heat but it was worth it.  It was evening and the streets were pretty empty, even for a Saturday night.  When we arrived it was very cute with outdoor areas and the house is divided.  Walk to the left for the restaurant and to the right for the bar.  My husband and I went into the bar and sat at a table for 2.  We were to late for any kind of happy hour but their Saturday drinks special is a cherry vodka with lime drink for $3.  It wasn't bad and I enjoyed 3 of them.  My husband got the street tacos to eat and I had the pretzel bread with dips.  I enjoyed the queso much more than the alfredo.  The best part was the ambiance and I would like to go back some day.

I've been here twice now.  I would go again if a friend wanted to only because the location is perfect for before or after an ASU volleyball game.  The happy hour is decent.  $3 Vodka & Cranberry.  $3 garlic mushrooms.  I wouldn't pay more than that for either item.  I tried the $1.99 veggies with medium buffalo sauce and blue cheese.  Of course the veggie and blue cheese were fine but I didn't care for the medium flavored buffalo sauce.  I also had the soft pretzels with queso and garlic parm sauce.  The pretzels are small and hard and have no flavor.  The queso is icky and so is the garlic parm sauce.  I like that kid drinks are free but my kids didn't care for the wings, boneless wings or small burger.  They do like the dessert pizza but it is $7!!!  Plus they had no cheesecake bites the second time we had it.  The service once was fine and the second time was horrible and slow.  Also the TV's are so loud it hurts my ears.

I'm impressed.  My new favorite sandwich spot.  Good clean, open environment.  Friendly service.  Good sandwiches.  Amazing cookies.  Good prices.  The only negative was the heavy advertising of gluten free bread and then they didn't actually have any gluten free bread the day we went.  I think my husband would have gone back again already if they had.

Just not that great.  I can appreciate what they are trying to do but really it is just a dusty, understaffed farm located off a major road.  It isn't very pretty to look at and it is very simple.  Seems they put more effort into the gift shop area then in the experience.  If you are looking for something moderately priced to do with children under 10 to celebrate the Halloween season... and you live somewhat close by... it might be worth the experience.

Decent bar food.  Friendly service, cheap drinks.  Like the patio.  Love when Vintage Rocket band is playing.  Can bring the kids to listen to music since food is served until 2am!    CHEAP!

This is AMAZING!!  First you choose what you want from the menu- ice cream (17% fat and DELICOUS), custard, frozen yogurt or soy ice cream.  They pour it as a liquid into a big metal bowl.  Then you choose from a large list of flavorings.  For example if you want chocolate flavored ice cream they will add chocolate syrup or hot fudge to the liquid.  Then you choose toppings.  Think cold stone creamery here... you can add candy, fruit, nuts, ect.  Then with a metal spoon and while blowing liquid nitrogen on the bowl with "stuff" they mix up and freeze your concoction right in front of you.  The kids had a blast.  The ice cream was so good.  A kid size bowl is inexpensive and more than plenty of sugar.  It is big.  My only complaint is that they are closed on Sundays.  :(

The second restaurant I tried for Arizona Restaurant Week.  It was packed at 8 PM on a Thursday.  Ambiance was nice.  Loved the t-shirt for sale.  Tried: house smoked onion and potato soup, crispy toasted cheese chips - YUM! deep fried deviled eggs, hot sauce aioli, pickled fresno, pickles - YUCK!  Didn't care for this at all. spring pea pasta, double corn broth, spring greens - DELICIOUS pineapple upside down cake, amarena cherry ice cream - didn't care for the dense/eggy cake but the ice cream was the bomb.  My friend tried the Beckett's original green chili pork stew, corn bread, cotija cheese, cilantro and wasn't impressed but she did love the bacon chocolate s'mores, graham cracker, housemade marshmallow, caramel sauce, peanut butter mousse.  I would go back here again.

I enjoyed a fancy happy hour.  Was not economical like you usually think of happy hour being though.  Really enjoyed the spicy mojito but it was $8 a pop.  Tried the polenta fries.  I did not like the dipping sauce (the item said vegetarian but tasted like it had anchovies in the sauce.  ick!)  My husband tried the sweet potato planks and enjoyed them.  The best was the 4 cheese plate.  Mmm... next time we will just get that and a couple drinks.  I think with tax and tip we paid over $60 for happy hour.

The service at this location was HORRENDOUS.  Was not informed that soda is not included with the meal but milk, tea and coffee are.  So my son ordered a soda which was like $2.50 extra when he would have been happy with the free iced tea.  The salads came out with almost no dressing on them.  When I asked for more we were charged $.75 per salad for more.  Ordered a kids meal for my 6 year old.  Was brought out a regular sized meal.  When I asked the waitress informed me it was an adult portion.  When I said I wanted a kid meal she took the adult meal back and made us wait about 5 minutes for the kid portion to come back.  Had to ask for drink refills.  Waited forever for the bill and even longer for her to pick the bill up.

Let me start off by saying I am not a fan of buffets.  However, we were excited to try this place when it opened.  We went on a Sunday night before 5pm.  When you walk in you must pay for your food right away.  Then you wait to be seated.    We waited over 20 minutes.  The restaurant is busy with a high turnover and the carpets were dirty with food scraps.  The food is all sub par.  Not good at all.  For sushi I tried a roll with cream cheese and a sliver of green pepper.  Yuck!  I tried the chow mein noodles- Yuck!  Panda Express is about 100% better.  Tried the sweet sugar roll and it was stale- Yuck!  The cream cheese wanton had an old grease taste.- Yuck!  In fact the only thing edible was the broccolli and the bananas in a red sauce.  A total waste of $45 for our family to eat there.  My husband and I agreed to never go back.  That being said my 12 year old son loved it.... go figure.

Service started out bad.  We likely sat at the bar for a good 15 minutes with no employee saying anything to us.  Once we started to get served drinks though the bartenders were friendly and attentive.    Great happy hour.  Had some lemon cocktail with fresh raspberry puree on top.  So good I drank 3!  Hubby had the antipasto plate and wasn't that thrilled with it.  I had the soft pretzel bites with the cheese fondue.  It was FANTASTIC!  The best soft pretzels and cheese ever.  I can't recommend them highly enough.

Shocked that this place isn't rated better, overall.  First off I am a vegetarian and my husband is gluten free so that fact that this specialized restaurant is locally owned and somewhat near our home is AWESOME!!  Went on Mother's Day... the service was just okay.  The salad bar didn't look that yummy to me so for $7.99 a pound or whatever it is we just stuck to the menu.  First part of the menu is a bunch of different falafel sandwiches.  We got the original.  LOVED the falafel bar with toppings.  The sauces were delicious.  Loved having tons of pickles and beets and cabbage in my sandwich.  Mmmm...  I also shared a wrap with my girls- bean, cheese and house made tofu.  It was huge.  Also good but the falafel was better.  My husband and son ordered the gluten free chipotle cream pasta.  It was the first gluten free pasta I have ever tasted that I liked.  Very, very good!  Also, this place has free wifi.  Always a plus in our book!!  We will be back.

This is the best Irish bar/restaurant I have ever been to.  The waiter was kind, helpful and attentive.  I also loved the Irish accent!  Went for a late dinner- 11:15pm!  Not sure I have ever had dinner at that hour before- that's Las Vegas for you.    Ordered a mojito to drink- I know not a great Irish choice but I was craving one.  Turned out to be a bad choice.  Not great at all.  Think it cost $9.  Got the cup of Potato Leek soup from the specials menu.  I was suprised to learn it was vegetarian and it was DELICIOUS!!  Even the bread it came with was yummy- smells terrible was tasted great.  Loved that they serve Irish butter!!  I also ordered the potato cakes off the appetizer menu.  Very yummy.  Recommend!  My husband got the corned beef and cabbage with mashed potatoes.  He liked it but suprised to find it served with gravy which contained wheat to thicken it.  He tries to eat gluten free.

I really wanted to hate this place (it reminds me of Pane Bianco in that way).  I arrived on a Wednesday at 11:45'ish to get take out lunch.  Between waiting in line, ordering and then receiving my to-go food it took 45 MINUTES!!  I was so hungry and getting madder by the minute.  Then I finally got the food, ran to my car and started to eat.  The little container that I had to pay $1 extra for to get macaroni and cheese was so super tiny.  I'm talking about a container you would expect your salad dressing to come in!  However, the taste was DELICIOUS.  So so so good.  Then I moved onto the roasted vegetable and cheese sandwich.  The bread was so flaky and good.  I chowed the whole thing down and ended up with crumbs in my shirt, all over my pants and covering the driver seat of my car.  This food is not meant to be eaten in the car!!!  I will eat here again but I will go at an off time and not during the usually lunch hour.  Although, it would greatly help the situation if they didn't have only one worker doing the register, taking orders and delivering food from the kitchen.

Just did take out.  Great experience.  Easy to place my order over the phone, friendly service.  Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance.  Made it an in and out operation.  Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again.  I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN.  I highly recommend it.

Won't be going back.  Husband ordered a gin and tonic.  Had to send it back as it didn't taste good and he was told they don't have tonic so they make their own?!?!?  The vegetarian sushi rolls we ordered did not taste or look that fresh... the avocado was brown.  Ick!  Did enjoy the rolls with asparagus tempura but they ran out of asparagus so we couldn't order anymore.  Also, the interior really needs to be fixed up.  They place did not have a nice ambiance and a big piece of wood blocking the old window to outside.  I can't imagine this place will be in business for much longer.

I don't get it.  I thought for the amount of food we got and the quality that it was overpriced.  Tried the veggie burger.  The flavor was fine but it was very thin and crumbly and made a terrible mess.  Did not like the smash fries at all.  Our family of 5 didn't even finish the one order.  The line was very long on a Sunday afternoon and the service was not great.  We won't be going back.

My girls (age 6 & 8) love coming here for the Parent's Night Out.  It costs me $25 each to drop them off to play and have pizza from 7pm-11pm.    I wish the hours were 6pm to 10pm instead.  Also, my daughter said the pizza wasn't very good last time.  However, the pros outweigh the cons and we are fans.

Also Meh.  I thought the ambiance was cute and had high expectations.  Tried the Guinness Fondue with pretzels and liked it even though $9.99 does seem high for what you get.  The pretzels were good.  Dip was good - a bit of spice but couldn't taste the Guinness.    My daughter and I each got a cup of potato leek soup.  It was icky.  Potato leek soup is my favorite food and I make it at home often.  This had a weird flavor though and was super peppery!  My daughter sent hers back.  I ate only because I was starving.  People we were with order the pasty and it didn't look that great though he said it was good.  Other person had a bacon cheeseburger and it actually looked amazing.  If I ever found myself at this place again I would order a burger!  Service was slow - I think there were only 2 employees doing all the stuff in restaurant and bar!

I really wasn't impressed.  Bummer because I had wanted to try this place for so long before we finally did.  I brought my 3 children on a hot day.  Anything on Mill Ave can be difficult as you have to find parking.  We found a metered spot about 1 1/2 blocks away.  I believe I payed about $3 dollars each.  The popsicles are premade and packaged in a freezer when you walk in.  One child had Mexican Hot Chocolate I had lime something.  It tasted like it was made with nonfat yogurt.  It was a strong flavor.  It wasn't sweet at all.  The popsicle was rolled in sugar which made for a fun textural eating experience but the overall taste was odd.  I would rather spend my $12 at Slickables.  (Actually Slickables would cost less.)

As much as I want to love this library I just can't.  It is beautiful and located within 1/2 a mile of my house.  I was so excited when it was being built and first opening up.   Now I am going to be forced to drive to Ocotillo Library.  This library has an atrocious parking situation.  Because it is connected to South Mountain Community College you have students parking in the library only spots and nothing seems to be happening about it.  I complain every time I go to the library because I circle and circle the lot and find nothing.  Many other cars are circling.  I end up having to use the 5 minute loading parking spot and run in and out and not enjoy my experience at the library.  Every time the parking lot is jam packed the library is empty.  :(  The staff here are also pretty unhelpful and unfriendly.  They don't go out of their way to be rude or stand offish'  they just are.

What could possibly be better than a locally owned business that really cares about what they are doing, their customers and the entire experience?  This is an adorable little shop in a great location/shopping complex.  The customer service is spot on... you could get nicer ladies.  Prices are extremely competitive.  I highly recommend this place for your undergarments and pajamas.  Check it out!

Great customer service.  My favorite was the beef with string beans.  Second favorite was the pork dumplings.  Least favorite was the onion pancakes - they reminded me of naan bread or something when I was expecting a fried up onion ring/potato pancake looking thing.

Exactly what many others have said.  $2 for a fresh ice cream sandwich?  $1.50 for an ice cream scoop.  Total bargain!!!  The service was quick and friendly.  I tried the chocolate chip cookies (mmm... soft and delicious) with the peanut butter cup ice cream.  Really, I ate the whole thing even though I felt like I was going to throw up because I was so full.    A winner in my book!  I hope they stay open forever so we can make it a regular dessert place.

Great friendly service.  I recommend a reservation though if you are coming with more than 2 people, even during the week.    Happy Hour is from 3 - 6.  Enjoyed my mojito - it was very strong.  Also the $5 happy hour garlic fries and the $5 brie cheese with bread and jam.  Loved the jam but not so much the walnut bread.  Shared two flatbreads.  Didn't like the Italian that much (though it was my two friends favorite) but the Vintage was amazing!!!  So so so good!

YUM!  I always order a vegetarian burrito with black beans.  I ask for an extra tortilla (free) so I can take half the stuffing out of the burrito and save it for a meal later.

Tried this place on a whim as we were driving by.  They were offering 50% off all entrees for the grand opening.  My husband and I weren't even hungry but we decided to share something just to give it a try.  We had the soup and salad combo which at half off cost around $4 and some change!  We got the White Bean & Vegetable soup because it was both gluten free (hubby) and vegetarian (me).  It was very tasty.  I wasn't expecting much and really liked it.  We also had the berry salad.  It had blueberry, strawberry, raspberry and pomegranate as well as finely chopped cinnamon almonds and a lemon poppy seed dressing.  It was really good.  I didn't think the chocolate dipped strawberry was that great.  Didn't taste overly fresh to me.  But the slice of bread that came with the soup was DELICIOUS!  I would go again.  And will be even happier if they have fresh brewed iced tea.

Yummy!  Yummy!  Yummy!  Get in my tummy.  We got take out from here on Christmas Eve based on yelp reviews and the fact that it would be open.  Ordered Deluxe Nachos, Taco Salad with shredded beef, Colorado Burrito with rice and beans, Tamale with rice and beans, Tacos al Carbon and 2 grilled cheese kids meals - one with rice and beans and the other with fries.  The total was $59 and it came with chips and salsa.  The service was friendly and the food was amazing.  I was craving it so much that we went back to dine in only 4 days later.  This time I ordered the combination plate with Colorado burrito, chili relleno and all beans.  My son tried a chimichanga and my daughter had the chicken strips.  The chips and salsa are so good.  I'm not sure if you get free refills on them though because they never offered.  Loved the burrito and chili relleno.  The beans are a little bit flavorless and the chimichanga was was easy to forget.... It was very lightly fried.  My daughter wouldn't really eat the chicken strips because it was a big breast of chicken breaded and fried and then sliced.  She didn't like that the strips were not fully breaded.  I look forward to going back again.  Cute and super clean facility.

I am so so so disappointed to do this update.  To go from a restaurant where we enjoyed a 5 star meal, introduced friends and used it as the go to place for both dining in and take out - around 2 times PER WEEK to the terrible experience we had at lunch today.  My son said his chili relleno and enchilada combination plate was not nearly to the quality he has come to expect.  The Colorado burrito was a huge disappointment for the first time.  My 11 year old daughter (who is very very picky about Mexican food) ordered an a la carte burrito with rice, beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato and sour cream.  It came out as a huge burrito on a plate with rice and beans.  Only thing in the burrito was beans, cheese, lettuce and tomato.  This was cooked IN THE OVEN?!?!  The lettuce was the texture and consistency of spinach.  The sour cream was on the side.  Needless to say she hated all of it and wouldn't touch it or eat it.  My 9 year old daughter ordered taquitos (2) off the kids menu with guacamole and fries instead of rice and beans.  The taquitos (2) was actually a shredded beef and cheese chimichanga cut into 5 slices.  The guacamole was on top of the french fries.  The guacamole had chunks of jalapeno in it which made it to spicy for her to eat.  I had to try and scrape it off.  She also refused to eat it.  I was charged an extra $2.95 for the guacamole bringing the price of this kids meal (with no drink) to $7.95  I sent the a la carte burrito back.    Get the bill and have been charged $8.95 for the burrito plus $.75 cents for lettuce and $.99 for sour cream.  I told them I wasn't paying for it when she didn't get what she ordered and didn't like what she got.  The waiter argued with me and said he would take 50% off of the charge for that burrito.  I said I wasn't paying for it and that we were also not happy with the kids meal but wasn't complaining about it yet....  He left to talk to his manager and didn't come back for over 5 minutes.  At this point I was super close to just walking out and leaving an amount of cash on the table that I thought fair for the meal.  (My husband also had an enchilada plate.)   He brought the bill back with most of the burrito taken off except the $.99 for the side of sour cream.  I circled it in pink pen and wrote in capital letters TIP next to it.  Then left the $33.76 in cash on the table.  We will not return sadly enough.  Guess we have to find a new restaurant to frequent.  :(

This location has friendly staff but they can be so so so so unbearably slow on the weekends getting your food to you.  Like the iced coffee with cream and sweet and low.  Yummy breakfast sandwich with egg and cheese on a small tortilla.  Good hash brown bites.  I can't figure out why the croissant donut is so much more expensive than the other donuts.    I like the two big comfy leather chairs to sit in here.

The best breakfast restaurant I have EVER eaten at.  YUM!  Loved the lady that opened it about 7 months ago.  There were no tables available when my husband and I arrived at about 10am on a Saturday so we ate on the love seat.  Great ambiance and comfortable.  Have never seen tofu as a breakfast side dish along with ham, bacon or sausage but it was crispy and delish with a sauce on top.  I had the baked blueberry pancakes.  So good!  Must have had 10 blueberries in each bite.  The french toast looked beautiful and tasty but I don't like cinnamon so I didn't try it.

This was good and fun.  It was a nice place to go as a family and not very expensive.  However, we enjoy making sushi at home and that is an even cheaper option.  Head over to Ranch Market at the Chinese Cultural Center.  Pick up a rice cooker, Japanese Calrose Rice, Sushi Vinegar, seaweed, all the veggies you want and sushi grade fish of your choice.  Don't forget a bottle of sake for $4.85.  Our family of 5 can have all you can eat sushi and all you can drink sake (for the adults) and it only costs $20 at home.  Okay, back to HDYR.... The menu has 6 featured roll choices ranging from $5.95 - $9.95.  The funnest thing though is to choose your own.  #1 You Choose Your Wrap & Rice- seaweed is $3.95 per roll and soy paper is $4.95 per roll.  Your choice of white or brown rice for free.  You can choose up to 3 "veggies" to go in the roll.  Choices are: Asparagus, Avocado, Baby Spinach, Cream Cheese, Cucumber, Green Onions, Jalapenos, Sprouts, Egg, Tofu Skin, Seasonal Fruits & Seasonal Veggies.  If you want to add a meat to your sushi roll it is an additional $1.95 (for beef or chicken or crabsticks) up to $2.95 (for freshwater eel, shrimp or seasonal fish).  Some toppings like chili powder, sesame seeds and cilantro are free.  Others cost money ranging from 99c (crunchy tempura & smelt egg) up to $3 for some seasonal offerings.  Sauces on top are free- creamy miso, ponzu, spicy mayo, teriyaki, japanese mayo, sesame chili oil, sweet chili and wasabi mayo.  All sushi rolls are 10 pieces.   HDYR also has salads- cucumber, seaweed and calamari.  edamame and miso soup.  For dessert you could get mochi ice cream for $3.  Drinks are tea/soda/water/japanese soda as well as beer, wine and sake.  They do have a kids meal for $3.99.  This includes a 5 piece junior roll OR beef or chicken teriyaki bowl with edamamae or a fruit cup, kids drink and a toy.  My kids wanted a full size 10 piece veggie roll for $3.95 and a bowl of miso soup for 99c and a free cup of water with lemon.  I felt that was a better value for us.

Went to Costco to grab a pizza and the ovens were down.  Quickly yelped a pizza place in the area and this came up.  Called in a large cheese pizza for pick up.  $7.55 with tax.  The smell of the pizza was amazing and very garlicy.  The look was thin with lots of dripping cheese.  I brought it to a friends house and it was devoured.  Everyone loved it.  Unfortunately I wasn't hungry so didn't get the opportunity to taste it.  I WILL be back though!!

Had to wait a little for a table.  The first time we were seated was right by the open kitchen.  It was so loud that we asked to be moved.  We had to wait again for a new table.  The waiter wasn't overly friendly or helpful.  (In fact he spilled one of our glasses of wine.  He right away brought over a new glass (in case the first one had a crack in it) but didn't bring a replacement of the wine until we asked and even then he brought like 1 oz.  I'm sure more than that spilled and it seemed rude not to just replace the entire glass of wine.)  I had a cucumber cocktail that was so good I had two.  Also, we shared the sampler of hummus that was delicious.  For my meal I ordered the caprese plate with pita chips.  It was amazing.  Really, really good.  My only complaint is that it only came with 3 wedges of pita chip.  I needed more and was charged $2.99 for a small plate.  Darn!  If the food and drink weren't so good I would never come back!  ;)

This was the worst!  I took my daughter here last Saturday to get 3 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole.  She really wanted that and this was on our way to where we were going.  Pulled up to the microphone and a young gal asked me to come to the window.  We had to wait for a vehicle in front of us to order, wait for their food to be made and pay before we could even order.  It was soooo slow!  It took us 25 minutes from the time we pulled in until we pulled out.  For drive through that is CRAZY.  I would never go here again.  Ever!

Loved this place!  Was even able to enjoy sitting outside on a cold night.  Had one of the coupons for an appetizer, 2 entrees and dessert.  Tried: skin on fries - GOOD  Shelby's Spinach Salad - huge, beautiful and GOOD  Hatch Chili burger on Gluten Free Bun- He was in HEAVEN  Sweet Potato Tater Tots- SERIOUSLY AMAZING.  I don't even care for sweet potato french fries but something about this being mashed up in the middle and crunchy on the outside with salt.  I can't wait to have them again.  Pineapple Teriyaki Aoli - SERIOUSLY AMAZING 2.  I am slightly allergic to pineapple and don't like mayo at all so I almost never like aoli.  This dip with the tots is the bomb.    Ketchup - what's there to say?  Spicy Ketchup - okay.  what you would expect.  Chipotle Ranch - My second favorite dip.  Chocolate Lava milkshake with a shot of Bailey's - YUMMMM  They had run out of pot brownies by the time we wanted dessert and that made me really sad.  I guess it gives us a reason to return soon though.

I thought this place was pretty bad - bordering on gross.  We went for the first time on a Saturday night.  It was pretty busy, a bit dirty (tables not clean, trash on floor) and the menu is pretty large and overwhelming.  When I finally got my three kids to tell me what they wanted I went up and ordered.    Wow!  For fast food that was pricey!    My husband ordered a burger and fries.  He then realized from the nutritional menu I picked up that the fries were not gluten free so he couldn't eat them.  I had a veggie burger with cheese and mushrooms.  I almost couldn't eat it.  It was the worst veggie burger I had ever had.  I also tried the cheese curd - a mix of yellow and white cheese, deep fried and they offered me packets of BBQ sauce or ranch to dip them in.  They were not good.  I don't recommend them.  The custard was the only thing that wasn't bad but I don't think I will be able to stomach going back to get it again.

Terrible experience.  My brand new Honda Odyssey (2 weeks old) was dusty from our trip to Colorado.  Decided on a whim to just drive it through for a quick wash even though it was likely going to rain later.  Just paid for the $4 drive through wash.  There was little instruction on how or where to drive up to.  I must have done something wrong because the soap sprayed out all over my van and then everything shut off.  I pulled around by the office where I see a sign that the employee will be back soon.  I try the door - locked.  I ring the buzzer and knock - nothing.  I call the phone number and leave a message on the machine.  Never get a call back.  After waiting for 10 minutes the employee still is no where in sight.  I decide to drive to another car wash to get the soap off.    I go to one closer to home that I am familiar with and that has employees to spray down your vehicle first and guide you through the wash.  The employee at the second car wash is shocked to hear my story and works hard to get the soap off.  He is concerned that it has come off the body of the vehicles but not completely off the windows and that they are stained.  I panic.  I drive home and windex all the windows.  It seems to go away.  I call Spot Free and the employee (Shawn I believe?) who tells me it is a small family owned place and he is the manager answers the phone.  He explains it is just soap and not acid and will not hurt my car long term.  That the place is open 24 hours a day and he is there just 10 of those 24 but left to have lunch.  I am glad all worked out well but I wasted $4 at Spot Free then had to pay another $5 somewhere else and went through the stress of the situation and wasted an hour or more of my busy day.  Unless I had free washes I would never go to this place again.  I'm sure this place will be featured in future nightmares of mine.

I'm just not feeling it.  I took my two girls for a treat.  The service was very friendly but the Italian Ice did nothing for me.  It didn't remind me at all of what I used to eat as a kid on the beach in New Jersey.  We were offered samples and tried - marshmallow peanut butter (tasted like air with little balls of peanut butter), pink lemonade (blech) and blue raspberry (boring!).  We were going to order something as we had the Entertainment Coupons.  One was for a free medium size ice and the other was buy one get one.  So for less then $3 we got 3 ices.  I ordered honeydew and then asked what the most popular flavor was.  I was told mango by the two employees.  So I had them top it with mango.  I didn't like the mango AT ALL.  Because it was layered though and I am now in my car I have to eat all of it to even get to the honeydew flavor I wanted.  What a disappointment.  It also was yucky.  Threw the rest of the cup away when I got home.  We won't be back.

Seriously the BEST restaurant in this area!  We went on Father's Day and it was the perfect place to go as it wasn't overly crowded.  There are only 5 tables in the entire restaurant so it is SMALL.  The bathroom is strange and dingy but the food and the service makes up for it.  Maybe I should back up.  We ordered the egg rolls and the spring rolls.  They were not good.  The veggie spring rolls were actually not good at all.  Was like a cheap wilting bag of lettuce/carrot mix from the grocery store rolled up.  I only ate half of one.  Then came out the food.  My girls were sharing a tofu pad thai.  It smelled DISGUSTING.  I think maybe I am just not a fan of pad thai?  My husband got the chicken sweet basil heat #5 and was in heaven.  My son got the red pineapple curry with beef heat #3 and very much enjoyed it.  I had the eggplant with tofu heat #1 and it was seriously AMAZING.  Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  Then for dessert we were brought out complimentary green tea iced cream and fried bananas.  They are so good!  I could never eat here again and not order them.  I keep thinking about them 2 days later!!

Good but not overly cheap and the service was HORRIBLE.  Servers were polite but couldn't answer questions about the menu or what the dishes we were served were.  We tried several rolls and I have to say my favorite was the simple avocado roll.  Huge chunks of fresh avocado.  The mixed tempura I wouldn't order again... I was surprised by the Monkey Brains appetizer.  It wasn't what I expected.  It was basically a stuffed mushroom (stuffed with spicy tuna) breaded in tempura batter and deep fried.  I think my favorite thing of all was the Lychee Martini.  So strong and a wonderful flavor.    I think we will try this place again for the 1/2 price Teppanyaki at Happy Hour.

This place drives me nuts.  The staff is so blase about their job and service.  Twice the have not honored the prices advertised on their menu.  First time was for specials on a separate board.  I was told it was passed time.  Okay, fine even though nothing states that.  Next time they charged me almost double what the menu listed as the price for beer.  When I questioned it I was told the prices had changed.  Um, don't you have to change the menu on the wall then to reflect that?    Have had the pizza, gluten free pizza, wings and ravioli.  They are all fine.  The cheese garlic bread and cookie dessert are my favorite menu items though.  I do like that they let any age order off the kids menu if you want a smaller meal with a drink.

I was very excited to see this new Krispy Kreme.  I took my kids the same day I noticed it.  It looks like the Hot & Ready sign is always on.  When you walk in there won't necessarily be donuts on the belt, however if you ask them to they will put the donuts on there for you and in about 2 minutes you will have hot, melt in your mouth deliciousness.  One of my daughters wanted to try the cookies N cream doughnut.  She didn't like it but did like their original one that was hot.  Also, we bought 2 milks for $1.69 each and found out that you get a free original doughnut with a milk purchase.  Score!

Yummy frozen yogurt and lots of fun toppings to choose from.    I had sticker shock when the bill for 4 yogurts rang up at $25!!!  I was a bit disappointed that you have to pay 50 cents extra for whip cream and then they put in on before weighing your cup.  Feel like I am double paying for it.  We went back again with the kids report cards so they could get a free yogurt up to $2.50.  Two of my kids had super small ones and my sons was just small.  I ended up having to pay a buck and some change for my sons.  Looking forward to going in PJ's on a Wednesday night for 1/2 off.  That might make it more reasonably priced.

I think this is my third time trying this place?  The corn fritter appetizer is very good.  The service was pretty friendly, a little helpful and very efficient.  Everything else is meh.  We were seated in a booth that had the soda dispenser on the other side of the wall.  The sound of it was very annoying while trying to dine.  The bread was the texture of a hockey puck.  Thought it was a fluke and we asked for different bread - same situation.  The rib eye steak is way over seasoned in my opinion.  Got the one on the grill not from pan.  Tried the dessert sampler and was not impressed with a single thing of the three options.  The place is just over priced for what you get.  Texas Roadhouse is much better.

YUM!  You must go here to eat if you are in the mood for any of the 4/5/8 items on the menu.  My only wish is that they offered a vegetarian burger.  We tried: The Stand burger with fried jalapenos, bacon and gluten free bun.  My husband LOVED it.  Veggie taco was amazing.  The yellow squash topped with pickled cabbage, cilantro and cojita cheese.  Squeeze the fresh lime on top.  Mmmmmm.... I didn't receive any salsa which I wish I had but it was still very good.  French fries were outstanding.  I was worried since some reviews stated pepper on them.  I do not like pepper but these were perfectly sliced and perfectly fried and seasoned.  So good.  I wish I could have eaten more of them.  Was to full for the two of us to finish the serving.  Chocolate Chili milkshake was strange.  A Mexican hot chocolate flavor with cinnamon.  I don't care for cinnamon.  The burn when it went down your throat was exciting though.  Hubby wouldn't put it down.  He was in heaven.  Salted Dulce De Leche milkshake was so so so good.  Can't wait for another one.  We had a groupon or deal chicken or something and hope to see another one soon but will be back either way.  It was HOT and we were forced to sit outside on the air conditioned patio because the 4 tables inside were taken.  The air conditioning blowing straight on you helped but it still wasn't comfortable.  Service was very attentive and the owner or manager seemed very friendly.

Weird that I have to be the first dissenting review.  I thought the service here was HORRIBLE.  They were aloof, not very helpful and certainly not customer service oriented.  We go to Subway often as sandwiches happen to be my three children's favorite food.  The two younger ones ALWAYS order a kids pack.  They usually get a choice of chips or 2 cookies with their meal.  This location would only give one cookie.  Even after I explained that is not usually the case or that the price would not make sense they refused.  Whatever!  I know where we will not be stopping regularly.

Not impressed at all!  We had a groupon and I was really really really looking forward to date night here.  Service seemed really friendly until we took out our groupon.  We were moved into the bar section (this might be our fault as I decided it was to hot to sit outside) and given a different waiter.  The food wasn't good either.  Had some appetizer with an egg and asparagus.  I can't even find it on the menu now to give the name.  It was actually icky and a small portion.  If I was starving when it arrived I wouldn't have even ate it.  Left a taste in my mouth that I didn't like.   Husband tried the flat iron steak.  I didn't think it was good at all.  He is less picky and ate his food happily.  I had some dish that looked like pot roast (also can't find on the menu now).  It was recommended to me by the waiter and I didn't care at all for it.  Very fatty and I could have gotten a better flavor in my crock pot at home.  For dessert we tried the cheese plate.  This was the only redeeming part of the meal.  The goat cheese was delicious and the other items were also yummy.  If not for the cheese plate I would have left crying - it was that bad.

Seriously loved this place!  The only negative is that I called to say we would have a large group (11 or 12) people on a Tuesday night.  I was told I don't really need reservations but whoever answered the phone reluctantly took my name.  This information must not have been saved or passed on because the place got busy and they were way understaffed.  The food and drinks took forever to come out and were one at a time.  However, with our group that wanted to stay and chat it wasn't a problem at all.  I loved the outdoor ambiance.  The rocks and fire pits and comfy couches were awesome.  The service was very friendly.  We got many dished comped at our table.  I'm not sure if the kitchen was preparing duplicate orders or what but we enjoyed that perk.  The mojitos were delicious as were the popcorn, veggie quesadilla, cauliflower and tacos.  Mmmmm... Can't wait to go back.

I am torn on this one.  Food wise it is THE BEST restaurant I have been to in quite a long time.  I loved the ambiance of the couch booths outside and the food and even the wine was delish.  The part I am torn on is it felt sleezy in the used car lot vibe.  First off there are chalkboards out front advertising happy hour $1 bottles of wine.  Same thing on the front of the menu.  (Actually it is also listed that way on the front page of their website.) I actually asked as soon as I sat down if that was a joke.  I was informed you buy a bottle at regular price and the second is $1.  You have to ask or turn over your menu to see that detail.  No asterisk, no small print, nothing.  Is that even legal advertising?!  Second we had a groupon for 4 flights of wine and 2 tapas or bruschetta plates.  The wine was the first to come out.  We were told they were a chardonnay, a merlot and a cabernet sauvignon all from a vineyard in California.  We first tried the white wine and enjoyed it.  Surprised that it tasted like no chardonnay we had ever had we asked with the menu which chardonnay from CA it was.  The waiter left and came back and told us that actually he was wrong and the flight wines are all tap wines from a barrel made in Tuscon?!?!  What is tap wine?  Third when we got our bill only one appetizer was taken off.  When the waiter was informed of the mistake he argued a bit that the groupon was only for one appetizer.  He had to take the coupon out of his pocket to inspect it again.  Then he left and came back having taken off the $4 fries we added on later instead of the $7 Hummus nachos that we had originally ordered as part of the deal.  I pointed it out again and he gave some excuse about timing and the computer taking off least expensive items.  Whatever!  Now onto the food... I had: Hummus Nachos - HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Greek Fries - VERY GOOD! Halloumi Bruschetta - Tasty with a relish/pickled flavoring Grilled Filet Mignon - AMAZING! Wilted Greens with Bacon - Good.  Parmesan French Toast with Tomato Basil Relish - MMMMM... the tomato basil relish was spicy in a sriracha flavored way  My friends tried the Bee Hive sandwich.  One really liked it and one liked everything except the thick sliced prosciutto.    I'm hesitant to go back.... but the food is calling to me... what to do... what to do...

Margaritas have no alcohol in them - and you are seriously still charging over $5?  The tortilla chips and salsa were the tastiest part of the meal.  The service was very efficient and friendly but the waiter had a thick accent that was hard to understand.  I ordered the torta with steak, guacamole and sauce on the side.  The bread was the worst torta bread I ever had.  Doughy and white and not grilled.  The steak was flavorless.  The guacamole was to thin - would have preferred big chunks of avocado and the sauce wasn't good either.  My sandwich was served with Ruffles potato chips!  Yuck!  Friend ordered the carne asada mini tacos and wasn't that impressed either.  Hers looked better than mine though!

Yup!  I'm a major fan.  I love that parking is so easy for a downtown restaurant.  The place is cute and you can dine in the restaurant portion or enjoy the bar or outdoor patio.  The service was very friendly and helpful.  I like that I can get unlimited amounts of water myself when it is hot.  Tried a bowl of the yellow lentil coconut curry soup.  It was huge and delicious and came with two slices of bread for only $6.  My daughter got a lemon bar out of the display case that was amazing for $2.50.  I can't wait to come back and try other things.  The prime rib looked amazing but I was feeling to frugal to pay the $19 price tag.

Went with my three children as part of a homeschool field trip.  It cost just over $5 per person as part of the group.  We LOVED it!!  My kids did not want to go and were complaining.  Now they can't wait to go back again.  The 3D movie was very entertaining and we all learned quite a bit about monarch butterflies.  The display that has butterflies hatching out of their cocoon was my favorite part.  We got to watch 2 different butterflies hatch in the less than 10 minutes we were watching.  Kids had a fabulous time having butterflies land on them and taking pictures.  The scorpions and black light was fun.    Touching the sting rays was fun.  Look forward to coming back!

YUCK!  Went on Valentine's Day.  Was given a bad table and the service wasn't really good.  I ordered a pizza with steak - it wasn't that good.  The plates had a strange damp smell and I started throwing up hours later.  I am unsure if it was food poisoning or a fluke that I got a 24 hour tummy bug around the same time.    I wasn't happy when I left and will certainly never go back!

Service was nice and my food was given to me instantly.  An egg and cheese sandwich on brioche with a small bottle of aquafina water almost $11!  I loved the brioche and the melty cheese.  The eggs where to hard eggs, almost as if they were microwaved in the bottle of a bowl or cup.  The yolks were very green.  I ended up picking them out and just eating the cheese bread.

I liked this place.  Went with a group of friends on a Friday night for Happy Hour.  Got Michelob Ultra for $2.50.  Wine is $6 a glass.  No discount on mixed drinks.  I enjoyed the olives with goat cheese and crustini.  Great serving size and flavor for only $4.  Also had the 1/2 salad with 1/2 pasta.  Got the strawberry salad and forgot to ask for no bacon so I couldn't eat it.  The waitress did not offer to remake it so I just brought it home for hubby.  Tried the mushroom marsala pasta and it was the best part of the night..  Seriously YUM!  The worst part was that there is only one bathroom so we often had to wait for someone to come out of the ladies room to be able to go in.

I was impressed.  Went with my daughter for dinner on a Friday night.  Got seated right away and we ordered everything that sounded good - California rolls, Spicy Salmon Roll, Fried Tofu appetizer, Bulgoki beef, miso soup...  Everything was delicious except the Bulgoki beef.  Didn't like the texture or flavor at all.  Told the waiter and he was so great about taking it back and removing it from our bill.  Will come back!

I really enjoyed the ambiance of sitting outside under the greenery and listening to the birds.   Service was really good and efficient.  Loved the pretzel pieces with beer cheese appetizer and such a good deal on the happy hour menu.    My long island iced teas were not on the happy hour menu so quite pricey.  I also tried the fried green tomato sandwiches.  I thought they were to dry and to much bread to tomato ration with the pretzel buns.  I would not recommend them.  I am going back for the setting and happy hour appetizers!

I didn't realize this was a counter service breakfast place.  We arrived when they opened and the staff was very friendly.  The fresh brewed tea was made and waiting for me to serve myself.  I tried the biscuits and gravy and they were good.  My daughter had an order of 2 pancakes.  They were huge and looked amazing.  One would have been plenty for a normal sized eater!  And much cheaper to order two then the menu listing of 3.  I want to go back and try the chicken friend steak.

First time picked up treats from the bakery case and an iced tea.  The iced tea was super strong - I am passionate about tea and this just wasn't good.  Baked goods were AMAZING.  A scone and a lemon bar.  Second time I brought more people back for breakfast.  This is when I found out the entire restaurant is gluten free!  Could not believe it.  Loved the biscuits and gravy.  Only thing I didn't like was the sausage patty on the side.  Can't wait to come back!

Thought this place was drive through - it isn't but you wouldn't know that by the set up and drive through window.  Wanted to pick up some rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole for my daughter and Filibertos was to far out of the way.  It took FOREVER.  Was EXPENSIVE in comparison to what I usually get her and she didn't like it.  Barely picked at it.  Even though the location is convenient I won't be back.

So much fun!  We went for the first time on Father's Day.  We were told it would be an hour and a half wait and they would text us when our table was ready.  I like how they take notes on what the person is wearing, etc to identify them when they come back for their tables.  Very efficient in a busy environment.  It did not take 1 1/2 hours for our table and I missed the text by about 20 minutes.  It was no big deal upon arrival and our table was ready.  The service was fast and very friendly and helpful.  There is a good choice of food at a very reasonable price.  We tried the Alaskan King Crab legs and the blue crab.  Next time will try the snow crab.  The Alaskan King Crab was good but hard to crack since it is so thick.  Made eating it not was fun.  Tried the garlic butter and it was good but a bit much by the end.  Looking forward to trying cajun next time.  I like that there are big sinks right in the restaurant to clean your messy hands with.  Also fun to take pictures with your entire group wearing a bib.  We will be back and I can't wait!!

Yet another place I couldn't wait to experience.  Miss the Italian Ice trucks on the boardwalk in New Jersey from when I was a kid.  I was blown away by the menu prices when I walked in.  So high for ice and ice cream!  Was handed a sample of the tigers blood ice.  It was actually my favorite part of the experience.  I asked to try the pink grapefruit out of curiosity.  Didn't like it much.  At this point I just ordered the smallest one of bada bing cherry.  Liked the chunks of cherry in the ice but not the overall flavor of the ice.  I also really wanted watermelon when I walked in.  Won't bother going back.

Location was good. Ambiance was the best part. Service was okay - a bit standoffish but bordering on friendly. Food was disappointing and took forever. Son had the Croque Madame.  It was simple.  Egg was cooked well.  Bread with thick sliced ham, some cheese and an egg cooked on top.  Served with lettuce, tiny bit of dressing and a couple tomatoes. I had the baquette with proscuitto and cheese.  The baquette reminded my of Rhodes dinner rolls.  The ones you left proof on the kitchen counter when they are frozen and then bake.  Super minimal amount of meat and think slices of block cheese.  This was something I could easily recreate at home, better for less money. Got a couple macaroons to go for my girls.  They thought they were okay.  This is a trendy item right now that you can get in so many places.  Price here was to high. Did not care for the iced tea (had rose water in it maybe?) and was never offered a refill.  I can't imagine going back to this place.  To many other places to try in the area.

Good food and good service.  It seems close to empty the two times I went though?  I like the coconut soup and the curry.  Thought the dessert was a bit over priced.  Tried the fried bananas with ice cream.  Basically two thin spring rolls filled with banana and a scoop of coconut ice cream for $6.99.  We will enjoy dessert elsewhere next time we dine here.

Not impressed and I was really looking forward to trying it.  Got a cheesesteak with onions and mushrooms and cheese sauce.  The vegetables were al dente and needed to be cooked much longer.  The cheese sauce was under the food and not on top which I prefer.  The cheese sauce also was not tasty.  The best part of the meal were the fries and the vinegar they have available to put on top.  For two cheesesteaks, one fries and one disgusting sweet BBQ order of chicken wings the bill was $27.  For a food court meal!  Ick!

I just waited in line for 1 hour to pay $55 for lunch and can't wait to do it again.  Fatty brisket - amazing! Next time I will get 2 pounds of this brisket - good pastrami - good grits - good but a bit spicy beans - swimming in meat, good mustard BBQ sauce - good house BBQ sauce - good pickles - super spicy but good  To full to try the pecan pies I bought right now.

YES!  I loved this place.  Had a double cheeseburger plain (bread, meat, cheese) and the flavor, texture, size was just perfect.  The peanut butter cup and banana concrete was super good.  My only complaint is cost.  It is quite pricey.  We ordered one burger, an order of 3 chicken tenders, a small milkshake, a small concrete and a small sundae.  Our bill was $22.  We had no fries, no drinks.

I thought this restaurant is very cute.  The service was amazing.  I was impressed by the menu options and price.  The alcoholic beverages are fun and super cheap.  The size is large and very potent.  I had their version of Long Island Iced tea and LOVED it.  For dinner I tried the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich with macaroni and cheese.  I think I would try something else next time.  My friend had chicken pot pie.  She liked it.  I didn't like the face that the crust was only on top.  My daughter had the pasta with marinara and was happy about it.  Her friend had the fried shrimp.  It looked okay.  Looking forward to returning soon.

Not my type of restaurant at all.  The service was super detached and unfriendly as well as unhelpful when I asked questions.  The bathroom had a terrible smell which turned me off before ordering so much that I almost left - should have gone with my instinct and done that.  Tried the sangria.  Every sangria I have ever had was wine with fresh fruit cut up in it.  This was watered down juice with maybe a drop of wine?!?!  Tried some beef sandwich.  It was so boring and flavorless.    I *might* come back to try the smoothies or fresh juice or flavored iced teas.  I would NEVER bother to eat here again.  Bummed because I was hoping for a really good restaurant across the street from my hubby's office.

YUM!  The best Indian food I have ever had.  So good.  Came here for dinner with a groupon.  Tried the paneer tikka masala and like it so much that I bought another groupon (my friend had bought the first one) and went with my husband for dinner THE VERY NEXT NIGHT!  He also very much enjoyed his meal.  This time the spice level was a bit higher on my dish (I am a bit of a wimp) so I commented to the waiter and he took the dish - partially eaten - and remade it!  Brought me a new full, less spicy dish.  That is very good customer service.  Was excited to try the $6.99 lunch buffet.  Small kids are $4.99 or $3.99, I forget.  Brought my three children and they all really enjoyed the mango lassi, garlic nan, rice, potato dish, dessert, etc.  The food was a bit spicier than our pallets enjoy so will likely stick to dinner where we can order the level of spice we prefer.  I recommended this place to friends who bought a groupon and also really enjoyed their dinner.

Fun for the kids.  Needs more comfortable seating options for the parents of older children that are sitting for hours with their friends.  The cafe has limited decent options.  Some good prices and some crazy prices - 16.99 for 18 chicken wings.  Staff not knowing the brand of macaroni & cheese served?  The lost their last star for the cafe food service.

This was the worst and over priced Boba I have ever had.  Was way to sweet.  Didn't care for all the sugar juice that was dumped in the bottom of the cup with the jelly.  I ordered 3 flavors and didn't like it at all.  I gave mine to my kid.  Won't try it again.  The one at Warner and Dobson is way superior.

My dinner there tonight was very uninspired.  Perhaps I ordered all the wrong things?  Ordered from the happy hour menu -  *Red Sangria w/ extra fruit.... the extra fruit was a sliver of lemon and a sliver of orange on the edge of the glass.... a boring sangria if ever I had one.  *Olives & Roasted Red Peppers... these slices of red peppers appeared to be exact same as the jar I buy at Trader Joes.  *Hummus with Cucumbers.... a most boring hummus that I didn't even bother to finish  *Sweet Potato Fries w/ brown sugar dipping sauce.... the fries were fine but way over seasoned.  The dipping sauce was terrible.  I didn't taste brown sugar at all.  It tasted only like honey.  I asked for chipotle ranch instead to dip in and that was ahhh.  I won't be back.  To many restaurants to try... to little time.

Amazing!  Love-Love-Love!  So glad to have found this place.  Tried a make your own hummus bowl with all four types of hummus (cilantro, red pepper, sriracha and original).  Also got both rice and lentils.  Then added cucumber salad, beets, olives, chickpeas and chips and topped with gyros meat.  Mmmmmm...  My daughter got the chicken on hers and was thrilled with it.  We also tried two smoothies with whip cream.  (Energizer ones)  They were just okay.  I would skip the smoothie next time and just stick with the bowl.

Loved our experience at this place.  The location, ambiance and decor are spot on.  The only negative was the weird smell in the restaurant and bathroom.  The service was very good.  Strange that there were very few other diners in the time we were there.  Had dinner and tried - Cereal Killer Milkshakes:  Kids loved them Infused Old Fashioned: Amazing, loved the chunks of cherry Bloody Mary: Delicious, fun with the cheeseburger and cheese curds and roasted red pepper Turkey/Avocado Club:  what you would expect Breakfast Hamburger Sandwich: Fabulous Short Rib Hash & Eggs: Pretty Good  Very much look forward to coming back.

Went here just to get a slice of peppermint pie since a friend posted a picture of it on facebook.  The service was super friendly and fast.  The pie was just okay though, I was really disappointed as I was looking forward to it.  Two slices of pie were small (though very rich) and the price was crazy expensive for to-go.  I believe $4.50 per small slice?  I can't imagine I would ever go back...

It took forever to get take out on a Friday night.  The food and portions were worth it though.  I had the waffle with skirt steak, avocado and chipotle sauce.  It was delicious.  Loved the waffle and all the toppings.  Only problem was everything was cut in bite size pieces and then put on the waffle.  This made it almost impossible to eat as a sandwich.  I think a big chunk of steak would make much more sense.  Husband tried the carne asada fries.  Was so big he couldn't even finish.  One child had the kids meal pb&j and was happy.  Other got one of the egg ones but wanted the egg and meat on the side of the waffles .  Kids meal portion was same size as adult.    Would like to try more things on the menu.

Not my favorite of the design your own pizza places.  Nice that they have gluten free.  I also liked the sparkling grapefruit juice.  The toppings weren't that exciting and the flavor not that good.  Eklectic Pie in Gilbert is my #1 favorite - whole roasted garlic topping and great prices! The Pizza Press outside Disneyland is my #2 - huge pepperoni slices Pizza Studio in downtown Phoenix is my #3 Fired Pie is my #4 Pieology is last place of the ones I've tried #5

I'm surprised by all the low reviews.  I really love this place.  The only negative is that the service is soooooooo slow.  I always get soup in a bread bowl and a smoothie.  My favorite soup is the white cheddar poblano.  They didn't have any this week so I got artichoke portabello and that was pretty good also.  My girls like the cream of broccoli.    The smoothie I get is the pink pina colada made with peach juice instead of guava juice.  This time we bought the triple chocolate bread and brought it home for breakfast the next morning.  Was super yummy.

I have always had amazing experiences at the Mesa location and this was my first time visiting the Tempe location.  Did call ahead seating and that worked well.  The rolls were not buttery as much as I like them and had to keep asking for more butter and rolls.  The last time they never came.  Was bummed to find that they don't (or no longer?) have a $3 margarita at all times - just during happy hour.  The ribeye, salad and sweet potato were good.  The biggest negative was that the waitress spilled an entire glass of ice water on me and inside my open purse soon after we were seated.  She was very apologetic and it wasn't a big deal - until the end of the meal when I realized my daughters iphone was in the bottom of my purse still swimming in ice and water. I let her know and she got a manager.  They were both helpful and gave me a gift certificate for two free meals.  (Paid for the two meals we had eaten last night.)  I gave the manager my name and phone number and he gave me his and the owner's business card.  Went home and put the iphone in rice overnight.  It didn't help.  The button is not working consistently and there are problems with the sound.  I am hopeful that this situation will be resolved with the restaurant but also still nervous at this point.  Fingers crossed!!  Update that management was very helpful in buying my daughter a replacement phone.  The experience was simple and straight forward.  Thank you!!!

Delicious.  Loved the poutine fries.  Very friendly service.  So glad they were at St Timothy's food truck Friday event.

I took my kids and it was fantastic.  They had samples of the chocolate chocolate chip cake and it was to die for!!  Both my girls ordered a mini one of those.  My son got cinnamon and I got Red Velvet.  I think the chocolate chocolate chip was the best.  $4 for a mini and it is plenty for two.

I was so so so excited to try this place.  I was even more excited after it opened and I drove over.  The ambiance is adorable and they have outdoor eating.  Ordered a hot dog, cheese fries and a chocolate cake shake.  The hot dog was fine, I think Costco sells a way better one.  The fries were just okay also, Del Taco blows them away.... the cheese is served in a little cup on the side and that wasn't to great either.  The chocolate cake shake was actually kinda icky.  There was so much cake it was dry and you couldn't drink it through the straw provided.  I actually took it back and asked to try the strawberry instead.  Also not impressed.  I WILL NOT be back.

Good green smoothies. Good green juice. Kid sizes to small for anyone other than the youngest of children.

Yum!  What a delicious treat at the airport.  The price is reasonable and the flavors and selection were good.  Had a coconut yogurt with shredded coconut and dark chocolate chips.

I waited in line quite a while to order and then quite a long time to receive our food. However, my girls and I were thrilled.  The ambiance is adorable.  A bread bowl of soup (with tons of options to choose from) and a smoothie (with yummy choices!) all for $7?  The flavors were awesome.  We made the mistake of ordering a slice of chocolate peanut butter pie for dessert and we were way to full to even share it.  Took one bite and it wasn't that good anyway.  Threw it away.  Can't wait to come back and I hope they add employees so the service isn't so terrible.

Yum!  Went to the drive through on a whim when I was hungry and needed something quick.  Have been back since.  The burritos are large enough to share, even if you are hungry.  The tortillas are delicious!  The bean and cheese burrito very good.  I added sour cream and that was good the first time and not as great the second time as they layered it in a way that the cheese didn't melt.  The guacamole was something I skipped the second time.

Was hungry and looked for something on yelp that was well rated and near by.  This was the perfect place to get a quick bite to eat.  Very easy to find on the south side of McDowell.  My son and I tried the asada taco and it was delicious.  Packed full of medium cooked chunks of steak.  We also shared two gorditas.  One with beans, ground beef and potatoes.  I loved the filling but wasn't a huge fan of the breading.  Also tried the red chili with potato one.  This was a little spicy but good.  Would stick to tacos or something else next time.  Really wanted to try the bean soup but they were sold out.  The salsa bar was good but out of cucumbers and really low on radishes.  I adored the green avocado salsa.  Service was friendly and big bottles of water for $1 a huge plus in the hot summer months.   Would not hesitate to stop in again for a bite to eat.
