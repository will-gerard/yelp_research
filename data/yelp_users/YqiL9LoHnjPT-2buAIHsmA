We recently used ACSI for the inspection of our new home. Our inspection was done by Tim who did a very thorough job. He also walked us though all the main issues and took the time to explain everything, and recommended a few inexpensive easy fixes. After we moved in I noticed that a 4 way switch wasn't working at our stairs. With all the hassle of moving, I didn't think much of it. After living there for a month it was a big nuisance to not be able to have a light to walk up the stairs at night. Last week I got an email from ACSI asking if I was still pleased with my inspection, and for the record overall I was. I called them and asked if there was anything that could be done b/c I felt the inspector should have found the switches weren't working. They were so helpful, and sent out Dave the next day! He was there promptly at 9am and stayed until the switches were fixed. He even ran to the store and bought a new switch. He was there over 2 and half hours and dealt with my kids jumping over him to get to their rooms. He was AMAZING to stay until the job was done and dealt with all of us in his way. A big thank you to Dave and ACSI for coming out and fixing this for us. It truly is appreciated!!!!!

I agree with Ken B. I actually had been coming here for years. Thought they were fair and I like that they looked over my car. I just went there again for an oil change. When I dropped the car off I told Wooley about my wiper spray didn't go on my window so he sprayed it and it went in my face, then he said sorry and did it again!! He really wasn't sorry nor did he offer a towel or anything. I went to pick up the car,  I had a coupon for $29.99 which actually was $37.00 with tax and other fees. FIne I paid it saw the checked everything in green as if it was all OK, so I drove off. I get a call from my boyfriend who drove me there and informed me that my brake light was out! They hadn't checked anything on my car. I don't even know if the changed my oil. I will never go back. I suggest you don't either.

First we were seated and then it took close to 20 mins. for someone to even acknowledge we were seated. When the waiter actually came he had nothing to use to write own our order. He had to borrow my pen. Then HE STOLE MY PEN, and I never got it back. The food was bland and not very flavorful. There were no gluten free options. When I asked for garlic powder it was like I asked him for the moon. He didn't think they had any, so he went to go check, but he never even came back. The bill was so expensive and no alcohol was purchased. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The bathrooms were dirty and smelled of burnt crust. Coincidentally our crust was burt as well.
