Pros: Very good food (I got the waffle breakfast with eggs and sausage and it was delicious) Good service even in the middle of the night (we had a friendly and attentive waitress) Charming retro decor  Con: This place is filthy. Our booth was covered in crumbs, shredded lettuce, other people's hair, and even dirty silverware between the cushions. It was gross. We only stayed to eat because there was nowhere else to go and we were hungry, but it was disgusting. The waitstaff does not seem so busy that they couldn't take a minute between customers to clean the booths and make sure that the next guests won't have to sit in filth.  It was my first time coming here, and although I liked the food, I can't imagine willingly going back and sitting in those dirty surroundings again.

I live only a couple minutes down the road from this place, and I am so sad that it took me almost a year before trying it out. The food is delicious and the most authentic-tasting that I've had in Phoenix. Egg rolls are greasy but delicious, the more "American" dishes like General Chicken are spot on, and the more authentic stuff like Hunan Beef (do yourself a favor and give it a try) is amazing.  Service is heavily accented but very friendly and pleasant. They also have a decent happy hour until 7:30pm weekdays. I'll be going back again and again.

5 Star wings! Absolutely delicious hot wings. But only 3 Star pizza... Not the best crust, but it's still good for the price. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone in the neighborhood.

This place seriously has the best Mocha/Iced Mocha in Phoenix. I've tried all the major coffee shops in the Central Phoenix and Scottsdale area, and the Mocha here is the best. I inquired, and I guess they get their coffee from a small California roaster called Verve, which I had never heard of before. A quick Google search shows that they're based in L.A. and in the process of expanding their operations quite a bit. With coffee this good, I'm not surprised.  The shop itself is generally quiet, which makes it an ideal place to hang out with a friend or sit and study for a while. It has a good selection of large tables for your laptop or whatever you've brought, and I've never struggled to find space.  Overall a great local spot right on Indian School, and I'll be coming back.

Quite simply the best donuts in Phoenix! Try the buttermilk, the original glazed, and the cinnamon crumble.

Great rotating selection of beers and great food to pair with them. They have excellent flatbread pizza and some of the best burgers in Phoenix.   Staff is great overall and if you can't decide on a beer, ask their bartender, Cory. She's great and can always pick a good one for your taste!

Spacious Starbucks with a nice quiet work/study room and a large patio when the days aren't too hot. Staff seems friendly and courteous. Major complaint is that the internet is too slow for most of my purposes. I've visited this Starbucks several times since they opened last year, and the problem with the internet speed remains unchanged, across multiple devices. If you need a decent speed of internet for your work or school assignments/review, you should probably go elsewhere.

First off... very blah coffee. But if you're here for the coffee, you're missing the point.  The donuts are amazing. Creative flavors in creative combinations, about as sugary-sweet and fatty as possible, and just delicious.  So grab your coffee somewhere else and then get your butt to Rollover for amazing donuts.
