I have been going to Phoenicia grill for almost 2 years. It was pretty good tasteful food in the beginning. Decent prices. I remember friendly service and gesture of getting 25% off coupon for next trip. Beef kafta were great and they would even give free lentil soup while you wait for take out orders. Those days are gone.  Couple of weeks ago tried to redeem a coupon but was told restrictions apply. Today ordered two combo plates and a gyro. Looks like beef kafta got shrink to kids size meal. Chicken skewer had 3 tiny pieces and hardly anything else. Looks like they split old days meal into two and selling it as two meals. I know people should loose weight but change in portion side is pretty sudden. You can definitely get better food at zk grill for much better price points. Another great option is Rania which has so much better quality food. Bye bye Phoenicia grill...

Farm fresh from Agritopia Farm..draws large crowds specially during lunch time on weekends... Expect 30 min wait in line to order and another 15-20 to get the food ready...try their daily specials like lamb burger...family friendly and see lots of dog lovers...excellent place to checkout if you are in town

Nice ambience with both in doors and outdoors seatings. Mist makers keep outside seating area to be pleasant on hot AZ days. I ordered Medicine Man (Sea Buckthorn, Pomegranate, Cranberry,Honey, Black Tea & Soda) and was anticipating it to be more sweet but came out tasting more like cranberry juice minus the sugar. It was good to taste nevertheless. Ordered humus which comes with sliced cucumbers and cherry tomato as well as thin sliced pita bread (crunchier approaching bruschetta quality). For main course I had Moroccan half chicken which comes on top of chick peas and spinach. It had drizzle of fig puree. So had bit of sweet taste to it.It was unique taste combination. Usually I get teriyaki bowl which has shiitake, carrots and brown rice with shrimp but decided to try something new. It was worth it. I would try that again. There fish tacos are also very good. Overall great food and service...

Great place to take kids for pizza. They have individual tv screens at each booth to keep little ones entertained. I usually get four cheese or margarita pizza. Both are really good and remind me of New York pizza places. They also have Mediterranean salad and chicken shawarma which are great if you are not into pizza that much. Mediterranean salad has lots of fresh cut fruits and is always very crunchy. Great for low calories but very tasteful dish. Would definitely recommend it. Look out for deals on groupon for this place!!!

Ordered things for kids menu... After waiting 40 min server told us that we did not order any such thing and kitchen is closed... After spending huge amount for table still have to look for McDonald to get kid his meal... Server needs to pay attention and repeat the order because she writes anything she likes... Also mixed up chicken corn soup to vegetable soup...

First time I heard about this place it has just opened up. I got a groupon and took my son in a Sunday lunch. We ordered two dishes. My son got chicken and beef platter. I got leg of lamb. I absolutely love afghani kabuli pilau. They made it perfectly. Only place I had this better was in Fremont California where they have 5-6 afghani restaurants within couple of blocks (mini afghan area).  Service was really great and attentive.  I came back few times and was impressed every time. They seem to be doing deliveries too. I have used take out option too. Very kids friendly. Portion sizes are really generous and prices really decent. Best part is quality of food. Beef kafta is always moist and naan are tender and fluffy. You can't stop eating them when they serve them fresh. Must go if you like gyro and afghani food.

9 different combos for pizza and 3 different salads... If that's not enough then you can pick and choose... Choices of sauce cheese meats vegetables... I saw someone ping up a pyramid of meats before moving to next station... Brick oven and comes out in couple of minutes since the dough is already pre baked... All less than $8 each...wonder how they make money... Very professional staff

Great reviews:  https://www.facebook.com/gilbertfoodcourt/info  http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2015/03/best_things_eat_drink_phoenix_march_13.php   http://mouthbysouthwest.com/2015/03/11/gilbert-food-truck-food-court-to-have-30-trucks-for-grand-opening-of-new-site-friday/  from their website:    Do you remember that one EPIC party from high school? The one everyone is still talking about a decade or two later at the reunion? The one that started with a handful of people being invited and somehow 3 whole schools show up and there isn't enough food or room for people, the police show up to deal with the cars on the road and everyone who is anyone is there - even the MAYOR? Well last night the Grand Opening was exactly that!! And it was EPIC!! On behalf of the all the truckers, we humbly offer a huge THANK YOU to all that braved the traffic and crowds. It was an adventure - we had no idea it would be such a huge hit! We are constantly watching, listening and thinking of ways to improve this event. We had an awesome night last night and can't wait to make this week even better than the last! SEE YOU FRIDAY, GILBERT!!
