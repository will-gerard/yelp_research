My fiance is from Texas and when he moved here to be with me I was so sad that we wouldn't get to have any Kolache's anymore.   HOWEVER, he is so amazing and found this location. We went less than 24 hours after we heard about it and it was soooooo AMAZING! We will go back and I'm glad I found my Texas favorite in Arizona. :)

I normally do not take the time to write reviews for companies but this company deserves one. Wait, let me correct that, Russell Warren deserves one. The overall experience was great! I loved my massage and my massage therapist was nice and helpful. When I came into my appointment I told them I had previously booked one for 10:45AM at another location but called and left a voice mail to cancel it the night prior before I booked the 9:00AM appointment. I confirmed with them if it was cancelled (because if wasn't I would have went to the other location). I assumed I was good to go and one salon would communicate with the other since they said "Yes, your appointment was cancelled." Alright!  THEN, after a relaxing message I was on my way and received 4 calls from Russell Warren. I thought maybe I left something at the salon and he was calling to tell me. NOPE! I get a man on the other end asking if I would make my 10:45 appointment. I told him I went to my 9:00 and that I left a message the previous night AND confirmed with the front desk that my other appointment was cancelled. He then started to babble about how he has had such low prices for who cares how long and that he would charge me for a cancellation fee. I told him, "No, someone confirmed it was cancelled." He then said, "I don't know who told you that." WELL, maybe you should have a better communication system set up. Regardless, it is NOT the customer's fault that your 2 locations did not communicate. The call continued for another 30 seconds where I could not get a word in and finally I hung up. I had set up my services to reoccur once a month at minimum and was going to tell my co-workers in the East Valley about it. However, after his stalker calling, degrading tone and unprofessional-ism all I will continue to say is the truth about this day spa, it's HORRIBLE! I feel so sorry for his employees! If he treats customers like this, imagine how he treats staff.   I will never return and hope he gets reported to the better business bureau.

Queen Creek Cafe is a nice quaint restaurant. We have tried their breakfast and dinner. Breakfast was good. Dinner was great. I had their bacon cheeseburger, and it was very good. My husband had their all you can eat fish fry (catfish or cod) and he was in heaven. If you're ever looking for a charming family owned restaurant to eat well and put your money back into your community I definitely recommend this place.

Affordable, quick and sooooo good. The waitor was even nice enough to explain the type of soup I was ordering and asked if I was trying to go with something more meaty. If so, he recommended a different bowl. Thank god he did because I almost order something I didn't want! Great service!!!

This used to be my favorite Chinese food place. We even ordered there on Christmas last year.  I went here tonight and waited a good 45 mins for my food. The people in front of me and to the left me got their food before us. We waited :45 mins and my son kept complaining he was hungry. At the :45 min mark I asked to cancel my order so I could feed my son elsewhere. Granted, they were busy but why are the orders being served out of order? When the owner came and asked why we can't wait longer. I said my son was hungry. She said just, "ok" no sorry... Nothing. So, we were leaving, a rude lady to the right of me said, "they didn't wait that long." The OWNER replied with, "oh American restaurant, 2 hour wait, no complaints." WOW! You had loyal customers- not anymore!!

Let me start by saying I won I gift card here a few months ago at an event in San Tan mall. I was so hesitant to try this place, because the name just sounded too ritzy for my taste.   Moving on to my experience at Brio. Walking in the door we were greeted by a very nice hostess. Our waitress Bernice was great! Very nice, helpful and attentive (without being annoying). She was very well informed on the menu items, and even split our entr√©e onto two plates so me and my husband could share without us having to ask. The waiters and waitresses were all very nice and helped each other throughout our meal. The atmosphere was very warm and inviting.   The food was impeccable. We had the lobster bisque and it was the perfect blend of flavor and texture. Our main course was the Chicken Milanese, it was amazing. It is similar to what most people call chicken Parmesan only a lot better. Every bite was tender and juicy chicken.   For dessert we tried the carrot cake and the mascarpone cheesecake. Let me just say it was heaven in my mouth. After eating from that other "cake factory" last night. The mascarpone cheesecake here was better than theirs. This place is a great place for a date or a quick cappuccino and desert. I highly recommend it to everyone to try it at least once.

My favorite pizza place around! This place is so good my 6 year old son said, "this is my favorite store!" Meaning he loves the food here. lol This sounds crazy but my mom is Asian and she love this place. This is saying a lot since she doesn't like a lot of Italian food.

Best dentist I've ever had. He's very friendly, staff is always happy and I hardly have to wait. He does well with my 5 year old son and my son is now excited to go to the dentist. They even have a play area for him! don't care how far they are - I will only trust my smile to him!

Great & affordable lunch specials. My mom is Asian as all get out and said it was her favorite Chinese food place. I'm glad I have a good Chinese food place so close to me. I recommend the cashew chicken & shrimp low mien. The sweet & sour anything is great too!

We finally signed off on our closing papers last night  and we are officially homeowners thanks to Go Clean Credit! After the first few months with Dawn my score jumped up almost 100 points! Dawn and her team were hard working before we picked out out house and was rooting for me during loan approval process. What they do for people is truly life changing. I never thought I could get approved for a house with my credit. They made that possible. From day one Dawn communicated what her team could do to help rebuild and restore my credit. She's knowledgable with multiple states too since my husband is from Texas. This is one of the proudest moments of my life and I'm glad to say they were a part of that. I recommend their services to all my friends & family.

After being a loyal customer for years we've decided to cancel our services moving forward. Their tech broke a vase the last time he was here and I brushed that off. Then they changed our services and didn't even call to ask but tell us they changed it. Fine, I guess. Then, they don't show up for their appt time they scheduled! I called and left a message.... and no return call after 24 hours. I call to speak with the manager and she said "no one was home." BS! I have a newborn and was waiting for them to show up. I cancelled my services and all I got was a "fine". No I'm Sorry, hate to lose you. Fine. I'll take my business elsewhere and stop referring friends and neighbors to you!

The only good thing is the service was decent. The food is way overpriced and the flavor is off. For someone who is counting calories, I chose BLD as my cheat meal. I'm so mad I wasted the calories & money. My chicken and waffles was bland, the chicken taste likes nothing, literally and the eggs are the same story. My husband's plate tasted like onions with some steak on the side (he hates onions and was not told it was on the fried steak). We both agreed McDonald's has better tasting food. The mimosa tastes like cheap champagne. I will not be back. A tip for the chefs at bld, don't try to recreate the wheel. At this rate you'll be wanting to sell square wheels, figuratively speaking. You're trying too hard to make your food look good, and it tastes pretty horrible.

I didn't want to use this company but Liberty Mutual sent them to us. Originally my ETA was 89 minutes, wow! Ok fine, we waited. Then, they were 15 mins late from that 89 min window. I called both the company & LM and was told "the driver will call you in 5." Ok... Nope no call. Finally called back LM, "driver is running late he will be another 15 mins but he will call you in 15 with an update." Grr, ok fine. That 15 mins rolls by and I called AGAIN, I've been waiting over 2 hours by this point. This is where it gets good...   I call the towing company and they say they no longer have an ETA and can't get a hold of the driver. WHAT?!  They asked to please give them 5 mins to call back. During this 5 min window, the driver calls us finally to say he's 17 miles away and will be another 30-45 minutes. SAY WHAT?!   My husband takes the phone and says we've been waiting over 2 hours and have a newborn baby at home waiting. He then says to us, "well maybe you should pay real money then" Excuse me?! I'm paying out of pocket for this tow and my insurance only covers a portion. He then continues to swear at us and say since we aren't "paying them" that we keep getting bumped! Then we tell him to forget picking up the car and he threatens to take it any ways and "take it somewhere." After a good 2 minutes of yelling my husband finally hangs up on him. We call the company who hangs up on us twice and then says the "owner will call us". Yeah right...  I reported this company and its unprofessional behavior to my insurance company. If you're in the same boat call your insurance company and ask for another company to tow you. Quality towing took over and brought our car home safe to us within 15 mins of crap issue. I WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY and I've told every social media outlet I can to spread the word. I work in customer service and have NEVER imagined such a horrible employee can treat their PAYING customers like this. Looks like this is trend too based on all the other reviews.

Michelle has always helped with our fosters or rescues. We had a foster who was starved and had no hair. She recommended some product and cleaned him right up. I recommended them 100%!

I had a bad customer service expensive at first and wrote in with a compliant. The director of operations by far fixed it for us. We played golf for 2 hours, the food was great, the service was friendly and fast. It's not a cheap date but a much better date than dinner & a movie!

I have rarely experienced the excellent flavors and quality of food that Rhema's has. Rhema's IMHO is hands down the best in QC, and one of the best period in AZ. Great food, friendly services & did I mention great food?! I recommend this place to you & your momma!
