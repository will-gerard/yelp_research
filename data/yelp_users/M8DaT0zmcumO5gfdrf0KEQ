Word of advice stay away from this walmart. First off the check out line wait is like 30minutes. Then nothing is put in the right spot then all the worker seems upset to help you.  Its crazy and just the ppl there in general are crazy. Just walking to the store ppl ask you for money or try to sell you something. Crazy crazy place.

The food was overpriced for something you get so little of and the food tasted like it was frozen not fresh. Service wasn't great but there was only one guy doing everything. Of course everyone has their own opinion. This is mine

After searching for a place to repair my Asus Rog, I found this place with good reviews and decided to give it a try,  I came in and explained my problem, (clicking noise) they knew right away what it was, told me it's possibly a hard drive problem, told me the prices up front,  but said they'll do a free diagnosis on it to double check and call me to confirm, they called a few minutes later and told me it was the problem and asked if I wanted to proceed with fixing it.  It only took them a day to fix and at reasonable price. I'm happy to have my laptop back and highly recommend this place.  ^_^

I been here a few times now and I love this place. Everyone is nice and cool, they help inform you on things you need to know, the  flavors are amazing, they care to know about you and treat you like family. I brought my rsst in and Alex helped my set it up and gave me hints and tricks on how it works. Been here three times this week already lol. Love this place and will keep coming back. I go there just to hang out sometimes that is how cool it is. ^_^
