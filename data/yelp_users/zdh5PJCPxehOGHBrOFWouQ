Fritter me timbers....   I mean, corn fritters.   Not that this one little review makes any difference, but if you go, get the corn fritters.   This was my second time at Wild Thaiger and how that delicious app eluded me the first time, I will never know.   Not the biggest fan of their Pad Thai, but that's okay. There are many other very delicious options... And corn fritters.

I love getting the sliders! The food is delicious!  It can be a little cramped when they are busy, but over all it is a great experience!

The last few times we have been here have been less than desirable. I think we have finally decided to give up on Arcadia Tavern.  The food is a little over priced, and the service is questionable. A little too much attitude being thrown around. I recommend sitting at the bar or on the patio if you do give it a go.

I LOVE Hula's. I also highly recommend only coming to the Phoenix location. Great vibe, the patio is nice and dog friendly. The servers are fantastic, Keith is my favorite, hands down. On our last visit there, Soupy was EXTREMELY nice and made up for the terrible birthday experience I had at their Scottsdale location. Get the blood orange martini on the rocks and the spicy thai chicken bowl, you won't be disappointed. `

While I appreciate the excessive concern about my leather, my floor mats, my dash, the cup holder and the microscopic chip in my window... (Which I am still convinced is just a reflective, smashed bug) No, means, no. Just because I said "No Thank you" doesn't mean try harder. I just wanted my car washed. I don't want to be harassed more then when I went to go buy the thing. We all have to work and hustle, but can you tone it down a notch?   That being said, I wasn't displeased or please with the outcome of my car, I was meh. I probably will be a little less lazy and vacuum the dog hair out myself next time, rather then pay $25 for sales anxiety.

Due to my animal loving nature, I've been to a lot of veterinarian visits.   I spontaneously decided to add an adorable lab puppy into my two cat, one American eskimo dog mix. Which meant, shoe loss, puppy shots and diarrhea. Bailey is silly, rambunctious and tried to leap onto the counter multiple times during our first visit at North Kenilworth. In her defense, the delicious treats were on the counter and she was only 9 weeks old. Our second visit involved less leaping, a pretty offended look at having her temperature taken and an adequate amount of treats.   These doctors are kind, understanding, funny and extremely patient. The pricing is very reasonable and I don't leave with depression of dropping a months salary on vet bills. We will continue to visit North Kenilworth as long as they accept the leaping lab!

I have had numerous spray tans, ranging from orange and catastrophic to so-so and they wash off in a day or two.   Lindsay's has BY FAR been the best spray tan.   I made sure to exfoliate well the night before with some Strawberry Hedgehog scrub, and lotion up so my skin was nice and ready.   I didn't end up with orange thumbs, weird ankles or splotchy feet. It's fading beautifully as the days go by, and has lasted through sweat, tiger balm and shaving.   I highly recommend her for tanning, regardless of if you just need a little glow, or you are getting ready for an event, or your wedding!

I love Strawberry Hedgehog!  I have been given the curse of sensitive skin and extremely vicious allergies, so I typically have to monitor what sort of scents, ingredients and products I am using.   Tracy makes the most excellent and delicious smelling products. The best part is they are Vegan! No questions about which 562 chemicals you are washing yourself in the morning, because these babies are au natural.   You can order online or pick the goods up in Whole Foods!

I really wanted this to be great, I was looking forward to going...  I love the building..  We go in on a Tuesday night, it's not too busy. The hostess was immediately available, and asked if we wanted to sit inside, outside, high top, low... So far so good... And then bam... Screeching halt to the good experience. One of the disgruntled servers rudely stops her from seating us, to gripe at her about a small group that was waiting outside. (Mind you, there are plenty of open tables) He actually took the menus from her, and sent her away to go clean off a table outside!! He was standoffish, and had no idea where to seat us because he interrupted the hostess from doing her job, so he takes us over to a dirty table, so we can stand there awkwardly while he cleans it off, seats us with no menus, and not another word. BAD FORM TACO GUILD.  Our actual server came up, and was apologetic, offered us an appetizer on the house, which was a very nice gesture, and you could tell he was trying to make up for the debacle that we dealt with when we walked in. The meatballs, are interesting, the duck and steak tacos are delicious, but ultimately, the food isn't good enough to cover up the half a** service and the unusual mix of country music and old school hip hop that is playing...

I definitely have to say how grateful I am that this place is down the street from where I work.   The smoothies are tasty and I definitely have enjoyed each one I have tried.  It gets a little busy at lunch, so I try to swing by early to beat the crowd.   It would be great to have a count of ingredients/calories that way you know what you are consuming.   The only downside I will say, is that I understand customer service can be a little stressful, especially in a rush, however, I am paying $7.50 for a smoothie, not the attitude I get because I asked you if I could possibly add more banana into the smoothie. Whoever is at the register is generally hit or miss, some days you are a huge inconvenience and others you are the best thing that ever walked up to them!   That aside, I highly recommend.

So glad that Pizza People is open!   The truffle mac n cheese with chicken is my favorite so far.   We can't get enough of the place so I feel confident we will have the entire menu sampled in no time.   Pricing is so reasonable and the food is delicious!

I am a big fan of Hula's Phoenix, and we came to the Scottsdale location out of convenience because we were celebrating my birthday nearby and decided on dinner here first since Hula's is my favorite.  The service was weird, there is no other way to describe it. It didn't have the same welcoming vibe as Phoenix and we had to listen to a strange explanation of why our table was actually for someone else but now we are sitting there.. blah blah.  The spicy thai chicken bowl was GROSS. It had shredded lettuce in it instead of cabbage, I am not even sure why hot lettuce would be a substitute.   The only upside is that the restaurant is very nice on the inside. Other than that, we will stick with Phoenix.

I am extremely grateful for Wellness for Less, and for Cindy Steel. With insurance, without insurance, I come here for my health needs. Especially in the event of needing some urgent care. Very professional, very friendly and very affordable!

Okay, okay... It's not Gallo anymore.. I was heartbroken, too.   I had my reservations about going here, due to the spotty reviews and everyone saying it just wasn't the same...   It isn't the same.. However, it wasn't awful. The main thing I miss about Gallo was the shrimp and grits, and the fried cheese thing, but hey, I can burn cheese in a pan at home. So out with the old, and in with the new.   Downside: The bar area with the black walls, DEPRESSING. Put some artwork up, it's a bar, not a funeral. Also, the bar tender could try to smile once in a while, if your job is that awful man, don't do it.   Upside: The fish torta, my new favorite, and I really love the El Jefe, so grumpy pants bartending gets a few extra points because that drink is outstanding...   So give Tranquilo a whirl!

The BEST customer service, what a great experience.  We were running a little late for our reservation so we called ahead to let them know since it was a busy Sunday and we didn't want to hold anyone up.  Despite being late, we were sat immediately and the hostess even thanked us for calling to let them know that we were running behind. Our server was fantastic, she had a great personality and a good sense of humor, I was nursing a hangover and she helped get me fixed right up.   I highly recommend the strawberry scone and the breakfast chimichanga.   Attentive, courteous and tasty!

I have been to Central Kitchen twice now.. The first time our service was definitely lacking, but let's chalk it up to being new and I am sure there were some kinks to work through. Our server seemed extremely overwhelmed.   Second time. Our server was so great she could have convinced me to order one of everything off of the menu. She was extremely enthusiastic, personable, and very funny.   The pretzel bites are too good to pass up, we even kept the cheese to dip our fries in and we love the brownie!
