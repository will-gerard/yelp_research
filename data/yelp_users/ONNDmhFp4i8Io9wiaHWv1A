Ok, first of all, when I got there this morning to pick up my lunch,  the guy behind the counter was hitting on the gal in front of me so hard.  He spent all of his time and smiles on her that by the time he got to my order, he had not an ounce of friendliness left.  He acted like he was doing me a favor, begrudgingly.  That in itself is nothing, I have lowered my expectations of customer service since this new generation of pimple popping orgy addicts got their work permits a few years ago.  However, when I got the foot-long turkey sammi back to my office, the half I chose for breakfast had a little good morning suprise. (I just threw up in my mouth a bit.) They should change their slogan from "Eat Freash!" to "Eat Some Complete Stranger's Hair, Then Gag and Lose Your Appetite Completely".  I'll bet that is the real reason Jared lost all that weight.   Not happy Subway.  There is  a lovely Quiznos on Central and Camelback... They will serve my periodic sub sandwhich needs from now on. AND DON"T CALL ME MAAM YOU IDIOT!  And get your teeth cleaned! That yucky yellow stuff is called tartar and it can be removed.

Talley's is not only one of our neighborhood pubs, it has strangely good bar food.  There is a brand new juke box.  The entire place has been referbished in the last year or so.  They have TV's behind the bar, that super popular golf video game, and a pool table.  It's just the perfect little neighborhood bar.  The owner, CJ is a super nice guy who happens to be a good bartender.  All in all a great place to cab home from.

Loehmann's is where I generally like to shop.  I love the prices.  I love most of the clothes.  They have cute bags, hats, perfume... all kinds of stuff.  Unlike Last Chance, you won't find competitive boutique owners fighting over used goods just to take a seamrippper to the tag and add their own.  You won't have to deal with the smell of urine in the dressing room like Buffalo...  There are only a few privet dressing rooms but there is a huge changing area for those not-so-modest gals.  It's always a good experience.  And they give you the hangers to take home... It's the little things really.

My hubby works out on the west side so he will occasionally drag the whole family to some resturaunt he has decided is well worth the trek. Rita's is one of our go to's for completely authentic Mexican.  Rita herself is a classy business saavy gal from south of the border who knows her stuff and is a sweetheart to her patrons.  The food is muy muy bien.  Si es possible, triega una persona que habla espanol.   Or you can just point to the number on the menu.  Up to you.

Yes, I've always loved the "Chez Nous".  The old location on Indian School was a treat for my friends and I to hit up once or twice a month. Not by any stretch "regulars" but the band always recognized us (or pretended to) and made a special "welcome back" gesture, making us feel like we were part of their family ( second cousin's twice removed, but still family).  It always reminds me of that great scene  in Animal House when the gang went on a feild trip to a lounge . However,  Chez Nous crowds are entirely friendly, upbeat and fun.  "WAIT 'TILL OTIS SEES US, HE LOVES US!!!"  always plays in my head as I walk in.  They put the ramma in my shamma lamma ding dong. Yeaaaah. On a more personal note:  Chez Nous is where my husband and I got engaged.  The old one on Indian School.  So it holds special sentimental value to me.  I won't tell you the whole story, just suffice it to say my husband used the filthy carpet as an excuse not to get down on one knee.  Pfew... Ancient history.   So when I walked in to the new Nous it was with unrealistic expectaions and complete devotion to the old Nous.  It took very little time for the new Nous to win me over.  The Nous crew must have worked with painstaking detail and equal devotion in their hearts to resurrect the old Nous in the new place.  The look is the same, the energy is the same, the decor is the same, the band is the same... I'm telling you, they are like twins from two different Generations.  Kinda like Jan Brady  seeing an old picture of her great aunt and thinking it was her.  Except Jan has a cool new outdoor smoking patio and new carpet and Old Aunt Jenny is being turned into a Walgreens.  No, more like Jengo and Boba Fett. Sorry Jengo, I mean Old Nous... You won't be missed.  You've been cloned.  And the New Nous is closer to my house.  Peace out.

I've been going to Vision Quest for 14 years.  Back in the day, the people working there seemed more spiritual, more connected, and to be honest, nicer.   Now that they have the bigger place and more employees they've lost something.  Don't get me wrong, if you want it, chances are good that they will have it (unless you want various meditations, and then they won't have it and won't offer to special order it for you, and then the'll just walk away).  They have tons of stuff from every spiritual background.  The prices are a bit lofty but it is Scottsdale.   The most annoying thing is their readings are done out in the open on the retail floor.  I understand that is a good way of advertising your readings but it is tacky to me.  Tacky in the sense that those reading tend to get very personal and it's weird to casually chat about those things as people are walking by looking for the  Deepak Chopra section.  I personally was there when this  bubblegum pink neophyte was getting a reading and was practically shouting her responses at the tarot reader so all would hear the tribes ands tribulations of her love life.  I was praying for the manager to ask her to keep it down, but nothing was done.  There are signs not allowing children (the people most connected spiritually) under a certin age because they are trying to maintain a peaceful environment, but I'm forced to hear people's personal shit during their very public readings???  Bad form.   I'll find my books and stuff somewhere else.

Okay, I decided to go back to Vision Quest again.  I am so glad I did. The people they have working there now are wonderful. Everyone I spoke to was engaging, open, and truly connected. These are exactly the people one would hope to find working at an esoteric place like Vision Quest.  Great vibes, great service, great reading! Thank you so much! I really needed that.

I have heard of this place over and over for years, but since I really don't eat beef all that often, I had never visited... until yesterday. Let me just tell you, that friggin' Delux Burger is my new "GO TO" for premenstrual MEAT cravings!  Wow, it was a crazy delicious shot of iron my body needed. Honestly, I am salivating like Pavlov's dog just writing this review. Crap... now I'm starving.  Go. Get the burger. You'll thank me later.

I LOVE SHADY'S!!!  That's three exclamation points and five stars.  I love the jukebox.  I love team Justin.  I love Julie and Katie.  I love Erin and her love for Asta.  I love the regulars and the not-so regulars.. (except for that one guy.) I love "the drink to forget".  I love watching Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and The Army Of Darkness then I Am Legend all in one day with a yummy cocktail in my hand.  I love how JMV can be grouchy one minute and hysterical the next.  I love the color of Detroit's eyes. Aaah Shady's... I love how it makes you feel like you are a part of a community.  I haven't felt that in a long long time.  Thank you Shady's.

In this town when someone thinks metaphysical bookstore they typically have the big one in south Scottsdale in mind.  That place is okay.  As a matter of fact, I'll just yelp about them next... Lightworkers Gift is a little mom and mom (I didn't see any men)store in Glendale.  It has a great energy, the prices are very good, and they Have Dax.  Dax is the sweetest dog you've ever met.  Imaigne if Lassie meditated daily and was surrounded by crystals and incense.  Cool dog.  Dax is named for a character in Star Trek Deep Space Nine.  That bit of trivia helped me to win over the owners.  Thye love me.   Anyway, they do readings, they do spiritual therapies, they have psychic fairs and of cours, they retail a bunch of cool stuff.  They actually have privet rooms so you don't have people listening to your reading.  You also don't have to hear anyone elses.  I just love this place.  Well worth the drive.

I always forget how much I love this little slice of heaven until I walk through the unassuming door and voialla, "oh yeah, that's right, this place rocks!" It seems many more folks have found this hidden gem because they were super slammed at lunch today. Service was still friendly and fast! Winning!

I know I'm going to get crap for this but, oh well here goes... Starving, I go out into the vicious sauna that is Scottsdale in monsoon season, seeking food on a Sunday afternoon. After a couple of "closed on Sunday" disappointments, I decided to go slumming at the always-disappointing Schlotskys Deli on Scottsdale. Lo and behold, shiny new Capriottis and Everything Bagel swooped in to save the neighborhood.  Yay... No wait, hold my calls, I'm not done. I walk in and the place is about 85* in the restaurant... Yuck. I walk up to the register to order and asked the very pregnant sweating girl how long ago did they take over Schlotskys.  She rolled her eyes, looked down, and said "2 months, what would you like to order?"  I ordered. Then she asked for my name to tag my order.  I told her my name.  Another giant eye roll and a (fuck it, who cares) shrug. She says "I can't spell".  Because I don't normally care whether my name is spelled or pronounced correctly, even though, on this very rare occasion, I had pronounced it phonetically for her, I just blew it off. But then, right on the cash register screen facing me, was her spelling... "corney".  I laughed. She scoffed... "What?" She says. "I'm just laughing at how you spelled my name." Then she smirks and says "it works." And walked away without even looking at me. OK, kinda snotty. I walk down to where the food comes out, and the young dude making my sandwich is also sweating (no kidding)  and wiping the sweat off with the back of his wrist.  Whatever... it's Scottsdale. The other kid working was on his lunch break. I could tell that by how he blew past me full speed, across the store, clumsily juggling a plastic cup and skidded 3 feet to a stop in front of an available table to eat at, and plopped his ass down. I hope he chose something caffeine free.  Look, I know they're young, I know it's hot here, I know other guy is a spaz, I know she's pregnant, I can even surmise that she may not like her job, life, self... None of those things negate the fact that you (said employees) went out and got yourself a job in the food service industry... Serving others, food. Part of service is being polite. Another part is being professional. Where the f are the adults to corral these youngsters and teach them how to represent your business? Shame on you.  Oh, the sandwich was fantastic! Thank you, sweaty tall kid.

Is anyone else out there completely sick and tired of the plethora of Scottsdale restaurants serving mediocre food at hefty prices by an apathetic service staff???? ME TOO!!!  And that is why I am making the time in my crazy life to Yelp about a place that does everything right by their patrons.  Merci, at the risk of repeating myself, THANK YOU!!!! Thank you for taking the time to choose a soothing/cozy decor. Thank you for the extremely high level of cleanliness. Thank you for hiring a staff that is not only friendly, but as my fiancé put it "You can just tell they are kind people." Natalie and Kat are absolutely the nicest, most down-to-earth service staff I have encountered in a very very long time.  Thank you to Duke, the owner/chef for his dedication to his craft.  If you've ever seen "Like Water For Chocolate" you'll understand that you can actually taste the love he has for creating culinary excellence.   And Thank You for not charging appropriately for your amazing food!... I can actually afford to eat here. Yay!  This place has won my heart and has now become my "Treat To Myself" meal... You know the various scenarios; Bad day at work, Horrible menstrual cramps,  fight with your bf, zombie apocalypse nightmares... all the reasons you decide you want to be extra nice to yourself.  Merci is my new goto place which I am super happy about because my last "Treat Myself" restaurant is in Chicago... a mystical land far far away.  Sadly, the pictures I took of Merci are not loading properly. Sorry guys, go check it out for  yourselves!

I love this place... It is now 2:06 on Sunday. They close at 2:00 on Sundays. Two tables just walked in. Kat ran back to the kitchen and asked if the chef/owner could stay and cook for the two new tables. I've never seen a wait staff so eager to please customers. Duke, the owner/chef is staying open for those tables. These people really care. I love it here! And the salmon burger Rocks!

If you are looking for a big swinging Scottsdale Salon that, with the right lighting, could possibly double as a rave, good luck with that, and may your hair survive. If you really want to find a talented, veteran stylist that listens to you, cares about the health of your hair, loves her job, and has a great outlook on life, Carman should be your new hair guru! Her studio is so cozy and warm. I love the stylish decor so much... It kinda gives you a hug when you walk in and gently holds you while you get your hair done. She takes the time to make sure your hair is exactly what you want. Over and above her skills as a stylist, she is just one of the most down-to-earth, funny, loving women I know. I look forward to seeing her again and again and again! Maybe she'll let me clone her and I could have my own Carman to do my hair every day. Just spitballing...
