Lol. Quarter pounder with cheese and a big Mac. No lettuce. Drive through repeated it. 1st window repeated it. Last window repeated it. Too bad I still got lettuce.

Service was amazing. I personally love the Pollo Rico chimichanga with Machaca in it. The jalape√±o cream cheese on top was insane. Couldn't be happier.

I have been here a few times. Best az smoked wings I've had here. I like to get the sauce on the side because the flavor is soo good. The devil burger is amazing as well and they always have good daily specials. Good family place on the left side of the restaurant as well. One of my favorite food places in az for real high quality bar food.

Come on Thursdays. 50 percent off the wholr menu. The shrimp Diablo is amazing and there soup was insane. Everything very fresh. The menu is in Spanish but they were very helpful. Highly recommend.

Can't give it a 5 star because seemed just a tad slow on the service side considering how busy it was. Made me worry if I went for hapoy hour, but the lunch sashimi special and salad was amazing. Very fresh fish. Fair prices and atmosphere was nice on the patio. Will be back

Tried the lunch special sashimi with spicy tuna hand roll and miso. I liked the miso mix. The pieces were decent side. For 3 pieces of tun, salmon, yellowtail and roll for 13 bucks or whatever is not a bad deal. Going to try for a happy hour sometime but not sure.

So I'm giving a 2-star opposed to one the service wasn't that bad. Especially since it was a Friday at happy hour. He had a decent size group login and had a table at about 5 ish clock. She did not know happy hour specials for preferred not tell us because had I known that there were many specials like craft beer and appetizers I would have gotten food. Unfortunately I was not informed of any of this and just got a beer. Then I was not informed that happy hour ends at 6 p.m. opposed to 7 p.m. like some places and being 5 minutes late after happy hour I was still informed that it ended she did not check on us beforehand to see if we wanted anything before happy hour ended. So I can't tell you how the food on happy hour taste for how the craft beers on happy hour were because I was not informed and then not even allowed to get a regular beer after happy hour. Not a good experience will not be back
