I have to agree with the previous reviewer.  Dr. Clark is awesome.  Very nice guy who loves animals and who does not try to upsell you on anything.  I've been taking my dog to Orangewood for the past three years and I have nothing negative to say.  Go see Dr. Clark!

Average at best.  I have been here 3 times, primarily based on all the hype and wanting to be sure that I was giving Matt's a fair shake.  Listen, it's not terrible...but it's just nothing special at all.  The menu is basic and unimaginative.  I guess I would expect some creativity in the menu selections for such a "hot spot," but alas there is none.  The execution is ok, but not great.  I thought the hash browns were terrible (greasy and overdone) and the rest of it was quite ordinary, if not excessively greasy.  It's small and crowded.  The service was generally fine.  I also thought it was a bit overpriced...particularly the OJ, which I think was like $4 for a tiny glass of what seemed to be made-from-concentrate OJ.  Anyway, I think I'm done with this place.

Freakin' awesome!  I've been here about 5 times and am finally getting around to writing a review. Sorry, Tortas el Guero, and sorry to the viewing public for the delay. I've tried several of the tortas and have NEVER left disappointed. The bread is fresh, the toppings on the tortas are amazingly flavorful, and the salsa options are delicious. And the owners are awesome people who always prepare your food with a smile. Check it out!  Don't wait another minute.

Great work!  I contacted Garcia's Windows & More after some dirtbag threw a brick through my Arcadia glass door and stole all my electronics.  Mark showed up the same day and gave me an estimate, which was extremely fair.  It was a custom glass size  (of course), so it took about a week to get the glass in, but Mark showed up and got it installed in no time.  He was very conscientious about cleaning up all the shattered glass and making sure that I was happy with his work before he left the property.  I would definitely recommend Garcia's Windows & More.

Definitely recommended.  I had lunch here and found the food to be very compelling and the prices entirely reasonable. I had the chicken pho -- a giant, steaming bowl of savory goodness with lots of rice noodles and excellent flavor. Probably not as much chicken as there could have been, but it was tender white meat and it was quite delicious.  The pho ga was accompanied by generous amounts of all the usual sides - bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, lime, and jalape√±os.   The service was pretty solid and I will definitely be back.  All in all, a great find.

Great find!  I found myself down in Mesa for work and stumbled upon this cool little place. As a fan of empanadas (owing to trips to Argentina and Costa Rica), I was excited to see the sign and I made my way into the building. I had the lunch special - 2 empanadas, with a couple of sides. I had one chicken and one that had tomatoes and olives and chickpeas and a bunch of other stuff. Delish!  They also have agua fresca and a collection of local beers. If you ever find yourself in Mesa, check it out!

Just Ask Meghan is awesome!  We were out of town for about 11 days and arranged for Just Ask Meghan to visit our dogs twice a day. It was our first time using this kind of service, so we were a little apprehensive about how the dogs would handle everything, but they LOVED It.  Just Ask Meghan went above and beyond in providing their services and, in addition to feeding/watering and spending quality time with the dogs, they made sure the house was taken care of.  They brought in the mail, newspapers and even watered the outdoor plants while we were gone.  Very impressive and we will definitely use Just Ask Meghan in the future.

Great place!!!  If you're looking for a nice, comfortable place with excellent draft beer options, SIP is for you. They have about 20 beers on tap - almost all local -- and they rotate on a regular basis. And they have coffee/espresso drinks to keep you caffeinated. Live music keeps you entertained and the bartenders are, knowledgeable, super social and lots of fun. Stop by this local gem and enjoy a beer!  Open til midnight.
