This place was good back a few years ago, now everyone there looks like they are on drugs or spun out on something... I went in the ladies restroom and had to wait because there was one stall open and two dancers were snorting something together in there forever... Not to mention the bathroom was disgusting.  This does not feel high end, any club that does dances out in front of everyone is strange.  Don't you want privacy, hence the name "private dance"?? I was disappointed and ended up just giving the 300 in one dollar bills to the nicest girl there, a little cute blonde with long hair who wasn't cracked out looking and was also nice and friendly.  This place has gotten lazy... Get rid of the 30 girls in there with prison tats all over them, get rid of the druggies, make a better dance area/vip booths and then maybe your club would be the place to go again...

Though I have no idea about the food at this place, I am cheating! They have awesome bartenders and drinks and the best SONG menu in Oldtown!;). Tip the singer please! He rocks and you shouldn't be a cheap skate...! Not a good look!!;)

Walgreens is much more expensive for what it is than I remember in Nashville ... Also the pharmacy is not always on top of things... They used to have good food in the front cooler but now it's completely different and sad looking.  No more fresh salads and fruit... Also they can't keep bolthouse juice drinks in stock, quit carrying  English muffins:(. I don't know who changed everything but you messed up a good thing!  And what's the deal with never having spray Evian in stock??!!!:( I need it!!!  Drop the "naked" juice and please get more Bolthouse and the orange Neuro sleep drink!  All this being said, I love walgreens and probably am there every other day, it is so close and convenient!!! Just fix a few things!! I miss the walgreens about 6-7 months ago!!  Also you really don't have to tell me to "be well".... Some corporate nonsense?? ;) one last thing, it takes 5 mins to check out on your card reader... Can't you just do a simple version?? And have a no receipt policy! I hate receipts.  Waste of paper!

This place is slightly scary... Food in cases as soon as you walk in looks horrid... I got a veggie dish that wasn't horrible but I won't be back.  One vegetarian option only and the place just has a sad run down feel to it....

This is the second time I have ordered from this place.  The first time wasn't great... Pizza came barely warm and had way too much cheese, my cookie dessert was slightly burned but the ice cream was still cold and intact.  We also got the Carmel crunch cake, which came freezing cold, hence it was probably frozen to begin with but decent.  Since it was a first time order, I gave them a break.  I ordered the exact same thing tonight and was MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED... My pizza came so cold and had so much cheese on it that when I tried to pull a slice off, the mound of cheese stuck to the other piece and fell completely off... It looked like a congealed cold mess.  The crust is NOT New York style, it's just regular hand tossed.  You can't fold it like New York style pizza should... I thought for sure after the pizza drama that I could count on the cookie... Nope!  The ice cream was completely melted, it was just milky liquid.:(. And again a cold piece of Carmel crunch cake.  This place sucks.  Don't waste your money.  I couldn't even eat the pizza it was so cold and gross... Maybe if my boyfriend was here he could heat it up for breakfast because he will eat anything... More like "Streets of Domino's Cheap Nasty Pizza".... Actually I bet Domino's or Pizza Hut would at least deliver a hot pizza.... Get it together folks.

There are a lot of strip clubs in the area but this is by far the most fun and cool spot for sure!  The dancers are all super hot and sweet.  They don't harass you for dances every 2 minutes, however you should get a dance if you go in a strip club... That is just rude to come and only look!  Guys, don't be cheap! Hahaha. They have a great bar and the club is very nice.  You can tell it was remodeled very recently, and there is also a concert venue here!  Much better than Skin and Babes where all the girls looked like they had been on meth for years and at skin I couldn't even get to the bathroom because some dancers were in the ONLY stall snorting something... Umm yeah, no thanks!  Elite is clean, new, and the girls are all pretty and very sweet!  Highly recommend!  Also they are open after hours until 5am.  This will be my go to spot for strip clubs from now on!

I ordered from grub hub, this place has amazing food!!! I got my order very fast, great burger and hot fries, the apple pie was absolutely perfect, and my cookies and cream milkshake was on point.  AND IT WAS DELIVERED!;) yay! I will definitely be ordering again, I would give five stars but one thing really annoyed me, this is sort of a huge pet peeve of mine... If you are making a hamburger for the love of god please get a bun that is bigger than the burger!!! I hate it when the burger falls off the edge and you end up just eating half a burger patty... Other than that small criticism, I loved everything.  Oh, hunts ketchup is kinda gross though;)

This is not the place for Italian food.  It is a pretty generic Americanized Italian food chain joint but if you ever want Beignets, come here and order the zappolis... They call them Italian doughnuts but they are basically just beignets with chocolate dipping sauce and are great!  Other than that... I sat at the bar and the bartender was super sweet and nice, his name?? but the check said "khutso C."  Sooo, I think his name may have been Chris?? He was great, the staff at the bar were very friendly and cool but there were two guys at the door when I came in that had an attitude problem... I walked in and said I was going to the bar and they stood there looking at me like "whatever!"?? I mean... Come on, they didn't even have to seat me, thus do their job, so what was up with the shitty looks?  While I was waiting I tried the crispy asparagus app and it was good except it came with this heavy sauce.. I asked for balsamic instead and it was much better!! Also I have to say they had no problem with me using my small vaporizer at the bar and Chris and the other bartender even complimented me on it;) love a vape friendly bar!! All in all, for a chain the bar is great but if you want Italian food this isn't the place... It's like any other national chain, pretty Americanized!  Chris and the other cool bartender should be working somewhere high-end, they were the best part of the visit!;)

I am not really an Aveda fan and this is an Aveda salon but the stylists do a great job and it is super cheap compared to some other salons around... I only wish that the Scottsdale location offered nails or at least lash and brow tint... I don't understand why they don't and it's a pain to drive all the way to Tempe when this location is 5 min from my house!!  Go to Kaitlin at the Scottsdale location! She's awesome!;)

This place is great for when you want something fast but don't do fast food!  It had a 50's diner feel to it, really nice employees and fast service.  The fries are freaks cut and fried in peanut oil which I really like, and the burgers come in two sizes so you can get a smaller one if you don't want a monster burger... But they have those too!  They also have just about ever topping for a burger you could think of...  No drive thru, but it's worth it to run in and grab to go or stay and eat a minute.  The music is loud and sometimes a little annoying depending on what is playing;)...   Just say no to crap like mcdonalds and come here instead!

This is a five star gas station for sure!! Better wine selection than walgreens, and cheaper.  Cold as well! Ready to open after a long work day;)... They also have a POST OFFICE!!!!! I can not tell you how happy this makes me.  It's full service!  So far there is nothing that they couldn't do the same as a regular post office, and the lady that is always working is sweet and really helpful!! This is a hidden gem for sure... I love their selection, love their prices... Love being able to get my mail done while getting gas... What more could you ask for???

This is now my go to spot in Old Town! Came in for the first time today and was alone and in a hurry... Well I sat down and ordered my drink planning on just staying long enough to eat and run.. Then one server sitting down the bar from me was making jewelry, Robin. She was so nice and friendly so we meet and she gave me 2 bracelets made while I was waiting on my food and had an awesome belt she made that I bought right there!! Be sure and ask for her if you like cool and vintage inspired accessories;) she's awesome! So after I meet her I am introduced to almost everyone working tonight, which I think is really cool and makes the visit much more fun;). I met Jon, who was so nice and welcoming also, I believe he is either the owner or manager, and my server was a super cool chick named Chi Chi I believe, at least that's what my recipt said!! She helped me choose what to order and I got the Relapse or smaller version of the build your own burger with sweet potato tots!;) AMAZING! One of the best burgers I've ever had, not too big, perfect for me and those who like a thinner, smaller burger! You can get big ones too! That's the awesome thing about this place, each and every sandwich can be made as the smaller version for us light eaters or huge for those wanting more! Great idea! I hate it when I get a huge thick burger and it's falling off the bun and just feels like trying to eat a brick... Not here! You choose between 3 buns, pretzel, wheat, and I believe brioche.... Wheat was perfection! I loved the peach margarita that my bar tender made, and we talked a bit and later she brings me a glass of what looks like a milkshake with whipped cream on top and says to try this and tell her if I like it... I was a little nervous because that can either go really wrong or really right, but it was great and sweet of her to bring me free desert;). It turned out to be a Fireball milkshake!!! I hate Fireball but this was really good! It was really nice to meet so many of the staff, and they were so nice and said I need to be a regular since I live walking distance away:) I think I will do just that! My favorite place in Scottsdale for sure so far!!

They have a lot of things normal grocery stores don't and a great wine selection.  I found most everything I was looking for, but they are small and were sold out of several items... Lots of bulk foods and grains, the staff were very nice and helpful.  I like it just not for things like paper towels, house stuff, etc. they didn't mind me using my vaporizer which was cool, I thought for sure I was going to get scolded!;)

This place is sooo good!! I've been sick and fresh squeezed juices and fruit bowls have been amazing:). I love the acai bowl and usually create my own juice mix or kid go for plain fresh squeezed Oj!  I also love the pbj kids meal, it's great for a light meal.  I'm not big on tofu and wish they would add some selections with just veggies... Also if they had a create your own veggie sandwich I would probably go get one everyday!!!  Please add some more veggie only options!  I love this spot, and you can also get it delivered on door dash which has been a life saver the past few weeks while dealing with a sinus thing!!

I love sip.  Best local coffee hands down.  Travis, the owner, is extremely friendly, Alex is awesome though I am sad he is not at the Sdale location anymore,(miss you!) and Austin makes the best drinks and is really nice to look at;).  Also the drinks are on point and the music is good, which is crucial!  Right now it's Sunday and we are listening to old school underground hip hop!;) you can't beat that!!!!  The decor is amazing...  I love all the repurposed pieces and have stolen some ideas for my place already.  Fuck starfucks, walk across the street!!!!

This location is much more convenient for me, as I live in Scottsdale!  It is slightly annoying to have to go all the way down to Tempe... The only negatives to this location: they do not offer nail services, lash or brow tinting, etc. which would be really convenient and save me from having to go to 3 places instead of more of a one stop shop type experience.  That being said, the prices are extremely reasonable, the stylists are great, and I have always been happy with my hair as I leave!  If you don't need all the extras and just hair, this is a great place for Scottsdale folks!

So this place is where I go when I don't feel like going to a local spot, like bad hair days or in pj's... You know, not hipster enough for Sip, screw it, Starbucks it is.   I thought it was super shady that they opened this location RIGHT after sip.  I mean, to hell with local businesses, lets plop a Starbucks down across the street even though we have 3 in the next 2-3 blocks...  Shade!!  Then they had the audacity to make it a bar type thing... Just like lost of local shops started a while ago.  This really is not cool. On principle, I avoid Starbucks when I can, and use it as a last resort, like when you are on a road trip and can't avoid Burger King.   Sip is right up the street and is better.  Starbucks is trying to keep up with all the new, cooler, local joints.  Hopefully this is the beginning of the end for them.   As far as the place, they always are out of all the bakery stuff and the drinks are very bland and boring.  Same as the other millions of Starbucks.
