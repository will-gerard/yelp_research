My husband and I always keep coming back! We're all about exploring different sushi places, but each time I find myself comparing it to RA and having a "Aw MAN!" moment, just wishing their sushi was as good as RA's. We usually go for Happy Hour in the afternoon for better prices on rolls. They increased their Happy Hour prices a while ago, but apparently that doesn't matter because I keep coming back because it's worth it! Also, I have to say that almost all of the servers are covered in tattoos, and that...is kick ass!

I'm updating my review...because...well, this is just disappointing. I've been a huge fan of RA for the past 5+ years. I just feel like the quality/quantity is decreasing and the prices are increasing. I understand it's a tough economy...but they just lost two loyal customers. This past time my husband and I went, he could have sworn the rice was different on the rolls (I couldn't really tell a difference but he didn't like it) and I know this is small to most people, but they don't have the low-sodium soy sauce anymore. We tried the regular soy sauce and just did a tiny bit, but it was so salty and overpowering, that we couldn't really enjoy our rolls. The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.

Torrid and I... Match made in heaven. More so on the jeans/slacks side. Considering I'm a plus size, it's hard to find pants, and Lane Bryant's pants fit like a granny. I've tried Target & Walmart and nothing fits like Torrid. Their jeans fit me like a glove. I try to buy Torrid brand because they're cheaper than the name brands they carry. I don't usually buy tshirts there because I'm smaller up top an can find cheaper shirts just about anywhere for so much cheaper. I love the girls at Fiesta Mall, they deserve commission!!

I'm very hesitant when going to nail places. From reading all of the scary stories of nail fungus and other horrible things happening because of not using proper sanitation, you can see why I'd be apprehensive. I've had my fair share of bad experiences, especially since everyone cuts too much of my cuticles and I bleed every time. My coworker goes here and recommended it to me. I made an appointment for the Brown Sugar Pedicure $28 and the callous removal $5. I asked for a more senior nail tech working that day and I got Twee. She was so friendly and sweet, did a fantastic job (no bleeding, yay!) and she took her time and was very detailed. I am going to go back next month before my Hawaii trip and get my hands and toes done with shellac so it doesn't chip on my vacation.   The atmosphere is very calming and soothing. There are no TVs on the walls, and the music is of a spa. Love it!

UPDATE:  They ROYALLY screwed up my nail beds. She filed SO much, there were deep red ridges in my nail beds and it really hurt. I knew what that meant, so I tested her and asked what those red lines were, and she told me it was just my nail regrowth and it's totally normal.  I can't believe she's telling clients this who don't really know. I'm now seeing someone else (Stacey at Just for You at McClintock and Warner) who has now been doing my nails for 8 months and my nails are healthy again. I contacted NailSpa Expose on Facebook (even included pictures of the damages) and the only thing they could offer me was a nail strengthening polish and a discount on my next service. You REALLY think I'll be back for another service after my nail beds have been royally f*cked up?  I will NEVER recommend this place. PLEASE research and know about who's doing your nails. If they have a current license, how long they've been doing nails, etc.

esert Sage is quickly becoming one of my favorite places. I like that it's mother/daughter owned. I am very adimant about supporting local small businesses. I went in looking for essential oils to burn in my home, and not really sure what else. She helped me choose oil and recommended different uses for it such as burning, putting on pulse points, adding in lotions and sprays, etc. Then I talked about my back pain and she recommended a roll-on balm that feels amazing, instantaneous relief!! They also have Spry, an all natural gum that contains Xylitol instead of Aspertame. I will definitely recommend Desert Sage to everyone I know!

Gotta love this place. I just tried Falafel for the first time in my life at Pita Jungle and it is AMAZING! I had the Falafel Pita and my waitress suggested I pair it with their spicy Chipotle sauce to drizzle on top. Their garlic mushrooms are to die for, and the cilantro jalepeno hummus is surprisingly refreshing. Not terribly spicy like I suspected. We went on a Thursday night around 6:30, very busy, chill atmosphere with a live jazz band.

I've gone here twice, and been pretty pleased each time. I love the Boston and Philly Roll, and my husband really likes the 911 roll. The edemame is pretty good, but I wish they had chunky salt instead of table salt, and it could stand to be a little crunchier/fresh. When they bring it out, it's literally piping hot...right out of the *cough* microwave. No, I'm not surprised that it's most likely microwaved, I'm sure a lot of us would be surprised how many restaurants microwave dishes (however, I'm not defending them. They shouldn't be!)  The first time I came here, I got the Las Vegas Roll, because whatever Sushi place I happen to visit, I've always been impressed with the different variations of it. This visit wasn't so pleasant. I had my husband try a piece too, and he agreed, that something was...off. I'm pretty sure they used burnt oil or burnt grease. Something. It was some chemical gone wrong taste. SO needless to say, I won't order the Vegas Roll again. It *may* have been a mistake, but I'm a little scared to try it again just to see.  We usually go on a weekday between 3-4 so it's dead (I mean DEAD, we're the only ones there) so service is prompt. I can't speak for everyone else on the hour waits.  Overall, for the price (happy hour sushi is $3-4) we will definitely be going back!

This place is my jam!   AJ does a brilliant job on my accrylic/gel fills every 3 weeks. I came to her with square nails and wanted almond (but just a tiny bit pointer) and the nail tech I used to go to would normally take 2.5 hours for a fill (and close to 3 hours if she had to reshape them) but AJ reshaped my nails, filled the accrylic, and painted with gel in 1 hour and 15 minutes! (and with a little neck & shoulder massage) She is quick AND perfect, and sweet to boot.   I came in the other day for a first time pedicure here and saw Phillip. I'm a nervous wreck when I get pedicures because everyone seems to cut my cuticle and make me bleed, but Phillip did a perfect job, and I'll definitely come back to see him!

My update on Elite Day Spa is ...  I'll still go there for pedicures. It's the best pedicure I've ever had.   Even though my nails look good there, my nail tech keeps slicing my finger open with her brand new file. I got over it the first time, but it kept happening. Tiny deep cuts like that are very painful, and it wouldn't be the biggest deal, except I have to go straight to work where it's very possible for me to get an infection with my profession.  So I decided to go to the other part of Elite where they just do nails, a few suites down. The first time was great! So I booked again with the same girl. The second time, she was running late and took me 30 minutes late and did a horrible job. She didn't file off all of the previous color, so with the negative space nail design, you can still see slivers of orange from the previous manicure. My gel polish also chipped and peeled off 2 days later.   I tried a third time and I wasn't happy because she didn't bring the gel all the way up to my cuticle, so when I walked out with a fresh manicure, it looked 5 days old. This is especially frustrating because my nails already grow so fast.  I'm now getting my nails done with Patricia at Dolce Salon and Spa in Chandler and she asked me how long it's been since I've had my acrylics soaked off and re-applied. No one ever suggested I do that at Elite. The girls just take super glue and apply it under my nail. She said that's because the acrylic and my real nail are separating, and water can get in and cause bacteria/fungus. So...Elite's first thought is to superglue it.   I've just come to the conclusion that a really good, attentive, and knowledgeable nail tech is extremely hard to find, and I finally found her (Patricia) at Dolce.

I haven't had that much of a variety here because once I find something I love, I stick with it. Hands down THE BEST gyro pita I've ever had. It's a mix between lamb and beef and the flavor that explodes in each bite is unreal. Great hummus, the best pita bread I've ever had. Thick and almost buttery in a way. Not thin or cracks apart at all.   I've had their calamari and that's more like a special treat for me, but it was amazing too. This is the best Greek food I've had, and I know the consistency of flavor and service will be top notch every time I order, which is mostly take out.  Oh yeah, and the Baklava? TO DIE. ;)

Now, I've only been here once, and from that one dining experience, I am WAY impressed. It's 25 miles away from our house in Chandler, but my husband had a gift card and we wanted to try something new. Just the atmosphere alone is inviting. The ceilings are very high with a loft with seating as well. I ordered a glass of Malbec which is always delicious, and then we ordered off the pasta menu for $12.95.   When my husband ordered his Spaghetti & Meatballs, the waitress asked him, "And what would you like to take home?" We looked at her like she had 3 heads! She explained that for $12.95, you receive a pasta to eat at the restaurant, and then you get to choose another pasta to take home with you. AND they definitely don't skimp on the portions, holy crap!   I had the Baked Ziti....if I had died that night, I would have died a happy woman. Maggiano's definitely impressed us, and it is very far away so it will be more of a "Special Occasion" restaurant for us, but it's definitely worth the title!

I always get the Kung Pao Chicken. I've tried a few other entrees that my husband had (like a Thai dish that was pretty good) but my favorite is definitely the Kung Pao. Fresh, crispy snow peas and carrots and not drenched in sauce. And the crab ragoons are to die for!

I went to Bar Smith for the first time this past Friday night. Friday nights = Sticky Fingers. We went there after 11pm, and it was pretty packed. The DJ played a good variety of music, and I especially liked that it wasn't all the hip-hop top 40 at most other clubs. Good mix of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, AC/DC, Nine Inch Nails, Lady Gaga, etc. Then upstairs on the loft was another DJ. Pretty fun considering it gets a little warm downstairs, and upstairs on the open loft it was in the 50's at 1am. Great place to dance to good music and have a good time!

I'm hooked to Lucille's. Good GOD!   Those biscuits and apple butter they bring out before your food...I could fill up on just those! We've tried their chili, shrimp, pulled pork sandwich, cajun chicken sandwich, and some great drinks like their Strawberry Lemonade (alcoholic of course) and Mojitos.   We've had great service every time, and I love the ambiance of the place. I've never been disappointed and keep thinking of when we can go back next!!

I've been purchasing my tires from here for years. I just got a flat tire today, had my car towed to Discount Tire, and they replaced it for free. All I had to pay was $22 for the new warranty on the new tire. Everyone there is so accommodating and I would recommend anyone to go there!

After working at Paradise Bakery for 6 years, I swore I would never walk in there again. Well, I still find myself addicted and visit the Ray/101 location about 1x/month. Too expensive for my taste (even when I worked there, I knew I wouldn't be in every day like some people because of the cost) Almost $10 for a half sandwhich/salad is a little absurd, but it is really tasty. I like trying out new or limited menu items, like the salmon Caesar salad (freaked me out a little that the salmon pieces were all shrink wrapped and just plopped on top right out of the plastic) but it was still good and I didn't get sick... But my all time feel-good sandwich is the Chicken Walnut and either the Fire Roasted Tomato soup, or the Southwest Caesar salad. Oh, and the chocolate chip cookie that comes with the sandwich. It can be swapped out with a different kind, but I thoroughly enjoy the classic chocolate chip. When winter rolls around, I can't wait to get a Ginger Molasses Cookie and a Chai Eggnog Latte....yum!

I've been here two times. Once on a Sunday afternoon with my husband (all you can eat sushi) and once alone on a weekday during Happy Hour. When I came alone for a quick dinner, it was packed. I was surprised that my rolls came out within 5 minutes. The happy hour prices are phenominal. One of my all time favorite rolls is the Las Vegas Roll, and anywhere you go, that's always one that's in the higher price range, anywhere from $9-12. It was $4.50 during Happy Hour! Woohoo! I got 2 rolls for $8.50!! I'm definitely a fan and the sushi is delicious :)

One word: TONY.   This man is insanely talented! My husband and I had only been in the Valley for a few years and were researching tattoo artists. Sometimes I find it best when seeing tattoos from an artist in person on a living canvas instead of in a portfolio. One of my friends has her sleeves done by Tony and I was very impressed so I went to him for my legs and half sleeve.  Knowing what Tony can do, I put my full trust in him and let him have a lot of free reign of the creativity. I feel like that's when artists truly flourish!   Everywhere I go, I get compliments on my half sleeve and when I say who it is, there's been quite a few people who've said, "Oh yeah, Tony at Lady Luck. I should have known!"

Yep, I'm in love! Suck it, RA!! I love this place because you can choose sushi from a conveyor belt while you sit. You can also special order an entree as well. I also love how the plates are each $1.50 or $2.00 and the portions are small (3 pieces to a plate) so you're not stuck with 8 pieces when you order one roll. This way, you can sample a little bit of everything. I got 2 rolls, edemame, dumplings (forget the actual name) and my husband got 4 rolls and the total cost? $15! Hot damn, we WILL be back!!!

Very busy (even at 3 in the afternoon) but especially at night. Great beer (according to my husband...his favorite is the White Chocolate Ale) Reuben sandwich is really good, but overpriced. And they charge 50 cents per side or ranch or honey mustard which is pretty lame, since I maybe use 1/4 of the cup they gave me. $12 for a sandwich and fries? I could accept $8 or $9. I will say though...if you DO go there...try the shepherd's pie. You won't be disappointed. I'll be primarily going there for drinks and happy hour.

Before we even ordered our food, my husband said, "We're definitely coming back, just for the customer service!"   Tony, what can I say? You can tell this guy has a passionate love affair with his restaurant. We were immediately greeted by Tony with a handshake and asked for our names. I let him know this was our first time there & we heard about his restaurant on Yelp. He brought free Garlic Knots to our table and was extremely helpful at suggesting menu items.  The pizza was very good, he made sure to check on us a few times, and even sent us home with free dessert!   You don't see an owner that passionate and that friendly anywhere these days. It seems like it's getting him far - that place was packed!   We will be back for more!

Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite restaurants, and the ambiance is great, whether it's for a quiet lunch or Happy Hour on Friday with the place crowded. The food is always outstanding, and the staff is so chill and laid back.  Try the Chicken Pesto pasty, and the Cinnamon Apple Pasty for dessert. nom nom!

My mom and I ordered delivery a couple nights ago. The man answering the phone was very friendly and accommodating, however it took a while to get my street address and credit card number right because he kept confusing the numbers, and I had to repeat it at least 2-3 times. That was a little frustrating, but other than that, it was so quick, that I was surprised when I heard the doorbell ring.   I like that some menu items (on the dinner menu) have a small and large portion available. My mom got the small and that gave her two meals! We got an order of Crab Ragoons (8 for $3.75) my mom got a small portion and I got a large portion, all for $20! SO much food, for a fantastic price.   I wish that their whole menu listed descriptions of the meals, what kind of sauce, what specific vegetables were in each dish, etc. Overall, great place, and if I ever want to order in again, I'll go here :)

I don't know if this Hon Machi and the one on Dobson and Ray are related, so if they are, the one on Dobson and Ray is amazing, so this is not meant for that location.  My husband and I went to this Hon Machi on Alma School Road, and there was only one waitress who was also the hostess, and there were at least 20 people in the dining room.   Need I say more? It wasn't the poor girl's fault, her manager understaffed her, and I could tell how frazzled she was. I've been in her shoes, and it sucks. But we didn't have the time or patience to wait 10 minutes for a refill on our drinks. We asked for a refund on a few rolls we didn't eat because the service was ridiculous. We paid the bill, left and will never return.   Who knows if this is how the business is run on a daily basis, but it only takes one bad experience. We definitely won't be back, but we'll definitely be going to the location on Ray and Dobson. That place never fails us!

We've been using EZ Flow Plumbing for almost 5 years now. We first used them when we purchased our home and gutted it. The kitchen was down to nothing but concrete slab and walls.  Scott came in and dug a trench from one end of the kitchen to the other because we wanted the sink to be on the opposite side of where it currently was.   They've replaced our hot water heater when it flooded our garage, and just recently, J.D. came out and helped us out when our front yard was flooded.   I'm sure they don't have to go into as much detail with my husband, but plumbing talk is a foreign language to me, and they're really kind and patient with explaining things to me and even writing down what they're doing and why so I don't forget.   We will never go to anyone else, and are loyal customers for life!

We came here and it was DEAD. Whatever, that was fine with me. We sat at the bar and my husband ordered a burger with peanut butter. Yes, you read that right. That's all it was - the pretzel bun (which are insanely delicious) with the burger and a hearty slather of peanut butter. Looked disgusting to me but he loved it. I got the burger with avocado, lettuce, tomato and onion. It was really good. The one thing I didn't like was the ketchup. I didn't enjoy my tater tots (they don't serve fries which I was bummed about, but my husband was ecstatic about). My husband didn't see why I was not okay with the ketchup but it tasted like they added beer to it. It was strangely ... sour. Hmmm...

I visited this place because I received a gift card from my parents for Fox Restaurants, and I've heard quite a few people recommend this place. We visited today around 2:30pm (definitely not prime time, so it was pretty dead) My husband got the fish and chips, I got the Pub Burger (with Havarti cheese and bacon) It normally comes with mayo and BBQ sauce, I got the BBQ on the side. I ordered the burger medium and it was so juicy and tender, the meat was just crumbling so easily (I can't complain!) We split the Chocolate Toffee Tart Pie...Yum!! Overall, we enjoyed the place. I have a deep appreciation for interior design, and I love how the place is put together.

If ONLY I had read these reviews first!!  Alex came out and looked at my hot tub for maybe 5 minutes (didn't take anything apart) and concluded I in fact, did NOT have a leak, but a few minor things needed to be fixed (a rubber 0-ring, a rubber  nipple on the PVC pipe in the storage closet). He said he could come out the following week and fix it for another $225.  So, when I went to pay for this inspection, he charged me $225. I replied, "Wow, that's expensive, you didn't even do an actual leak detection. Do you normally charge the full price of a 1.5-2 hour leak detection just for a diagnosis?" and he looked at me and said, "Yep." So I went ahead and ran the credit card, and when he left, I decided to call, and I spoke with Gayle through the main number.  After talking with her a bit, she told me that if someone comes out, doesn't take anything apart, and there is in fact NO leak and it turns out to be something else, they only charge $99. I told her what happened, and she didn't seem too concerned, she seemed a little confused. Since she didn't even know how to handle the situation, I just had to order her around and take charge since she clearly couldn't. I told her to only charge my credit card the $99, (in the end, she really did only charge me $99) and that she needs to speak with Alex, and he needs to lower the price of the repairs or I'm going somewhere else. $225 for a few rubber parts (he even told me I could get them at Leslie's Pool Supply and Home Depot) and a little bit of labor? That's ridiculous.  I later called back and she told me he would only charge me $175. I cancelled my appointment.   The fact of the matter is - HE LIED TO MY FACE. HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME ($126 worth) and if he did it to me once, he would sure as hell do it to me again.   Gayle told me these guys are sub-contracted out, so they make a percentage of their services. OF COURSE THEY DO, no wonder he effed me over.   NEVER trust these people. They are over-priced and most importantly, DISHONEST and will screw you over!!! They don't even deserve 1 star. They deserve 1 middle finger.

I have been going to Gary since he was in Gilbert 4 years ago. He goes out of his way to take care of my husband and I. He's straight up honest, no bull or shady schemes like a lot of mechanics. One time when I didn't understand what was wrong with my car, he made a diagram on the dry erase board to help me understand better. He has great guys working for him. Joey has been with Gary since he was in Gilbert & has my 100% trust when I drop my car off if Gary's not there. I refuse to go anywhere else!

SO glad a friend recommended this place! I don't have vision insurance, and I've scoped out a few eye centers for prices on eye exams and contacts (contacts are pretty much the same price wherever you go, but it's the eye exams that vary..a lot) I purchased the 3 year EyeCare Club...which means...for $99, I got a eye exam that day, and free eye exams for the next three years. Tell me where else you can get that screaming deal. The other two places charged anywhere from $118-$160 for the eye exam. And that's just for ONE.   I am so pleased with America's Best. The doctor was so nice and sweet, and she got me in and out in no time. I would recommend this place to everyone!

What can I say about Yogurtland? I'm in love!! They have so many great selections, even though I'm pretty boring and I either get some kind of chocolate/coffee/reeses cup blend or vanilla and m&ms. Very reasonably priced, a good snack costs me less than $2! I also love how they'll let you know which ones are low calorie, etc.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!! I've only had breakfast here, but I've had their bagels, cream cheese and a few pastries. Their bagels are top notch. Whenever my sister and mom visit from Tucson, we come to Chompie's and they stock up on dozens of bagels to last them until the next time they come up.   Since we ordered before 11am on a weekday, I got my breakfast (2 eggs, bacon and two huge pancakes) for $3.99. I checked the receipt and asked the waitress if that price was right because I couldn't fathom all that for $3.99.  I can't really speak for some of the other reviews as far as wait times, etc, because yesterday when we went for breakfast (about 10:45) we had good service, and right as we were leaving (probably 11:30 or so) it had gotten SO busy, it was so crowded we could barely get out the door. But that just tells me that everyone loves this place, I don't know why the overall rating for Chompie's is only a 3!

My husband and I were walking around downtown Chandler, looking for a new restaurant to try. We stumbled across Coach & Willies, a sports bar/restaurant with class. He got the Diablo Turkey Sandwich and I got the Reuben. Delish! He wasn't a fan of the skinny crispy fries but I thought they were delish :)  The waitress was really sweet and funny and easy to talk to. I will definitely be back!

My first time to The Sushi Room was last night & I was very impressed. Ordinary, "simple" rolls were $5-7 and the "Signature" rolls are $10-12. I got the Sunshine Roll & Wicked Roll. Delicious!! Very interesting and creative mixture of ingredients. So flavorful and I'm so used to putting wasabi on sushi but this was so distinct & flavorful that I didn't want to mask any flavor. I love the outside patio has seating as well as couches. Very swanky ;)

Hello, my name is April, and I'm a Chipotle addict.  I always get the same thing...one small soft taco with all the fixings and steak, a kids bag of chips (just the perfect amount without going overboard...because if I get the big bag I WILL eat the entire thing). The perfect amount for lunch/dinner without breaking the bank, always under $5. YUM!!!

This place is amazing! We've been visiting since the beginning and am so happy this place is expanding! Their burgers and fries are insanely delicious. The waiters/waitresses are always nice and I love how passionate they are about the beer, too.  For all the people complaining about "pretentious" beers...maybe expand your palate and world a little bit, then they'll be "amazing high quality" beers...a lot of those ingredients they've made sure to find in Arizona. Support your state and a local neighborhood brewery!

I dig this place! The ambiance is the main factor for me....rescued exotic birds, lots of lush trees and flowers, and a pretty cool rooftop patio.  I would agree with a lot of reviewers here - they need to refine the menu. I will say they did improve the menu in between our visits, but it still needs some tweaking. We're excited for when they start brewing their own beer, which I've heard is in the very near future.  Overall, I really like this place & recommend to my friends and clients. They're a new restaurant, so nothing's going to be perfect in the beginning, but they always look busy to me, so I'm glad they're getting lots of love & support so they can continue to grow and improve.

I love my stylist, Sierra K! Over the past year, I've been transitioning from red/blonde ombre, to all over red, and finally made the decision to go dark. After talking about what colors I was thinking of, and showing her a few pictures, she created a cocktail of colors for my hair that turned out exactly how I wanted. She gave me a trim and deep conditioning to spruce up these tired ends. My profile picture is the end result of her artistry. I couldn't be happier with my hair! :)

These two stars sum up my experience - "Meh. I've experienced better." The prices are very reasonable, we were actually stunned at a burger and fries under $7! But I'm assuming the quality of the food determines the low prices. We weren't too impressed. It was okay, I wasn't unhappy by any means, but I don't think I'll come back.
