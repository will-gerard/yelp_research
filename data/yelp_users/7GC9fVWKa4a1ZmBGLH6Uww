Recently went back with a party of 10 for a bday celebration. It was my pick, and I did consider how a party of ten could be a disaster in a small-ish, "we're just a hole-in-the-wall that happens to be really popular" place like WT. And sure enough, we arrive and wait in the tiny entry way for at least 10 min before being approached by anyone. In that time, a friend who had arrived early and staked out at the bar informed me that as soon as she sat down, she was told that she couldn't order food because the kitchen was temporarily shut down because they were too busy. At the time we arrived it was maybe 30 percent full, and she assured me that that had happened 30-40 minutes ago, so they should be back on track by now.  The host finally showed up and said she could seat us, but it would be a while before the server would take our order bc they were "recovering." Well, that's better than 10 people blocking an entryway, so I'm not sure why she seemed hesitant to seat us, even if we had to wait for a server. She assured us that we could order drinks from our table until the kitchen was "ready." It was only downhill from there. Thankfully, we were a jovial bunch - under any other circumstances this experience would have been disastrous. 15 min to get drink orders, another 15 to get the drinks. Another 20 min later he took our food orders. 30 min later they started coming out, sort of. Seven entrees came out, staggered over a period of five minutes. But three entrees - all pad thai - didn't arrive until at least 10 min later, when everyone else was finished. I understand not everyone can get food at exactly the same time with a party of 10, but they didn't even come close, and at the time we made our food orders it was at least an hour if not more after their alleged huge rush that shut down the kitchen.  I got the peanut chicken - grilled chicken with peanut sauce, rice and grilled veggies. The sauce was too citrus-y for a peanut sauce and too thick (funny that I complained in my first review that my curry was too thin). Chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant. Good thing it was only $10. Didn't get details from anyone else except the BF, who got the Kao Pad Jay, and kept saying over "I'm so glad I got this!" All these issues seemed to be circumstantial (except the chicken dish), but, then again, how long has WT been a restaurant? Come on, I'm sure they've dealt with many a Saturday night rush and someone (ahem, manager??) should have at least come out to explain/apologize for their issues. Don't think I'll go back to dine in - ever.

I've seen more than a few convention centers and expo halls in my travels, and who knew the coolest one was in my own backyard?  This is dorky - but I know you'll totally get me if you've ever trekked across countless useless square feet in heels, lugging countless brochures and promos you've been given; if you've trampled over mounds of used paper towels in a depressingly lit, dingy bathroom; if you've ever had to sit in a hard plastic chair for an hour+ and listen to a rumple-suited guy drone on and on about synergy and sales figures; if you've ever been subjected to ugly corporate art ... OK, I'll stop there - but I LOVED the Phoenix Convention Center!  With a swell new renovation, its gorgeous in contemporary rust and sand and other deswet appropriate colors (god, I'm glad Arizona finally got away from the "sunset" color scheme of pink, purple, orange - blech!) and fancy tile entryway. It's clean, modern and has TONS of windows and open space. When you enter the West Building from Second St (the entrance by Starbucks), you're sort of swept up, up, up to the sky, and it really makes a statement (the entire entryway/first floor is open all the way to the top).  The seminar rooms have all the hi-tech gadgets needed for presentations, and the AV/Tech guys were professional and prompt if there was a problem - and, might I add, some of the most well-dressed techies I've ever encountered. No band T-shirts, visible tattoos or bears* here, man, it was all long-sleeved button-down shirts and dress pants; impressive!  My favorite part? Wicked-comfy chairs in the rooms. No hard plastic and metal legs, no cumbersome, heavy, office-gray uncomfortable torture devices. The chairs were super sleek - those mesh-back, rolling office-desk chairs you always see in design studios and architecture offices. By the way, did I mention the backs *recline*. I'm totally serious. I'm a super antsy chair sitter - I sit up, I slide down, I cross, re-cross, pull my legs up Indian-style, under me, I turn (doubly insulting to speakers if the chairs are squeaky)... I can never sit still in an office chair, but these bad boys made me feel like a grown up finally as I could sit quietly for a full hour.  Bathrooms were incredibly nice - large-tiled floors that were actually clean, small-tiled sink backsplash in contemporary colors, soap AND paper towels in full supply AND the automatic water faucets ACTUALLY all worked! It's a convention center miracle! A full-length mirror for making sure your conference appropriate attire looks as nice as you thought it did at 5 this morning. Nice, floor to ceiling, all-glass (frosted) doors with the long bar, brushed steel handle (what can I say? I'm a sucker for a cool bathroom, just read any of my reviews)  What else.. it's right off the light rail, of course. I found the entrance easily, no wandering around an entire city block looking for the right door. Up on the third floor, the windows provide a great view of the city streets - p.s. what's with the towering TMobile ad painted right on the Bank of America building?? Oh yes, super hi-tech looking TV screens outside each room that display in color the current and upcoming sessions - helpful, because it never fails that someone moves or changes the signs and you're left wondering if you're in the right place.   Also, I liked that the convention center chose to work with a caterer who uses compostable plastic cups made from corn...say what?? And they have recycle cans alongside regular trash cans for all those empty water bottles.  OK, the one thing this place does have in common with other convention centers is that it is FREEZING. Of course, that is to be expected no matter where you travel.  **This is actually supposed to be "beards" but for the record there were no bears either

I'm not really sure what to say about a place that, seemingly, only exists to keep patrons waiting for pizza next door from gouging each others' eyes out in a fit of starvation. I can say I appreciate that they don't try to do their own gouging, price-wise. We had a one-hour wait at Bianco's, and as I walked over with my friend, I said, let's check this place out, but if every drink on the menu is $10 we'll just go across the street to Rose and Crown.  Thankfully, draft beers were about $5 and they had a good selection of local brews (Four Peaks) and imports (Stella). The wine selection had plenty of bottles but only a few options by the glass. They had apps too, that ranged from $5 to $15. We ordered the Goat Cheese Crostini ($5), which ended up being a rather small piece of toast but with a handful of black and green olives on the plate too. We split it between four girls and it was just enough to give us a taste without ruining our appetite for the delicious pizza to come. Though no silverware or plates came out with the app -- so we each had to really man-handle that piece to break off a bite. We all know each other quite well but would sure have been awkward on a date or with acquaintances.  Service was so-so. Nothing bad, but nothing notable either, except that when we gave the server cash and two cards to split the balance between, we realized he ran one card twice and the other not at all.

i am really happy right now, cause i just had round 2 of my wrap from that's a wrap!  but...Wow, i didn't realize how lucky i was to beat the lunchtime crowd here. I have been meaning to go here for several months, but like our first reviewer, can't go out of my way when during their normal biz hours.  but, i had heard so much about it, i like green so much that i jumped at the chance to stop by after a rare 10 a.m. downtown meeting. i got there at about 11:30 and there was plenty of parking (by plenty i mean only three of the lots 10 or so spots were occupied), but, even though i knew what the building looked like from driving past its closed doors so many times before, i still cruised right on past while heading south on 7th st. i went into the second entrance to the lot that wraps behind the building and oops! that's an exit only. i had to do some fancy manuevering and a 3-point-turn (haven't lost my skills since driving test '98 - woot!) to face the right way and get into a spot.  normally, i would be pretty annoyed at all this, but i was too excited to try a refreshing vegetable-heavy wrap on such a damn hot day. and that's a wrap! did not disappoint. while i waited for my companion, i looked over the menu and was surprised at how many of the items were hot or grilled. i was kind of heartbroken until i saw the daily special, chicken salad with avocado, lettuce, veggie mayo in a flavored wrap (all the tortillas are flavored, making the choosing process that much more painstaking).  once i had my order on lockdown, i checked out the art on the walls of this early 1900's house-turned cafe. not my taste (the subjects were robotic kind of monsters with drippy limbs, i thought of pink floyd the wall, while my friend likened it to what a 15 yr old metal head stoner doodles during class) although they had skateboard art, also, which was better. then i picked up a java magazine and flipped through it...basically, if you come alone, you won't look like a loser, there's plenty to keep you busy.  blah blah blah - long story short, the wrap was great, although on sides menu i chose "house chips" thinking they would homemade potato chips, but were just store bought tortilla chips. lame. friend got the pasta salad which was much better, i recommend that. plus, they cut the burrito sandwich in half and have bags and plastic wrap right there at the drink station, so you can easily get two meals (hence my being happy at round #2) and i was happy i didn't have to   a. wait in line forever just to get my wrap travel-appropriate   or  b. feel like a jerk and cut in front of everyone just to get my wrap travel-appropriate  now, i am sad because i probably won't be back for another couple months, but only because it's not closer.

Just went here last night for the first time after a visit to the museum, and it was everything I had heard and more - i was not disappointed.  beautiful historic home turned upscale-casual restaurant, in the style of Coup de Tartes or House of Tricks. It was relatively busy, but we were sat right away.  Mom had the BBQ chicken, BF had pork tenderloin (I'm not a pork fan usually, but this was melt in your mouth delicious and not overly salty at all) and i had the meatloaf entree (not sandwich, as advised by the young and very pleasant server).  we were all very pleased with our orders and service was prompt, professional and pleasant. the woman dining next to us came as a recommendation while in town from the owner and chef's cousin. she asked the server to let him know she was here so she could meet him and say hi, and after the crowd died down a bit, he did and seemed like super cool, down to earth guy.  i overheard him mention his "other restaurant" so on our way out i asked him about it. he was also super friendly with me and filled me in on Circa 1900 (which I've also heard lots of good stuff about). i will be heading there on my next dining adventure.  dinner entrees were priced between $15 to $25, cheapest glass of wine was $6 (not bad, the food was couturely presented and tasty).  p.s. the parking lot was a nightmare... all dirt and full of HUGE pits and deep tire tracks, but wouldn;t stop me from returning

I've been driving past this intriguing little place for years now, and finally stopped in to satisfy my curiosity. I had been warned by a friend that it was not worth going for lunch, as the food wasn't very good, but I was craving a hamburger and in the area, so to MacAlpine's I went. Once I figured out which door granted entrance to the diner (seriously, it took three tries),  I was greeted by some awfully pretty and very in-character waitresses. They were all dolled up, '50s style and had that sweetie-pie personality down pat. I admitted I wasn't too familiar with places that offer so many soda options and asked for a recommendation. The server gladly offered her favorites, and I went with her suggestion, a cherry cheesecake soda. It was fantastic. I looked over the menu and was immediately disappointed, why is a turkey burger featured above the all-American diner staple, the cheeseburger?! And no fries? I briefly considered the chili dog but that too was made with turkey ... what kind of throw back retro diner was this?? Damn. I got the cheeseburger and potato chips, which came out pretty quick and the burger was hot as all get out, fresh off the skillet ... definitely not a grill and that was just about the worst patty I've paid for in my life. Dry, flavorless, terrible. Well, I had been warned and can't exactly complain. Seeing as I'm not a soda drinker and wasn't a fan of the food, I won't be back. But the atmosphere and food quality would suit children well, and I saw several come and go, usually with their grandparents.

this is the perfect time of year to visit DBG.  in spring they start their spring jazz in the garden series (every firday night) with food and cash bar beverages. you can take painting classes, just stroll around, and now they have this awesome art installation piece made of twigs that you can actually go inside of (completed Feb. 23). i've been coming here since i was a little 'un and i love coming back. especially if you're a native, you'll love the "desert rain" ... machine? it's basically a strainer with creosote and other desert plant leaves inside, and you turn on the shower fountain head and get an instant whiff of true monsoon season desert rain smell...it's amazing!

As you may or may not have read in my profile, this was the venue where I attended my first concert. It was Tiffany - I was about eight years old, the opening act was a magician (oh, you heard me), and I spent the entire last half of the show crying in the bathroom because it was too loud.  since then, i've seen such awesome shows there as Modest Mouse, Fugazi, The Violent Femmes, and the Warped Tour. It has seating, but I've never attended a show where it was assigned or ticketed seating - more like grab a seat i fyou want or go down to the stage and stand.   did i mention the stage spins? pretty rad, so you never have a bad angle, and i remember for the modest mouse show being blown away by the fact that they had two drummers with full drum sets and watching them rock out close up for the first time really ever. the bar area and bathroom (where i hid out from the teenage screams of "I Think We're Alone Now" is in this downstairs basement type area.   all in all i like going there for more well-known bands that aren't huge. it's the perfect size to feel like you're still at a show, and not a mile away watching the action on a screen.

my boyfriend took me here on my birhtday after several strong suggestions from his coworkers for a nice, romantic option.  and i was blown away! if you've been to house of tricks in tempe, expect the same crowd, decor/atmosphere and price, and the same food quality.  it was a beautiful historic house with an outside deck. it was very tiny, and it gets a little loud with the small settting and hardwood floors, but not enough to ruin a meal by any means. we had reservations on a saturday, and still had to wait for about 10 minutes. during taht time we saw several groups come in without reservations and get turned away.   the BYOB was a killer surprise. my BF printed the menu from their web site and took it to AJs and asked the wine guy for his suggestions, and that worked out perfectly.  i have to suggest the brie brule, brie covered with caramelized apples and served warm with toasts and seasonal fruits. absolutely wonderful and melt in your mouth.  we also had mozzerella and tomato salad, which was overkill on the cheese, but still good. i had the filet mignon and he had the pork tenderloin and they were also unbelievably good.  i'm sure it was a hefty bill, but def worth it for special occasions. i will def go back!

Impressed on so many levels with this stashed-away gem in Phoenix. I had heard of Richardson's, and for my friend's going away/belated birthday dinner, he requested that we go to Richardson's "other restaurant."  Like any good yelper I checked its profile out and the peoples' who's opinions and tastes I've come to trust had me sold on it. A subsequent AOL City Guide review page was less than inspiring - complaints about them closing the upstairs dining area and diners who were less-than-impressed with the menu - they (the AOLers) came off sounding like snobs in their reviews, anyway, so I didn't let it bum me out, but I wasn't sure what to expect.  Based on the price range and what I'd heard, I was prepared for a 40s-60s married couple crowd and elegant/traditional dcor that would appeal to that demographic; this assumption was further believed when we pulled up and saw those exact couples leaving the parking lot.  However, we drove up (complimentary valet is required) and went thru a wooden door into a stone stair chamber (seriously, it felt like a secret passageway in a castle) to another wooden door that opens into the bar area (I was assured on the phone when I made reservations about three days ahead of time for the Sat night that we would get a table, or you can wait for a table or belly up at the bar to eat).  Anyway, the crowd was very up-and-coming (for reals, not like Scottsdale mall Kona Grill happy hour, "I'm in real estate" up-and-comers) late 20s to late 30s crowd, the flat screen TV behind the bar was playing ESPN and the Cure (!) was playing...I was in love. It was still white table cloth and wood accents nice, but the subtle, muted tv and just high enough music volume were enough to make it seem more like a bar than a stuffy restaurant.   I was told it was Dutch-inspired (so executed by the Dutch impressionist works all over the walls) but the food is basic "new American" grill faire. New twists on old favorites...along with favorites basic mashed potatoes (except these come out souflee style), bacon-wrapped scallops, prime rib ($32) and Chilean sea bass ($28? $34?) (all of which we ordered, and ate, and it was all excellent).  We also got a bottle of wine for $25 - not bad. That was one of the least expensive ones, it goes up to the $200s from there. Oh, we also had crme brulee (divine, freshly made with real vanilla bean and served cold, not hot) and coffee to top it all off. Whew! We were pretty drunk, very full and very, very happy with our experience. (the music selection also continued to impress, surprise me - The Killers, Morrissey  Oh! I can't forget the server...he was professional (not snobby), knowledgeable and helpful - he will give you his honest opinion on which dishes he likes and doesn't.   Oh! And, for a higher-dollar establishment, I was very happy to see they didn't try to charge for every little thing - for $32 I got a salt and pepper encrusted prime rib, the giant side of mashed potatoes, asparagus and a salad (you even get to choose from four specialty salads); a steal, really.  Ok, I'm done gushing. If you want a romantic dining spot, this works. If you want a nicer place to grab drinks with people who will appreciate the menu, the ambiance can't be beat.

this restaurant is so gaudy it's amazing.  plenty of Fat Tony types mililng about and chit chatting with the regulars, the food is unbelievably good...but it'sreally the decor taht makes this place awesome.  the bar area is an explosion of 70s disco era over the top glitz, with a long bar area that features a classic black and white checkered floor and full wall mirrors accented by neon lights that run the length. seating features tables with pole coming right out the middle, and if you come during the day, you will see sugar daddy's taking their pets from Bourbon Street (a strip club accross the street) out for lunch a field trip dance.  i had a friend who worked the bar here for years and oh the stories she woudl tell! on a side note, i also had a friend who worked at Bourbon Street and she had quite a few tales herself.  def go for at least a happy hour, check out the menu and atmosphere first to decide if you like the absuridity of this place.

the kids who work here are always good looking AND nice, a rare and appreciated combination. i steer clear two months before and two months after christmas, the line is too much. i did happen to go mid december to pick up a new ipod since mine was stolen (and by stolen i mean i got drunk and lost it) and they were churning them out like donuts. pre-packaged and ready to go, the guy-in-girls-pants who helped me could have checked me out using a hand-held credit card runner right then and there, but i was foolishly using antiquated cash payment method. do'h!

after two years of going to postino's and thinking every time, 'i have to try this place soon,' i finally lost my or-ange (pronounced "oar-ahnj"; i didn't know either until i caught one of their chefs on a morning news show, and i figured she would know) virginity on easter of all days.  on a side note, is it sacriligious to say "virginity" and "easter" in the same sentence?  i met a friend there at about 10:30 on easter morning, and, always timid about where i can and can't park in this DeMarco mecca, i circled around the back and got a spot close to the post office. despite being at the back of the long stretch that makes up the grocery, dining and gelato shops, i abided by a giant blue and white sign there in the back that tempted me to "Come In Here!" complete with an arrow. i pulled open the door and was greeted by busy, sweaty cooks in the kitchen, whom stared back at me. huh. i closed the door and read the sign again, making sure i didn't misread *deliveries* come in here. nope. confused and mildly annoyed and walked around to the main entrance.  the mini cafe/coffee bar patio was full and there were tons of cruisers parked along the sidewalk (no racks or locks, if you're planning on dining inside). seemed to be Wildflower style, as in order at the counter and try to fight for a table. my dining companion was an old pro and pretty much walked me through the whole thing (getting my attention to order when the girl came out to us in line way before we got to the counter [i was busy checking out a sweet vintage cruiser], picking up our food since they don't bring it to you or call out a number when it's ready, i couldn't even find the trash when it was time to bus our table). all in all i was very disoriented, and i blame it all on that sign! mentirosa!  now, on the important stuff, food was pretty good. all egg white omelette with avocado and fresh pico-style salsa was nice and light (not sure what happened to the side of fruit that was suppposed to come with it).  i got a bit of a funny/offended look from my dining companion for comparing the oar-anj to wildflower as far as clientle (which is the only reason i knock a star off). the best explaination i could offer his defensiveness at the time was that it was all the same kind of attitude, save for the upscale-ness of the oar-anj elicited a more "cool baby" snob crowd, while WF is more "suburbia" snob. basically, you just trade in the SUV soccer-brat taxis for a hummer or lexus or mercedes s class...all of which were lined up in a neat little row out front .  now that i've said all that, none of the above will stop me from returning. i think i would like the place better as a dinner/drinks spot than breakfast. the uber-tans and blonde streaks (sported by both men and women at this joint) were all too much to bear by the light of day. or i'm maybe i'm just still harboring resentment over that damn sign.

I LOVE this place, but I have to admit, it's really not a 'date' place. Well, let me clrify, it's not a good 'first date' place.  The converted post office has terrible acoustics and it gets REALLY loud in there. Unless you know someone really well, you might feel a little awkward yelling at them, or saying 'What?!' after everything they say. And, while the brushettas are AMAZINGLY delicious - i swear by the prosciutto, it is to die for - it is definitely not pretty to eat; capers flying across the table and gnawing through the crunchy bread like a rabid dog.  but, i love going there with good friends and my boyfriend. the servers aren't snobs and they will help you pick a bottle even if you just tell them, 'uh, i like red, yeah, red wine is awesome' without rolling their eyes. the crowd can look very scottsdale, but the attitude is not, so don't get discouraged when you walk in a see business men in suits and lots of tan legs and blonde hair. the menu is just appetizers, but i guess you can order pizzas from La Grande Orange (please don't call it 'LGO,' that's lame) which is right across the parking lot and owned by the DeMarcos as well. I've never had it but it comes highly recommended. oh! and they waive corking fees on monday nights, but other than that, i don't think they many specials- too bad.

I needed an oil change reeeeaaaally badly (i know, but i have a honda and those things can run on gas fumes for 30 miles and oil resin for months) and had had an OK experience at the danny's family on HIghland (free wash with a oil change, who doesn't love that?)  But. I checked the Danny's site and saw no promotion of the wash and didn't want to drive out of my way for nothing. i checked yelp and this Jiffy Lube had the best rating i could expect for an oil change place and was up the road from work. Downloaded the coupon (thanks for the tip, Kym) and was on my way.  Pull in and i tell the guy i want the "Signature" change which includes window wash and floor vacuum, mentioning my $5 off coupon. He said that they were already running a special that was $13 off the $35 price so i said a-ok, cowboy.   i wait for about 8-10 minutes in the small waiting room (bonus for having a Phoenix Magazine in the stack of Muscle Car Monthly, Oil Today and Antennas Weekly - look, just because i'm getting routine maintenance on my car does not mean i'm INTO cars).  I get pulled into the garage area for the "spiel" everybody dreads but it was surprisingly short and non-pushy. (i'm glad they don't drag you over to your engine anymore, that's totally lame). i do have to note that he tried to tell me my right front blinker, my left back blinker and my license plate lights were out. i had JUST gone to Checker to replace my left front blinker light and went through some extensive light checking and so found this news odd. i kept saying as much, and he kept insisting and i was about to ask to see for myself when he calls out to another worker "Hey, was that the honda with the lights or the jeep?" the other guy says "the jeep." however, there was no other car in the place. hmmmmmmmm.  OK, so i pay up ($24 altogether with a tax or fee or something added in) and go back into the waiting area while they finish up. I decide to use the bathroom -- and this is where the they lost two stars (this was, up until then, quite possibly a four-star experience - wait, two stars for a bathroom, you ask? oh, you just wait...)  the bathroom was filthiest thing i have seen in my life, and i've been to some raunch truck stop pee holes. literally, piss, in the bowl... i get in closer and i shit you not (pun intended) four shit smears in the bowl as well (yeah, i counted). two rolls of TP hanging out on top of the dispenser, each with one square left on them. realizing i need to sterilize my hands from just walking into this mess, i discover no soap or paper towels (not very surprising). as well, hair clippings all over the sink, like the guys are trimming their moustaches on their break. un-freaking-believable. i am still haunted by this bathroom experience.  but car's running great!

Carolina's: An Ode to the Flour Tortilla:  I no longer live in AZ and miss fresh, amazing flour tortillas like craaaaazaaaay. I come here at least once (more if I can) whenever i visit.   Their flour tortillas are HUMONGOUS. Like, kind of out of control. The fold them over twice to get them in the plastic bag when you order a dozen. Here's a tip! Don't store them like that or they start to crack from being folded/unfolded over and over again when you want to take one out of the bag! And nobody likes a burrito warpper with structural flaws   They are so fresh and warm when you get them, the bag steams up with their goodness Another tip: rip a small hole for the trip home or else that steam makes them gummy and stick together - again endangering the structural integrity. Yet another tip: Don't throw them into a suitcase which shortly goes into an airplane's hold, or you'll arrive at your destination with frozen tortillas due to the moisture in the bag+high altitude cold air   Refried Beans: Carolina's Unsung Hero Seriously delicious. When you can order something as simple as a bean and cheese burrito and feel like it's the best meal you've ever had, you know you got something special.  Fair warning (and I'm sorry in advance veggies): both the tortillas and beans have lard in them.  If you're planning to eat in, be aware this is not really a restaurant. It's like a small tortilla factory/ordering counter that has some card tables and plastic chairs strewn about. I sort of took this for granted while talking Carolina's up to my (British) husband and mother in law. By the time we got there they must of thought I'd lost my mind. Then they took their first bite and never doubted me again :)

And I don't even like BBQ. Well, that's not totally true, every once in a blue moon a nice pulled pork sandwich sounds good. But I generally find it to be vinegary and sometimes sugary (which I can't fathom for the life of me) and sort of sour and just weird. Usually I only eat it when forced to: at a friend's for dinner or the co-workers want to go out for BBQ for lunch. The latter being the reason I ended up here recently. We had actually attempted to lunch at the nearby indoor go kart race track, which has a café, but they don't serve until 1p. So we hit up the cramped mini strip mall of some of the only food for miles in this business park area I refer to as the "no man's land" when it comes to food.  I eyed the pulled pork sandwich on the menu, but decided to be adventurous (a risk when you don't really like BBQ) and went for the beef brisket wrapped in a tortilla. I added cheddar cheese (I mean go heart attack or go home, right?) to the wrap and got a drink and a side of garlic mashed potatoes for about $7.  It was rather busy in the small place on a Friday, so we had to sit at the bar style seating which means you stare at a wall - at least make the view out the window, I say. It was awkward seating for our party of two, so don't stumble in with 4-5 co-workers on a Friday and expect to all sit together unless you're lucky and get a small booth.  About 3-5 minutes later they called our orders. Pretty quick for how busy they were, and totally fine if you're running in and taking it to go. And damnit if that tortilla wasn't flavorful and amazing, and the brisket inside?! Fantastic. I was really, really impressed. Oh, it was greasy as hell (it dripped out the bottom and all over my hands) but very good. And VERY rich. I liked it so much I went back about two weeks later to get the same, and this time gobbled it up fast and felt ill after. So if you don't have an iron stomach take your time on this one. The mashed potatoes were a good size and also very tastey. All in all, I was very impressed with this fast food spot. For the money I got measurably better food than I would have imagined. Plus quick and friendly service makes four stars. Done and done.

Wow. I love a well-done happy hour and this steak house has it (pun intended). I had never even heard of this restaurant before some co-workers invited me out for post-office drinks on Friday afternoon. Our office in the "no man's land" of 48th St./Washington area, where the only restaurant within a mile has saguaro wearing a pair of sunglasses on its sign. So imagine my surprise when we pulled up to this Durant's-style retro-classy steak house. First of all, the door's are copper, a fact I find amazing due to my new-found love of this material in Arizona. I can't help it, it just always looks perfect out here.  So we headed straight back to the bar area, through the dark wood with brass accents, dimly lit area of the restaurant. The bar is pretty big, several tables and seats along the bar itself - which is just incredible. A huge, ornate, wood carved saloon style behemoth (that puts Prescott Whiskey Row's The Palace to shame even!). In this magical place, Four Peaks 8th Street Ale was just $3. I will repeat that: Three Dollars. And they offered FREE happy hour snacks, and good ones at that. Sliders with condiments and chips and salsa.  Just. Wow. The atmosphere and history makes it a perfect spot for out of towners, the happy hour deals make it great for an everyday pit stop after a crap day at work.

this place is great, but i am partial to anywhere that offers outside dining possibilities. actually, it's only outside dining, picnic tables, to be exact.  the Farm is just that, with an attached lunch counter to get chicken salad sandwiches with pecans, both fresh from on site. Tons of tall, shady trees, picnic tables and wandering ducks and birds to delight the kiddies.

i'm starving, so i'm going to write a review for the place i'd like to go to lunch to today.  they have the most delicious bagel sandwiches anywhere! i think it has something to do with my new obsession with mustard - here you have three choices, which they apply liberally .  There never seems to be anyone in line (except in the morning hours) so i can order and sit down or be back at the office in no time. they have booths, tables and outside patio tables.   $7 for sandwich, chips and a drink, and it kicks subway or sub factory's ass.   damn i'm hungry.

yeah, this is the place where pseudo sushi afficienandos go to feel like their really exotic food experts. if it's got cream cheese in it, it ain't sushi, and this place has cc is just about every roll.  happy hour is LOUD in the bar. not fun loud, but "let's crank the bad early 90s alt rock and top 40 emo rock as loud as possible" seemingly as catch all for the only demographics who will like this place- early 20s and late 40s and 50s who want to seem like they still know how to get down with the younger generation.  because it's ahwatukee (a "sleepy bedroom" community that is pretty affluent all in all and likes to be reminded), the crowd can be obnoxious, even more than this bar already is.  again, i recommend it as a place to go and be rowdy, not to eat great sushi.

oh, i can easily drop $80 here after just looking around for 10 minutes. i don't know how it's possible since their clothes are relatively cheap, but still cute and don't fall apart after one time in the wash.

I love Thai Basil! I've only been to the one in Ahwatukee (they have one next to Tops Liquors in Tempe), and I think it's pretty darn good.  They have all the usual suspects like Pad Thai Noodles, and it's a great vegan option because of the choice of tofu (or chicken or beef) with almost any dish and the rice noodles.  it's pretty darn cheap, too. i got noodle dish big enough for two meals, and some of the best iced tea I've ever tasted (seriously, these Thai folk have a secret recipe and i want it!) for about $8. and, you can order the dish as hot as you want it. I'm a pretty big wuss with spicy and i got a "one" and it was nothing. i would say a "two" would be qualified as "mild."

i first started hitting up the Alley at age 15, when I was finally allowed to go to shows... ha, it was the height of ska (i mean the height of ska before it hit uber mainstream and 90210 rocked Reel Big Fish in their opening music montage), and came here alot that year.  it's definitely a rock n' roll bar, that does an amazing hip hop night. yeah, sounds all over the place, right? but this joint pulls it off. it's been a year since i came to Blunt Club, but it was hap-e-nin! it was so crowded and it was a cool crowd with a nice mix of styles and great music.  i came here recently for a friday night happy hour, and it was dark and empty, which was fine by me. it's basically made up of two big rooms, with a large stage looked on with six or eight large booths, LA club style. There are plenty of other tables, bar stools, too.   Ok, for such a rock n roll heavy decor i was MAJORLY disappointed in the juke box selection. it was one of those electronic ones, so i thought if they don't have what i want, i'll just download it...nope. either it was not capable, or i was not capable of figuring out how to do it. i wasn't drunk and i do it all the time at other bars, so i'm pretty sure it was the latter, not the former.   other than that, it was a nice break from the usual HH scene, we had cheap drinks (they have nice stuff on tap and cold microbrew bottles, sweet!) and cheap food. rock on... i mean, without the rockin' music part.  oh, and yeah, this is BARELY mesa... it's JUST over the 101, on the other side of south tempe, so i guess that counts, but not really.

i spent all of last summer in this bar. yeah, it's in mesa. yeah, you can...oops, could smoke there, which was my friends were in love with it.   it's small, a dive bar complete with white trash/cowboy patrons and bar flys and kick ass juke box. it has darts and pool tables and cheap drinks.   it's got a palo verde-esqu ambiance, but without the too-punk-rock-for-you attitude. it's a nice escape from the tempe scene to be honest, a local dive where no one cares about your tattoos, your drunken antics or that you're dancing to david bowie because, well, he's invited you to.  "Let's Dance!"  * editor's note When I say "no one cares about your tattoos," i don't mean in the sense that you won't get dirty looks for them or judged by them. i meant this isn't the kind of dive where a pin up girl or koi fish is a requisite for coolness. it's just an honest, mesa dive and you don't get shit for street cred so leave the 'tude at home. or go to Palo

Oh my god, I LOVE this store. I grew up in Mesa (yeah, yeah) and back when the only movie theater was the Poca Fiesta 5-plex (it's long gone now) on Southern and Alma School, my sister and I just about begged on our hands and knees to visit this store before or after seeing movies like back to the future and neverending story.  It's every little kids' dream - stuffed animals, low-brow humor cards and paraphernalia (you know, farting figurines), balloons, brightly colored EVERYTHING, sparkly EVERYTHING, confetti - just damn cool stuff.  It's pretty decently-sized and jam-packed on every surface with STUFF. Plus, around Halloween, they carry all the basics like makeup, costumes, masks, etc. Last year, a friend went in to peruse the makeup selection for her zombie prom look and the employee happened to be a special effects guru. He helped her pick out every supply, tool, base, glue and blood she needed and even gave her instructions on HOW to use it. He also made sure to help explain why some brands of glue or blood are better than others (don't you just hate it when your scab falls off your face on the way to the party? Or your fake eyelashes keep peeling away at the corners?) To cut my rambling short - her makeup and her roommate's makeup looked amazing (some secret tip she got involved bunched up tissue, don't ask me how it works but it does).  Not that you're ever in Mesa just hanging out, but even when it's not Halloween and you have some time to kill -especially if you have small children with you - you have to visit Bubbles of Joy at least once in your life.

this is a great monday  morning review. first, let me set the scene for you:  it's Sunday night. I've spent literally the entire day nursing a hangover wtih frozen pizza and S&C dvds. finally, around 8 p.m., after the sun goes down i take my dog for her evening stroll.  fresh out the shower, and because it's dark, i rock a ridiculous PJs outfit of super short, bright orange shorts and a tank top in crayola crayon red. i look like a damn popsicle or something.   ... anyway, i return to find that in my hang over cloud i've by habit flipped the bottom lock as i walked out. for the record, i have never, ever locked my self out, lost my keys and in my 10 years of driving locked keys in a car one time. eff. i reapeat, eff. no wallet, no cell phone, no keys (car keys to drive to a safe house) and no  makeup.... and with a dog. did i say EFF! ?  so, i bite the bullet and walk up to the ampm on kyrene and elliot, 65-pound pit in tow who happens to pretty much hate strange men, particularly when they're on bikes. you know the exact kind of people who frequent am pms on a sunday night.  without the aid of a cell phone contacts list i came to realize i know about three numbers by heart. and one of them is my BBF's parents' number from 12 years ago. long story short i get a phone book and call every locksmith with 24 hour service in the valley.  A Professional Locks was the ONLY one who wanted less than $80, and estimated he could be there in about 30 minutes instead of the requisite hour everyone else needed to rescue a frustrated girl and her dog ( est. was $55 - a steal really considering every other locksmith considered this a 24-hour emergency type service given the day/time)  so i walked back and sure enough, he was there in the alloted time and even though he couldn't pick the lock because the door knob was so old and jacked, causing him to take the knob off and rekey it, he didn't charge more. now that's service. in fact, dozer even lunged and jumped on him all snarling (she's not a biter, just an intimidater) he didn't even freak out or get pissed. now that's class.   yes, they are licensed and bonded, too. i don't know why his price was so much cheaper, but i am stoked. five stars!

Whoa, i don't know about best pizza in Valley, but pretty good.  stands for New York Pizza Department, and it's order in line, pay, find a seat and go back to the counter to pick up your order type place.  the y also had salads, and a small bar area. good price for what you get.

two words: "bonjour, y'all!"  that is what is printed on the sign as you walk into this place. for most of you, that is enough for you to understand how i feel about this place. if not, i will expand.  imagine the restaurants in disneyland - fake brick features, a silly, comptely out of place new orleans main street decor. do you recall the simpsons episode where moe tries to turn his sleazy bar into a family restaurant, and sells it by saying, "if you like a bunch of crazy crap on the walls, then come to Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag"?  ....that's the feeling i get here: 'if you put stereotypical new orleans items on the wall (mardi gras beads/french horn), they will come."  i guess i can't be that pissed about it, becuase come they do - this place was packed. i'm pretty sure i was still drunk from the night before, and i wasnt' about to let go of my glory - boo to no drink specials, and no drinks besides beer and mamosas - not even a bloody mary. having spent the last four hours of beer time doing shots of sun kist, i was not about to even look at orange juice. thankfully, our server suggested a Hibiscus - champagne and cranberry juice- score!  in fact, our awesome server was this outing's only saving grace. she had a terrific sense of humor. the monterrey omelette looked fantastic, and the person who ate said as much. i had a quiche (like i said, i was drunk still) the crust of which was extremely greasy. potatoes were ok, better than your average home fries.   mamosas cost $5.25, but come with the mini bottle of champagne comes with, and most breakfast entrees come with juice - so you really end up with two drinks - not bad.  but seriously, the atmosphere is horribly family oriented.

The first time I came here it was prime lunchtime on a weekend and it was crazy...the line was out the door.  Then I came at lunchtime during the week about a year later and it was dead. Anyway, I always hear people talking about it like it's the bee's knees, but I think it's just ok.  You order at the counter, pay at the counter and they bring it out to your table. Pretty fast about it, too, so it's do-able for a work lunch. they have a salad bar that may or not be included in every order... i couldn't tell. There are also outside tables.

I'm going to go ahead and give this little place five stars because although it may seem overpriced for an 'order at the counter' place, the food quality is just as good as what you'd get at regular restaurant, just faster.  also, they have an entire menu of gluten-free items, or you can even say I'd like the Chicken Salad Spring Wrap gluten-free, and they know what you're talki ng about. Plus they have wine, and probably beer. AND i like their pad thai noodles and i even like the way they prepare their tofu, as george orwell would say, "double plus good."

this is located in what used to be a pretty happening strip mall because there was one of the only movie theaters around there. then a new googaplex opened and the whole area kind of dwindled.  wings are good, i attest to that. but... random shooting where a person dies and four others have to go to the hospital? not really my idea of good time.

This is fun, Alaskan, wood-lodge style eatery located in the same complex as the Chandler Mall.  amazingly, for being so close to the mall, you get some pretty good seafood for a really good price.  they have a full bar, compete with HH specials, though i don't recall being very impressed with the choices.

pretty average mexican food, with a large cantina area atttached that becomes a club of sorts on the weekend.  to be honest, i've been here three times in as many years. with casa reynosa and rosita's so close, i tend to opt for them over this place.

the whole idea of applebee's really bothers me. chain restuarants that you can go to all over the country just seem weird. it seems so much more worth it to try something new and unique and risk it not being great than going somewhere that introduced that obnoxious song about   baby back ribs... oh wait, that was chiles. well, i feel the same way about that restaurant too.  the only times i came here were to do their happy hour, which is pretty good, if you can stand the atmosphere. the HH hours are pretty impressive; 3 to 7 and 10 to midnight every night of the week. other than that - gross, gross, gross

anyone who has lived in the East Valley for more than two years and says they've never eaten here on a after-bar food run is a mentiroso (liar).  open 24 hours, this is only good when your taste buds, along with your judgment, is compromised.  fast food, but no taco bell, this is more authentic. come 2:30 am on the weekends, and even weekdays, the drive thru line snakes around the building, and it's almost all drunk drivers. i don't know why the tempe PD doesn't just stake out the drive thru exit and pick off DUI offenders one by one. expect to see girls running behind bushes to pee and guys trying to start fights from windows, and consider it entertainment as you wait for your food (this can be a 20-30 minute expedition during peak hours). food is not bad, and relatively cheap. just try not to pass out in your car while waiting for it

let me just say that i generally despise the raping of the letter "x," especially to infer that something is "extreme!" BUT i started going here because it was a place to chill while my tires where getting fixed at the discount tire nearby and kind of fell in love with it. it's an old bank, and they've kept the huge safe, complete with door, in the building (i suupose it would have been more of a pain to try and get rid of it). anyway, now it's a mini library and reading/study room. they also serve bagels, sandwiches, smoothies, and varioius snacks.  they have a drive thru, which is also nice.

i went here one time, to buy a car battery. i have no idea how this came about or why this kid offered, but next thing i knew, the 20 year old employee was changing my car battery for me in their parking lot. good for him, customer service gets an A+  ...too bad he didn't really know what he was doing. about an hour and a half later i'm stranded outside this tiny battery store while the kid is filthy and sweating, trying to figure out why my car won't do anything despite a stellar hook up job. a few phone calls to his buddies, he realizes there's a kill switch for the car alarm that must be tripped post battery change.  so, another 20 minutes of the two of pushing the button, then turning the key. then key turn/button push combo. nope. ok, ok. you push and hold the button, then turn the key. got it! poor kid. probably thought he would help a damsel in distress (i wasn't really) and spent half his shift wondering "how the hell am i going to tell this girl i broke her car?"  alls well that ends well. five stars!

well, it doesn't seem very fun to review a grocery store, but this one is infamous. because of its proximity to ASU, it's often called the "hot chick" safeway - no joke.  it used to be open 24/7, but i think it now closes by 12 a.m. and there are always lots of co-eds, usually newbie college freshman shopping together (you can tell they're freshman because they haven't yet realized that shopping wtih roommates for food is a terrible idea). and i agree, they're all very cute in that typical "college" way.   and it's always refreshing to see kids dressed up to go out, just picking up a back up bottle of vodka for the after party on a monday or tuesday night. ha ha, in fact, last night while shopping for a Valentine's dinner meal, my boyfriend and I giggled at the frat boy who was inspecting cards while holding a handle of jim beam in one hand and a heart-shaped box of chocolates in the other... his girl is one lucky lady...  to get to the point, the co-ed factor and busyness of this place kept me away from it, choosing instead to shop at the next closest store, fry's on mill and southern. ok, let me tell you Fry's is a dump; it's dirty, dingy, it smells funny and their veggies are gnarly. hot chick safeway is clean, bright and they have super friendly staff, who are always willing to help you find something or tell you how to broil a steak cause it's raining out and you're screwed for your valentine's grilled steak dinner idea. it's a tad more expensive than Fry's but totally worth it, not for eye candy, (but that's great if you're a 19 to well, 70-year old guy) but for the better service and better facility, and they always have killer deals on things like frozen pizzas and snacks cause, well, what else do college kids eat?

It is really, really hard to top Erica O.'s spot-on review of D&E. A good friend dragged me here one night three years ago playin' it up over their cheap Red Stripes (her drink of choice) and well drinks (vodka being my drink of choice; though preferably not well).  Anyway, I meet her and her BF at the time here at 9 on a Sat night. Man, was this place sort of depressing. Not much was going on, and lots of TVs were on everywhere displaying some white trash recreation (nascar? Ufc? Monster trucks? Who knows).  She did have one thing right - it's cheap, and you get what you pay for. Typical bar food (cheese sticks, fries, wings, burgers) is sub-par - though we totally lucked out recently with a Rocky Point-style taco special that was actually really, really good. They should put THAT on the menu.    The average patron appears to be of the fake ID variety to the pushing 35 variety. And invariably sporting a TAP OUT or Ed Hardy shirt. Despite the dilapidated décor, smelly bathrooms and cheap booze, I can't call this place a dive bar - it's just too big and has too many TVs to qualify. Speaking of the bathroom, I once overheard a conversation between two girls, one of which wanted to call some guy or another to "hang out" with after they left, the other of which was slurredly talking her out of it, at one point reminding her that the last time they hung out, he choked her. Awesome.  But I keep coming back because I can ride my bike here (I just can't typically ride it home from here).

i'm not in love with this chain, and this location in particular is pretty bad. usually dried up or slightly brown lettuce, dirty floors, etc. when you go out specifially for fresh salads, it's just the last thing you want to be surrounded by, i guess. i lived in an apartment in the same complex as this one for a year and literally went there one time.

yes and yes. i went here recently with a girlfriend and her boyfriend for some Rock 'n Bowl action. i hadn't been to a bowling alley on the weekend for about...10 years? wow, have they stepped it up a notch. no longer is it black lights, disco lights and bad alt rock. now they have huge, drop down screens that play videos of top 40s while you bowl - and i dont know about you, but justin timberlake really helps me work on my 65 average.  tip: the bud light bottles that are shaped like bowling pins seem like a fun idea, but - guy or girl - it is totally inappropriate to drink out of a bottle shaped like that, and you will feel ridiculous trying to do so.

my roommate and i had no problems while we lived here (one year, in 04-05). it was a reasonably priced two bedroom, and the building we had was single level, on the end, so we had it pretty good. our one shared wall neighbor was a guy we saw maybe once each, but we often saw his grossly overweight cat (that had learned to open the front door by turning the knob, it was eff-in crazy) hanging out in the shared walkway.  but that's neither here nor there.... when it came to move out time, at the bad advice of my roommate, we simply dropped the keys in the box and didn't do a walk through. i didn't know any better, having never in an apt like that before. next thing i know, they send us a bill for $1400! we were charged exorbantly for everything from dusty fan blades (charged $10 each blade) to a dirty mirror (that cost us for some reason like $20).  they tried to charge us for replacing all the carpet, but didn't subtract the prorated amount of one year's worth of wear (which you're required to do). anyway, we tried to compromise - we had cleaned but there were stains on carpet - and asked to see receipts/estimates on the number they were throwing at us. we were told again and again by the office girl a manager would call us back, and we never heard anythig until we got a collections notice!  we tried everything from contacting the corporate office to hiring a lawyer, but ultimately we settled with collections for about half (once split between the two of us wasn't so bad) so we could gurantee it would not effect our credit. i could not believe how unprofessional they were there! be warned.

there are some bars/restaurants in tempe, and, i suppose phoenix as well, that just smell funky. Long Wong's was like that, for example. it's just an "old building" smell mixed with leaky pipes, i'm not really sure.   this place has that smell. for some places, that smell is acceptable and sometimes even a welcome reminder of the many, many good times you've had there. this place's smell is not friendly reminder of anything.  maybe i came on a bad night - it was sunday and it is summer after all - but this place was pretty dismal. but, i give them stars for serving food past 10, when everywhere else in universe was closing at 9 or 10 (the Ho Ho, across the street and my first choice, had a weird private party going on, which is how we got stuck with the new yorker).  they have a full menu and they serve til 2 a.m., which is a nice last ditch, back pocket choice. but i warn you if you're not drunk, which we weren't- it's not very good. the mozerella sticks came out warm on the outside, cold in the middle (when we very nicely told the server this he looked at us like we were lying, and if we weren't pulling his leg, seemed confused as to what he was supposed to do about it), and the sliders were the driest meat and oldest buns ever. my vodka cranberry came out in a large drinking glass that was ALL cran (that's my pet peeve, it's like "i have to drink all this juice/cola/clb soda just to get my barely shot of boooze? lame"). on my second drink order, i asked for a smaller glass, and explained i just wanted less cran in the drink, not a weaker drink. the glass that came out was comical -basically a large shot glass for say, washing apple shots, etc. - and still way, way too red, even for that tiny glass. i began to suspect  i was on a hidden televvision program of some sort, but just dropped it, because by then i had already stomached what i could of our greasy meal and given up on getting anything wortwhile out of this place.  unless you're a die hard fan that can't get your small town home team game any other way, i wouldn't bother.

I'm not usually one to pay double to have my oil done in fifteen minutes, but a couple times, like before a road trip i would have no choice.  one time everything was just fine, everyone was pleasant. but i hate the nonsense of them pulling you out to your car, lifting your hood and giving the rehearsed, ten times a day spiel about needing a new air filter, windshield wipers, windshield fluid..blah blah blah. one time in the spiel i totally thought the guy said that my "cabin pressure" was off. when i interrupted to ask "did you just say cabin pressure?" he was so taken off guard that i was listening to everyone word, he didn't know what to say. anyway, not a fan of this location

If i could give this place a gazillion stars i would... the service is spotty, and the decor is nothing special, but my god the food is to die for if you like authentic, bad for you Mexican food. the family that owns this place is from Globe, and i hear that city is known for some damn good mexi food (other than that it's pretty much a dump).  when i walk in this joint, it smells like my grandmother's kitchen, and that makes my mouth start watering on the spot. the refried beans are unbelievable and the tortillas are huge, with the brown spots on them that let you know their homemade in house. (p.s., if you don't know, Mexican food is supposed to be made with lard, so if you're vegan, be wary of this spot, because this is def a lard-use mexi joint)  i keep it simple with a red tamale and a bean and cheese burrito. the price is on par with a place like Macayo's. $8 for the plates that would have say, two tacos and beans and rice. and single items range from $3.99 and up. be warned, the first bowl of chips is free, "thereafter you pay." i know that's lame, but what can you do? they have the food equivalent of crack and they know it. i seriously love this joint!

I rarely went there unless I needed something specific for my dog, like a leash or collar. For food, I just go to Tempe Feed and Tack (se their review).  Anyway, I'm reviewing this place anyway, because they are phasing out all the general pet stuff to focus stricyly on reptiles and fish. I think that's cool, and frown on "pet" stores that have dogs and cats that cost $300 and are inbred anyway. this way, if you're in to turtles, lizards or snakes, you have a place to ask weird questions about your pet. or if you're thinking about getting a turtle, you can find out which one would be right for you.   when i did go there for help with a specialized leash (a halty leader) the girl at the counter was super helpful, and knew the pros and cons of every brand, and even sent me to another store to get one she thought was better.

hee hee. this place happens to be right next door to Palo Verde, and was the closes liquor store to me for two years.  Sam is a pretty fun guy, and i'm pretty sure he only understood about half of what me and my drunken roommates were asking for when we'd inevitably make the trek up there for more booze.  they have a small selection of just about everything you would want, about as much as a circle K, and about five shelves of red wine. i think he's open til about midnight or one on the weekends.

It's nary Halloween time, and that means shopping for fake blood, wigs, decorations, costumes and costume accoutrements (pirate swords, bullet wounds, sunglasses, stage glue, fake teeth...)  Every year since I found out about this little costume/party store I've hit it up no less than 3 times - usually more - between early September and up to Halloween day. It's got just about everything you would need from a party store like the standard balloons for a birthday, novelty tiaras that say "Mother-To-Be", themed plates, and my favorite stuff like several kinds of fake blood and amputated hands, scars and scabs... They have rent-able costumes of better quality, and the standard cheap ones that come in a bag and fit like a burlap sack.  If you think you need a wig for your costume - THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO. Why? Because they about 50, and YOU CAN TRY THEM ON before you buy. They have sample ones out on mannequin heads to see what you like, then you buy the not-messed-with one in a bag - awesome.  It's pretty small, and nothing compared to those Spirit warehouse-size stores that pop up every year. BUT I keep coming because they've never let me down and aren't nearly as crowded as Spirit gets mid-October.  So, if you find yourself in need of a pimp hat this Halloween (I hope you're more inspire and creative than that) or party supplies off-season, I highly recommend this place!

i would say this is a dive bar. but it's kind of big for a dive... and it's got a pretty big patio, which doesn't really seem to be a "dive" thing. but you can bet on horses and dogs and that's pretty dive-esque.  a big, four-sided bar right in the middle and shuffle board (any bar with shuffle board pretty much kicks ass) and a skill crane game. they do free texas hold 'em every weekend, and all the participants are friendly and it's a good time.  they serve food, the wings are kind of awesome, but i'm not a wing connoissuer by any means. a great, cheap little bar to escape to when the usual scene gets old, i affectionately refer to it as the "Ho-Ho."

this place is dark, dingy and def a dive. uninspired, "hey, that beer sign is glued to the wall UPSIDE DOWN! this place sure is wacky!" and the bathrooms are gnarly. the staff two out of the three times I've been was college age and none to worried about pleasing their customers. the HH is pretty good, and it's a pitchers and wings type of place. the apps are HUGE! we ordered the half size nacho plate and it came out on a pizza pan! the only reason we go there is if we want to eat and drink cheap late at night (i think they serve til 1) and because they have trivia you can play on the big screens from remotes at your table. other than that, don't bother.

i fell out of the TOL routine for some time, but i'm back and really liking it.  about six pool tables, and they hold a few tournaments, so you end up with a lot of serious pool players throughout the week, along wtih hipster, tattoo types.  the bartenders are sweet as can be, and poor a nice, strong drink for cheap beyong belief.  jukebox is one of those electronic, download database ones, and so there is some good stuff on there, or you can get it if it's not.  thursday nights here are pretty good, weekend nights can be hit or miss. lots of big booths and few bar tables, and long bar that runs the length of the joint. hidden in a strip mall, don't be discouraged by the boring outside, it's pretty fun inside if you're a local

Oh, the good times that used to abound here! this used to be a great spot to see some Tempe locals that wanted to slum it from Casey's or just wanted cheap, strong drinks and some good tunes on the jukebox.  at it's height of trendiness, you could barely move or order a drink at 1 a.m. on the weekend, but it's popularity has waned severely in the past two years. it's a great escape from the college scene, with a couple of pool tables and PBR in a can is the drink of choice type of atmosphere.  i miss when it was fun to go here, not cool. p.s. it's also the type of bar that opens at 6 a.m., so if you're still awake and partying, hitup this joint.

The first time I heard about MFC was when I was invited into a book club by a bunch of women at my new job about a year and a half ago. That about sums it up - women love this place, and go there to drink wine and be silly and talk about books from oprah's book club.  I get it - there's a pianist, and fresh cut flowers and "florist" and "café" are right in the name. it's got "silly wine women" painted all over it. When my friend picked this spot as the place for our regular hh get-together for some late 20's 9-5ers it made sense. I went to the web site to check on pricing. I was annoyed to see salads for $15, sandwiches for not much less. No happy hour specials? Now I'm downright pissed. Then I went to check out some reviews and was surprised that so many yelpers had given it poor reviews for service and food quality. How do they justify the prices? And what's this about _microwaving_ the food?!  But, my friend had been looking forward to trying MFC, so I zipped my lip and showed up. I like the space - the long, floor-to-ceiling storefront style windows let light stream in and the décor is simple and airy. I was the first to arrive and told the host who was at the front (I guessed a manager as he had an air of importance and hurriedness about him and wore a different colored shirt than the rest of the staff) there would be five of us. His response: "ooooooooooo-kaaaay." Nice attitude. Then, "Do you not have a reservation?" um, for five people at 5 o'clock? No, of course not. It was not busy at all, but he made a big show of wandering around the restaurant, finger to mouth and looking perplexed about my request.  Finally I offered to sit at the bar until the rest arrived and continued to go "WTF?" when discovering there wasn't a glass under $12 or a bottle under $50. Again, how is this justified?  When two other girls arrived about 10 min later, I flagged him down and said "we're ready for a table," and he again seemed noticeably annoyed (so much so that the other girls commented on it). I had envisioned MFC was hh hot spot, especially on a Friday, and kept waiting for it to fill up, but it never did and I still don't understand the issue.  OK- one good, important point to note, our actual server was awesome. She was friendly, helpful and attentive. Gave informed suggestions/opinions when asked, etc. Then I found out that bottles were half off: ok, that's a little better. (Then one of the girls mentioned that bottles are half off all day, every day... Then why not put that price on the menu? To uphold some image of pretention? I don't get it and I'm back to annoyed).  We got the Willow bread basket to share. The herbed butter overpowered the taste of the fresh breads and I had maybe half a piece (I'm a bread addict and surprised I didn't devour all of it - just wasn't that good. The best one was the cranberry). I ordered the "nachos" app for $8 and it was ok (one-inch bread slices smothered in jalapeño-cheese with avocado and salsa on the side). One girl got a wrap and loved it. Another got lobster bisque and said it was just ok. After everyone was done and had formed their own opinions on their meals, I shared my findings on no stove/microwave situation. They were all pretty shocked, especially in light of the prices.  I was disappointed that the live music I had heard so much about didn't start up until 7, right when we were getting ready to leave. I really don't think any of us had an experience that would draw us back.  (sorry this is so long. i try to edit myself, i really do)

I grew up going to this museum, and the expansion is killer. Part underground, four-levels, an expanded fashion gallery and finally a gallery just for photography!   it's beautiful and it feels nice to be in there...before you realize it, you've been wandering around for three hours.   do not miss the suspended charred wood installation piece on the third level of the expansion, it is really cool. i heard some snot-nosed kid who's parents weren't parenting ran through the suspended pieces, tangling them up and now it has a velvet rope around it...too bad.  *** update i just went there to see the Rembrandt exhibit and indeed, there is a rope around the piece - boo. i also wanted to be sure to note  the installation piece that is a DO NOT MISS- It's in the northwest corner of the third level. an entire room made to be near pitch-black, with every wall (including floor and ceilings) mirrored but with a brown tint- so you can see a faint outline of yourself... but you are not the star of the show. suspended from the ceiling are dozens of strings with tiny LED lights all the way down that slowly fade in and out as all blue, then all green and then all red and then a rainbow. with all the mirrors and the sound-proof room, the ultimate effect is that you literally feel like you are floating in space -- it was unlike anything i had ever felt before and it literally took my breath away. --side note-- before i left i couldn't resist and came back to the room for another experience, except this time i thought i knew what it was all about and just rushed in without taking my time to get my bearings and get oriented. i nearly had a panic attack after running into a wall. a totally different experience than the first, which further raises my respect for this piece

It was everything i dreamed it would be: greasy, fatty, salty, sweet, syrupy, buttery - delicious.   It's worth the hype.   I ate it all and regret nothing.  Well done, Lolo's.

I realize that going to a cool-baby dive bar when you're not a weekend regular can be, well, not very fun. I've taken countless friends to Time Out and Palo and Yucca and they all hate it the first time, and I'm sure think "what's the big deal about this dump?"  But Bikini was just downright boring when a friend and I arrived there around 8:30p on a Friday night. The two bartenders were the most un-friendly gals of all time. One younger (maybe early 30s?) and one older (weathered mid-50s, gruff and had def seen some shit in her time) couldn't be bothered with just about anything. As I sat there, I wondered, "am I having a bad time cause I'm not a regular?" and decided that no, my fave dives certainly have friendly bartenders at least... and certainly have music!  When we inquired about the lack of any music, we were answered with a grunt and a nod at the (broken) jukebox behind us. We responded that we had noticed the jukebox .... And got back an empty stare.  Ok fine, what's on the tv. The Barret Jackson auto auction? Boring! We asked if we could get a switch to the Suns game. The two leaned in and whispered before responding that "that's what the rest of the bar wants to watch." We look around, not a person in the place was watching it. So my friend polls the bar "do you care if we change it to the suns game!?" no one objected and the bartenders were annoyed but began the process of tracking down the remote and figuring out how to change the channel. Nice try.  Finally around 9:30 things picked up, a DJ started and the bar began filling with the crowd I expected; young (really young!) hipsters - more specifically those who were coming from Trunk Space next door. Apparently there was a show going on but no booze there, so they trickled in and out between sets. The DJ was pretty good, I have to admit. The drinks were cheap ($4 for a well mixed drink) and there were about 8 beers on tap, including imports. and i will give a shout out to mini pitchers, they make me happy and make me feel 22 again.  I don't know, maybe I'm too old to bother "breaking in" another dive. Maybe I'm too old for sassy bartenders in dumpy spaces. But I found this particular classic to be just a little overrated.

the only thing i can review is the bean and cheese burrito, because that's all i get and it's all i ever need.  their refried beans are the creamiest, most savory in all of phoenix (i would except for casa reynoso, except this is owned by the same family!).  i can't even find words for much i enjoy their perfect tortillas. but i can say that i can gobble a burrito up in about 45 seconds, and i am the world's slowest eater.   true story.

i have only one thing to say:  it is unforgivable that i am a native and had never been to chez nous - that's how impressed i was all around by this dark, Al Green-playing bar.   i hereby self-revoke my right to high five other phx natives when we encounter each other in our travels.

$1.75 margaritas, all day, every day.     What else is there to say?     OK, I have a few more things to say. I started coming here about a year and a half ago because it's a hop, skip and jump from my office and was the go-to Mexi restaurant for special lunches and happy hours.  For its decent food and SUPER-fast and friendly service, you can't beat it. It will satisfy that Mexican food craving but 'tis true it is nothing to write home about. (I imagine if I were from the East Coast or like Idaho or something, I really would write my friends and family regularly to brag about the amazing Mexican food in AZ, just sayin'.)  Cases in point of "super-fast-and-friendly-service": 1)Came here for drinks and apps with a friend and were about to settle our tab and head out the door anyway when our server kindly asked if we would mind moving tables to accommodate a large party - and we would be given margaritas on the house for the "trouble." 2) Myself and two other friends dropped in for a quick bite and were brought chips and salsa before even ordering - I love that - and our margarita orders were taken immediately and were out within the minute. When our food orders were placed, the plates were out within three minutes - I'm not kidding! And our waters and margaritas were never below the one-third line before being asked if we'd like more. Also, the server gave not one, but TWO freebies: shots of sweet red liquid he simply called "Mexican Kool-Aid" (he even smiled when I hissed "I think we're being roofied, go with it!") and rice pudding. He apparently thought we might like it, and I sure did.  Anywho, it's consistently fast and friendly and pretty cheap too. Throw in those cheap drinks and what's not to love about that?

This is sprawling, brand new  "campus" located right in downtown mesa. performing arts stages, galleries, classes, restaurants...this city-run campus is a really, really nice venue to do anything. my architect friend said the campus was a little...over the top... there are lot of things going on, and it is a little overwhelming. but not a disjointing experience. every month they do their Sound in the Ground events, which are aimed at younger, hipper crowds. they feature music that relates to the new, featured exhibit. for example, February's theme was Salsa to coincide with an exhibition of La Loteria (which was AMAZING), and they had latin/retro/surfer rock band perform, and margaritas on special at their cash bar. the hold the events in this beautiful below ground courtyard with plenty of tables and chairs, or you can sit right on the graduated concrete step in front of the travertine  flowing waterwall. you really have to see it to appreciate it. be sure to check out Sound in the Ground before it gets to hot to hang out and listen to music outside!

this isn't going to be a very accurate review, you see, because once i drunkenly stepped out into the sun from FOE (see review: fraternal order of eagles) and made our way to meet our LR pub crawl group halfway between stop 27 and 28, we were a liiiittle. wasted. but i'll do my best.  i have driven past the giant, yellow, Groggy's sign (complete with drunken frog) on Apache probably a million times, but never once went in. well, we did this time, and the poor bartender held up like a champ, so that's an automatic two stars. i think on a normal day this place sees no more than five customers at a time. and here, about 40 people show up demanding beer! and food! now! we've got a schedule to keep!  for a divesque place with no customers, they had a super cute, college-aged, normal looking bartender. another star for you, groggy's!  the actual bar area is kind of small, i would call this place more of a pool hall, cause that's what took up most of this cavernous place. mini pitchers, regular pitchers and are those 32 oz. mugs of beer!? well, there s another star for you.  heading to the bathroom and there are two toilets in the ladies room ... but only one stall. you heard me. you walk in, and there's a just a toilet hanging out there in the open, next to an actual stall with a door. huh. report from the BF entailed saloon doors for the one men's stall. (you know how short saloon doors are, right? and by nature, they do not lock...) again, huh. but i won't knock a star for either because it's so random it's pretty great.  so, on a completely seemingly baseless scale, four stars for groggy's!!    wait, did i add that up right?

it's been years since i went, but it was really, really cool. the setting is exactly what you'd expect from an authentic German rest., it was dark with lots of wood, very old world style. this was the first place i tried frog legs (isn't that a French thing?) but they have tons of great food.

this cute little pizza, salad and pasta place in east chandler is great. my mom can't eat food with gluten, which pretty much rules out anything with bread. this place is the only restaurant i know of that specializes in gluten-free pizza.   pretty genius as actually quite a few people are allergic to gluten and now they have a restaurant to go to! they have regular crust too, as well as gluten free beer and gluten free brownies. if you know someone who can't eat gluten products get them a gift cert to this place or pick them up a Brownie, they will love it!

this is the best little pizza joint in tempe. located right on mill ave., it is now open LATE. they used to close down pretty early, like 10 or 11, even on weekends. so when the BF and i saw the line snkaing out of it while walking to the car from rula bula after last call, we were STOKED! it took like 20 minutes, but it was worth every second. the pizza hails from Boston, and is thin and crispy - i'm partial to the feta/tomato. a few tables and counter space, a few more tables on the small patio. you order at the counter, pay at the counter and find your own seat. nothing fancy, jsut tasty Slices.

this bar is nice and laid back, with thrift store decor and spacious patio and inside area. the bar staff is super cool and sans attitude at this scottsdale late night eating staple. i think they were voted "cutest, girl next door waitresses" in the Tribune's Get Out last year. drinks are reasonable, and they are open late, as in 4 a.m. i think, serving food the whole time. pretty sweet. they do a lot of drink specials, too.

I didn't stay here, but came for a sunday brunch with a friend's family whom were celebrating a couple birthdays in october.  the spread was as impressive as you would imagine from a resort of this caliber. one entire room (where you wait to be seated) was just for creme brulee, chocolates, cakes, etc.  i have to say ambiance-wise, this place is absolutely gorgeous, but not my style. if your mom or grandma wants to do an uber fancy brunch or tea time (yes, they do a tea and scones deal) then this is your place. if you want a more post modern renovated hotel with tons of character, head for the valley ho or clarendon.  back to the brunch. we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table even though we had a reservation, but there was big tray of mimosas set on the desk where they take your name. nice that you didn't have to wait for someone to come around with a fresh glass or wait for a refill, but i swear the host was giving me the stank eye for downing three in 15 minutes. ah well, just getting my money's worth.  the dining room is huge with horseshoe booths, tables and a piano player who did a stand up job (i;m not even mad that he doesn't take requests to play journey). the first room was all seafood....my plate was stacked high before i even made it to the salad table, the meat room or the fresh omelette or pancakes table. it was all delicious, i was smart to pace myself to be able to try everything. the clientele was as i mentioned above, but the buffet staff gets double points for making sincere, appreciative comments on our tables' tattoos (not a hint of creepy guy or 'i'm just repeating what i hear them say on Inked," nice work).  you could sit outside on the patio where there was a huge lawn for playing croquet (did you have brain tumor for breakfast?). it was really a delicious brunch, but if i'm spending that much money again i'm opting for a place that i feel more comfortable.

I was actually at the Baby Gap next door... and I was really, really impressed.  First, I don't the first thing about shopping for an infant or newborn, i don't like being in children's stores and i don't really want to spend money on children. but, as it happens, i must attend a baby shower.  it hit me first while at Target when i walked past all those tiny little easter dresses and gloves. so wandered through the racks and picked up a pink something or other and thought 'this'll do' before realizing it's way too big for a newborn. i tried to make heads or tails of their size system to no avail and left convinced i should never, ever have a child. then i walked by Baby Gap, and walked IN to Baby gap for the first time ever. first off, their stuff is way cuter than target (and thankfully none of their onsies said crap like "boyfriend stealer" or "heartbreaker" - ok, that is just inappropriate) and, like Gap, when that stuff goes on sale, it really goes on sale.  i picked up three onsies that feel nice and soft and features age-appropriate images of flowers, ducks and bunnies. $15, done and done and over in less than 10 minutes - yes! plus, they gave me very nice gift box and ribbon. double plus good, i'm a fan.

how could i have not yet reviewed the TT?  This was the first official AZ bar I went to (legally as a 21 year old, that is to say).  It was december, so they had the fire oven going, the window open, and they were playing punk rock on the juke box and skate videos on the television.. i was pretty much in love.  this place is tiny! about five booths big enough for four, a two-sided bar with another...15 seats... and small room with a pool table squeezed in. i haven't been in awhile - i fell out of a lot of phx tiny spots cause they just get too smoky - but it would get hopping every friday and saturday night - like you're rubbing shoulders it's so crammed.  they also have darts, and i kind of think it's real darts, not the silly plastic ones.

To be honest, I only ever head to this museum for their SMoCA Nights, which are pretty cool if you haven't checked it out.   if you go, break out your hipster gear or be prepared for some tight pants and too-pretty hair. but it's a cool way for local fashion designers, bands and street artists to get some exposure with a crowd that will enjoy their style -  it can be a lot of the same faces and artists, though...i feel like once i went to one, i couldn't expect anything different the next time or the time after that.  but! it's a cool way to see the newest exhibits. which are are really innovative. i.e., an entire architecture firm (Eddie Jones) operating out one of the galleries for several weeks - they literally moved the entire office into the museum- and the Celebrity exhibit is really unique, i can't wait to see that.

Wow ... just, wow! I couldn't have been happier with my experience at Persian Room. The service, the food, the wine selection, the ambiance, everything was pretty much perfect.  And it's a good thing too, because my first visit was to take my mom out for her birthday. She loves Middle Eastern food and is gluten intolerant, so the meat and/or veggie kabobs and rice-focused menu was perfect for her (and my vegetarian sister who was also with us). It is really hard to find a restaurant that appeals to people with varying dietary needs/choices and this one suited us perfectly.  I had first heard about the restaurant when it was briefly profiled on PBS. The food sounded fantastic and the space looked gorgeous! More on the traditional-fancy side, it offers a grand staircase in the middle of the room that goes up to the bar area. The first floor has a few booths and several tables (which were almost all taken at 6p on a Sunday, with large families and older couples).   Our stellar service started when we were asked if we wanted a table or a booth. So simple, but a great gesture to ensure your clients are most comfortable. Our server was excellent about offering suggestions and explaining items when I told her I was pretty unfamiliar with the food on their menu. She offered the info that their (enormous) entrees are very flexible - if one comes with two chicken kabobs, you can ask for one chicken and one koobideh, and you can halve your side of rice (it's huge) and fill that in with a Greek salad. Fantastic, though it meant we took another 10 minutes putting together our order.   I ended up with the koobideh kabob (ground beef mixed with garlic and onion and spices) and the polo rice, it was great. Mom got the filet kabob (replacing 1 of the 2 with a chicken kabob) and traded out the regular basmati rice with a specialty rice that included raisins and dates. Sister went veggie kabob and a side of the same specialty rice. None of us had a single complaint. Pita bread was fresh and delicious, cucumber/yogurt dip was tart and refreshing.  We had given our mom her bday card at the table, and when the server came by to clear our plates, she asked if it was a bday celebration and offered their Persian ice cream (vanilla ice cream with rose water, pistachios and honey). Seriously, was she great or what? We said of course and baklava for sister and I to share also. The ice cream came out with a candle and syrup "Happy Birthday" and our baklava came out sliced in half for us. I know, it's small stuff but it all added up and just impressed us again and again. (You better try that Persian ice cream if you go, it is incredible).  One last awesome move on the server's part - when she saw us dividing up the leftover pita in out to-go boxes, she offered more of their "good bread" (that they don't start serving until later in the evening) that was fresh out of the oven. She brought us out a stack of it wrapped and ready to go.  I repeat: Wow.  p.s. I have to admit I immediately get on the offense when I go to a restaurant that doesn't have an entrée below $13 on the menu. I get very "who do they think they are?" Then I'm like a hawk for all they ways they fall short of their price-prohibitive ways. And this place blew me away, worth every penny by way of portion sizes, service, quality and atmosphere.  To give you an idea (I always like knowing costs of stuff before I commit - champagne taste, champagne of beers budget, you see), we ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer dip, a small Greek salad, three entrees and one dessert, and the total was just over $100.  p.p.s. I don't call myself Lauren "Longest Reviews Ever" V. for nuthin'

this is a great little bar hidden in a funny little strip mall- there used to be, or still might be a goofy hip hop dance club nearby, which is great for laughs as you're coming or going. tons of beers on tap and even more in a convenience store like, in-wall refrigerated area across from the bar. pick out one and ring it up and put in a glass, or pick a beer on tap. lots of space to spread out and eat, watch a game or play cards. big plus, this place has a bunch of board games to bust out while you enjoy your brew.   ***Update: i feel obligated to note that this place is LOUD. i just went this weekend to meet up with some friends, and it was not just busy loud, but kinda hurts my eardrums the way the accoustics work in here loud. oh, and Club Rain (the goofy hip hop club) is still there, but i saw no one coming or going, so perhaps it got raided.

a very dear friend of mine worked here for ...almost a year? i used to adore this bar and come 2-3 times a week - 50 cent PBR monday was very popular for some time.   i have to say i have not been back since my lady friend stopped bartending there. then i heard about the Sat night thing and was intrigued, but then ultimately turned off. i thought it might be like how Hot Pink used to be, but maybe i''m just too old for that to sound fun anymore or something.  this review may not be too helpful since i haven't been in over a year, but it's a huge space with a more rockabilly/gearhead/old school punk crowd (during the week that is). fantastic juke box, cheap drinks, heavy pours.  it's totally missable, but look for the convenient store. even if there's a spot in the parking lot, i wouldn't do it - you end up having to BACK OUT onto scottsdale road, and after a few drinks, and it being scottsdale road at 1 or 2 a.m. it's a terrible idea. just go to the next residentail street, turn right and park in the neighborhood. i've never had a problem doing that. don't park in the convenient store parking lot though, he will tow you.  two...and a half stars

A true Phoenix-area gem - I can't believe I never reviewed it. As everyone already noted the docents are incredibly knowledgable and engaging. The anecdotes and stories are interesting and not too tourist-geared.  You'll learn a lot about FLW and not just about his architecture but his many inventions as well - including bi-fold doors (wha??) and in floor lighting used by movie theatres. I took my husband who knew nothing of the man, and he left in awe of the building and the architect.  It is completely guided but there is the ability to roam the grounds and outdoor area a bit and yes - take all the photos you want, for most of the tour it's fine.  If it's summer time consider the night tour.

this another place that i would give no stars to if possible.  it's been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember, which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases, and even more impressive because i don't know a single person who goes there.  i went in there one time, for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars I've ever seen. for some reason, it's right by the door. instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables.  after seeing that first off, i wouldn't dream of ordering food here. the place is also dark and dirty and there's never anyone inside of it.  seriously, I'm really curious how this place survives. awesome little neighborhood wing and live music joints like long Wong's get torn down for high rise condos, yet gross, ghost town ruby Tuesdays hangs on the corner of main and main of Tempe. what is wrong with the world?

I love Four Peaks as a restaurant, but not as a drinking destination. I'm not sure why - the beers are great, i've sworn off the Kiltlifter but really enjoy the 8th St Ale and an occasional Peach. I think it just seems sooo laid back that i get sleepy after all the heavy food and beer. most of the seating is outside, although they've opened a big area by the casks. this is basically a huge, brink warehouse, and it's not air condidtioned, even in the summer. it's more like a swamp cooler feel and lots and lots of fans, so be wary of a summer venture- it may feel a little stick y and uncomfortable in there. there's tons of tvs, though the mentality and atmosphere is far from a sports bar. there is also a pool table or two. i highly recommend this place for brunch on sundays... they have their special mamosas (peach beer and champagne) and an awesome breakfast menu. it's hidden back from the main street and in the neighborhood, which i really like.

Still loving this place, nothing's changed there. I've become obsessed with their Hefewiezen, especially in the hot summer months. And still haven't touched a Kiltlifter in several years. And their menu has become one of my favorite bar menus in the entire Valley. Always delicious, quality eats that satisfy any hungry beer drinker. In fact, I love their Hefewiezen and Carne Asada so much, that I served it at my wedding. Think I'm kidding? I am not. Well, actually, I couldn't get their Hefewiezen because they don't do small kegs, only college frat party size kegs and that would have been far too much beer. But we sure did serve that Carne Asada (they forgot the tortillas, dammit). and the guests raved about it all night. Nice work, Four Peaks!

i wouldn't normally give an uninspired chain restaurant a Five Star rating, but i just love their brunch specials and big patio.  one of my favorite weekend ventures is getting friends and cruisers together to pedal to a local patio for some eats and drinks when the weather's nice, and this place is perfect for that.  it's tempe, so there's plenty of places to lock your bike within viewing distance from the joint's huge patio. it's right off mill, so there's plenty of people watching, and it seems like every other weekend there's a festival of some sort, too.  the brunch is sundays from 11 to 2, and breakfast options are as basic as eggs benedict (pretty good) to breakfast enchiladas (also spectacular). you also get muffins or cornbread to snack on that are excellent.  the best part is the drink specials, $3 mamosas and $3 bloody marys buffet. yeah, that's right, a buffet just for your perfect, do-it-yourself bloody mary. they have three or four mixes to choose from, like straight up tomato juice to their special spicy jalepeno blend. then you can add as much ice, veggies and fun stuff as you want. they have several different kinds of olives and why not throw in a beef jerky stick to stir it up? did i mention that for $3 you have your choice of top shelf vodka? i know, this is too good to be true, but it is. they have kettle one, skyy, absolut, you want it, they got it.  you're starting to understand why i would rather bike than drive up there, i hope. anyway, the crowd is so-so, but with a big group of friends, some sunshine and bicycles, it's pretty fantastic way to end a weekend.

this place is more of a marketing ploy than a sandwich shop. i know, i know, i must work for the man or be a hater, but that's not it. even back when i did fully and actively support their mantra, i thought the food was way too expensive for what it is and none too great.  yay! local independent eateries, boo going there just becuase, "dude, the sandwiches are like, totally, named after my favorite strain, man."

bagels are one of my top breakfast meals and this place has the yummiest bagels i've ever tasted.  i'm a stickler (p.s. why do i feel like a fifth grade teacher whenever i use the word "stickler"?) for good bread, and i hate bagels that taste like bland, toasted white bread (l;ike the kind you get at safeway).  these bagels are hard to describe - buttery? rich, tasty... a good consistency and texture, pretty much perfect. the cream cheese is pretty good, too - heavier than the "whipped" variety you would get at like Einstein's. and all the standard flavors of both bagel and cheese. the bagel sandwiches are fresh and good, and they have salads, too.  can get busy during the semester in the morning, but not ever absurdly long wait. i think ithey have free wi fi, too.

after Nita's bowed out, marquee stepped in to take most medium-sized shows, and i have to say as much as i loved nita's i like the marquee.  formerly the grand river opry (or something), they tore out the seats, so it's one huge, open floor right up to the stage. the floor slants movie theater style, so you get a good view, even if you're short and are too grossed out by the thought of being mashed between a couple of sweaty kids to go near the front. one big bar in the lobby area, and if the show's big enough, a couple of bar carts in the outside area, a bar right next to the stage, and even a beer tub or two if it's a REALLY crowded show. yes, parking is a bitch. DO NOT think you're the first person who has thought of parking in the nearby private lots or in the apartment complex down the way - you're not, and you will either be towed, ticketed or broken into, or all of the above. parking is only $5 (could be worse), and you can get close if you go early enough. if not, you will have to park across the bridge, so keep that in mind if it's hot, you're wearing heels, etc.   your best bet is to have a friend (or your mom - just because i'm 26 doesn't mean mom can't take me to shows, ha ha) drop you off. yes, you will be searched - bag and shoes.  pretty much any band you'll actually want to see will come here, so don't do anything stupid like sass the security, the bartenders or get in a fight, cause you will get 86-ed. but, that's just lame behavior anyway.

I've been going to this place for about six years, and to start off i have two theories on this place that I've heard repeated by more than a few people over the years.  1. the waitresses all moonlight as strippers. ha ha, i doubt it, but they are all unbelievably cute and young. they're also all very sweet, if the service was bad (every once in awhile it happens when you've been somewhere so  many times) it seems it was a kitchen issue and the waitress is quick to apologize.   2. this one is so bad... this is the Chompie's vs. Harlow's theory: as you may realize or heard, this is the place for Tempe locals to hit up after a long night of partying, if you frequent Palo, Casey's, Time Out, etc., you will most likely see any and all of the same cats at Harlow's the next day. that being said, I've heard several guys say, if you're none too proud of who you 'went home with,' you take them to Chompie's instead of Harlow's, since you're less likely to see your friends there. i feel like a jerk just repeating it, but it's not my theory!  anyway, they have tons of plates to choose from and they're all named after 50s-70s movie and tv films or actors. there's the cisco kid, the chill will, the gene special, you get the idea. it's none too pretty to look at, but warm and bustling til they close at 2 p.m. you most likely will have to wait at least 5 to 10 minutes for a table.  i find the food to be a little overpriced for what it is, it seems a greasy spoon like this should be $5 average per plate, but it's more like an $8 average plus coffee or juice. everyone swears by the Eggs Maximilian, a giant tortilla laid flat with eggs, chorizo (optional) green chilies, hot sauce, sour cream and potatoes piled on top. it's HUGE. and, to be honest, I'm a connoisseur of Mexican food, I'd like to think, and for a place like this, their refried beans and tortillas are pretty good ( i get the basic eggs and hashbrowns with a side of tortillas and beans and it's soooo good!)  so, that's that on the Harlow's. p.s. not long after hearing that second theory, a gentlemen friend suggested chompie's one morning, i was like dang, oh no he didn't!

Oh Golfland Sunsplash! Back in the 80s, this place was the bee's knees... if you didn't have your birthday party here, man you were whack as they come.  i recently returned for a round of miniature golf (they have three courses to choose from and is WAAAY better than the courses offered at Castles and Coasters and Fiddlesticks, hands down) and still had a blast.  as for the water park , it's super fun and they're adding new attractions all the time. although, i heard they're having a crackdown on the lazy river and you can only go around twice before they drag you out...how lame - but at thispoint it's all heresay and conjecture as i have not been to the water park portion in some time.  um, i would advise water-friendly shoes (i know they're dorky) because walking around a full day on the fry an egg on the sidewalk pool-texture deck is KILLER on your poor feet. and in summer peak months the lines for the slides can get hair pulling long - especially when you're surrounded by 10 year olds with sticky ice cream faces.

i used to love going here over blockbuster, they had a bigger selection of obscure or indy films and you could keep every movie for a week. well, now Blockbuster has upped their selection and you can keep movies for like two weeks before the creepy robot lady starts leaving threatening messages on your cell phone over "Half Nelson."  but the real deal breaker was when i rented probably one of the worst remakes of all time, a little cinematic gem called "Planet of the Apes." thinking i had returned it, they kept hassling me and i kept telling them to lay off of me with their stalin-like regime - i didn't have their damn crappy movie (about 8 months later i was moving and discovered the video in my trunk -oops). regardless! they sent me to collections for a grand total of like $200, when i would have gladly paid for the movie.  i paid the bloody bill and moved on... to blockbuster. i finally caved and went back after about two years only to be asked by the goth kid staring at the computer screen,  "Um, do you still have, uh....planet of the apes?" i could have punched the poor black-haired social outcast. but i restrained. anyway, EVERY time i go there, i get asked about the monkey movie and EVERY time i tell them, this "this is really a sore subject, but here's what happened..."  EVERY TIME.  plus, last time i went, the kids forgot to pull the security thingies out and i couldn't open the case. BOOOO hollywood!

if you live in tempe, this has to be a staple to your menu. good, fat sandwiches on thick slices of toasted bread. always have new england chowder - and you get the bread bowl even if you get it to go, very nice. i had the greek salad and thought it was kind of bad. but other than that, this place is killer. usually super packed during lunch time because of proximity to ASU, and parking can be a pain during those time.

actually really like this place, but rarely come here. probably cause it's on the Mill "strip" and just about everything else there is not like this place at all.  this is a fairly large pub complete with brass accented bar and hardwood floors. the food is super English/Irish with Shepard's Pie and other "meat and potatoes" fare. not cheap, but it's unique and good, so it's worth it.  there is live music every weekend, and possibly during the week, too. i think weekends after 10 they start charging a cover, but it's only like $3. it can get really loud inside, especially with the live music, but thankfully, there's a huge outdoor courtyard area with a bar, which is where i spend my time there.  the crowd can be college, but not obnoxious college, it's a laid back crowd of students and older folk, too. the place can get pretty busy during the semester, and sometimes the wait at the bar is frustrating.  all in all, it's a cool place, especially among all the other trashy, club-like places that abound in that area. i only knock off a star for the terrible indoor acoustics and bar service during peak hours, which can't really be helped anyway.

I was really impressed with this place. It reminded me a lot of Plaid in Tempe, but without the too-hip-for-you attitude from cashier/servers and dingy, cut-corner atmosphere.  the food was delish- i had vegan crab puffs (WOW, these were good!) and a tofu noodle bowl. the tofu was cooked perfectly, but i agree with Blythe down there that it's not "healthy" vegan- it's a lot of fried, greasy stuff. also, good call on that's a wrap in phoenix - deeelish!

not a bad joint, but the crowd tends to be too college for me.  they used to have a lot more pool tables, and now calling it a cue club for two tables seems misleading. the music on weekends is usually top 40s with an emphais on hip hop, and they play accompanying videos on the big screen tvs behind the bar. i imagine this switches up to sports during the day or weekday nights.  drinks prices are average. the line to get in late on fri and sat not a big deal, goes pretty quick and possibly a small cover ($3-$5).

Good, but not amazing, "traditional arizona " mexican food.  for some reason, i've had about five friends who have worked here as servers, and they all stuck around for at least a year, so i imagine the owners/managers are pretty cool.  on sundays they have discounts on pitchers of beer and margaritas all day. the food is good and relatively inexpensive, and the select apps are half off during normal HH times.   located right on hardy and university (wedged between Cornish Pasty and Cheba Hut) it's convenient and has good service.

Ok, this place rocks. I don't have horses, and I don't' know why there's feed and horse supply store in the middle of downtown Tempe, but if you have dogs or cats, get your food here!  they feature pet foods that don't have fillers like corn, or bad ingredients for your pups like soy. i get 50 lb. bags of quality dog food for $15! It's not a pretty package like Iams or whatever, but it's good for them and the workers will gladly tell you why. You can also get vaccines for your pets, instead of paying for a $50 vet visit along with the cost of the shot, just buy it yourself and do it yourself, the workers will explain that to you to.  and, if you're a 110 girl buying a bag of dog food that's half your weight, they'll take it out to the car and put it in your trunk for you : )

i was really unimpressed with the pizza here. it's conveninetly located, but never very busy, even at it's prime location by a bar even on a friday night. cheap slices, and easy to get in and out of, but of all the many, many people i know who frequent this area, none of them really ever eat there.

this is not the place to go for fabulous mexican food. it's not bad, but it's like going to applebee's and expecting a great steak.  i really only like their happy hour cause it comes with free food. mini chimis, chips and salsa and taquitos and such are free if you sit in the bar. i haven't been in awhile, and all locations are different, but from i remember, margaritas weren't a HH special, which is pretty much blashpemy. for friday HH there is usually a DJ.   this particular location has been going through some heavy renovations, as there will be a light rail stop literally on their patio doorstep (p.s. the otuside area is HUGE), so imagine in the next few years this plca will have a fairly large crowd for HH all week long.

I've been here severa times in the last month it seems, and the employees here rock!   it all started when i purchased a 20 " Hot Rod. after riding a friend's and falling in love, over breakfast at Harlow's (across the street) the next day, i made one of the best impulse purchases ever after learning that their moving sale would knock about $30 off.  they have one of the biggest selections of cruisers in tempe, so if you're on the market for one and not sure exactly what you want, this is an excellent place to get an idea what styles are out there (and if you decide to buy, go before the end of the month and take advantage of their relocation sales).  the last cruiser i purchased before the Hot Rod was from Earnhardt Schwinn across the street years ago, and Tempe Bike crushes those guys when it come to customer service/basic coolness. I remember ES having  that, 'if you're not an uber bike enthusiast then we treat you like an idiot or not worth the time' attitude, and when i returned last weekend to check out their stock on banana seats i got the same vibe.  I was just in tempe bike yesterday to drop off a vintage frame i acquired and wanted to get in working order. being simply an appreciator and not an expert, i braced for any snobbery and instead was greeted with a passionate employee who gushed over the chance to work with such a cool frame. i was more than happy to leave my newest love in the hands of someone as excited about this bike as i was. plus, when i called to compare prices on a clean/tune up, ES wanted $37 while Tempe Bike was only $30. and despite telling the guy at ES it was a cruiser that needed service, he justified the price by saying they do a full brake valve and gear shift check.... when i pointed out again that it's a cruiser with coaster brakes and no gears, he didn't really have much to say by way of convincing me to take it there instead. all of the sudden i felt like i was in for an oil change and being dragged out to get the spiel on air filters, etc. bottom line, ES was unfriendly and i distinctly felt they were attempting to take advantage... but they did have two rad things tempe bike did not: I heart my bike bells in a rainbow of colors (TB only stocks white and metal) and an all-black schwinn cruiser - like ALL black, down to black rims, all black tires and dark gray writing. though i'm sure TB would order any of those items.

i looove susie's. first off, you order a coke and it comes in the bottle, just like in mexico. second, they have plenty of totally out of skew, no perception wall murals with disporportionate people, also just  like mexico. the food is good and cheap. in fact, they won best inexpensive mexican food in Get Out's eating and drinking awards

ha i thought these were way overpriced for what they were, but there's something to be said for the price of peace of mind and quality of living.  after taxes and "pet rent" i was paying $735 for a tiny one bedroom, but it was beautifully landscaped with tons of tall trees and actual green grass. they're all single level, in groups of four. it was very quiet in general and the old school brick walls muffled almost all noise. the trees kept the place nice and shady, which can help a ton in the mid summer.  i have a dog, so it was nice and convenient to have the park literally right across the street (across 5th). there were always young men playing basketball - always - but they never bothered me and weren't out of control. the traffic got to be kind of loud if you had the windows open, but not horrible.  i had one incident with a mental transient while walking my dog in broad daylight, no less. it scared the crap out of me, but never had a problem after. most people in the park were dog owners, but it was open enough that you could avoid any groups that looked suspect.  the staff was usually pretty friendly, and fixed the probs right away. they seemed real lenient on my final walk through, and said i would be getting a check for my full deposit in the mail in a few weeks (just moved out).  all in all, it's a cute, conveniently located little place, that, when i think of the character and location of it, was worth the price. it was just a little on the small side.

This place is located right on Mill, with a patio that is right in the action.  they gimmick of this primarily college bar is their frozen drinks, which are tossed around in Kwik-E-Mart squishy style windows behind the bar that you can see. they come in plenty of flavors like red, green, orange, etc. seriously, they all taste the same to me, and after a couple they only become recognizable by color.  the frozen drinks are loaded with sugar and everclear (like the HIgh Octane) so it only takes two to feel super drunk and have a real bad stomach ache (which feels even worse the next day).  they also have regular beers and liquor, and even a menu - which i never realized til someone sitting next to me was presented  a hamburger at their table.   overall it's not my style, gimmicky, co-edy and obnoxious, and i only end up here when someone else wants to go here for some reason that i can never fathom.

This place is unbelievably well-run, the owner is very business-like and keeps his parlor well designed with lots of personality and creativity. they have officially moved to Univeristy and Hardy (right across the street from Harlow's) in to a beautiful new, freestanding building. Harley (owner ) and Mondo do beautiful work, i should post some work that they've done on my two best friends ( a Virgin de Guadalupe by Harley in his signature traditional style and a Mexican-tyle piece by Mondo). If you want the best place to get this style of tatooing in Tempe and probably all of pHoenix, come here

this is place is conveniently located right off university and easy and fast to get in and out of.  they aren't open past midnight, even on weekends, so don't waste precious beer o'clock hour trying to snap up booze here.  the staff is super friendly and will remember your face usually after a just a few semi-consecutive visits. for Christmas, i wanted to get a nice bottle for a whiskey connoisseur friend and the guy suggested some bottles just after watching me stare at some and read the labels. it was on special and in a different part of the store so i ended up saving money on something i wouldn't have seen otherwise, very nice.  the wine selection is extensive too, though a little more than say the grocery store. they also carry most juices, energy drinks and even water for the next day...oh, and some snacks.

What the....? I've never yelped house of tricks? For shame! Some of the best meals I've ever had in tempe were at this mill ave. legend. Don't be thrown by the "mill ave." portion of my previous statement - it's far enough back from the p.f. chang's, cue clubs and fat tuesdays to keep the college crowd from interrupting your $34 filet with shouts of "jaegerbombers!" plus, the price point isn't exactly student-friendly (which is why I rarely get to eat here).  That usually means I come here for special occasion meals like birthdays and promotions, which typically entails a bottle of wine, two entrees, an app and a dessert ($100 for two people, easy). But I have, on occasion, come for happy hour drinks at the outdoor, four-sided bar. The restaurant is made up of two early 20th century homes connected by a large wooden deck and spacious patio. Most of the seating is outside, so in the hot or cold months take that into consideration. They have two fireplaces and plenty of heat lamps, but in January I still ate with my coat on. Not sure what sort of relief they have in the summer - though it is shaded by a canopy of trees and has plenty of flowers and greenery to keep you cool...ish.  I've never been disappointed in the food. My sister swears their ahi tuna is the best she's ever tasted (she orders it in any restaurant that offers it). and she must not be the only one because they always have it on the menu, which they otherwise change seasonally. I'm a steak girl myself, but the cold weather of my last visit prompted a short rib bourguignonne order, which was fantastic. Two people in our party did opt for the filet mignon served with coconut milk mashed potatoes (wha...??? Yummers!) and lovey-love-loved it.  The service can be spotty... the bar, host and wait staff was a little green for a Saturday night. bartenders were not rude, but... a tad sophomoric for a place that has $80 bottles of wine on the menu. Our hostess was nice enough to move our table closer to the firepit, but never brought the heat lamp she promised. The server seemed to be on his third night of serving ever - forgot an appetizer and was easily confused and in a hurry - probably waiting to get cut so he could head to a kegger. No one on the staff we interacted with was over the age of 20....seems odd for a fancier place like HoT.   But, for being the only place of this caliber I can think of in all of tempe, I'll take it.

Most of the stuff here is new, not used, and these are NOT thrift store prices. you can randomly find some deals on name brand stuff like Volcom and Lucky jeans, but i don't usually even bother stopping in here anymore.  they have shoes, selection is hit or miss, purses (new and used), jewelry (new), hats (new and used), house wares (new)...they've really expanded -literally and figuratively - in the last 12 years or so since i've been going. don't bother trying to sell something unless it's a really sweet vintage piece or top brand label and with the tags still attached... that's all they will tell you they can take at any given time, yet they must keep it all for themselves because i rarely see that kind of merch out on the floor.

if you don't love this place i don't want to know you... seriously. happy hour has half off glasses of wine, $1 off beers, $5 specialty martinis (the espresso martini is a good post-work pick me up) and half off apps.   try these on your first visit: caprese (tomatoes, basil mozerella and mix of olive oil and balsamic vinegar), the shrimp that comes in the most deilcious sauce you have ever tasted- you only get 5 scrimps, but after you've gobbled em up, use the complimentary bread for dipping, the artichoke.  for dinner: i love the tortellini brigantino, cheese filled torts in a white cream sauce. the voodoo penne is prob one of their most popular and pretty good. polo polo is cheese filled torts in both red and white sauce. if you can spring the bucks, get Luca's Meatballs - so damn a good i can't stand it ($15).  for lunch: i've never had their sandwiches but they sound good. the salads are amazing, like the SoCal Love (it sounds lame i hate saying the words to order it, but it's yummy with avocado and almonds and chicken if you want).  the crowd: all ages, ASU profs side by side with intellectual hipster artist types. no sorority sisters or frat guys here, although it's on the mill strip (thankfully). the staff is all super nice, their all pierced or tattooed and obviously free to show that, so this upscale restaurant gets a bit of an edge, which is nice to see.  i rarely come if it's not happy hour, cause it can get pricey, but the food and atmosphere is dang good. there is live music on weekends and HH is only in the small, quick to get packed bar area.

Wait, what? Caffe Boa, you won me back? After all these years? It's true. The last few times I've been here, I learn more about the new exec chef, who stresses local, local, local, sustainable, organic ingredients. Love that. Yes, the menu has changed quite a bit (even physically, eff that leather-bound monstrosity of wine and food).  A simple, seasonal menu is offered with a few familiar faces (Voodoo Penne, for example). WIN But! My favorite parts are back: the killer happy hour! 7 days a week (plus the always amazing half-off sangria pitchers on Sundays) which allow for $2 off signature cocktails (which right now includes holiday yummers like Maker's Mark infused cider [The Hayride] and Butterfinger rum-laced amaretto, dark chocolate cacao nonsense thingy [The Nutcracker]) as well as half off glasses of wine that are under $10 and $2 off drafts from 4-7. A fantastic HH will win me over every time. WIN. Also, their service has always impressed and that hasn't changed, even in the interim CB and I were on the outs. Always a shout out to the cool-but-never-too-cool servers and bar tenders. These guys and gals have always been fun, friendly and on point. WIN And, one of my most favorite parts of the last few times I stopped in: the music selection. I loved it so much that every time I've asked if it was a Pandora station and if so what is it. Current, mellow, cool, edgy and classy -- sounds impossible but is not. WINWINWIN! So: go. Sit in the bar area (even if you're dining). Go now and enjoy the beautiful xmas tree. Chat up your server and/or bar tender. You won't regret it.

Dear Casey's, Let me just start by saying that  1. I love you, seriously - it's bordering on an obsession.  2. Thank you for getting rid of the terrible horse shoe area to lay brick over that useless sand pit.  3. Please tell your bouncers that I appreciate their taking into account that one third of my income is spent on you every month when not kicking me out for getting too drunk on my birthday; they're always friendly and not only remember my name but don't mind chit-chatting while I wait for friends (along those lines I apologize for carelessly smashing your glasses while hopped up on booze and birthday glory- it was unnecessary and certainly out of line). 4. I know I tease you about your 'hot dog lights,' but during the cold winter months the red heat keeps me nice and warm and I don't miss any of the crowd watching on the patio- which happens to be the only place I can run into colleagues from work, past ASU professors, old friends, current friends, soon-to-be friends, old high school class mates, all in a matter of 20 minutes. 5. Please tell the fish in your lovely pond that I am sorry for "feeding" them beer all those times. Please also tell them I apologize in advance for doing it again this weekend. 6. Please tell your bar staff that I appreciate that they don't make fun of me or charge me some absurb fee for forgetting to close my tab when I stumble out at 2 a.m., and that happens a lot, so I really must congratulate them on their patience and keeping vigil over my precious beer charge card.  That is all for now. Till I write again... Sincerely, Your biggest fan

name changed to "Nate's Place"  how do i explain this joint?  it's been around for quite some time, and since moving nearby, jsut recently began coming up in the radar of nearby dive bars.  pros: i can ride my bike here. the new owner is cool. they do poker tournaments. they do karaoke. for a dive they have nice beers on tap, like harp, guiness, ace pear and kiltlifter. they have food (never tried it, though).   cons: standard stuff that goes along with a dive bar, but that's kind of what makes it fun to go there. my favorite old bar fly is Einstein (so nicknamed by my former roommate for his wild, white hair); he speaks in these sort of half sentences all the time - you get either the first part or the tail end of any thought that happens into his head. he favors the ladies (shocking, i know), and although seems out of it, is surprisingly lucid at 1 a.m. for example, he was going on about a sort of conspiracy theory, and to placate him and being my usual sarcastic self, i commented "ah, i see, it's all coming together now." at which point, whithout missing a beat, he responded, "i don't care if it all falls apart." and launched right back into his half-sentence tale of the collusion de jour. well played, einstien.   anyway, back to cons: it is waaaay too bright inside here for a bar of that caliber. and, the karaoke patrons tend to be the ones trying to take their serious shot at american idol - i heard more sappy pap country love songs and creed than i can handle. i guess i'm used to more upbeat or fun karaoke, not  this, "i'm seriously belting a love song in a dive bar at midnight on the weekend" variety.  it's got outside seating area with tables, but the view is terrible - kyrene road right at baseline in a kind-of strip mall.   more cons:  they only have a beer and wine license... that means no shots... or no shots made with any liquor that has over 12 percent alcohol content or something. weird, right?   the last three times i visited Nate's Place I left either immediately after or before finishing my first beer, and the last straw was a Thursday night when I took my beer on the patio to escape the way-too-loud  creed karaoke to find a very strange group of crack heads. I blatantly studied the dynamic of the group - they were loud and seemingly begging for and def enjoying the attention - and came to the conclusion that the mid to late 20's gentlemen fancied hisself a pimp; I swear to god he even rocked a cane. He dressed white trash meth-ghetto and had what appeared to be a strung out prostitute in tow. I haven't been back since.

who doesn't love a target? i could easily spend $100 if i'm not careful just stopping in for toilet paper or something.  i've really been into their clothes, believe it or not. they've got good, nice shirts for work - they look stylish and fit well enough for the price, and you never want to spend a ton on dumb old work clothes anyway.  i'll occasionally buy shoes here, only to realize that cheap shoes just hurt your feet, bad idea.  not the cheapest place for electronics like TVs, but they have them.

i know people who can do all of their food shopping here. i cannot. i absolutely have to have some things from here (edamame, gyozas, veganaise, grape tomatoes), but i still have to do extra ciricular shopping when i'm done.  this location is pretty small, and i refuse to come on a saturday or sunday if i can help it. workers have always been friendly. free snacks/samples almost every time i've come. nearby shopping makes this location rock - Wildflower and Changing Hands.

this is where the PrincessPrincess goes when she doesn't feel good!  i found this place by sheer open-the-phone-book-and-point luck, and have been going ever since. the docs are honest and helpful, and definitely care about their patients (and their patient's parents).  i particularly was happy with their customer service when i explained over the phone that my dog does not get along with other animals. they have a side door, so when i call, they usher all office pets and other patients out of the hall and lead her in to a room.  recently i called because my dog was around some pet chickens and   i was worried she had gotten fleas or mites or even could have gotten something from their... uh, feces... someone called me back in about an hour to let me know that i had nothing to worry about.  i've always been impressed by their staff and docs.

i have to drop another star on this update and here's why. the major surgery i mentioned in my last update (ACL repair) turned out to be a tad on the extreme end of the treatment scale.   the way the diagnosis and treatment was presented to me was: surgery and rehabilitation (by a paid therapist, not on your own) -- end of story. and if you don't do the surgery, she will eventually blow out her other knee(s) because she not putting weight on the injured one. i was pressured to schedule tests to prep her for said surgery and the idea of surgery at all was just so nonchalant. in fact the dr said he's done this surgery on both of his own dogs and does these types of surgeries on dogs all the time and this injury is quite common. it was somehow alarmist and blase at the same time.  I dont' doubt that that is all true (including the possibility of injury to other knees), but a bit misleading in the way that this is a major, major surgery with major, major recovery time. Also, after doing my own research and finding out that this was 1. going to be anywhere from a $3k-$5k surgery, and 2. it's not at all as "absolutely necessary as i was led to believe, I felt this was not at all a good choice for such an aged dog.  so after researching it a bit on my own i felt a little upset about not being informed about the other ways you can treat this (your own rehab efforts, meds like phycox and hylox). only when i called to cancel dozer's follow up appt for tests to prep her for this surgery did Finch call back to recommend the "DIY" rehab tips. (And he does personally call back to check in on your pet after appts, new meds have been started, etc., which i think is great.)  In fact, I have always liked Dr. Finch, and i don't know that he's deserving of the other reviewer's remarks (come on: smelling of alcohol on the job? please. and his demeanor hardly seems capable of rude or rough) - he's not unprofessional or uncaring, and his manner is rather soothing, but i just feel that trust has been majorly broken.   not to mention at a previous appt before this whole ACL business he spent five minutes going on and on about this revolutionary new dog food that's great for joints (dozer also has bad hips) even though i kept interrupting him to say we weren't interested in it, all while staring at a huge poster ad for the food behind his head on the cabinet.  after these last two incidences, which have made me think back on still other minor ones, i feel that their priorities are a little out of order, and am now in the market for a new vet.

pretty darn tasty messican food, and almost fast enough to be called fast food. but this aint' no filiberto's. this place is packed at lunchtime every day of the week. the tamales are delicious - that's my measure of good mexican food i think... anyone can produce a good bean and chees burrtio, but if you can kill it on a tamale, you know what the eff you're doing!

i first heard about this place when my BF at the time gave me these gorgeous day of the dead skull barrettes for christmas. they were really very nicely detailed and so unique i demanded he tell me where he purchased them.   it took me almost a year to check out Go Kat Go for myself, which, unfortunately, was 1. on my lunch break and 2. in a hurried attempt to find a gift for someone else.  there is so much stuff packed into this medium-sized store i felt overwhelmed. my random and exasperated-yet-impressed walking about was clearly obvious to the owner, who asked me if i needed help three times.   since i had no idea what i wanted - a calendar of traditional mexican art? a coffee table book on luche libres? a shirt of the virgen de guadalupe? tiki glass set? a car freshener that looks like a steak and smells like BBQ meat? a skull and crossbones makeup travel case? custom and locally-made hair bows and flowers? -  on the third offer i took her up, attempting to explain what my friend liked. oddly enough, she laughed, "we have so much stuff here, even i lose track." so we scoured her shop together, lifting up items for approval/opinion from the other.   after 25 minutes, i had, on the front counter, a "maybe" pile, a "definitely" pile and a "for myself" pile. my friend LOVED her gifts and i drove away with an awesome St. Otto, the Patron Saint of Parking Spaces air freshener hanging from my rear view mirror. the owner was a doll and i can't wait to come back when i have more time and to look for cool stuff for me.

im giong to say this right up front - i am not a sushi person. i don't *not* like sushi, and (this sounds ridiculous) but the mean reason i don't eat more of it is because i *hate* trying to jam giant rolls that are just slightly bigger than my mouth into it, and try to tactfully chew around seaweed and rice that i feel i could choke on any minute.  plus. it really bothers me when people say they *love* sushi and then order a bunch of cream cheese filled crap (with a pink "martini" on the side). however, im not adventurous enough to just order the more traditional stuff because i have no idea what it is, how it tastes or what i would even like. however, when my boss wanted to stop for some on the way back to an event, i trusted his taste (and was not starving) so i told him to order whatever he liked and i would try anything at least once.  he is def a sushi person, and for a beni hana (i was always under the impression that this place has a ...silly? cliche?... reputation, he said this particular location served great sushi. he explained that the sushi chefs at the bar are always there, every night he comes (which is a lot) and the raw fish is pretty good for being vegas and all. we trried ahi, yellowtail and salmon. i was stoked to see they came out as simply cuts of raw fish - no cream chesse in sight. and was even more stoked that i liked it!  the service was great, and the restaurant itself is pretty impressive. located right in the hotel, you enter into an entirely new realm where the lighting is dark and there is flowing streams of water, bridges, a rainfall stream falling from the ceiling and bamboo. definitley an experience type setting. i would go back, or maybe even try a benihana in phoenix - now that i know what to order!

What's there left to say when a place has more than 700 reviews?? I'll be quite frank: it was on my must-do list before I left Phoenix and moved abroad, so I called up some willing participants and planned an early weeknight dinner (630ish) to curtail the wait.  We put in our name and bee-lined for Bar Bianco (see my review). Waited just about an hour, if not less (it was June, after all, not exactly Phoenix's popular season). The pizza was good. Really good, in fact. And everyone was very happy with their pizzas and the service.   Now for the frank part. I've been gone a year now and have a long list of restaurants I MUST eat at the next time I come home for a visit. Bianco's isn't on it. Cibo is.   That is all.

i had no idea durant's was so cool baby when i decided i had to go there. here's the story.  in my last semester of college i did a huge invetigative thing on don bolles (the reporter who was murdered here in '76). anyway, when interviewing all the old school reporters who were tailing the mob back then, the name Durant's came up every time. most of the hotels, restaurants, coffee shops they talked about for insider tips and secret rendevous didn't exist anymore, but this one did. so i thought how cool it would be to see this part of az history.  two years later i finally made it (god, i've been out of college two years? whew). it was nothing like i expected from the seedy stories i was told that went on here 30 years ago.  first, the entrance through the kitchen kind of rocks - it's hotter in there than it was outside in august, the chefs look annnoyed and it feels awkward, but  damnit where else can they charge nearly $20 for a caesar salad and make you walk through a hot ass kitchen to do it?  i had heard the martinis were the bee's knees here, so i ordered one, with vodka, dirty. i'm not just saying this - i was ready to have to defend my love of this place despite their overpriced whatever because i had decided two years ago this place was awesome - that was one damn.good.martini. not too dirty,  not too strong, BIG and about $10 (happy hour price). i almost didn't get it because i was hot and thirsty and dirty martini didn't sound refreshing, but it was somehow still delicious.  i only made it to the lounge, which is probably where i'll spend most of my future visits. long bar, great plush, vintage decor, wonderful service. the server was unpretentious, friendly, chatty and professional, right down to how he offered their dessert options. you know how most servers disinterestedly prattle off "double chocolate lava cake, ooey-gooey caramel cheesecake" ? not this guy, he sincerely offered up some of the most delicious concoctions as though he handmade each one as his chosen form of artistic expression.  this place is a time warp. it' still dominantly male business crowd, but i didn't let the polos, silver hair and understated expensive shoes and watches kill my mood (it was tuesday at 5:30, what can you expect?). plus it's on central, and i feel it's my duty to go uot of my way to support biz's stuck in the light rail construction mess.

I give this place five stars because you have to be as unAmerican as they come not to love going to a baseball game. seriously, i don't follow sports, certainly not baseball, and my atttention span lasts about 8 seconds when it's on TV... but come one, a live game in the stadium with the 7th Inning Stretch and kids running in place as video hot dogs, that'sabout as fun as it gets.  Real grass, and a roof that detracts to let the sun shine in when the weather allows. If it's the dead of summer and you know the roof will be closed - bring a sweater becuase they keep this place FREEZING. You'l look like an idiot hiking from your car 10 blocks with a cardigan but i'll take that over three hours of goosebumps and teeth chattering.   p.s. it will always be "BOB" to me, too.

My burning question after walking out the door of Barrio Cafe on a Thursday afternoon was "was it overpriced?" That appears to be several other reviewers' issue with this place, and I'll answer that right up front: NO.  Firstly, it's not Tex Mex, New Mexican or Sonoran style Mexi food. It's classic, middle of Mexico style with appropriate innovations or surprises that really are worth stepping out of the tradition (i.e., craisans in the guac).  Which brings me to the other highly debated Yelp issue -- $11 guacamole. We came for lunch, so did not get the table side presentation, so right off that seems like a bust on the price. However, it was fucking tasty. I don't know, stuff that like normally infuriates me, but I did not think it was out of place here. The chips that came with it were awesome. Handmade, thicker tortilla pieces that weren't too greasy.  The service was great and unlike other reviewers, we had zilch wait. Here's the thing, if you really want to try this place and know there's a crazy long wait, suck it up and wait and don't complain about it, don't go on a Friday night, don't go at all, or try to go when is likely to be less busy, like a weekday lunch or early dinner.   I loved my cochinta pibil street tacos. The slow roasted pork was rad, the cotija cheese wonderful and the optional fries were a fun touch (i was not a fan of either sauce that came with them, some sort of spicy chipotle ketchup and a weird mustard). My sister was not in love with her poblano chile torta. It was oozing with cheese and she didn't think it had a "meaty" quality to make for a good sandwich. The bread it came out on, a crusty French loaf, was an interesting touch and good.   Would I come back? Yes. Would I tell others to go? Absolutely. Will I go on a Saturday night? No. I hate waiting an hour for a table so will go when I don't have to do that. Problem solved.

I'm definitely NOT a hangout at a coffee shop kinda girl, but if I *was* this is the place I would set up shop to read, write, draw, browse a magazine, meet a date or just people watch.  I met bonnie here pre-Chez Nous HH (that turned into evening since I got off work late) because my coffee shop connoisseur friend was posting up there until I got off work down the street. I admit I am directionally challenged to degree that is not only embarrassing, but debilitating. If you feel for me, take heed - I drove past it not once but two times. Add to that the light rail construction (it is right on central) and my post-work brain just about exploded. Poor bonnie had to take three calls from me before going out to the street to wave me in like an airplane.  But, once safely in the parking lot, there were ample spaces and I was surprised to see that pane bianco was right next door! Then it all made sense - why that phoenix cool-baby marketing rep asked me a date here, why so many people that I would not imagine know about these kinds of things seem to love talking about lux. It's right next door to prob one of the busiest/coolest places to pick up sandwiches for up-and-coming downtowners (uptowners?).   Well, although bianco was long-closed, lux was happenin' at 7 at night. there was plenty of comfy seating (two couches, and easily 7 or 8 arm chairs) plus a long table seemingly designated for setting up laptops. The staff seemed friendly and nice, and I really liked that the shelves for placing flyers was inset into the counter where you order - still visible but not at all the messy eyesore they inevitably end up being.  Ok, now for my favorite part - the clipboards that hang on stings against the wall so that patrons can hang their own sketches, drawings, paintings - whatever. (miss bonnie herself added a RAD sketch of a sexy bunny-man, I suggest you check it out).  Sorry to say I did not taste the coffee or the treats, so I can't speak to that. But, I would most definitely go back to do so.

wow, i feel exactly like Calamari F. down there... I really want to love Last Chance, but I just don't think I'm the elbow -jab-to-the-face-over-a-pair-of-designer-jeans kind of shopper.  the finds can be amazing, absolutely, but you have to be the type of person who thinks of shopping as more of a sport and eat or be eaten activity.   i thought if i avoided the weekend it would be better, but no way, this place is like a constant zoo and the lines (for dressing rooms and check out) are way too long for me to deal with. i usually end up there when shopping for a special occasion, like when i want to look super hot in a killer designer dress, but don't feel like shelling out the bucks for another stupid wedding.  and yes, this is basically where designer clothes go before they end up in the big rack in the sky, so be sure to check for major stains, rips and broken zippers. i've never encountered someone stealing a find out of my basket, but it would not surprise me in the least.

i think this place is great for not a special occasion, but say, a better night than usual... it's right in downtown scottsdale, but around the center for the arts area, so you get some hipster types along with the club types. the bar has swiveling glass panels to let lots of fresh air in. it's also very loud! they have a big patio, and this place is always packed, all during the week and even on weekends. no reservations, either. there doesn't seem to be someone helping you get seated, so it' s like you have to stare down the diners and wait for them to leave and then pounce on their chairs. the food is pretty good, and way less than you'd expect for such a hip, fancy dig. the drinks are extremely expensive though, so come with some cash, especially if you like speciatly drinks.

i know i have a bad sense of direction and tend to get really disoriented in huge retail places with large crowds, but this is ridiculous. once i was trapped in here for about 30 minutes before, defeated, i went in to a calendar store (i never sawy it before or again) to ask the kid how the hell to get out.  it's got three levels, sort of. sometimes there are just mini stairs of 8 or 10 for aesthetic purpose or to confuse people like me into thinking you've changed levels ...or not....  they have usual mall staples, AE, victoria secret, Gap and then the designer stuff like Tifanny's, Gucci, Coach. It's nice that they've put it all in one mall so you know what to expect:  if you know that's how you shop you know where to go; if you know that's not what you can afford or care to spend your money on, you can avoid it - and the aforementioned type of people who do like that whole high-end shopping thing.

i guiltily admit i havne't been inside this store in a loooong time, and it keeps shrinking! i'm just glad it's surviving, i hear rumors of its closing all the time. a tempe staple, prob higher prices than ZIa, which is just down the street, but i think the vibe here is cooler, and not as corporate as Zia's.

every time i go to vegas i inevitably end up at this bar. it is def not like going to the strip (and is not located on it), but more like your neighborhood dive. two things: shots of ass juice ($3 each or 3 for $15! ha ha) and bacon martinis. priceless.... from what i recall, which i usually end up there at about 4 a.m. so don't hold me to it, there's at least one pool table and a great juke box. i like this bar when i'm sick of the disneyland over the top-ness of the strip.

the crowd is def of the 'i'm hip and sexy" variety, but if that's not your scene, you're not going to feel out of place... when i got  attitude from the 16-year-old hostess  and i scanned the patrons i was like "oh, great, it's gonna be like THAT," but i easily struck up a conversation with the table next to us when my company left me alone for several minutes to go to the bathroom (kind of impossible not to eavesdrop when you are practically bumping elbows and you have to pull your drink away from the edge of the table when someone needs to get by so their rear end or purse doesn't knock it over).  all that said, the burgers are delicious and the fries are amazing (get the mixed order if you're not sure about the sweet potato fries, bu i guarantee you'll love them with the chipotle dip it comes with).   the ground beef is organic and the delux bruger features applewood bacon-infused patties and gruyere cheese. not the place to go if you want a ton of options - the burger is the star and you have a choice of two. i did have one of their salads and it was very good and very big.   one friend who tried it did not like the baguette-style bun, but that's the only complaint i've heard on the joint.  on to the really important stuff -- booze. i take it back, the menu is huge, but that's because they have so many beers! including one of my favorite "special treat" beers, Framboise Lambic (raspberry dessert beer). they're milkshakes ain't too shabby, either.  yes, i'ts a little cramped in there, but it helps off set the very chicly-designed look and cool baby attitude to seem more like a chatty, happy diner... you know? except this diner doesn't have smashed fires on the floor and a gum-chewing waitress.

i came after hours for drinks at the bar here after a biz party in the area. located in the Hotel Clarendon, which has been around for a very long time but has def gotten in a cool baby face lift recently.  the bar is uber chic but fun every once in a while for that scene. as an added note, the hotel is an important part of AZ history, as an Arizona Republic reporter was murdered in the parking lot, by car bomb, for his work covering the mob in phoenix (yes, phoenix in the 70s was run by a serious network of greedy officials with mob ties). he was the first American reporter to be killed on U.S. soil in retaliiation for his work.  that is your AZ history lesson for the day. camus kicks ass, that is all.

not the typical mexi food... this place is more like gourmet style mexi food. and delicious.   way out in east mesa (the boon docks as far as i'm concerned), this huge rest. gets packed every weekend. this is seriously some award-winning food. like the pan seared chicken in ancho chile peach glaze, or the chicken mole. i believe all their ingredients are organic, but i can't seem to find anything to attest to that online, so don't hold me to it. if you want yummy, upscale mexi food, this is the joint.

A lot of people call this an easy hike, though I find it to be rigorous. I'm reasonably in shape and regularly exercise, but really unless you HIKE/CLIMB regularly you'll find this to be challenging.   My first attempt at Camelback was last August. We did the Cholla Trail side. Yeah, I'm a dummy. But we started just before sunrise and had plenty of water. But I wasn't mentally prepared (I had heard it was easy) for it and it was just too hot. About one-third of the way I tapped out since I was getting dizzy and lightheaded and refused to push it and end up being that hiker who comes out of Camelback via helicopter because I passed out and fell off. I have since been back three more times (never in that kind of heat again, I do NOT recommend it) and summited each time (always Cholla, considered the easier trail).  The terrain is easy at the start (for the novice hiker), with rock or wood block steps and a well-traveled, roomy dirt trail. But once you hit about one-third mark, it narrows and you start using all fours like a monkey to scramble over the big rocks. By the time you get to the final third you are straight up rock climbing. I have trouble following the spray painted dots to stay on track. If there aren't people around to follow, I inevitably end up at a dead end and have to go back and try again.   I have no fear of heights, but there are times that you're negotiating around and over rocks with a drop-off waiting for you if you misstep. Kind of freaks me out each time. The summit area is large and offers fantastic views. Bring a sandwich in your bag, your ipod or a book and hang out a while, it's quite nice.   I've seen small children (as young as six) and I've seen small dogs (including a puppy Chihuahua who literally rolled down most of the big rocks, poor dog) but I wouldn't want to be responsible for either. 12 and up is more appropriate and medium-sized dogs used to climbing/trails. Thanksgiving weekend I saw a lot of elderly family members, kids and others obviously from out of town and not at all prepared for a hike (flip flops, no water). Don't drag your poor parents visiting from Michigan up Camelback, please. Unless they are used to somewhat rigorous hikes, you're going to end up with a hospital visit on your hands at worst; angry, tired, dirty, dehydrated and sore family members at best.   Hikers range from serious (you'll see them running up and down the mountain) to novice to everywhere in between. Everyone is friendly and says "hi" as they pass by. And everyone offered water or asked if I was ok as I hung out in the shade to cool down when I attempted to climb in August. As long as you come prepared (water, water, water) and know what you're in for, you'll have a good time.

yep, two stars, but it's not my style at all. in fact, scottsdale in general is not my style. i hit this place up at about 10:30 or 11 on a Friday, and indeed it was a line and crowded inside. I can't remember if we were pulled out of line or not, but if they do that for girls, then that's about the only thing this place has going for it. there are few tables that line the walls, and from what i remember four and a half foot railing that squares off an area for dancing, i guess? but it's so small that people end up dancing wherever and count on getting bumped in to by enough posing muscle heads and drunk girls that $10 worth of your $12 drink has been spilled on someone's Tru Religion jeans.

yep, good ol' simple home cooking, and by 'home cooking' i mean back when no one cared that there was about three cups of butter in per serving.  if you've never gone, don't be scared off by all the butter references, it's not that bad. the place is teeny tiny, and our table of two had to wait about 10 minutes for a place, parties of more than four, you'll probably have to get split up.   the omelettes are wonderful, and the rosemary home fries are too good. the bacon is so good.. i can't even describe it. let me stress i am NOT a pork fan, and rarely eat it. i never eat bacon from a restaurant since i'm so picky about it. everyone raved about it here, so i dived in and thought, 'what have i been missing my whole life?' ha ha, yeah, i has an awakening of pork love right in the middle of the joint! seriously, it's unbelievable. it's worth the trek no matter where you're coming from, especially on a sat morning. afterward we checked out a small famer's market that was going on right up the street, and then popped in Circles records and tapes, also within walking distance.  ***Update 3/8 I just went over the weekend and we waited more than 45 minutes. i was ok with it, but i was with someone who does not really place value on waiting a little longer for great food, which kind of put a damper on things. def do not bring someone here who is not willing to wait for a good thing.

I would love to give a sterling 5-star review for Carly's - I love the atmosphere, the dcor (hand-drawn cartoons on the tables were awesome), the artsy vibe and the location - but I just can't.   The first time I came, it was off an extended happy hour at the Roosevelt - which is conveniently within walking distance. A friend ordered the hummus and flatbread, which to my starved being were the most delicious I had ever tasted. I also drunkenly ordered an organic-vodka martini - the last thing I needed was a martini! - that tasted, as I recall, OK.   it was after another happy hour visit to the Roosevelt that I returned to Carly's with visions of that luscious hummus and Plaid-like vibe dancing in my head, and making my mouth drool. Of a much more sober disposition, I actually studied the menu and was severely shocked.   First, the prices. $7+ for a Stella? What the hell? And that dubious organic martini - it wasn't on the menu...did I imagine that? - Well, any martini was $10-12 ?! Is this Durant's? It definitely wasn't THAT good of a martini.   I quickly found my hummus/pita app. and ordered a large portion, growing decidedly more disappointed/heartbroken with the entre options. Nothing, and I mean nothing, sounded even remotely appetizing. It was all very rich yet bland-sounding. Does that make sense? Like brie and turkey on Panini bread... Eh, ok. I was hoping it would be like Roosevelt, where you order the grilled cheese and tomato soup with reservation, and then are blown away. Sad to report - not so.  However, I was a huge fan of the veggie chips that came with our hummus and flatbread (which, thank god, was as delicious as I kind-of-remembered). No problems with the service, but from the rest of the reviews, it sounds EXACTLY like Plaid, except downtown...and with a way less-tasty menu.  So, $50 later, we'd had a mediocre couple of entrees, an appetizer, no buzz and some leftovers that are still sitting in my fridge a week later. Do'h!   that really sucks, because I think they have the foundation for a restaurant I would adore and go out of my way to go to and want to support - extensive beer selection, great ambiance, perfect location, local ownership - Please Carly's, can I petition for some better quality/more adventurous food options? I'll even then pay for the overpriced beer without complaint.  *Editor's Note : Seriously, does anyone else think the beer purchased at Tops is always about 7 degrees too warm? It's cool enough to drink, but warm enough to not be refreshing, and it drives me crazy.   And, hang on, I'm not done: What the hell makes a martini organic anyway? Non-pesticide-infused, no-hormones-added-potatoes for the vodka?   ...Highly dubious, indeed.

Having champagne taste but a Champagne of Beers budget is a real drag sometimes.   $15 mixed drinks can go kick rocks and $12 apps that feed one can take a flying leap. That's why I adore happy hour. Remember when Tempe Caffe Boa had a real, real good one? You got the hip but sophisticated atmosphere, great eats and drinks, and could walk away well-fed and pretty buzzed without having buyer's remorse the next day when you realized you spent your week's lunch money.  Well Café ZuZu you are the new mecca for my budget conscious but discernable palate. I have always adored my visits to Valley Ho - I'm a suck-suck-sucker for modern design and décor and a stroll over the grounds and through the lobby are like a Mad Men fan's dream: the cozy fireplace surrounded by couches for relaxing with your drink, the lounge-y area just outside the bar is intimate, comfy and gorgeous - appropriate for a date or a small gathering of friends -- the open layout means you can look from one end of the hotel to the other and all the way up to the third floor ceiling. The music was 60s lounge and energetic without killing the easy vibe. Oh, did I mention the $3 drinks and food menu?  This is really impressive. Three bucks a pop can get you a single serving of braised short ribs (juicy, tender and falling right off the bone), or some mini grilled cheese sandwiches of brie, green apple and fig jam (I'm a huge fan of Postino's prosciutto bruschetta, and this reminded me of that, the perfect blend of salty and sweet but even more buttery and savory, and with a hint of tart) or a decently sized prime rib sandwich w/ au jus...to name a few items. On the drinks side, I love the variety. Most HH mixed drink menus are all "martinis" that are neon green or hot pink and sickly sweet. Not here - get a refreshing Blackberry Bramble or Gin Fizz (that's two of six mixed drinks on special) or a glass of wine (about 4-5 choices) for just three dollars. I ate and drank to my delight and spent $15. Um, wow.   Service was great - friendly and competent and not at all weird about our ordering 2-3 drinks at a time to take advantage of the deal, or deciding to order yet another appetizer because they're just so damn cheap.  Oh ZuZu, thank you! Every pauper wants to feel like a princess, five times a week, from 4-7.

Probably the most gorgeous library I've ever been in. designed by Will Bruder (SMoCA...the super modern-looking lime and yellow condos on university), I stopped in finally to kill some time post-work, pre-happy hour.  It's uber modern, with shade screens lining the outside and tons of natural light inside. At the center are two glass elevators the rise out of a black-bottom reflecting pool on the ground floor. The center of the building is open all the way to the ceiling, and the 2nd-5th floors wrap around the open space. It's pretty breathtaking....and my only problem is with these neon, 80's-looking lights they have everywhere (lining the top of the elevators, as signs for sections like "periodicals" and "teen center"). It's like they were added as an afterthought by someone who thought all the design elements were nice, but too subtle, and they had to punch it up and make it look 'cool.' Disappointing.  Also, on the summer equinox, or the first day of summer, there are specially-placed skylights that create the illusion of flames inside the library when the sun hits them at noon. I have to check out this phenomenon, but it is def on my list. Plus, they have a Rare Book Room, a room designated to AZ history, a photo art "gallery" (ok, it's a small room, but awesome) and a Book Art 'gallery.' For a lit/book/word nerd such as myself, this library is now one of my favorite places in phx.

The food is fantastic, the only reason i detract a star is for ambiance. it's all down home, country themed (country as in floral curtains, not music). and it's popular with the over 50 crowd.... so, not my breakfast joint of choice on that per say, but the food is rad.  the other day i had what i can only compare to eggs benedict, except instead of an english muffin it was a puff pastry, and instead of ham there was crab meat. whoa, that was intense...delicious, but intense.  i love that when you order ice tea or water, they bring the whole carafe so you can refill at your own pace.  i can't help but feel a twang of sympathy for those poor waitresses in the golf shirts, pleated khaki shorts and loafers... it's kind of cute, but really just sort of unflattering and dorky - but not cute dorky. and my mom swears one of the waitresses had a black eye -- very off-putting when she's rocking dockers and socks with loafers...

Like a lot of you, i too, was upset when i finally got to shady's after hearing about it for so long - upset that i waited that long to go, that is.  i always refer to it as a 'dive' but it's really not. but it's not quite a pub or tavern, but it's small and intimate and has a killer jukebox- with tons of the Cure - and not the hits album, if you know what i mean.  Julie is my all time favorite afternoon bartender, she super sweet and will always chat you up - so don't hesitate to stop in by yourself after work for a drink if you're eager to check it out.   on the weekends it gets crowded fast since it's on the small side, but it's a hip crowd that i agree with everyone again that is not the least bit pretentious, so you're not mad about the tight squeeze.

I went back to Shady's on my last visit home and it's just as great as I remember. We dropped in around 2pm on a Sunday because of all the random things I miss about the US, it's cheap pool games in dark bars with juke boxes.  In the case of THIS bar, it's FREE pool games during the day, which my sister and I took full advantage of for about an hour and a half as we pumped more and more change into the (still) fantastic jukebox. I can't express how nice it is to go to a familiar haunt and see that everything you loved about it is still there. Thanks, Shady's. One final note: I forgot to tip the bartender when I paid for the first round of drinks, which I was absolutely mortified about but he was SUPER COOL about when I went back up as soon as I realized. Classy move, bartender :)

i had no idea what to expect from a paper studio, especially not being very "arty." but that's why this place is so rad... they have lists and lists of classes, everything from book binding, collage making - really cool collages, not like magazine cut outs of words like "lucious" and "kinky" rubber cemented to a board. so they SHOW you what you can do with all this stuff. they even have a book art gallery- seriously, how cool is that? a national, rotating collection from artists that will blow your mind with thier definition of "book art."  now on the retail stuff - piles and piles of really cool prints. they have tons of supplies and pieces laying all over the place to inspire you once you find a print or color you like. even something like making your own invitations becomes way cooler, cause you're not limited to what the stay at home mom or martha stewart types tastes' the way it is at micheal's or joann's.  you know those poster-sized framed wall art pieces at urban outfitters for liek $50? well, you can buy the same size cut out of the kind of patterns for about $1.50, frame it yourself and hang it up and ta-da, your walls have art and you spent like $10, maybe? sa-weet.  if you're really dedicated, you can even print your own stuff on their old school printers - like the kind you hand crank. you can make your own, say, wedding invites from start to finish - including making the paper from scratch and hand lettering and printing.  plus, the owners are very, very cool. husband and wife small biz owners who are making a living doing what they love! you can't go wrong supporting that.

it took me a long time to 'get it' about this place. i still don't think it's the end all of urban design or decor, but at least it's not too shabby looking.  i probably went there three or four times loathing the crowds (still do, that won't change) and just picking up 'fun' stuff that grabbed my attention. it wasn't until i stopped having roommates and started actually wanting to invest some of my own money into non-thrift store furniture that i "got it."  it's not quality stuff, and it will wear and tear pretty quickly ( i picked up a coffee table/ end table set in a dark faux wood finish and after one move the edges were all worn down to expose the light brown underneath-boo) but that's the beauty, the set was only $35, so who cares? before ikea the only other option for semi-cheap furniture that didn't totally suck around here was target, and they were way overpriced for the quality. i've now noticed that the target pieces have not only begun to look more clean and hip in their designs, but go down in price too, so double-plus-good all around.  p.s. i will never get over how weird this is, but i LOVE their swedish meat balls, and their only $1.99. oh, and i hear their $1.99 breakfast is pretty killer, too.

I'm really into this bar, but only every now and then. they get a lot of the same kinds of requests, and they usually play them on rotation each weekend, so i wouldn't recommend coming every week.  the musicians are good and have lively personalities. to make a request you write the song on a bar napkin and walk it up to the stage and drop it on the piano top with a couple of bucks (or more, depending on how badly you want to hear your song).  p.s. unless you're a dummy dont' fall for the UofA v. ASU fight song battle. they do this every time i go in, and basically drunken bros try to "outbid" one another to hear one song over the other (during the rose bowl, etc, the respective teams are inserted). anyway, i've seen some poor way too drunk fool plop down $100 in effort to have his team song played over another - pretty smart gimmick for the players, pretty crappy for the dude who has to to realize, "wait, did i really pay $100 to hear a song last night?"  i think the drink prices are steep here, but it's a fun time and you're getting live entertainment.

gotta love an independent book store in a world of huge chains like Barnes and Noble. they've always had a book i was looking for, and plenty of gift items for someone on your list.  plus, they are ALWAYS hosting some author or event... i get press releases every other day about another event here. Local and national authors, big and small, from books on sex in your 60s to workshops on how to get your children's book published. they really have a sense of community, bringing people together, holding events that will truly benefit their customers, and 99% of the events are FREE. plus, they're right by Trader Joe's and Wildflower, so it's a fun little pit stop before morning coffee or after a shopping trip.

I enjoy this restaurant every now and then. It's not spectacular, but good and the mix of college crowd and 30-somethings makes for an upbeat atmosphere. the lettuce wraps are a must, and i'm pretty sure most of the sauces are vegan-friendly, so for a "regular" type of restautant, those with restricted foods they can eat should have plenty of options here. there's lots of outside patio seating, which can be fun to people watch on Mill Ave. on a busy night, but i find it can be way too loud with those who like to show off their motorcycles (happens quite a bit on the weekends on this "strip") so be warned. there are also lots of trees, so be wary of getting bombed if you know what i mean. it's happend to me before, so i'ts something to think about if you're here on a first date!

man, i wish this place wasn't all the way in gilbert. it is so beyond good food, i can't explain it.  they've moved from the mesa location after like 20 years or something, and their customers followed.  it's mediterranean style that is best described as a fusion of Greek (lots of kalamata olives, capers, feta, gyro meat), MIddle Eastern (a yogurt sauce similar to tsaziki, pita sandwiches) and italian (pastas, seafood) and it's all served in huge portions.  be warned, the owner/chef will not, under any cirsumstances, take changes or substitutions to any dish. trust me, i worked here, he' snot kidding, and you'll only piss of your server and the owner for pressing for it.  the rest. also includes a coffee bar/fresh dessert bar, and the cakes and tarts and pies are made in house, fresh daily. i recommend the baklava cheescake, to die for. dishes range in price from $6 for a sandwich (pita, and even burgers) to $18 for the pasta dinner dishes. whatever you get it's worth it! they also do wine pairing dinners for like $40 a person.  this place is unique and the food is fantastic.they have a ton of wines and lots of import beers and a full bar. would def make a good date place.

I love this hotel and its accompanying restaurant, Gallo Blanco, so much that I spent my wedding night here.  The small boutique hotel is a Phoenix gem and you won't be disappointed with a stay here, which will be unique and memorable. The lobby is colourful and welcoming, with the restaurant bar just steps away, and several couches to lounge on while you have a drink or to meet friends, and the staff is quick and efficient.  The rooms are good sized and provide all the accommodations you're used to. Ours had a separate sitting room for the TV and sofa, and the bedroom had simply the bed and bathroom. But the real do -not-miss of this hotel is the pool and roof deck (after the restaurant of course!).  After breakfast at GB, we headed straight to the pool and called some friends to join us (I believe the limit is 4 passes, but no one questioned us and we didn't notify anyone about our friends coming). The pool area is gorgeous, with a glass water wall, a brightly tiled and HUGE hot tub and sparkly lights glimmering from the bottom of the pool. Comfy gravity chairs and cushioned "beds" are available (but go fast).  As with any hotel pool, drinks are pricey (there's no outside bar and we constantly came in dripping wet to order at the lobby bar) and we spent a small fortune day drinking at the pool. Our only complaint, which I assume is a one-off, is that we were promised towels all day and none ever materialised.   After dinner at GB (yes, I totally ate there twice in one day), we headed up to the roof top deck to watch the sunset and take in the view of Phoenix city skyline.  It was an absolutely perfect stay and day with our out of town friends loving it, and as a testament to its popularity, I ran into friends in the lobby at both check in and check out.   Notes: Some reviews say this is close to the light rail and other restaurants but I'd say it's set pretty far back from Central Ave (almost a mile) where most of those nicer places and the LR station is. You won't be able to easily walk ESPECIALLY in the summer.  After reading the other reviews this $20 resort fee came back to me. We had received the hotel stay as a wedding gift, so it was a pain to be surprised by the fee not to mention we didn't get any free snacks, no pool towels and certainly not any sunscreen or gift card toward a future stay. How lame!

Just went here for the second time last night, and I really enjoy it. For a tuesday happy hour it had a decent-sized crowd, I haven't been on a weekend yet, but can see how it can get cramped quickly.   however, the front patio and back deck area are supposed to be booze-friendly any day now (they're open, you just can't take your drink out there)  the grilled cheese and tomato soup was awesome and worth $8, which i balked at, at first. i should have known better, because, like the breakfast joint, it may be simple comfort food, but it's made with nice ingredients and is delicious.   the draft beer selection is awesome, but i was in a wine mood, and they had three reds and three white offered by the glass. as a poor kid, i did balk at the lack of happy hour specials. the least expensive wine was $5.5, but a good one.  the house itself is absolutely beautiful and although the design is very hip, they've preserved that tavern charm that makes you want to settle in with a beer and relax with friends.

What a great little delicious cafe tucked away in a strip mall!  I recall when this facility was Sabuddy's and only stopped in every now and then. It switched to Essence some time ago, and I *just* went earlier this month - what is wrong with me? I've been cheating myself out of their killer menu and baked goodies for *how* long?  At the urging of Bonnie, we went for a Saturday morning breakfast trip. I hate to compare, but it's like if Wildflower was more low-key, smaller, with a less "corporate-y" feel, had a more adventurous menu and less suburban snob clientèle, well, this would be it.  I tried the Egg Sandwich on my first trip and thought it was great - putting fried egg on a sandwich is a tough thing to pull off, but it wasn't a runny mess but a tidy, delicious meal. At $4.50, it's one of the cheaper items, but comes with no side and I desperately needed to try the Mashed Potato Cake. But $4 for that thing? I don't know... I wish they just added it to the entree and tacked an extra $1.50 or $2, or just made that side about a dollar less - that seems steep. But it's so good they know they can get away with it!  The coffee (it's from Cartel up the street) was delicious and self serve, as was the ice tea and water. Nice that you don't have to wait at the counter, wait for someone to come by or cut in the front to ask for a refill.  On our next stop I eyed the Quiche Lorraine and Croque Madame. But that Potato Cake was calling my name again and the baguette toast is so good (neither of the two entrees offer it). So I went for an easy standby - the Big Breakfast, which is fried or scrambled eggs, that cake, sauteed mushrooms, toast w/ their homemade jam and one sausage link (from local supplier, Schreiner's). The plate was just gorgeous with those mushrooms and perfectly cooked eggs pre-seasoned with fresh-cracked pepper and everything else. It is a lot of food though - I left almost the entire sausage (nothing wrong, I'm just not a breakfast meats person...unless we're talking chorizo), some mushrooms and half an egg.  On to desserts - I've now (thanks to Bonnie!) had three of their signature macaroons. The Caramel Cream, French Chocolate and the (I think seasonal) Pumpkin Spice. Wow - these are rich and sweet, sweet, sweet. I don't have too much of a sweet tooth, so one bite of one is good enough for me, but at $3 a pop it's worth splurging and saving the rest for later. I also tried their White Chocolate Macadamia Cookie with cranberries (I think that's what it was called, it's not on their online menu). That is definitely more my speed than the uber gooey macs -- it was chewy and a treat without being too sweet and with a tangy-ness added by the cranberries. VERY good.  So wow....just wow! What an amazingly cute, friendly bakery that serves some delicious food. Can't wait to keep coming again and again to try the other items now that I've had my Potato Cake fix for  a while and then to (I haven't even glanced at or began to fathom because the choices are so painstaking as it is) try the lunch menu.

being brand new and in such close proximity to ahwatukee, this place has plenty of barely used merch for cheap.  i've never found any clothes that i was in love with here, though i've tried plenty of stuff on, including wedding dresses (one of which i literally got stuck in - i had to get out of the dressing room to track down my girlfriend to get me out. to top it off, everyone woman over 50 in the store kept asking me when i was getting married...i didn't have the heart to tell them it was for a mail order russian bride halloween costume then a corpse bride costume, so i told them i was fleeing to Nogales with my boyfriend while he was on probabtion). i also tried on a toddler's novelty jacket that had furry sleeves, plastic gorilla chest up front and fuzzy hood. after an obligatory monty burns style "see my vest" dance routine, i moved on to the tapes and electronics section.  some amazing finds 1. a foreigner cassette with Cold as Ice, Feels Like the First Time and Dirty White Boy on it (sadly, it contained a Heart tape inside instead) 2. a weekend-size late 60's orangle floral print suitcase circa the brady's go to hawaii 3. a barely used iron for $3 4. a working boombox WITH a 69 Boys cassette inside (yes, we played it and did the Tootsie Roll in the store)  and many, many knick knacks and fun stuff to entertain ourselves on a sunday.

i realize most of my review is hearsay and conjecture, but i was so impressed i had to share.  1. I tried and heard of Wicked for the first time when a coworker brought them in for a potluck. She also brought in a funny story. She emailed her order ahead, saying she wanted a dozen of the following cupcakes, and proceeded to list the flavors she wanted to make up the dozen. However, when she arrived to pick them up later that week, they read the email as she wanted a dozen EACH of the flavors she listed! She felt terrible and offered to pay for all, but they were cool as could be and understood the miscommunication and let her off with buying only like a third of the order (that's still a lot of damn cupcakes). anyway, due to her misfortune i was able to sample the red velvet (YUM YUM, my favorite), the peanut butter/chocolate and an intense chocolate w/chocolate frosting and chocolate goo in the middle.   ** i am not really a cupcake person, nor a chocolate person, but these were amazing!  2. At the potluck the subject of cupcakes in general came up, in particular how popular they have become. this is news to me, but i guess it's super cool and trendy (esp. in NY) to have a cupcake specialty store. i mentioned that was funny bc my best friend had just decided to have cupcakes instead of  a wedding cake simply because she loves them so much. ... so, in her hunt for the bakery to provide the special cakes for her big day, she tried three or four bakeries that she just hated. she reported: most were owned by barbie blonde "i-married-for-money-but-i-suck-at-designing-handbags-so-ill-open-a-bakery" women who's product, for lack of a better word, sucks. she was blown away with how much they were charging and how gross the cupcakes were! also, they charged her to sample their cakes (odd, when your'e faced with a potentially huge sale, not to mention exposure by doing a wedding).  anyway, she just about lost hope by the time she went to Wicked. i swear these are her words that the owner was the coolest, nicest, most helpful person. some interesting things she noted: for special occassions like weddings, they come and set up their product (the other bakeries would not, you just have to come pick them up and do it yourself - not really something you want to add to your "to do" list on your wedding day, people) and when she questioned whether the frosting would hold up to the late May heat - he assured her that they will have switched to their *summer recipe* for frosting, which is lighter and will not turn to mush before they can be gobbled up.   now that, my friends, is impressive. i need an excuse to buy cupcakes now for myself....

wow, the happy hour here is killer for the gourmet food selection they have. the food is asian-fusion ( i usually hate when restaurants throw "fusion" into any description, it's such an overused trendy word, but i don't mind because it's so good), and during happy hour, their tasty and elegantly served creations are so affordable.  think of it this way, you can either have chicken wings and fried zuchini for happy hour snacks, or, for a few dollar more, have a Kobe beef burger with matchstick fries, seared ahi or tiger prawn spring rolls. it would be a great place to take a new person your dating... familiar foods cooked outside the box that look and taste like their really expensive but are very reasonable.

let me preface my star rating by saying i did not eat here - only a mid workday early hh break. apparently it's the bee's knees for italian food. and it also happens to have quite a reputation for being a bit of cougar bar and the place for the 40+ single set to be seen and take home that recent divorcee and test drive his new maserati/her new boob job.  that being said, i had no desire to try this spot out. however, i was invited here for a HH drink.  when we first showed up, it was about 330, and they didn't technically open til 4, but the bartendar said it was no prob and his smile told me that was sincere. the bar takes up an entire room, a four-sided job and extra tables for more seating. an hour and a half later and this place was buzzing with the right-at-5 HH crowd and cougars were on the prowl indeed - along with business professionals you would expect in TukeTown.   Not sure on the prices of the drinks because i was being treated, but i would imagine they were on the heftier side, given the ambiance and style of the joint. all in all it was a better experience than i was anticipating - the crowd was certainly not my style but i didn't really feel out of place. i'll have to go back for eats and see if it's as fabulous and everyone says!

I think i'm the only person on the planet that not only does not like Bison Witches, but actually has anger toward it.  They always, always, always mess up my order. why? i have no idea. my dining patrons' food always comes out just fine, but mine - either the wrong sandwich entirely, or forgot to add something i asked for, or on my third and final trip that was prefaced with, "OK, I will give them one last chance," there was a hair in it. not just a strand that was probably mine anywa and could have made it's way from a gust and unfortunately on my plate, but baked right into the effing bread! sick.  ok, ok, all that aside... i was also disappointed by all the talk i heard about how cool the Tucson branch is. cause i would never consider this a bar with good sandwiches. it's a sandwich joint and oh yeah, they have beer. you come at lunch time, sure, it's got some customers, but i've never seen this place rockin' on a sat night.  i would compare the sandwich style to dilly's - thick bread slices and they sound like they would be tasty - i just wouldn't know because they can't seem to give me what i would like. so i say unless you're desperate for a drink, just go to dilly's.

well, this is certainly not my style of bar, but it's about 500 feet from my apartment, so  i find myself here a lot. i would prob give it only three stars were not for two things: a bike rack out front - total, unexpected score, and TVs in the bathrooms; excess at its finest. it's definitely trying to cater to the more "distinguished" sports fan, and looks like a more contemporary and i hesitate to say, upscale, bar.  there is NO beer on tap. ket me repeat, NO BEERS ON TAP.  which i don't understand for a sports bar... no pitchers? weird. they do have about six import/nicer beers in a bottle, like bass and heineken, and i believe fat tire is $3 all the time. the long islands are on special for $3 at HH, and are big and tasty.  there is a large, fours-sided bar right in the middle, and lots of tables (both regular height and bar stool height) inside. on the covered patio is a fire pit, pool table and three very large TVs. also inside are two private rooms with their own TVs, couches and tables that can be reserved, i think at no extra charge.  service is spotty, and take it that it's because i'm no where near what the young, pretty things that serve it up here are looking for in an ideal customer, so perhaps i don't really warrant as much attention as that group of guys wooping it up while watching the game.  i agree the food is definitely overpriced for what it is.

This place is unique and has a super cool vibe. the owner is from Cornwall, England, accent and all, and seems like a real nice guy, working the ovens with the rest of the employees. the place is long and thin, and pretty small. if you sit at the bar that looks right into the kitchen, do not sit in front of the oven- every time they open the doors you get a blast of hot air. they used to do $3 Irish Car Bombs all the time, but not sure if they still do. a great little date place if you want someplace unique to share an intimate drink.  the pasties are huge and totally filling, though. so if you plan on doing anything after, be wary of eating the whole thing.

Ok, I'm new to the whole Thai food thing, and I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy food, so take this review for what it is....  I was told by plenty of uber-Thai food fans that this place was the bee's knees, but I wasn't too impressed. i kept it pretty standard ordering just pad thai noodles with tofu and iced tea. the iced tea was killer (i find that at most thai places, what is it with the iced thai tea phenomenon??)  the flavor was pretty bland, i have to say. it was the right amount of spicy, but just still bland, no bueno. plus, for a thai place, they did not cook the tofu well, it was totally bland, too.  i was disappointed, but i will probably go one more time because you never know if you just catch a restaurant on an off day. it was super busy on a tuesday lunch hour, too, but we got in and out pretty quickly, so it's good for a work lunch.  ***update 1/08 I'm glad I made that disclaimer in my original review, because I've been back three times (only for p/u) and it's now one of my top thai places. Maybe I was bitter because my editor took me there for my year review to tell me the paper couldn't afford more than 3 percent raise (on a reporter's salary, that's about 35 cents - you can imagine my bitterness). Hahahaha. I'm still not 100 percent a fan of their tofu, but the other entrees I've tried are not as bland as my OG visit.  It's a great spot to pick up even if I just walk in and order because, what I assume is the owner (a middle-aged Asian women who dresses professional), is SOOO nice and helpful* with the menu and there is a small bar (really small, like 4-5 seats) where I can order a draft and hang out for the 10-15 minutes it takes to make my order.  *definition of "soooo nice and helpful": She answered all our questions regarding level of spiciness and confusion over which entrees included noodles or rice patiently and with a smile; suggested one of the most delicious fried banana/ice cream desserts I've ever had; and, one time she realized we weren't finished with our beers when our tightly packaged food was place on the bar, so she spent five minutes undoing the tie to poke holes in the to-go boxes so the steam could escape and not make our food "sweaty". RIGHT ON!  that definitely earned them an extra star for service! so... more like 3 and half   *************************** i'm bumping up another half star because their stellar customer service is dead-ion consistent every single time i come here. i highly recommend the Yupha's House fried rice with tofu - flavorful and not too greasy. and big points for being able to order every single item on the menu as spicy as you want it.

I have to say Harkins theaters are good about supporting independent film and they saved this theater from being demolished or becoming another trashy dance club on Mill, and got a Tempe Beautification Award (whatever that is) in 2001, probably when Harkins bought it.  to their respect, they didn't try to make it something it's not, they kept the old school marquee out front and show mostly indy films and hold film fests there like Spike and Mike's and the Edge held a free music movie thing there the same weekend as a arts festival, pretty cool. oh, and Arizona filmmakers held their opening of Never Been Thawed here.  if you want to see that indy film that has made it into the mainstream theaters, come here instead and support those that do their part to support independent and local theater.

i really like this little place. the servers and bartenders are always super nice, and the sushi is on the same "signature" rolls you would see at Ra. they also have other stuff like rice dishes and such for non sushi fans, and it's cheap!  they do HH from 4 to 7 and 11 to 1 every day, sweet! oh, and they have a free video jukebox. you get a list of some vids kind of like your sushi card, mark the ones you want to see and give it to the server or Dj and viola! you get to see and hear your song. pretty cool.  inside and outside seating, very hip-ly decorated, def catering to the younger crowd (same as RA).

i recommend this place over other theaters in the area during the week, not the weekend though. during the week it's quiet, relatively new and clean, with nice seats and decent kids behind the popcorn counter. on the weekend, look out! it's the mecca of tweenies and younger teens from the community, and they're all rich and have mom's $40 and nothing to do.

um, is no star an option? this place was so beyond terrible it's humorous. have you ever been to Rocky Point? you know, where they outfit their bars on a shoestring budget of $80, place cheesy plastic beer flags everywhere and have lights that point down at the floor and move jerkily back and forth seemingly in an effort to make you dizzy?  yeah...that's this place. like a time and physical warp to spring break rocky point circa '99 --- ow, ow!!!  not to worry, I'm sure it will be something else in about six months anyway. it was bar/band venue for a second, then it was PA Connection... (wait, why does Tempe need a connection to Pennsylvania??) and now it's the Coconut Club. maybe their trying to channel the success (for lack of a better word) of Margarita Rocks with that name, but it all spells greasy dudes with bad lines and bad music.

Oficially El Dorado park. This park started out as a concrete bank (hence the nickname) that ran under the street, where skaters utlized this happenstance spot and dragged picinic tables to it to make it more fun. that was in the 80s and early 90s.  now, the city took a hint and built an actual skate park...nice idea, in theory, but rumor is they did not engage the knowledge of skaters, and ended up with a mismanaged project that many skaters think is disjointed.  it is free, and part a long, nice park that snakes through Scottsdale and really is very nice. i have lots of good memories of this particular park...before it was a "skatepark" so i enjoy a day here.

Tempe's long awaited and much anticipated skate park landed with a thud, i thought. location sucks, complaints are it's very technical, but it does have a concrete picnic table. the bowl ledges have real coping, so i'm not sure, but would imagine bikes are a no-go. full pads are REQUIRED, helmets, i'm not sure.

this is definitely for the younger skaters who love street. no emphasis on bowls (sorry, old guys with bad knees), tons of ledges.  located in Ahwatukee, so you can imagine it's mostly families and kids, so again, older skaters be wary. compared to the Chandler park in both style and little kids craziness on the weekends factor.  park of a huge, brand new, community center in this affluent area in the very southern tip of the city limits. there's a real nice rog park nearby, a killer community pool (complete with slide!) and is possibly wi-fi capable.... the skatepark has been here for a few years, the other stuff grew up around it, so i imagine it's getting busier and busier everyday. park is free, no pads required.

after i moved out by myself and couldn't afford cable unless it was split three ways, i spent A LOT of time here while living in Tempe.   it's decent for a chain video joint, but, like anywhere else, if it's not a hot new release, they've got about one copy. if you rent it only find out it's scratched or won't play, you're simply SOL. that's happened more than a few times and they didn't offer to have one sent over from another store, and i had to ask for rain check.  and with more popular indy films, they'll have like three or four copies but they're always gone, like always. i've been waiting for Hard Candy for about...six months. i'm pretty sure they just put the box out there for show at this point.  kids that work the counter are friendly enough, and all week long it's filled with college age couples or sorority sisters on the hunt for "the holiday" or some such nonsense ( i have this theory that all sorority girls love cameron diaz).

i really truly respect this place as a legitimate and sanitary body modification place. unlike most places, they don't try to mix tattoos and body piercing in one studio, and i think that adds to a facility's integrity.  they won't pierce you if you smell like alcohol or act intoxicated or are underage. i know plenty of people who've had their holes stretched here, gotten everything you can imagine pierced, or done that implant under the skin thing and have never heard a complaint.  there are ALWAYS peoples inside, but whether they're customers or teenagers just milling around their shop, i don't know.

I used to hate that Einstein's was the only bagel place on campus, cause i loved Bruegger's so much better. I've since grown to enjoy these bagels more. The service here was usually pretty quick (sometimes you only have like 10 minutes between classes) which was nice.   it's nice that it's located on the outer corner of the MU building, as it can get packed in that building, and it it's got it's own entrance and exit.

HA HAHAHAHAHA!  "Pit" is right.... man, this place would have been a terrible idea if i wasn't already expecting lameness. now occupying the space that has seen the death of not one, but two dance club (411 and Level), Peach Pit Afterdark.... I mean Cherry Lounge and Pit is beyond ghetto. opened by the same people who do sugar daddy's and dos gringos, this place has all the sexiness and allure of a Trails commercial. You know? I was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikini-clad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat. well, they've updated the look of the cage-trapped go-go dancers to mini panties with knee-high dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them.  the vids of drunken lounge-goers (a la daddy's and now dos) playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact, interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing "sexy" things like sucking on lollipops, cherries, winking (yes, she was winking right at you, wasn't she? inviting you in to her red-drenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992).  i'm not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line, but the girl in front of me had on an oversized T-shirt, baggy jeans and flip flops (?) and they took her $5 and let her in no problem. i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundy...no joke, spandex black calf leggings, long spandwex shirt in orange, heels and a giant boob belt. it was so incredible i took a picture. she was not impressed with my observation, so i had to sneak the photo.  anyway.... take it for what it is, a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave.

My mom had been trying to take me here for months, but I just never seemed in the mood for Turkish food (whatever that was). But finally, after getting tattooed for two and half hours I was too weak and exhausted to argue (I forgot how draining it is to bear down against pain for so long, whew).  So I show up at the pretty convenient location (on the outer edges of the always busy Trader Joe's/Changing Hands/Walgreens complex) oozing blood out of my shoulder and took the table by the window - suffice to say I was not in the mood for any antics, rude servers or other malarkey. I noticed a raised up area in the corner by the door that had more traditional seating - lower, round tables and a running cushioned booth along the wall, along with lower barrel type seats on the other side - but didn't feel like balancing while I ate since I could barely stand up. When my mom showed up, though, she wanted to move to that area, so we did and I was pleasantly surprised that it was pretty comfy and of sufficient height to not feel awkward.  The server did not aggravate my intolerance in the least. She was authentically Turkish, so much that we had a little trouble understanding her, but she was helpful and patient by way of explaining some of the more unfamiliar dishes (she's prob used to that). Which, by the way, I found were overall similar to entrees and foods that are recognizable if you've ever eaten at Pita Jungle and the like: falafel, hummus, feta, olives, fresh pita, tobouli and stuff that had different names but was similar to spanakopita and yogurt dressing ... all of which were on the Super Sampler, which we ordered to share.  Note: mom is gluten intolerant and could not eat the tobouli here - who knew there was wheat/flour in some tobouli??  Mom sampled a Turkish wine they had on the menu and immediately vetoed it - if you're feeling adventurous and want to get it, get a sample first. They had plenty of other wine and beer on the menu. Not sure about full bar, I was pretty out of it and in no mood for a cocktail. It was a Saturday night, and at about 7, the live entertainment started! A belly dancer complemented the stellar band of traditional instrumentalists. That was sort of tucked into a separate room, so if you're not into it, you can sit far enough away to ignore.  All in all, this place was charming, right down to décor and the authentic servers and entertainment,  and totally unique. That's not a word I ever use, but charming totally sums it up. And, how cool would you look if you took your date here instead of the super trendy Pita Jungle - with free entertainment to boot? Then mosey to Changing Hands to look at books ... perfect date spot indeed.

This is some darn good delivery pizza, in the face of comprable competition like pizza hut or domnioe's. hidden in a tiny strip mall off of lemon and terrace, you can pick up a pie for only $5 on Tuesdays. They actually run a special every weekday, just call and ask what it is -they do require you pick up for the specials though. the best part about this pizza is that you can get flavored crust for no additional charge. like butter and garlic, sesame seed, etc. it's a thinner crust style, similar to dominoe's but much more tasty.

this place is wonderfully dive-esque and right in downtown. not like fun, art walk downtown, but still dead anytime after 5 p.m. downtown.  the Newsroom is within an unsuspecting brick building, that also houses.. im not really sure, but the building is huge, the newsroom is about the size of a one bedroom apartment.  there is two pool tables that i wouldn't bother trying to play on until i came here more than a few times in a row, if you know what i mean. cheap drinks, heavy pour wins my heart every time... but in this case, there was an ace in the hole with their two 1960's era "arcade" games.  one is a bowling game that is set up just like a skeeball, except on a smaller scale - too cool, lebowski would be rpoud. the second, well, i never did figure out what the hell the object of the game was, but it was so old it only took nickels and seemed to be the prototype for pinball.  *i heard this is now closed, sad face.

This is probably the most unique you're going to get in the sprawling affluent suburbia of Ahwatukee.  This little coffee and sandwhich shop is on the corner of 48th and Chandler Blvd, in an unassuming strip mall. the owners are associated with Tilt Gallery in downtown Phx, and they're trying to bring some semblance of an art community to this relatively uninspired culdesac of a village. they often offer live music fridays, open mic night (with actually really good artists) and always have an exhibit on display, usually photography, but not only. they have sandwiches, wraps and of course coffee. if you're in the area, skip the starbuck's that's right across the street and put your money where it does some good - a place that supports local art and artists!

This TJ is right by my work, so it's usually my pit stop for $3 Chuck or flowers for a dinner party or making food at home.   Just last week, I stopped there before my mom's birthday dinner and picked up a small pot of roses, then went right next door to Wine Rack, where i picked up a bottle. i was on my way in less than 20 minutes- sa-weet.

i'm not usually one to patron dos, especially on a crazy day like cinco de mayo, but after relocating to south tempe my options are severely limited on bars i can (or want) to ride my bike to. on a huge DUI enforcement night, bikes were in order and when i found out a brand new dos was opening here i couldn't argue.  it's what you've come to love about this trailer park/rocky point - inspired chain of bar/restaurants. i arrived at about 5 on 5/05 and it the patio was already packed. no cover, and no tables either. big patio and more inside seating at tables than usual. i understand this is supposed to be a more "grown up" dos, more family friendly with a more elaborate menu. it was certainly not family friendly on cinco! ha, i left the craziness at about 7 to watch the fight at a nearby club, and heard from a friend who worked that night that there were more than a few fights - including a girl getting jumped in the bathroom, but that's all heresay and conjecture at this point. good to see grown ups with families still know how to get out of control wasted on holidays and try to kill each other.   but seriously, i can't complain, i was treated very nice by the staff and managers because i had worked with them in the past, and they're more than cool and down to earth. only downside (aside from the basic bro element associated with all dos') is no designated bike locking area, but after seeing how many bikes were there that night, hopefully they'll get a set up.

I finally made it down here for drinks and dinner, and it was fantastic!  I had worked with the owner for a year, as he wrote out monthly wine column, and had always heard good things about this location, and their downtown Chandler sister restuarant, 98 South.  If i had to compare it to anything, it would be Caffe Boa, hands down, by way of atmosphere, food syle and prices.  It's pretty small, located in a strip mall just east of the I-10 on Ray (It's like a mecca of suburban snobbery, with an AJs, a Talbots, etc- this place is on the side that faces east).  They don't serve dinner menu items until 5 p.m., so to pass the time, Mom and i had drinks at the bar, where you could take advantage of HH specials (even run them on saturday, sweet). i hate when restaurants only offer discounts at the bar, p.s. i'm sure there's a very good reason for it, but it's lame.  anyway, i had a glass of fume blanc (it was way too hot for red wine) at half the price and mom had one the best mojitos i have ever tasted. which is saying a lot because i hate rum, and not really into mojitos, but this one was fantastic. we also had their roasted veggies and hummus app for half price. it came with not enough: hummus or veggies - apps are usually shared and there was only one of each kind of veggie; mom and i had to bargain "you get the carrot and i'll take the squash." but the hummus and tsaziki (i have no idea if i'm spelling that right) was excellent.  ok, 5 p.m. arrived and mom and i moved to the only tall dinind area table - i love a tall table. i had the seared scallops and risotta with a side mac and cheese, mom had the fillet that came with bleu cheese and a balsamic dressing. mine was $26, mom's was probably $28.   all in all, it was over a $100 for two meals and five drinks, but the scallops were unbelievable and the steak was everything you would want. mom loved it, and so did i. was the perfect special occasion meal for mother's day!

keep in mind, i'm only rating this pizza in relation to fast food style, delivery pizza - i wouldn't even put them in the same category as Slices or Tesio's.  that being said, when i want greasy food deliverd to my door, i've always been a pizza hut fan - you know, if you're going gross, do it right, don't you think? and for years i lived with girls who were die hard barro's orderers. i didnt really mind because it seemed all the same to me anyway.   but, i just had barro's for the first time in probably a year and a half and that was some good damn pizza. they're ingredients are much better quality, you don't need several napkins to sop up the grease, their crust is better and their consistency kills it (the last tiem i ordered the Hut, i got no cheese, wrong crust and piles of burnt pepporoni -like did a person really take that out of the oven, put it into a box and think someone else would want to eat it?).  so, my faith in better-than-average delivery pizza has been restored, by Barro's. my hang over thanks you.

Hark, what haven is this?! This is THE most well-stocked Circle K I've ever come across in my travels.   There are no gas pumps at this location, but there is just about everything you could need on a pit stop. And by that I mean booze, and lots of it. I'd just about given up on convenience stores having anything besides the most basic of American beers and a six pack of Heineken or Sam Adams, if you're lucky, all jammed into one refrigerator.  Not here. You want wine? They got multiple shelves and bottles that don't stop at Yellow Tale Merlot and Chardonnay. They've even got CHILLED whites that you won't be embarrassed to bring to a dinner party if you're in a pinch.  An extensive liquor selection includes just about anything you could get at a grocery store - Absolute or Smirnoff (in all their flavors), several whiskeys, champagnes (I guess that should have been noted above in my wine section), rums, tequilas; you get the idea. Small bottles, big bottles - and all (including the wines) for an average price, too.   And the service ain't too shabby either. As a friend and I perused the smaller bottles of Smirnoff (for $7.99), the worker was nice enough to mention we could get about twice that for $2 more because it was on sale. Wow....thanks, buddy!  Ok, I didn't get a chance to really inspect the beer selection, but it took up an entire back wall of refrigerated shelves AND there's a "beer cave" for cases.  As we checked out, we mentioned how impressed we were with the selection, and the same worker said they also carry Cristal, Dom and all the other hip-hop video favorites, too (they are currently in the back and need to be asked after, as they experienced a smash and grab two weeks prior).   I'm guessing this all has to do with the store's proximity to Hotel Valley Ho (the booze selection, not the crime), but that's just a guess, and it hardly matters.  Three cheers for Indian School and 64th St Circle K!

I'm also very surprised there are so few reviews for this MAC location. And, like the first reviewer, had Chanel as my artist when I went in for a bridal makeup consultation. (Although I believe there are two Chanels that work at this location. "My" Chanel was tall, with short dark hair and the nicest looking eyebrows I've ever seen).  The appt was booked the week of, and we took the last spot they had left on the day (a Saturday), noon. I later found out that it was the day of the Gaga concert, so not only was it utter mayhem in the store, they might not be so limited on slots with a week's notice. And yes, it requires a minimum of $50 purchase to get the consult. This is achieved VERY quickly, might I add, especially when the artist extols the importance of having the right brushes to do the job (I spent almost $200 on four eye shadows, liner, one brush, foundation, foundation primer and eye make up primer: eeeeeeep!). The verdict: Chanel rocked it. I went in not really knowing what I wanted (I'm a terrible bride, I wish I was one of those women who knows EXACLTY what their wedding dress, hair, look, flowers, etc will be like, it seems so much easier). But Chanel was patient and asked several questions to help me get to a look that would  1. Not melt away at an outdoor wedding in late April 2. Go with my overall look 3. Make me feel comfortable to actually wear; she didn't try to push me outside of my comfort zone 4. Be feasible for me to re-create; she didn't try to push me out of my skill zone either  She also gave tips on how to handle inevitable wedding day tears (hopefully of joy) in a way that won't ruin all your hard work and photos. She wasn't pushy with her creative input and she wasn't pushy with products. She was straight up about what I could get away with out buying, and when I was on the fence about a purchase, she recommended I go home and try it out and if I thought I needed it I could always come back.   There was some annoyance at first as they mixed my appt up with another one, and after being told to wait and watching others come in for their appt after me and still not being seated and started, had to track down someone to figure it out. I had to explain who I was to about three people before it was finally sorted out but they were genuinely apologetic about it and though were clearly overwhelmed with customers and appts didn't get sassy about my issue.  I would also like to note that I never felt like an unwelcome visitor in the land of the make up elite. My artist was patient, even walking through the steps with me several times and making sure I understood before letting me out of there. She even offered to have me call her (at the store) while practicing or day of if I needed reminding of a technique or which color went where. Now that's five star service.

Wow has this place come into its own in the past 4-5 years.  I came here a few times for happy hour when it first opened and enjoyed the atmosphere and the drink specials but wasn't bowled over by the menu.  Funnily enough, it was an episode of Diners, Drive Ins and Dives (I know, I hate that guy too, but it's how I get my American food fix in London) that introduced me to what I would later become obsessed with: that cast iron, wood fired pancake. When it came time to plan my next visit home, I put that shit in my itinerary: Friday, visit grandma and lunch with dad; Saturday, cast iron pancake @St Francis. That's how serious I was about this pancake. Finally, the glorious day came and we arrived at opening time for Saturday brunch (sneaked past the valet who weren't quite set up yet and parked right out front, too!) Settled on the lovely covered patio with it's grape leaves that let just the right amount of sunshine flow through and got to business. Bloody mary ($9 ... ouch), biscuits and gravy ($12) and announced to my friends we'd be splitting the pancake for dessert (I needed my biscuit fix, too!) Fellow diners got the egg sandwich ($10 and one of the cheapest option on the breakfast menu) and the eggs benedict ($13). It took forever for our order to come out. I had to order another bloody mary (considering the price, it was not an easy decision to make), but the air was fine and we had no where to be. Finally, it arrived and was so, so happy. Dreams = fulfilled. The bill came to a whopping £72 (not including tip!) and they could have been a bit more apologetic about the wait and more upfront with updates from the kitchen, but I'll forgive them because PANCAKE.

An absolutely perfect breakfast spot on a lovely day. For a Sunday between 1030 and noon, the wait was zero to ten minutes (pretty impressive for such a prime brunch hour). The grounds are gorgeous and shady, and include an entire farm and green house in which to walk off your meal, and the food was fantastic.   I had the All American Breakfast, which included a perfect sized serving of bacon, two eggs, a biscuit and hash browns. Everything was how you would want it to be - the bacon crisp, the biscuits soft and buttery, the eggs fresh and cooked to order.   My one complaint was the bloody mary, which was WAY too spicy. I'm not one to send a drink back, but it was ruining the meal because it was creating a reaction in my throat with each sip. I flagged down the waitress and asked to add more tomato juice to it to even it out (and she seemed to know what I was going to request before I said, leading me to believe this happens a lot and that they should reconsider their bloody mary mix recipe). But she was more than happy to correct it ... except that they had run out of tomato juice. I left the drink where she placed it back on the table, hoping I wouldn't have to ask to have it removed from the bill.   Smartly, when she came to drop off the check, she asked if we were done and if I wanted the drink. I said no, she then handed us the appropriate ticket. She had the smarts to print one with the drink on it and one without so she would be prepared for either answer, eliminating any awkwardness or time wasting by going back to re-print it. Seriously, it's that kind of simple act of foresight that makes me love a venue's service.  Oh, and they have wi-fi but I couldn't get my phone to pick up the network.

right down the street from good ol' Jupes is O'Kelly's... i only ever go here on thursday, because they do karaoke and it's pretty fun.  also a dive bar, it's large with lots of tables and booths to accomodate a large group of rowdy kids ready to knock the mullet off that guy in a suns jersey sitting at the corner of the bar. YEAH!  drink specials escape me right now, but i know they had them and i was pleased by them... which means it was prob a draft special and i enjoy imports like bass, so they must have other decent beers on tap. pretty cheap, good times.

my editor and i were trying to grab dinner after a long work trip day and on our way to see the cirque love show at the mirage. so, we arrive, a little braindead and with seemingly a few options. a sushi place that looked more like a bar, a nicer italian restuarant with an uninspired menu, or Fin.  i was immediately attracted to the joint for two reasons: i'm a sucker for modernist design and this place looked gorgeous; and because it was completely closed off from the smokey, loud, flashy casino. oh, and the third reason was that there were normal menu items (fried rice, wonton soup) along with more culinarily advernturous stuff (clay pot brisket) for a reasonable price - even for vegas. after being assured by the hostess that we could get in and out in an hour to make our showtime, we entered the soothing, blue/silver somewhat water-inspired decor of Fin. it was quiet, with the sound of flowing water and fresh liliy on the table - just what we needed after a long day. service was excellent. the entire staff was chinese and were the epitome of polite, fast and eager to please. we had a few questions about the dishes and our waiter dutifully steered us toward two dishes he thought we might like - and warned us of the more "different" dishes that take a more adventurous pallete. the foor was damn tasty. i settled on fried rice with dried scallions and egss whites and it was flavorful without being greasy. we also ordered a chicken noodle dish that was pretty standard....no i take that back, "standard" chinese food always tastes too salty to me, and this was not, but i didn't love it. the wonton soup was fantastic, and the egg roll appetizer came out pre-cut into six bite-size pieces, perfect. oh - we also received two complimentary items. after we ordered, they brought out a small serving (a soup spoonful) of pickeled...something. anyway is interesting - clean and vinegary but not overwhelming. also, we were offered a dessert menu, but we declined and they still brought us a nicely presented fortune cookie (i am not a fortune cookie fan, but this was delicious!! buttery and fresh, not rock hard and crumbly) and shot of bailey's cream.   wow. i would def come back for a  nice dinner on the strip with great/fast/polite service and reasonable prices - score.

bonnie told me about this place....oh, about a year and a half ago. i had always meant to try it, but just never got around to it and forgot about it entirely. then, i finally try it and it takes me another three months to right a review.  this place has great tasting, coffee, isn't starbucks, is independently owned and has the most delicious egg, turkey bacon, cheese and avocado breakfast sandwich i've ever tasted (about $5) that came with a nice little side of red grapes. add to that a killer cup of organic, free trade coffee and that's all you really need to say about it.  ok, one more thing: the fact that it's survived right next door to a much larger, much more exposed to the main road bakery should be pretty telling.

they are now a drop-off point for Chef-to-Chef bags. (one of those organizations that you pre-order bags of local farm produce from).

I hadn't been to Switch in years and years, but it's still a reliable and good quality spot in Central Phx, and great location by the light rail and Heard Museum.  The menu manages to be varied and interesting despite having mostly sandwiches and burgers. And God bless em for having pretzel buns. Man, I miss those!  We had spotty service on most recent visit. They had taken the veggie burger off the menu but assured the vegetarian that a veggie patty could replace the meat in any burger. So a burger - with veggie patty - was ordered. And it arrived, with the veggie patty but also with bacon.   The server huffed about taking it back, made n unnecessary  comment along the lines of "Oh, you didn't want bacon? It says it comes with bacon on the menu." True enough but due to your lack of veggie burger option on the menu, the ordering system is sort of flawed.  I am of the position that, as a server who knows the menu inside and out, it would have been helpful to point out to someone ordering a vegetarian version of something on your menu (in the way she was instructed to do it) that their burger choice also comes with bacon and ask if they in fact want the bacon or not. Do I expect too much? Maybe?  In any case, the rest of the food was great, portions big and prices on par for what you get.   I'm still a fan, and I'm glad to see Switch is still going strong in the Central Corridor, as I recall that it was a struggle to get Phoenicians to go out and about in the area back when it opened. It was bustling for a weekday lunch and sounds like it's a popular spot for good quality happy hour cocktails :)

i spent my formative years at this very mall. an orange julius at the food court, shopping for prom dresses at wet seal... ha ha. this mall, and that entire area on southern from dobson to alma school is pretty much abandoned. the only reason anything still exists there is because MCC is right in the area. the mall is floundering, the surrounding restaurants like bennigans and even the pancho's couldn't make it. it's not surprising with super-planned, pre-packaged for the middle class to feel like upper middle class malls like chandler fashionsquare around.

Well, the official name is the Yucca Tap Room (with exactly one beer on tap), but i digress. this is a fun little dive that always has live music on the weekend and there is NEVER a cover.  it can get crowded on the weekends, and it's the kind of dive where the older drunks and local cowboy types still outnumber the tempe college age hipsters. there's shuffle board -YES!- and they do live band karaoke, how effing rock star is that?  a few tables and booths, and a four-sided bar right in the middle. cash only, and with a reputation for being a dive that even my *mother* has heard of this place - now that's classy.

Oh Yucky Tap, I hardly know ye!  Checked out the new expansion last night and I have to say I'm quite impressed. They took over some greasy food joint next door and instead of knocking out a wall and openin' 'er up, they simply added two entrances from the existing Yucca bar you know and love (ahem, some of us know and love quite a bit more than others).  So the first entrance is right off the OG entrance, and the second entrance is punched out of the wood paneling wall where the booths stop on that side. Kinda funny since you won't notice it until someone comes through it, and the glowing white light and shiny floor pulls you in like siren song.   However, the cuteness of the hidden door quickly wears off if you happen to be there on a packed night, because it's placement causes a TON of traffic jams and pushing and shoving as people try to go back/forth from expansion to OG bar, and try to make their way from back/front of OG bar, and people trying to watch the band get sick of shuffling around the disaster. They need a light or a stop sign or something, it was just a mess!  But what about the fucking expansion already, right? No complaints there, not a one. I followed that soft glowing light, past three pool tables, two sparkly new (single person) bathrooms and to the bar, I was lead to a refrigerated cooler of "craft" beers. Beers in there range from $4 - $9. On tap, they had about 8 beers that included SKA True Blonde, Framboise, etc. I got the SKA and it was $4.25  The service was fast and friendly and I was pretty happy to belly up there and wait for my friends. That's when someone sat down next to me and ordered "two slices of pizza, with pineapple and olives." Um, what? You can order FOOD here? You sure can, my dear bar flys. They have a full kitchen that churns out slices, calzones and sandwiches. Whoa! If you were trying to give Taste of Tops a run, you certainly beat them in the food department.   OK, I'm gonna wrap this up since I have a problem with brevity:  Awesome: Custom wall paper with Yucca's signature guitar logo, records and such; local artist paintings for sale and just for looking at; god, those nice new bathrooms need another mention!  Oh! One last thing. A little birdie told me that the craft bar does not factor into the pay out to the bands that play in the OG bar. Something to consider when you come *specifically to see a cool band for no cover.* They make money off a percent of the bar bill (in this case, the OG bar bill only), so keep that in mind.

I had been looking forward to trying Camus' successor for a couple of months, and finally go the chance to on recent Friday night. We had a large group of about 12 or 15, five or so of which arrived about 15 minutes early. So we ordered drinks in the bar area which had some seemingly graffiti-type art that seemed totally out of place in this hip, downtown hotel lounge/restaurant. We mentioned in passing to a waitress that we were here to give someone a head's up and she looked physically sick as she sighed, "Oh, you're the large party? Yeah, I have you." Well, that's not the way to start things off, that's for sure. I totally felt for her - at first. Large groups are very intimidating to serve. Except... the rest of the restaurant was virtually empty. I could go into a laundry list of things she messed up, forgot or simply did not know, but I think J-Man S. already pointed most of them out for us (and that was only our side of the table...) So, on to the food. I was *starving* so I ordered a bowl of $4 miso soup to hold me over until my burger arrived (had I been less starved, I would have ordered the tofu curry or been more adventurous, but all I could think about was grilled animal flesh). Ok, so it took about 40 minutes to get the apps out - seriously? Anyway, I thought RA had, hands down, the worst miso soup, but this place takes the cake. Yeah, it's only 4 bucks, but I was *so* bummed when it finally came out that it was lukewarm and had the consistency of gravy, was flavorless and had not a single vegetable or piece of tofu in it. REALLY?! After an extended conversation with the server about the cheeses offered for the burgers, mine still came out cheese-less...sigh. I had to *send it back* even though I knew it would take anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes for the corrected meal to come out (her average time for fixing her many, many screw ups). Once I finally had my plate, I found that the fries were shockingly still hot - and pretty damn good, too. Too bad the "house fries" that were supposed to be a mix of sweet potato and regular were all regular save for two. The burger was also pretty good...but to give a back-handed compliment, burgers are hard to mess up and at that point, the napkins looked delicious. I did sample Bonnie's tofu curry and thought it was pretty good - the tofu was crispy and the curry sauce seemed flavorful...but I don't trust my opinion at this point because I might have eaten anything. The serving of chicken teriyaki could have fit in a tuna can - sad, sad, sad. On top of that, after an unsatisfying meal, I trekked to the bathroom. I was surprised to find it was filthy and completely out of paper towels and soap. Iiiickkkk. Now that's just unacceptable for a place that charges $12 for a drink. You couldn't pay me to go back to C4 - if they can't even keep the bathrooms clean, I can't imagine what the bar or kitchen looks like.

Lovey love love this boutique. Finally checked it out on a First Friday, of all nights, even though I regularly stop at Roosevelt right next door.  The clothes are incredibly cute but just too expensive for me to justify buying. Not like Urban Outfitters expensive and cute though - at least this stuff is unique and good quality, so if I had an extra $90 lying around, I would totally buy myself a sweater or shirt or that darling pea green corduroy a-line skirt with the swallow patch. I love the dresses, but a hundy on a dress will have to wait til I get a raise (boo salary freeze/recession). However, the jackets were incredibly reasonably priced, around $100-150 and again, very cut. Men's clothes - not totally my taste, a lot of JT style hats and button down shirts ala martini ranch "I'm dressed up!" But, I can afford the jewelry, and oh it is cute, cute, cute. Picked up a five-piece, simple silver toned ring for $6 - yeah, you heard me, $6 - and I get compliments on it all the time. Also picked up a nice little silver feather necklace for the sister for xmas and she loved it. The sis had seen one at U.O. or something for like $29, but I got her the one every girl at HH *won't* have for $18. AND, i can say about the men's selection is that I LOVE the hand-screen-printed (can you hand screen print? Does that makes sense) ties ($30)! In bright jewel tones like peacock blue, hot pink and lime green, with awesome prints like an octopus ... or a bicycle. Bought one for the BF for xmas and gave it to him early so he could wear it at his friend's xmas party and it was a hit! Very unique and incredibly stylish - and I'm a winner cause I'm the cool ass GF that got it for him.  Everybody wins!!! I was going to give four stars, but how cool is shopping before hh at the Roosevelt? I'll tell you - very effin' cool. Another star and BB is outta this world! Ow!

i was tricked into going to this dumpy little wanna-be dos gringos (and if you're aspiring to that be bar...) by some friends who live in the area and said this place had "GREAT breakfast food."  excited to try a new brekkies joint, i came into bongo's and was immediately reminded of Gilligan's. Crap on the walls like surfboards and fake bamboo-ish looking wallpaper... a couple of booths and about ten tall tables with stools (boo - no place to lean back or hang your purse) and one enormous menu. i mean it - that menu is daunting.  here's the thing. how about instead of offering a million crappy entrees, you just pick oh, i don't know, 20 of the favorites and be really good at preparing those. right away, i have to say, i judged the place for trying to cram too much stuff in the kitchen. here's another thing - somehow nothing of the 40 or so breakfast offerings sounded any good. not even a safe bet choice like eggs benedict? oi. on top of the crappy choices, they wanted $9 and up for this shit? and $3.75 for a screwdriver made with orange drink was their special?!  so i went the unsafest bet i could have; the breakfast burrito. i know, i should have known better. country gravy in a burrito? what was i thinking? i panicked at the enormity of the menu i guess. it was nothing worth mentioning...about as salty and greasy as they come.  ah well, not my kind of place, but i can it being a hit with the young 20's Chandler crowd (yeah, i'm assuming their a Chandler bar circuit).

Bogi is totally boss.  There's really no other way to put it. On several recommendations from my fellow yelpers, i took my 2000 Honda in for a 105k mi. "tune up." BTW, i had never, ever replaced a thing in that car (air filters, and brake pads aside).  So i call around and get some quotes. Call 180 first and the receptionist took my info and called me back within a couple hours with the details on what they recommend for my car and how much it would cost. Caught out and about, i asked her to email me the info so i could easily refer to it down the road - she did. Awesome.  Called another top recommended mechanic, Gene's in Tempe. He called back with the quote within 24 hours and was actually slightly cheaper but offered no loaner vehicle or ride and was not open on weekends. No go.  Called Honda dealership - ha!   I repeat. Ha! I had to walk HIM through the recommended replacements I had already found out about thru much more helpful shops. Plus it was about $200 more. Gugh...  Back to Bogi - besides, she's a lady and I love her mission!  Oh, must note: Took the list of recommended replacements and their cost and sent to a few knowledgeable friends. All said Gene and Bogi's quotes were totally legit.  OK, back to Bogi. Took my car promptly at 7:45 as planned and they dropped me off at work since it was just right up the street (p.s. take the loaner, it's a Beamer). They called mid-way thru the day to note a cracked  motor mount they noticed while "in there" and if i wanted to take care of that now (or pay the part cost + $150 labor later). um, i'll do that now. what's another $60 when you're dropping $680, right?  Picked me up promptly at 4:30 and turns out they found another $60 repair needed after already calling and, not wanting to bother me again, just did it -- for free.   Whaaa??  I repeat, Bogi is totally boss.

I actually grew up going to this theater, before it was owned by the strip mall king, mr. Pollack (peep his sweet photo at the theater's web site). It wasn't always a discount theater, but has been since I was in middle school (movies were $1; 50 cents on Tuesday - I keep mistakenly calling this a "dollar theater" to this day).  I hadn't been to the theater in some time, but did recall its incredible arcade selection - Mike Tyson's Punch Out? Yeah! GNR Pinball ? Say what!? Anyway, some of the games have been taken out, apparently to make room for the creepy life-size renditions of movie stars like the Blues Bros. and Johnny Depp's pirate version. I came to know this information when I heard about them playing Can't Buy Me Love (that's right, the 80's movie with a geeky Patrick Dempsey) for FREE on a Wed night. A quick stop at the Vine right down the street for a shot and a beer and we were ready.   We arrived and the service was quick and friendly, the sound was fine, the air conditioning was pumping and we had a great time. I'm returning tonight for a cheap date with the BF. Hooray cheap movies!  Reminders: CASH ONLY - there's an ATM inside at least, but I'm sure it charges an arm and a leg and then some. KIDS EVERYWHERE - when you have five kids, I understand that you can't exactly take them out to the movies very often, or at all - hell, I get pissed spending $10 on a ticket just for myself - and so a discount theater is sure to be a wonderful thing to a parent. But it sucks for me. I would think twice before seeing a kid-oriented movie here, esp. in the summer or on the weekend. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR - Naturally, it's a little messy and the carpet's stained, but come on, you're saving like $7 in ticket fees and another $5-10 in concession prices, so I look the other way when stepping over that spilled 84-ounce soda that no one seems in a hurry to clean up, or the not-so-piping-hot popcorn, or the paper towel ridden bathrooms.

ok. im going to try to be fair to the earl. after all, it's not his fault that my feet hurt in my heels - which apparently got no traction on the highly-polished miracle mile (where this place is located) floors. it's not his fault that i ate shit -HARD- on the concrete floor, landing all knees and wrists and while walking with my boss no less. i concede that.  it's not earl's fault that the miracle miles has the worst layout of all time, and an even worse "you are here" map, which led to even more risk of slipping and falling again as we wandered forever trying to find that wing it was stashed in. we finally found it and for being a sandwich place i was kind of disappointed. there were maybe 8 options (versus a dilly's which is similar in price and order and pick up at counter style). really, all i wanted was a french dip (or meat on a bun with meat juice, as i affectionately refer to it and order when i am starving). but i settled on a tturkey, tomato and brie and their "signature famous" lemonade. the food took kind of while to finally be ready, and by then i was bruised, starving, pouting that they didn't have a simple sandwich staple and pissed that i finally had to *buy* a $16 pair of flip flops because i really feared i would fall again trying to find the damn place. anyway, it was just ok, and about halfway through the most ear-piercing, loudest fucking siren went off right above our heads. the emergency lights started flashing and the sirens broke - briefly - for a robot voice to inform the stunned and deafened consumers that an alarm had been activated and the reason was being investigated. then back to the sirens! really? it was so loud i couldn't concentrate, let alone eat. we tossed the rest and got the eff out of there. all the disaster aside, the food wasn't good, the lemonade was terrible, and the options were pretty bland -slapping brie on every other sandwich doesn't really make it unique or skyrocket your eatery out of subway level, people.

It seems totally unbelievable that, not only did I hang out for more than an hour at a mall, but an outside one at that in 115-degree heat. I attribute my ability to withstand these two unfavorable conditions to two things:  Bonnie  Tea Infusion     It was Bonnie's choice to grab some drinks at what she described as a "great, independently owned tea shop" located at Tempe Marketplace. I'm not a tea connoisseur by any means, and I generally distrust fads (i.e., this silly-sounding thing called "boba" tea), but I agreed cause if  Bonnie likes it, it's gotta be worth checking out, right?    Parking wasn't too much of a hassle on a Sunday afternoon, and we surprisingly got a space close to an entrance to the "District," just outside of Barnes and Noble. Inside, the shop looked much like a Starbucks - and I don't mean to imply that it was uninspired or anything. It was clean, modern and consisted of a long counter behind which two employees busily hand-mixed tea and smoothie concoctions, along with a few tables/chairs.    The menu was extensive and separated into "black," "green" and "white" teas, any of which I could get hot or cold...I think. I picked the tropics white in iced form, and B got my second choice, a peach mix white. Both were pretty delicious. There was also a selection of sandwiches and snacks that I did not sample - next time. I also ran into a good friend there who was delighted by the fact that they had this mystical "boba," and so ordered a Chai-type version with blueberry-sized and -shaped balls floating on the bottom, and an oversized straw to facilitate sucking them up along with the drink. I tried one boba ball and it was gelatinous and chewy - not at all like what I expected - and an odd sensation, but I would totally order one the next time I'm in.    Being in the District and flanked by stores like "Hottie Inc." and Guess, there were several teens inside hanging out in large numbers - boo. So, we decided to sit outside for as long as we could stand it. I was surprised to find that the several shaded tables and misters made for a pretty comfortable environment, and we hung out for a good hour or so before I got so sweaty I have to get mobile.     So, in summary, I would totally come back. Probably before or after a movie, to grab a drink and support an independent store among a mecca of chain retail. Plus, right across the way there is an ASU art gallery (closed Sunday and Monday) that we peeked into and actually cool, interesting sculpture art by local artist and asu instructor David Young.     Touche, the District at Tempe Marketplace - I have to say I am impressed!

that's it - I'm moving back to phoenix. All it took was for three local phoenix boys to open the perfect tavern where I can relax on a massive wooden porch with a pint of bass and wax poetic on the merits of the cure and the clash with a friend after work.  Rose and Crown is a gorgeous home (formerly circa 1900) turned London pub with a warm atmosphere and *killer* music selected on the jukebox. The music I attribute to one of the owners, Chris, who, I eventually discovered, used to play in a mid-90s local punk band called Plinko. I found this tidbit of info out while eavesdropping on a conversation he was having with a couple that was sitting up at the bar. They were chatting about a 1993 punk show in Phx where Circle Jerks and Skankin Pickle played. I excitedly shouted from across the room, "Punk v. Ska?! I was at that show, too!" turns out the owner's band, the couple, and I were ALL at that show, and now ALL sitting a beautiful wood bar relaxing with our English pints (which are 20 OZ across the pond, btw, not 16)  - did I mention I LOVE THIS PLACE?   Deets: It's nestled in Heritage Square - and directly across from Pizzeria Bianco - on a faux street (it was once a street but is now blocked from traffic passing through) with about five other early 19th century homes-turned-restaurant/bar. This really makes for a homey effect. Up a set of stairs and there's plenty of wooden tables and chairs on the enormous front patio (where, I might add, you can actually take your drink to - take that, Roosevelt!). inside is broken up into three rooms off of a foyer. the belly-up portion of the bar itself is kind of small - but there's plenty of high-table seating throughout the two rooms, and a pool table and dart board in the third.  Food - didn't try it, but usual English fare; Shepherd's pie, bangers and mash, fish and chips. Happy hour meant $3.50 import pints (again, these are 20 ouncers) of Bass, Boddington's, Newcastle, Guinness, Stella...you get the idea.  My one major complaint - the parking. There is absolutely no parking near the bar. There are of course plenty of garages nearby - this is right downtown - but on a game night you get screwed. you can try your luck finding a metered space that doesn't require money after 5 p.m. like I did.   But that's not enough to deter me. The owner I mentioned before - who spotted me sitting at the bar alone while I waited for my friend and chatted me up - very much gave the impression that they're just three good friends attempting what every 20-30-somethings dreams about at one point - opening a cool bar. And they did. So go to it.

Ah, what can I say? I fell in love with chez nous the minute I walked in the door (well, maybe five minutes after: I had to wait for my eyes to adjust from the blazing summer sun to the barely lit interior of this retro saloon).  Everything - and I mean everything is just how I remembered: The long bar; the line of cushioned booths along the wall; the wall of rock water feature behind the bar; the only light provided by super dim wall fixtures reminiscent of the late 19th century; the vintage velour wallpaper (now sans the yellowing and 45+ years of old cigarette smoke); the 70s soundtrack- it was all here!   We determined it was slightly smaller than the OG location, but setup almost identically, save for a certainly separate entry room - which, p.s. contained an ATM (this bar is cash only) AND an old school black-and-white photo booth ( a real one, that gives you actual photo-paper print outs).   There was a live band on *Wednesday* night - and they weren't half bad. They won my heart by opening with an instrumental cover of Ms. Jackson (if you're nasty)'s That's The Way Love Goes. Wonderful. Sadly, the special was $3 shots of purple hooter and some other shot I can't recall because i instantly began musing on my other options as soon as I heard "hooter" (it's a weeknight, for chrissakes - what am i? 22?). I believe thurs is 2-for-1 ladies night, too bad we missed that. So, me and the G settled for our mutual love of (well) G&Ts for $4 a pop. I believe draft beers were $3.50, imports $5 and top shelf up to $8.  But we stuck to the G&T, which our barmaid was kind enough to pack a helluva punch in. just three and I was already planning my ipod song list for the ride home (not alarmingly in and of itself, but my chosen songs were a tell-tale sign of drunkenness: lionel Richie/all night long; Britney spears/Gimme More; ToTo/Africa...you get the idea). she was also kind enough to come out to our table when she noticed we were getting low to replenish our liquids.  All in all this place, including its new location, are A+++ in my book.

service - great, fast, nice and consistent. split our check, no prob, knew answers to questions about what goes in their sauces without having to go to the kitchen and ask, and high tailed it when we realized we had to rush out the door to make our show time. also had our table reserved (really, with a sign and everything) and ready to go when we walked in at our reservation time. (take that, wild thaiger)  location - right in the heart of downtown. walking distance to phx symphony hall (which was why we chose it as our pre-show dining spot) and nestled among the businesses so i'm sure is hopping come noon.  ambiance - intimate and on the casual side but with nice touches like dark wood accents. i would have preferred the flat screen in the corner playing news be off, along with the volume (it was dinner time, after all, not a rushed business lunch) and some music instead, but it was only a mild annoyance.  food - i loved my yellow curry. it was sweet and savory and spicy (not hot spicy, but flavorful spicy) and fresh and delicious. portions were huge, and well priced. i wish i could recall the name of the entree my friend got, but it came out with three - yes, three -- chicken breasts! my leftovers were enough for two more meals. a great menu that would fly with kids and less adventurous diners and with thai food appreciators.  misc - hours could be longer. i'm sure it brings in more $$ as a lunch spot, but i would come to dinner more often if they were open later. and they close from like 3 to 5. no full bar - beer and wine only.  overall: very pleased, wish i had come over a year ago when i first heard about it. oh wait, i tried twice and was twice thwarted by their hours!

I've been back many times since I wrote that review, and they continue to get into their groove there and impress. I still find that things are always changing, however.  For example, Bonnie and I went for a weekday hh about 5-6 weeks ago and were told there were food specials (half off apps, i think) but no drink specials -- but there was an "all day everyday day" special on one of their top shelf vodkas (which worked out really well for me.) I come back last night pretty early, around 4, and hh had just started: no food discounts, but half off every drink except their sangria and their "house" drinks like specialty martinis and mojitos, etc. Still a great deal, got another top shelf vodka drink for like $3. Service was still great and friendly, and pizza was still delicious!

i was really impressed with this impossible-to-park-at cafe. i think i committed three moving violations in two minutes trying to find a place to park and being trapped on the southbound side of central (stupid awesome light rail!).   on an aside, anyone else not able to say or think "moving violations" without thinking of that 80s movie with bill murray's much less talented brother? and that song!  anyway, i kind of expected my florist buzz surrounding my florist quality service and options. not at all! all servers were incredibly friendly and helpful - a feat given my dad's refusal to read a menu. it must be told to him, by a beaming, pretty waitress, please.  patio is quite noisy and cramped - btw can't they do something about people locking their bikes to the fence since their handlebars stick into your sitting space and take up even more precious space?? they're prob the servers' bikes ... so work it out!  we happened to go today, on St. Patrick's Day, and they had a special menu of Irish-inspired entrees. dad picked corned beef, mashed potatoes and gravy. i have never, ever tasted corned beef that was good. ever - it's typically stringy and tough. this was delicious, and they won my hard to please dad like whoa.  i chose the cali spinach and added chicken; and that cheese, dressing and almond combo is divine.  and yes, bonnie, not only did my dad enjoy this hipster joint, but that garlic bread is pretty good, too.

I was really looking forward to finally trying out the new Sheraton's new bar. Man, was I disappointed! One - it's just a hotel bar, and it *felt* like a hotel bar. I'm glad I only came for happy hour and not a nice meal because I totally felt like I was just in a hotel. Beer - OK selection (random New Belgium beers I'd never heard of, a Four Peaks beer I'd never heard of - how is that possible? - a Nut Brown Ale, a Lagunitas, a couple Hefeiwizens... all in all it was about 10 beers on hh special) that were only $3 on hh ($3.75) otherwise. That's pretty price. No wines by the glass under $10 or on hh special - bummer. Good sounding food selection on hh - notice I say it sounds good, but it was not good, not at all! We got the sliders ($9) and sweet potato tots ($4). Sliders (2) were dry-meat, bland little things that came with fried onions and some kind of horseradish sauce that was just terrible. Sweet pot tots came out *burned* (really?) and not finely chopped and mashed back together in tot shaped and fried, like regular tots, but simply cut into tot shape and then fried (or, in this case, burned). Which means when you bite into it, it tastes like a grease ball. They came with ranch (again, really?) for dipping, and (now I just sound nit-picky, but this place is supposed to be nice, right?) it was the watery, runny kind of ranch that reminded me of the kind you got in middle school.  My friend got the chicken wrap that actually looked pretty good and she seemed to enjoy it, and a side of fries, which came with ketchup and ...well I don't know the other dip was supposed to be. It was orange, so I hoped it was a chipotle mayo or fancy mustard that would help my tots. But no, it was thick - but congealed like it had been untouched and left out for awhile, and tasted terrible. I really can't place what it was supposed to be or taste like - the seasoning that came on the fries didn't help either. how can you mess up fries?!?! (OK, to solve the mysery, I just looked up the menu and it says "Creamy garlic" was the indiscernible fry dip. Um, what??)  Ok, enough bad stuff, here's what I did like. Root beer (Virgil's) on tap. That's pretty cool. And, my all time favorite part - the prints from Mexican artist Theresa Villegas they had up (though sort of out of sight by the bathrooms). She does these amazing prints inspired by the traditional La Loteria card game (her prints are of the same name). I originally heard of her when she showed at the Mesa Arts Center two years ago and have never talked to anyone who knew about her, let alone seen them anywhere! I thought that was amazing. Also, when the bartender overheard us talking about having ridden the light rail, she informed us that by showing our ticket we got 25 percent off our entire bill! Wow, that's a great deal (I think that only runs through the end of this month, though).

Could not believe how much I loved their carne asada - their sign "Best Carne Asada in Phoenix" wasn't some marketing ploy. I don't know who voted or where this info was published but I don't really care, it was GOOD. Not chewy or rubbery or half burnt - flavorful and delicious.  I got the signature Vampiro Carne Asada taco with melted cheese, guac and carmelized onion. Just one, but could have eaten two for lunch with only minor regrets (my only complaint is that pulverized lettuce heap on top - any more pulsing in the food processor and that would have been lettuce mush). My dining mates got tortas, and raved.  As a Mexican food traditionalist, I balked at the "Our beans do NOT contain lard!" sign, but perhaps some more healthful diners out there (and vegetarians) would appreciate that bit of info. I also ordered an America's Corn - or Mexican Grilled Corn, which is grilled and slathered with mayo (hey, don't knock it til you try it), sprinkled with chili powder and rolled in grated cotija cheese. It was on special that day for $1, but I was immensely unimpressed. Too bad. Maybe I'm just spoiled by Gallo Blanco's version, as that baby'll knock your socks off. As a special treat (it was my bday after all) I picked up a Mexican coke - yummy out of a glass bottle and with cane sugar instead of chemical crap. We enjoyed the picnic-style patio seating (a little loud with 7th St just feets away) but otherwise a nice spot. Will def come back for a HH, which is $2 Mexican beers (Corona, Dos XX, Tecate, Pacifico) and I want to say $1 tacos but don't hold me to that.  I have to admit I am a fool for writing them off for a year due to their uninspired name and Dos Gringos-esque branding and atmosphere. But don't make my mistake; this place was fantastic.

A perfect afternoon and not a thing went wrong. Impressive for our very large group of ladies there as part of a hen do.  We arrived half an hour early but that didn't seem to be a problem for The Howard (really helpful as it's hard to organise 20 women arriving in the right place at the right time). The hotel and tea room is located on a residential street and seems like your arriving at someone's house for tea, not a business. Very intimate and cosy start. Our coats were taken quickly and led to a reception area while final prep was done to the room.  We had a private room, and the server quickly poured the champagne so it was there as we were sitting down. Perfect. He took tea and coffee preferences and their tea of choice was raved about so much that I switched from coffee (also great) to tea and had no regrets.  Extra points for having blue tooth enabled sound system so we could play our music of choice in our room.   Food was excellent, and the scones were warm from the oven. Fresh cream and house made jam was perfect. The sandwiches were also excellent and bread was fresh (no dry corners or other indication they had been made hours or days before and left out). I was not super impressed with the dessert options. They all sounded excellent - lemon tart, eton mess, a scottish-style fudge thing and cheesecake - but I just preferred the sandwiches and scones.   There was plenty of food for everyone and for the price, I was beyond impressed with the quantity and quality. We had a few hours booked, which meant there was plenty of time to sip tea and coffee and play a few party games. We could be as loud as we liked in our private room :)  Yelp check in offered a free glass of prosecco! The server had sense to tell us that instead of us all downloading the app and checking in he would just comp us all a glass. What a good bloke.

£15 bottles of prosecco, super sweet service, lovely decor and a big space with varied seating.  A DJ was setting up when we left (a common thing in Edinburgh I noticed, most spots had a dj, even the restaurants!) but hadn't started when we split around 5:45pm.

Nailed it. For a party of 15 they never missed an order or forgot a cocktail (of which we had many). The prices were unbelievably cheap for the complexity and freshness of the cocktail ingredients.  I had the pulled pork nachos and the Smokey Burger (the one with bbq and an onion ring) and both were delicious. The nachos were so good the entire table kept asking to "try" them again (though were made with fried flour tortilla chips not the traditional, crunchier corn tortilla - this is ok once in a while cause it's tastier but did get soggy more quickly). Service was super friendly and we were checked in on often. Portions were big. We all had a main and prob 4-6 cocktails a piece and paid £24 pp. There was a DJ providing the music, which was inoffensive (by that I mean not obnoxiously overused/generic jams) and didn't impede conversation.  Would totally go back or/and recommend to anyone visiting Edinborough

Sigh ... what Helen C said (we were together at the time). Perhaps a one-off or just bad luck with the waiter, considering everywhere else we went in Edinburgh had top notch service, prices and food, and other reviewers seem to love it. Aside from what Helen already pointed out, we had to remind the server that my order came with juice and coffee, and even then the OJ never showed up. Had subbed out an extra hasbrown for the haggis, when we pointed out that my order had no extra anything (but was missing the haggis and black pudding as requested) he set it down in front of me anyway and rushed off. Came back about 15 mins later with a bowl full of hasbrowns ... like six in the bowl. It felt weirdly passive aggressive. Also it was the only thing that showed up warm.

i originally heard about this lounge from a coworker who must have gone there opening weekend for a birthday get together. her description of the building's history and that crazy amazing plexiglass elevator shaft thing had me intrigued to say the least.  i tried to look up it's web site (none) and even went to az88's site to see if it had a link. nothing. so i checked with my plugged in yelpers and you guys did not fail me! read the reviews and decided i had to check it out.  sho nuff some fellow yelper friends felt the same way and by kismat invited me to join them. based on the reviews and what i had heard, i was expecting industrial steel and exposed brick - not at all. much more soft, loungey and classy than i had pictured. uber dim, with plenty of low, gray couches lined up along the four walls of the massive entry level, which surround a large, four-sided bar. one side of the room appeared to be all tall tables, if that's your thing.   service was pretty good, she was patient with our amorphous group that kept coming and going and disappearing to explore the elevator shaft and the second floor... speaking of the second floor, don't get me started. you'll just have to go and check that out for yourself. but i will tell you that there's another smaller bar up there and lots more booth style seating and a good view of the action below.   for a saturday night this place was incredibly empty. fine with me - i could hear and be served in a timely manner. i don't think that will last for long though - this place has huge potential and is truly unlike any other bar/lounge around.  oh, i should mention that per the yelp reviews i read, i did not try any of the food. it all looked pretty uninspiring, as Erica so aptly noted, and based on what we saw come out and the descriptions we read on the menu, indeed didn't seem worthy of the prices.

When I returned early December for a birthday get together (mine), I was suddenly nervous about having dragged about 15 Tempe residents out to downtown to a place none had been to and most had never heard of, where there is NO parking and drinks are relatively expensive.  But Hanny's didn't make a fool of me. The server - like last time, was charged with serving an amorphous group of fast drinkers who kept wandering off to take pictures, play in the elevator shaft or slide on the tongue couch - excelled. Patient, friendly and informative. In fact, when some drinks erroneously landed on one person's tab - there were several separate checks at our table - she removed them without awkwardness or even so much as an eye roll. Music neither impressed nor (more importantly) annoyed - mostly soul and R&B mixes - and the disappearing/reappearing DJ trick is a good one. I was almost talked into moving the party to the District, where I was told beers were $3 and the atmosphere was something I might enjoy. Glad I didn't (esp. after reading some of the yelp reviews for it!)  Hanny's, I will continue to make the effort to come to your establishment, which is neither close to me or easy to: find/send people to/park around. You're asking a lot, but keep up the good work, work out the kinks and I'll keep making the effort.

I think Kristin sums it up best with "If Roosevelt and Fex had a baby, it would be SideBar."     Chic and trendy décor, small and intimate, playing cult favorites such as Goonies and Edward Scissorhands (on albeit very ill-placed screens), great second-story views, a very post-downtown work crowd... it's all there to be a downtown "hidden gem" that everybody knows about.     I tried their CenPho Tini (I had to hear the name about six times before realizing what was actually being said) - after it was described to me and thought it sounded delicious. Bummer you have to walk around with a martini glass with red-slushie like liquid inside ( I always think people are judging me as a Carrie-wanna-be when I walk around with anything but a martini inside a martini glass...prob because that's exactly what I think when I see it). It was $9, but I still got two!     Beers were $5 for imports, not bad... They do serve some light apps including pita chips and hummus or spinach dip. I know this because when our group sat down at the far couches we were asked to move soon after by (I think) the owner. There was a pre-party set up for some group that would be coming in. Unfortunately, since the group would take up all those white chairs and one couch area, there was really no where else for our group of five to sit (the other couch area was taken and after that it's belly up or small hi-tops with two or three chairs apiece).     We squeezed in at the only other couch set up, and were subjected to annoyed looks by one woman in that party (although there was plenty of room and she clearly overhead the situation). I was annoyed at first, but then begin to enjoy how fraught she was at our intrusion.     OK, on to actual stuff you care about - bathrooms are great, chic and have mints for the taking (boo to the plastic ketchup-style bottle for soap). The hummus was really good and the spinach dip spectacular. Super friendly bartender first time, not too friendly (but helpful and patient) bartender the second time. I will definitely come back, especially to bring new people, as it makes quite a statement as a little hidden away trendy downtown bar.

alright haters, sometimes good things come out of mesa (including yours truly). true, it is a rare and beautiful occurrence when the stars align and "cool" and "mesa" can be used together in the same sentence. this is one of those times: 1. same delicious pasties as you know and love in tempe; 2. except this location has a FULL bar; 3. same $3 irish car bombs you know and love; 4. plus an AMAZING juke box that is FREE (like shady's awesome!); 5. bigger restaurant means even when you belly up, your makeup won't melt off when they open the oven doors; 6. sizable patio that you you can drink on; 7. open late for eating and drinking on the weekends; 8. hooks under the bar to hang your purse on (boys, you may laugh at this, but the floor versus lap dilemma really bums a girl out);   and there you have it: 8.2 reasons to venture to mesa (i mean, it's like barely mesa, right on the border). so suck it up and check it out!

Still lovin the Pasty. Thought it would be worth noting that I brought my British husband here four, yes FOUR, times when he was in town. One of those times we had four more Brits in tow and they all loved it. "It" includes the food, the atmosphere, the beer selection, the giant booth outside that accommodated 8 of us and the great service we recieved. This restaurant manages to be the trifecta of perfect, as it's good for friends, good for low key dates and good for parents too.

Nothing can replace the original Postino's, but this Central Ave. location comes pretty close. Perfect little lunch spot featuring your favorites (i.e. bruschetta planks in all the varieties, yummy paninis and plenty of wine) AND my personal favorite part, the smokin' $5 deal. Just five bucks for a mini pitcher of a draft beer - that's a little over 2 pints' worth of Kiltlifter, Hoegaarden, etc. - or glass of wine = sa-weet. That special runs 7 days a week from 11a-5p. The lunch food items are well priced for what you get, too, with generous portions. Delicious and fresh, for less than $10.  Same great design and atmosphere and killer sliding-door bathroom with a sink big enough to wash your hair in (I'm always a sucker for a cool bathroom!).

I found out about Studio Vino while having a conversation about 30th bday presents for friends with a coworker. Here's how it went.  Coworker: My sister's 30 birthday is coming up and we don't know what to get her. Any ideas?  Me: As a matter of fact, I have a friend with a 30th bday soon and here's what I planned. It's sort of a "welcome to your 30s" tool kit, complete with khaki Capri pants, a belt clip for your cell phone, a pair of crocs and maybe a gift cert for a sensible hair cut that says "I don't need keep up with fashion because I'm 30 now and above all that."  Coworker: Um...yeah.  To dissuade me from my hilarious present, she then sent me a link to Studio Vino, where you can custom label any of the bottles of wine for special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, babies, weddings - whatever. So, you send them a picture of your parents, your sister, etc., come up with a name for your wine and maybe a tagline (I imagine "Just Keeps Getting Better With Age" is pretty popular). Then the owner designs a label using colors you request or she'll do it all on her own. All (including the wine) for like $15! Wow, what a unique gift with a quick turnaround (in my case 24 hours) for less than $20  I made one for my mom for her bday. Since her dog is pretty special to her, I put his picture on the bottle, called the wine "Hair of the Dog" and made it "Draco's Special Reserve." Kari, the owner and the one who designs your labels, came up with a color scheme that complemented the image, and even made the "o" in "Draco" a paw print. Cu-u-u-te. Mom LOVED it and the gift was the hit of the party. Here's how it went down: I sent Kari my desired image and text via email Saturday at about 2p. She sent me three versions within an hour. I picked one and asked her to tweak the colors, she sent me the new version. I OK'd it and had the bottle in hand by 1p the next day.  That being said, custom labeling is not the crux of this business, but is merely a convenient off-shoot of her very cool enterprise. At Studio Vino, you pay about $350 to make and bottle your very own case of wine. So, you choose a grape, spices, flowers, roots - whatever, mix it up, she barrels it at her studio for 75 days (or the allotted time). Then you come back in with up to six of your friends and have a bottling and label-making party - complete with food and music of your choice. You can do a half case for a little less, I believe.   Pretty great, huh? Now go - be a bday hero and give the best present of all time!  p.s. i'm still giving the hilarious welcome to your 30s tool kit present - it will just now also include the "real" present of a kick ass bottle of wine!

Number. One. Fan.  Yep, I said it. I'm their number one freaking fan. Where do I start?   Location and History: inside the historic Clarendon Hotel. If you don't know the story of Don Bolles -- the Arizona Republic reporter who was murdered by the PHX mafia in the hotel's parking lot -- then acquaint yourself on some crazy PHX background. The hotel has some (rather poorly enlarged, unfortunately) newspaper clippings and photos on this throughout its hallways that lead to the bathroom. Anyway, look up the story, then drop some knowledge on your fellow diners -- they will certainly appreciate the space on a whole new level.  Food: Reasonably priced and yum-yum. Tortas, street-style tacos, Mexi brunch, dessert (fresh fruit and crema is light, sweet and perfect end to, say, a giant carna asada burrito), I love it all. I cannot rave enough about their Ejote, or Mexican Grilled Corn. I make everyone I take here try it and have turned them all into addicts. Not to mention, their food is from local farms and much of it is organic...say, what?? For the price, the taste and the guilt-free experience, you simply cannot beat it. I have one note of warning, do NOT get sucked into the curiosity surrounding their Chicharron de Queso (which comes with the quip on their menu: "This is NOT a quesadilla, gringos"). It's basically fried cheese. Sounds so simple and weird that you think Well, it must be more than it sounds, to be on the menu! Nope, it tastes just like the bits of shredded cheese that fall out of your grilled cheese onto the skillet and get half burnt. But everything else I've tried gets a thumbs up.   Live entertainment and extras: Flamenco music and dancing demos every Wednesday = awesome. Held inside the lobby (viewable from most seats in the dining room) or on the roof when it's cooler. Sunday cool baby night -- DJs and hipster mingling on the roof, complete with makeshift bar.  Odds and Ends: The pool area and roof top. Pool area is fantastic with its brightly colored tile, water wall of glass and cacti. Soothing, beautiful and a great spot for out-of-towners to relax. Not to mention the City of Phoenix logo sculpture, which, as Bonnie G pointed out, is a great spot to snag photos with your visiting friends and family. The roof top area is just perfect -- a great view of the city, tons of comfy padded patio furniture.   Between getting to tell newcomers about the cool history, take them up to the roof and introduce them to the Valley's best Ejote, this is my top "hidden gem" in Phoenix. I take my parents here and I take dates here, it's just that versatile and cool.  As such: Number. One. Fan.

For someone who grew up going to Centerpointe (the name of this theater when it was owned by Harkins, before it closed), coming to MADCAP for the first time is a little weird. It's such a shell of its former self.  The escalators are blocked off, so you must stair it up to the second level. The concession and theaters on the first floor are not used, it appears. Perhaps for bigger fest events they're put to use? We came to see Black Dynamite, but it took us several minutes to find the theater where it was playing. There was a random movie in one, a poetry slam in another, and no one - from the concession workers to the ticket worker - could tell us where it was. We eventually found it on our fourth try. A friend got some popcorn and I was floored when he said they didn't have butter for it. Wha? It's just ... dry popcorn? That's been prob sitting there for a few hours? What's the point? I know, it's better for you without the "butter flavoring," but an artery-clogging, movie-going staple! So, all this sounds like I don't care for MADCAP, but that's not true. I love what they're doing, and I'll take a bare bones, butter-free operation to get my fill of cult classics, random indie greats, John Hughes fests, horror fests, b-flicks and more any day. And thank god someone is using that space - there's so much abandoned space and so many empty dirt lots in PHX it's just fucking embarrassing. So kudos, all around to MADCAP - what it stands for, what it offers, and even its skimpy concession.

I heart Loveland. Let me count the ways.  1. Well, the clothes, of course. For example, I was desperate for a new, cute dress for a night out at the museum a few weeks ago, and scoured my brain for options in Tempe: Urban Outfitters - their clothes are simply not well-made or quality enough for the price and rarely fit anyone nicely; Buffalo - yeah, if I'm in the mood for a hunt and peck shopping day where one out of 30 items is worth trying on; Sunset - better than Buffalo but no guarantees. Not only is Loveland on par with Frances and Bunky, two of my downtown faves, they have a bigger, more varying selection: if you loved Zoey Deshanel's wardrobe in 500 Days, there are skirts and blouses right up your alley here; there are also basic summer maxis, structured vintage-style dresses a la mad men, cute, comfy t-shirts, pretty coats,  happy hour appropriate blouses, lounge pants, denim (not a ton, but a bit), fancy party dresses and more. Finally, Tempe got that much cooler.    2. The owners, one of which I met on my first trip in, because they have excellent taste in music (listening to Lykke Li and The Blow instead of Pink makes all the difference during a hot, stuffy, marathon of trying clothes on) and because just one of their buying philosophies is "every dress should have pockets." Hallelujah!   3. Kids' stuff. My BFF just found out her little eggo is preggo, and now I actually peruse this kind of stuff and was delighted with my finds here. What I thought were cute totes that I would actually buy were mini stroller bags. They also had an adorable girl's dress in the cutest 70s pattern and style that, if it were larger, I would wear myself. And the boy's ensembles were cute without being predictable, and all the clothes were soft, soft, soft. I made many, many mental notes for upcoming baby-related events.  4. Jewelry. Unique and either edgy, or pretty, or just fun, for reasonable prices.  5. It's location. Tempe desperately needs more sophisticated bars, restaurants and shopping that appeals to young(ish), urbanites and hip professionals - not just college-age hipsters. Loveland is one of few such options, and I want to shout from a mountain top how important it is to support it!

I will resist the urge to make a joke about the adorable little name, because the staff is just too dang nice and the selection of fabrics too gosh-darn good to say anything bad about the QR. My first trip here was to accompany my mother while she bought a new sewing machine (this is a Bernina store as well). While she played with the machines, I perused the fabrics since I was getting ready to start a beginner's quilting project. First, I would like to give 10 stars for their fabric selection. Jo-Ann's is a joke if you're in need of contemporary colors, prints or a good selection of simple cotton blends. Yes, QR has set-ups of goofy cowboy-themed fabrics draped over an Old West display, and grandma-esque Halloween prints so you can make seasonal throw pillows, but they an equal number of popular (that is, popular outside the quilters' world) prints and colors that fall into the category of modern visual art - perfect prints for projects that you could envision in Urban Outfitter's home department or offered by modcloth.  The fact that they take the time to pre-arrange these fabrics in complementary prints/colors displays to give you ideas and let you see the possibilities is my next favorite thing about QR. My main fault in being crafty is that I am in no way a visionary. It's hard for me to see the potential in one fabric or print or color. It's just incredibly helpful if you're not an art major or design student and just want to have fun. My third favorite part is the staff. These women are passionate about sewing and want you to be excited too. They have worked with every kind of material and done every kind of quilt pattern. Yet, they were patient with a total newbie and walked me through the long process of selecting fabrics for my project. They are quick with tips and advice and opinions, if you want them (and trust me, you want them - learning from your mistakes is expensive and frustrating). They were incredibly supportive when I felt overwhelmed with my project and helped me figure out how to wrap it up and make it look amazing - they were never ageist or craft-snobby toward me at all (not to single you out again Jo-Ann's, but...yeah).  My mother was also very happy with her experience buying a machine from this store, they spent a long time with her, showing her all the new features (a lot has changed since my mom bought her last machine in 1975!) and let her actually use each display model to get a feel for them. They also offer classes on site, and given my interaction so far with the staff, I wouldn't hesitate to sign up for one - these ladies rock!

Most of my excitement and "love" of this place has more to do with what it represents -- not what it is right at this second, but I fully expect that to get better. TFM representing a place in Central Tempe to get basic groceries (all the better that they're local and organic!) without needing access to a car.  When I looked up the location, I felt heartsick at the thought that this is right across the street from where the Co-Op used to be. What's there now? An empty dirt lot. The Co-Op was driven out by an over zealous real estate company that, in the boom of condo building, bought the location, driving Co-Op to another spot where it eventually failed. Know what else failed? That condo endeavor. Now, a few years later, we have this budding marketplace with a lot to live up to. My first trip in, I didn't have anything particular I needed, I just wanted to check things out (though I was making enchiladas later that day, so had a few items I was on the look-out for).  It's pretty small right now, and in the former building of Jake's Shop, which is also another Tempe staple now gone. But it had the basics such as milk, peanut butter, a small selection of produce -- local, of course -- cheese and even some gift-type items for sale in the back.  I picked up some green onions (99 cents for a bunch) and red peppers ($1.29/ea), and thought those prices were exact with a chain grocery. And bread - this is my favorite part of the store! A big selection of sliced wheats and grains, and rolls and longer Ciabatta styles too. And the favorite of my favorite? Fresh "Made this morning!" tortillas! They looked delicious, and were HUGE. The size of a large pizza, they came in flavored varieties for making yummy wraps. When I checked out ($5 minimum for credit card purchases, and a sign said "EBT coming soon"), I was offered another red pepper from a basket by the register because this small batch was about to go bad. So instead of letting them and then throwing them away, they *give* them away with each purchase - wonderful!  Oh, and I was surprised and pleased to see a small corner of the store set up with a couple small tables and a couch, all within view of a large flat screen playing Alice in Wonderland. Sure enough, a kid sat there, out of the way and quiet, while is parents shopped. Both parents and the childless thank the owners for THAT kid haven, I'm sure. I really look forward to coming in again and again and watching this place grow and thrive.  p.s. I highly recommend becoming a fan of their FB page, so you can get daily info about what they just got in, specials, new additions, etc.

This restaurant kicked butt for our group of 12 when we came in for dinner on a Saturday night. Our reservation was for 7p and they were ready for us with a big table toward the back (I definitely recommend sitting as far from the front as possible - the open "windows" to the casino mean you see and hear all the casino noise and smell the cigarettes.)  I think Asian fusion is overrated to begin with, so I didn't find this place any better or worse than a PF Chang's or Bamboo Club, food-wise. The prices were on par with both those chains, and their offerings similar as well. I wasn't starving so shared the Ahi lettuce wraps and fried wontons (with real crab) with a friend. The wontons were excellent, not too greasy with a good balance of cheese and crab inside and wonderful sauce drizzled outside. The Ahi wraps were nothing special, in fact I found the filling to be nearly flavorless. Everyone else at the table was incredibly happy with their entrees - that included the meatloaf sliders, evil jungle princess (yes, she totally ordered it just for the name), and the sizzling salmon and asparagus to name a few. Aesthetically speaking, the sizzling salmon looked absolutely incredible and the perfect serving size.    Serving our large party went off without a hitch, and that is worth three stars alone. There wasn't a single order missed, late, lukewarm or wrong. Though we did have a mysterious order of chicken lettuce wraps show up randomly. I never had to crane my neck to flag someone down for another drink (again, really hard to pull off with a large party), and from the hostess to the server to the manager (who came by to help out and drop off a few items) were cool and genuine. And big points for asking us up front if we all wanted separate checks to avoid awkwardness/confusion at the end of the meal.   They get that fourth star for the really impressive service.   Great job Ling and Louie's!

We came here as a bachelorette party posse, after happy hour-ing in our room at the attached hotel, and having dinner at Ling and Louie's. There was no cover, but I believe we got there right at or just before 10p, which might have been why. I was surprised how packed this place (eventually) got. There was a scant crowd at 10ish. Early in the night my vodka/soda was $5, by last call it was $7 - I don't know if I got an unsolicited upgrade in vodka or if prices went up after a certain time. I'm by no means a club person so take the following criticisms for what that's worth, but this place was totally lifeless and utterly forgettable, by way of vibe, décor and clientele.  The crowd was bizarre - at a casino out on the res, that is to be expected. I surmised they were young folk (mid 20s singles looking to hook up, and edging on 30s married couples in groups who all got a babysitter for the night) who probably lived out in Maricopa and this was the closest club to hit up. (Let's face it, it's the closest anything).  The layout is terrible. There is zilch seating and the dance floor is small. The only seating offered that isn't reserved tables (that require bottle service) is a padded bench in a raised up area. This area, which is also where most of the small, booth like tables are, has no view of the dance floor. Utterly stupid move. It feels like you're totally separated and closed off from the action. The bar is separated right in the middle by this raised up area, so on one side you stand at normal bar, the other side you are a giant, towering over the bartenders and bending oddly to collect your drink. Weird.  The materials, angles and colors of the club made it seem like a cheesy spaceship set.  DJ was ok, basic top 40s stuff with a few old jams from Outkast, MJ and Pharcyde thrown in the mix. But there were more than a handful of times he would put a song and the dance floor would just clear the hell out. But instead of get the hint and cut it early, he would ride it out.  Bartenders were slow and inefficient. In the end, it was convenient and exactly suited our needs for the event: a bachelorette party. But if I had to get dragged out to a club again (yes, I am usually dragged) I would take a PCL or even a Martini Ranch over this place any day.

Came here on a reference from fellow Yelper Taylor F. I called Greg and he quickly gave a run through of the cost and likely source of my problem (an "on" engine light). I needed to fix it quick so I could run my car through emissions and then update my registration. I was told there was a $90 charge for running a diagnostic to find the area where the problem is (this system does not tell what the exact problem is). This $90 was in no way a deposit toward further work (Greg was very clear about that).That seemed sort of steep just to hook my car up to a computer that kind of tells someone where to start looking for an issue, but what the eff do I know about cars? Not much, which was why I avoided dealing with this engine light issue for about ....oh, a year and a half (what?! I have a Honda!)  The business is only open 7-5 M-F, which presents a problem for any person with a job they use their car to get to and work pretty much those exact hours. When I mentioned that, Greg asked how closely I worked to their location and offered a drop off service. Since Taylor gave him such glowing reviews, I decided there was no need to call around for a better diagnostic charge: a $10-20 savings here wasn't much compared to knowing that going forward with any work on the car would be honest and reasonable. So I scheduled an appointment for Monday morning (it was a Friday early afternoon when I called).   Quickly and easily dropped my car off with Greg (who seemingly answers the phone, runs the counter and does the mechanic work??) He was great in person -- just normal and laid back. Never condescneding or sleazy-salesy (as, in my experience,  mechanics are wont to be toward women. Or maybe they're like that to everyone, but in any case, Greg was not). By mid-morning I had an answer: a leaky gas cap. He would order one and replace it same day and even offered to run it to emissions for me all by 3p. It would be $12 for the cap and the normal $27 for the emissions test. Amazing! (Due to the schedule of the person giving me a ride to pick up my car, I had to pick up before he could take it to emissions for me, boo, but good to know, would have been great to skip a trip down there myself.)  Got my car, and it wasn't for another week, when I would gas up again, that I noticed he also fixed a bent latch that made my gas tank door a bitch and a half to open and close. Yay, Greg! Thank you for being an honest and awesome mechanic and putting the ladies who feel awkward/wayward/out of place in this arena at ease. I will happily recommend this place to any friend.

Utterly "meh" experience. Six of us stumbled in on a Sunday morning, having stayed the night at the hotel/casino this café is located in, hungover and in serious need of greasy food.   Well this was the place. There was a short wait at 9 a.m., which was spent in the small waiting area by the glass display case of sweets a la Denny's with elderly and bleary-eyed patrons (though their eyes were glazed over due to marathon slot playing, not marathon drinking, I suspect).   When our table was ready, we rounded the corner (it was nice that this created a dining space entirely closed off from the sound and sights of the casino), past the buffet set up (silver chafer sets heated from beneath, nothing special) and to our table in the middle of the room. Giant screens above our heads were projected upon with sports channels.   And the lights ... those colored lights. What the hell. First of all, it's NINE A.M., no need for a club like atmosphere in a place that clearly wants to be some sort of contemporary greasy spoon. And they abruptly change from red to blue to green, no gradual transition. (Then at one point, the already dim regular  lights went off entirely, leaving the restaurant to be lighted only by these creepy lights, ick).  Our server arrived and she was typical casino employee - short, gruff, no nonsense and I'll say it, rude. (When she finally arrived with our drink orders, a friend mentioned we were ready to order, as in "hey don't run off after you deliver those, we are hungry and you've already taken forever to get waters so let's hurry this along." Her actual response: "you're not doing anything until I set these drinks down." Yikes).  The options were typical diner fare: club sandwiches and burgers (available early), omelettes, mozzarella sticks, garden salads, etc. Though you could get a burger at 9a on a Sunday, you could get nothing stronger than an iced tea - they don't serve booze until 10 a here. Between that and the colored lights, they were not being very kind to my hangover.    I got the chicken fried steak (I know, I think I was still drunk) and it was incredibly un-special. (I've never had it before so have nothing to compare to, but wasn't impressed). I wasn't surprised it was bad, steak in a casino diner is a gamble (yeah!) but how did they manage to mess up breakfast potatoes? They were a mix of undercooked and mushy, and flavorless, were probably not made to order but scooped out of that chafer dish I passed on my way in. It was Denny's quality (and barely made that achievement) but with prices that would be about $2-3 more per entrée than them.    I was not a winner here. Not at all.

Canteen isn't a glowing review type of place. One doesn't gush about Canteen, but one is always grateful for its existence: good food, good happy hour, nice staff. It's no-fuss and easy ... easily found, easy to get to (walkable from Light Rail) straightforward menu. It's all sort of under-the-radar, in a good way.   By way of Mill Ave. offerings, it's my happy hour of choice for food, drinks and atmosphere (I like La Bocca too but this is a bit more lively and bar-like). And kudos for surviving in what should be a prime location when several others could not (which is odd ... how hard is it to follow Duck Soup??)  In any case, here's my pat on the back and "Nice work" for Canteen.

I really try not to give people gifts that I actually want for myself, it's just that my taste in all things is so damn good, I can't help but feel they too will lust after the same things I do. Which is why my husband ended up with a white Holga last Christmas. If you're unfamiliar, it's a toy film camera from China with a cult following among photo nerds due to its completely unpredictable results. The good news is he loved it and it's lots of fun to play with. The bad news is you have to 1. Actually go to a store to buy film (medium format, we usually go with 120); and 2. Actually pay money to process that film   Woo hoo for TCR Photo Imaging, which is conveniently located (at least to me in the East Valley), has reasonable hours and awesome staff. We've taken about 15 rolls of 120 film to them for processing since December (always for a disk, we haven't done prints with them) and not a complaint to speak of. It costs about $4 to process the film and .60 cents per image (they don't charge you for ones that don't come out) to transfer to a disk. I have nothing to compare those prices to, but they seem pretty reasonable to me.   Also, we recently took the Holga in because we couldn't get a loaded film to wind after taking about four photos. Not wanting to break it by forcing the wind or open the back and expose our film, we took it to TCR. They opened it safely, pulled the film out (saving our four photos from exposure) and explained that it's a common problem with a piece of foam separating from the inside and getting caught up in the works. They even offered tips on how to keep it from happening again. That's the kind of knowledge you want from your local photo shop.  The last time we went in, they informed us they were backed up (though catching up) due to the fact that THE ONLY OTHER FILM PROCESSING STORE IN AZ THAT DOES MEDIUM FORMAT CLOSED. Wow, this is the very last place to get your quirky little films developed, how sad. To find the silver lining, I feel lucky that they are close and that they totally rock!

well, i have a special place in my heart (and stomach) for burritos, and this place is like heaven for me.  these GIANT burros comes wrapped in a huge, steamy tortilla, with your choice of black or pinto beans, grilled veggies, rice, chicken (or go all veg) and fixin's like sour cream and pico. it's a long counter ordering/instruction process...like subway.  they conveniently wrap it all in foil so you can eat it with your hands (it takes two).

Wow, I have to write this review immediately, so I can begin the process of purging the memory of this dentist visit forever.  I came here on a referral from a co-worker. I was lazy about researching through the insurance site and he also lives near our office so I knew he had one I could pop over to on a lunch break. His referral was for Dr. Angela Relf. I Googled the number and made the appt. - they were able to see me the same week.   When I pull up to the group of offices, I walked into the wrong one. The guy in there said, "Girls Scouts office is next door." Ha, that's funny. I explained who I was looking for and he said that was on the other side of the building and that it's not Relf there anymore, but a Dr. Jafari. So I get to the right building and Dr. Relf's name is boldly displayed on the window, but "Weldon Dental Care" is on the big sign out front. Whatever, it's a dentist, right?  I'll start with the good stuff, because the bad stuff is really bad.  Good - everyone, from the admin to the tech to the Dr. himself was very nice. And the quickness in getting an appt. that I mentioned before was appreciated.  that's it.  Bad - Wow, ok. First the cleanliness was non-existent. The waiting area seemed fine, but the clientele that came and went as I waited seemed homeless.   I noticed a sign directing to the bathroom, so I figured I'd hit that up before we got started. I had to walk through the work area to get to the bathroom and was surprised at how run down it was back there - dirty floors and scuffs and holes on/in the walls. The bathroom was not very clean wither but I thought I was just being judgmental.  When I came out, a very nice young man said they were ready to start and led me directly to a room with a very old chair and even older equipment. The tech was sweet, but seemed inexperienced, borderline unprofessional. I know those plastic mouth things are always a drag (for X-rays), but I've never gagged when someone was trying to position it! He apologized and gave me time to recover - again, very nice, but yikes.  He did the X-rays, then said it would take about 30 min for them to ready and left the room. I began to look around at the old and rusty faucets, stains on the counters, filthy (FILTHY) floor and plastic trash can with no bag in it.   It seemed weird that they had not started the (teeth) cleaning process. I finally flagged down the same tech and asked if I was also scheduled for a cleaning. He looked at my file and said yes, a polishing was to be done. And he moved me to an equally, if not more dirty room. It was so bad - yellowing equipment, grimey floor, grimey equipment - oh, and I found the missing trash bag from the other can - it was PULLED OVER THE BACK AND HEADREST OF MY CHAIR. They were using in lieu of disposable protective sheets made just for that purpose?!! The longer I waited in there, the more nervous I got. I thought back on the clientele and the new doctor and wondered if this was a free clinic that also took regular patients. I considered leaving, but they'd already done X-rays and I'm sure that's the most expensive part of the dentist visit. Would my insurance let me go somewhere else?   I was texting my co-worker to double check I was in the right place when Dr. Jafari showed up. He was very nice, but seemed unsure about what the next step was. And why was the Dr. doing the cleaning? Isn't that what the tech does? He opened a pack of clean tools and then set them on the table without putting a sheet under them first - what the hell is the point of that? He (without gloves) moved the light and equipment around into the right position (handles on the light had a weird plastic sheet over it, not a disposable full cover you usually see), then put gloves on and touched all the stuff he had touched without them. ugh!  He barely scraped at my teeth (I'm used to them really getting in there and taking care of business, and that's when I used to go regularly - what was this guy doing?) and when the X-rays came back he said I was cavity-free (which is good because I would not have believed anything if they said I need extra work). He seemed knowledgeable to some degree (ex: my gums always bleed when they clean and he went through the possible causes, they were exactly what I'd always heard).  When he was done scraping the tech finished up with the polishing. He changed gloves when he sat down (thank god) and he too seemed to be taking it light on the job. No suction-spray system was used until well into the process. By then I had given up they even possessed such "high-tech" tools and had swallowed a mouthful of that gritty paste and saliva.  OMH - I almost forgot the best part - when he asked if I wanted glasses to protect my eyes/face from the splash-back, he left the room and came back with a pair of SUNGLASSES I had noticed sitting on the counter in the first room. I think they were his. Unbelievable.

I had a chance to read the second (and only other) review for this office that came about a year after mine.  My review probably sounds pretty shocking because the experience WAS shocking. I describe in very accurate detail the specifics of what was dirty and what was handled unprofessionally. I did not exaggerate anything (though I fully admit my use of humor undermines the seriousness of my observations). I'm not complaining that there wasn't bottled water service or TVs, I think that's pretty clear in my review. I'm pointing out that I think (and I'm sure many others would agree) that when you go to an office where people stick their hands and instruments into your mouth, you don't want to look around and see grime on the floors, counters and walls or rust on the sink fixtures. I am not a medical professional, but anyone who has even been to a doctor has seen basic protocol when handling a patient (i.e., watching them open a clean pack of tools, watching them wash their hands in front of you before touching you), and they simply did not follow it here.  The review is not judgmental; it was fair and honest. I pointed out the good (what little there was of it) and the bad. The doctor and all his techs and receptionist were beyond nice and I said as much. But that's hardly the most important thing here.   To this day, I regret not walking out after the x-rays were taken.  I do hope that the office was just in some sort of odd transitional phase and that by the time the other reviewer got there things had changed, I really do. But after what I went through, I'm not willing to give them a second chance. Their lack of professionalism and protocol put me in danger, and that's unacceptable. And not just for me, that's unacceptable for anyone -- the office does pro bono work for the homeless or kids in CPS, that's great, they deserve professional care just as much as I do.

Great service, a variety of comfy seats (sofas, wooden chairs, arm chairs) and a good menu. Great location. Nice, semi-private room with floor to ceiling windows and a view of Edinburgh castle. Bottles of prosecco for £17 ain't bad. Dear god that peppercorn sauce that came with the fries was pure bliss. My only gripe is that the mac n cheese is in fact a pasta bake. Pedantic? Perhaps. But when I order mac and cheese I want creamy sauced mac and cheese goddamit, not pasta with stringy/oily cheese melted on top.

This. This is exactly what I want when I come home. So quintessentially Arizonan. Lovely outdoor space with picnic style seats and loungey sofas. The space is courtyard style so you feel totally encapsulated and are surrounded by desert landscaping, concrete, rust and wood. Part coffee stand, part restaurant, part outdoor lounge.  The sheep's milk ricotta small plate was SO GOOD. Sun dried strawberries? What? Plus our server was nice and gave us an extra basket of that grilled bread.   We also got the fried zucchini, simply because it came with burrata and my sister and I are addicts. Thankfully it was good here (I am ever amazed at the poor quality of burrata out there).  We drank craft beer and sat in the sunshine and ate good food. Man, I miss AZ. Thank you Ocotillo, from the bottom of my heart, for this lovely lunch on my last day in Phoenix.
