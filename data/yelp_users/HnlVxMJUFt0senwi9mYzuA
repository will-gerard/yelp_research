So far so good! The management seems nice for most part, the 1 Bedroom apartments are big and spacious. The price is more than the average price, but the community seems good. Not enough bike racks are evenly spaced in the complex. The Gym is ok with decent equipment, and the swimming pool is 4ft , hey but they have a hot tub :) ! Regarding the locality well, we are glued right in between Castle and Le Girls, can get a bit shady when its dark.

Loved the ambience and was really looking forward to this place, what after having loved lolo's I was really excited about another southern joint?! I havta say I am terribly disappointed with this place, not coming back here for food again  They darn sprinkle bacon on everything, especially when I told the waitress already that I am a vegetarian! Really insulting  The waitress could care less. When asked by one of the elderly women in our party about what is in the soup, she just said she didn't know and didnt even offer to go find out! Why be in service industry if you can't do the only thing you are supposed to do!? Ah well we tipped her $10 anyways, like I said as if she cares even if we didnt, just another day!

Love their salad bar, so much to eat, not as much as sweet tomatoes but good nevertheless! Only suggestion would b if they can get the labels on foods, bcs for people like me who don't eat meat its very difficult to figure out that there's tuna in one of their salads without a label! I almost ate it, so I hope they take this into account! My best is the whole boiled eggs though :)

The best neighborhood liquor store i have ever been too. Yup, the staff is friendly in a liquor store here, not creepy or intimidating like everywhere else!!!.  They have huge collection of beers and wines and other liquors. Whats better, they even let you mix-n-match your 6 pack or 12 pack of beer. They even make suggestions unlike other places. They have some kegs too.   They have these small informative tags and notes on their wine collection with great suggestions.   They also have a decent collection of cigars just in case you were wondering about smoking.    All these reasons require me to become the dutch of this place :)

Not my favorite place, but well no other place in the area is open until 3 during weekdays (not that I know of). The service aint great, the ambiance and setting is poor, the price is expensive for Tempe and the sheeshas that I had weren't anything to go crazy about. and they have this stupid cover charge for more people comin' in ($3). whatever the logic behind that maybe, I would still go to my favorite hookah spots (if they are still open ofc :)). Now that I have drafted this review, it will remind me not to waste money next time at this place at 2:05 AM!

I am not a Coffee guy, neither am I a cafe guy and oh, this aint the Grand Lux cafe! With that cleared up, lets talk about LuX.   It is my most favorite cafe in PHX. and it has nothing to do with the coffee, in fact I never even had a single coffee here, but its for the plain simple fact that they have "The best Bloddy Mary I ever had". That is simply enough to give a 5/5 for this place, but wait it doesnt end there. What about the ambiance of the place and the setting of a cool-retro-urban-sports-new age-vegan style, that should count for more, right? oh and the food, that's something you cant just push around either. Seem to have a lot of vegan food these days? I had eggs with some tomatoes and veg hash, thats right try the veg hash, its just some good ol' hash with the veggies. My buddy had the dutch pancake, interesting. (check the pics).   All said n done, I am going back for some Bloddy mary, in case i forgot, its the best bloddy mary ever. Peace

I wouldnt recommend this place for vegetarians, as they have zilch, excpet for pancakes, toast, omlette and stuff, for which I can go to ihop next door to me. The omelettes for vegetarians doesnt make the cut for me as on top of not having too many options for vegetarians, they charge much for every single topping on it.  The place isnt as big as the name suggests ;) but I love places like that which remind of an old house converted into an eatery. dont get me wrong, but the place is too small, but is super popular in circles, so expect a long wait time, we waited for 30 mins for 2 PM on a Tuesday.  But the price suits well for the Big in the name, the servings arent as big though as the name suggests. I like the build of the place, but I am not going here again.

This is one of the best Mexican food's I have ever eaten, I aint no expert on Mexican food especially since I dont eat no meat, but I do droll over Mexican food and like I told someone who asked me what my most fav food in America was and I said, Mexcian (ironically, get it?). Anyway this place has great food, the alcohol is cheap as well. Get the bucket of coronas. They make their own homemade salsa everyday and oh their beans r excellento! It would have been 5/5 if not for the ambiance, which just to be sure is good, but nothing out of the box. It gives a authentic mexican feel though. The staff are friendly and will make you want to come back for sure again.

I got the eggplant Oscar, it was super pricey just like most of the entrees here. We had a bad waiter, he was very slow to begin with, we had a relatively big group. He had a very bad memory and wouldn't get my drinks until I had to remind him twice. One of my friends ended up getting a live maggot in their food, she realized after eating half of her dish. The waiter came to take it back in and was later joking about how the maggot was still alive. My other friend had his food delayed by 15 mins after we all had ours and eventually when it came out he got the total wrong order. All along from there or he was involved in a sarcastic banter with that friend of ours until he eventually got the order. Then eventually when it came to desserts, they never came out, we had to go pick up our orders after 20 mins. The waiter never got them out as he was busy with the checks, which took forever. There was some issue with the billing machine, so it took forever & then they charged so much for the gratuity , like 20% it was not professional considering how bad te service was( including the maggot in the food) it was shocking they decided to charge us anyways, irrespective of the maggot. Finally when I asked for the Togo Box, the waiter said he will box it for me and took it in and never came out with it, I had to ask him for it again. All in all, super-pricey, bad service, small place, unhygienic, there's nothing to go here for again, until they get better!

Love the food but similar places like oliveo grill are way cheaper and Med fresh are way more tastier! The service is friendly but what gets to me here is the owner/men at counter up front- they aren't friendly at all & don't ever smile or greet you!   And this is really cheap, They have offers on yelp & when i click to use it, the guy at the front says NOO u can't use it! Why have offers and entice customers to come to the place and then say no to them after they are in! Marketing ploy?! Well it's not like I m gonna leave now bcs of that, will I? Hence the stars or STAR!

Very much my kind of a place, it reminded me of the places in Europe/Berlin that I loved so much. Its like a house setting & on the days that we went they had a live band playing great fusion stuff in the back rooms. Their Beer collection is amazing of course, one of the few places in Phoenix with such a huge beer collection.

I had resisted going here many times, but eventually made it the other day & was surprised at how good it was! the combo deals are the best, cheap and way too filling even if u r on empty stomaxh( not sure if it's gotta do anything with the stuff they put in the food, but it's sumptuous,) so an entire plate/entree might b too much! I had spicy pei Wei & it was fab! But try not gettin the tofu here though, it's thin slices & kinda weird, not my style! Havta try chicken & other flavors next time! Fried rice is pretty good

Wheres the 0 star? It's horrible when people like here give you MEAT when you EXCLUSIVELY say you DON'T EAT MEAT! I had to take a bite to realize my burrito had meat in it even after I repeatedly asked them not to! Sadly i realized this at 1:30 AM when i drove back to my place and sat myself down to eat after a longggg day! Atleast I hope they will have the courtesy to gimme what I wanted next time I go there, bcs I feel robbed right now  UPDATE: I went back to return the burrito which they gave me with meat when i clearly specified NO MEAT, they wouldnt give me the burrito I asked for in return!! and they are so RUDE about it, and it doesnt help that they act like they dont understand English at all! One of the worst experiences, I feel CHEATED! Of course I know they cant read this review, its not like they would do anything different even if they did, I dont think they even care about Yelp!

Mayb need to b back for happy hour to see if I can up my rating, but for now this is all!   Ambience - ok  Service - meh Margarita - meh Food - meh Price- ok, but for bad quality they offer it's high  We had a bad waitress, I think her name was naomi, never introduced herself, found it on the check, which was the only time she actually smiled, bcs ofc she needs tips, but for what? She never made me feel welcome, didn't make my day any better, screwed up my order & never spent an extra second with me? In fact towards the end I asked the helper boy for everything and gave him a few $ tip.   I got a cucumber margarita after reading recommendations, which was just meh. Probably would hav been better if frozen. The price doesn't justify it. Macayos or ze tejas has Better ones.  I am a vegetarian, so decided to get veggie fajitas with black beans and corn tortillas. Fajitas were so bland and had no flavor whatsoever. I could stir fry these veggies in my home to taste better. Even a sports bar like Gallaghers has better fajitas than here. Black beans was a disaster, it was just cooked bland beans, no flavor, no salt, nothing at all. Is this supposed to b a joke, or they don't care much about vegetarians? Bcs my gf loves her meat tacos. I am defntly hoping to hear from the owner/manager about this!!   And ofc the corn tortillas never arrived, instead came the flour tortillas, down went my calorie count. Thanks cien agaves, not sure why u r trying to copy tortilla factory? Not coming back soon, unless forced to!!  Check the posted pics along with review

One of my favorite new sports/dive bars! They have great drink specials and specials during games ($3 domestics and $5 Burger?). Their weekend brunch menu is absolutely something to die for. I am a vegetarian and my favorite dish here is ofc the Mac & Cheese, which is out of this world! The staff is friendly and the ambiance is decent. The place aint loud and you can actually have a conversation here. oh and they have pool and shuffleboard. Pool is free during weekends?

I havta say this is one of the better Indian Places I have been to in PHX. I like this place, right after say, the recently opened India Grill and maybe even better than Tandoori Times, Scottsdale.   Sadly, we couldnt sit on the floor seating as it was already occupied by someone else ( need to go back to sit on it). We sat on a table which actually had a real candle, and the lighting is actually romantic (I cant believe I am saying this about an Indian Place in PHX).   I am not sure if people understand the differences between Indian foods, but here is a small primer. This place is an out-n-out North Indian Food place, more specifically they specialize in Punjabi Style food. And don't let anyone else make you believe that there is any other style of Indian food that is tastier and creamier than Punjabi Food and this is hands down the best Punjabi food I have eaten in a while. Oh, I am not biased (since I am from South India). and with that yeah the south Indian cuisine is totally different than North Indian, its like going to a different country and sadly not many restaurants in PHX serve 'real' south Indian food (try Cafe Krishna or woodlands).  and yes what most y'all people eat is infact North Indian food.   Now that we have cleared this outta way, lets talk about Guru Palace. The place is about $$, but it is worth it. We bought the 10 for 20 yelp deal, which helps ofc too. The staff is friendly and attentive. The girl loves samosas, so we got them and they were good. We ordered the complete dinner, and I feel its the best thing to get for the price. I got the vegetarian dinner and she got the tandoori dinner.Check the pictures. It came with tea which was fab and the yummiest Garlic naans I have eaten. The desert was the usual Gulab jamoon which was also one of the best I have eaten (Check Pics). She tells me her dinner was fab as well. It also came with white rice and mine came with 3 curries of my choice. I ordered Malai Kofta, Mutter Panneer and Dal Makkani. She got the okra curry which I swear by was one of the best I have eaten at an Indian place in a long while.   I am definitely coming bak again and hopefully I get to seat on the floor seating and maybe then I give them 6/5 :) Lets celebrate good places like these

I love Old Chicago (OC)! Been a regular at this very location for over 2 + years, plus we come here every sat/Sunday after our weekend game with the entire team and eat food & have great beers! We have seen countless NFL games here & have great stories to share for the times we been here, this OC has been so special to me just for the memories! The food is too good, they hav great beer selections, super good happy hour prices & foods, yummy desserts, great service, awesome ambiennce & to top it all pool.   All this should have prompted me to give 6 out of 5 stars, but the Reason for the low 2 stars is of late they have this new server Jamie. Unfortunately she always gets to be out server and we always feel like she is having a bad day when she comes to our table! She is always  in a hurry, hardly spends time a our table enquiring about us, is rude most often when asked questions about the food & carelessly asks me even to look back at the menu!!! At the same time I see her spending enought time at every other table & smiling! This is really very disturbing behavior and this is a dampener for me since this is the first time anyone at OC has been so rude to me & it spoils my OC experience! Strangely I haven't even done anything to irritate her & can testify it if required!   Such outrageous behavior towards just our group of people raises very many eyebrows! I hope someone looks into it real good and fast before I forever give up on my fav OC! Thank you

I have been to this postinos several times and havent written a review yet. Will try to sum up all my experiences here in one review :p   First off, the place is excellent as the ratings suggest it to be the #2 restaurant on yelp in PHX (behind Postinos Arcadia). The biggest attraction for this place is of course the "$20 for a bruschetta board and any wine bottle" on Mondays and Tuesdays after 8pm. Make sure you get there by 7 atleast on these days, bcs finding a table is like hell here. Negative points for the long wait.  Each Bruschetta board comes with 4 of your choice. Since I am a vegetarian my favs are Ricotta With dates & pistachios, Fresh Mozzarella With tomato & basil, White Bean With chopped tomato, Roasted Peppers With goat cheese, Chopped Tomato With pesto, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese.   In addition I also love the vegetarian panini. Their wine collection is ok as well. Not too many beers on taps but I love the cut-throat pitcher. The staff is friendly for most part, had great experiences on most days I was there, except ofcourse when I encounter sacastic bartenders. Like I always say, you cannot be sarcastic and be a good server in my dictionary, need to know when not to cross the line.   I wll keep going here anyways for the lovely food and since we just got a biggg gift card for ourselevs :)

I have been going here for about 4 years now, only because its the closest bike facility to my house. I use my bike for biking everywhere, but by no means am a hardcore biker, so the only times I have to go to a bike store is pretty much when I have a flat or I get stopped by a random cop for having no headlight.   The place is super-pricey and charge wayyy too much for what they offer. Most of the items in the store too arent for the small-pocketed! If u even dare ask them to have a look at something else, they start talking about service charges. The mechanics dont seem too knowledgeable or atleast dont like answering the questions an average biker has. They are not helpful when it comes to suggestions regarding choosing between several brands of various items.    The people arent way too friendly, there have been times when I just went in and was looking around for upto 10 mins before someone could get to me. I have also observed that the guys who work there ignore other guy customers, when girls are around looking for help.  I always try to ignore this place and dont go here unless its my worst case scenario. As an ASU student, the bike facility on Apache, behind SRC is way too friendly and cheaper too (even though they carry brands that Tempe bicycle does too). I always go there whenever theres a possibility.

Oh I absolutely love this place and I say that as a vegetarian! Well dont think I am crazy. For starters, I just love the ambiance and people here, ah makes me feel like I am in the south! and their portions are HUGE for the price they charge and I heard some meat eaters say the chicken here is way better than KFC :) Anyway, they have a lovely veggie platter in which you can order any 4 side dishes and it comes with their amazing cornbread. I got Collard Greens, Fried Okra, Mac & Cheese and Eggs. Check the pics.  I was tempted to get the beans which would have made my dish completely southern from what I hear, but anyway the food was absolutely amazing. I think my friends got chicken fried steak (?) and catfish and they vouch for them too. oh I have had stupid fries in the past and loved 'em as well. I love how they serve everything in mason jars(?) here! oh and if u get a chance please actually have the chicken and waffles as well! and it was one of our member's birthday that day and the awesome waiter just gave us the amazing Red Velvet cake for free :)

well I am back again and I cant stop not coming to this place! To review, I love the ambiance of this place, the warmth provided by the people here and ofc the food. I got my veggie platter again with the 4 dishes being Fried Okra, Mac & cheese, 2 Eggs/Cheese & Onions and I cant remember what else but I remember feeling amazing bout it :) Oh wait did i eat waffles, ah well I cant remember. I think I should stop eating the sides and eat something else for a change next time, like the salad maybe. ah well to the next time then!

Pros 1. One of the best veggie burgers I have eaten in PHX! They make their own veggie patties everyday apparently! Ah put the fried egg on it, & it will blow Ur mind. Yes u r welcome :) 2. Huge portions for the fries and shakes. We got zucchini tots & sweet potato fries. They were good.  3. The salads look amazing as well, try em  4. The ambience is good and service good, even if a tad slow   Cons 1. No fries are included with the burger and this always gets to me, why should we pay more to get fries, common no burger is complete without the fries!! It's not like the burger is huge to be worth $10. When u order the fries though be careful it's huge, so better to share it with someone.  2. The place is a bit on the expensive side for a burger place  All said I m coming back to get the veggie burger again. Love the places like these that are puttin effort into making the vegetarians happy as well

The 5 stars are bcs I am biased towards coldstone icecream in general. Get the smallest portion always, its always the best when you are not too full :)   I love so many flavours, you can try to mix as many things as you want, dont be scared to mix your own, dont worry no one will judge you, its your ice cream :)

the rating is more like 2.5. oh this isn't a hate review. Read for details   I guess this is family owned, and we went on a thursday afternoon and it was half full according to me for thursday lunch. She got a deal for this place (10 for 20 groupon) and that' why I went there, I generally tend to stay away from Asian Buffets, because  1. they dont have many vegetarian options. 2. They don't really differentiate much between vegetarian and meat, even when it comes to preparation, so don't be surprised if you see an occasional meat piece in your "vegetarian food".  Like i said that is my general observation after being to several of these places. But let's see what's the story at this Thai Buffet   Reason for the 2 stars ( or shud we say Pros)  - Really Friendly people.  Both the old lady (cook?) and the teenage girl (server) were really friendly and tried their best to be personal.  - Amazing desert (coconut sticky Rice?) check the pic - Trying to set up something of a different buffet for a change, I like the concept of a Thai buffet (which for people who don't know is way different from a regular Asian Buffet)  Reason for the LACK of 3 stars ( cons, really)  - No vegetarian options, absolutely NO Options. Oh the rice paper Vietnamese role counts, but does it entail the entire buffet? Thai food has so many lovely vegetarian options, but it was sad to see the place not even try to make a single entree.  - I just feel there was one lady back there preparing everything on her own, so basically when she goes in, she comes back after 20-30 mins with a dish, all along people just wait for it, because the 1-2 dishes out here are empty, what kind of buffet does one havta wait? Eventually people just give up and leave, is this a strategy? Just saying!    - When I asked the old lady about it, she said she will make something but never came out or to me with it until I was done eating, guess she just wanted me to leave lol.  - Finally when I asked again, the old lady came out with egg rolls and she told me the reason they were late was because she had put the 'frozen' egg rolls in the oven too long and a few parts were burnt so she cut them off and brought me the rest. I was like :| (Frozen, really? I could go to costco and buy them myself, whatever happened to making somethin? and really cut the burnt parts and bring me the rest?)  - Oh they didnt even have a drink in the buffet, so basically I had nothing to eat & drink at all.   Anyhow, I would love to come back and check it again in future, if they do make some changes about the cons above, & ofc if they have something veggie other than costco frozen rolls.   But if not anything I just would love to come back and say hi to the wonderful people at Thai Buffet. Like I said, this was never a hate review, I just feel like there is tremendous potential for improvement to a lovely idea.

This is one of my favorite sports pubs. Our team generally goes here straight after practice or after the game almost every week. We have been there at all times possible almost, and the service has been good. The best part about this place is that the happy hour is on everyday and great prices. A lot of appetizers are dirt cheap during hh.   My 3 most favorite or common foods here are   1. boneless wings (toss them in so many different flavors - try the honey hot by itself, or mix it with mustard or the habanero hot if u have balls for spiciness :))   2. Chicken fajitas, they are so good and plentiful. i always substitute chicken with veggies  3. Habanero burger: - its one of the best combinations of a burger i have seen. I of course sub the beef out, but others have told me the reg beef patty is good too.   I love the side of cottage cheese too.   The restrooms are decent and they have pool tables. They have a lot of TVs with lotsa games playing all the time. They also have a jukebox. I have never been here after like midnight, so cant imagine how the scene is there then. looking to reading about that though.

Poor bar service! The bartender had no idea about any drinks! I asked her to make me something good, to surprise me & she did by saying, " she doesn't drink! So she has no idea!!" this is not what I expect from a bartender who expects tips again! Well this one goes against this bar, not going again & they close early anyways

They are pretty good, as long as you are an ASU student or faculty! I won't go anywhere else since I am already paying fee for here as part of my "tuition", stupid but well atleast make use if it! Pretty good for what they offer! Mind-body is pretty cheap as compared to similar courses offered outside elsewhere! They have options for personal trainers too, but not as expensive as outside! The best part about SRC ofc is the heated big pool, huge indoor basketball & outdoor courts, tennis courts, racquetball courts, volleyball/badminton courts, so if you can use all of these facilities it's worth it.  But if you are an outsider you are not allowed from what i remember( please double check that), but you can get secondary membership if you have a roomie who goes to ASU for a decent price.   They are renovating it currently as it is being expanded, the gym facilities even though decent, have room for improvement. Also it gets way too crowded in there during evenings

Place is pretty good, I havent had the food here, but some of the bouncers at the front are nasty, they say, " you gotta hit me with something if you wanna go in", even when they dont have a cover. The rating is exclusively for that.

Someone close lives here. it's pretty decent for a student living around ASU campus. The price ain't too bad either. The management is pretty good & quick to respond to service requests most of the time. Have a good backyard, but they are missing some stuff, like a gym & in-house washers & dryers option! As I said its more than good for its price in this area, you can always come into the office & have a look yourself!   8th st looks shady though at night, less lighting & rocky point cantina very close, but well cops keep an eye most of the time around here, not as shady as Dorsey ofc!  Best point ofc is how close the place is to ASU, four peaks, orbit bus stop & light rail!

Most popular spot on ASU Tempe campus undoubtedly! This is the house of food, entertainment, sports & activities. They have a great selection of food, right from Papa Johns, chic file, subway, BK, extreme pita, taco bell, Einstein bagels, Starbucks! But my fav is the Mexican food place called Z. They have amazing tostada bowl!

I have never given a 5 star rating to an Indian restaurant so far in Arizona and that's saying something already about this place. This place is new and its evident that they are trying extra hard to get brownie points, which isnt necessarily bad ofc and I guess its working :). I just hope it remains this way :) for a while to come.   It is a north Indian food place, atleast as was evident from the dinner buffer we had.   The place is located quite close to the other good Indian place, Kabab palace and is in direct competition with it and I already heard many people say its better than that because food is a tag tastier and a tag cheaper. So finally I decided to go to this place with my gf and friends. We were super-duper hungry and starving, so all of us decided to get the buffets. We went on a wed night.   They had lotsa options in the buffet for both vegetarians and meat lovers. They had veggie pakora as the only appetizer, which was kinda dampening, bcs generally buffets carry more than one appetizer. It's not a biggie since it made me eat all the main entrees for once. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water now.   They were very prompt in bringing garlic nans to the table. and the best or interesting part is they bought sizzling tandoori chicken to the table too (check the pics), they said they do that for dinner buffets. They topped it off with a couple of deserts- gulab jamoon which was meh and rice pudding. They had some fruits and salads, but i conveniently ignored them, as you should at an Indian buffet place.  The first thing that came to my mind when I eat the food was its as delicious as any Indian food that I have ever eaten in AZ. The ambiance of the place is ok, the people seemed nice and prompt and the price was well I will let you decide that, the wed night buffet was $12. When people told me it was cheap, I was expecting cheaper than $12 but I am not complaining (it is cheaper than Kabab palace). I just wish the place remains true as it is now and hope nothing really changes. Maybe one of these days I will go and try a la carte too to get another perspective, but yeah I am already recommending this place and am ready to go again soon.

Stupid place! Zero responsibility towards customers. I had a couples massage scheduled a month in advance for our anniversary, and on the D-day when I finally drive here in rush hour for 30 miles And make it in time here, the manager Trish (?) tells me one of the masseurs cancelled. But I called 3 times before coming here on the same day and noone told me anything about it and she tells me I never called them because if I did, someone would have actually told me that. She said i am lying and was very hostile, while I showed her all the calls I made, times and duration on my phone. Apart from being hostile, careless, and accusing me, she topped it off by saying that "these things happen" & the best she can do right now is to reschedule it!! I was thinking I am not sure how you can undo this and there's no way I am going to be stepping back in here again. I am in the process of canceling my groupon by telling them my horrible experience here.   This place is so busy (bcs of the groupon deal they had, ratings suck though), I had to call in a month in advance to book these dates for our anniversary and what do I get in return in addition to not being able to give my gf her gift for our anniversary, a resechedule in another month? Isn't it the responsibility of the management to make sure someone else covers for a particular masseuers absence? Or is it right to blame, ridicule and accuse the customers for it? What good is the reschedule if I cannot use the service when I need it most ( gift to gf on anniversary)? Plus I had biked 30 miles just because I knew I was getting a massage that day. I went home sore, hurt, scarred, ridiculed and disappointed. It hurts to see people act like this.   She also claims they left me a message, which I never got. And even if at all they did (on someone's number) how come noone told me anything when i called 3 times on the day saying I am coming in, because I fear for such things to happen. On top of that she says I was lying even though I showed her my phone records.   Anyway I was thoroughly shocked when I entered the place, looked like no spa, looked more like a local manicure joint, am glad I didn't have to put my body in their hands ( for whatever way the events turned out). Wish I could give negative ratings

Well for starters I like the fact that finally a decent place has opened up in the big intersection of University and Mill. They are directly competing with Chilli's and P.F.Chang's now! ( Really??). Well the place doesnt seem too busy for now, not like the one in Scottsdale (atleast yet!). Place is very loud. The setting of the place and ambiance seem to be crying oldtown culture out loud, which brings some freshness to mill ave, but only time will tell how the crowd here is going to accept that. oh and I dont remember there being any drink specials or such. I wish I could give 'em 2.5 stars if Yelp allowed me to do so.

It's one of my fav new places! I love comfort food. I know what you are thinkin, why would a vegetarian like me, love comfort food! Well it's the overall package, & it's not like my most fav food, but I like what they do with their okras, hush puppies ( even though it was meant for puppies :p), greens & beans, Mac & cheese, etc. ok enough with the general comfort food, lets talk about P & P.   We went there on a sunday Night, was busy for a sunday night, the place looks interesting inside, looks like a combination of a sports bar and a restaurant but isn't neither. Our waitress was  friendly but a lil' sarcastic maybe? I can't remember her name though ofc. Apparently she can't take it when the customers get indecisive (bcs of the lovely options in the menu) and are not ready to order the food even when she came back like 3 times in 7 mins.   Anyways to the food, my buddy was like woah they have a lot of veggie options for being a pig place. I was hello, remember it has a pickle in it too. :) Oh wait the drinks, aah i posted a pic of their drinks, have a couple of interesting drinks in there. another buddy of mine got a side car, it was meh! I was in mood for something hoppy, so just got myself a left hand IPA. Their beer selection is good as well.   I was contemplating between the vegan burger or the shepards pie. On the waitress's insistence I had to go with the pie. I liked the pie, even though it was bland as it could be. Don't think there was any seasoning in it, but was filling. Had potatoes, lentils, cheese, and stuff in it. I had to add like a bunch of chalula sauce in there to compensate. I am not going to get this again, but I wanna go back to eat the vegan burger, I read that it is bland as well in other reviews, but I will havta try it. oh i am not even gonna try and think what my friends got, ofc all of it had pigs in it, but they did look happy about the food; is what I can muster right now.   Something about this place makes me wanna go again n again. In line with that I wanna go to their HH, or should we say Reverse HH , 10PM onwards everyday. and their desserts will be eaten as well, i hear they are good. Please watch this space for an update then. Until then P & P.

The best bikram yoga studio I have ever been to, and I have been to a few in different states as well. It is relatively new,& so is in perfect condition. You havta come here and experience it yourself. The staff and teachers are excellent and I see quite a few from bikram Phoenix in fact.   The best part is this place isn't really crowded, the studio is relatively big, maybe the word ain't out far about it yet and also maybe since its on dobson in Mesa? Anyway, I wouldn't think of going anywhere else
