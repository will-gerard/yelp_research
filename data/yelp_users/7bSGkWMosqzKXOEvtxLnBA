I love this place. Been coming here sense I was a kid. Jodie is amazeballz and my favorite. It's the only restaurant I'll go to alone just to eat because she makes me feel comfortable and not awkward. The staff here doesn't change very often. Most the same people for years and I love them all. I highly recommend this outback over others.

Service is awful. Lady next to me to go to the bathroom, she was eating alone. They came by and cleared her table. She hadn't even started yet. Then I got the 3 corse meal and they forgot the first one and came out and threw his coworker under the buss. Your my waiter, own the situation. Then it took 20 min to get our check after we were done eating. We had napkins on the plates and everything.

INTERNET IS SLOW - INTERNET IS SLOW - INTERNET IS SLOW  I have updated this review for the the 4th time as my experience went from eh to horrific.When I canceled my lease they gave me a bill for $16,000 and told me I only have 15 days to pay. Then a month later they gave me a bill for $5000 and sent straight to collections because I didn't pay the first bill in 15 days. lied about a payment plan and I feel very cheated by them. I got someone to move into my place very rapidly. Also, I ended my lease due to internet speed, broken amenities and it wasnt an easy process. Its really not a bad place but for the price and the simple fact my sales person over promised the internet, its not worth it to me. The internet speeds truly are awful, I told her it was the MOST important thing when I moved in and she straight up lied to me. She really was the nicest person ever, ignorance is lying when you sell contracts in my book. Mostly frustrated because you can't even pay for more speed if you want to you also can't stop paying either, you're forced to pay for it. They work with this really sucky company called Pavlov Media, who in all fairness is the steam of most my frustration, and the two play the blame game all the time. You are forced to pay $100 every month for internet you can only connect 5 things to and Direct Tv. Then you have to pay $200 just to turn the TV on so that you can watch the USED  box the last guy left in your apartment, mine still had the last guys programing on it.   The office staff is friendly and I only had one experience that have made me feel pretty unwelcome the first time I complained about Pavlov. Their website really needs an update. Everything is clean in the common areas. The common areas LOOK very nice but no one actually uses them, its missing something that draws people in to actually use them. I'm sure its great for studying. People use the pool areas but the BBQ is ALWAYS broken sense I moved in, I have read reviews on here going really far back about the BBQ. My bathtub is corroding away too, known issue I am working with them on. They also promised community events every Monday when I moved in, its now 2/3  a month. I was thinking like actually fun events like Mark Taylor style pool bash but its more like "movie at the pool" and "Heres some food now leave" style activities not targeted to the age group that lives here but more like events you would see at Lifetime Fitness. I like free food but it would be fun to meet other people. Another small detail but it was a selling point to me because I just moved back to the city, young and not a student so thought it would be a cool place to meet people or invite friends over to enjoy with me. Grigio is BIG sorta has identity issues and they can't seem to balance if they want to be a hip fun luxury college and grad student pad or a boring residential community, makes sense though because the hip college aged students from a few years ago haven't moved so I bet this place has a crazy mixed demographic. I pay $1000 a month for my studio and dog and id say I feel like its only about $200 over priced a month, if it was closer to $850 I think it would be on spot as far as value goes. They have a lot of competition now and I feel like an idiot I didn't shop around more. I may be over critical but Grigio has been my castle on the hill sense it was built and I was still in Jr High I really wanted to live their someday and now I am here. I'm really not exaggerating that its been on the goal list for about 8 years and now I am here.  My photography business has taken a hit because of the internet speeds here, impossible to do actual business from home on. Its not that its always bad its just when it acts up its REALLY BAD. They did own up to the mistakes, and I'm sorry I can't stay but I appreciate them working with me on this.  Pros: Very Clean - Awesome Gym - VERY nice member services staff, Great Location (except you are kind of on an island from grocery and gas stations) - neighbors are genuinely friendly - pet friendly but mostly small dogs. Friendly staff, FREE COFFEE AREA.   Cons: Just a little over priced for what it is but I am sure location has a lot to do with it. Very general community events geared to hit a very wide range of ages unlike most the similar properties in the area that are geared to the younger crowed. Very loud at night when people come home on the weekend. The main entrance closes at night. Pavlov Media is awful.

INTERNET IS SLOW - INTERNET IS SLOW - INTERNET IS SLOW  I have updated this review for the the 4th time as my experience was a roller coaster. I ended my lease due to internet speed, babas always broken and it was a horrific process. Gave me a bill for $16,000 to move out, 3 different people told me 3 different things. Told me I had 15 days to pay it. Then in 30 days gave me a new bill for $5,000 but sent it straight to collections because I didn't pay the first bill in 15 days. I actually changed my review from positive to negative because I feel VERY cheated. They got someone to move in my place very quickly. Lied to me about a payment plan, then told me I could work that out with collections. For the price and the simple fact my sales person over promised the internet, its not worth it to me. The internet speeds truly are awful, I told her it was the MOST important thing when I moved in and she straight up lied to me. She really was the nicest person ever, ignorance is lying when you sell contracts in my book.

Then you have to pay $200 just to turn the TV on so that you can watch the USED  box the last guy left in your apartment, mine still had the last guys programing on it.   The office staff is friendly, but not knowledgeable on there own policies and I only had one experience that have made me feel pretty unwelcome the first time I complained about Pavlov. Their website really needs an update. Everything is clean in the common areas.
