DO  NOT GO HERE! Coming from a family of public safety and my boyfriend and I being fire/ems I am thoroughly upset with the "safety and service"and scared to step foot in this place ever again just because of that. A nice date day turned horrible! We just left here and I'm glad I did!!! Since my boyfriend is too pissed to write this right now I will tell our account.   All was well until three reckless guys came to the lane next to us CONSTANTLY being warned not to rapid fire roughhouse ect. THEN I caught THREE ricochets in the damn leg and boob Two seperate times!! Careless staff and they let anyone in. No official range officer I could see in the area until after i reported the recklessnessand after showing the shrap metal I pulled out of my shin, knee and bra and the fact that it broke the skin and drew blood we still had to be the ones to leave out of concern for safety.  If I can make one point its this:   Staff really needs to be better trained on NFA AND ATF stipulations since they didn't catch things and allowed certain weapons of a certain manner to be shot next to us.   Heading home to clean up my leg, ice, and elevate!

Immaculate/immediate service!  The guys here are great! Especially the service department! I schedule my appointment online and Aaron Branch in service takes care of me!  Specifically HIS service is what keeps me returning to this place. He is friendly, knowledgeable and an honest trustworthy guy who investigates every customers needs for their vehicle and not just a generic schedule to give you a great deal. Not to mention, if you wait here for service the area is warm and inviting with plenty of comfy cozy furniture and it looks like the inside of cabelas or bass pro shops with all of the "nature". This dealer does it right. Go here. Period. You won't be disappoinred.

This place is such a hidden gem!  Prices are reasonable and its clean and professional. You can walk in and truly feel that all the stylists get along and make you feel welcomed. I've followed Pat Austin over from a previous salon thats how much I love this stylist! She saved my hair after another salon fried it and still made it look a natural color! She used to be a salon owner and has years of experience so you know you're getting your moneys worh! Go see Pat! Just do it...she does everyrhing!...you're welcome in advance!
