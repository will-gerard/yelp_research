O'Connor's is a great little Irish pub where their motto "Where you're a stranger only once" is so true.  I was introduced to this pub about two years ago by my sister and haven't left.  This is my home away from home.  I truly fell in love with the atmosphere, the people I meet, the bartenders and management, the great bands and the little history lessons of Ireland that I receive once in a while.  You will definitely have a great time when you stop in during Happy Hour any day of the week or even during late at night to hear the great music on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.  O'Connor's is a place that I definitely recommend to all my friends ever chance i get. Stop on in and enjoy some good craic (which means news, gossip, fun, entertainment, and enjoyable conversation, particularly prominent in Ireland).  Slainte!!!

Greektown is hands down a great little restaurant to go to for a quick meal or a long sitdown meal.  Food is amazing and delicious.  I especially recommend the Escargot and Calamari. Also George, the owner, always is a ball of energy when i see him. He greets you with a smile and always has little stories and jokes to tell you. I definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends whenever i can.

I was introduced to this pub last night (Thursday) when I went there to see a friend of mine play and wasn't impressed.  the pub's atmosphere seemed very uncomfortable for me; didn't get a great vibe from it. Overall, the pub looks very nice with all the wood floors and a very warm, traditional style of an Irish pub. I will say that the bartender was very nice and friendly; however, didn't really know who the waiters/waitresses were so didn't know how to ask for drinks or food when I did eventually sit down. I will also say that if any of my girlfriends go to this pub, I will definitely recommend that they go with friends or at least one other person (guy or girl). I was hit on barely 10 minutes after entering the pub and the guy would not leave me alone nor take no for an answer. my friend playing eventually had to stop in the middle of his song/set to tell the guy to leave me alone. The guy was eventually removed from the premise and I was able to enjoy the rest of the night. Overall, my experience at this pub was not the greatest and will probably not be going back anytime soon.

I was introduced to this pub when my sister decided to have a Happy Hour/Team Trivia night. It was a Wednesday night and all of us had a blast. The overall atmosphere of the pub was very welcoming. The bartenders were very helpful with deciding what drink would satisfy your mood. They had a very good selection of beers and other drinks. The food was also phenomenal. When the trivia game began around 7pm, the announcer was very funny and engaging with the audience. Overall, i rate this pub very enjoyable and will definitely recommend it to friends.
