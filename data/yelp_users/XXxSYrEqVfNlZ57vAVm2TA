First come, first serve can mean a lot of things. Here it can mean you get passed over and all you can do is sit by and watch the ppl who checked in after you get a therapist like they tipped the receptionist. Take their estimate of a wait time with a grain of salt. I was told 20-30 minutes which actually turned into 3 1/2 hours.  One tip....find out how many students are working & ask how many are in front of you. Do your own estimate. Too bad they don't do it like the DMV with number tickets and a countdown screen.  I get a massage every week because I have a slipped disc in my back. Sitting for 3 & a half hours was agony. I know what you're thinking why didn't I just leave? Well I only had one more walk in me... to the car out in the parking lot in the hot sun, or wait it out. I do know one thing if I go back I'm taking my yoga pad and laying down in the lobby. I can't do that kind of sitting again.  There is one Saving Grace. Her name is Victoria, and she was my therapist that day. She was one week away from graduating and I can tell you after having massages for the past 8 years. She is in my top 3. The school is turning out some knowledgeable and qualified therapists and they can make your week a whole lot better Too bad the process of getting a session is like getting a tooth pulled ,

Affordable and tasty all in one place. I love their beans so I always get a bean tostada. I love their $3 menu too so I have to choose from that too. I'm a fan!

I got a code from a driver to get some free ride credit with a new company in Phoenix called Fare. I liked it a lot better since I got the full $25 to use on 3 rides. I was also able to schedule my ride in advance with the driver I wanted. I don't think I'll use Uber again, sorry. Bonus alert: my driver and I both had the same name! kewl! Debbie1
