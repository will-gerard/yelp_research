Convenient and delicious. Slightly higher price than other 'drive-thrus' but the portion size is relative. Even at the drive through I wait a little while, but honestly- it's worth it - which says alot!  I will definitely keep going back.

Delicious!!! Swordfish, scallops, shrimp.. Oh my. Definitely authentic Italian menu. We also tried the grilled calamari.. And had marzipan and butter cookies for dessert. Top notch. I can't wait to go back and have their spaghetti.

First, let me start of by saying the Hyatt Regency Gainey is gorgeous!  It was kind of confusing how to find the restaurant. There weren't any signs that I noticed. Dinner was delicious. I had the seared tuna perfectly cooked and my date had chicken with a tasty sweet glaze on it.   I think the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it wasn't really as romantic of an atmosphere as I expected. I think it was the location of where we were sitting and possibly the fact that it is a hotel and there were families with shrieking kids near us.  However, the service and staff were friendly and when I booked the reservation I made a note that the gondola ride was a surprise so the complimentary passes were sneaked to me by the waiter - AWESOME! It was very appreciated.  Then we went to find the Gondola's and that was confusing too. We walked around awhile until we figured it out, but that's ok because the resort is so pretty!  Overall, a new and different experience that you wouldn't think you would get to experience in the Valley and a must-do for a sweet/cute date night.

I went here on a first date. It was a great atmosphere for that type of situation.  We were seated outside on the patio and it was illuminated by twinkling lights. Very pretty! Our table wasn't the best, kind of crammed up against the wall but I think they had to do some rearranging due to some rain showers that kept popping up.  I ordered steak tacos and my date ordered an entr√©e with steak as well. Perfectly cooked and very good flavor.  Overall it was a great dining experience. I didn't pay, but I do know it was very pricey. The portion sizes were about just right. I'd definitely recommend to others that are looking for an intimate atmosphere that's romantic and has good food.

Avoid them. Overall the company is disorganized. It's hard to get an appointment or an estimate out of these people - especially Morris (who is the owner) Not good when the owner is the worst person to deal with. The only reason I went forward with the company after reading previous reviews is because Morris was not my primary worker. They contract people out so they up their prices and I had a problem with the electrical work they did in my home. Apparently, the workers take on more than they know how to do. I would rather just see this company out of business.  Goodluck if you decide to work with them.

Friendly people at the desk, Clean, and calm atmosphere like you would hope. Really a beautiful and tranquil room that they have set up. The reflexology massage was head to toe awesomeness. I am definitely going back.

The slices are huge! Delicious pizza and friendly people working there. This was not my first time, but wanted to share a good review- last time I went in they apologized because i would have a longer wait, they had to remake my pizza... They were kind about it, offered me a free fountain drink while I waited and offered a 2 liter again once the pizza was ready. Nice gesture. Their prices are reasonable for the size of the slice. They also offer lots of premium topping choices that other pizza places don't offer.

AMAZING! We went for breakfast and 5 of us at the table - some selected the french toast which had very fresh berries, others chose an omelete, and I chose the breakfast burrito. The burrito was the talk of the table, lucky me. I thought everything was delicious and have already suggested Sevens' to others.

Sadly, we didn't even get to taste their food. Our business booked them for an event and they did not show up. We were told they were broke down and going to send their 'second truck'..by the food truck 'concierge' we were using. Then the story changed to they were in an accident and truck was on the way... No truck. I emailed and called at least 3 times receiving no answer. No show, no call... just a text after our event was over. I would like to see proof of the accident...since the stories seemed to be conflicting and truly terrible customer experience. I won't be booking this truck or recommending it to anyone that has an event they need them to show up for. Just sad. Even if there was an accident, a phone call would have been the one thing you could have done.

Absolutely love Masa. Been to the Gilbert and chandler locations many times and they never disappoint. Sushi rolls have a great combination of flavors .. Many rolls have fish/veggies inside and outside the actual roll. You can't beat the quality, taste, and price. The staff is very attentive and you even get to enjoy a complimentary dessert that is light and a very pretty actually :)
