I've only had 1 sandwich here because it's so good that I refuse to try anything else. I get the Southwest Chicken sandwich and it's out of this world! Great staff, great environment and good drink options. Not a lot of food choices but if you're looking for a light meal this is the place. The sandwiches are a tad pricey but if you think about it, Subway charges 8 bucks for a cold lifeless sandwich. This is about 10 and you get a side.

I am a college junior at ASU downtown and would love living here if it weren't for the noise. I live on the second floor and it is impossible to sleep with the construction. There is construction right below us where they are building a coffee shop. Due to the pipes and the fact that they're drilling into concrete it sounds like there is a jackhammer in your bedroom... This occurred at 6am and when I complained they didn't even take the time to listen, just said "we're having a meeting" but yet here I am, awoken again, writing a review. Other than this the apartment is great, some little faults but nothing too excessive. Just know you'll never sleep past 9am...  Ps, this is the farthest thing from a college town. More adults than college kids. Don't expect to meet college kids unless you really try hard.
