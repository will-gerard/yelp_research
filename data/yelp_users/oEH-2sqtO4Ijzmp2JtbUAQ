Lots of stores, good upgrades. Play area needs to be upgraded horribly

Great products! The store itself is kind of small and cramped and there's not much room to navigate, especially if it's busy. The staff is super nice and friendly.

First time customer and it was horrible. The pretzels themselves were ok but then they doused them in a sour cream and onion powder that was absolutely horrible. The man behind the counter was rude and snotty. There were other employees standing around sharing a bag of pretzel bitz. Save yourself the problems and go to Auntie Annes instead

New to the area and I've been looking for some good hot and sour soup. When I'm sick, it's literally the only thing that helps. Cafe China's hot and sour soup was 100% out of this world! Best I've EVER had! They're super friendly and the prices are superb! You definitely get more than your money's worth! I can't wait to go back!

Seriously hate this place. Went to get my ID in October. Paid for it and got my temp, but never received the hard copy. I haven't actually needed it until today and I realized I still didn't have it. Called them and was informed that it was returned undeliverable (shouldn't have been) and that they destroyed it in Dec. No phone call or anything in the mail saying they had it. And now I have to pay for a new one? No. The lady on the phone was horrible and rude.

Over priced. Rude staff. Not worth it.

I have been a huge fan of Steak and Shake since I could remember. I absolutely loved their burgers, UNTIL my hubs took me to Freddys and my tastebuds literally exploded! Everything was delicious! The bread and sauce, the meat, the cheese! And because it was my first time there, the staff gave me a giant bowl of custard with caramel and I lost it! I can not wait to go back!

It's ok. It always seems to be dirty when we go in and there's trash inside the chairs. The staff is nice for the most part.
