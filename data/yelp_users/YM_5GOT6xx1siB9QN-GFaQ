Got a room for $50/ night and It really was better than expected! The staff were very polite and funny, and made me feel at ease and welcome at the hotel. The continental breakfast was quite good considered how inexpensive the stay was. The room was well accommodated, had great lighting and was very clean. The only thing i can really say was lacking was the bedding. The blankets were thin and pillows were small. But I would definitely stay here again :)

Great Hotel, stayed here for a single night during Saboten Con, very comfortable rooms and hotel staff were friendly and helpful even despite the somewhat hectic and bizarre events occurring during the convention. The room was clean and had very nice accommodations. You pay more to stay here, but you also get more, its worth it if you have the cash to burn for comfort.  They also use Aveda products for the complimentary shampoos and soaps, which is a really nice touch imo.

Great atmosphere, servers were really attentive, but the most important thing about the restaurant was missing: good food. I ordered a white pizza and 2 drinks and the pizza was a little less than mediocre. the ricotta was bland, the whole pizza was bland, and the dough used was just unimpressive. It was lacking spices more basil or garlic would have really made it better, me and my friend had to add ample amounts of salt and pepper to it to get it to develop any flavor. and when I'm paying $17 for a single pizza i definitely expect a lot more from the quality. Sorry.
