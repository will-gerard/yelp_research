Don't know why I continue to go to Einstein. Must be because my kids like the potato bagels so much.   I will have to agree that they are pretty good - doughy and yummy toasted w/ cream cheese.  As for the other bagels, they don't compare to "real" NY bagels.  I keep searching for something healthy on the menu but cannot find it.  I ordered a turkey sandwich on a thin bagel.  It was alright, but the service at this Einstein was undesirable. It took the help 15 minutes to get out one toasted bagel and the turkey sandwich.  Not too many customers and 4 employees trying to assemble a sandwich. I wanted to jump behind that counter and show them how it's done!

I love Goldman's.  I go there often, mainly for the soup.  Love all the soups, but my favorites are the Lima Bean and Navy Bean.  Cabbage soup is exceptional too.   Chompies Cabbage soup has a bitter taste.  No comparison. Enjoy the Jerusalem Salad as well. Chicken is always really tender. Healthy meal choice.   Patty melt is great but expensive.  Reuben is good. The whole family works there and they work very hard.

Recently bought a dishwasher at Lowe's.   Dishwasher was a complete nightmare!  Didn't clean dishes well, so noisy. Called Lowe's to complain.  Their installation dept. worked with me the whole way.  They sent  service guys out twice and then the machine was deemed  a "lemon."   The Installation Dept. at Lowe's has amazing service.  They ended up replacing the  dishwasher.  Even though the experience of having a horrible dishwasher was bad, the service actually made up for all the aggravation.

Wow, since my last post, I've replaced that dishwasher and I'm on my 2nd one. This one's a lemon too!!  I went in the other day to replace this one. They gave me an upgrade and I had to add an add'l $75 but I'm upgraded and waiting for the new one to come in. Third time's a charm?  We'll wait and see.  Thanks Lowe's...so far, you've been amazing.

Recently went in to buy some suits for all the guys in the family for a special occasion.  Seemed like a no-brainer with all the help they offer there.  Men's Wearhouse is a one-stop shop.  Find the suit. Easy. All price ranges.  They help you accessorize.  Everyone looks like a million bucks. Sales are good too.  They also offer dressy casual clothes.  Great jeans and fun button-down shirts.

Great place to go when I need a quick and healthy lunch.  I get the Baja salad w/ mahi on it. Healthy green lettuce.  Lots of fish. Dressing on the side.  I also enjoy the ahi tacos.  Great lunch deal.

Italian food is typically not my first choice of cuisine, but I had guests in town and they wanted Italian food. I had been to this restaurant about 3 times prior but cannot remember enjoying the food as much as I had today.  This restaurant is truly worth the 5 stars.   Starts out with a warm greeting and fantastic service through and through. Yes, Ravioli ala Nina is amazing. They make the pasta paper thin and stuff it with fresh cheese and spinach.  The cream sauce and marinara sauce on top is so delicious.  Love the Veal Francese.  They don't skimp on the veal in this dish.  Food came out so hot and had plenty of the veal, capers, mushrooms, capers, artichokes,  and a savory lemon sauce.  The pasta side dish has a really delicious, really fresh marinara sauce.   They finish your meal w/ a complimentary Sambuca!  We did not have a reservation, but it's a good idea to make one if you can. Definitely recommend this place.

Why do people go to Olive Garden?  Why did i go here today? Simple answer: with force.   I HAD to go where a member of the family chose to go.  I haven't eaten here in about 8 years.  Many reasons which were confirmed tonight. Pasta was mushy. The "famous" salad actually had decent flavor but was drenched in dressing.  Breadsticks were a bit hard and tasted like buttered white bread.  Fish was breaded but okay tasting.  Pizza was not so good. Didn't like the cheese.  To sum up the whole meal: it was like heating up a "t.v. dinner."

I think Ray's has very good pizza as far as Ny style pizza goes. I'm surprised that the reviews are so inconsistent. I think when you compare pizza from different restaurants, you have to compare cheese to cheese. Forget the meats, etc.  .  Pizza should be judged on just the crust, sauce, and cheese. Ray's makes a great slice. Crust is perfect. Crispness on bottom and I can still  do the NY foldover.  I'd recommend this place for a traditional slice. Note: It's always been very clean when I'm there and I like that there's plenty of seating.  My kids enjoy the sports channels.

A family member recently was sent to this facility after a joint replacement. Bottom line: You could die in there and nobody would notice for several hours.

Loved the Margherita Pizza. Simple yet so delicious.   Crazy thing though...my favorite thing there was the Bruschetta.  Had the "3-way."  Oh, the freshness of those tomatoes!   Unbelievable. Lots of basil. So good.  The bean brushcetta came in 2nd.  We didn't really save room for dessert but shared some strawberry crepes anyway-or at least tried to.   The kids went in for the kill and it was gone in about 2.5 seconds.  Have to say though, I enjoyed my one bite thoroughly.

I enjoy their pizza. Nice big slices. I like the "crispyness" on the bottom of the slice,   Today we got the Pepperoni/ Sausage and the BBQ Chicken. Slices were huge so one slice each was enough to fill us up.  I'm giving them 4 stars because I enjoy the pizza. My head today wanted to give them 2 stars for service but my heart couldn't.   Service was slow. One girl was working register and getting slices until suddenly a girl emerged from the back. She immediately put her hand up to her mouth and stood there dumbfounded "Which way did they go, which way did they go?"  Where were the usual server boys  today?

Love Penzey's!  I don't cook major recipes any more, but I still like to cook a bit. I may not use many of the spices in Penzey's but the store makes me want to.  What I love about this place is that it has any spice you can think of or never heard of before going in there.  They have samples of every spice, for sniffing.  I think I sniffed every spice there. I didn't get out of there for over an hour.  I bought a few things and I've used them all so far.  Love the cocoa, BBQ 3000, the almond extract, rosemary and more.   Go to Penzey's...get inspired....or not...just go for the experience. p.s. staff is very helpful and cheery.

Love Joe's.  What a great hang out! I love the outdoor area the best.  The picnic tables are so casual and I want to hang out there for hours, especially on a cool night.  The kids feel so free out there.  I give the fun atmosphere 5 stars.  I give the food 4 stars. Had the Ahi Tuna Sandwich. Sounded great on the menu.  I didn't want to be disappointed, but I couldn't help it.  The tuna was kinda dry. Wasn't happy about it.  Liked the coleslaw.  Onion rings were really good. Really nice  seasoning and the crispy crunchy coating was great.  Shakes were a bit runny but a good taste overall.

I enjoy coming to First Watch when I'm in the mood for  a relaxed, easy-going experience for breakfast.  I always get in quickly and we get service quickly.  Plenty of space in the restaurant - bright and airy. The menu is perfect for breakfast.  Lots of healthy options.   Omelets are tasty. Love the french toast and pancakes too.

Have to give this place 3-4 stars for food but 5 stars for service. Great service so I've gotta average it out. Basic chain restaurant food. My shrimp tacos weren't so great. Didn't care for the crispy, dry flour tortilla. I prefer the corn.  Not much shrimp in tacos. Sauces were okay.  The seared ahi salad looked pretty good. Tasted the pulled pork sandwich and I really liked the savory sauce...not too sweet. Pizza was okay. A bit greasy but edible. I prefer thin crust. Service was amazing.  Someone in my party ordered a mojito and her glass came to the table sticky. She told the waitress. Waitress offered to get her a new glass but she said she was okay and wrapped a napkin around it and was fine.  Even though she was fine w/ the glass, the manager came over and offered to replace the drink and she did.  Excellent customer service as the waitress did not just "sit on it." She took the minor complaint to management and they took a minor complaint seriously and did something/anything about it to please the customer. Top, top service. Had to bump up to 4 stars.

Out in Chandler today and was excited to finally try this place that was recommended by some locals.  Wasn't sure what to expect for a sub shop.  Different concept as far as first impressions.  Place was packed and it was about 1pm.  . Every table taken. Fireman equipment and artifacts everywhere.  Right away I'm trying to break down the menu as fast as I can since people behind me are waiting and it's an order-at-the-counter place.   Staff was great.  Asked what I was in the mood for. Pointed out a few items.  I went for a sub w/ turkey, mushrooms, and Swiss.  I asked if the mushrooms were fried.  The employee explained how they have a special press that steams the meat and cheese together before it goes on the roll.  Nothing there is fried.    Sandwich was very good. Enjoyed the crispness of the roll.  There was a great amount of turkey, unlike most popular sub shops around.  I would have liked a bit more cheese and mushrooms.  A little more "savoryness" but I think that could have come in had I chosen one of their specialty sauces.  I'm definitely trying one of the sauces next trip! I think I needed a little more "zip!"

Good stuff! Be prepared to try every single flavor in there.  You can't just go in and order. Try as many as you like - until you feel the server is fed up with you. The girl behind the counter was patient as she scooped out little samplers of about 8 flavors between my friend and me. Had to try the blue cheese flavor.  Actually pretty good, but when I was thinking about how I was eating blue cheese, I couldn't bring myself to ordering an entire serving of it.   Ended up ordering  the mint chocolate chip which was amazing.  The REAL taste of mint was refreshing. The perfect amount of dark chocolate pieces.  I also ordered the salted caramel since everyone raved over it.  Didn't taste any hints of salt at all. Very rich and creamy but nothing special about it.  I think the best part of my experience at S.R. was the marshmallow they torched and put on top of my dessert.  The marshmallow was to die for....get the marshmallow. Did I mention that they're homemade? Toasty goodness.

Pretty good pizza here even though I've been loyal to Ray's down the driveway.   Maybe I like Ray's cheese better?  This place does a nice crust/dough though.  Sauce is good too.  I like "Fran's  favorite" which has mushrooms and fresh Roma tomatoes.  Everything here does taste very fresh.  The House salad is way better than most other places as they use Romaine ( I think) lettuce as opposed to non-nutritional Iceberg.  Fresh tasting and I appreciate the fact that I ordered it drizzled very lightly w/ Balsamic dressing and they brought it out w/ just the right amount.  Lunch specials are a great deal!

My favorite restaurant....thank you Chef Chris! Chef Chris does it all...greeting, bussing, water boy, cook....everything. The food is so fresh and so delicious.  I will eat anything he brings out. He works his magic.   Such a cute place!  So charming. I love how Chef is able to juggle it all and still be able to socialize w/ the customers.  His modesty comes out when you rave to him about how amazing his food is.  Chef Chris is a people-pleaser.

Cafe Monarch is everything and more that fans say it is.  It is "more" when you experience it for yourself.   Lately, I've been going to some really nice restaurants in town and I cannot find anything that can top Chef Christopher's food.   Everything here is made right in front of you and it's so fresh.  Chef Christopher rarely serves the same thing twice. He's so innovative and comes up with the best flavor profiles. Loved the ribs - they were so rich and fell off the bone.  The sauce and the polenta were amazing.  Every dessert I've had there has been amazing too.  Usually something involving a fruit but also chocolate, which seems to be a must when you go there.   Talk to Chef Christopher.  He is a very  humble chef .  His talents are top-notch and really haven't been met by any other valley restaurants I've been to.

I really like Pita Jungle.   One of my favorite dishes here is the Lentil Fatoosh Salad.  I love the combo of the lentils on top of the lettuce, w/ the fried onions and veggies.  The lemony dressing is really great too.  I have to say though, every time I come, it seems to be made a bit differently.  Sometimes there's not enough lettuce, sometimes too many onions.  I find that the consistency of pretty much all their dishes changes a lot.    Prices are fair and the portions are unnecessarily gigantic.

Love 2 Sister's Skin Spa and the "sisters" are great.  There is always a sister there (Courtney or Erin) and I'm always greeted by warm friendly faces at the front desk.  It's a place to feel comfortable in and I'm there often to get a brow wax, facial, or peel.  No stuffy attitudes here. The boutique in the reception area has really cute outfits and jewelry and is reasonably priced.  There is a whole make-up section where they sell make up or apply it.  I know that lots of ladies get permanent makeup as well (tatoo).    Go get a facial...they're all capable and terrific!

Great place to go for hot dogs.  I've been to several around town and none of the places are as clean or as cute as this one.   We didn't get anything "fancy" or different.  Just a grilled hot dog on one of their homemade buns, which by the way, somehow melt in your mouth. Those buns are special!  I probably would have liked it steamed even though my dog was grilled.  Fries were good and had the perfect amount of salt.   Next time we'll try the sweet potato fries. Price was really good..  $5.25 for both.  There was enough there for 2 people to share. They have some interesting sodas and other drinks in the cooler that you don't see anywhere else.  I think my favorite thing about this place though,  was the sweet man at the cash register with the French accent.  He must be the owner.  With service like that, I hope this place continues to do well!

Went in today. Love the service sooo much.  The owner was  behind the counter and  is soooo sweet.  I think he's from France? The service was great as the cooks from behind the counter brought my kids' food out to the table.  It's always so clean and we love sitting outsisde in this beautiful weather. The sweet potato fries were delicious!

Checked out The Vig Uptown for lunch. It wasn't as crowded as I'd heard it gets.  That was good.  Got in. Airy and spacious.  50's architecture inside. The back patio feels like your outdoors but your in.  Wanted to sit out there but there were no tables available.  Enjoyed the special salad of the day - a Thai shrimp salad.  Nice fresh greens,  carrots, peppers, citrusy cucumbers, great dressing.  Shrimp was grilled to perfection. Could've used a couple more though.   Food there looks really fresh and it's easy to get something that's relatively healthy and light.    Next time I'm going to try the Anchiote Salmon. That looked amazing.  Lots of great flavor combinations going on.

Back again.  Still thinking about the flatbread pizza w/ tandoori chicken. I told my friend not to order it as an appetizer b/c I felt it would be too much food intake.  One of the best things I've eaten in a while.  I can't wait to order that as my MAIN dish next time. Soooooo good. You gotta try it! The chutney and all the flavor combinations were perfect.  It didn't sound so special on the menu, but it is!

This is a fantastic salon because the 2 owners work together with their 2 assistants.  It is small and they cater to you as an individual.  They show respect and are not "high up on their horses."  They listen to what the customer wants and suggest what they think would work best for the client's hair.   They are both exremely talented stylists and colorists.

Tried JJ's bagels twice.  Liked them very much.  Actually liked them better than Kashmans.   They had a nice firmness to the outside and a bit chewy like I like them.  I still prefer the size of  a New York bagel to these, but they had good texture.  I thought the staff was very friendly, especially one of the male employees in the morning.  Don't know his name but he met me at the door w/ quite a greeting and  also said goodbye when I left.  Big smile.  I felt like he enjoyed this place and that goes a long way.  I'll have to come back to see how they make a sandwich!

Just thinking about the "meal" I had tonight makes me want to throw up - literally.  I was going for something healthy.  Ordered the seared ahi tuna, asparagus, and side salad.  When it arrived, first sight, I said to myself "blach!"  Yes, maybe i ordered boring stuff but at least try and present it nicely!  The tuna came in a huge, thick square that was grayish brown. Ugh! Not really seared. Just brown.  Cold. The least they could have done was sliced it up pretty. It was this huge hunk and like over an inch thick....just thinking about it....all brown and gray and cold and raw inside... Asparagus was so dry and was a bit brownish. Really cold.  Salad was a bit of iceberg w/ dressing on the side.   My mom ordered a pulled bbq chicken sandwich. Meh. As I was walking out I was looking at other people's food.  Nothing special to look at at all. Never going back even if the rest of my party wants to go. I'll just walk over to In-n-Out and camp out in the parking with my burger box until they're done.

I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time and finally did.  I had very high expectations and most of them were met. Very large and roomy inside. Lots of space between tables. Love the simplicity of the tables. White cloth, simple glasses, little vase with a fresh, simple flower.  Decor was simplistic. Earthy, environmentally friendly looking and a bit retro in some respects.   The waiter was professional and friendly. He was happy to give suggestions.  The help was amazing. Always refilling our water glasses even though we had a bottle of water on the table. We never filled our glasses ourselves. The staff stayed on top of everything.   Wedge salad was pretty good with the Green Goddess dressing. I'm not sure what the bitterness was from though.  Grilled cheese appetizer was delicious.  I ordered the mahi special.  I'm not sure why the shrimp in it tasted like it was previously frozen. My dish was nothing special but the ambience and service made up for it.  I would go back to see what else I could try.  I'd be up for another adventure.

I've been here a couple times.  First time, I ordered sea bass.  It was okay, but not worth the price.  It was a bit oily as were the garnishes.  Enjoyed the Spinach salad I had, the second time I went.  My kids love the burgers and the pizzas. Great kids menu.    Service is inconsistent and there's somewhat of a snobby feeling in the air from the staff.  Not sure why...just feel it there when I walk in.  I think the greeters are just not friendly.

Nice fresh tasting food.  I had shrimp tacos. Large portion. 3 tacos for $16. Nice and light. Clean tasting. Didn't like the cheese so much in it but good flavors.  Huge portion so I couldn't eat all 3. I think they should just knock one taco off the plate and lower the price to $11. We also had the pork sandwich. Delicious sauce. Pork was a bit tough but good flavors. Potato salad on side was delicious.  I am not a potato salad person but the dressing was really nice and not too much of it.   I will definitely come back again due to the fresh taste, selection on the menu, and friendly service. Also...they have a great happy hour!

Love this place!  Had the loaded chips appetizer -ah-mazing!  Sounds kinda mundane. We didn't know what we were getting and the first taste of the chips w/ the toppings was a party in my mouth. The potato chips are thick and cooked to perfection. The chips are topped with blue cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, chipotle sauce.  Layers of flavor!  One of the best things I've eaten in a while!  The pulled pork sandwiches are sooo good. "Different" type of bbq sauce. Not sweet. Rather it had more of a mustardy, savory flavor.   My family feels that they could have omitted the ham on the sandwich.  The mac and cheese was good. Not great, but good.  The wild salmon was good as was the side of veggies.  Overall, great meal. Great atmosphere. We sat out back.  Love the trees, the lighting, and the comfy chairs! oh....service there is amazing!  The servers know what they're doing. Everyone has a job and about 4 of them wait on you.  Check it out!

mmm...mmmm.....mmmm Delish!  The Toasted Coconut ice cream rocks!  Very creamy yet lots of texture in every bite with lots of toasted coconut throughout.   The dark chocolate was amazing!  Such a rich taste.  My family also had the icecream sandwiches, but they were sorry they got them. They felt like they were eating more cookie than ice cream.  So although they were very good, next time they will just get the pure icecream. Maybe a cookie on the side?  Such a cute place and the employees were very pleasant. Check it out!

Saw Dr. Giancola today.  I was referred there by another doctor in the practice (who's also very good)  for a second opinion.  Great bedside manner. Personality is great. Patient.  Spent time with me. Explained things quite simply.  I would highly recommend him.
