Had breakfast here last week and now hooked!!! Their turkey sausage links taste decadent, their marble rye and sourdough is made from scratch, in house.... French toast is great, their Ruben-esque panini.... PHENOMENAL!!!!!! Best Reuben I've ever had. My son and I split it, he loved it! This place is amazing. Only been here twice, everything that comes out of the kitchen is fresh and looks amazing. Can't wait to go back.

The staff is great, great food but my FAVORITE is the Kale 12 salad!  It is the best salad I've ever had.  I order it with the dressing on the side. Filled with delicious grilled veggies. .... AMAZING!

Was my first time ever going there, was just about to buy over $100 worth of vitamins and suddenly my six year old son had to use the restroom. He asked very nicely, begging the guy and he refused to let him use their bathroom. Said that we have to leave and go to the restaurant down the way. Very disappointed. We walked out, went to Bed Bath and Beyond and spent money there. LOL. Not cool at all.

Have been to Many t-mobile stores over the years,  not always a good experience, but EVERY TIME I go to this location the are AMAZING!  They have always help me out with all of my needs. I went in there today super frustrated with my phone and Kyra and the other associates had me happy and laughing by the end of it!  Always the best employees at this location. Will no longer go to any other.    THE GOOD KARMA T-MOBILE!

HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT GO WITH DIRECT TV!!!!    I have been a customer with this company for 7 years now.  I was going to cancel and go with Cox.  Direct TV offered me a deal that seemed too good to be true in order to get me to stay, installed the equipment, DID NOT do the licensing agreement with me due to technical difficulties, then canceled some of the channels. In order to get those channels I would have to upgrade up two more packages.  I called to cancel service and they told me that regardless, I am under contract and I can cancel for an almost $500 fine.  From the other reviews they like to do this a lot.  That is dirty pool to promise an amazing deal, get you "under contract" then take the deal away and tell you that you are screwed!  The supervisor was horrible as well.  Very condescending!  They are amazing at loosing long standing customers!

FINALLY found my forever hair guy!  Markis is AMAZING! He really listens to his clients, is fun, great personality, loves what he does and cares about what he's doing.  I completely trust and value his opinion. He knows what he's doing and is excellent at it!  I brought him a picture of what I wanted and now my blonde hair is a work of art! Absolutely beautiful!  If you want an exceptional hair stylist, he is your man! Very reasonable prices, PLUS  First time clients get 20% off! LOVE him!
