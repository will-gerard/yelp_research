I have never been to a restaurant that I could not find something nice to say until we ate at the Melting Pot. First, we were greeted by a hostess who was coughing with her mouth uncovered and sniffling when we walked in to an empty restaurant. She asked if we had a reservation and we said no. She acted as though seating us was going to be a problem while rapidly tapping her fingers over her mouth and nose. Did I mention she was visibly sick? She said nothing and ran off into another area of the restaurant. When she returned she said she needed our full name and phone number, "In case there is a problem with your credit card." What?!   After a few minutes we were seated, she offered us drinks, told us about the menu, and let us know our server "Jeremy" would be right over. We waited for Jeremy for approximately 10-15 minutes.   We were ready to order all of our items but he walked away after we ordered our cheese. We ordered the alpine cheese fondu, it was awful. Raw garlic and uncooked wine left an awful after taste; it was nearly inedible. Jeremy never came back to see how we liked the cheese but showed up long after we had finished.   We ordered our salads, asked for more water and tea, and Jeremy was off again. About ten minutes later, a busser came by to fill our drinks. Our salads were soaking in dressing, which made them really soggy and overpowering.     We finished our salads without seeing Jeremy. Waited another 15 minutes till we saw Jeremy again after he greeted a new table next to us. We ordered our chocolate and asked for the check at the same time. The chocolate was good but the bananas were hard, crunchy and very unripe.   We will not be back, as there are many local, upscale restaurants that supply quality ingredients, flavors, and service. This place seems antiquated and out of touch, maybe that's why the place was dead.

I LOVE this place it is so addicting! It is always pretty busy and the space is small but it is sooo worth it. The  Tortas are THE perfect sandwich, their meat is so flavorful and the bun that they use is soft and toasted with mayo, lettuce, tomato, their homemade salsa and onion. My husband and I usually share the chicken Torta, a bowl of their AMAZING pozole, and a couple of Carnitas tacos. Flavorful, affordable, delicious! Enough said.

Teakwoods has a great bar atmosphere, and is great for watching sporting events. We frequent this place because it is so close, but also because they have great specials and delicious food. Their menu is huge but I usually stick to the El Hefe wings and sweet potato fries w/ jalapeno ranch. their burgers are really big and very yummy also.

WOW!!!! I am SHOCKED that this place has managed to maintain such a high rating. My husband and I went here for our anniversary, Walking in it seemed like a unique place with a unique atmosphere. I could not have been more wrong.  When we were seated in the dining room we immediately noticed the dated decor. The yellow lights, and brass picture frames with pastel ocean scenes. It was like they haven't changed a thing since the 80's.We were berated by three different people asking us for our drink order when we first sat down, which was not only confusing but annoying.   when looking at the menu we noticed there was nothing under 40$ which is fine I will gladly pay for an AMAZING meal. I ordered the fillet and Alaskan King Crab legs...I am going to emphasize legs here. My husband not being a seafood fan ordered the 14oz boneless Rib eye. Now where to start, Our meals came with salad, vegetable of the day, and your choice of a baked potato or rice pilaf. First the salad was Iceberg lettuce but despite that their house dressing was still decent. Now onto the meal Our plates came out and I was SHOCKED and HORRIFIED, My 40 dollar meal consisted of a child's fist sized baked potato, which incidently was the best part of the meal, a pile of vegetables, zucchini, cauliflower, and black olives...yeah think about that for a minute, they where BOILED no seasoning and inedible. My fillet was tiny which was fine I was not expecting a huge hunk of meat, cooked perfectly but had NO seasoning and tasted awful. What a waste for that cow that sacrificed his life to be cooked in this place. Last but certainly not least my Alaskan King Crab leg... yeah that is right ONE leg. When she sat my plate down I just started laughing I could not believe I just wasted 40 on this. The server said wow that's a leg as if I was getting some deal. My husbands meal had the same problems no seasoning and boiled vegetables. Give me a break this place is a joke! I have never payed 100.00 drinks not included for food that was so terrible. I have no clue how this place is in business and I will scream it to the mountain tops DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY... Unless of course you like bland inedible food. Go to Red Lobster you'll have a better meal at less money. And that's saying a lot, I try not to eat at chains...

Brandon was great, he took the time to educate us on ways to help us make the most out of our older unit until we are ready to buy a new one. Everyone we talked to was very nice and their rates are very reasonable. So glad we found this family owned business!

Let me start off by saying that our server was friendly, friendlier than most I have had a Vietnamese restaurants. However after she took our order we did not see her again until it was time to pay the bill. There were about 6 or 7 other tables in the restaurant and other servers walked by us constantly and ignored the fact we had been done and sitting there for 15 minutes.   Now onto the food, I got the easy rare Pho, when the Pho came out  I did not smell the usual aroma of onion, ginger and other spices that make Pho the best soup ever.  Instead I smelled salt. This was troubling. After tasting the broth I immediately knew what I was smelling and now tasting, beef bouillon. There was a very subtle flavor almost like watered down  Pho. The taste and flavor of the bouillon lingered on my tongue and left and and odd feeling in my mouth. This was probably the saddest excuse for Pho I have ever had. Real Pho requires a missive amount of bones and spices to create the broth that soothes the soul. Now onto my husband, order the charbroiled pork Bun, his vegetables were mushy the pork was not anywhere on par with other places we've been. Again watered down flavor.   To top all of this off this place is more expensive that other Vietnamese restaurants we frequent. Save your money, visit another Vietnamese restaurants we have in the area, there are much, much, much better ones than this place.

First off I would like to start off by saying if you are used to "trendy" sushi bars this place is not going to be for you. We have been going to Mido for about two years. The sushi is always good and the prices are fair.  They now have half off happy hour twice a day.  And all you can eat sushi for 20 bucks.  Each meal is served with fresh Miso soup salad and edamame plus Green tea, Red bean, or Mango sorbet to finish your meal  complimentary, if you started with that at other sushi bars you would be in 10 dollars deep before you got to your meal.  Some of their best rolls are, Mido roll- inside is tempura shrimp, avocado, and cucumber and is topped with spicy tuna tempura flakes and ponzu sauce.  Ray roll- Inside Spicy Tuna shrimp tempura and cucumber topped with avocado and ponzu sauce.  Over all great value, good food, relaxing atmosphere.

Love, love, love this place! Every time I have family visiting I always take them here. The food is great, the atmosphere is amazing. What a great and original idea.  It is pretty far out of town so plan to spend the evening there. LOVE IT!

When I first had Pho I was not crazy about it. Turns out I was eating it at the wrong place! I ordered the eye of round and brisket  Pho WOW it was so delicious, the broth had great flavor on its own much better then other places I have had. The beef was tender and not full of fat or gristle. This place took Pho and put it at the top of list on my favorite foods.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone just getting started or veterans. Its clean the service is good, and the food is really something special!

Words cannot express how much I love this place. Their pho Bo is where is is at! Their broth is amazing and let's get real the broth is the reason we all love pho. I get the number ten, eye of round and brisket pho, if you like your eye of round rare just ask they can bring it out on the side. I love cilantro in my pho so I ask for them to bring if out out with my garnish an vola it appears. Service is friendly, not corporate in your face robot service, so if you are looking for that you are in the wrong place. They recently changed their menu looks better. Want fresh coconut? They've got you covered they will crack a fresh one open for you! Their Vietnamese coffee yum! To all the ney Sayers that say this place is too expensive it is 15 dollars for two large bowls of pho, which we  always have left overs.  If you want to supersize your meal and yourself hit up the McDonalds.

The Dhaba is perfect, I could leave it at that... but I wont. The atmosphere is nice I love their cutlery and plates and tables. My husband and I love their Papdi Chatt appetizer, chicken tikka masala is amazing and another dish with spinach an chicken, sorry,  drawing a blank on the name. Every time we have been there our experience has been wonderful.   I will add one note, I am hoping this was just a fluke, but the last time we were in the owners were not there and the young Indian girl working there had on club music so loud I could not here my husband speak. At first I thought ok they just opened maybe they'll turn it off. Nope it played loudly the whole time. Also the bus girl and the Indian girl just disappeared we needed water and there was no one around, we waited 15 minutes plus for someone to get us our check, we actually had to stop the girl to ask for the check because she just kept walking by.  With this being said, we still love the Dhaba, and will continue visiting often. However if this ever happens again we might have to consider finding another place to get our Indian food.

Ok used to love this place when it first opened, key word used to. I will keep it short and simple the servers don't even know what is in a california roll. I always order a cali with all of my sushi because I find it refreshing, everyone knows that everywhere you go a california has crab avacado and cucumber. Well apparently not this place our roll came out and the sever fed us this line about how they were not putting cucumber in the roll anymore because it was cooked............. I know it made no sense to me either. I worked in a real sushi bar for many years so I know my suff, it is sad to me when I have to tell the servers what should be in a california roll. I am over this place.

To put it simply, calling this Japanese is insulting. It is a teriyaki place and they don't get that right. Corn syrup and sugar is not teriyaki sorry but no thanks. Also the staff is unfriendly and would rather stare at their cell phones then say hello. Won't be back.

My husband and I went here for dinner and it was a ghost town. We were the only people in the place and I soon found out why. The service was amazingly slow considering we were the only ones there. We ordered our burgers, you can build your own, and waited. They take the blue part of their name a little too seriously which I could handle except for the obnoxious blue tint on the windows...ugh. when our food arrived my order was incorrect, I was stunned by this seeing how they had one order and could not get that right. Whether it was the fault of the server of the kitchen who knows? I did not mention it I did not feel like waiting for it to be fixed.  So in short, bad food, bad service, unappealing atmosphere, and to top it all off an expensive price for a tasteless burger.

I cannot believe I have not reviewed this place yet! Fresh, homemade noodles large portions, cheap prices. Word of warning though, the service is terrible, keep that in mind when you go in and you'll enjoy your experience.  Five stars for the food. The service takes it down to four, sometimes 3 depending on the day.

This place is a really deelish! Fresh ceviche and their queso dip was really good. The only negatives were the servers did not seem to understand English very well so that made it difficult to make sure we were on the same page and when you first walk in you  are hit by a wall of fish smell. The owner was very nice and the food was fresh. Give it a try.

I love this place, everything is so tasty and fresh. My only complaint is that it's too far away and I can't get there as often as I would like.

Crap food, crap service. Not sure what the appeal is here. the place was dead we waited an hour for our food, I could have made my own eggs and bacon by that time and at 10$ a pop could have fed 20 people. One piece of bacon and runny eggs (ugh). The service was terrible too, we were outside and it was warm, our server never came by to check on us, apologize about the wait, fill our drinks etc. People with larger tables were getting their food and we had been there longer, truth be told she probably forgot about us. When she did resurface she smelled awful, like cigarettes. I love a good dive breakfast place, this is a dive but far from good.

I love everything about this place, the atmosphere the vibe, and the food. We have had drinks here several times before but never eaten. We recently purchased a Groupon deal and really enjoyed our experience. The place was very crowed for a wednesday night and we were glad we had reservations. Service was very good, despite the fact that our server was very busy. Our food was really good, though I must spotlight the salmon dish. It truly was one of the best things I have ever eaten. Marinaded in lemongrass with coconut rice. Everything was paired perfectly!

I am not sure why I haven't rated this place until now. I have been coming here for a couple of years and always enjoy their shrimp spring rolls, Vietnamese iced coffee, and pork vermicelli bowl. I can't speak to the pho as I haven't had it. The portions are good, the food is very delicious, and  the atmosphere is nice. My only minor complaint is that the service is cold, efficient but cold. It doesn't bother me I've come to expect it, if this will be an issue for you than I wouldn't recommend.

I love this place, the owner is so friendly and very sweet! I decided to give this place a try after the spring roll factory, next door, closed. Boba and Donuts started serving  banh mi and other Vietnamese delights. The prices are very reasonable, and a great value! Try the pork sandwich and any of the croissants they are spectacular!

The Spring Roll Factory is about five minutes from my house which is proving to be a big problem. I say that it's a problem because their food is so delicious and far too assessable . I have not tried the pho yet only because the temperatures outside are too hot but their Banh Mi sandwiches are spectacular! The bread is perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, the bread to filling ratio is spot on. Ive had other Banh Mi sandwiches and there is always too much bread and not enough delicious vegetables.  Do yourself a favor and stop into the Spring roll Factory and support local business!   Tip- ask for extra veggies :)

Maybe it was an off night? Food was expensive, ordered a gyro platter which is pictured with a pita and two sides. I was charged extra for the pita, the meat was greasy and didn't taste like it should. I have had much better for less money. On a positive note their hummus is really good.

This is my favorite neighborhood Japanese restaurant. They have a great happy hour, the bento boxes are a fantastic deal, sushi is always fresh, ramen, and pork belly are to die for. Service is the absolute best I have ever received at this type of restaurant, ( if they are very busy service is a little slower but still very friendly and accommodating).  Definitely give this place a try, we need to support local businesses doing things right and this place is a gem!

Came here on a rainy night, had the pho bo. The atmosphere was very nice and the pho was delicious. I have never had a pho with broth that I haven't had to add siracha, chili paste etc. The broth had a strong cinnamon taste and at first it was odd but once I added lime I found that the broth was perfectly balanced and satisfied all of my cravings.  Our service was a little spotty (they were very busy and didn't seem to be properly staffed)  otherwise this place easily deserves five stars. I can't wait to go back!

Not the best sushi and food on the planet. With that being said their happy hour on Sunday is pretty amazing. We got a drink, four appetizers, and two rolls for $22. That is a great deal.  Our favorite was the crispy spicy tuna. We will definitely keep this place in mind when we are craving sushi on Sunday.

This place was pretty terrible. Only went because we had a groupon, server did a good job but the food was terrible. They had a DJ at 4 in the afternoon on a week day, it was just all around bad. Perhaps a better option for the younger crowd that needs to feel like they are in a night club. Won't be back.
