I met a friend here for coffee a few weeks ago and really liked it!   I had a mocha java that was really good, maybe the best mocha I've ever had, in fact.  The price was around $4, pretty comparable to most coffee shops. The gals behind the counter were exceptionally friendly.   The inside was a bit small, but it was a beautiful day to enjoy the weather on the spacious patio. There seemed to be quite a few business folks inside on laptops though, so it'd probably be a great spot to get some out of office work done.   It gets a 4 star for now because I've only tried one item, but next time I'm down that way, I will certainly try it again.

I went here because my normal salon was booked and I really wanted to like it. The salon is rather large and had nice pedicure chairs. My spa pedicure turned out great. The gal did a nice job and im happy with my pretty pink toesies!   My gel manicure, however, has left me debating if I should go somewhere else to get it fixed. (See photo) I asked for grey and the color is more brown. I also asked the gal not to use an electric nail drill to get my old polish off and soak instead but she did it anyway. My polish is uneven and she didn't get the sides very well. They are also filed uneven. I tried to say something but she didn't speak english very well, so I gave up. Super bummed i'm stuck with these for 2 weeks unless I want to go somewhere else and pay.  The price was good - 25 for the pedi and only 20 for the mani and the massage was great, but I certainly wont be back any time soon.

By far the best taco shop in the valley. Their rolled tacos are delicious. I've had them dozens of time and they never disappoint. The restaurant is older and what you'd expect of a normal "taco shop", but it is very clean and the staff is always very friendly. They also have the best red hot sauce I've tasted yet. Yuuuuuuum.

This is my favorite bar in North Phoenix. There are tons of TVs, perfect for football season if you want to watch multiple games. There is an OTB, not really my thing, but pretty cool anyhow. There are pool tables and dart boards and a little claw machine! The restaurant is very open. There are places to sit at tables or booths, a bar off to the left and nice seating on the patio.   The best part, though, the food. I frickin love their food. So many great things to choose from and they have a large menu selection. Some of my favorites are the pulled pork sandwich, nachos (they make their own cheese sauce) and the burgers. My absolute favorite is the bacon cheese fries (sub seasoned waffle fries for regular). You are in a serious carb coma after eating them, but whatevs, they are too good to even care.   The staff is always consistently friendly and on point. I really do love it here and am super happy it's so close to home!

Uncle Sam wants me and I want Uncle Sam's!!!! Yuuu-uuum!  The all-american sub is absolutely, by far my favorite sub in the world. The bread is great and it is toasted to absolute perfection. I can't even count how many times I have oredered it and it always comes out the same way and never disappoints! The cheese steak sub is also really good and their pizza and wings are pretty awesome too!!!  I usually get it to go, but if you are planning on stopping in, they always have sporting events on TV which is pretty cool. It's kind of a small dining area, but it's fun if you are in the mood for a sports bar atmosphere.

I feel sort of strange reviewing a bank, but it is a place I frequent often so it seems ok to review. Plus, at my old job, my crazy boss dealt with SEVEN different banks of which he had me personally take deposits to each (sometimes on the same day, fun drive...not) so I feel well qualified to judge it in comparison to other banks.  Anyways, on with the review already...I love Desert Schools. I don't see myself ever switching to another bank for any purpose. I have been banking with them for 4 years and have never had even one issue. In fact, they often resolve issues for me, such as removing those nasty little NSF fees. I always have a really pleasant experience when I go in, all of the tellers are super friendly and are well-trained. I also never have to wait in much of a line.   In comparison to the several other banks I used to deal with, I feel that DS takes the time to educate each of their employees far more than other banks. I also feel as if they don't pressure you to open other services. Many of the the banks that I used to deposit at for my old boss would constantly hound me about opening up another account, or line of credit, etc.   If anyone talks about bank issues, I always find myself raving about my wonderful banking experiences!!! Thank you Desert Schools for being awesome!

I can't say that I would have ventured here on my own accord, but I have been twice with groups of friends that picked the spot and I had a blast both times. The bar is pretty divey, but they service is friendly and the drinks are cheap. There was live music on both occasions I was in and it really was pretty good. I wouldn't say this spot or the patrons were too classy, but if you are lookin to have fun on the cheap, enjoy good live music and let loose without feeling judged, this is the place!

I went here a few weeks ago on a Saturday night and had a total blast! I must say that this is the first bar that I have found in my hood that I really enjoyed.  The environment is very relaxed and low key. Everyone was really friendly and dressed casual and I felt totally comfortbale. The bar itself isn't fancy or anything but it's well maintained. There are some pool tables in the open room and I think I remember seeing darts too. They have wii in the corner and we played some wii bowling in which the many cheap beers helped me to bowl my best game ever, 6 strikes in a row for a 231!!!  The bartender was right on point and she had a fatastic personality to boot. I ended up tipping her $20 because I was so impressed with her and thought she was for sure the most rad bartender I've ever encountered.  This place was really awesome and I can see myself making this a hang out when I want to grab a drink close to home.

I love coming here for an after work drink in a relaxing environment. They have a decent wine selection with a nice happy hour menu offering some really tasty treats. I love the bruschetta, particularly the brie, apple and caramelized onions - delicious!  The staff has always been incredibly friendly and attentive. I sit on the patio almost every time and love it. They have lights strung across the patio and it gives a great ambiance in the evening. I've been on a Saturday night before and they had live entertainment - just a guy and his guitar - and it was the perfect touch to the already amazing atmosphere.  I also attended a networking event here for women in my industry and they handled it perfectly. The staff was spot on, offered perfect little bites and made it a very enjoyable event.  I really like how laid back and relaxed the environment is and am so happy it's so close to work that I can make it a regular spot to unwind.

I ordered take out for lunch here today and I had a great experience. I called and placed my order and the girl that answered the phone was really friendly and nice. She said that the order would be ready in ten minutes and when I arrived ten minutes later, she had it all packaged up waiting for me. I asked her to throw in some bread to dunk in my soup and she kindly added it, no charge. Suuweeet! My coworker had ordered the chicken strips and the girl told me that they were small today, so she had them throw in a few extra. Who does that? This chick rocks!  My throat was really sore, so I opted for a cup of french onion soup! It is awesome here, definitely the best I have had. They serve it with a baguette and raisin bread that is to die for.   I only ran in to get my order, so I can't really comment on the table service or the restaurant itself, but that chick totally made my day by being so nice, so this location gets 5 stars from me!!!

Me and a friend of mine frequent this place a few times a month. We always sit out back on the little patio and enjoy the weather. We usually go on Friday nights and this place is always dead. I would not recommend going here if you are looking to socialize or party it up at the bar. I like that about it though. We can sit on the patio, chit chat and enjoy our food and not be bothered.   We usually get half priced appetizers for happy hour and a few drinks. It ends up being pretty cheap. I love the nachos! They are really good here and they put lots of crap on top and don't skimp!   Couple of negatives...service tends to be really slooooow on occasion. We went here last Friday and our server only came out twice and we had to hunt him down to get our check and then another 15 mins later when he never came out to grab the card to run. (he was pretty cute though and apologized, so all was forgiven!) Other bad thing is on the rare occasion when there are other people on the patio, it gets kind of awkward because the placement of the tables are so close.   Other than those few little issues, I really like going here to grab a bite and hang out.

I used to live right around the corner from Lucky's and it was somewhat of a Friday night tradition to pick up a pizza and some of their amazing wings. The restaurant itself really isn't anything special, they have booths and a tv in there, but it's definitely a take out kind of place. Their food, however, is really good. I am not a huge wing fan, but I absolutely love the wings here. They are almost a bit crunchy and the sauce is unlike any that I have ever had before. The perfect kick, but not too spicy for my sensitive stomach. They have great lunch specials and dinner deals too, so stop in if you are craving some "real" pizza and not just the quick production pizza hut stuff.

Everyone at work always used to rave about Lifetime and my natural rebellious spirit always wanted to hate it because it seemed so trendy. After some prodding from a persistent co-worker and several unwanted pounds packed on, I thought, what the heck, why not?  I went on one of her guest passes and when I saw the over sized pool and salon on my walk in, I assumed my suspicions were true about the trendiness and figured it'd be full of barbie and ken dolls like most gyms I have been to in the past. To my surprise, there were people of all shapes and sizes. As she showed me around, I didn't notice anyone eyeing me and sizing me up, which is something that drives me nuts about gyms, or rather the people at gyms.   I used the full two week pass to attend several of the group classes they have including core and Pilates and I really enjoyed the classes and instructors. No matter what time I went, there were always cardio machines available because they have a ton. Total surprise since I have always had to wait at the 5 o'clock "rush hour" at other gyms.  I decided to look into the membership which is $50 a month. It is more expensive than other memberships and you can't just go to all of the other locations, but those are two thing I'm ok with sacrificing. I really enjoy working out here and actually feel comfortable, which is really important to me. I still really enjoy the classes and haven't had to wait for a machine yet. I also frequent the cafe they have downstairs and love it! The food is really good, all of the nutrition facts are right there on the menu board and they have daily specials, so it's affordable.   A few things I didn't love that were pretty gym standard in my experience include the free meeting with a personal trainer where they spend the time trying to get you to sign up for personal training and invest in an expensive heart monitor and testing. These things always make me feel super uncomfortable. I'm also not totally in love with the staff members I've encountered. Most are nice, but I feel like they are a bit snotty at the check in counter at times. And of course, the super cheap advertised start up fees had small print and were more than I expected.    All in all though, I'm really pleased with my choice to join this gym. I guess you can just call me one of the trendy kids now. ;)

I went here on Friday night and had an excellent time. Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive and the food was phenomenal. We got an order of wings and the firecracker spinach artichoke chicken (I think that's what it was called). If for nothing else, I will be returning to eat that again! They had a big open room wit pool tables that you can rent, so we played for a bit. Although I suck, it was still pretty fun and the tables were nice. After our meal, the manager came over t ask us how everything was and gave us a card for a free appetizer on our next visit.   This was the best food, service and overall great dining experience I have had in a while. I will definitely be back!

I have been getting my hair done here for 2+ years and I have never been happier with the way it looks. Chrissy is my stylist and in the time that I have been going there, she worked her way up to manager of the store. She is really awesome because I have tried so many thing with my hair and she is always there to give her gentle opinion if I am about to make a huge mistake or to help me try new things. She is very professional and always takes the extra time to make sure my hair turns out great. We also carry on conversation the entire time ( 1 1/2 hrs!) which makes getting my hair done one of my favorite things to do.  As far as the salon itself, it really isn't anyting special. Kind of small and nothing fancy about it. It is always clean and well kept though. They do have a good variety of product behind the counter though, which anyone there is willing to help give you info on.  I have seen a few other stylists doing hair there and they all seem friendly and the haircuts of their clients usually come out looking pretty nice.   The prices are really what got me here in the first place along with a recommendation. A hair cut is around $14, and I get layers, so that is really reasonable. I get two colors, partial highlights as well and my entire total is usually around $85.   Overall, I don't mind trading the fancy decor for personalized, friendly, and cost efficient service. I am sure I will be going to Chrissy for years to come!

If you enjoy being cut off after 4 beers in a period of 3 1/2 hours, when you brough a DD, I would definitely visit this bar!  I just moved down the street from here and thought that I could make this a cool hanng out. Myself and a few girlfriends went here tonight to have a few beers and a good time and here I am writing a review instead. We took a DD with us and had a few drinks. There were about ten people total in the bar, and we were having a good t ime with lots of laughs. When we ordered our 5th beer (which we had all decided would be our last before we headed home) the waitress told us that we had enough. We told her that our DD was sitting with us and she said that it didn't matter and that we were cut off.  Seriously? While we were sitting at  the bar, the owner came in and had his big ass dog roaming around  the bar. You are so strict as to cut us off, but fine with having a dog walking around which would be a clear health code violation.  I have never been so embarrassed and felt as if I as was singled out in my life. The bartender wad rude and if I was so drunk that it called for me being cut off, how could I sit here and write this review?  I don't mean to be biased, but I had a horrible experience and will NEVER be back to this bar and I would recommend that you don't visit either if you are looking to have any sort of an enjoyable evening.

I believe in second chances, so I decided to try out Chantilly's again last night. While my experience was far better than last time, I just still think this place lacks, well, a lot.  There were two patrons in the bar and only two more that entered in a two hour time period. Granted, it was Wednesday, but it's hard to imagine how this place can stay in business.   It was a bit awkward because there was no music playing, so I felt compelled to play something on the jukebox. Any new songs were two credits ($1) so that kind of sucked, luckily I'm a fan of 90's music...  The bartender (yes, the very same that cut me off previously) was actually really sweet this time, so that definitely warrants a star increase.  It's still the only bar that I know of that is cash only, which is pretty inconvenient.   It was a lot better this time, but this place is still boring and doesn't really have much to offer. I really wish that I could like it, but I'm still bitter and unimpressed.

Dos is what I like to call a "sure thing"  I say this because I know that I will always enjoy the food and always have a good time. I love the feel of Dos, the way everything is kind of everywhere and the outdoor atmosphere. While most people go for the cheap drinks and to be scene (intended spelling) I actually like Dos for the food and good service.  I love that they use black beans instead of the typical refried like most other mexican food joints. Don't get me wrong though, it's still a bar, and it's a fun place to start off a Friday night or grab lunch drinks.

I have only been here once, but I plan on going back. We did a a low key work get together here one Sunday morning and it was a great time. They have really fun drinks and amazing brunch food, not your typical pancakes and eggs! The atmosphere was cool too, very social. There are booths and pool tables perfect for mingling. A nice find in old town.

I went to Divinity this past Saturday to get my first tattoo and I was so pleased with my experience. The shop was really nice and clean and everyone that worked there was very friendly. Ryan did my tattoo and he did an amazing job! He did my sister's tattoo as well and they both came out looking phenomenal. I was pretty nervous because it was my first tattoo, but he was nice about the whole thing. I had a great first experince and I will definitely go back for any work I get done in the future!

I can't even begin to say how many poor customer service experiences I have had here.  We used to do lunches a few times a week at my old job and Zipps seemed to be one of the regular spots, although I always made a fuss. Rather than being stuck in the office and miss out on the lunch gossip, I always opted to go, and EVERY time, it was the same old story...this place is never too busy during lunch, but service is slower than the second coming. It would take 1.5 - 2 hours for the small group of us to make it through lunch. Not to mention that after consuming my first beverage, the glass would remain empty, my number one dining pet peeve.   I do have to say that I can't completely hate on Zipps because their food really is good. They have awesome nachos and sandwhiches. I have never been disappointed with the quality of my food. And when I was having a calorie splurge day, Zipp's pizookie was the perfect way to do it!   Zipps gets a 2 star rating from me, but if they get their service act together, we can negotiate a better score...

I was pre-warned that this is a dive bar, but still, this was low even for my standards. There wasn't much that I really cared for except for my cheap $3 mich ultra. The place is really small and it was packed so it was really difficult to move around. The bathroom was insanely small and crowded with a bunch of chicks primping (not that this place really called for any necessary primping).  I can get past all of the surface stuff, but the service is what really turned me off to this place. Although the bar was pretty full, there weren't many people actually sitting at the bar, so I sat down on a stool and waited about ten minutes to even be asked for my drink order. I get that can happen when people are busy, but the bartenders walked right past me and looked at me a few times, cash in hand. After I did get my first drink, getting the second was even trickier! After seeming complely invisible to the bartenders I was finally served by the barback that happened to be up there putting something away.  Everyone elses reviews seem to indicate this is a cool place, so maybe I just wasn't in the right frame of mind. Either way, waiting so long to be served is a big downfall at a bar in my book, so Coach House gets 2 stars for now. I'm not opposed to giving it another try though and hopefully my next experience will get a higher rating!

I enjoy shopping consignment stores for the deeply instilled (by my mother) need to find - and brag - about getting the absolute best deals imaginable. More importantly, I never seem to want to dress to the current fashion trends and regular retail locations never seem to fit my style. Both of these things are perfectly fulfilled by My Sister's Closet.  They have a huge variety of designer clothing, shoes, bags, sunglasses coats and all sorts of attire. Compared to other locations, this one definitely has a more high end feel, better selection and is very spacious.  I've found everything from amazing jeans to a coach handbag to a gorgeous dress for my work Christmas party. They have a ton to offer and I definitely recommend checking it out for the designer quality at the discount price.

I LOVE Green. I am not a Vegan or even a Vegetarian, but I do appreciate great food.  My first time here was great because I went with a group and got to try bites of a variety of items. The hummus is my fave. It's got  a bit of a spice which I love and comes with deep fried pita (sometimes a bit too greasy, but I can deal). The artichoke appetizer is delish, but not anything like a traditional, so I wouldn't expect that. The salads are really yummy, I can't remember which ones I've tried, so I can't specify which are best. And today, I tasted heaven in the form of a tater tot. They just introduced sweet potato puffs and they are incredible. I will be getting these as a side every time now! And then there's the tsoynami. Most incredible frozen treat ever. I get the betterfinger with no choco chips, add peanut butter and double chicostix (sp?) SOOOOOO good words can't describe.  I love it here so much that I make the trek from Ahwatukee to Scottsdale for lunch, salivating in anticipation, just to please my pallet a few times per month and it is worth every mile.   As mentioned in just about every review, the staff is incredibly friendly and always willing to make a recommendation if you ask. One time, when there was a mishap with my office's order that caused me to wait an extended period of time for pick up, I got a call upon returning to work from the manager with a personal apology. I can't recall another place EVER taking the time to do that. For this, I am forever loyal.  Reviewing this made me crave it all over again. I may have to go back for dinner. Don't judge me.

I wanted to try a new Mexican food place today so I stopped in and was quite disappointed. The food was mediocre at best, but the service was quite good. I ordered vegetable fajitas and there was minimal flavor. The guacamole was just a paste with no veggies and this is what really bummed me out. I loooove guac. The salsa was ok, but nothing special. Wishing I had just skipped this place altogether.

My boyfriend and I had a really exceptional dining experience here last night. We made reservations and were seated right away, sort of in the back, so it was quite private. Our server was fantastic and assisted in the selection of two incredible wines, although I can't seem to recall the names right now, but I'm sure the staff would be happy to make recommendations. For an appetizer, we ordered bruschetta and it was delicious! A much larger portion than we anticipated and would have been good for a group of 4.    Then came the meals and silence as we couldn't put our forks down! My bf got the voodoo penne and it's just freaking amazing. I had the butternut squash ravioli, one of my favorite dishes in general, and it was hands down the best I've ever had. A great mesh of flavors.   Our service was spot on and friendly, the ambiance was great and the food was incredible. I will definitely return on another splurge day!

This place has the absolute best egg salad sandwiches! It is super close to my work so I usually get it once or twice a week. The box lunch comes with your choice of sandwich, a side, a fresh cookie and a mint, so it is a great value. They bake the bread fresh and it is really amazing. Definitely stop in if you are in the area and in the mood for a tasty sandwich!

The first time I went here was as the guest of my cousin for her work X Mas party. She is a grade school teacher as were the rest of the attendees, so to say this was pretty low key is an understatement. It was a great time though and the food was pretty tasty. The staff was attentive and the atmosphere was really enjoyable. This positive experience, however, really set me up for disappointment when I decided to meet some friends here for a regular bar evening on Friday.   First off, I thought swingers bars were only the subject of crazy mishaps and investigations on CSI and Law and Order. Turns out, they really exist and this is it!  It was the bar's 10 year anniversary so there was free champagne, a live band (they were actually really good) and tons of 40+ year old cougars on the prowl. I spent most of my evening on the patio as to hopefully not catch anything but a draft of wind, if ya know what I mean. Unfortunately, after the third request to turn the heaters on, the waitress informed us that all but two heaters on the patio were broken. Guess they were just there for show or to create the illusion of warmth, like the fire pit that didn't actually work.   I was told by a fellow patron that this was a swingers bar at which point I thought he was making fun of all middle aged people on the dance floor bumpin and grindin (I still can't get these images out of my head). On my way to the bathroom though, this sentiment was confirmed. A very friendly and intoxicated woman walking in front of me pointed to a door and said "I have seen no less than 8 couple bang (she used another 4 letter word, but let's try to keep it clean here folks) in there". She then proceeded to tell me that Cocomo Joes's and her husband cheated on her after they frequented the bar for the last 5 years of their marriage when they were in an "open" relationship. I felt bad for a moment until she blurted out "all is forgiven now that I found my sugar daddy here". She wasn't kidding.  Although I got quite the kick out of the people watching, I can only pray that this isn't me in 20 years. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're into that sort of swinger thing...

I ended up here one random night after several drinks and had a great time! It was a Friday night and it wasn't too crowded which was nice. There was a good vibe going on and a room with a dance floor where I did my white girl dancing (not a pretty sight haha). There is a front little patio area that wasn't too loud so it was good for socializing with the group I was with. The plentiful menu of martinis was awesome! We all tried different kinds and swapped and I was pretty impressed with what I tried. The bartenders were friendly and it wasn't too long of a wait for a drink. All in all it was a good time, I'd go back with my not so straight friends again if another random evening presents itself!

Stopped in here today for the first time and so glad I did. we sat on the spacious patio and the weather was perfect. Our server, Nathan, came right out to take our order. We got the hot wings as an appetizer and they were delicious. Crispy and great flavor, but not very spicy at all. We then ordered the platter combo of pulled pork with mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. The mac was ahhhhmazing! The pork was also very good and I really liked the bbq sauce on it.   The food was all great and reasonably priced. Nathan was great and very attentive throughout our entire meal. The manager also popped out to check on us, which I always appreciate. We had an excellent dining experience, with plenty of leftovers to enjoy all over again later! I would definitely recommend going here for great bbq and plan to return soon!

While most people probably visit Sauce for one of the delicious thin crust pizzas or well-portioned flavorful salads, I go out of my way to visit for the mac n cheese!!! No joke, this stuff is amazing! Creamy, cheesy and perfectly complimented with the side of bread that comes along. Give it a try and I'm sure you won't be disappointed!!!

I used to go to Cafe Carumba a few times a month when I worked in Old Town and I loved it! The food has a unique flavor and the decor is pretty cool. I always get the sundried tomato basil quesadilla. Yumm! It's stuffed with cheese and peppers and it is sooo good. I've had a few other things there as well and have never been disappointed.  The service is always really good and quick (I have only been there for breakfast/lunch so I don't know about the dinner rush) One waiter always ends the meal by bringing your check and asking if you'd like to hear a joke or a riddle. Take the joke....it's pretty funny  =)  Only downside is that this place is very "scottsdale" if you know what I mean. But I guess that is part of the fun of it. Definitely stop in and check this place out if you get the chance.

I've been to Touch of Thai twice now and ordered the Sweet & Sour dish with crispy chicken and both times was super impressed. The sauce is REALLY good and the portion is well sized. I also tried the fried rice with tofu this time and was in absolute heaven!  The decor isn't too great, kind of just plain and the bathroom wasn't very impressive, but the quality of food and extremely friendly staff make this a 4 star kind of place in my book. Our waiter was incredibly friendly and helpful in making recommendations.   I will definitely continue to eat here when I'm looking for a Thai fix!!

This place is such a find. We had family friends that used to own a little cafe in the complex so my mom and I ventured over to check out A Second Look one day. Let me just say, this is not your typical consignment store. It reminds me more of a boutique of treasures. The place is super clean and well kept and they always have a really wide variety of items in the store.   I have found so many awesome things in here, I couldn't even begin to list them all. They have everything from paintings, to fancy outing attire, to cds...and even a little cafe in the back. I could spend hours in this store checking everything out. One of the best finds was some Ansel Adams framed photography. (I am a huge Ansel fan!!!)   Best part ,of course, is the steals you get!!! They have a pricing system based on how long an item has been in the store. Everything has a date on it and they have signs conveniently located all over the store that show you the dates of when the item will be reduced. I have picked up many things for 50% - 75% off.   This place is ideal if you are on a budget and looking to add some flare to your home decor or if you are just in the mood for browsing for a good deal!!

I wanted to write an update based on my recent find. I usually stop in here to look at the decor type stuff, but after a crazy hunt for a dress for my formal work X Mas party I recalled seeing dresses in here before and thought I'd give it a try.  I found the PERFECT dress for the party and it only cost $35! I received numerous compliments on it at the party and felt like the bell of the ball. So aside from my regular great finds, I have to recommend them for formal attire as well. Gosh, I love this place!

I am not the most experienced Thai food eater, but I have been on a Thai kick lately and Yupha has been the answer. I am in looooove with the fried rice. Great portion, amazzzing taste. Love at first bite!  I like to compliment it with the sweet and sour entree with tofu. I get it mild and it's plenty spicy for my taste. The sweet and sour is not like that of a Chinese restaurant, but I'm thinking I like it better. It's more like sweet and spice and that is A-OK with me. It is also a generous portion and includes a side of white rice which is delicious when drenched in the sauce.  The staff has always been incredibly nice and the service is usually pretty speedy. I like the setting of the dining area too, it's usually pretty quiet when I've been in there and it's a relaxing setting.  I would definitely recommend going here to anyone looking for some delicious Thai food!

This my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE restaurant!  I love to go to Valle Luna when I am craving some good Mexican food. It has even become somewhat of a family tradition as we go there for birthdays and family dinners.  While you look over the menu, you are served with hot tortilla chips and their special recipe salsa. You get unlimited chips and salsa, but make sure not to fill up on them before your meal like I always do!  I love to get the fajitas, they are the best in town. They serve a steamy hot skillet with your choice of pork, beef, chicken or a combo of all three, along with peppers, onions and tomatoes. There is also a side plate with all the "fixings" like sour cream, guac, cheese, refried beans and rice and of course, warm tortillas. You can ask for extra of any of these items if you'd like also, especially if you love cheese and sour cream as much as I do. It is a bit pricey, but there is plenty of food to go around for 2-3 people or take home for great left overs!  When I am craving something a bit smaller (and less costly) I love to get the Bandito Burros located on the appetizer menu. You get 8 mini deep fried burritos with guac and sour cream. I've shared this appetizer with friends a few times and everyone always seem to enjoy them as much as I do.   Parking can be somewhat of a pain if you go during their dinner rush times. The outside appearance is also nothing to be impressed by nor is the inside decor as it is a bit outdated. Nonetheless, the food and friendly service always keep me coming back!!!

My review here is based solely on happy hour because I have never really been at any other time. This bar is really close to my work so we frequent it for the after work to wind down from time to time.  I always have a really great time. I like the outdoor seating when the weather is nice, I like that they serve black beans on most of their items rather than refried, I like the cheap buckets of Pacifico during happy hour and I love that they have corn hole or bags or whatever other term people refer to it as.   The table service is always really great and the waitresses have always been friendly, I've never had a poor experience with the staff. Some of the people that go there are pretty big D Bags which is annoying, but since I'm usually with a group of co-workers, I really don't mind.  All in all, this isn't where I'd choose to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night, but I will definitely continue to stop in for happy hour on those days after work when I could really just use a drink!

This place is really yummy!   It is right across the street from work so I go here once or twice a week. They have really good breakfast burritos for around 3 bucks. They're pretty filling, so it is a great value. They also have good lunch burritos, also reasonably priced.  The staff is always REALLY friendly. I usually pick up to go and it is pretty quick. You wait a bit longer during lunch rush, but it's definitely worth the wait!

I ended up here on a Saturday afternoon because the place we were going for lunch was a long wait and walking back to the car we saw the sign, which worked out perfectly!  I had never been to a place like this before and the server was super helpful with suggestions. I had the avocado salad and it was amazing and really fresh. For dessert, we shared the sweet potato pudd'n with vanilla ice cream (at the servers suggestion) and it was absolutely delicious! I now find myself craving it from time to time.   I liked the atmosphere as there is a small dining area, perfect for a party of two. There is a very Jamaican feel to the decor and it complimented the menu nicely. I definitely intend to go back and try out some other sections from the menu and get some more of that pudd'n!

This is a great little wine bar, but a bit too classy for Mill IMO. I tried the white Sangria at the recommendation of some friends and it is fantastic. It has a super fresh fruity taste. I haven't tried a ton of Sangria, but I definitely would say this is the best I have had. We ordered some bruschetta and it was equally great. I tried both the pulled pork and the fresh mozzarella and can't decide which was better. Either way, I'd highly recommend trying one of their many bruschetta options if you stop in. I really wanted to try the other food, but I had a late lunch and just couldn't fit it. I plan on going back to try some of the other items on the menu that looked tempting.   I also liked that they had the option of table seating or areas to hang on couches. It gives it a cool vibe and I enjoyed the atmosphere. Our server was great, just the right amount of attentive. I'm looking forward to my next visit to check out the rest of the menu and enjoy the cool ambiance.

This place is so awesome!!! I have been to a few other massage places like massage envy and it doesn't even compare to Healing touch.  There is a hawaiin theme, not cheesy or anything, and they really go with it the whole time. From the time you walk in, you are immediately relaxed. There is calming Hawaiin music playing and they take you to a room to change into a comfy robe. Then you sit in the waiting room and they have snacks and juice and hot tea and relax until your therapist is ready.   My last massage was with Mome and she was really great. She asked questions and found out what areas I really needed work on and focused there. She was very thorough and very professional. I am a little uptight about getting massages, but i always feel so comfortable here.   After your massage, you have the option to go to the waterfall shower, which I would highly recommend. It is really neat and relaxing, a great way to finish your experience.  the owners and staff are all so nice and friendly and make you feel like it is "your'" relaxation place. I signed up for the membership after my very first time going and am very happy that I did! The membership is really affordable and you don't get discount service for the lower price.  Bottom line, check this place out and you will surely be satisfied!!

First of all, I think everyone should know that I am a giant sissy when it comes to scary stuff. I am the kind of person that screams at lame scary movies, jumps at loud noises and cowers at the site of the smallest of insects.  That being said, I think I am a credible source to say Fear Farm was LAME. If you can't scare someone like me, then something is wrong. I went with a friend the first friday night that it was open. The lines were so long and I felt like I was on a middle school field trip with all of the preteens running around. We went through one haunted house (there are 4 total) and left.  Knowing that it was not Fear Farm's fault that it had attracted so many teeny boppers, we held onto our passes and returned on a Thursday night when the kiddies would be tucked into bed. MUCH BETTER. The lines weren't too long and we made it through the other 3 in a reasonable time.   Unfortunately, the scare factor had not improved. I think I jumped once or twice the entire time and that was because there was a chainsaw next to my face, and as I mentioned, loud noises scare me!   Weirdest part was that I got hit on THREE times by the monsters!!! Apparently I attract the creepy or something? And one of the guys working there totally hounded me...I get that they are supposed to get in your face and scare you, but this guy took it to the extreme. Plus, I thought they weren't allowed to touch you. This dude wrapped his arms around me and wouldn't let me go!!! This went on for a couple of minuted before he finally backed off. It was so weird!!!   I came to be scared, not picked up on!!! Ugh!

As I'm sure a lot of females out there are, I am sort of a serial nail salon go-er.   When it's time for a new pedi, I simply look for the nearest shopping complex to what ever area I happen to be in and find something with the word "nails" in it. That is until I discovered Shea Nails. A friend recommended them one time and I was in the area so I stopped in. At first, it appeared to be like any other nail place I had been in, a rectangle shaped salon with nail desks and chairs lined up on the wall. This, however, was such a different and pleasant experience!!! All of the tools that they use were individually packaged, by far the most sterile salon I have been to. They were friendly and didn't just speak in another language the entire time. They spent plenty of time pampering me and my perfectly polished little toes were the happiest they have ever been!  Never again will I be a serial nail saloner!!!

This little place has an awesome vibe and they make a mean burger! I was in love with the chandeliers and the color scheme. I ordered a regular burger with a lettuce bun and it was delicious. The lettuce they used got super soggy though, so that was kind of a bummer. They offer an array of burger options, like kobe and bison, as well as a large selection of toppings.   They also serve Gelato which I just couldn't pass up! The pralines and cream was delicious! Our service was great, the gal was very friendly and attentive. It was a bit on the pricier side, but that certainly isn't surprising for this part of town. Overall, it was a great meal and I would definitely return again.

I wasn't really planning on a pedi today but I was in the area and saw a sign showing they do pedis fo $18 mon-wed and I couldn't pass up such a great deal. The salon was empty when I walked in and the decor is pretty outdated (fake plants and all) but the friendly gal told me to pick a color and take a seat, so I did. The color selection was a bit limited but I found a pretty purple color with sparkles and sat in the comfy massage chair. The gal that did my pedicure was absolutely fantastic!!! She spent plenty of time pampering me including an incredible and lengthy massage followed up with hot stones. She was meticulous when applying the color and I am extremely pleased with my experience here. I will certainly return!

I've driven by alexis about a hundred times and kept thinking I should stop in but never got the chance. Today was an errand day, so I thought it might be nice to fuel up first and alexis hit the spot. This will certainly be my new weekend breakfast spot.  I opted for the corned beef hash and it was prepared just the way I like it! The hasbrowns are sorta flaky and browned and super yummy. My bf got pancakes and they were fluffy and tasty. One of the best parts was that the little jelly holder had apple butter! Haven't had it ages - yummmm!   The portions were large, I only made it through half of my meal and my bf finished his, but just about had to undo the button on his pants hehe. The staff was very friendly and welcoming.   I'm giving this place 4 stars but its more like 4.5....it smelled funny when we walked in and we almost left, although I'm glad we didnt. It also took a bit to get the check. The decor is also far outdated, but charming in my opinion.  My own little gem in my hood, glad I stopped in and looking forward to my return!

This bar is in my hood and I really wanted to like it, but I just wasn't a big fan. I went on an evening when they had a comedian, but there weren't too many patrons at all.   We went a bit early to get appetizers and drinks and I honestly could have passed. We ordered an appetizer platter of sorts with wings, mozzarella sticks and mushrooms I think and I didn't care for the way it was cooked at all, very dry. I wasn't expecting five star dining, but even for a sports bar the food wasn't quite up to par. The service was off too. The gal was really nice but didn't seem to have a clue. Every drink we asked about or menu item, she had to keep asking someone else. Maybe she was just new but it seemed more like she really just didn't know what she was doing.   The patio area for smoking is a bit weird. It is in front of the bar and none of the chairs or outside furniture matched, it just looked kind of like someones back yard. Very odd.   In all honesty I wouldn't have stayed if I didn't go to see the comedian, who at least made the trip worth it. I do have to give props that they chose a good entertainer and I have heard the bands that play there are pretty good as well. Maybe I'll return for a live band performance and have a better experience.

I'm not a huge meat eater but my first bite of that tasty, juicy, scrumptious burger triggered me to attack the rest cave man carnivore style.  The burger was super fresh and you can put any of the fixins you want at no extra charge. I also ordered the fries which are natural cut and salted to perfection. They give you a generous portion, plenty to share. I'd never tried fries with malt vinegar but my lunch mate insisted and oh boy was it delish! Wayyyy better than ketchup.   The restaurant was well kept  and the staff was friendly. We sat outside because the weather was especially nice, but the seating wasn't so comfortable, so I'd probably opt for inside next time.   I will definitely be back next time I'm craving a fix for my meat eating side.

I wasn't expecting to be, but I was super impressed with my stay here. I booked a room for after Thunder from Down Under was hosted here so we could avoid driving after what was sure to be drunken evening.   The room was super nice and modern. The beds were ultra comfy, the room was spacious and well decorated. They have the cool coffee maker that allows for individual cups. The bathroom was large and had a waterfall shower (which I didn't get a chance to use, unfortunately) and a giant bathtub. The lighting in the bathroom wasn't so great for getting ready, but they have a close up make up mirror attached to the wall which was really nice except that I didn't want to see all my facial flaws that close!   The hotel itself was well kept and the staff was courteous. There are two pools although I didn't stay at either for an extended period of time. At the main pool, there were plenty of lounge chairs available and the pool was well sized. It would have been nice to have a few more umbrellas so I could move to the shade when my pastiness started burning, but oh well. There was also no attendant at the towel station when we went on Sunday which I thought was odd. The smaller pool was nicer in my opinion. Fewer lounge chairs but also fewer kids and there was a speaker playing music which was nice.   The casino is pretty decent, not my favorite in the valley, but still a good selection of slots, tables and poker for whatever tickles your fancy. They also host a 5:00 toast every evening in the main bar which was kind of cool and I enjoyed the complimentary margarita, yum!   I only ate in the Blue Coyote Cafe as it was the only place that offered a variety of Vegan selections for my sis and both times it was pretty good. There was a long wait for seating so we opted for the bar both times and it was a good choice. The bartenders were super friendly and chatted with us while we waited. I had the nachos which were delishhhh as well as the veggie sushi roll and the lo mein noodle bowl (I think that's what it was). The hummus was pretty bland though, so I'd advise skipping that. The service was prompt and the restaurant, from what I could see from the bar, was well maintained.   After the show, we went to the night club upstairs and it wasn't really anything special. There is one bar and a big open section for dancing and such with a few big open spaces off to the left. The patio was super small, so smoking was really inconvenient and there were only two stalls in the ladies room which made for a painfully long wait.   Although I enjoyed almost every aspect of my stay, I do have one major complaint...parking is in the garage and the entrance to the hotel (which was hard to locate) is across the casino, so we had to drag our bags by many onlookers which was not fun considering the amount of clothing I packed...  So after my extremely long winded review, I'll recap short and sweet by saying that this was well worth the $109 I paid and we had an amazing time. I would return for sure.

I have been getting shellac on my nails for the past few months at a sub-par nail salon and I just had to find a new place. I googled shellac and Kashmir popped up as it's close to home. I called yesterday and the owner answered on the second ring. I was worried I wouldn't be able to get an appointment same day since it was already 4PM, but she got me in at 5.  When I arrived, I was surprised at the decor. It's super cool and fun and girly and I felt welcomed right from the get go. My nail tech was Tabby and she was a total doll. We chatted the whole time and I enjoyed my conversation with her. I intended to get shellac, but told her my only gripe was that my nails still crack on the sides, so I have a hard time growing them out. She recommended the rockstar mani instead and I'm so glad she did. They have a ton of fun sparkles that they add to gel for a thick, awesome looking finish. I don't foresee these breaking anytime soon, yay! She also explained to me that they use a probiotic (I think that's what it was) instead of primer as it's better for your nails and doesn't cause allergic reactions that primer sometimes does. She also said they never take one of those electric drill things to natural nails as some places do because they never want to damage your natural nail. I was impressed with her knowledge and the care they seem to take for their art.  My nails turned out amazing, I absolutely love them! They are a soft sparkly pink that is fun but not too dramatic.I've already had compliments galore on how cute they are. Oh and an added bonus, they were only $25! Cheaper than shellac and acrylics!  I fully intend to go back and try out the pedi despite  the negative reviews. All three gals working were super sweet and welcoming and I just felt like I was hanging out in a living room with my girlfriends chatting and painting nails. I'm excited for my next return.  4 stars for now since I haven't tried the pedi or seen the process for removal of the rockstar gel nails, but if  next time is anything like this experience, I will be making this my regular pampering destination for my nails and toesies!

On my way to my first Pure Barre class, I was talking about how I have yet to find a gym or exercise program that I actually enjoyed, therefore I never stick with it. After one class, my workout prayers had been answered!  Pure Barre is nitty gritty kick your butt for an hour, but leave feeling oh so good. The exercises target specific muscle groups and work them until you are shaking and think you just can't give anymore, but the amazing instructors time their motivation perfectly and make you push just a little bit harder.   Each class I feel like I am able to get the technique down better and better and am able to get more out of the hour. After three or four classes I was feeling more flexible, toned and motivated. They say results show after just ten classes, but after going about 5 or 6 times I am already seeing the huge benefits.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to really get their body in shape, but be prepared to push yourself, give it your all and feel the burn because this program certainly isn't for the faint of heart!

I wrote a review on another location, so I won't start all over, but I do have to comment on this particular location.  The burger is amazing. Every time I eat here, it is literally the best burger I've ever had. The quality of the meat and ingredients is just sooo darn good. So much better than In N Out Burger, but the same concept.  This location is close to work, so we go here a few times a month. I love love love their easy online ordering and the fact that my order is correct every time. The staff is friendly every time I've picked it up and the wait is minimal with the pre-ordering.  I don't know what else to say, but I love this place and I will be back again and again and again....

I have had a membership at Hawaiian Experience Spa for about 3 ish years at their first location in Scottsdale. I love going but don't always find the times since it's a bit of a drive, so when I heard they were opening a Chandler location, I was ecstatic!  I thought the decor of the first location was amazing, but they have truly outdone themselves here. Everything is so beautiful and I love the waterfall showers (yes, two!), so amazing. The lounge where you wait prior to your treatment overlooks a little lake and is the perfect way to get you in a relaxed mood.   I've seen Brian twice for massages now and I am so impressed with his knowledge and ability to work out those tough spots in my neck. I feel like they always select their therapists so carefully and offer the best of the best on their staff.  Congrats to Cathy and Steve on a second location! Thank you for continuing to offer affordable memberships and always providing me with a relaxing experience and making me feel so comfortable.  If you haven't had a chance to visit the spa, you are REALLY missing out!

I was looking for something close to my office for lunch today and decided to try The Phoenix Cheesesteak Co out based on the great reviews. The reviews don't lie folks, this place was delicious!   I called ahead for pickup which was about a 20 minute wait right at noon, not bad at all. It was a bit hidden next to the convenience store, but I was able to find it ok. Hopefully they will put more signage out so people know it's there and want to stop in. The dining area inside is small but nice - probably not a good idea for a group of more than 4. The staff was very friendly and greeted me right away.   Now for the meat of the review - the cheesesteak!  (lame joke, I know ;)  ) I went for the not so philly as I prefer the classic philly taste. It wasn't like any I've ever had before, I'd say it's a spiced up version. The cheese sauce has a bit of a spice to it. The bread was delicious - the prefect softness to crunch ratio.  The steak is cut into large trunks rather than sliced. I think I prefer sliced, but this was good as well. All around, a great sammich. and the fries? oh the fries are some of the best I've ever had. Amazing. Good portion for sharing, or keeping all to yourself because they are too good to share.  So why not 5 stars you say? I think I was expecting more of a "traditional" philly taste even though their website and everything about them says it's not. My guess is that one of the cheesesteaks on the menu with the southwest flair would be a better choice since that is what they are aiming for. I'm definitely going to try this again and go for another option and then probably update this to a 5.

Went here last week for a work lunch and got to try quite a few items. I was extremely impressed and can't wait to go back. I can't remember the name of the pizza, but it had jalapeno cream cheese, bacon and avocado and it was freakin amazing!!! I also tried a bite of the vaquero burger which is quite hearty and also very tasty. Get the mac n cheese, just do it. I had the truffle mac and it was to die for. Bruchetta was awesome too.   Cool decor with swanky fun chairs. The staff was on point and I was very happy with the service. Check it out!!

I had previously only experienced Yoga by going to classes offered at my gym, so this was my first experience at a dedicated studio and with hot Yoga. I feel like I had been completely missing out on the mental benefits yoga offers by attending at a gym! The combination of the heat and excellent verbal guidance offered by the instructors really allows you to challenge yourself mentally and physically. They were offering a special, 2 weeks for $20 and I went to 5 classes during that time. After just those few classes, I noticed a huge difference in my flexibility and toning.   Here are some tips for first-timers that I learned during my experience:  Bring plenty of water. I usually went through about 1 1/2-2 bottles of water. I froze my second bottle of water so it stayed cold through the full 80 minute class.  They can be a bit pricey, but purchasing an actual hot Yoga towel is something I would really recommend. They have grip on the bottom and don't slide around like a regular towel. I found one on Amazon for around $20, but they can go up to as much as $75.  Wear light-weight clothing. I was a bit uncomfortable at my first class and wore more clothes than I wish I would have. By my 3rd class I was wearing a sports bra and shorts because you sweat SO much. No one is there to judge, so wear clothes you are comfortable in, but I definitely wouldn't recommend pants or sleeves until your body acclimates to the heat.   Show up early. When you first start going, the instructor will advise you to setup close to the doors so you get fresh air throughout the class when the doors are opened. These spots fill up quickly, so make sure you get there early enough to get one. Not sure I would have made it through my first 3 classes without that cool draft! =)  Unfortunately, it is out of my budget to keep attending classes as they are pretty pricey (they are comparable to other hot yoga studios I have researched though) but if you can afford it, I would really recommend going here. I very much enjoyed it and saw tons of benefits after such a short period of time!

I just discovered this place on Sunday and made my third trip back today, Wednesday!   I have tried the Park Ave Cobb, Herban Cowboy and the Wholey Moley salad and all three have been amazing! The portions are very large and the quality of ingredients is really impressive. They also make their own dressings which have been delicious. It is a bit more money than I would typically spend on lunch, but I feel genuinely full and think you are definitely getting what you pay for here. I've also tried a juice and two smoothies and really enjoyed all three. The fruit punch smoothie was my favorite so far.   Aside from the incredible food, I really appreciate of the genuine staff. Every time I've come in, they are willing to offer suggestions and seem to just have a really good, positive vibe. On my first visit, they had brewed a new raspberry tea and asked my opinion. I raved about it and they ended up bringing me a free tea to go. How cool is that?!?!   Everything about this place just makes me feel better. I'm really happy to have found this awesome gem!
