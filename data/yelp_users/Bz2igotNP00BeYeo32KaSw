So, I ate there on Wednesday and it is now Friday.  I have not had solid food or been able to keep anything down since I went there.  In an area that has so many great places don't go there.  Keep driving east on Camelback and hit one of the many other restaurants on that street.

We were hungry for Mexican food and found this place on Yelp.  It quite possibly was the best Mexican place we have been to in AZ

I'm not sure why people come here anymore. Oh sure, back in the day this place was amazing. Now, you can taste the prepackaged microwave-ness. I had the Kobe burger, 12.50 for a tasteless burger. My wife had the the pear and endive salad. There were no pears. The service was slow. The food was not at temperature. Soda machine was broken.

I love this Target! Everyone is so friendly and they always have what I need. The food is always fresh and the cashiers are always quick.

Not sure why there are such bad reviews for this place.  I have had my oil changed here for the past 4 years.  I have never had a problem and they are always nice.

The food is nothing spectacular. The only reason to go is because kids eat free on tuesday.

Best food I have had outside of Louisiana. I took my mom here on her last visit. That was all she wanted the next two days she was here.

This place was great! Our waiter Nick was very attentive. The scallops, lobster and sushi were excellent. We will definitely be back!

The food was bland. I think they poisoned me too. If you value your life don't go here.

Put mayo on my burger after I asked for none. How hard is it to not do something?

Just enjoyed some of their brisket at the BBQ and beer fest. They were the best out of everyone.

I have been going to discount tire for about twenty years and have always had excellent service. Unfortunately, on one visit to this location my service was not what it should have been. I reached out to discount to tell them about my less than excellent service. I was quickly contacted by Tony the store manager. Tony and Gregg have gone out of their way to solve my issues. I am always going to be a loyal customer.

The only good thing about this place was the beer selection. The food is flavorless. The service sucks. With a little bit of leadership and a decent chef this place would always be packed. Jacob the waiter said to ask for him next time. Don't ask for Jacob! He was horrible. He took my wife's beer before she was done. Jacob, smoke less pot it will get you farther in life.

Well...I'm not sure why we went back here. The beer selection has dwindled. The service was slow. We didn't get food this time. We learned from our last visit. Our night ended early when old drunk people started singing karaoke. I would not recommend going here any night especially on a Friday night.

Should be called slowmed. I have never waited so long for an urgent care. There is no urgency in their ability to see patients. You are better off going to a witch doctor because if you are really sick you will die in the waiting room.

I used to come here all the time. The owner and his wife were always there and very nice. However, the new staff that they have hired are rude and unknowable. I will not be back.

I feel bad for my previous review. I shouldn't have based my review from the experience of one bad employee. Everyone else is always so nice here. The owner and all of his employees always take the time to talk to you and help you with what you need. I was in on Friday and the girls were very nice and gave me tips to keep my baguette fresh for Mother's Day. They even wrapped it in cello for me. The food has always remained great. If you are in the area you should support this business. It is people like this that keep food fresh, exciting, and most importantly non-corporate.

I've used LUX Rides three times so far. Twice for the airport and once for a concert. Johnny and his team are amazing. They were always early, professional, and safe. Plus, when Johnny took us to the concert he made us drinks! Simply amazing! I will always use LUX rides.

It was not as good as I wanted it to be. I know that Mexican food is regional and you can get many variations of a single item. However, the tortilla my burrito was wrapped in was crunchy, the meat was over seasoned, and there was too much lettuce in the burrito. The red salsa was good. The service was good.

How can you go wrong with this place? One of the last few good chain restaurants. Go with the combo and the cheese fries. You will not be disappointed.
