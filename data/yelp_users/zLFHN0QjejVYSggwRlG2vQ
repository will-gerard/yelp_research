Good prices.  Friendly service.  A fast examination of your mobile phone.  This was the THIRD place I went...to see about getting my phone fixed.  The first one said it would be $70 and 3-5 days.  The second place said they did not do what I needed done...but they told me about Sun Cellular...they told me to see Dan.  They had an option to try and repair my current broken piece...which was not even an option with the first place.  So that is great.

So many great items!  Be sure and see Chris or Tanner!  They know their stuff.

Had lunch there today. Waited for about 5 minutes for the host. Then walked to the bar area looking for someone to seat us...no bartender.  After all that I was ready to never come back.  But the trip was saved by the service of our server.  I wish I could remember her name!

Upon first arrival we noticed Brooklyn and her magnificent hair!  Our server Michael was handsome and polite.  We started off with the caso dip and chips.  SO very delicious.

Had the gluten free cheese pizza.  It was wonderful.  I really did not care for the seating.  I love a booth...hate table seating.  They had 2 booths.  There was only 2 other couples in the whole place....neither group in a booth.  So I requested 1 of the 2 booths....and I was told no.  The hostess/waitress said she would "get into trouble" if she sat us there.  Really!  Because they were SO busy!

Ashley was awesome!  The gluten free pizza was terrific as always.  First time having the Pimento Dip...it is a welcome change from the old salsa.

Very disappointed right now.  Popped in on my lunch break and their cafe is CLOSED!   Do they need to hire more people or what? The girl with glasses and walkie talkie did not offer any explanation.

Boooooooo.  This Target does not seem to know how to "cross train" their employees.  This is now the 2nd time this month that their snack bar has been closed super early.

First off there was only a couple registers open, everyone of them with a line 5 yards long.  I finally pick one that does not seem that bad.  Well the man that was being rang up was a member of this stores management...just standing there taking his sweet time chatting up the cashier.

So I went out with my mates the other night. Someone had to much to drink and lost it all over the passenger side of my new 2014! It was a nasty shade of red.  Finally after letting it bake in the Arizona heat for a couple days I took it in for a cleaning.  The guys at Super Star got it out in a snap.

I am a big fan of the Target snack bar.  I always get the pizza hut sticks combo.  However, I am not a fan of employees chit- chatting in the back while there are no napkins & dirty tables. The napkin situation was fixed...after I told them they were out.  But the tables remaind dirty during my visit. (I had to clean mine before sitting down.)

This place has 2 levels to it. They were so busy we had to wait 20 minutes for a table...yet I don't think the second floor was even open.  But Katliyn our server was wonderful. We sat in what looked like a speed boat. The seats were a little dirty upon arrival.  We had perfect margaritas & the chocolate hurricane.

Other then looking like the home of a horder....the cashier was rude & acted like the problem with the credit/debit card reader was my fault.  On the positive side..it is open 24 hours & attached to an "okay" mall.

The margaritas where LARGE and tasty.  The salsa was very fresh but I had expected more kick to it...since we were at a Mexican restaurant.  We also ordered the cilantro lime chicken wings.  A dozen for 9.99.  With tip, the order of wings & 4 margaritas we paid about $55 total.  So not toooo bad.  This was another one of those places where no one wears a name tag. We were unaware of our servers name until the check came. (the other being LGO)
