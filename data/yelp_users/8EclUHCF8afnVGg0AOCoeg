Hands down the best Mexican restaurant in the East Valley. Tacos, Enchiladas, cheese crisp, menudo, albongidas, pozole, etc. It's the best! I've been coming for over 25 years and I've never been disappointed. The chips and salsa and hot sauce is the best too.

I ordered a carne asada burrito and a beef taco here around 3pm on a weekday. The beef taco was pretty good, the cheese was fresh and the lettuce tasted clean.   However, the carne asada burrito was not good, I tried covering it up with salsa,  still not good. The steak was burnt looking, maybe it had been sitting for awhile. I don't recommend the steak for anything.  The new breakfast burrito is tasty as long as they do not burn the eggs. This place is hit or miss.

The number 18 tohm yan soup is the best around for soup and noodle lovers. Thai tea is great too, but it is powerful. Medium to hot spicy will make you sweat, they don't joke around when it comes to spicy here.

Paid $10 for an egg, potato, and green chile beef burrito, enchilada style red, with a fountain drink. My meal was so-so,  I enjoyed the spiciness of the green chile.   The customer service was not good. The girl behind the counter was on the phone, hung up, and didn't acknowledge me for about 2 minutes while she input a phone order. When my meal came out she must have whispered my order number because my food was just sitting there, waiting for me. It was clean inside.  Bottom line: There are better Mexican food options within a five mile radius. Rositas's, Burrito Express, Elmers, Amado's, Cafe Rio, etc. Go a little further and try Los Taquitos or Burrito Company. I won't be back to Espo's.

This place is great! They have a two options for sizes and prices are just right. They selections of ingredients tasted fresh, the sauce was tasty, and I even had the option for how long I wanted to cook my pizza. After the pie comes out they have finishers that you can add on.  The customer service was great, we came in Friday night about 10:30 and we were the first ones in before a late night rush hit. Very friendly staff.  They have some tasty craft beers on tap and wine if you desire. Also, shakes and root beer floats are available. I will try out the salads next time too. Definitely a great option to choose from of the three pizza on demand restaurants in the area.
