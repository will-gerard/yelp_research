Touch of Thai used to have a location in old town Scottsdale. I are their pad thai, no joke at least twice a week. I loved their pad thai so much and frequented the place to the point where the owner John knew my name and order. Unfortunately it closed down and just kept their second location open. I now drive 35 minutes to dine here. I wish they would once more open a location in Tempe or Scottsdale. It's so authentic delicious and satisfying I crave it all the time. Highly recommend. However the Scottsdale location was much cleaner than this one. Still trying to find something local and comparable. Thai house is good but just not as good. Love Touch of Thai.

Best turkish food in Arizona that I have tries yet. I get the chicken plate and love it with the yellow rice. The owner is incredibly welcoming and love that they are always playing soccer matches on tv. They also have excellent baklava for dessert. Authentic turkish food. Highly recommend if you are looking to leave a place with a full belly and satisfied.

I am so sick after eating here today. The plates and silverware were dirty. I tried to ignore it and just eat the food. The tomatoes were brown. I asked our server if they were meant to be that color and she replied surely yes. It is now 5 hours later and I am puking my meal up and have no appetite.  My boyfriend is just as sick and we will never go back.

Yogurtology is the best hot spot for yogurt in Scottsdale. Flan is one of my favorite flavors or even just tart! Once you try it you will be hooked! Friendly staff now knows me by name. I dream about yogurtology and when I wake up I go get it!

I followed Annie from pucci down the elevator to the swanky Green Room, and I have never looked back. I adore this place and all it has to offer, including it's green friendly products and it's chic stylists. Highly recommended. Anyone who can tame my mane can conquer any hair task at hand. So take the elevator down to the basement of the Green Room and discover Scottsdale's most hip salon, you won't be sorry. Annie changed not only my hair but my life!

Palm Beach Tan used to be Darque Tan. Nothing has changed besides the name. And this is a good thing. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the beds, lotions, and monthly packages. Best tanning salon in Scottsdale. I would recommend anyone looking for a spa like atmosphere and high quality beds and spray tans to use Palm Beach Tan. They have all sorts of lotions to buy and usually a deal to accompany. The only thing that sucks is that I got burnt the first time I tanned. My fault because I negotiated with the rep to do 5 min instead of 4min. I am as a red as a lobster. Next time I will be more careful but cannot wait to get back! Like I said best tanning salon in Scottsdale and I have tried a few.

I give 5 stars but they don't always have my favorite flavor yogurt available. However even without my favorite froyo Swirls is the best frozen yogurt and ice cream place in Scottsdale. The staff is friendly and the rewards program is a great advantage. The owner whom I have met takes great pride in his store and is very personable. The store even had yogurt for your dog and a bowl of cold water for them to drink from if you decide to enjoy your yogurt outside. Swirls used to be yogurtology but I guess they changed their name, however as long as they serve fantastic yogurt I don't care what they name it. I'm in.
