It's okay.  Nothing special. I think their food is too small and not high quality enough for the prices they charge.  I always leave hungry.   This is my second meal at this place, and perhaps my last.   I was just at a wine dinner tonight.  $65 for four courses and four wines.  Courses were tiny.  I mean... imagine about 4 cherry tomatoes cut in half with some pepper on top for one of the courses.  Entree was fine if you want a literally extra rare filet wrapped in raw bacon.  I like medium rare (they didn't even ask us what temperature we wanted the beef) but this was barely browned on the outside, and completely raw inside.  They redid it, but still... what the...  The dinner for that dinner was a melting chocolate and raspberry desert that was to die for.  Almost saved the meal.  For $100 per person for a wine dinner, pre-dinner cocktail, small cheese plate for four, and tip included... I can do better.  Good company, but that was the best part of the evening.  I feel after eating at this place, every time, like I was mugged.  I understand the owner has to make a buck, but...

What a disappointment!  After reading these reviews and even hearing good (not great) reviews for a couple family members, we headed her this Sunday.  First off, I thought the service was mediocre to poor.  Not friendly, no smiles, and they never came back to the table except to take the order and deliver the food.  No water, no extra chips for the table of four, nothing.  My wife tried the Huevos Rancheros, which were okay, not terrific.  Congealed eggs versus over easy, but a big tortilla.  $6-7 bucks, so didn't break the bank.  I had the two enchiladas and shredded taco plate, about $10.  Overpriced, greasy, and just not very good.  Gut bomb was more like it.  My daughter had two shredded beef tacos for $4, filling.  My son had a $4 or so bean an cheese burrito, again just okay.  Re-fried beans were paste, and more lard than beans it tasted like.  Rice was good, not great.  Anyway, not even in the top 1/2 of mexican restaurants I've been to.  Definitely not in the top 3-4 like many reviews seem to indicate.   I live downtown, so only about 5 min from here.  I really wanted this to become my favorite new place.    But when a place is in a just okay neighborhood, dirt driveway, and mediocre to poor interior, man, their food and service needs to shine.  And they just don't.  I won't be back.    By the way, If anyone wants to know my favorite Mexican owned and operated, not ritzy but excellent food place in Phoenix, head to Las Glorias south of Northern on 19th Avenue.  Better value, better food, better decor, and way better service.

Wow!  Makes Denny's like like it deserves 5 stars.  Maybe I'm a food snob, but this was some of the worst breakfast food I've ever had.  I ordered an Eggs Benedict, and the sauce over it was frankly inedible.    My wife's special scramble was equally bad.  My 7 year old son did like his kid's meal.  This place has two things going for it:  an incredible nostalgic setting/rooms, and good to great service.  Both of those are 5 stars.  But if the food is terrible... it's hard to outweigh them.  It really was a soft underhanded pitch I made to them... all they had to do was deliver food in the ballpark of Denny's and I would have been happy as a clam.    But they didn't, and I won't be back.  Damn shame.

Always a great dining experience.  The filet doesn't get too much better.  Sides are tasty.  Salads and soups good.  It's a power diner place... red tie and jacket the norm, though not required.  Lively service staff, less romantic steakhouse than business place.  Not cheap, but you leave full of great beef.  One of my top 3 steakhouses in Phoenix.    And by the way, it's the best value on the entire Restaurant Week list.  I make it there every time, even while changing up the other restaurants.  And it's one of the ones I come back to to even when no special, because the food is very good.  This is probably the place I'd take an extra special client to if he flew into town.  Wish they had a daily happy hour.

Disappointing.  Prices slightly higher than the quality of the food and dining experience should dictate.  Food wasn't terrible, but not good or great.  Food below was for two adults and two smaller children.  Had the vegetarian Appetizer ($11).  It had two sauces, a small stack of pita corners, three fried balls (best part), and two HOT grape leaves (they weren't bad hot, just always had them cold before).  Just okay.  My wife and I love hummus usually, but neither of us cared to finish this.  My wife and I both really wanted lamb for the main course.  I mean, that's what Greek is all about.  But when we tried to order, we discovered they were all out.  Strange.  I probably would have changed restaurants but we'd already ordered appetizers and drinks at that point.  But that's okay.  Restaurants run out of things.  My wife tried a Gyro meat platter $11, and I tried chicken souvlaki $12.  My chicken was low quality chicken, fatty, and kind of nasty.  Two tiny skewers.   Probably $.75 worth of chicken.  Rice was mushy, and I couldn't stomach more than a bite or two.  Salad was decent, but just a greek salad.  Ordered a couple glasses of wine, which were warm and tasted like they were turning.  Should have sent them back but didn't.  Ordered the Baklava desert.  It was like a 2" square type of piece, tasted like I could have bought it next door at Trader Joes.  I expected better/more that I could at least offer four bites to the four people at the table.  Damage, $55 bill plus tax and gratuity.    Honestly, I wouldn't have paid $20 for it if I could have done it again.  If you go here, get a cheap sandwich or a salad.  They look decent and fairly priced.  This is probably a good to great lunch spot for a quick bite.  Just don't go here and  expect a nice big meal.  Myself, I doubt I'll be back.  If I do, I'll come back for a quick lunch and order a large greek salad topped with something ($12).  Just too many amazing dining opportunities in Phoenix.

Walking through the door to Avanti's is like time-warping back to 1970's Phoenix's top Itallian restaurant.  Looking more like a disco studio than today's refined simple modern standard for restaurants, it's a time warp.  And all the staff evidentily were there on the opening day in 1970 as well, but that isn't a bad thing.  They have a very defined "script" they follow of an old school Itallian restaurant, and do a good job of it.  After being scolded for trying to take the napkin to my lap while my wife's was unfolded by the waiter, I decided to go with it.  We did the $59 4 course prix fixe menu.  Ask for it if it isn't offered.   All the food was good, most of it ranging from excellent to amazing.    I ordered the ceasar salad, while my wife ordered the caprese salad.  The ceasar salad was excellent, and while dressing was heavy, it was so dang good I ate every last bit of green.  The caprese salad was different than most, with no vinegar, and over a pile of greens that looked like basil but didn't taste the same.  My wife liked it, but prefers vinegar.  Next I had egglant parmesan, which was a nice small portion and very tasty.  It wasn't fried, which was interesting, and had a cream base to it.   Extremely good.  My wife had the pasta trio, which was outstanding, because it's clearly homemade.  I mean, melt in your mouth pasta.  Not enough to share, but perfect for a pasta course for one.  Next came the entrees.  I had been tipped off that any fish that came with parmesan encrusted, was MUST TRY.  Mark these words.  You will not go wrong with the parmesan encrusted fish, even if you aren't a huge fish fan.  I ordered the Sea Bass, as I generally prefer that to the Paresan encrusted option, Salmon.  My sea bass was just okay, but the lemon butter sauce with capers and artichokes was outstanding, and so made up for it almost.  But my wife's salmon was a thing of beauty.  I mean, perhaps the best salmon I've ever had.  And that's saying a lot.  Lemon butter sauce was even better, parmesan was terrific, and I found myself stealing 1/3 of her dish because I couldn't stop myself.  And I NEVER do that.  So if you take away nothing from this review, if they offer some fish parmesan encrusted, go for it and don't look back.  Lastly, was desert.  I had the recommended creme brulee, and my wife had the cannolis.  The canoli was good, maybe very good.  No complaints.  My creme brulee was just okay.  It has less of a custard consistency than I was used to, and had very little burnt sugar top, which is really important for the experience of creme brulee.  Had the requisite blue berries.  So that was it.  $65 for two, as we only had water since we started a bit early.  Well worth the price, no doubt about it.  So if you want to go to a restaurant with outstanding food, see a glimpse of what dining ina  1970's restaurant was really like, and be surrounded MOSTLY by people in various stages of retirement, I highly recommend Avanti.  I wish I tried more of their fresh pasta.  If I was going back, I would probably share a pasta dish with my wife, each have the permasan encrusted fish of the day, and skip desert.    Good luck and here's to making it back out of the 70's time warp!

We returned recently and tried their pasta course prix fixe meal.  It was supposedly 5 courses (I was thinking tasting menu like, not expecting huge portions), but they served it as 3 courses (salad, main, dessert) and the pasta was obviously premade and just glopped on the plate, one big spoonfool to each corner.  The only pasta that rose to the "good" level was the gnocchi.  One tasted like vegetable stroganoff and was just nasty.  Ceasar salad had way too much dressing and tasted pre-made (kind of limp and drowning), the pasta as a whole frankly tasted like crap, and the dessert could have fit on a tablespoon.  Furthermore, our server seemed rude since we weren't dropping $150 on dinner.  We made no complaints as it seemed like one of those heavy handed places where the blame would clearly be placed on the patron, so we didn't bother.  Just smiled weakly and paid the bill.  It was a big two star step down from our first experience, where I was probably generous as it was with 4 stars.    Frankly, I'll take my business elsewhere with the many amazing Italian restaurants around the valley.  Leave this restaurant to the Assisted Living crowd that spare no expense for frankly mediocre food.  However, IF you have to go here (coupon, invited by another, etc.), stick to the following:  Order the parmesan encrusted fish (you can't go really wrong with that), and if you want a pasta course, stick to the gnocchi.  And pass on dessert and salad course unless you like a ton of dressing.

Exceptionally Mediocre with A Side Of Highway Robbery  My wife and I went here for midweek dinner.   First time.  Nothing to look at on outside.  Valet charges $2... okay.  Either let people park their own cars or offer free valet like most decent restaurants.  Inside, it's like an older, dated, run down french restaurant.  Tables were not exceptionally comfortable, were close together.  Wait staff was just okay.  Not formal enough, nor timely.  Not unfriendly, but not friendly either really.    I ordered the Lobster Bisque ($8) while my wife ordered the Smoked Salmon Quesadilla ($11).  Bisque was rich, savory, but a small portion   Not upsettingly small, but small.  The quesadilla was perhaps the standout of the evening, but just a simple cheese quesadilla (and no longer hot when it arrived), covered with cream sauce, and then overlayed with common smoked salmon.  It was unusual as well as tasty, and the portion was a nice size.   It was the only thing I would order again.   For the main course, I had the boar ($36).  My wife had the three fish entree ($32).    My boar was medium rare, but it was about 2.5 ounces of meat with a few veggies and about a 1/2 cup of common mashed potatoes.  The meat was good, don't get me wrong, and drenched in a pool of spicy sauce.  The sauce was the only thing great about the entree.  I was done and licking my chops and eying the bread bowl to see if I could get filled in no time, given the quantity of food.  My wife had the three fresh.  To their credit, they did seem like fresh fish, and were properly cooked.  She thought it was okay.  I asked her for a comparison to our "baseline" fish restaurant, Roy's, with it's predictably good fish, and she answered that it was "nowhere near as good."  The bread bowl was grilled bread you could get at Safeway, and butter croissants that tasted surprisingly like the breakfast toaster pastries I had in the 80's as a kid.  We were not impressed.  If the entrees had been $20, I would have given this an extra couple stars probably.  But at $36, I expect to be "wowed".    And I surely wasn't.  The clientele was mostly 50-80 year olds.   Clearly, some people had been coming here for special occasions for the last few decades, and had to no problem with the food or prices.     But this restaurant struck me as a chef/owner that was milking a reputation that was earned long ago, laughing every week on the way to the bank.  My bill was $90 before tip.  I was still hungry.   And honestly, I wouldn't have paid $45 for it.  I surely won't be back.  And I can't in good faith recommend it to you.  Dine at your own risk.

I know this place is a Phoenix institution.  And it is quite nice inside compared to many Chinese restaurants.  I was invited to lunch here by a colleague who had dined here many times in the past.  I felt the lunch menu was perhaps a bit overpriced, given the quantity and quality of food.  i ordered the kung pao shrimp ($8.25), which was a spicy dish, but ordered it HOT.  It came so mild I might as well have ordered shrimp in lobster sauce, with some peanuts thrown in.   There were about 10 peanuts, a 1/2 cup of sauteed green onions, and about 4 medium sized shrimp, to go with fried rice that had nothing in it and an egg roll the size of my thumb.  It WAS nice it came with hot tea.  Was it outrageously priced?  Absolutely not.  Would I eat here again if someone invited me?  Of course.  But if it's my choice, there are much better Chinese restaurants to be found.

I don't usually write bad reviews, but this was perhaps the worst chinese food I've ever eaten.  I wanted to LOVE this place, as it's 4 blocks from my loft downtown... so I had dreams of this being a weekly dining spot I walked to with friends and family.  I don't even have high standards... I love hole in the wall chinese food restaurants.    We ate Saturday night, and used a restaurant dot com coupon.  Ordered a ton of food, so tried lots of dishes.  The only really edible thing was the moo shoo port (spelling?).  That was about 6/10.  The rest was terrible.  I mean, mystery meat.  Made the McDonalds McRib look like Filet Mignon.  We ordered hong kong beef, one of their specialties... it was inedible gristly meat with Hines51 sauce or some other steak sauce poured over it... not asian at all.  I am so disappointed...  I will never return.  Even with the certificate, it was an evening and $40 final bill completely wasted.    If you do get forced to go here, do not get anything other than shrimp... I shudder at the quality of the other meat, just thinking about it days later.

Closed and re-opened.  Completely different ownership.  New place has better food, same cheap prices.  Had a bad experience with the manager, but when you can get a big bowl of good pho, so be it.  I will review under the new name after I go there again and hopefully the manager/server is gone.

I've eaten here probably 30 times over the last 3-4 years.  It's virtually the only place I regularly go for Sushi.  I've enjoyed Sushi all over the world, and while there is definitely better sushi, there is not better value.    So my review is really around the all you can eat Sushi.  I mean, it's virtually the same individual sushi prices you can get anywhere, for same quality, and perhaps cooler settings.  So there are dozens of places to go if you just want to order off the menu.  But where Sushi Q stands out is it's all you can eat.  Because unlike many places, it's really all you can eat of virtually all the sushi.  Handrolls, dozens of traditional rolls, about 15 varieties of fish over small pieces, miso soup, tempura, etc... all included for $24 for lunch, and I think about $27 for dinner.  And unlike many all you can eat sushi places, they don't lay it out on platters... it's all hand made, in front of you, and delivered on little wooden platters.  Cool.   So it's the same experience as ordering off the menu a la carte at a traditional sushi house.   The fish put on each piece is generous... thickly cut given the amount of rice.  It may not be the very highest quality of sushi, but at 1/3 the price, what do you expect.  It's still damn good, even for a guy who loves sushi and has tried it all over the world like me.    Hell, I'd come here twice a week if I could afford it.  If you are a big sushi eater, come here, take a couple hours to enjoy endless plates of handmade sushi, down a $6 large saki bomber special to go with it, and pay 1/3 the "full price" you would have paid a la carte.  And know there are few places that offer better Sushi Valley, in the US, let alone the Valley, than Sushi Q.

There are dozens of sushi places throughout Phoenix.  Many serve good sushi.  Some even serve it at a decent price.    There is ONLY ONE MAIN REASON to go to Sushi Q.  And that is their absolutely amazing, completely terrific all you can eat option.  It's $28, whether for lunch or dinner.  Prices have climbed in recent years due to increased sushi costs.  The owner and co-sushi chef, Eddie, has been forced to increase costs.  There are like 50 items on the all you can eat menu.  Most are unlimited.  The sushi is very good.  I'm not going to say it's the absolute top shelf sushi, although to be honest after eating at a couple dozen places in Japan and the US I'm not sure I've definitively eaten better.  It's fresh (the high quantity they go through with daily deliveries from a pure sushi supply company ensures this).  Most importantly, the all you can eat experience is like a regular sushi bar.  Go ahead and sit at the bar if you don't want a giant plate delivered to a table.  I think it's a much more fun experience getting fresh plates of sushi delivered to you and your companions as it's made, each plastic tray stacking up before being quickly carried to the kitchen.  I recommend the spicy tuna handrolls.  They stuff them with a ton of fresh tuna, freshly mashed, not premashed at some other factory.  And they don't fill it with a ton of "rabbit food", just warm rice, the seaweed wrapper, and about 4 tablespoons of tuna.  Rolls are great.  I recommend the rainbow roll.    The individual pieces of sushi are extra thick, extra wide.    I think they are easily 1.5 to 2 times the "weight" of a piece of sushi at other restaurants.  But come hungry.  It's not for the faint of heart.  If you aren't willing to pack away $40-60 worth of regular priced sushi, why bother?  It's an expensive treat for lunch of dinner.  But the regulars that come week after week, month after month know that Eddie and his crew serve the best all you can eat Sushi in the southwest.  Bank it.

All You Can Eat Is BACK!  $28, which is a bargain for what you get.  Three dozen rolls, at least a dozen types of fish, and various other things.    Come hungry!  It's a terrific value if you are even moderately hungry.    Waitress is top notch, chef/owner could be a bit friendlier but that's okay, and cute little indoor ambiance.   Don't let strip mall or construction scare you away, plenty of parking and it's very nice inside.  Best all you can eat sushi option in Phoenix.  Enjoy.

Best inexpensive Mexican Food in Phoenix.  Yes.  You read that correctly.  It's the place you take people to when they come to Arizona to visit you.  Not fancy pants New Mexico style food (you can got o Sierra Bonita grill, also 5 stars, for $25/pp meals).  This place just delivers Mexican Food like the 70's, only better.  Chips are hot and not greasy.  Two kinds of dip.  Their $7 lunch specials are all uniformly good.  Try the chicken quesadilla lunch special if you are feeling bad, or the $8 shrimp enchiladas in jalapeno butter if you are feeling decadent, or grilled chicken salad with tortilla soup (more like stew here) if you are feeling healthy.  On Wednesdays, you must try the best fish tacos in Arizona.  NOT FRIED.  Grilled tallapia type fish, with a little cream sauce, some shredded cabbage, in a corn tortilla.  I go with coworkers and they order 5 for $1.25 each, and along with the chips, they are stuffed to the gills and only spent $5 plus tip.  Seriously... Wednesdays for Fish Tacos.  Remember.  Even if you aren't usually a fan of fish tacos.  It's tacky decorations.  It's cheap vinyl booths.  And the service is not terrific (secret... if you are in a rush, bring your bill to counter to pay, don't wait at the table).  In a city of good Mexican food, if you are looking for entrees less than $12, there is no better Mexican food in Phoenix.

Service: 4 stars Setting: 3.5 stars (after remodel recently) Food:  5 stars is NOT enough Value: 5 stars  I live with 3 Thai restaurants within 3 blocks of my loft, highly rated.  I've now been RUINED... RUINED I say... to other Thai restaurants.  BTW, If you drove by this place without knowing about it,  I guarantee you would keep driving.  But it is simply one of the best Thai restaurants in the world.  My party of 6 dined like kings and queens on course after course... and had a $90 bill at the end of the night.  I couldn't pronounce or spell the dishes, so I won't embarrass myself by trying.  Read the reviews at the entrance, on the wall, while you wait, and then order those dishes.  You will NOT be disappointed.  Best thing we had was some crispy rice appetizer, which blew our minds.  If you see anything that resembles that, order it.  I go to Vegas maybe once a year.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that I will eat at LEAST two dinners there per 1 week stay, for years and years to come, at Lotus of Siam.

Brunch Review - Sunday 9am  Food: 5 Stars Service: 5 Stars Atmosphere: 5 Stars Value: 4 Stars  Group of 6 had breakfast here.  Beautiful setting in high ceiling french bistro setting overlooking landscaped pool area.  Got table right away, wasn't full at 9am, but was 2/3 full by the time we left.  Ordered pastry basket which had 4 outstanding pastries ($16).  Ordered coffee, which for drip, was outstanding ($3.50 each).    I ordered omelet of the day, which was excellent ($16).  Wife ordered sourdough waffles, which may have been best we've ever hard, topped with sauteed bananas ($12).    Other couple split chicken and waffles.  Waffles had bacon pieces in them, savory.  Chicken was roasted, not fried.  Tender and tasty, with great gravy.  Altogether, with some split meals and other stuff not mentioned, $96 tab for the 6 people.  Everyone ate plenty.  We walked away feeling it was one of the best breakfasts we've had in a long-time.  I have now found my "every time in Vegas" breakfast spot.  Highly recommended (and I'm a tough critic!).

If you can, get a group of friends together and make a reservation early!  They only take them for groups, but unless you want to wait 1+ hours, it's required on busy nights.  Nice setting, especially nice outside.    Ordered 7 pizzas for a group of 8, but that had some children.  All were good to great.  I think the simple pizza margherita was the best, and a great value at only $10.  When I come back, I think I'll be tempted just to order 2 of these and a salad for my family of two adults and two children.    Just a nice setting, cool older building, busy hip crowd, and great pizza that comes super hot and fresh out of the oven.   Only reason I am giving this a 4 star is that our service was slow.  I didn't mind too much since it was so busy and I was with great people, but it took about 20 minutes from when I asked for the check to when I was able to sign and walk away, despite me putting the credit card down immediately.  The server just had other priorities.  In fact, they had the table cleared and were literally seating other people at the table before we had the check back.  So a bit of a slip up.    Still, they were very friendly, and it was a great meal.  I recommend this highly as a  date spot or even a family spot.  Loud and so very easy to just focus on your table.

My favorite breakfast place.  Love the food, love the prices, love the decor.  But...  HATE THE WAIT.  They know me.  My wife and I bring our two small kids here every week or two.  But our AVERAGE wait time, sitting in front on nice modernist benches, is about 25 minutes.    It sucks.  I wish they would get rid of two rows of parking, put up an overhead tent with heaters/misters.  But I think the fact that people have to wait actually increases the love of the place?  Strange, huh.  Food is delicious.  I love the aged cheese omelet.  Go for the home fries, which are delicious and dusted with fresh rosemary, over the overly buttery hash browns.  Almost everything on the menu is perfect.  My kids do a single pancake, perfectly cooked, with great syrup.    Their bread may be the best part.  Fresh, thick cut bread with butter and fresh jam/jelly.  Look, it's a slightly upscale "diner food" that is well worth every $ you spend and every calorie you consume.    I hate to give a good review... what if even MORE people come and my wait is even LONGER... :(

I'm embarrassed to admit to my friends reading this review that I ate here.  It was terrible.  Bad service, dated setting, pretty terrible food, and outrageously "gouging" prices.  I sat for a minute at the keyboard searching for a positive... but here it is:  The Bar looked happening.  If I was drunk and 21, and with a bunch of friends, I would have gone.  But then... I couldn't have afforded it.  I ate here with my kids and wife, we were in the area, and thought it might be a "rainforest cafe" experience for my 5 year old.  Food was plentiful.  Wow... okay, found a second positive.  But for what I paid for such crappy food (almost Swill... look it up!), I'm actually embarrassed.  Do yourself a favor and WALK ON BY.  Surely, for the love of God, don't drive here to eat.

BETWEEN FAIR AND GOOD.  We went here on a Friday night.  I had short ribs, which were a big pile off the bone and recommended by the server, huge portion, tasty, and in general pretty good (I shared with everone and they were a hit with young and old).    My wife had the tuna, which was at best average.  I'm terrible cooking fish, and I do better.  What shined were the side dishes.  I dislike cornbread normally, but the cornbread caserole was filling and outstanding.  The mashed potatoes with cheddar tasted several hours old, but still were good.  My wife tried the cornbread and like it, but also tried the carrots and said they were very, very plain and disappointing.  Children had standard fair chicken fingers and fries for $5.  Other option was buttered pasta.  Can't complain about the price, but it would be nice if they had something a little healthier or interesting for the kids, like a very small portion of the short-ribs, which my kids loved.   So here is the verdict... setting was pretty nice, especially in the enclosed patio, but food was just okay for an upscale restaurant, and in general overpriced.  For $20-30 entrees, I expect tastier better food.  However, quantities were nice.    Use your GPS, because it's easy to get lost finding this place.  Just when you are about to turn around because it's residential, look to your right and it's there.  Would I be back?  Perhaps.  I would like to try the happy hour (we just missed it) and try greater variety.  But I think there are definitely much better options in this price range in this portion of Phoenix (for example, Sierra Bonita Grill up the street comes to mind).

This is a Quality over Quantity decision, folks.  You pay a premium for these seats, but they are easily 2x as comfortable, you aren't crowded with others, there are no screeming kids in strollers, in general this is a more upscale audience where you are not likely to get in the middle of a gang fight, etc.  For me, I made the decision to take my family's usual movie going schedule, and spend 1/2 of those seeing a movie at home with Redbox for $1, and half the time taking my family to this theater, paying $2-5 per ticket premium, and having more fun.  The food is Applebees in a theater, basically, with a $3-4 premium per dish for getting served at your seat.  Again, if you were going to an Applebees quality restaurant, pay the premium.  It's fun.  If you wanted upscale, there are lots of restaurants in the complex or across the street (use the tunnel, it's cool!).  One thing I recommend is skipping the popcorn.  It's a small bag, isn't as fresh as a usual theater, and runs $8.  No thanks.  If you want to spend $8, spend it on real food or candy.    For me, the difference between watching a movie in a theater like Harkins Christown or in AMC Esplanade is like the difference between First Class and a middle seat in Coach on a 12 hour transoceanic flight.  Yes, it's that big.    But it only costs $2-4 per ticket premium folks.  That's money well spent.  I mean, for me, it's a complete, total, no-brainer.  By the way, unlike the other reviews, the adults only theaters ARE more comfortable seats, but not THAT much more comfortable.  So if you have an equal choice, go with the adults only theater seats, but if not, don't be scared... still do it.

Quite simply, the best culinary experience in all of Arizona.    Worth every penny of a tasting menu.  Yes, it's inventive, festive, with lights, color, smells, etc.  It's not as stuffy as a tasting menu in Paris (nor 1/4 as expensive).  But that's part of the experience.  Everyone should go once, for some very special occasion and with someone you care about.  Go with an open mind, experience the taste of every bite, and remember that it's experiences and memories you collect that you can recall far more than a $100 physical item such as a new purse.  Enjoy!

As far as value goes, I've never seen a chinese restaurant that delivers half the value, whether in China or throughout the US.  Now, with that said, a bucket of pain, some linens, and some fake candles, and $50 spent in a china town on lanterns or some such, and this place would have 10x the charm.  I mean, it is really bad.  Worn floor, dirty walls, just okay tables, tightly packed, institutional lighting.    But the owner (head waitress/hostess) and her husband (head cook) whip up excellent food, in heaping quanities, for 1/2 the price they should charge.  It's usually at least 60% chinese patrons, ordering off a chinese menu that's extremely good if a bit more expensive.  If you are adventurous, ask for it and order a group menu.  I've had the chopped up dungeness crab, green beans in xo sauce, and 1/2 crispy duck many times... near perfection.  By the way, they produce like 1/2 the roasted ducks served in the whole valley... that says something when the other chinese restaurants come here for the food.  You'll see a constant stream of take-out.  Honestly, for $6 a plate, you get a ton of food, whether lunch or dinner.  I'm a big guy, and can eat a whole pizza in a sitting but I'm rarely able to finish a plate of food here.  Unlike vritually ANY chinese restaurant, they use only pure white meat, premium chicken breast.  So their chicken entrees are outstanding, with tons of plump, lean meat.  Also, any entree with Shrimp is outstanding, as they pile it with giant shrimp (the $9-15/pound kind at the store).  The beef dishes are a lot less tasty by comparison, so I'd stick with duck, chicken, and seafood.  Frankly, I feel guilty eating here with my family, and getting so much high-quality food, and payingso little.  I overtip, and encourage everyone to do so.  It's as if the owners really don't understand that their prices are too cheap.  And she is just the nicest person around.    Go here for the food, ignore the ambience, and enjoy!

It's just a terrific steakhouse.  One of the most upscale, all around dining experiences in Phoenix.   It's expensive.  Very expensive.  But probably worth it.  Figure $150-200 for a couple.  I had the double filet medallion with blue cheese melted and a wine demiglaze.  Absolutely outstanding, amazingly tasty meats.  Equal or better than Morton's or Ruth's Chris or Capitol Grill (that's on the menu for tomorrow night).  Smashed potatoes were very good but nothing to write home about.  Veggies were pretty good.  Started with the ceasar salary, with a big pile of anchovies.  Perhaps the best Caesar I've ever had.  Desert was the mouse cake.  Good, but not to die for.  Their happy hour is also an excellent value.  Come before six and drinks are half off, and they serve little mini steak sandwhiches, which are very good.  Hint:  If you have kids, go to happy hour and have a drink or two.  Cocktails are in the $7 range happy hour price.  Cucumber cooler was quite nice for a cocktail.  Let the kids eat the sandwiches, and then head to the dining room for a couple of filets.  The kids are pretty full, you are nicely primed for a great steak, and the complete lack of a kids menu doesn't matter.    Honestly, otherwise, there really aren't any good kids options.  I know, it's not a great place for kids, even well behaved, but sometimes you want to celebrate a special occasion with family.    It would be nice if they offered a mini-filet for 12 and under for like $15, or a burger and fries for $10 for the kids.  Just a thought.  Anyway, great experience, great food.  A really upscale, while linen, old style steakhouse kind of place to have prime beef.

MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN ALL OF PHOENIX.  And I love food!  I have yet to have any dish that wasn't 8 or 9 out of 10.   From simple food (the burger is the best burger I've had in my life, I swear), to brunch (the baked eggs is excellent, as is the mushroom and goat cheese omelet), to dinner or lunch (the chile verde is to die for!).  I read somewhere that the pudding desert ($7) is one of the top 100 dishes in the valley.  It's not huge, but perfect blend of flavors and gelato and just a 10 out of 10 desert.  Honestly, I'd eat here weekly if I wasn't afraid of growing tired of the food.  Ultra modern decor, clean, free valet, friendly owner/chef, and the most kid-friendly super fancy restaurant I've ever seen.  Anyway, I'm usually tough on restaurants, but this is my favorite place to eat, and I have a hard time imagining anyone could be disappointed for giving it a try.

The Orpheum Lofts are just a terrific place to live.  It's a relatively unique experience for Phoenix, although you could find lofts like this in most other major cities in the US.  The building is an Art Deco office building built in the 30's.  Other than the gorgeous original lobby and exterior, everything else is new.  Now it sells and rents far below replacement cost due to the crash.  The units themselves have high cement ceilings, exposed pipes and conduits, exposed venting.  The original warm crumbling brick exterior walls and original windows give it a warmth and light that is just unique in Phoenix.  Most units have tile and granite througout, with kind of a modern/retro theme going.  Very few people see the units and don't love/covet living in them.  Add a basement pool with swim jets, giant exercise room with equipment, steam room AND sauna, as well as a large rec/party room with full size pool table, and it's pretty cool.  A central desert courtyard is a great place to enjoy coffee and a book, nicely quiet amid downtown.  Guards operate about half the time, and a very secure system protects the building.  Light rail goes right along the front.  Dozens of great restaurants are within a quarter mile, not to mention walking to every weekend shows, events, games.  It's relatively dead on the weekends compared to the week, yet at any point from the corner you will see a dozen people.  The restaurants are generally busy as well.    Two negatives - HOA dues are high.  They weren't when these were $600k units, but now that they are closer to $100k, they appear high to most folks.  It takes a lot of cost to maintain such a cool older building, guards, pool, etc.  But they include a lot of extras like high-speed internet, Direct TV, etc.  The HOA is extremely healthy, unlike others, so there is a chance HOA fees go down, but they have always been the biggest negative.  Second is parking.  There is no parking garage that goes with your unit.  A group of owners have recently bought the lot next door, and operate it primarily as a set of nice parking spots for the owners of the lot, but they have plans to rent out space more widely.  If you buy you can likely buy one of the spots, possibly rent.  But most people prefer to park about 100 feet from the entrance in a downtown building lot with 24 hour security, for $75 per month per car.  You walk a bit farther but it's nice to have a fully enclosed set of parking.  So it's not cheap.  But the urban living, downtown retro loft vibe is near priceless, and the Orpheum lofts is absolutely the coolest place to live downtown, versus the "Marriott hotel room" look and feel condo buildings around it.  Take a look if you are in the market to buy or rent.

For  a hotel bar, it's decent.  If anyone heads downtown to go here just to go here, please move on.  Their food is just okay.  I've had the lamb sliders (okay, and interesting), the sweet potato fries (barely okay, just frozen fried stuff with cream sauce over top), the crab tacos (think mostly mayo and cold crab, in taco shells), and the tuna wraps (nice chunks of raw tuna, with pineapple?, in lettus, okay).  Beer on tap was down, nothing specactular.  Nice modern decor, like the rest of hotel.  Look, if I was in town on business and wanted to have a beer with colleagues, you could do worse than sliders and a beer at the bar.  But there are so many better restaurants downtown, including the truly outstanding Red Elephant just up the street a block (thai, not fancy, but outstanding food).  Or I'd try the Ghost Lounge for drinks in the San Carlo not too far away.

Nice atmosphere and corner space overlooking the grass and palms downtown.  However, the food was really not that great.  And for $15-30 per Entree, I expect at least good food, if not great.   Children's meals were decent at $4 for a bowl of pasta with alfredo sauce.    My wife had the chicen picatta.  I mean, if I fixed it at home, I'd eat it and not complain.  A little bland, but good comfort food.    I ordered the sirloin with a creamy shimp and asparagus sauce and smashed potatoes.  Potatoes were different... maybe a bit of pureed squash in there, but tasty.  The steak was terrible.  And the sauce was just okay... with tiny little weak shrimp.  I used a coupon for the restaurant, or I would have been mighty pissed off with the value.  Still, I doubt I will come back.  Too many outstanding restaurants in downtown or around there.  Service was extremely friendly and good, however.  I'm giving them 2 stars, but I could have possibly been convinced to give them one star.  Go elsewhere.

I went there for lunch on the weekend.  They weren't busy.  So I don't know what to say about service issues others have faced... if you are going for nighttime, it may be different.  I'm giving 5 stars because we thought the food was extremely good, and frankly, cheap for what you get.  Therefore, outstanding value.  One of the better values we've discovered recently.  We had a couple appetizers and two entrees (sandwiches).  The standout in my opinion was the steak sandwich, which was probably the best steak sandwich I've ever hard.  With perfectly cooked, juicy pieces of meat and a zesty Gorgonzola cheese.  For desert, my wife had gelato, I had a cannelloni.  What made the cannelloni so good was it was stuffed "just in time" so that the shell was super crisp and light, and the cream inside cold and good.  Perfection compared with most places, where the shell absorbs the moisture.  I'll be back.  I do think it's more of a casual deli kind of feel, but in a really cool neat restaurant and for the price and the quality of food, I really felt that 5 stars was warranted, and I don't give out a ton of those.

Setting - 5 star, beautiful, modern without being cold, giant glass overlooking pool Service - 5 star, attentive and excellent Food - 4.5 star Price - 4 star  Came here for Friday night dinner.  Everything we had was good.  Smoked chicken pizza was good, calamari was excellent, short ribs were flavorful, my wife's steamed salmon was rare and outstanding.   Dessert was good, not terrific.  Really didn't think it was outrageously priced, either, for Vegas.    Their happy hour looked outstanding and extremely reasonable... we will be back to try that out when we are in town again, and will review that then.    Overall, very solid experience.  It's kind of an elegant comfort food with Asian sushi kind of flair, I would guess, in a beautiful modern setting.  Seems to be an outstanding date or special occasion place, if that's what you are looking for.

My new favorite restaurant?  Beautiful simple setting.  Busy, crowded, fast moving.  Great date night or special occasion restaurant.  My wife had the 4 course tasting menu for $50 (appetizer, small pasta plate, main course, desert), with the $20 wine pairings for each.  With the little surprise tastes that everyone may get, who knows, it turned into a 6 course meal.  Healthy portions, very tasty.  The wine was nicely matched and excellent value.  I nibbled on her courses and just had the filet for $30.  Filet was very good (not spectacular, but if you want that you have to go to the best prime steakhouses), but what made the meal amazing was the mushroom risotto it sat over.  I love risotto, and it was the very best I've ever had.  I would go back and just order a big blowl/plate of that if I could!   It was a very special meal.  Excellent service.    We had reservations and still had to wait 35 min for a table, because they were genuinely that busy.  But what was nice is that the manager just came over, without a word from us or even a look, and had the bartender make two of her best signature drinks on him.  What a nice touch!  How many managers of nice, busy restaurants would do that.  Make a terrific meal even better to be treated that way.  $110 tab before tip... worth ever penny!

First of all, the wife and I do enjoy this place.  The food is very good, if not great, and we never leave hungry.  Of course, we routinely order $100-150 in final tab price meal.  I've had the filet, perfectly cooked and good, but a bit salty.  I've also head the salmon, which is a bargain on the menu... $18 yields you two relatively large strips of salmon over mixed vegetables, in a delicious butter sauce with lemon taste.  I've had the seafood platter twice as an appetizer my wife and I shared.  Also, the toper of chocolate moose is one of the best fancy deserts I've ever had, anywhere.  Almost worth going just for that.  Please pay the $9 and be grateful it's one of the better values on the menu... perfect date desert.  Their fries are very filling... duck fries our outstanding.  We use restaurant dot com for $25 and $50 and $100 certificates.  I'm not sure I could spend $150 for a couple at this restaurant and feel good about it otherwise.  But getting $75 off $150 in food allows for going crazy, and when we go nuts when we get these, especially for 80% off, we have a good time and the reastaurant still comes out ahead..  Just had dinner there last night with my 9 year old daughter... special night out.  I ordered the salmon, she the mozzerlla and tomato pizza for $12, which was huge and could have fed two kids.  But I would never bring a younger child here.  No drinks, finished with the tower of mouse, which my daughter thought was the coolest thing she'd ever seen, and $50 before coupon, $25 after.  This is a terrific date night or special occasion place to dine, and the cool modern decor is an interesting compliment to the french cuisine.

For a hotel restaurant, 5+ stars.   For a freestanding restaurant of this price range, 3.5 stars.  Surprise Best Part - Complimentary Cotton Candy at end of meal!  I went here on a Sunday night for dinner.  All the food we ate was good to great.  Downside was portions were smaller than almost any other restaurant we've eaten at.  They are almost "tasting menu" sized portions.  For a starter, we each had the mixed salad, which was outstanding.  One of freshest, best "side" salads I've ever had.  It all comes from local sources, including 4th floor garden.  Marinated onion was mind-blowing.  For entree, we both had salmon.  It was a perfectly great dish.  The problem?  It was about 3 ounces of fish.  No way it was 4.  I mean, it was tiny.  Did it taste good?  Absolutely.  But it felt like it was gone in 3 bites.  And for $24, I expect more than 3 ounces.  Come on, chef!  Don't be a complete cheapskate.  For desert, I had the berry cobler.  It was great.  Not outstanding, but definitely top 25% of any cobbler type dish I've ever had.  So, final verdict?  If you are staying downtown on a corporate travel budget - GO!  If paying yourself?  - Go to happy hour and partake, or maybe go here if not looking for a hearty meal, even at 3 courses...  I live downtown and this is one of the 2 best restaurants downtown for "fine dining."  The other, if you are curious, is Nobuo Teeter House.  Which makes District look cheap.  Enjoy!

FOOD TASTE/QUALITY:  Okay SETTING:  Nice - outside and inside seating, downtown, great location PRICE:  Outrageous   X-LARGE 1 topping pizza (Pepperoni):  $22  I live right near by.  I'd love it if this place had even fair pricing.  But the pizza is okay to good, if I'm feeling generous, and it's 2x the price I'd expect.  Despite the convenience, I just won't pay the price.  It's packed at lunch.  Great lunch specials for the working crowd downtown.  At night, it does a fair business, mostly to people downtown for sporting events or at the nearby Orpheum theater.  Maybe people just don't care about getting gouged.  But they've got to get realistic on pizza prices.  Especially for carryout, at night.

Used to live three blocks away.  Went here twice.  Both times, very dissapointed.  I mean, the food is mediocre at best.  And it's WAY overpriced.  If I'm going to pay this price, I expect good food... maybe even great food.  If this place had been better I probably would have gone here weekly.  But the fact that it was one of the few decent Sunnyslope options, and I went here twice in 5 years, says something.  I don't know what it is, but everything in this little subdivision is run by related family members, as far as I know.  And interestingly enough, despite them being genuinely nice people, it's all of mediocre quality and over priced items.  Look elsewhere.

Disappointing.    I've eaten here about 5 times over the last couple years.  This review is for the last two times, over the last 1 year.    First, service has been bad on both occasions.  Seems like they either have assigned twice as many tables to each waiter as they should, or the waiters just are rude, but I have experienced unacceptable waits for each stage of the dining on both occasions, with two separate servers, so there is a real problem.  With that said, servers were nice and professional when they were there... just took too long.  Second, atmosphere is just okay.  You're typical mid-market seafood joint.    Third, the food is just okay.  I mean it's maybe a 3 out of 5 stars, depending on what you order.  Portions are on the smaller side.  I've tried the Mahi Mahi (crispy fried in olive oil on outside with what tasted like a Montreal Steak Seasoning), as well as their Scallops.  The scallops were by far the best.  The fresh sourdough bread is outstanding... I could eat several baskets if I let myself!  But for my fourth point, and the most important, the VALUE is NOT there.  It's too expensive for what you get.  I feel like every entree, if it was $3-4 cheaper, would be fair price.  Maybe.  But for just "average to good" food, it's not worth the prices.    I told myself after eating there last night I won't be back.  Perhaps I'll forget that pledge, but I hope not.  Go elsewhere (such as McCormick & Schmick's just up the road in Esplanade).

I had a energy audit done to my home in Payson.  David's team did a great audit, then  David met with me to review the proposal.  I found the entire process very professional and informative.  I then validated the information with others and via the web, and found it all excellent.  I did decide to upgrade the level of insulation over what he recommended, and paid a little more as a result.    I believe I paid $3500 for all the work that was recommended, and now a year later, the savings generated from all the work performed, is looking like a 3 year payback period, which is very amazing.  Everything they recommend COULD be done by other specialty vendors.  But the bottom line is these guys will do it with greater attention to detail, the right way, the energy efficient way.  And I think that it's worth paying a slight premium over having to find 5 individual vendors, coordinate them, and deal with lower quality.    All the workers were great.  David was great.  They delivered what they promised.  I'm very happy that I ended up calling Green ID and having them do the work they did.  I think almost any home older than 10 years should have this done, and would highly recommend proceeding with what they propose, as long as you plan to be in the home for at least 3-4 years.  At least, that's how I would do it if I bought another home.  I ended up recommending Green ID to my father and sister, and I don't recommend vendors to my family unless I'm pretty sure of them.

"Extremely Cool Without Being Pretentious"  Second time at the Vig Uptown.  Brunch.  Just really cool modern surroundings... but not just surface modern, but deep modern aesthetics that just feel comfortable and real.  Sat in the atrium type outside, which is really like an inside garage with big windows and air conditioning.  It's like being outside in the best temperature in Phoenix, even if it's over 100 degrees.  Food was very good.  Relatively large portions for an upscale establishment.  My wife had the $15 salmon, recommended by the server as the best thing on the menu, and it did not disappoint.  Would easily cost 2x at other restaurants, and probably be worth it.   I had the Hangover cure, and it was easily enough food to take home and have for breakfast the next day.  Very tasty for $10.  And I got the $3 spicy bloody mary that came with it, which was one of the best bloody mary's I've ever had.  At noon, on the Sunday we went, a really nice band came in and played some great acoustic rock, very nice.    It was one of the best brunch experiences we've had in Phoenix.  Add to this the fact that all wine on the menu, if ordered by the bottle, is 50% off, and that's an outstanding deal.  We'll be back.  I kicked myself for not coming back sooner.    My five star is a rating that is influenced by pricing.  I am a cheap bastard with expensive tastes, so I reward a restaurant that I not only feel I had great food, nice ambiance, and good service, but that I got my money's worth.  And The Vig Uptown is all that and then some.  I strongly recommend it to all.

What a pleasant find.  It's in a corner of the casino, still within view of the floor.  Most of the seating is at an upscale bar where you see the chef preparing your food.  I never would have gone here if I wasn't going to be at the casino for another event, but I'm glad I did.  I ordered the mixed seafood boil, and it was outstanding ($18, and surprisingly, worth every penny).  Just a ton of seafood in a rich sauce that I had to clean up with a ton of their excellent bread.  They ask you to order on a 1-10 scale.  My mother likes a little spice but tried the 3 and said it was almost too hot.  I order a medium to medium hot in a Thai restaurant, and got a 6, and I was sweating and it was at the edge of my comfort zone.  So be forwarned... it's spicy.  My father, however, ordered a 9, and said it was spicy but not as spicy as he wants.  He orders Thai hot usually.    I shared an order of the clams, which were tasty but perhaps a bit expensive at nearly $15.  I saw numerous shrimp cocktails, which looked gigantic and tasty, but didn't see the price or try it.  If not too unreasonable, it looked like 5 gigantic prawns, so a substantial appetizer.  Anyway, I'll be back.  Which is surprising, because I usually hate to step foot in a casino.  But it's just an outstanding, unusual meal.  Give it a try if you love seafood and creole cooking.

Downside is you pay for street parking.  And tiny, tiny inside area where the owner claims he can squeeze in 25 people, but more than 10 is entirely too close for comfort.  Go there when nice outside so you have best options.  Food is generally pretty good.  Had the mussels, which were tasty for $10 and pretty hearty sauce.  Sandwiches were the biggest miss, but not terrible.  Pizza was nice sized... could easily fill two adults if they share an app and desert.  Has pizza with truffle oil and pesto for like $12-14, and it was excellent.    Risotto looked good, but didn't try.  I will be back for sure.  My wife liked it more than I did, but I didn't dislike it much at all.  A pretty solid 3.5 to 4 star.

I like Centurion.  It's got more space now after their expansion, and it's a quirky, unusual experience.  You feel really close to the kitchen and chefs, and the food is always good.  It's terrific that after 5pm weekday and all day Saturday and Sunday, street parking is completely free (so no need to add coins).  Trust me, I live downtown.  Their 7 course tasting menu is unbelievably tasty ($50 for food only, $75 with wine pairings).  The 21% gratuity they automatically add though is highly annoying (15% is fine, 18% okay, but 21% is a mugging).  Service is good.    Their risotto of the day is unbelievable ($8).  They make the best risotto in all of Phoenix, in my opinion, and are creative  Their pizzas are good too, but maybe a dollar or two too expensive.  Their mussels are also a standout and fairly priced.  Personally, I'd stick with the three above for an everyday dinner, and the tasting menu for a special occasion like an anniversary.   Their brunch is also fun.

UPDATED A COUPLE MONTHS AFTER THIRD VISIT:  I've lowered the stars a bit.  Had a couple coupons, so visited again.  The pasta went downhill, and on third visit, didn't even really like the pizza as much.  Service was still just okay at best.  I've moved this into the category of "old school" Italian restaurants that aren't very upscale or authentic, but that a lot of people, especially older people, enjoy because it's very much like the 1950's or 1960's "Version" of an Italian restaurant.  Probably deserves somewhere between 2 and 3 star.  I doubt I will be back.  It's just not my bowl of pasta.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: It looks like a hole in the wall kind of restaurant from the street.  One lightbulb was burnt out on the sign, for example.  But once you walk in, it's an eclectic, fun blend of a 1950's "americanized Itallian" restaurant and one of the downtown urban chic minimalist restaurants.  Very unique, very fun.    Service was friendly, but the high-school aged waiter wasn't very attentive.  Water glasses were empty several times, had to flag him down after 10 minutes after meal to get the check.  So service is maybe 3 stars, possibly 2.  But I really felt that it could have just been bad luck with the waiter or possibly just a busy night.  So I'm not holding it against them too much.  Food was four stars.  The complimentary appetizer "pizza dough" bread with drizzled olive oil and spices was chewy and outstanding.  The calimari was 5 star, and would be ordered again.  The pizza margarita was terrific and large, and tasted great then and the next day for breakfast.  At $8, it was a steal, and will be ordered again.  The $14 chicken parm was hearty.   Instead of thin chicken, it was like two medium sized regular breasts breaded and deep fried, then served with shaved sheets of cheese. My wife found it salty, but I found it tasty, as did my daughter.  We struggled to finish it.  I'd give it 4 stars.  My wife ordered the mushroom Parpadelle.  It was excellent, EXCEPT for one thing... it as too al dente.  I mean, she's itallian and like al dente, but this felt like it had been boiled for about 1/2 the time.  We were in a time pressure situation, and it was still edible and tasty, so we didn't return or complain.  But clearly the chef needs to test his pasta before sending it out.  The sauce was great however.  So 2 stars, obviously.  Altogether, we will be back.  I will likely order 3 pizzas for my family of four, or maybe 2 pizzas and an appetizer.  Value felt very fair.  It's not cheap food, but it's not $20 pasta entrees, and at $14 I felt fairly priced.   Service could be more attentive, and consistency of food could be slightly better, but I feel very comfortable with 4 stars and  a solid recommend.

IMPORTANT:  You will spend $50 per person here, and walk away slightly full, NOT stuffed.  You need to get that through your head to enjoy this place.  I dropped $110 including tip, and no alchoholic drinks between my wife and myself (just one iced tea).  We had 9 dishes, including 3 appetizer, 3 "entree" and 3 small deserts.     We ate everything on every plate... and at the end of the night, we still could have easily eaten more.    So this isn't a place you go to "fill up."  Budget $50 easy per person, then when you get there, SPEND it all on dishes.  And have absolutely no regrets, because you've prepared yourself.  And then be prepared to be blown away by the tastes and presentation of each dish.  Each dish comes out for the table one at a time, maybe 10 minutes apart.  Each will inevitably be deemed "delicious" by all a the table.  Each will likely be the best version of whatever it is, you've tasted for a long while... maybe ever.  Seabass and Mushrooms in white paper.   I've never had fish that tasted like that... and the mushrooms blew my mind.  Tofu fried tater tots... absolutely delicious.    Soft shelled crab sliders... amazing.  Maybe my favorite.  The pork in the buns was the most "normal dish", but terribly good.  It was really all very outstanding.  Perhaps one of the best "date" restaurants if you want to blow some money, that I've found in Phoenix.  Of course I couldn't have afforded it when I was dating... so small problem.  But if dropping $100 on amazing tastes and flavors and not at least being thoroughly full at the end bothers you, don't go, as it will be an exercise in frustration.  No point being stressed about the money you are spending.  There is a place for restaurants like this.  And they are terrific.  But you have to get your mind straight.  I will be back.  Sorry if I come across as a cheap bastard with expensive tastes... but... I am.  And Nobuo is worth every penny.

Consistently Dissappiointing  For some strange reason, a couple of my coworkers keep getting groupons here and we go.  The food is really quite terrible.  And it's about 2x the price of what it's worth.  I've had their cheap lunch specials, and they all range between swill and what I would expect at a food truck at a fair.  So I decided, maybe I'm just getting their cheap food.  That's the problem.  So I order a full rack of their $23 babyback ribs.  They didn't come with sauce.  They tasted like they were grilled 2 days ago and regrilled twice since (dry, stringy, etc.).  The sides were mediocre.  Look I expect DAMN GOOD ribs for $23.  Not the crap I was served.  To top it all off the day manager was one of the rudest guys I've encountered when my friend tried to use the groupon, the waitress didn't record the number right, but then redeemed.  Insisted that we call groupon back, wait in cue, then have it unredeemed, so he could do it himself.  Like we were thieves... and despite the waitress telling him she saw that it was unredeemed.  Just a downright expensive, terrible experience.  The manager deserves to be fired if anyone reads this that gives  a damn.  I surely won't be back.  And yeah, I know I probably said that last time.  But I'm never, ever going to be back.  Ever.

We've eaten here twice.  Both on weekend, one for breakfast, one for lunch.  Setting is great.  Nice atmosphere.    Service is fair.  Friendly, but not overly attentive.  Food is just okay.    Here is the GREAT thing about them for breakfast/lunch.  The $10 mimosa special is an entire bottle of champagne with a large caraffe of orange juice.  Enough to get 3-4 people tipsy over breakfast.  $4 bloody mary was decent.  Mac & Cheese is tasty but nothing gourmet about it.   Chicken sandwhich with bacon was just okay.  Pretzel bun best part.  Eggs are okay on the breakfast platter as well.  Fries with grated parmesan cheese and red sauce dip is okay, but nothing special.  After two times, with all of the fantastic places to eat downtown, I probably won't be back.  Seems like it's a better place to go to visit the bar than the restaurant.  When busy, with outdoor, it would be a terrific venue.

The steamed clams are amazing.  Salty, but really good spicy juice, nice little clams, and three slices of toasted bread to mop it all up.  A real favorite and a surprise at $8.  Pizza is just okay.  It's not wood-fired goodness like most have come to expect.  Expect a crust more like Pizza Hut than Pizzeria Bianco.  But instead of a pizza hut pizza toppings, you get fairly creative.  And like most pizza, it's not hard to eat and enjoy.  It's just not gourmet, and arguably not worth $13-15 for a 12" pizza.   Skip the margarita.  At $13, something is missing and for an extra $1-2 you get much more interesting fair.  Add in $3+ for validated parking.  Not a terrible meal by any means, and the inside is fairly pleasant, but have low expectations and you won't be disappointed.

This downtown location is almost always busy.  In a very nice corner of a nice new shopping/dining/pedestrian mall.  Outside seating nice, inside is nice.  It's new, so shiny, bright, clean.  I live two blocks way, and dine here about once a week.  A regular double cheeseburger with back and "all the way" topings and regular fries will feed two modestly hungry people, say a skinny woman and man, with fries to spare.   $12.  Get two regular burgers and fries, add 3 or 4 bucks, and you've got a rich meal.    The burgers are great for fast food.  Better than in n out, better than any other fast food burger.  Fries are $2.50 but they serve like the equivalent of 2-3 extra large McDonalds fries portions, so it feeds me, the wife, and two small kids and we are stuffed.    They serve peanuts in the shell for a fun, messy way to pass the time waiting for the burgers to cook, and you can easily wait 10-15 minutes for your food to be ready.    Overally, the only negative is that these guys make such huge margins... charging $12 for a burger and fries in a fast food setting feels like highway robbery.  They get away with it because the quality is outstanding.    But honestly, I could get a better burger and fries, for about the same price, at a great restaurant.    So you be the judge.  If you are a quality over quantity person in terms of bang for your buck, then come here and endulge.  But this would be an expensive lunch habit if you work downtown and eat here often.  Of course you'd likely drop dead from a coronary far before you went broke.  And for the love of god don't order online.  They just hold your order until you arrive, as people have complained otherwise that the fries aren't fresh.  It maybe saves 5 minutes off the process, and of course waiting in line, but unless you are going during lunch rush hour, just head down there with a book or a companion.

A debate between 2 and 3 stars.  Food was actually okay.  Not great, but not bad.  Nachos with chunks of seasoned meat, sour cream, fresh guac, slice jalepenos, etc... pretty generously sized for like $8.   We enjoyed it, and it was very filling.   Salsa was top notch.  Fresh, spicy, good.    My wife and I each had fajitas, and shared with kids.  Very family friendly place.    8pm Saturday, only about 15 people in the whole restaurant.  Chicken fajitas were better than shrimp, nicely cooked and sliced.  Lots of shrimp, but smaller shrimp than I would have liked for a $15 entree.  My wife thought it would have been better if there were more veggies... it was about 2/3 meat.  Service was good and courteous.  This used to be a chain restaurant for a decade, and then it shut down due to lack of business.  The general manager of the restaurant under the chain took over the lease and is running a very similar restaurant under his own management.  The inside is fairly standard, if a bit dated.   Bottom line, the food was okay.  I wouldn't hate eating there again, but in a city full of amazing "hole in the wall" cheap Mexican restaurants and really fun upscale "new" Mexican fare, it just doesn't do enough to distinguish.  And for the prices, it needs to distinguish, because I think it is at the high end for the food quality and the setting.  I do wish the new owner the best though.

Went there for lunch.  Split a chopped salad and a deviled eggs.  Large portions.  Salad was a bit heavy on sauce, but I liked it.  Deviled eggs had some truffle oil which made them pretty good.    Burger was gigantic.  Ordered onion rings that were just not good at all... must be frozen pre-bought, which sucks.  Burger kind of tasted oily bland.  Tried to add mustard, and it wasn't terrible, but for an upscale burger at $12 expected just a bit better.  Companion had sweet potato fries which were much better.  Service even though the place was dead was very slow.  Not unfriendly, but they need to realize people that go for a mid-week lunch usually don't have 1.5-2 hours to eat.  All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience.  I really like the ambience... love the modern look of brick and blackened steel.    But I'd probably be more interested in coming here for beers and drinks with a couple appetizers, than a sit-down meal.  For a meal, there are just much better central Phoenix locations.

Extraordinarily ordinary.  At here on a Saturday late morning with wife and two kids.  First, there was a wait for tables, which is fine and frankly expected on the weekend at a small cafe.  But then they sat us and no waiter showed up.  Once fixed, service was really marginal for the rest of the meal.    Food was just okay.  Wife had the turkey burger, which was just very boring and not exceptionally tasty.  I had the Tryst Omelet which was reasonably priced but very underwhelming in presentation and taste.  The sweet potato tater tots sounded cool, looked cool, and tasted pretty great for the first five or six in your mouth.  But there were a LOT of plates I saw taken away with nearly full portions of the tots.  Kids meals were just okay.  The kids burger had a patty that tasted worse than any McDonalds or school lunch program burger I had in High School.  Setting is an upscale strip mall.  Inside is pleasant.  With outdoor tables and misters, this would be a terrific late Fall through Early Spring breakfast joint if you live in the area.   Food isn't terrible.  As a whole, better than a Denny's.  But really nothing exceptional at all.  And the owners were nice and friendly, but they need to teach their servers better manners and to spend less time flirting with co-workers and more time focused on taking care of the customers.  I surely won't go out of my way to come back, but if I had an hour to kill for breakfast and was in the area, might give it another shot if nothing else looked better.  I mean, not every place can be a Matt's Big Breakfast or St. Francis or any of the other exceptional restaurants around town, but the food, service, and atmosphere earns this place a solid 2 stars.

If you want to have a beer while watching a independent or arthouse movie, especially in a theater completely free of children, then this IS your theater.  It's a deceptively comfortable and big screen theater, with nice chairs, as well as tables in the back.  Have 2-3 pints while watching a cool flick, or maybe even a bottle of wine.  Or have a before show drink, then carry it in when the theater starts.  It's a neat experience.  Don't be turned off by the exterior... it looks like a mid-century small insurance agency from outside.  But once you walk in the doors, it's dark, great mood lighting, velvet everywhere, and just very mellow.   The perfect drink and a movie date place?

I'm a cheap bastard with expensive tastes.  So my reviews are geared toward getting somewhat "foody" dishes at what i consider reasonable prices.  With that said, Thirteen North gets one of my very rare 5 star reviews.  I only dined there once, for lunch.  It's set in a strip mall, and easy to drive by without noticing.  But inside, it's very nicely decorated for a great lunch or dinner place.  Relatively modern, clean, welcoming.  We ordered the chips with crab dip ($7).  Easily enough for 2-3 to share as an appetizer.  It was terrific, with freshly fried chips heavily seasoned with something zesty, similar to Old Bay seasoning, with a nice portion of crab dip.  Felt it was an outstanding value, and we cleaned the platter.  I next had their 13 North Burger ($10), cooked well done.  It was a healthy sized burger, cooked perfectly, with a nice bun.  The blue cheese really popped and gave it a terrific flavor, and the mounds of perfectly grilled onions complimented it nicely.  I was stuffed.  The french fries that came with it were fair, neither outstanding nor bad.    My lunch companion ordered sweet potato fries that came with a sweet chili sauce, which was a surprisingly good compliment.  Three daily specials for lunch all sounded great and were a very reasonable $8.  Look, when you can get away with $30 for two for a two course lunch and are nicely full and feel the food was upscale, I consider that a great value.    I will be back for lunch, and probably also for a casual dinner.  If I lived around here, this would definitely be a neighborhood gem, and on a short list of reasonably priced lunch or dinner rotations.  Give it a try.

Really hit or miss.  First of all, the atmosphere is terrific.  Modern, minimalist, big open spaces.  Very nice.  Ouside patio, when the weather is right, would be lovely for cocktails and food, around a fire pit.    I've eaten here twice.  Once for lunch, once for dinner.  The restaurant clearly is for hotel guests and corporate types.   I live downtown, so tried it despite this.  The food as a whole is decent to good.  It's very hit or miss though.  For example, last night my wife orders the organic salmon.  It was absolutely delicious, cooked perfectly, slightly rare inside and crispy on the outside.  On par with the best fish houses I've ever tried.  For me though, I tried the skirt steak.  It was a $2 piece of meat, barely adequately cooked, drenched in about 100 grams of fat/oil.  I guess to hide the fact that you just got completely scammed into eating a tough, fatty, crappy piece of meat.  I guess I'm more of a filet kind of guy, but honestly, this was one of the worst steaks I've tried.  Deserts were okay.  Appetizers were just okay as well.  Presentation of everything was outstanding, however.  I'd even be back here many times if it was more reasonable in price.  But for the money they are charging, I just demand better food, better service.  Even if the menu is creative, and the setting is one of the nicest modern restaurants I've recently had the pleasure to dine in.  Particularly frustrating since it's only two blocks from my loft.  By all means, if you go here, skip the steak!

I came here for lunch with a coworker.  We were in and out in about 35-40 minutes, just perfect.  Service was excellent, courteous, etc.  It's set in a strip mall, and inside you get very interesting Uzbek music videos playing, which kind of sets the vibe.  It looks the back of the restaurant could be a stage for some dancing, which is kind of interesting.  Everything has pictures, which makes ordering easy.  We ordered a nice tabbouleh salad ($2.50), which tasted incredibly fresh (I'm not a huge fan of this salad, but it seemed healthy, and this was as good as any other I had tried), and was easily enough to share with 2-3 people as a small appetizer.  I tried a recommended dumpling appetizer ($8), which was 5 giant steamed dumplings with onions and meat minced inside, very interesting but good.  For the main course, we each had a sandwich.  I had the kebob sandwich, with nice lean chunks of steak inside, pickle, onions, sauces, etc. in a pita.  Nicely filling, and a great value at $5.  My companion had the chicken version, minus pickle, for $4.50.  So for less than $20 prior to tip, we had a nice two course meal for two.  Outstanding value, quality ingredients (I judge the quality of a restaurant a lot by the quality of the meat they put in things like sandwiches).   Good service, okay ambiance.  This isn't a romantic date night spot, but if you are looking for something out of the ordinary with quality food, I think you could do a LOT worse than Golden Valley.  The fact that the prices are so cheap is just a bonus.  I'll be back.

These are the best cupcakes I've ever had.   So, so much better than Tammy Coe or any of the other dozen I've tried in the valley.  And here is the best advice I've EVER given on Yelp:  Order the Nutella frosting on Banana.  It will absolutely, completely, and guaranteed blow your mind.  I'm dead serious.  The other flavoers are good to great.  Never had a bad flavor.  But the Nutella (and I'm not a big Nutella fan, never putting it on anything), are transcendent.  Honestly, these things disappear at my office, at my home, at parties, faster than anything I've ever seen.  I've never seen anyone stop at one... unless it was the last one or they see a 5 year old walking over to it, and are socially shamed by reaching out to take the last one.  I have a hard time paying "full bakery" prices for things.  Cakes, cupcakes, etc.  If you've never tried this place, I don't blame you for being very skeptical for "delivery cupcake" prices.  But the Cupcake Cafe could honestly double their prices and I would still pay the price (but don't do it... just dont!!!).  Seriously, order today.   And read my other reviews if you think I'm someone that just gives out 5 star reviews like candy on Halloween.  I'm normally brutal!

Review is for Dinner/Weekend - for mid-week lunch, price points and food seem good.  I live downtown, so I love new restaurants.  There are three Thai restaurants within 3 walking blocks of where I live, and this is one of them.  It's frustrating that the jack up their prices so much for evening/weekend food, then complain when they are dead on the weekend.  Hello!  It's downtown.  If you want to stay busy on the weekend, you should at LEAST offer the same deals on the weekend, if not actually offer cheaper prices.  $10 bucks for minced chicken and stir fried veggies.  Ordered Basil plate, hot.  Was medium spice at best.  I finished my plate.  It wasn't terrible.  It wasn't terribly expensive either, of course.   Service was okay.  Only patron at restaurant at 12pm.  I just won't be back.  I think it's the lesser of the 3 downtown Thai restaurants.    Again, for weekday lunch, I might very well have different review, given the value it represents with a bowl of soup, etc.  But for the price, quantity, taste... I'll frequent other restaurants first.

FOOD:  2-2.5 Stars SERVICE:  1 Star is Too Many  Had 3 pies I needed for Thanksgiving.  Emailed and exchanged emails to pay for delivery of pies for $8.  No problem.  Even checked in a few days before to confirm delivery.  Response was no problem.  So day before thanksgiving, no pies arrived.  All day long.  I had wanted them before noon, per email, as I was leaving work early.   Called pick up location... supposedly many upset customers, no one had cell phone for Slade Grove.  At 5:30, the office shut down, two messages left, four emails, I had to leave and show up to a dinner party with no dessert.    NOT A SINGLE RESPONSE FROM OWNER ON ANY EMAIL, and they weren't even nasty at all.  I mean, anyone I know would have been nasty, but I don't believe in that.  Honestly, I was sure he must have been in an accident or some other emergency, and I would hear from him, no response.  So Christmas rolls around.  I write to him again, a week and a half early, ask for 3 pies.  Exchange emails with confirmations, no problems.  No mention from him again on earlier problem.  This time, I'm picking them up from pick-up place, a postal store.  When I got to pick up, only 2 of 3 pies are there.  No explanation.  Owner of store says "I'm lucky to get any, as many people didn't get any pies they ordered."  So I take the pies home and eat them.  They were OKAY.  Not great, not even good.  Just okay.  I wouldn't pay $10 for one of them, let alone their $33 retail price tag.  They look like some brand new culinary student made them.  Maybe he brought it help for the Christmas order.  Whatever.  And they taste pretty decent, but not good.  I can't tell you how disappointing the whole experience has been.  Sorry, all caps:  THIS GUY SHOULDN'T BE IN BUSINESS.  Some people just aren't made to run a business.  They don't have a lick of common sense, or business customer service, etc.    I'm sure the guy can bake.  I'm sure his food is delicious.  But he needs to work for someone else, who can operate a small business.  If you are thinking of relying on this guy to deliver food for an event, my advice is think again.  He burned me and many others... TWICE.  I'm not even going to try and get my 3rd pie I pre-bought.  Not worth the mental aggravation.  STAY AWAY.  You've been warned.

Really mediocre.  I've been here half a dozen times.  I live downtown, so like to give every restaurant downtown a fair shake.    They don't ruin anything.  Setting is just okay enough to not be terrible.  Service is poor, but they smile just enough to show that they are somehow trying, if misguided.  Food is just tasty enough that you finish your plate.  Basically, anything with Pernil Asado, their specialty dr. pepper slow stewed beef, is going to be good.  Pretty much everything else sucks.  Their nachos at 11 are small, weirdly not hot, and taste like I ordered them at an airport bar.  Their drinks and beer are okay, just expensive.  Basically, that is the bottom line.  If the food cost $2 bucks less per plate, it would be probably worth it as expectations would be lower.   So... eat here if you are downtown and nothing else seems to be open, but surely don't drive downtown for this place.   Lots of better options in Cityscape and around it.  They do have a pretty happening, cool patio on Friday and Saturday months during the cooler times, like mid Oct.

This little gem on central is our favorite frozen yogurt spot in the Valley.  I think its prices seem reasonable compared to other places we've been; I never feel ripped off.  I like their toppings to, especially fresh berries.    Their punch card discount program is also a nice little savings if you come often so ask for one.  It's the yogurt that just seems to taste a little better here than other places.    Lastly, this is one of the few yogurt shops that might be "cool" to hang out at.  It's got a coffee house kind of vibe to it, and their couch and "living room" setup is pretty comfortable, plus they have a few outdoor tables.  If I had to find a negative, some of their employees over the years are college aged women who frankly need to be instructed on service and filmed by the owner.  They are not unfriendly usually, but normally not very friendly.  Smiles are rare, even for regulars.  In recent weeks/months it's been better I think.  Every single customer should be greeted with direct eye contact, a clear hello/welcome, and after purchase and/or when the customer leaves, a "Thank you" or "Goodbye".  Sadly, this retail 101 isn't carried through.  And I think if this was emphasized by the owner, many of the somewhat negative reviews on here would fade away.

Great inexpensive wraps.  Just right sized for meal.  Fruit side is outstanding. Garlic fries are tasty if you don't mind an unhealthy indulgence.  Free flavored water out of this world.  Felt guilty how low the bill was compared to quality.  I've been back a few times and will keep returning.  I just wish they were open for dinner.

Cheap.  Healthy.   Great.   Perfect breakfast spot for 2 to 4.  Had Sunday family of 4 breakfast there and waffles and pancakes were outstanding.   Kids grilled cheese outstanding. Highly recommend banana pancakes.  Rosemary potatoes underdone a bit and just okay. Scramble and grilled veggies very good too with eggs. I'm not a vegan. Funky cool.  Great find. Easy street parking.

Outstanding happy hour.  1/2 off beers gets you a $3 pint.  Half off good wine is like $5-6 per glass.  You can order from happy hour menu from tables, which are crisp, clean room, not too close together.  It's a nice experience.  Plates are small, but if you order enough you can share.  Ribs are good ($9) and worth trying.  Foam yogurt dipping "sauce" was just okay.   Mussles ($11) were good.  Sauce was outstanding.  Decent portion, and you'll use all the bread mopping up the sauce.    Fries were okay ($4, same as regular menu).  Nothing special.  But the dipping sauces were worth it.  Truffle ketchup was amazing.  Vert sauce was interesting.  Garlic Aoli was a bit too much like pure mayo for my taste.  Soppy joe is a value at $6, but nothing super special unless you love sloppy joes.  I wouldn't order again, because I don't, but wanted to trust the chef.  The burger is, like all reviews, outstanding.  Well worth the $8.  I ordered it well done and it was perfect.  The onion roll is unbelievable.  Just a great burger.  Better than the "st francis" onion burger, which is great in it's own right, from a competing restaurant.  Dessert was donuts (just okay), but with a mexican mousse that was really good.  $5 well worth it.  And the push pop at $5 was also very interesting and worth trying.  Altogether, all the above food was in the ballpark of $65 for two people inlcluding two drinks and tip.  We were stuffed, and had enjoyed creating our own "tasting menu".    We'll absolutely be back for happy hour or even a regular dinner.  Salads seemed nicely sized, so I think I'd try the salad with sand dabs on it as an entree, as the other entrees I saw being served were "tiny" portions.  I'm sure good... but tiny.

Could be contender for my favorite Phoenix restaurant.  Service - 5 Star - and that's hard to earn from me Decor/Environment -3/4 Stars - It's okay, but felt a bit cheap to me compared to it's peers.   Food - 5 star - Everything I ate was good to excellent.  Delightful. Value - 4 star - It's not cheap, but most are reasonable, especially happy hour.  Came here for restaurant week.  Very surprised to love it as much as I did.    Tip:  Happy Hour is outstanding.  $2.50 beers, $5 cocktail of day, $5 wine.  4-5 apps, full size portions, are $5.  My wife ordered the Pate appetizer to start, and it was a generous sized portion of pate.  She loved it.  I ordered the brussel sprouts on grits.  I'm not a huge fan of either ingredient, but this was a knock your socks off good combination.  Very pleased.  We both ordered the chopped salad.  It was just as others describe, very good.  Don't expect a big salad.  I ordered the chicken chimchurri and it was a generous piece of chicken, delightful flavors, and a great spicy kick.  Not too spicy, but just right.  I never order chicken dishes in restaurants, but was glad i tried.  My wife ordered the duck meatloaf and shared with our son.  Both loved it.  Nice portion.  Great flavors especially the grain it was on top of.  I had the bread pudding dessert, and I love bread pudding, but this was the weak point of the entire meal.  Was much more like a thick pie, and while very edible, not great by any means.  My wife got the blonde dessert, and it was excellent.  Says it tasted like great fudge.  Anyway, even with happy hour and restaurant week pricing, it was $60/person with tip.  Lots of food, and very good quality.  Not cheap, but IMO worth it.  We will be back, and would put this on par with St. Francis down the street... both are truly outstanding examples of Phoenix restaurants.

I've been here for dinner and been here for happy hour.    Setting:  5 Star - modern, clean, cool, beautiful - everything you want in a trendy hot restaurant.  Service:  5 Star - nice staff, attentive management, felt welcome  Food:  3-4 Star - Everything is pretty good.  Small portions.  Most things are clearly premade and just reheated, which makes sense for many items.    Value:  2-3 Star - Except on Happy Hour, everything just felt too expensive for the quality of food and quantity.  Not terribly expensive, but just expensive.  It's tapas size portions, which is fine, but when you are paying $8-9 for a tapas size portion, it adds up!   I've been here twice.  First time I ate the regular menu on a daddy-daughter night out, and that was nice.  I enjoyed most things on the menu that I tried.  I had noticed the happy hour menu/prices, and was excited to try.  Second time, came back with two kids and wife for happy hour.    NOTE:  Menu has changed, and is NOT the same as is on their website.  It's more expensive now!  Happy Hour prices seem to have gone up a couple bucks per item.  No longer a great deal, just an okay one.  We ordered beers and mixed drinks.  Tasty all round.  We ordered three orders of the pork soup, which was good but the ramen sure tasted a lot like the stuff you get at a supermarket, even if everything around it was top notch.  All the appetizers were tasty.  Just not outstanding.  So two kids, two adults, two drinks.  $80 with tip.  Filled us up.  My wife, who usually isn't one to be cheap, said:  "That didn't feel like it was worth the $80."  I wavered a bit and would probably agree, but at the same time I didn't feel like it was terrible for what we ate.  Just don't go back thinking happy hour is some amazing deal.    It WAS, then the owner raised prices.   But if you have a very light appetite, I could think of a LOT worse places to go for Happy Hour (which goes till 7) on a date.

For $6+tax, you can get a predesigned pizza.  I've had all of them, and they are all very tasty.  Or $8 and you can add whatever toppings you want.  This is to pizza what Subway is to sandwhiches and Chipotle is to burritos.  Fresh ingredients, rapidly assembled, getting you out the door and eating your food within about 7 minutes of ordering or less.  For a great price.  Is it the BEST pizza in the world?  No.  It's GOOD pizza though, they way you want it, served piping hot/fresh, at an incredible price.  And then enjoy your pizza on the grass of cityscape, or in an outdoor chair, listening to the fountain or people watching.  It's as good as it gets in terms of VALUE.

Ambiance/Setting:  1/2 a star Prices:  3 star Friendliness/Service:  4 star Food:  2 star  Came for lunch, me and the wife.  It's truly a hole in the wall (think convenience store with a small grill and 5 tables), with 6 employees to 2 diners (us).  You order at  the counter, and it is served to you on styrofoam plates and cups, with plastic forks.  The great:  Vegetable Somosas were some of best we've had, anywhere.  2 for $4.  The okay:  Entrees.  Tried a veggie curry and a lamb dish.  Veggie better.  Lamb was very fatty and who knows when cooked (clearly not that day).  Still tasty and very rich sauce that was filling.  Imagine a side salad bowl filled with your entree.  They also serve you a styrofoam plate of rice to put it over.  For $7-9 each, this seemed overpriced.    The terrible:  Naan/breads.  First they are kinda expensive ($2 for a small 7" round piece).  But worse, they PREMADE.  Like not by the restaurant (pulled out of plastic bag).  The piece we got tasted like it had turned/was old.  We spit out our one bite and left it untouched (this never, ever happens with us... it's like raptors feeding normally).  Everyone is very friendly though.  And it's one of those places that you therefore really wanted to love.  Verdict / Tips:  TAKEOUT.  Seriously.  And whatever you do don't get the bread.   I would seriously consider 4 somosas (2 orders), plus 1 entree, and share between two people for lunch or lighter dinner.  I work a few blocks away.  I'm really not sure I will be back, but if I did I would order just samosas and veggie dishes for takeout only.
