My Fiance and I went to Sacco's on a half off day.. We are new to the area and and wanted to try something new. We were advised that there would be a 30+ minute wait, they ask for your number to call you when your table is ready. I noticed after 15 minutes more people started to arrive and they were being seated before my fiance and I.Moments later a hostess comes outside and ask a new group of individuals if they would like something to drink after she had come out 2 additional times I guess she felt obligated to see if we were thirsty.Now 30 plus minutes later more people are called before us and I was thinking maybe that had reservations...No I go to the hostess and advised her that several people have been seated before us she acted as if she was oblivious to was I was talking about and I asked her to repeat the number that was given...She typed in the wrong number and said that she hadn't called us anyway but of course she didn't because she didn't have the correct number. Finally we were seated BBQ pizza was horrible wings were flavorless and the table was fit for 2 very small people. I have had pizza from around the valley and this was not in the top 10.
