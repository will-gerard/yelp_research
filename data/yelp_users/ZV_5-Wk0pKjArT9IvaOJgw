Love this place - the people are fun (techy!) and focused on service.  I have had both personal and business experiences here and they knock it out of the park, always!  If you are looking for a special occasion or large bulk job, Brand X will handle it for you!

This is a review of Living Spaces customer service line.  I reached out to the 877-266-7300 to be transferred to the store directly.  The customer service representative that fielded my call today - stated that was not possible.  As I was inquiring whether a sectional was still available on the floor that was a return and did not want to drive from southeast Gilbert to N. Scottsdale to find out. The customer service rep again stated that trasferring me to the store direction was not possible....CRAZY - as just 2 weeks ago I was transferred to the store and spoke to one of the interior designers on the same peice.  This is how i learned that hte returned item being sold - would not carry Living Spaces warrenty on frame, craftmanship etc.  I was still hoping to purchase this peice - but, the customer service rep at 877-266-7300 would not allow that.  Disappointed...
