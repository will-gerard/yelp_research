It had been years since I had been to Carlos O'Briens and last night was a reminder why it had been so long. The wait was short..we were seated right away and before we even settled into the booth we had our water with our chips and salsa. The waitress was pleasant and refilled our beverages, the restrooms clean.   So why do you say, "Only 2 stars?" The food..where to begin about the food. Our meal started on such a high note, the chips were hot and the salsa fresh..that is where the high notes end. My pollo fundido was extremely dry with chicken that tasted like it had been boiled with absolutely no seasoning..no salt, no pepper..nothing. The jalapeno cream sauce was good and the dish had plenty of melted cheese, but all of that unseasoned chicken just made it so very unappealing. The beans  had a good flavor but they looked like they had been under a heat lamp for a while, all of that gooey melted cheese couldn't hide the hard, dry crust that had formed on top. And the rice....I will just leave it at that, rice  The husband had a shredded beef enchilada & taco combo. He ate the enchilada, said it was ok, but the taco..again, boiled, unseasoned meat, which he left on the plate. The child had a grilled cheese sandwich. Really over toasted bread with unmelted cheese, how can you mess up a 4 year olds grilled cheese?   Carlos O'Brien has the potential to be a great mexican restaurant. It's affordable, the restaurant is clean and they are in an area with not a whole lot of dining options (maybe that is why they have been a round for so long) but unless they take a little more pride in the actual food..I don't think in this econony they might not make it.

Debated about taking my son here for some time before actually getting his hair cut..Both him and I love this place now. It's the only place he wants to get his hair cut. It's a little pricey for a childs cut, but well worth it, and they have a rewards card so we get coupons every couple of months for money off or special offers. The kids love the games and movies they can play and all of the stylists do a pretty good job. I recommend making an appointment so you don't have to wait. And we love Miss Veronica, she always gives a great haircut!

I have been going to this Uncle Sam's location prior to the Peoria & Scottsdale locations ever opening and I have to say, the food at this location is heads and tales above the other 2. We are closer to the Peoria location but the service and food are hit or miss, always.   Now on to the Shea location. Hmmm, the food, hot, cheesy, greasy, fried goodness. You can't go wrong with the cheesesteak, order it with fried onions and a mix of the vinegary hot peppers and the briny sweet peppers..they have a 1/4 of a sandwich on the bail out menu but order the half or whole to take home for the next day..even better.  Beer battered onion rings are top notch as are the breaded fried zucchini. Both come with bangin' ranch, we always need more.  I am not a big fan of their pizza, but the calzone, that's another story. Awesome cheesy, saucy goodness. When I'm in the mood for a cold sandwich I always go with the Italian Supreme, but if you are ordering to go and you get the cold sandwich ask for the italian dressing on the side, you will end up with a soggy mess. A tasty mess, but still a mess.  The only reason that I don't give the Shea Uncle Sam's a 5 star rating is they only serve Pepsi products and I am a big, big Coke drinker, rather die of thirst than drink a Pepsi sort of thing..they do have great ice tea though, just ask for extra lemon if it's your forte'.

I have been going to Uncle Sam's for probably 20+ years and I have always thought the food was well above average, that was until today.  My husband, son and I stopped in for lunch around 1:00.  I ordered 1/4 cheesesteak with a small fry, son ordered the kid's pepperoni pizza, husband ordered the 1/2 Italian sub. Server came over quickly and took our drink order, which was brought out within a bout 5 minutes. There were 3 other occupied tables, more staff than customers.  Finally getting our order my sandwich was ice cold, not even a smidge of heat. Husbands sandwich looked good, toppings fresh. Kids pizza was hot but really looked like the frozen Red Baron personal pizzas he eats at home, he didn't eat it.  Ate half of my husbands sandwich. For the 1st time in my life I sent my food back.  When the waitress brought out a replacement..with attitude, she had to inform us that she was a vegan and didn't touch meat...ever it was steaming and looked like a Uncle Sam's cheesesteak.  One bite told me otherwise.  The sandwich had absolutely no flavor, nothing.  No cheese taste, no onion taste. Meat was it, meat with no salt, no pepper.  Meat. I have loved this place for ever, I will probably give the Peoria location a chance since it's closer to our home, but Shea we won't be back!

I have been to South Bank about half a dozen times now and this little hole is the wall is great for lunch. It's a little gem In an industrial area with not a lot of dining choices sans the JITB down the street.   The service is always quick and pleasant, prices reasonable, generous portion sizes and above average food. The Chipotle Steak Sandwich is the bomb! I also like the Albuquerque Turkey Sandwich. All sandwiches/entrees come with a side choice, the normal prefab frozen fries (always served hot), coleslaw, cottage cheese, etc. Daily lunch specials like Italian Beef Sandwiches and Friday Fish Fry are both excellent choices. A co-worker recently had the shrimp basket and she ate everything, fries, coleslaw and the huge breaded shrimp, said she would be ordering it again.   They have happy hour and televise UFC fights but I can't vouch for either.   If you work in the area give them a try for lunch it's a great little family run, neighborhood business serving good food.

Stopped in at Lo-Lo's after Disney on Ice about a week ago. We arrived on a Saturday night about 6 and to our surprise the place wasn't crowded..actually got a parking place right in front. When we walked in a woman yelled sit any where..then someone else yelled..y'all have to wait. so we waited..and waited. Mind you that several tables in plain view were available. After we were seated..without menus, we waited another 10 minutes before someone came back to the table with our menus..we didn't really need the menus for we have been to Lo-Lo's several times. Waited another 15 minutes for someone to take our order..a Betty Boop, a Tre Tre, a plain waffle for the child, 1 sweet tea, 1 unsweeted tea, 1 red kool-aid. Took another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  Again..not busy. The waitress brought out the Tre Tre and Betty Boop but not the waffle for our son..had to wait another 10 minutes to flag someone down to bring his waffle..long story short, the chicken and waffles were amazing as always, but the unsweeted tea was on the verge of souring..and the service was just plain awful. Lo-Lo's gets extremely buzy, especially on Sunday mornings and we have never had a problem, maybe it was an off night..but for the life of me I don't understand why it took us almost 2 hours for 3 pieces of fried chicken and 3 waffles.

Oh Sardella's how I love you. This is the only pizza we ever eat. The crust, sauce and cheese are a perfect  harmony. We always get delivery and when the pizza arrives it's always fresh,hot and gooey. The Gold Fever wings are awesome a honey mustard with a kick. Honey BBQ is great too. It is a little on the pricey side though..for delivery of a large pepperoni, xtra cheese and 20 wings its about $30. They do charge a small delivery fee, I think it's $2.50. If you don't want to cook, order Sardella's.

I used to go here years ago with co-workers but one them  had a very unpleasant experience that I won't go into detail with so I had stopped frequenting, I moved away from the area and hadn't thought about it in years.   About a year ago a friend mentioned going there back in the day so we thought we would give them another shot.  In the past year I have been back about a half a dozen times when I'm in the area and they have never given me a bad meal.  Don't be intimidated by the building. It looks a little run down from the outside and there usually aren't many cars in the parking lot. Let it be everyone else's loss, not yours. Don't judge a book by it's cover.  The lunch specials are between $5.99 & $6.99, most being $5.99 unless it has some sort of seafood. Combos come with egg drop soup loaded with crunchy veggies and chicken pieces. What chinese place  puts chicken in their egg drop soup? It is probably the best I have ever had..ever! 2 fried won tons, a egg roll and fried rice. The portions are huge.  The service is always quick and pleasant and everything is made to order.  Ask for your drink in a to go cup..especially the iced tea. I can't get enough of it.  If you get the urge for chinese and you are around the Desert Sky area stop in and give them a shot. You won't be sorry.

Met 2 friends here for lunch and the place just keeps getting better. The hot and sour soup was amazing. Filled with lots of roast pork, shrimp, tofu and veggies with the perfect amount of spice. I just wish I lived closer. The prices have gone up a bit, but $5.99 & $6.99 is still a bargin for the quality and quantity of food.

We have been wanting to try the "new and improved" Lenny's for a while now. Having a lazy, relaxing Saturday we decided to give them a try. You order at the counter, take a seat and they bring your order out for you. The new diner style joint is clean and efficient with self serve Pepsi machines, which is kind of a  negative for us..we are a Coke only family, but hey they have Dr. Pepper and ice tea, sweet & unsweetened for non-Pepsi drinkers.  I ordered a #1 Ranch style with cheese (a single patty burger with lettuce, tomato, onion and mayo..lots of mayo), the husband ordered #2 (double patty)  Ranch style with bacon & cheese, no tomato, the child ordered a hot dog with ketchup.   Food came out fast and hot. The burger was...well ok. Not great, not bad either, the cheese was melted and gooey which is a plus and they use red onion and Aunt Hattie's buns..another plus. Fries are frozen variety with the addition of a seasoned salt, I like greasy fries and these weren't, not a bad thing to most though. The all beef hot dog was average size on a very fresh seeded bun.   This Lenny's has a lot to offer for someone on a budget. They sell ice cream too, but we found it a little over priced unlike the burgers and dogs. Dinner for 3 was around $18..not bad. Food was good and we would definately go again some day, but nothing really wowed. Next time I want to order one of the specialty burgers like the Mexican or Cowboy. I don't like that they charge $.30 for a very small cup if you want actual Ranch for the burger or fries..the same price if you want cheese sauce.  I also didn't like the fact that you have to have a key to use the restroom but there isn't a sign to state it, only a sign that says "restrooms for customers only"..if a kind lady wouldn't have approached me and told me I needed a key I probably would still be standing there thinking someone was taking a very, very long time.

Working on the Phoenix / Tempe border restaurants that deliver are few and far between, unless you want a sandwich. My co-workers and I have been ordering Mr. Hunan for about a year now and I have to say we have never received a bad meal.   Delivery is always fast and the older delivery driver is always pleasant, recently they started adding a $1 delivery fee per order, but when your meal is under $6 the buck won't kill you, especially if several in your office is ordering.  The delivery lunch combos come with white or fried rice and your choice of an egg roll or a canned soda and of course a fortune cookie. Portions are pretty large..enough for most of us to have left overs the next day and the choices are a plenty. If you order the sweet and sour chicken the sauce comes on the side so your crispy chicken doesn't get soggy. The garlic chicken is spicy and has a wonderful lingering garlic sauce that mysteriously is hotter the next day.  For the previous reviews about the cleanliness of the restaurant I can't comment on for I have only had delivery and just based on the food we order (at least twice a month) I have to give Mr. Hunan's four stars. Is it great, no but it's very good and a super value for the dollar.

Mr. Hunan why did you have to fail me? Were to begin. The office I work in has been ordering delivery from Mr. Hunan for years, but the last couple of times we have ordered it has taken forever, not just longer than normal, more like one & a half hours for delivery. I'm sorry if I order lunch at 11:00, I'm not expecting to eat it 12:30 and if it's going to take that long please don't tell me it will be there in a half hour, and to make matters worse we try to call and there isn't any answer...at all...for like 30 minutes calling every 10 seconds..... Anyway, we order 4 lunch specials for delivery on a Thursday afternoon for a co-workers birthday. I ordered the Chicken Lo Mein, big mistake. The chicken was cut in paper thin pieces, but that wasn't the problem. The problem was the chicken and noodles had absolutely no flavor. It tasted like boiled noodles and chicken..meh. The rice was fresh but again not a whole lot of flavor! The birthday girls Sesame Chicken was all breading and the egg roll looked like it had been re-fried. Another co-worker had the bourbon chicken, she said her's was just "ok" and the fourth had Cashew Chicken, again just "ok". Mr. Hunan was always our go to place for chinese but after being let down on food and service we probably are going to scratch it from our list.

I had been waiting to try PSC after reading they had Pennsylvania  Dutch Birch Beer and Tasty Kakes. My parents are from South Jersey and those 2 things were staples in our diet when vacationing at the Shore every summer.   So after begging my husband to drive the 23 mile one-way trip from Glendale to Scottsdale we arrive to find a small hole in the wall that could have used a good scrubbing, but you can't judge a book by it's cover, right?   After standing at the counter for several minutes a stoned twenty something says, "what's up?" to my husband, asks if we are ready to order, when we reply yes, he slowly turns around and starts putting lids on what looks like ranch dressing. Rude. That should have been our 1st clue to turn and run the 2nd was NO BIRCH BEER. Sorry we don't have any we were told.   After finally taking our order, 1 cheesesteak hoagie, 1 cheesesteak wiz wit with a side of cherry peppers and 1 cheese fry we proceed to wait, outside in 114 degree weather for the counter was occupied by 4 college age kids shooting the breeze with another employee.   When we finally got our food we had to wait another 5 minutes to get our drinks for the stoned counter boy "forgot" them. I can't place what your order was can you help me out? Seriously. We were the only ones eating..the job doesn't take a college degree, if you can't remember 2 Cokes and 1 Mr. Pibb you have some serious issues, maybe this should be your indication to lay off the weed or whatever substance was polluting your mind.  The food. The fries are fresh cut or they were at sometime or place and had a ton of cheese, but it's like they had been sitting the 10 minutes before we got our sandwiches. They were cold and soggy. If they would have been hot and crisp those gooey fries would have been worth the drive. The sandwiches. I would give them 3 stars. I've had better, but I've had worse. Lots of cheese and onion just the way I like them. The bread was pretty good and the sandwich it self had enough meat to satisfy.  I can't lie the sandwich had a good taste so did the fries, but nothing was really hot and the customer service experience in addition to no Birch Beer really left us flat.   I really wanted to enjoy PSC, I really wanted a Birch Beer and a great steak but unfortunately I didn't get either.

The pros:  The staff, all were pleasant and friendly. The food, everything we ordered was tasty, prices were average for a resort. Cleanliness, our room was above average clean.  The cons: The parking. There is only one word to describe it! Ridiculous. The amenities, pool was overcrowded and they charge you to use it. The ice machine on our floor didn't work the 3 days we were there and the machines are only on every other floor. Housekeeping; even though our room was clean when we arrived we asked to not have the room cleaned only to have fresh towels during our stay. while we were at dinner...dinner someone entered our room and made the beds. Dining choices. Really only the Cascades Cafe is geared towards families.   Our stay was enjoyable enough, but with all the hidden charges, the hassle of parking and getting around (they do offer shuttle, but again more tip money) and the limited dining choices we probably won't return. Unless you want to stay at the resort nothing is within walking distance and with a young child we were pretty much prisoners in our room after dark.

First I have to say I never, ever thought that I would be writing a review for of all things a Brazilian wax, but here I am.   I have been going to Denise for quite some time now and she is a total pro and a perfectionist. She made the whole process feel natural and not-so-awkward and trust me the first time is very awkward, but she is so great she quickly put me at ease. After all its not every day you let some stranger see your who-who.   Is it painless?..not quite but its not as bad as most make it seem. I guess it's like a tattoo..pain is all in the beholder. Back to Denise, she is very, very reasonable. I can get waxed top to bottom along with my eyebrows with a tip for less than $60 and she's quick. The salon is clean and inviting with a mix of clientele.   I also recently had my hair cut by Lydia. I had tried a salon that came highly recommended on Yelp and literally walked out with a modified mullet & $90 poorer! I had minor surgery about a year ago and the result was my hair falling out. A little reluctant but in dire need of a hair cut I thought I would give this salon a try. I am so glad I did. Lydia was honest in telling me that since the hair loss no matter what she did she couldn't give me the babe-a-lious hair that I desired. What she gave me was hair that looked so much fuller, healthier and manageable again for more than half the cost of the salon that came highly recommend!  I give Clipology five stars..which I don't do very often but these ladies are awesome and would recommend them in a heart beat.

Recently went back to Lydia for a "style" this time. We decided to go the short route..so, so glad I did. The haircut she gave me is probably one of the best haircuts I have ever had...ever! It works with my texture and thickness of my hair and literally takes me about 10 minutes in the morning to style. Since cutting me about a month a go I haven't had a bad hair day! Thanks Clipology and Lydia!

My husband and I have been to this Black Angus about half a dozen times in the past year. The service is always excellent but the food has been hit or miss. It was a Friday night and he was craving a burger, but not the normal fast food burger, I wasn't. So we decided on Black Angus, close to the house and they have a kids menu.    It was about 6 and the restaurant was not busy, no wait..on a Friday..made us think here we go again..The hostess sat us quickly and the server said he would be right back, waited about 5 minutes and he came back to take our drink order. When he brings our drinks we order our entrees' the Steakhouse Burger, fries & garden salad for the hubs, 6 oz filet, loaded baked & garden salad for me, the child decided he wanted mac & cheese. Salads arrived quickly with the complimentary loaf of bread.  Salads were nothing to write home about but the bread was hot and fresh baked. Entrees' arrived shortly after. Husbands burger looked awesome and he said it tasted great. The fries were the average frozen type. My steak was cooked to perfection, hot and pink on the inside with the right amount of seasoning. The potato was picture perfect but could have used a tad more butter, the meal as a whole will get no complaints from me. The child's mac & cheese was classic Kraft's, he ate it eagerly waiting to get that sundae that comes with each kid's meal.   The service was outstanding, we never had dirty dishes nor did our  beverages run dry. Our waiter was polite and made conversation. The food was above average.   If Black Angus could nail it every time like they did on the last visit it would be a favorite on our list.

This review is for the bakery only! My son wanted a Minecraft themed birthday party, not just any Minecraft party. A pink mustached sheep party. After being told they couldn't make the cake he was wanting at several other grocery bakeries Albertsons was my last resort. I was assured that what he wanted wouldn't be a problem. I have to admit I was a little skeptical! The bakery in this store is small and sometimes the selection isn't very good. Imagine our surprise when we picked up the cake the day of the party. She nailed it. Not only was the cake picture perfect, the Bavarian Cream filling was awesome and the cake moist and fluffy. The best part it was only $25. I think this is the first time we have never had any cake leftovers and the black frosting didn't make everyone's lips and teeth stained.  I never really shop at this store unless I need something quick or they are having a great sale but from now on this will be my go to for all baked goods.

We recently used the Radisson to host our small wedding. The hotel is very hard to find behind a Holiday Inn with a very small dark sign on the corner. Parking is a bit tight, for some strange reason half of the parking garage is roped off, but once we actually made it into the property we had a very pleasant stay. We arrived late in the evening and had a fast, pleasant check in.   The hotel  comp'd us a 1 bedroom suite. The suite had 1 king bedroom with a small sitting room with a  microwave and a small refrigerator.  Small but clean, updated and efficient. Our guests that wanted to stay received a special $59 rate..great for the time of year. The landscaping was great perfect for our garden wedding ceremony that isn't really showcased on the website.  The ground level pool is small but has a wonderful waterfall, the roof top pool is nothing special but there wasn't anyone there so if you are looking for privacy it's the place to be. Children's play area next to ground level pool.  There is an adult book store  across the street, but we did not feel unsafe walking to the drug store around the corner after dark. Nice restaurant and outside dining patio on site..a little pricey though.   Free use of computer with internet access in the lobby.  The hotel and catering staff were all very accommodating. the food was decent and affordable.   We would definitely use the Radisson again or recommend to out of town visitors.

Stayed here again because of the convenience to the light rail. My husband and I along with 2 friends had tickets to the George Strait concert and wanted to not have to fight traffic so we chose the Radisson. Check in was a breeze and the front desk clerk upgraded our rooms to Cabana suites...free of charge. Once again the room was extremely clean and had been recently updated. Brian down in the bar was great for happy hour..and he has a heavy pour. Check out the happy hour specials, they have a list of specialty martinis for $5. We love this location, sure it's off the beaten path and across the street from an adult bookstore but everyone is always friendly and pleasant and the property is taken care of and the best part it's 2 blocks from a light rail station. Catch it and enjoy a concert or sporting event downtown without the hassle or cost of parking.

I have been to Arcadia Tavern several times. Everytime I have been the food has been extremely good.  First time around I had the Tavern Grilled Cheese with tots. Sandwich was really nothing special, but it was grilled perfectly and the tots crunchy, crispy and not greasy. I will give that meal a C+.  Second time was for Happy Hour with some co-workers. My husband and I only had cocktails but several others ordered food. Service was very slow for drinks and food, she was nice just not on top of it. Food ordered was Spinach & Artichoke dip and Hummus & Pitas and a Tavern Burger. Food was well prepared and presentation was spot on and with a $5-$6 price tag you can't go wrong. As for the cocktails, I think $9-$12 for a martini or margarita during Happy Hour is a little overpriced.  Third time was for lunch @ about 11 on a Friday afternoon. We (4 co-workers and myself) decided to order the Salted Pretzel with Roasted Pepper Cheese...OMG. That warm soft pretzel was amazing. I literally could have eaten both of the pretzels that come with an order and died a happy woman. The cheese sauce was good but it kinda reminded me of chili cheese. For my entree I had the Phoenix Philly with Sweet Tots. The taste was wonderful, the perfect amount of spice. My complaint was the sandwich was dry and could have used a touch more shaved prime rib and a little more cheese would have made up for the dryness. The sweets tots could have been left to fry a touch more for they were not crisp enouch for my liking, but again the taste was great.  Co-workers had burgers, Hangover and Rocky Point. All said they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Waitress was nice and got our order correct. The bus boy was great, we never had a dirty dish and he is the one that actually brought our food, both the pretzel and sandwiches.  My only real complaint about Arcadia Tavern is the womens restroom. Why would you only have 1 stall? And why would you have in next to the kids area? All of those kids line up in front of the door to wait their turn to play the free video games and the door sticks, I kept thinking I was going to knock some kid out everytime I opened the door. It's Happy Hour, with beer and with beer comes...well you know. Which does bring me to another complaint. I know they have a small restaurant area separate from the bar, but come on it's still a bar. People are drinking and with drunk people comes an atmosphere I really don't want my kid in.  Prices for food are competitive and the quality is good, for 5 entrees, a appetizer and non-alcoholic beverages our total was $80.   Get the pretzel for Happy Hour its only $5..so, so worth it!

I was so excited to try Hillside after rave reviews from my boss so when he suggested he take all of us to lunch there for Administrative Assistant Day several of us anxiously accepted.   Got there about 11:30 on a Thursday, 3 tables outside and about half of the tables inside were occupied. Food being prepared looked awesome. Following directions the 7 of  us sat ourselves in the back at a long table. A very nice waiter came over gave us menus and took our drink orders. It literally took 15 minutes to get our drinks and to have our order taken. I ordered the turkey sandwich with a side of fries. After ordering it took another 45 minutes to receive our food. My sandwich and fries looked great. Quality ingredients prepared with care. To my surprise my fries..ice cold, not  luke warm, but cold like when you go to throw away the McDonald's bag and there is one elusive fry that has tried to escape, and you know its not going to be that salty, crunchy, greasy, hot fry you want but you have to eat it anyway and then regret it. It was that type of cold. The bread on the sandwich had been sitting out so long it felt like it had been toasted, but it hadn't. It was such a shame too because the turkey was flavorful and the lettuce, tomato and avocado so fresh. Honestly though, I have had a better turkey sandwich at QT for $5 and it came with chips and a drink.  A co-worker ordered the Chilaquiles Verde and hers was so cold the cheese had congealed and the yolk on fried egg on top had started dry out, . My boss asked if she wanted to send it back but since we had already been there over an hour she said no.  Someone else ordered the Mesquite Rotisserie Chicken, he said it looked better than it tasted.  Our waiter even though nice but way over worked..they looked a little short staffed. He was working all of the outside tables plus several inside and the flow of the cafe just didn't look like it worked. We never received refills on our drinks and my pricky pear ice tea was the high spot of my experience.  Hillside uses quality ingredients and maybe I just visited on a off day, but from what I had today I won't be returning.

I really wanted to like this place. The cupcakes are a work of art to look at..beautiful. They call your name to buy one. Was at Arrowhead recently shopping with my Mother I had heard about this place from several sources..some good, some bad. We stopped in and had to wait a while to be served. A young male wearing purple nail polish and another male frosting cupcakes were deep in conversation and took both of them a while to notice us..nail polish man was apologetic and proceeded to take our order.    We bought 4 cupcakes because we couldn't decide..a pineapple express, a peanut butter cup, a baked apple and a vanilla signature.  When arriving home we couldn't wait to try the picture perfect specimens before us..we cut each one in half so each of us could sample all. The best of the bunch was the baked apple. Cake was semi-moist and flavorful, but that frosting, ugh. So sweet and so plentiful and not in a good way. The others were dry and crumbly with that sicking sweet frosting. Needless to say after both of us taking a bite of each flavor we proceeded to throw them in the trash. If you want a cupcake that looks great but tastes..meh this is the place for you.

Found this place by chance for my normal salon didn't open until 11 and was on a time crunch..hidden on the side of a Fry's Marketplace@ 35th Ave & Peoria.   At first I was a little hesitant, they open @ 10 on Sundays and I arrived at about 10:45 to find the shop empty, occupied by only 2 nail techs. I asked for a pedicure with french tip. The pedicure was $18, which is average, but the french tip was $5 extra..my normal salon only charges $3.   The place was very clean, with a inviting atmosphere. I loved the beach inspired mural.   My only complaint was it took the woman 1 hour to give me a pedicure..but she did awesome with removing my calluses and made my fat little toes look normal.  I believe I now have a new place that is closer to home.   If you are looking for a pedi this is the place.

I have been going to this salon for all of my nail needs for about 8 months now and I have to say they have never done me wrong. When I pay the extra $5 for the callus removal it is well worth it, the heels are always smooth and callus free. They are always pleasant and don't talk to each other in another language. The salon is extremely clean and they never fail to ask me if I want a bottle of water. Good job ladies. You keep me coming back!

Wasn't sure what to expect from this place. Hot dogs and fruit really doesn't sound to appetizing..especially with mustard. The building itself is a little run down looking and the menu on the drive thru is hand written. Once inside it's..well, cute.   I assume the gentleman wearing the hawaiian shirt taking the orders is the owner. The customer service in this place is worth the 5 stars. He answered all of our questions with patience, gave suggestions and was just all around pleasant.   The food after being ordered only took about 4 minutes to get. We ordered the Island Brat, small tater tots, a small coleslaw, a small lizard sunset & a small cherry hawaiian ice. The brat was good, not great, but the toppings were awesome! The pineapple-coconut topping was tasty as was the maui mustard..I don't like mustard, but this was spicy and sweet, perfect with the brat. The hawaiian ice was great. We were asked if we wanted it on "crack"?  Crack was sweetened condensed milk squirted on top! The star of the order were the tater tots! Hot, crispy and well seasoned!   The customer service and the tater tots are enough for the 5 stars because it doesn't get any better than that. The coleslaw...eh a little bland with not much flavor but sweetness, but it gave texture to my meal..except for those tasty, crispy, crunchy tots, they gave lots of texture. Did I mention how good the tater tots were?   My only complaint was I smelled like grease when I got back to the office..but on a good note it was a constant reminder of just how good those tots were. If in the area or for a quick lunch during the week, it's a keeper on my list.

Heard through the grapevine that this local business is financially struggling and may close shop. If you love hot dogs please try Maui Dog and help a local business out. The food is good and the customer service is outstanding!

Found this cute little shop doing a google search trying to find cupcakes for our wedding. Glad I did. Several unique flavor combinations to choose from. The chocolate cake peanut butter cream was awesome so was the peppermint patti but I have to say my favorite was chocolate cake, chocolate butter cream filled with cinnamon cream and I'm really not a fan of chocolate cake, until now. They also have a menu with several creative sandwiches, next time I have to try the twisted crab..made with a pretzel. If you are ever around the Dysart and Western area in Old Town Avondale stop by for a sugar fix..it will be worth it.

The company that manages the office building I work in recently started having various food trucks in the parking lot at lunch 2 times a week. Today was Pizza People, several co-workers and I decided to give into the food truck sensation and give them a try and let me tell you, we all are sold.  They use fresh, local ingredients and everything is made to order..which means expect to wait about 10 minutes to get your food..not the everyday roach coach food either.    I ordered the Popeye with the addition of bacon..OMG. This was probably one of the best pizzas I have eaten. The crust was everything it should be. Golden brown with a crispy but yet chewy crust that had that faint taste of yeast that I love. The only thing I could find wrong with my pie was that after several minutes it started to get soggy on the thinner pieces of crust. I really wish that ricotta cheese was a topping option too.  My only regret is that I didn't pay the extra $1.50 and combo it up with a small chopped salad & a drink..next time my friends, next time.

We vacation in New Jersey and love Mister Softee. When we found out they had a franchise truck here in AZ we knew we had to book for our son's birthday. What a hit. They arrived a few minutes ahead of the scheduled time..that was a plus. He was friendly and had great product and customer service. Everyone from the youngest to the oldest enjoyed having a cold soft serve ice cream on a hot day. My son also received a Mister Softee shirt and replica truck bank that he absolutely loved.  I highly recommend Mister Softee to anyone that is throwing a childs birthday..heck I already told my husband that I don't want a gift for my birthday this year. I want a visit from Mister Softee.

After having some issues with my normal salon I decided it was time to start my search for a new one. I choose 3D Nails based solely on it's location.   Arrived about 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon to find the place sold out. I was told it would probably be about 15 minutes so I opted to wait. It's very small with 4 techs working. While waiting I browsed the polish selection, which is extensive, they even have the new magnetic polishs and a large selection of gel polishes. After about 5 minutes they had a pedicure chair open so I started my soak. And I soaked, and soaked. Finally 20 minutes or so later my tech started my classic pedi.  She filed them just as I like square. I have had issues with several places not knowing what square means. Even though they were very busy I didn't feel she rushed and actually did a really good job for $18. I loved the fact that their basic pedicure comes with a sugar scrub. My normal place of 2 years charged extra for it. Not here it's included.   After polishing she asked if I wanted a flower and I said "no" but could she do zebra stripes on just my big toes. She didn't understand and had to ask another tech. I didn't really get what I had in mind but it has started to grow on me and I love the colors.  3D Nails might just be my new go to nail salon. Next time I will upgrade to the deluxe pedicure. If the cheap $18 one includes the sugar scrub I am curious what the $25 one includes. Based on my 1 experience I would recommend 3D Nails.

I have been going to 3D Nails now for about 2 months, going faithfully every 2 weeks. I love, love, love this place. I received a punch card on my 2nd visit that will give me $10 off any service on my 7th visit. And right now they have 10% of all services for their Grand Opening. I recently found out that they took over ownership in April. On my last visit I had a deluxe pedicure (regular pedi with callus removal, sugar scrub, cucumber heel therapy lotion, & hot stone massage) and a gel manicure for only $53..and I had french tip on both, that alone at my "old" salon would have set me back $10 bucks. It's usually busy so either make an appointment or be prepared to wait. Bihn is just wonderful. He knows exactly want after I tell him.

I continue to love this place and the service just keeps getting better. Now if you pay cash they give you an additional 10% off. And they rock with the nail art. My toes have never looked better.

We usually have had great luck with NextCare facilities but this time not so much! My husband was sick and our normal PCP was on vacation and from previous experience we knew NextCare was a great alternative. Checked in online so we would not have to wait. After checking in we waited approximately 10 minutes, great right? My husband was literally in the back not more than 5 minutes. You have a common cold the PA said, just get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluid. Home we go. 3 days later he goes back. I think I have a sinus infection he tells them. The PA confirms, yes you do and it looks like it's turned into a upper respiratory infection too. From having sinus infections in the past he asked for an antibiotic. Long story short they proceed to give him a shot of steroids, a prescription for another steroid and Flonaze, refusing to prescribe the much needed antibiotic. Two days later the sinus infection has gotten worse and he is not getting any better. We call, can you please call in a antibiotic to our pharmacy? Nope you will need to return yet a 3rd time and even then we can't guarantee we will prescribe an antibiotic. Now I get if he as asking for pain meds or some sort of narcotic, but he is not and they can clearly see he has progressively gotten worse over the course of 5 days. Are they just trying to milk our insurance, are you hurting for business that bad?  We will not be back to NextCare, which is a shame because the need for non emergency care when you can't get to the doctor is not only a necessity but convenient. Don't waste your time or money, I recommend you go to the Minute Clinics in Fry's or Take Care Clinics inside Walgreens.  Since NextCare took the time to "comment" I have decided to take the time and update my review.  Bill's solution was to contact the patient liaison, which we did after each passing day my husband continued to have more severe  symptoms.  They were absolutely no help what so ever.  We under stand that doctors do not want to prescribe antibiotics for every sniff and sneeze, but he was sick, clearly sick to even someone that didn't have a "trained" eye.  We ended up going to The Little Clinic inside Fry's at 43rd Ave & Cactus.  Not only did he have the confirmed upper respiratory and sinus infections but by this time he also had a ear infection.  We won't be going back to NextCare regardless of how much ass kissing they do...Ever!  And I suggest if you are reading this to not use them either.  It will be a waste of money or insurance dollars.  Go else where.

The family tried Shorty's today for lunch.  There are some pros and cons.   The Pros. 1. The place is really clean and cutely decorated situated in a old Whataburger building. The place is decorated with a hot rod theme. They even have a hot rod parked on the front lawn. 2. The lady behind the counter was pleasant and helpful when answering questions. 3. All of the food is cooked to order. Everything was hot and fresh. My husband said his single burger with cheese was good and he would definately order the double next time. My onion rings had great flavor but some were crispy and others not so much. My child ate all of his single slider so I would say it's a thumbs up there. 4. The food came out quickly.  The Cons. 1. We found it a little on the pricey side. The single steakburger was $3.09 plus the $.50 for cheese.  2. I was kinda of irritated that after paying $2.49 for a small basket of onion rings I had to pay another $.50 if I wanted ranch to dip them in. They only come with ketchup. 3.They charge $.50 if you want a refill on your drinks. Drink station is behind the counter. 4. Restrooms are outside. (that is no fault of theirs though so no stars deducted.) 5. No combo meals. If my husband wanted fries with his burger it would have been another $1.89. With the addition of a drink (medium $1.79) it would have made $7.17 for a single combo without tax.  We liked Shorty's and will more than likely make another go of it. On a Saturday about 11:30 they had a steady stream of mostly to go orders. Drive thru is a great convenience too. We hope Shorty's survives in this economy, a great local run business, but they might want to change a few things to make it a little more economical.

Buzznbeez was at our office building today and the menu was too inticing and diverse to pass up.   I ordered the fried chicken with mac & cheese. The fried chicken wings were perfectly fried. The skin was crisp and the meat on the inside was still moist. No complaints. The 7 cheese mac and cheese had a really good taste but wasn't hot enough or gooey enough for me. I'm not much of a dry mac and cheese girl. The portion size was perfect and the price reasonable.  A co-worker ordered the spicy teriyaki chicken with slaw over rice. Her dish smelled wonderful and again a really good portion size. She said it tasted good but it was really spicy, too spicy for her.  Last co-worker ordered the BBQ combo, it came with a hot link, chicken, a roll and 1 side. (she also choose the mac & cheese). She said everything again had great taste but the BBQ sauce that was heavy handed wasn't warm and it made the food cold.  Even with a few hiccups we all enjoyed our lunch and would definately order from them again when making the rounds. The food was fresh and the service was friendly and fast.

The management company that manages the office building I work in has been arranging for a different food truck to come out during lunch hours the last couple of weeks. I have tried them all and haven't been disappointed yet..and today wasn't an exception.  We started out with samples of brisket and pulled pork topped with slaw. I have to say the brisket was one of the best I have ever, ever had. It was juicy and tender with a hint of smoke, just the way I like it. The sauce was sweet & spicy. The slaw on the pork was fresh with the addition of sweet red peppers and green onions, the dressing had a little bit of a kick.   Torn, I opted for the pulled pork nachos, the thought and concept was a little foreign to me at first but they intrigued me. Where to start. The thick corn chips were freshly fried, nothing bagged about these chips. The cheese sauce was pretty standard gooey cheese. The pork was flavorful and the fresh tomato chucks and green onions where a nice touch. My only complaint was that they had a little too much BBQ sauce on them for my liking. The chips stayed crisp and firm even the ones on the bottom. Highly recommend.  A co-worker had the pulled pork sandwich combo. The sandwich was served on a fresh hot dog style bun, which we found a little odd, but after much thought we came to the conclusion that if the sandwich would have been on a regular round roll it would not have been so easy to eat. It came with seasoned fries, which she said more than likely came frozen and could have been left in the fryer just a touch longer. She enjoyed the meat & slaw and said she would order it again.  Another co-worker had the 2 pork tacos. Basically the same as the sandwich only served on 2 awesome homemade corn tortillas. She loved it. We all loved our meals and  the value was great, the food was flavorful and plentiful. My $7 nacho easily could have fed 2 people.  Next time I have to have that brisket. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Q-UP. And I have to say when the family & I are in the mood for BBQ I am going to have to go out of my way hunt them down.

I have been wanting to try Anayas for a while now but my husband was skeptical. He either wants Macayo's for sit down or Filiberto's for drive thru. Anaya's is a little bit of both.    Stopped in on a Friday night around 6:30 to find it empty except 1 table with 3 diners. That was a red flag but we were greeted promptly and the restaurant was exceptionally clean, even the restrooms were spotless. We were seated quickly and immediately were given chips and salsa, and without asking they brought out basically tomato sauce for my 5 year old son. He was ecstatic, he had his own salsa and it made him feel special.  I wasn't really feeling Mexican..I know, I know, so I just ordered a cheese crisp. My husband ordered the Expresso Burrito with Asada, the child ordered off the kid's menu. All items are only $3.99 and come with either rice & beans or fries. He wanted the kid's cheese crisp. I tried to get him to order something else..so we could share, but he wasn't having it.  My husbands Aunt ordered a Pastor street taco with rice.   Food came out quickly and was plated attractively.  My cheese crisp looked run of the mill, but I have to say it was exceptional. I'm really can't place what they did to that tortilla but it was delightfully crisp..almost like it was deep fried.  Husbands burro was of good size but he said the meat was cooked to much. I tried it and I would order it next time. To me the meat was carmelized from the grill and had excellent flavor. Aunt said the Pastor was good, she would visit and order the same thing again.  I did try the son's rice & beans. The beans had a good taste but the rice was just run of the mill spanish rice.  Our first dining experience at Anaya's was a excellent one, and it's a place we keep on our list. For 3 adults and a child our bill was only $40 and that included a margarita, Dos XX's and a soda. Fresh, fast food in a friendly, clean atmosphere. I hope they survive in this economy, it's a great neighborhood restaurant.
