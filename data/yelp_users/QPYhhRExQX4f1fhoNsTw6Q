If not for it's close proximity to US Airways and Chase Field stadiums, this place would be worthless. Wings are skimpy and over-cooked to a tough, stringy texture. Owner/manager/bartender certainly has no business being in the hospitality industry. Two of two times here, he was a snippy jerk.

Perhaps with the exception of the lamb (which is really just a novelty anyway), everything is very well done - all the essentials (pulled pork, spare ribs, brisket) are cooked and served the way they should be.  Sauce is served warm and delicious, although no sauce is provided on the side.  I have not seen or tasted anything much better at BBQ competitions.   Only room for improvement is on the sides... cornbread is a little dry.  But when you want good BBQ'd meat, do you really trust someone that spent too much time baking?  Focus on what's important!  As a "tip" for getting great value, get the rib tips sandwich, served open face.  It is a very generous portion for the cost and the meat is surprising meaty and tender, considering this cut is really just a byproduct.  All sandwiches are served on a warm bun that is fresh and has perfect size and texture so to not distract from the meat and sauce.  I actually look forward to CPA seminars across the street (AZ Society of Certified Public Accountants) because of Haps.

Rating is this high because it meets my expectation for what it is.  Reasonable prices and a good atmosphere for a local drinking spot.  Barstaff (Jessica in particular, in case management is listening....) really makes it worth coming back.  She is always energetic and friendly to everyone that sits at the bar.  Wings are decent, I just wish they would come out a little quicker.  I think if I stick to beer at Jessica's bar, my rating will stay high.  Side note:  please, please, please bring the Devil's Ale back!

I understand this is a bar first and restaurant second, but come on!  A bar MUST respect the WING!  That includes serving chicken wings, not pigeon wings.  Although the quality of the wing itself was disgraceful, they could at least put some lipstick on that pig!  The celery and carrot garnish on my plate were not suitable for making chicken stock in a classic mirepoix.  The prep cook must have had a seizure while prepping garnishes.  SHAME! As for the atmosphere... what is the difference between a Scottsdale douchebag and a Glendale douchebag?  Answer: a trust fund.  This place reeks of a summer's eve.  For full disclosure, though, I was there during a UFC fight. By the way, during UFC fights, there is no cover - but they charge extra for alcohol to make up for it.

Good egg was not so good today.  I'll give them the extra star just because it was mothers day and they were busy.  But biscuits and gravy came out ice cold.  Have you ever seen/eaten ice cold gravy? Its like concrete.  Much the same with the other order: oatmeal.  Came out cold too... concrete. The oatmeal here is finely ground to begin with, so it was especially gelatinous.  More like left over cream of wheat than oatmeal.  I would not recommend the oatmeal, even if served hot.

Lipstick on a pig.  Nice atmosphere, attractive staff.  But being cute only goes so far in life and in the restaurant industry.  I gave the bartender (Marissa, I think?) a second chance after she was a snob on my first visit.  Strike two and Majerle's is out.  Getting conversation out of the barstaff is like pulling teeth unless you have a popped collar and a Jersey Shore tan.  Exactly what a bar should NOT be.

On the positive side, the young staff was very welcoming and friendly.  Unfortunately, these kids lack the ability to execute real BBQ and the lack of technique and authenticity here is shameful.  As a rule, I generally love ALL BBQ and respect anyone willing make a career out of it.  I have to break that rule for this place.  They seem to be at every big event in the east valley, so they must spend more $ on marketing/promotions than anything else.  Clearly, all of their smoke is in their mirrors, not in their meat!  In my first (and last) visit here tonight, I ordered a sampler of pork, beef, and chicken.  All 3 were served pulled and had the same, grey and not-so-fresh appearance.  All meats were pulled out of metal hotel pans, which must have been covered and sitting in simmering water all day.  As the meat was being served, water was visibly dripping off of it.  I emphasize WATER, not the meat's natural juices.  The flavor reflected the watery appearance.  Any smoke flavor (I'm guessing mesquite) had been washed away by water, which is likely the result of sweating from the hotel pan.  The same water made the meat rubbery and just overall unpalatable.  Good BBQ must have a good sauce and it must be served WARM.  Not only is the sauce served cold like ketchup, it is very low quality.  In fact, I would venture to guess it is bottled.  It is way too thick for a real BBQ fan and is suspiciously close in flavor and texture to Bill Johnson's Spicy BBQ sauce.  Consistent with the main dish, the sides also disappoint.  Sweet potato fries looked like the frozen brand I buy at Costco.  The grilled vegetables were fresh, but undercooked (cooked in a fry pan, not truly 'grilled').  The cornbread had a rubbery texture, which may have simply been the result of sitting out all day.
