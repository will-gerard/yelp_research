Terrible cust service. Wanted to buy a machine and had to jump through a few hoops, I get that. I expected that. Javier tells me he's going to call me right back. I wait for a half an hour, call in twice to my man there and am told it'll just be a second. Finally I have my man pass the phone and am told pretty much the same thing, he'll have a manager call me. Another half hour and I just called the store directly. Surprise, I get the manager. Now I remember why we switched to Home Depot paint.  Update: Waiting for a call back from the manager I wrote the above review and called Sherwin Williams a block down the road, bought the rig and we're on my way. My man went to Dunn Edwards because they opened at 8. At 9:05 (Sherwin Williams opens at 9) we have our rig and ready to go at Sherwin.

I've been eating here for over twenty years. Every so often I get a craving for some green chile burro.

Great place. I get the arroz on pollo. I also love the mango chicken quesadilla. I tried pasole a week ago that was pretty good. good staff, it's usually pretty crowded but I don't mind. Just need to get there earlier in the day or later to avoid the wait.

This place is amazing. It's a little hidden. The owners are nice and friendly. I believe I've eaten everything on the menu. All the BBQ is great. Babyback Ribs when they have them are great. I really like the rice. It's unique, a little spice, with bits of green olive. Fried Shrimp is really good too.

I really enjoy this place and have been maybe a dozen times since they've opened. I like the panang and add onions, carrots and potatoes to it. My mouth is watering as I type this. It's good and quick. I'll have to swing by tonight, I've done stirred the cravings up.

I love the ambiance here. It's vintage, casual, and full of nostalgia. I've been a few times now and have loved everything I've tried. I shared a vintage soda with the kids. That was great fun and a tradition we'll continue. I really like their smokehouse turkey sandwich and Smoked BBQ Chicken sandwich. Also their soups are amazing. I tried the Cheddar Ale and Smoked Tri-Tip Chili. Both incredible.
