DO NOT GO HERE! I just bought a Groupon for a VIP wash. The manager said it would take 30-45minutes to get my car through, 1.5 hours later and my car hadn't even been started on. I had to leave without them finishing my car. Next, I get in my car and the light fabric was soiled with grease stain from the tires! So now I have to figure out how to get these grease stains out of the inside of my car.   *they did offer me a free wash to come back and have my car finished but is it really worth it? I don't think so.  UPDATE: I did end up going back for them to clean the inside of my car. The manager was very responsive to my concerns and my car ended up looking great and they finished in a timely fashion. Should have done this the first time around and I'd be a regular customer.

Great Customer Service, Great Coffee.   I forgot my wallet one trip there during their "happy hour" ($3 any size coffee)... Had no cash, change, id, punch card and the cashier insisted on buying my coffee for me. I had already loved dutch bros before but their commitment to making my morning a little better was beyond what I could of asked for. (yes, i did return with my wallet to pay for my coffee :) )
