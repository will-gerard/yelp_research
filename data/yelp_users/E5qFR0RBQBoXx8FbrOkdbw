Not a bad place at all.  I always expect a cafeteria/lunch place to be kind of blah.  They have daily specials, but you can also have them make a sandwich to your exact liking.    The price is right, the location is great for where I work (a 5 minute walk), and the view is very nice.    It's nothing fancy, but the food is good (and it can be good for you if you get the right stuff), and the staff is really nice.

Always clean and accommodating to any workout schedule.  I work near by so it is very convenient to go at lunch.  Great amenities, even a pool, and classes.  Wish there were a few more yoga classes or classes geared to those of us that are out of shape/beginners, but I'll get there.

I've been in Physical Therapy on and off for Plantar Fascitis for 8 months.  After my last visit (my 4th to this location), I quit.  I was in so much pain from the ultrasound therapy, which I started intensifying by itself to the point I ripped the boot right off my foot from the pain because they just kept coming and turning it down and it would spike again, that I swore I would not go back.    They told me the machine needed to be calibrated (really? If you know that, FIX IT).  I have never felt so uncared for at a facility designed to make a person (eventually) feel better.    I'm still having residual problems from the intensity of the ultrasound.  My foot and leg will go numb randomly.

Other than the ambiance of being a  Rock & Roll restauarnt, this place isn't good.  The food sucks.  I came in for a birthday party with 6 people, and not one of us actually enjoyed our food.  We had called ahead (2 weeks) to reserve a table before a game.  When we got there, the table had not even been set up.  We were 20 minutes later than planned getting to our table, and we missed 1 entire 1st inning and the top of the 2nd because it took so long to get our food.

After one bit of my grilled chicken sandwich, I instantly regretted going here. The lettuce was slimy, the mayo tasted rancid and the chicken was not hot. I threw out he sandwich. It was disgusting.

Dr. Argueso is nice but he's in and out quickly. His PA was terrific. She did the bulk of the appointments, she brought my son (twin B) back for his circumcision and back out to me upon its completion. Everything about the procedure was explained ahead of time: medications were dosed by weight and instructions given for aftercare when I was in a clear-headed state, not after fretting for 10-15 minutes over the procedure. I really appreciated that.  Dr. Argueso did a beautiful job on the procedure and my son actually fell asleep during it. They made sure it was a completely pain free experience for him.  He wasn't thrilled with the after care the next day, but it got easier.  Twin A needs more extensive urological surgery, sadly, and that has been planned out for a future date. I'm not looking forward to it, but I feel my son is in great hands.

Dr. Argueso and his PA Marilyn are fantastic.  Dr. Argueso is a little curt and fast, but I'm perfectly fine with that. He is a terrific surgeon and handled my son's corrective surgery perfectly. You can't even tell he had surgery.  Marilyn is so kind, so patient and she really makes sure you understand everything involved with surgery, recovery and wound care.  Thank you!

I was really impressed.  I had not been in years but it was on the way home.  I got one of those last minute "can you get a pizza" texts before I left work.  This was right on my way and the pick up window made it super convenient (although having never been to the pick up window, a sign would have been nice so I didn't look like a dork going into the restaurant).  The pizza was great, and my little picky eater who never likes anything other than cheese pizza said she wants the meatball and olive pizza again.  High praise.

What a fun little bakery.  My husband has been in love with the Coco Bars since childhood (I personally am not a fan, but that is ok).  Any time I need to score brownie points with him, I stop in on my way home from work and grab a few.    The cake bites they have are wonderful.  We got a variety of them for our Easter Egg dyeing night with family and everyone loved them.    The cupcakes are always good.

After shopping at almost every other shoe store in the area, Payless was the only one that had shoes in my daughter's size that 1) fit well 2) she liked and 3) didn't cost me $60 a pair.    They are holding up better than her Stride Rite shoes, too.

Great friend to the rescues.  We had such a great experience with them when we took our first Foster dog there for rechecks (he was very hurt and they spent 2 weeks nursing him back to health for the Arizona Boston Terrier Rescue) that when we ended up adopting the same dog, we kept using them.    We are there regularly getting each new Foster checked out, and they take the time and care with each and every dog, just like they do with our beloved Baxter.  They love what they do and the creatures they serve.

Great location, sucky parking.  Being so close to the mall you have to drive around and find something.   The food was what I have come to expect.

Even on holiday break with all the Moms and Dads there with their little ones, there was plenty of parking, short lines for the concession and carousel, and room to play on the equipment.  Lines for the train were VERY long, so we were unable to partake that day.

Super disappointed in the kids shoe selection.  There were very few pairs of athletic shoes in my daughter's size (size 2 kids), and the ones they had did not fit her well at all. They were either too wide, or they would slip off.    We had one employee greet us when we came in, but we were ignored by every other person there.  We left without making a purchase.

What a great place.  Cash only folks, so be warned!  They do have an ATM at the front but you will have to pay the fee.  The food is terrific, and ranges from sandwiches to meatloaf dinners to Mexican food.  They also do a killer breakfast.  They have daily specials and they make pies fresh daily.

I am not a big fan of this store when compared to the next closest location on Indian School & Hayden.  While this location is the closest to my house, I tend to avoid going here. The layout is odd. It is trying to be an AJ's, I feel (Bashas' owns AJ's and Food City, as well). But it is unnecessary since there is an AJ's 2 miles away.  The layout of the store is weird to me. I feel the interior aisles have no real rhyme or reason, and they do not flow logically.  The store was remodeled a few years ago and I had hope that it would feel more like other newly remodeled locations. It is dark. The middle door dumps you right in to the thick of the registers and self-checkout islands. The floral department is stuck in a far corner by the seafood, which is across from the lunch meat.    And of all the locations, I feel this staff (at least the night staff) is the least friendly. I never get eye contact or even a "hi" without saying to them first.  I think this store, the staff, and the management needs to try a heck of a lot harder.  P.S. My father is a former employee of the company, lives in the neighborhood, and HE won't go to this store.

I have never had a bad experience at this location, and I've been coming here since it opened (not sure what the other reviews are talking about). We have a few favorite servers we ask for by name.    If we try something that isn't great, we let them know. But that is rare.  And usually if we try something new they are promoting, the servers will tell you if it is a good item or not so good (so if you aren't sure, ask them).   The servers are always attentive and fun. They take care of us and really do great with our 5 yr old.

Worst breakfast I have ever had!!! 40 minute wait to take our order. Then the bacon was undercooked, my scrambled eggs were fried eggs they chopped up, and the Belgian waffle was a thin little waffle I could have made better at home. The syrup was super sticky sweet, too. I could not eat most of my meal.  I was home not 5 minutes before I got violently sick. I'm calling the health department on the morning.

Majorly disappointed. Service was awful, they refused to check the back when we couldn't find what we needed. And the store had only been open less than 30 minutes and there were almost no customers.    They had about 7 or 8 pairs of tennis shoes for my daughter, not one pair in her size (and not all of them were on sale).      The selection was ok for the clothes, but the prices were extraordinary.  We left without making a purchase and headed to Target.

Love the bean dip with the chips and salsa. No one does that and I think it is devine.  The margaritas are great, if you get them on the rocks. I wasn't a fan of the frozen banana margarita.  It did not have a lot of flavor.  The food is always good, always extremely hot, and always full of flavor.    I recommend you don't sit in the bar area.  It is noisy and you can hear every conversation going on in the kitchen (it would help if the staff were a tad more professional when they are in ear shot...I learned a few things about a few people there I didn't want to know).

Can't praise this location enough.   We purposely come at off times because we have twins in a stroller, and who wants to have a meal with two potential monsters (who have never acted up in public btw, but I have that fear).  They always seat us towards the front at a big table that has space next to it for the huge stroller where no one will be bothered by it or us.  The staff is ALWAYS friendly. They love to come by and peak at the boys or talk to them.  They accommodate my daughter's requests without giving attitude (some places that are family restaurants won't even acknowledge she is speaking to them and will only deal with parents).    The food is great, and when it isn't they make it great.  They really want to make the experience a good one.  **Tip to the mom's with kids out there, don't get the fajitas. One handed fajita eating is a pain in the backside, and the one time I ordered them with kids in tow was the one time one of them chose to need a bottle at the exact time the fajitas came out of the kitchen.

Yum.  Haven't been here in, like, 20 years, but I can promise it won't take that long to go back. The dogs were perfect. I'm not a huge hot dog fan, but when I want one, I want one grilled and slightly charred. That's what I got.  The fries and onion strings were SO good. Hot and crispy and full of flavor. Not a lot of fancy anything, just your classic hot dog toppings, simple fries and onion rings (when you do it right you don't need to cover it up).  They also have burgers and shakes. Must try next time.

Yummy as always.  I had the Turkey Chive Crepe Eggs.  It was great.  I wish they still had the California Delight on the menu.  That was my favorite.  This is the location nearest my work and I was surprised to get 1) a parking spot and 2) a table with no wait.  It is right across from St. Joe's and it is always packed.  But apparently 12:40 is the time to go.  Darn, I gave away the secret.

I had a great experience yesterday. I used the online check in system from my desk and headed straight over. It said I would have a 17 minute wait when I checked in, and once I got there I sat maybe 5 minutes.    My stylist was asked a lot of questions and he did a great job on my hair (hadn't been cut in almost a year...such is the life of a twin mom), and did a great blow out (took time, but it was so worth it) after with product so I could get back to work. I was gone from work a grand total of 61 minutes with travel.  Everyone commented on how great it looked when I got back (first time it wasn't pulled back in a clip for 4 months).  Will definitely go again.

This was another lunchtime find a co-worker suggested. The parking is iffy, but the food more than makes up for it. Service was fast, everyone was polite and the food was terrific. I had the chicken parmesan sandwich and I would go back.  Others in our office pick up pizza on their way home and swear by the place, though I have not had the pizza yet to confirm.

Great sandwiches. But if you do not order ahead, plan on a wait and a hard time parking.  With the hospital across the street, it is a very popular place.  If you can order ahead or go at an off time, you will be so happy.  I very rarely switch up my order, but everything I've had I like.  I usually get the Encore (hot roast beef with peppers and feta sauce).  It is a little bit of heaven on a roll.

The only reason I went is because my Dad wanted a taco.  The last few times I have eaten here it has been nothing but a greasy mess.    I miss the days when Julio G's was down the street.  The quality control and level of care to the food has gone WAY down hill in the last few years, and it is really sad to see.    With it being right next to the W, you'd think they would strive to be the best place ever.  If I was staying there, I'd walk to downtown and find something else.

Let me start by saying that to get 1 star from me is hard.  I will give anyone a chance (or 2, off nights happen to the best of us), but I have never been so disappointed  in Mexican food as I was last night.  And this was not the first time I've been to Los Olivos.  We were regulars for a very long time (even organizing office Christmas parties there), but the quality of the food, the taste of the food, the service and the employees dedication has taken a severe nose dive over the last few years.  But having not been in about 2 years I stupidly thought I would give it another chance with the hopes that changes in staff and time would have made the experience better.  For a restaurant THAT close to a spring training facility, they should be striving to be the best and attract the clientele that will come back year after year. Word of mouth is key in Scottsdale to keeping a business going.  You can have a flashy restaurant, fancy chef, but if the food and service sucks, no one will go.  I have been here MANY times over the years and last night was THE most dreadful.  To start with the guy taking names at the front was totally disinterested in being there.  I spelled my name for him and he still spelled it wrong.  When I corrected him he ignored me.  I spelled it again and he gave me a blank stare and said kind of half-assed "sorry", but didn't change it and continued his riveting conversation with the bus boy that he must have felt I  interrupted.   We were seated in the back room by the patio and ignored for 10 minutes (no menus, no drinks).  Our waitress was obviously slammed because we saw her running back and forth the whole time covering the inside and the patio and another dining room.  The noise level was the loudest it has ever been.  The salsa was all tomato water and no substance.  The "fresh lime margarita" had almost no tequila and the strongest taste of bottled lime juice ever.  The food was awful.  We ordered a cheese crisp and my daughter took one bite and said it was gross.  I tried it and she was right.  The oil coming off the cheese was immense and the tortilla was burnt.  I brushed off the bad cheese crisp, thinking (hoping) it was just an off night, but when I got my Steak Picado, the beans and rice were the worst I've ever had.  The rice was dry, tasteless and clumped together.  The beans were crusty and had no flavor.  But they did have a huge puddle of oil forming on the top.  The steak was fine, but after having tried the rice and beans my stomach hurt and I couldn't eat.    My husband ordered the Mexican pizza and he had the same puddle of oil on his.  He asked for no tomatoes and it was covered in tomatoes.  The meat was fine, but again the tortilla was burnt.  The friend we brought with us barely touched her burrito.  We were all unsatisfied.  I was even more upset when I got a $60+ bill after telling the waitress we were unhappy.  I will never go back.  I was willing to give them another chance last night, but there are way better restaurants to choose from and spend less money at for really good food.

I've been coming here for years. It is the neighborhood spot, and the food is terrific. I love just about everything they make.  The Enchantment Platter is a go to staple for me. It offers a little bit of everything. And when the chili's are in season they add the most amazing heat to an incredibly flavorful dish. This is not for out-of-towners with little experience with real chili's.  I love the atmosphere and the staff.  I have no qualms about bringing my kids when it isn't busy.

If you are looking for furniture, or even some unusual items for your home or a gift, this is a fun place to search.    My husband and I went in after checking out My Sister's Attic across the parking lot (and finding nothing), and enjoyed a good hour of searching all the different vendor displays.  We found a few things we really enjoyed and some stuff we wouldn't put in our house if you paid us, but that's the joy of a place like this.  Everyone's personal style is represented and you can find treasures or trash, depending on your view.

They always have what I am looking for.  My only complaint is that the store is soooo busy any time I go.  I guess that is a good thing though.    Staff is always friendly and helpful.  They even have tiny shopping carts for their tiny shoppers to push and help with the shopping.  My kiddo LOVES to help and loves to push her own cart.  The flowers are top notch, last for days, and I cannot leave without a bunch...or 2 or 3.  Produce is fresh and the variety is great.  I love the specialty items they get.

This was an amazing night. It was a romantic birthday dinner for 2 (entirely planned by my hubby).  The staff greeted me with a signed birthday card, they listened to my husband's request for a table with a heater on one side and not on the other (he gets way too hot too fast).    The service was top notch and the food was a bit of heaven.  If you go, try the Parmesan Fries with the Truffle Aioli with your dinner. Any other french fry will suck in comparison.  I can't wait to go back. They do brunch!

Waited an hour and a half for my first appointment. No one called me back, no one said anything. I finally ask and they say it will be another hour. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I had a babysitter with my newborns. I can't be away from them for 2 and a half hours!  Not only that, they used previous patients as the excuse.

This place is great. Sadly I am on my third trip here in as many months (kids lose glasses ALL THE TIME), but they have the prescription on file, as well as the frame my kiddo likes.    Buying here is cost effective. The first pair we bought our daughter at the ophthalmologist's office cost over $200 (and that is with insurance and glasses allowance). Each pair I've bought here is around $50 (and that is only because I get the scratch coating and have to rush the shipping).  Great staff, good selection. Highly recommend.

Terrific.  We were in and out in under 20 minutes.  Had to have them hook up the car to see what a light was trying to indicate.  Our mechanic couldn't see us and since it was ABS related we headed in.  We were able to diagnose it as a cable issue and not actually a brake issue.  My hubby got the car up on a rack and lo and behold, the cable came lose.  Plugged it back in and we have not had an issue since.  This saved us a ton of money and time.

I have loved Defalco's for years. They have a terrific Chicken Parm sandwich. And the canolli's are delicious.  I've tried several sandwiches at lunch and nothing disappoints.  They use Boar's Head meats and you can taste the difference.  If you are coming to eat in, don't come around lunch time. It fills up fast. It has a tiny eating area (surrounded by the groceries: Italian canned foods, wines, specialty items), and a patio.    Order ahead and come with patience.  But it is worth it!

I was introduced to this place by my husband one day for lunch. WOW, what a find. The sandwiches are great, the owner and his wife are incredibly welcoming, and the people in the dining area all seemed to be regulars and happy to be there.   The sandwich I ordered, a #29 hot roast beef with mushrooms and provolone, was lovely.  I really enjoyed it. Simple and delicious.  If I'm in the area again, I will be sure to stop in.

I'm a regular.  My 5 year asks to go here all the time.  This is the extended family meeting spot, as well.  It is a great "go to" spot for Mexican food.  The service is always friendly, the food is always good, and the atmosphere is great.

They have have renovated the restaurant and updated the menu, and I don't know that is for the better. We were told we could get almost everything off the old menu, which is what I did (Baja chimi), hubs had the new grilled fish tacos and the kid had mac n cheese.  To start, the salsa was VERY runny when compared to the old. Cutting my chimi was very difficult. For the restaurant that claims it invented the chimi, I find this disappointing. The flavor of the chicken was the same, but the tortilla tasted old and like they left it in the fryer too long. And the Baja sauce is $2 extra. No thanks, I'll get frozen chimi's and deal. It will be a LONG time before I ever want another one,  though.  Hubs liked his tacos but the portion size is too small. Barely any fish, tons of cabbage. And his side of beans was a child's portion.  And the part that makes me upset. My kid always orders mac n cheese and I know it is Easy Mac. Well they made it pretty poorly. She wouldn't eat it. How do you screw up microwaved mac n cheese? I mean, really?  The staff was nice, but that was my only good thing to say.  Lunch on a Sunday and there was almost no one there. That speaks volumes. I should have listened to my gut. Now my gut is screaming at me from how unhappy it is. Lesson learned and I won't go back.

I went here with a group of friends for lunch. What a treat!  The food was wonderful.  I had the Ai Spinaci, a sauted spinach, prosciutto & fontina sandwich.  A little slice of heaven.  My friends each had sandwiches (of which I can't remember) but they all liked them.  The parking is a little rough, as there are only 6-8 spots in the lot behind the restaurant (a converted house in mid-town), but there is street parking nearby.  I suggest going early, as it is popular.  And I can see why.  The staff was very nice, and we were seated right away on the patio.  Our glasses were always filled.  I will be back!!!

I had a lovely time with my daughter and my brother-in-law. My little one was REALLY excited that the My Little Pony dolls were in stock (she chose Rainbow Dash), and she took her time picking out clothes, washing her new friend, and making the birth certificate.   She even convinced her Uncle he needed to make a bear for his wife.  It was quite adorable.

I really love this place. We came for Christmas dinner with our family (2nd time doing that, by the way).  The service was impeccable, the food was scrumptious, and the atmosphere was very welcoming and serene.    The holiday menu was fabulous, but being pregnant there are only so many things I can/want to eat right now.  But for the holiday they had the regular menu available along with the holiday menu.  Our server was great, but very busy.  She had a lot of tables but she was easy to track down if we needed something.  I can't wait to come back for brunch.

Love me some Ikea! I still can't find a time when it isn't crowded, but I can deal. I always come with a purpose, whether it be a specific project or coming on a fact finding mission after the new catalog comes out to get ideas.  The prices are competitive and the furniture, even the cheap stuff, really holds up.

I adore each location I have been to.  I truly wish this location had not moved from its place on Hayden Road (as it was so close to my home), but I do hope the foot traffic is better for their sake.  The selection is amazing. I can spend hours smelling each mix and pondering what I want to cook next.  I have successfully replaced every spice and herb in my cabinet with a Penzy's version, and I am so happy that I did.    You will not be disapointed.

I don't care which one I go to, and for what I'm going for, I drop $100 each and every time.    What is it about the Target that sucks you in and makes you decide you need a Soda Stream today, or a whole new set of bath towels?  I don't care. I love Target. I always will.

I really liked our experience.  Our salesman, Brad, never once pressured us.  We told him what we were looking for, he pointed out where they were and waited until we had questions. Every other furniture store we had gone to that day the sales staff hovered, pushed, pressured and wouldn't leave us alone.    And when we didn't like the product, they would try to get us to sit on it again and try it again.  I'm sorry, but I know if it isn't what I'm looking for. I don't need someone who doesn't know how we live or what we like telling me something that sucks is great.  The store had Despicable Me playing on multiple televisions and my daughter was just in heaven. She could help us pick a sectional and still watch her movie.  Or she would stay at a display while we discussed an item and she was only a few feet away where we could watch her the whole time.  Genius, Mor!!! Absolutely genius.  We left happy, and unlike other experiences I have yet to feel an ounce of buyers remorse.    The delivery for the sectional went quickly, smoothly, and at the time they said.  And the product is exactly what we saw in the store.  It looks great and I really feel like it will last us for years.

What a gem! I've worked down the street from this place for 4 years and I just tried this place at the request of a co-worker. Simple burgers and hot dogs (the chili dog was wonderful), fries, onion rings and shakes.   They also have breakfast but I have not tried that yet.  I really enjoyed the food, the staff and the ease of parking in downtown Phoenix.

Try harder, please.  This used to be a great location. The food was always put together with care, it was hot, the chicken juicy.  Now, we get attitude from the staff, nasty attitude from the younger staff, the chicken tastes rubbery, the fries were almost raw, and they left us sitting in the parking lot waiting for them to bring out our drive-thru order. I finally had to go in and they had totally forgotten about us.  They tried to give us our cold food and I made them make it fresh.  I was SO not please.

I love PB, this one in particular. I worked there in High School (eons ago).  I really feel like this location tries harder than the free standing stores since there is so much competition in the food court.  The cookies are better, the sandwiches just taste like more care was put into their making, and the staff is friendly and efficient.  The salads are more carefully crafted and are not drowning in dressing.  I don't know if it is the training or what, but I feel like the effort the staff puts out shows their commitment to good food, and their pride in their work.

I really love this restaurant and I have for years. I've recently rediscovered this little gem.  I worked in the neighborhood years ago and I would frequent Noodles Ranch for the Pho. OMG, seriously good Pho.  I recently was able to talk my extremely picky husband to try it.  I got him to try the spring roll.  And he tried a dish with lemongrass and chicken that he was really happy.  Score!   I had the Pho with tofu.  I was very happy (especially because I wasn't feeling all that great and the Pho was so soothing and delicious).  They provided me with copious amounts of lime and mint upon request and I was one happy girl.  I will admit, I've only ever had the spring rolls and Pho, but I've never been disappointed.    The ambiance is surprising, it is in a strip mall.  But you walk in to a really airy and comfortable space.  The decor is unique and fresh.    The staff, other than the owner that ended up helping us, is a little lacking the service skills, but hopefully that will develop with time.  I hope they crack the whip on the sitting on the counters by the register, talking on their cell phones, and the lack of attention (hence the reason the owner took over, I assume).

My husband and I love bringing our 7 year old here. She gets the biggest kick out of the games and spending time having fun.  And we love that the food is of a really high quality and e know she is going to eat something better than icky pizza or tired chicken nuggets.   Plus we like sitting and having a nice meal before we go running after her for an hour or so.

I love this place. It is so much better than Red Lobster.   Menus are printed twice per day so the information is up-to-date and you never have anything run out.  The seafood is as fresh as it can be, seeing that we are nowhere near the ocean, and the variety of options is tremendous.  It isn't just your classic steamed with lemon or fried with tartar sauce.    Every experience here has been top notch. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for seafood.

I really enjoy this.  Every week or two I participate in the co-op, buy a basket and on occasion some of the additional offerings.    The volunteers that run our location (Scottsdale at Pueblo Elementary school) are always so on top of it.  You may have to wait in line to get your order, but it really isn't a long wait and everyone is usually in a good mood, which is always helpful.    I haven't had an experience where I've had to refuse any produce.  It has always come in perfect shape.  I really do enjoy doing this, and I know we eat better as a family when we have the fresh, high quality produce we get from Bountiful Baskets.

Thank you for being wonderful!  The beer is terrific, the Southwest Chicken sandwich is the only thing I ever order because it was the first thing I ordered years ago and I don't need to try anything else.  And those garlic fries are to die for.  This is one of my favorite places for a Girls Night or a fun place to take the extended family.

I've only been once but wow. I was impressed. This place came highly recommend by my husband's New York born and bred boss.  This is the only place he will get pizza. I can see why.    My husband tried the pizza (cheese pizza's are on special this summer, just sayin').  He got his loaded with pepperoni, sausage, pineapple and ricotta. He downed a personal sized pizza in record time. I've never seen him so happy.  I decided to try the chicken parmesan meal. It was terrific. The chicken was crispy, juicy and flavorful. Not greasy as some tend to be.  The red sauce, which I hope is what they use on the pizza because it was perfect, was just the way I like it. Not a hint of sugar. There is nothing worse than sweet tomato sauce in my book.  I would happily go again and I would recommend highly.

I'd like to say a big Thank You to the staff at this location. They put on hold for me a gold deer head for my sister (it was her birthday wish).  I was able to pick it up the next day. They even unpacked the box just to make sure it was in perfect condition, and they made a makeshift tape handle so it was easier to carry the awkward box to the car.  She loved it and mounted it on the wall the same day.

I was shocked at how big this location is (when compared to the tiny spot they have in Downtown Phoenix).  It was almost full and the servers were run ragged due to being short staffed, poor dears, but they fit us in.    We had to wait, but they warned us that would be the case, and we were happy to talk and be on a date (with kids, it is rare).  The server was excellent, the bartender picked up the slack by coming from behind the bar to get drink orders, and once the order was in, the meal came out fast, hot and perfect.  I will happily go back.

ALWAYS love the food.  This location is a little more difficult to maneuver (tons of college kids), but that is ok if you aren't starving and can wait a bit.  Took my 5 year old at her request and we had such a lovely time.  The staff are great and treat everyone well.  Even a slightly hyper kiddo who wants to chat with everyone.  People watching is great, the food is always just what you want, and the drinks are top notch.

UPDATE: We are regulars now. There is not one thing on that we have tried that has been a dud. The House Wonton Soup is killer.  A little of this, a little of that, and big flavorful wontons. You get enough to share and my boys gobble this up. I'm also a big fan of the Gyoza.   My daughter loves the noodle dishes and my husband is a big Pork Fried Rice fan.   If you remember, order the donuts. They are lovely and not overly sweet.

I was surprised at how good a restaurant attached to the Bass Pro Shop could be.  Boy was I wrong to pre-judge.    We went there at the birthday request of my daughter (she turned 6 and wanted to be there with the fish tank to look at). The staff was wonderful and put together a table with a terrific view of the fish tank because she asked them so nicely.    We tried the alligator appetizer.  I didn't like it but every one at the table enjoyed it.  I had a really wonderful Catfish Etoufee. Yummy.

What a fun place!!  The ice cream and sorbet flavors are so unique.  Last night I had a scoop of the Basil Lime sorbet and a scoop of the Lavender ice cream (I am a sucker for lavender).  My daughter and husband both had the Pumpkin Spice ice cream and loved it.  This is a fun place for a little treat and some fun family time. They even have board games that the customers can use.  And when you leave, be sure to check out the freezer full of pre-packed pints.  I saw some yummy flavors in there that must be part of the rotation but that were not in the case.    Can't wait to go back.

Went in for the first time time today.  I was greeted as soon as I entered, by both human and canine staff (love that).  I was shown right where the food I had been searching all over town for was located, and chatted a bit. It was lovely experience and I will most assuredly be returning. My pups love the Honest Kitchen Preference, and it is hard to find in town. I am so happy I stumbled on this little gem of a store!

I was very frustrated with this group.  After having a referral from my Perinatologist faxed multiple times by them and by me, having multiple calls unreturned, I FINALLY got a hold of someone 3 weeks later.  Then I was told to just come in without an appointment. Which I did.  Then when I got there they made a huge deal about me not having an appointment.  The whole experience took an hour for a 10 second EKG test (I kid you not, it took 10 whole seconds).  And that was after I finally was called back and the technician couldn't even find the information she needed that was written on the referral from (a form that originated from AZ Cardiology Group, I might add).  I had to show her where the Drs name was, the phone number, the code for the test.  And all of it was written clearly and it was easy to read.  Seriously?  Should the patient have to do the job of the front office staff AND the tech running the equipment??

The pizza was soggy, cold and when I think of a chicken caesar pizza, I think of flat bread with a fresh salad and grilled chicken, not blah bottled dressing under greasy, cold cheese and nary a lettuce leaf in sight.  It took too long on top of it.

I've been to this location 3 times now (2 times for events, once for a free paint session with my daughter).  I always get immediate assistance with a project, the staff is more than willing to help out, and it is a fun way to spend a little time.    I always take my daughter with me, she's 5, and every time we go she asks when we can come back.   The most recent event was the Dog Paw Print ornaments.  We made our reservation and had no more than a few moments wait while they took care of the pup in front of us.  They were in and done quickly and we will pick up the result this week (which they paint in order to speed up the process and freak the dogs out the least).    I've done 2 Mother's Day events (one here, one at Desert Ridge), and by far the best location was Rio Salado.  It was much more organized and the staff really had their stuff together.  I think this years' project was the best and with the step by step instructions, it turned out so well.  And I was hesitant to do another project after the 2011 fiasco at the Desert Ridge location.

Very nice facility.  We came here for a Live reading of the book "Tales from the Firehouse" and I was not disappointed.   The rooms they used were a bit small for the turn out, but it was the first reading.  There were several events taking place and everyone seemed to have the space needed, and parking was sufficient.

As an Arizona Native, I feel that anyone that lives in the state needs to visit the halls of state government at least once.  The Arizona State Capitol museum is free and the tours give you an amazing insight into how things used to be and why things are what they are (go and see).  I was lucky enough to Arizona History in school (I don't know if that is even a requirement anymore, but it should be), so I've made the trek many a time before I became a state worker.  Now my visits are more for business.  Make the trip, folks.  So much history, so many politics.

It is quite the party place at night, but 11am to about 3pm, it is a fun place to kick back, chat, watch a game, drink a beer, and eat some seriously yummy food.    I love that it is close by, parking is easy during the day, and everyone is always happy and friendly.  The staff are quick to recommend an entree or even a drink if I don't have one in mind.

Terrific! I am glad I chose this venue for our anniversary dinner.  I've been wanting to go since they opened, but things have never worked out. My husband and I just celebrated our 10 year anniversary and I wanted to take him someplace special. What do [most] men love? Meat!  I made our reservations on their website and requested a quiet corner for our anniversary.  We were seated in a quieter corner (it is a big open space, noise travels, be prepared for that) where we could talk.  We were instructed about the courses (salad bar first, meat and side next) as they sat down the most wonderful popover style rolls and fried polenta - both hard to resist. We were also warned to pace ourselves. Excellent advice. Hard to follow. There are way too many delicious options.  The salad bar isn't your typical american style salad bar with pre-cut veggies, salad dressings, etc. This had a pre-tossed salad, steamed veggies, dried/cured meats, cured fish, cheese, marinated mushrooms, pasta salad, rice, potatoes, and more that I cannot remember off the top of my head. It was wonderful!  Next came the meat. They use little cards at the table. Green means "bring the meat", red means "no meat needed". The server brought out cheddar mashed potatoes and cooked bananas for our sides (I didn't care for the bananas, but my husband loved them).   Then come the gauchos with long swords of meat: all kinds of beef, pork, chicken, and lamb. Different cuts, different seasonings, different cooked temperatures. And they come sometimes 2 at a time to the table. It can be overwhelming, but don't be afraid to say no or flip the card over and sample what you have already.  We tried a little slice of just about everything, but over the course of about an hour. We'd get a few slices, flip the card over so they would go to the next table, enjoy, repeat.  Our server, Robert (who was fantastic) brought out a little chocolate lava cake and ice cream with the words "Happy Anniversary" spelled out on the plate in strawberry sauce. It was wonderful. But by that time I was so full that I had one bite and taped out.   It was a great experience.  That being said, I dressed up and it seemed like no one else did.  It was a little disheartening to be seated next to a group of guys who looked like they just left the gym - and yes, I get they really can't control the attire of their clientele without going formal..    And for the cost (not cheap, $50 for dinner), I would have preferred a place where people didn't bring little kids.  This is not a family restaurant. I know I wouldn't bring my kids. Men are carrying around giant blades of meat for crying out loud. Their were several babies crying and it was very distracting. I was there to get away from my own babies for an hour or so.

This place is amazing! The bagels are top notch, made fresh daily in-house, and the service is excellent.  The variety of bagels choices, cream cheeses and coffee drinks is great. Get a sandwich, a breakfast option, a wrap, a salad, soup, and a dozen to go.  The atmosphere is casual but condusive to having a business meeting.    Have a few minutes and want to relax?  Take a load off on the couch and read the paper while you enjoy your breakfast.

I really enjoyed this place.  Parking is rough, especially on a school night, but after 5 the meters are free.  Worth the block or 2 walk.  Came for a happy hour with friends.  We had the chicken quesadillas, which were pretty darn good for it being an Irish bar.  Food and drink (Harp, yum) were 1/2 price for Happy Hour.    Good atmosphere, not overly loud so I was able to chat with my friends,

I really like this store. It is clean, the staff if friendly and polite. And they carry multiple brands and types of soy milk, baby food, and they have great specials at the meat counter almost every week.  The produce always looks good and lasts for several days.    The bakery is nice, though the housemade donuts are not the best.  We have purchased 2 cakes for birthday parties and received compliments.  I do wish the deli counter carried Boar's Head. The brand they have there tastes incredibly salty. I go to Basha's or Sprouts to get lunchmeat.  I wish there were more non-dairy options available. They used to carry almond and coconut milk yogurt, but that seems to have gone away. I have 3 lactose intolerant kids, so one stop shopping would be VERY nice.

Always a line wrapped around the building, but the line moves fast and the coffee is always hot, delicious and perfectly done.  Never too sweet, never burnt.  The staff is ALWAYS happy and they greet you promptly and you cannot help but smile.    I personally think Dutch Bros. coffee is the best coffee around.

I was really disappointed with the waitress.  I seriously did not need to know it was her first day back from having the flu, and I really did not enjoy being soaked when the server dropped a tray of waters on our table and all over me.   No one apologized, and no manager came when I asked for one.

I love this place. It doesn't matter what off the wall idea I have, they have what I need.  I needed mugs on Christmas Eve for a brunch the next day (because I realized last minute that I had 4 and a bunch of people were coming the next morning).  I actually found 6 matching mugs that I loved (wished I could have found more, but I was super glad I got what I got).  I always find the best clothes for my daughter, as well.

Wow, what a neat place.  I was taken here for lunch for Admin Professionals Day (a day early) and it was so nice.  I love the indoor/outdoor seating (big garage doors open up to create this open and airy walk thru space).  I had the Modern Tiki Fish Sandwich.  Everything was excellent.  The cole slaw, which I am not normally a fan of, added a wonderful tangy crunch to the sandwich.  The ice tea was always being refilled, the staff was very friendly and quick to offer suggestions when those in our party were stuck deciding on 2 different items.    A real winner.  I will be back.

It has been years, if not a decade, since I went to an Applebee's.  Last time the food, the service, everything was just awful..  I went out of sheer hunger and proximity, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The service was great, and fast.  The food was hot and tasty.  We ended up just having a bunch of appetizers (who doesn't love an appetizer dinner, you know), and everything was great.  The pretzel sticks were terrific and the wings were done just the way I like.  Not over done and just saucy enough.  We will be returning.

The food is always good, but it can be hard to get in and out and back to work in an hour.  It gets busy and I think they could use another server or two during the lunch rush to get the patrons in and out.   Parking is rough, so leave early (do an early lunch).  I usually still have to park a couple blocks away.  Not bad when the weather is nice, but I can see it being misery in August.

I adore this museum. Concerts, exhibits, a cafe. You can really make a day of it.  There is a lab where you can try all the instruments, and my daughter will not leave the museum until she's had a chance to play with everything.  Gift cards make a wonderful gift for the music lover in your life. You can use them at the store, for admission or for the cafe.

I am so upset. I was promised 5 free oil changes when I bought my car. I have received 1 and when I took it in for the next one I needed, as well as recall work, I was informed (AFTER the fact) that there was no record of the free oil changes. Not only that, they charged us for a tire rotation I did not authorize. The only thing that should have been charged was the new oil filter.   They also charged to repair a nail in a tire. Had I known they would I would have taken it to Discount Tire. That service is always free.  And what started my bad mood was their insistence I did not have an appointment. I have both the original email when I made the appointment and the reminder, but they said I must have made the appointment the night before. I made the appointment over 2 weeks in advance.  Not only will I never get work done at their service center (I'll drive to ANY OTHER dealership for warranty or recall work), I will not buy a vehicle or recommend anyone buy a vehicle from them.  That process was a 4 day nightmare on it's own.    It took them that long to locate a car that fit what we wanted and agreed to purchase in their inventory, then we couldn't purchase it because rats had eaten the wires and disabled the engine - SERIOUSLY!!!

Great experience last week with Dr. Kessler. She removed a mole for testing in the most painless way every.  She is very personable, friendly, and talks to her patients with kindness and knowledge. It was very refreshing to be talked to like an intelligent person by a doctor.  Took awhile to get my first appointment but now that I am established I was informed that I will be able to see the doctor in a more timely fashion at appointments to come.

Super fun night.  Before a show upstairs in the showroom, a couple of friends and I enjoyed dinner at the Blue Coyote Cafe.  What a place! The decor is very modern and it does not detract from the food or the company.  It is a little bit of a noisy place, but it adds to the excitement of the evening.  Two of us had the Chicken Caesar Salad and I must say I was very happy with the salad. Not too much dressing, perfectly cooked chicken, fresh and crisp lettuce.  One of the best I've had.    The other one of us had steak and eggs.  She was very happy with her meal, as well.  I also had a Mojito.  It was heavy on the alcohol (which I love), unlike most bars that water down the first drink to see if you will drink more.  It was terrific.  Very balanced and full of flavor.  I would most definitely got back.

What I have come to expect. Actually there are some things on this menu I get a real craving for. Their pastas are so flavorful and the integrity of the dish does not diminish when you take it 'to go'.  The salads and soups taste so fresh. And the sandwiches are so jam-packed with flavor and ingredients that one is not left feeling hungry.  Every time I go I have to pick up a fresh loaf of sourdough. It makes THE best sandwiches (make a late night grilled cheese and tell me just how yummy it is!) or side to a great bowl of pasta or soup.  Try the iced tea. Delish!

I'm currently taking my 17 month old twins through the program, having previously taken my daughter several years ago - then we used the 32nd street location. The instructor (Lauren) has a way with kids in general, and the fact that she can engage my little guys and the rest of the babies in the class, is something special.  I am a big fan of the program.  It not only teaches water safety and how to get out of the water should the little ones fall in, but how to float, and eventually the strokes.  This location is convenient, always clean and staffed with friendly, positive, and helpful staff.  I highly recommend!!

First time in and I will make it a point to go back. They make Parisian style macaroons that taste exactly like they should: crisp then chewy, then melt in your mouth amazing. I am sitting in the parking lot waiting for my husband who had to run in and get more.   We will be back. It is so worth the crowded parking lot.

Good location, lots of parking and lots of space.  Even a little play area for the kiddos.    I much prefer eating in because there is nothing better than a cheese pizza fresh out of the oven.  WOW.  Having to wait to eat it at home any pizza will lose that oven fresh perfection.  The wings are great and the pizza is pretty darn good, too.  They go a little heavy on the pizza sauce for my taste, but I will just remember to ask for light sauce next time.  The place is always busy on the weekends.  And expect to run into teams celebrating a win or licking their wounds for a loss.  But it is still a great atmosphere. And one I am hesitant to take my kid into.

My husband and I tried this place out of sheer starvation one afternoon (we never like Le Peep and were afraid of what it would be like), and we were very pleasantly surprised.  The food was delicious, with both classic dishes and new twists.  The coffee was excellent.  We've been back several times now, and we've even taken our 5 year old.  She now wants Sunday breakfast at Butter's ever week and asks for it by name.   They treat kids fantastically and the service is always great.  And during the nice weather, take advantage of the patio seating.  It is delightful!  I've now had there regular coffee and some of their coffee drinks, and I can say they are excellent.  No bitterness to the coffee and not overly sweet when a latte or mocha.

THE worst location.  The wait is terrible. I was told 10 minutes on a phone order, headed up there with our toddlers expecting a quick turn around, sent the hubs in to get the food...WAITED FOR 30 MORE MINUTES.  Thought was a one time fluke and called in an order. Same thing (only this time I stayed home with the babies. He was gone an hour and the order was wrong. The chicken was under cooked and had to be thrown away.

I went here for my husband's birthday on a recommendation from a friend.  It was an excellent decision.  We made a reservation, but we still had a bit of a wait.  It is a VERY popular place on a Friday night.  The place was packed, but the server took good care of us.  The only complaint with the meal was that our calimari was overdone and a bit greasy.  I just won't order it again.  My hubby had a wonderful chicken salad that he raved about for 2 days.  And I had Linguini with white clam sauce and the roasted brussel sprouts.  I would get those brussel sprouts again just as a dinner, they were fantastic.  The clams were perfectly cooks and the sauce was devine.  We even took home a Nutella Calzone.  Super yummy, but they included ice cream in the to go box and didn't tell us and it was melted by the time we got home.

Always a crowd, but there is a reason.  And the reason is amazing food.    The lunch special gets you in and out (after you get a table) really quickly.  It is always the highest quality, fresh ingredients, and a fast, friendly, efficient staff that does the best job, despite the throng of people every day.   I've been there 3 times in the last 6 weeks and I've tried the mushroom, the chicken parmesan, and the shrimp pizzas.  All were good.  I look forward to working my way through the menu.  I haven't ventured past the Cesar salad, though, as it is just so darn good.

I have been going here since shortly after they opened and I must say, I probably will not buy meat at a grocery store again.   The quality of the products they sell is exceptional. The marinated chicken breasts are huge, and so flavorful. One serves all 3 of us and you can cut them with a fork. The beef is lean, so fresh and so tender. I cannot wait to order my fresh thanksgiving turkey.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I cannot say enough good things about Penzey's.  Every spice and herb I own now is in a Penzey's bottle, and for good reason.  The quality is top notch, the expertise of the staff at each store (there are 2 in Phoenix) is second to none, and the inspiration I get after every visit to the stores is where the fun lies.    Spices last longer than store bought.  The flavor combinations get the creative juices flowing and tasty treats just magically appear on my dinner table.

They always have a pair of chop stick helpers for my little one so she can feel like a chop stick pro.    I highly recommend taking your kids here.  My girl tends to eat more veggies or try new things when she can see it before it is cooked, and see other people trying it too.

There are not enough starts to tell you how I truly feel about this amazing restaurant.  I am not a Vegetarian, and I LOVE this place.  The food is amazing.  The quality of the ingredients is second to none and the flavors are addicting.  I started a new job down the street from the 7th street location 4 weeks ago, and I think I've been at least twice a week since.  I'd be there every day if I could afford to eat out every day :-)  I've never had a bad meal, bad service or a bad experience.  I have been going to the Tempe location since shortly after they opened.  There is no difference in the food from one location to the next.  The only down side is the parking situation at the Phoenix location.  But for this food, I'll drive around the block til a spot opens up, THAT is how good it really is.

My husband and I had a blast here.  I had 2 Black & Blue's (Guiness & Blue Moon).  Fabulous.  Honestly I don't remember what I ate after 2 of those, but my husband swears I enjoyed it.  We were there during the Olympics, so they had every TV tuned to a different event.  My sports mad hubs was in heaven.  Our server, Courtney, was friendly and on top of the drinks and checked on us often.  It was great.  We will be returning!

My Dad loved the corned beef hash, and my Mom & hubby were so pleased with the corned beef & cabbage they wish it was on the menu as a permanent item.  Kid had mac n cheese, as she is wont to do, and as always had the best time chatting with our servers about whatever was on her mind.

Thank you so much. You managed to deal with our very large group (babies and a wild child to boot) on the 22nd. We came here following a funeral and the staff were phenomenal.    The food, as always, was terrific. The pizza's were still bubbling, the appetizers were  just different enough to be intriguing, but not so different as to make everyone turn their noses up at the options.  We were all on the patio, high tops and low tables, crammed in taking up valuable real estate and I'm sure making the poor servers nuts. But the two gentlemen taking care of us (sorry guys, I didn't get your names) were so professional and personable. If we ruffled feathers they never showed it. They were on top of the refills and were just generally great!  Thank you again for accommodating us!

This is the best manicure I have ever had. The luxuries you can add on are wonderful and really allow you to customize your manicure or pedicure to your individual needs.  We came on Cinco di Mayo and received a free lime salt scrub add on, and it was wonderful. I got a gel manicure and the attention to detail was tremendous.  We were offered a drink, had the membership option explained, and shown the add on selection all before we were shown back. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming.   This place fills a niche that is so needed. It isn't a sweatshop type nail bar where they get you in and out. And it isn't a spa where they jack up the price. It is right in the middle. And it is perfect!

Love the staff and the selection. I wish there was a location a little closer to my house, but that's ok.  The staff has recommended a raw diet for my very itchy, allergic Boston Terrier.  It was an instant hit.  He had none of the typical tummy trouble associated with switching food.

For $5 and change I got a large which was probably the size of a Starbucks grande, and it was a good 3/4 of an inch short in the cup.  I was disappointed.  I've seen the sign for weeks and stopped in on my way to work.  I was the only one in line and getting the coffee took over 5 minutes, I was given no lid (and none were on the bar for that size cup).  The coffee was watered down so much milk that I couldn't taste the coffee.  I ordered a mocha and it basically tasted like weak chocolate milk.  I came to work and tried to salvage what I'd paid so much for with the coffee from the kitchen.   It didn't help much.  I won't be returning.

LOVE this place.    The prices are in line with Petsmart, but Petsmart doesn't give you your 11th bag free. Wag N Wash does.   I love the variety of both natural food and paraphenalia.  Need a leash or collar? Check here, they have a great variety.  I think I am going back to get a new collar for my sweet boy. He doesn't need one, but he'd sure look cute in some of the designs available.  Plus you can wash your dog onsite and not have to deal with clean up and smelly towels.  Or water all over your bathroom after a tub escape and subsequent shake.   Come on, dog lovers in South Scottsdale, let's make sure this wonderful place lasts!!! Shop local.

This is my favorite location. We come here every Thursday after our little ones have swim lessons. We call it in at Riverview and by the time we get to Tempe Marketplace, it is ready to go.  The staff here seem to care more about the food and your time. At Riverview I'm ALWAYS left waiting well beyond the approximate time the order is ready, and Shea is a joke.  The food is always hot, cooked well, and it travels well.

Love Dr. Kurtz and all the staff.  They always have time to get a sick kiddo in.  I don't think I've ever had to wait.   My daughter doesn't mind going there (as long as her much dreaded throat swabs are not part of the equation).  And she is always ready to tell the staff what is going on.    They make the parents feel at ease and explain everything.  They want you to ask questions and be as informed as possible.

We've gone here 3 times now and they keep getting worse.  The last time was take out and when we got home the order was totally wrong.

I would SO highly recommend these Urgent Care centers.  I have been to 2 run by PCH in my daughter's 6 years, and I've been to a couple of others.  The attention PCH gives is beyond compare.  I love that the center is totally kid focused.  They talk to the kids as well as the parents.  Other UC centers do not.    My daughter broke her arm at school last week and we took her here for an x-ray to confirm the break.  They were kind and gentle with her when she had a panic attack (fear of the unknown) and told her everything that was going to happen on a level she could understand.  By the time we left with her soft cast on, arm in a sling, she was happy as could be.   She goes back tomorrow for a hard cast and a visit with a pediatric orthopedist.   The first time I took her in (East Valley location) she was 2 and had to have a pretty invasive test.  They were kind and gentle, they gave her a book to keep and they tried to explain to her what they were doing.  If you have kids, and you have an UC need (an you WILL have a need), go to one of the PCH UC locations.

I really enjoyed the restaurant.  There hasn't been a Garcia's on this side of town in decades and this brought back many happy memories.    There was quite a wait on the Saturday we were there, but we were able to be seated in the bar at a hightop (at my 5-yr old's request).  The staff was friendly and attentive.  They really made waiting not a problem.    We were served our drink quickly, orders taken, and the food served as soon as it was ready.  No waiting under lamps.  That was nice.    It was crowded and noisy, but like I said we were in the bar. What do you expect?  The food was just like I remember it.  The quality was very good.  I think once the staff work out all the kinks of it being a brand new restaurant, brand new staff dynamic, things will run like a well-oiled machine.    I will absolutely be back.

I am upgrading this to 5 stars are it has gotten even better since it opened.  The staff is on top of everything.    The food is good, albeit not as authentic as I would like, but still good nonetheless.    Only complaint is that the sopapillas have too much cinnamon sugar.  The cinnamon sugar should be an option, as I would prefer them plain.

My hubby and I had such a wonderful experience. It was a much needed date night and I was craving a steak. Long Horn did not disappoint.  I had the Flat Iron Steak with the Stuffed Portobello mushroom, and I am so happy I did.  The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly.

Very addicting! The food is a health nuts dream, but so full of flavor that picky eaters will be happy.  The juices are terrific. They are fresh and flavorful. My 7 year old loves them and the food. She eats her veggies without complaint. She even asks to come here.

Good location, always busy, decent parking, and food is 100 time better than the Hooters that is literally across the street.  The food is always good.  Warning to the pregnant ladies: Some of the wing sauces that may not bother you before you were pregnant, will set off the morning sickness just by smell alone. Use caution!!!

Went for the first time and boy was I impressed. I came in at the tail end of the lunch hour. The staff was top notch, all the items were stocked, the iced tea was full, and my wait was barely a wait at all.  The food was hot and delicious. You can pick all the toppings and you have the benefit of seeing your choices in front of you.   I will try a made to order salad next time.

I had a great experience yesterday. Diesel did an amazing job on my hair. It was like watching an artist paint a picture.  The cut and color are amazing. I came in with a VERY rough idea and a couple of pictures. He and I chatted about what I was looking for, then I let him run with an idea we discussed. I was excited before he was even finished and that NEVER happens for me with haircuts.   This was my second cut (first color) with him, and I will most definitely be back!

Take a dose of patience, even if you make an appointment. I took my sister and my 7 year old daughter. My sister and I got right in, but they made my daughter wait until we were finished before they started on her. And like I said, we had appointments.  The location on Indian School is no better, and they spilled gel all over my shoes, did a horrible job cleaning it up, and still charged me full price.

Gross.  Flies all over the dining room. Ripped up upholstery. Big divots in the floor where  structural elements were removed and never patched.  Now the food.  I ordered the ground beef taco. The meat had absolutely no seasoning and was oily. The fry bread was not fully cooked and oily. The scant bit of lettuce that was put on the taco was wilted and brown. And the salsa the counter attendant raved about we couldn't try because the ketchup type bottle they put it in was sealed shut with gunk.  2 bites in and we left. Waste of money and now I have a stomach ache.

I really enjoyed this place. The pizza is exactly what you want (thin crust, mind you. If you want thick crust look elsewhere), and they don't charge by the topping which is great.  You can do the same with a salad.  This place gets CROWDED at lunch. I mean line up against the door or even out the door.  Take a dose of patience.

I've given this location a try twice. They screwed up both orders, once giving us a happy meal with an empty box where the nuggets should have been.  Skip it.

Just finished with the moving of all our big items. Paris and Damon were phenomenal!   My husband and I are terrible at moving and not everything got packed up (not easy to pack when you have newborn twins), but since we don't have to be out by a certain date we just had them take the biggest, heaviest items that my husband can't move alone, as well as disassembling my daughter's big, bulky wooden bunk bed.  They filled the uHaul and got everything moved in such a timely manner.  Thank you SO much for the hard work today!  **tip, reserve a bigger uHaul than you think you need because we ran out of space.

I tried this place with a couple of friends after getting a direct mail flyer. It is in the neighborhood and it sounded great.  I was NOT disappointed. The beer selection on tap is expansive, and the food is divine. We did all appetizers because everything looked amazing.  The ambiance was so inviting. You want to sit down, chat, and stay awhile.  If you are in the area, I recommend it.  We did, however, come at an off time. I have no idea what it is like during the busy times.

I really enjoyed my quiche.  Service was slow and we ordered croissants that we never got (they sold the last ones to someone after we ordered them). Frustrating, but we went back the next day and got some and they were to die for.  Take a dose of patience as there are only a couple of servers and they are also working the counter.    The ambiance is great, there is outdoor seating and I can't wait to try them for lunch or dinner.

I really like this place.  It is kid friendly during the day, and great for happy hour or late night drinks/eats with your friends.    The menu, while not huge, is really well planned out.   The staff is great, there are fun games to play, and good music is on all the time.  HIGHLY recommend!

This is the first time I've been out to lunch and able to find a parking space here. The lot is small for the amount of businesses in this shopping center, even with the dirt lot behind the building.  I had the Pick 2 with soup and a pasta. Very good. Good quality food, fast service, friendly staff.    I would recommend giving it a try.

I don't come in that often, but when I do I wonder why I bothered to walk in the door.  Every time I come in, the set up of the store has changed, product I have purchased before is no longer carried, and despite the turn-over of staff, the same snotty attitude is presented when I'm looking for assistance.

What a find!  This place knows how to make a custom pizza exactly perfect. I've called in orders twice now and the food is hot and ready when I get there. It travels well and tastes amazing.    They don't charge for each topping which is so nice! The price for the pizza is what you see.  Highly recommend.

I really enjoyed this restaurant. I came here to meet a friend for lunch and I was not disappointed. The atmosphere is charming and calm. The outdoor patio is roomy and the tables are large enough for 4 people to have a lovely meal al fresco.  I had the chicken sandwich and I feel it was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well.  I will be back.

We found this place last night thanks to Yelp (and my sis-in-law's review).  My husband really wanted a burger, but I could not stomach the thought of drive-thru.  After a quick review of the places near us, we bit the bullet and tried something new.  We ordered take out so I can't comment on the restaurant since I sent the Hubs to pick it up.  I did, however, call in the order. The guy on the phone was very nice.  I did almost have a heart attack when he said it was going to be $27 for 2 burgers and fries. Let me tell you, after sampling the fare, TOTALLY worth the price!!  I ordered the Chicken Parmesan chicken burger with Cheddar & Ale fries. OMG, delish!!  The chicken burger was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the flavor of the marinara and parmesan crisp mingled so well with it, and the brioche bun was light and flavorful. An excellent combination. Then the Cheddar & Ale fries were a delight. The fries by themselves were great. But the sauce was even better. My husband loved the fries but was not a fan of the Cheddar & Ale sauce, but he hates alcohol and it has a very beer finish (as it should since Ale is in the title).  So if you don't like alcohol, I don't recommend it.  He ordered the OMG burger and OMG he thought it was great. He usually can power through a double burger just about anywhere, but this was so big he couldn't finish. Unless you haven't eaten all day, the result may be the same for you. He recommends just get 1 patty and will do that in the future. But the flavor was great and it was perfectly cooked.  I wish I had tried a shake. The Creme Brulee shake sounded terrific, but I will be sure to try it on our next visit.

Great location, convenient to retail, the freeway and our neighborhood.   I have had great luck at this location. They are child-friendly, and have always managed to find a spot for us away from bar (at our request) so the kiddos don't bother anyone.  The selection is great on both the adult and kids menus. The staff is friendly, engaging with the kids and always refilling he drinks.

I really like this location, the staff and the selection. If I can't find what I am looking for, they will order it and have it sent to the store or my home.   Hubby LOATHES trying on clothes, I know his size and his taste, and let's face most girls love to shop. Depending on the day and the mood, I can be up for it. This way, too, I know he won't be running around in thread-worn clothes any longer than necessary.  The quality of the clothing is exceptional. And they really can make a tall (and big) guy look good!

Dr. Renee is wonderful! She is really helping get my neck back in shape.  She is incredibly smart, as gentle as she can be, and I feel does the least amount of manipulation to get the muscles and bones to do what they need to do. I like that! I've had chiropractors practically cripple me with their overly-aggressive manipulation.  Her staff is friendly and engaging.

There was a food truck event outside our office building today so a few of us thought we would check it out.  Out of the 3 trucks this one had what looked to be the quickest turnout of food. As it was crowded, and we were on a tight schedule we went with it. Big mistake!  2 of us ordered the Argentine quesadilla (steak, potato, spinach, grilled onion and chimichurri sauce). Neither of us received potato, the grilled onion was almost non-existent, there was no chimichurri sauce on mine, and my spinach turned out to be hot wilted lettuce - not to mention a random disgusting tomato that was not in the description. Plus they must have buttered the tortilla (which is so not needed) and it turned into a big greasy mess.  The steak had no flavor, there was very little cheese, and the whole thing took up almost my entire lunch hour just to get it and get back upstairs.  The salsa they had set out in little containers tasted exactly like the Macayo's jarred salsa I have in my fridge.  They had one person working the grill and one person taking orders. This is ineffient and created such a backup people were complaining.  Not only that, my order came out before about 10 other people who ordered before me and that started the group talking.  I am truly disappointed.  It was an absolute waste of $8.50 and 45 minutes.

I really do like Grabbagreen.  The downtown location is great for work, but it isn't the easiest to maneuver from the door to the counter and back out again. There is a lot of congestion with people waiting.   The food is delish, super healthy, and full of flavor. The portions, though, are a little skimpy for the price you pay.

Try the Harissa fries. They are life-changing.  The new location is great, though if you are trying to have a conversation on the patio, the light rail gets mighty loud.

I was very impressed by the restaurant, the staff and the food. I found this place by chance after doing a Yelp search for restaurants that took reservations (Friday night and a babysitter, I wasn't going to waste my night waiting for a table to clear up at a restaurant). I've been by this place several times a week since it opened and never noticed it.  Since I had the opportunity for an all too rare date night with the hubs, I did a quick check of the menu and called the restaurant for a reservation.  We arrived a little early for our 7:30 reservation figuring we would have to wait, but we were surprised to be led right to our table.  We had about a 5 minute wait before we could order our drinks, but both our waitress and the bartender stopped by the table to let us know they would be right with us. It was refreshing!  I tried their Blueberry Smash and their White Cosmo, my hubs had the iced tea.  The smash was delish! Crisp and slightly sweet. The Cosmo probably would have been better if I hadn't had the smash first. It tasted a bit more tart than I think I was ready for after rum and fruit, but that was my fault.  It was very good, but I probably shouldn't have mixed flavors.  We ordered the Pepper Glazed Goat Cheese for an appetizer. I loved the bubbly goat cheese, but I wasn't a fan of the peppadew relish. It was too sweet for my taste, but I can see how the sharp of the goat cheese and the sweet of the relish would be wonderful for someone that likes that. My husband loved it.    While we were waiting for the appetizer, the hostess brought us complimentary roasted Brussels sprouts. Someone had ordered them and changed their mind and they didn't want them to go to waste. I had been talking about ordering them on the ride over, but since my hubs is not a fan of the sprouts we opted to look at another option. So this was a win-win for me. They were crispy, and so full of flavor.  I ended up dipping a few in the goat cheese (sans relish) and it was a little slice of heaven. There are big chunks of bacon and roasted garlic throughout and they were like little treasures to be found.  The hubs ordered the Gnocchi & Short Ribs. They were cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and the rib meat was so tender it almost melted under the weight of the fork. He is already asking when we get to go back.  I had the crab cakes. They were seasoned well, but I wish there had been a smidgen more of the aioli. I was using it on both the crab cakes and the parm fries the dish comes with. YUM! The dish also comes with cole slaw, something I was not planning on liking as it is usually overdressed, mayonaisey or sweet. This one was perfect. Very lightly dressed, it had a nice tang and the cabbage was very crunchy and cold.   We also tried the Tres Leche cake on recommendation of both the hostess and our waitress. It was sinful. The salted caramel, which I'm usually not a big fan of, was perfect with the cool whipped cream and the hot cake. It was a balanced flavor sensation. Every tastebud had something to be excited about.  I would highly recommend this place. I would also recommend making a reservation if you are going to go on a Friday night. The place was packed, the bar was packed, and there was a couple who left the waiting area because there was a wait.   There is a patio I can't wait to sit on during a crisp fall evening, the bar has several TV's with sports (hubs was happy), and they have 2 private dining rooms for events.  I'm looking forward to a return visit.

I was taken here for a lunch meeting and I was impressed. We were seated quickly on the patio and we were able to enjoy a conversation without it being too noisy, which surprised me. It is right on 3rd Street, after all.  The area is really nice, with a coffee bar, a bar, a restaurant, and a lovely outdoor area where they seem to have games set up (I assume for happy hour).  The food was good and it had a really nice variety of sandwiches, salads and entrees for the lunch hour.

No better coffee anywhere!  The service was fast, the staff were friendly, and the coffee, well that is why I drive out of my way to find a Dutch Bros.  I really hope they open one in mid-town Scottsdale. The Papago Plaza store, while great, gets SLAMMED every time.

I can say without a shadow of a doubt this was probably one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had in my life. To start with the prices are ridiculous. $30 for two sandwiches, two chips and soup.  The bread was the worst sandwich bread I've had.  I don't know if they overmixed it's, over proofed it, or under baked it. Whatever they did to it it was pretty bad.   And their so-called famous meatballs were the most bland pieces of tough meat I have had in a very long time. Their zesty sauce has zero zest and was too sweet for my liking. It was huge flavorless mess of hot, sweet tomato sauce and meat boulders.  The soup was gray. I ordered broccoli cheese and it was gray. It smelled terrible, and had a chemical taste. I'm glad I tasted it first. I ordered it for my toddlers and I would not feed it to them. I am sick to my stomach.  I will not be returning.

I really REALLY enjoy MAD Greens. I've been to 3 locations now and this one is my favorite (mostly because it is super close to my house and I don't have to deal with terrible parking at the 7th Ave & McDowell location).  I like the bigger store and the friendly staff. I brought my sister for the first time this past Monday, along with my twin toddlers. SO much yummy happened. The boys loved the potato soup - they were dunking the pita bread in it and making yummy sounds so I will assume that is love :-) And my sister was amazed to find out that the salad she created was so healthy (she looked it up on an online calculator).  I love how fresh everything is, how clean everything is, and the variety.  I prefer the setup at this location above the 7th Ave location. Here you can see all the ingredients. There, they are and you are not able to see everything.  Plus the parking at Hilton Village is so easy.

I love this place. It is so fresh, healthy, and tasty. The soup selection is nice (4-6 per day) and they change.  The salads are killer. Why? Because you choose EXACTLY what you want.  This place is fast (provided you can find parking nearby, which is VERY difficult).   Oh and try the Horseradish Ranch. Lovely!

I may never go willingly to another theater. I felt so spoiled. I booked the tickets online, selected the seats, had an easy check-in, and the seats themselves were great.  The food and drink options were pretty good (though still movie theater pricey). And they have a bar!! The view from the lobby is pretty neat and everyone was very friendly.  I highly recommend seeing a movie at this location.

Wow, I've been here about 4 times in 2 weeks. Doesn't help that we took all the kids the first time and now the oldest literally asks every night if we can go back.  The flavors are amazing. The first night I had the white chocolate raspberry and the coffee flavor (I forget now what they call it exactly). They were terrific. The flavors are very strong and taste real. The coffee tasted like a terrific cup of coffee with cream and sugar. And the raspberry was a strong, natural taste, while the white chocolate did not over power the rest.  My husband had the watermelon sorbet and it tasted just like taking a fresh slice of watermelon out of the freezer.  The second time I had a homemade roasted marshmallow on top of my sundae and it was divine. The smell is a little intense at first with the burning sugar, but the flavor was terrific.   I would highly recommend seeking out this tiny gem. They have standard flavors as well as creative ones (my favorite name so far is the Netflix and Chill). I've met both owners and they really seem to enjoy what they do and the people they meet.
