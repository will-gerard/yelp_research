I went to an event  hosted at Hotel San Carlos and found the appetizers tasty, nothing special but basic.  The drinks were made well, the room was clean and relaxing, the service was nice and personable.  I think it is a great spot in downtown Phoenix for a social party/gathering!    I have never stayed in the hotel, so this review is strictly in the event category.    Hotel San Carlos, has great charm and attentive employees.

University Club is a membership club in central Phoenix. I do not have a membership but have attended meetings and a wedding at the club as a guest in the past.   You can go on-line to see rates for this under "membership".   The wedding, we attended was a while ago but I distinctively remember how beautiful it was out on outside garden. The ceremony and dinner was outside and it was gorgeous. It almost felt like we were not in Phoenix, but removed far far away in some plush other land with greens and plants surrounding us! The food was catered by University Club and was delicious. I remember the staff being kind.   As for the meetings I have attended inside the club, they were very nice as well. Nothing fancy dancy over the top, but had a lot of old Phoenix charm. The club is an old renovated 1917 house and each of the dining rooms are parts of the house, it's really neat. It's like being in someones home but not.   Go to the website and check out the photos!  http://www.universityclubphoenix.com/

Collier Center  The best way to get in and out of this place is to call your order in and pick it up.  If you don't work in the Collier Center or anywhere near, parking can be a real pain.    The sandwiches are always good, the cookies are always tasty.  The staff can be a bit iffy but it's obvious that the place gets slammed at lunch time and it's a bit of chaos.  It's only opened M-F 6:30a-4p

The husband and I used to like coming to Mi Amigos when we first started dating b/c we would see a lot of movies, you know go on movie dates, these dates are pretty funny b/c you don't have to actually talk to your date for a good duration of the date-- it's so brilliant!   But this is also why "dinner and a movie" is so popular.    So we would have some dinners at Mi Amigo's until the frightful night.  The night we ate at Mi Amigos and I ordered the tamale for the first time (usually I stick with tacos at Mexican food restaurants and I just love tacos).  It was delicious and I enjoyed every last bit of that tamale.  We go to the movie, he drops me off at home, I go to bed and am up at 4am with the taste of tamales in my mouth.  I feel like I might have indigestion, but NO. NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO-- I had my very first date with food poisoning.    You know the drill on this so I won't go into detail.  I can't give the place one star b/c of all the other times we went and had 2-3 star  food and decent service.  So I gave 2 stars but told you all that I got food poisoning here.  It really should be 1.5 stars.  The  worst part is I can never eat another tamale again, ever.  .

Something about The Old Spaghetti Factory that I love and then really don't like, not sure what exactly it is.  The pastas are just okay but other things on the menu are good.  The ambiance is fun and family feeling.   Maybe it's because the food is just okay but I want it to be better because I want to like the place.  It's holds some nostalgic memories for me as well as the the quirky atmosphere that some would call old, but I like it. It  makes me enjoy actually being there, maybe not eating there though.   This is a pretty lame review actually.  What was the point of this?  Not sure.

Envision this........ slices of warm pastrami piled HIGH on top of your choice of bread (mine is the Rye) with perfectly melted cheese on top with a crunchy pickle.    This is one of my new favorite heart stopping lunches to have when I am work.  I have not been here more than 3 times BUT I think about Downtown Deli all the time.  Some workies enjoy the giant hot dogs and other meaty treats.  This isn't somewhere to eat everyday, it needs to be viewed as a treat considering it isn't the healthiest of choices but it sure tastes gooooooood.  Downtown Deli is in a good location situated downtown (how clever is that?!)  The staff is friendly and the place is bustling with business at the lunch hour.  They are quick, they know how to get you and out in your lunch hour or lunch half hour.

A couple people told me that I would not like this place, but I did!  I liked it a lot actually.  I was smitten by the decor- super modern and clean and done right.  You know when people make their spaces look so modern it ends up just looking cheap... this place is not it.  The front door was a bit scary, if you don't watch your kids or immature friend or family members closely, it is possible that they could sever their body in half vertically.  Anyhow, I had the chicken roll ups, they were good.  The food is like food you can fix at home if you put some effort in it ( this means more than using the microwave or picking up take out and putting it on a plate).  The pita chips were very tasty too.  We got some of those.  The salads look big and green and healthy- the way a salad should look.  I plan to go back and I plan to get something different to try.  Neat concept, this Zoes.

Nothing like a touch of yogurt on a hot (or cold) day.  The owners are so friendly, I love it.  The smell of sugar cones wafting in the air when you walk in is heavenly.  Something about this yogurt here, I don't know what it is but it tastes so good and creamy and not a chemically tone to them at all.  It tastes real, fresh and plopping down inside is a perfect way to enjoy some time away from the office and watch the busy-ness going on around you outside.

Um, yum!  This place is a great spot for lunch if you work in the downtown, mid-town, uptown Phoenix area.  I chose a hamburger and fries, even though I love gyros, but it was one of those days where a burger and fry were just needed for me to continue with my day.    The environment is a large open area of basic tables and chairs, it looks like it gets really busy around lunch time so maybe not the best kept up dining room but people move through pretty quickly.   The menu is MASSIVE-- we are talking, they have pretty much anything to satisfy your hunger.  They even had a variety of low carb options which is a big menu choice these days.  ( i really need to get back to low carb)  Staff is really nice.  We'll be back without a doubt.

I drive by Rosita's all the time-- and have never stopeed to go in... until 2 days ago and I am so glad I did.  It looks really tiny from McDowell but actually it is a pretty decent size.  I ordered the good ol standby: beef taco and cheese enchilada and rice.  I was very pleased with my meal.  It was affordable and tasty.  I will go back again.  The only drawback is the pond inside-- things like that skeeve me out. Service was normal, food came quickly (like most Mexican food places) and the chips were good- warm when delivered and the salsa was great!

I love you, That's A Wrap!  Not only is the food great tasting, the names of the food are great sounding!  I prefer the Greek Gatsby and Cypress salad, but love to say:  Foo Man Chew Tipper and Alba-Gore Tuna Gringo Star The Veggie Jackson  and the list goes on.... go see for yourself and walk away feeling full and like you got your money's worth.

I had to take a star away.  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken rice bowl and was very disappointed, it tasted really strange and really soggy.  My co-worker said it best, he said it tasted like a frozen meal heated.   I'll stick with the 5 star wraps and salads and leave the 2.5 star bowls for them to keep.

If Ranch Market is not your thing-- then you are missing out on some really great things.    1.  Chips  (as in chips and salsa)-- they make their own tortilla chips that are only 99cents for a bag.  I brought them to a work party and everyone liked me more than the day before.  2. Birthday cakes for kiddies--- wow- talk about a frickin' cool Dora the Explorer cake, or a Spongebob cake-- it put Costco and Aunt Cindy to shame.  3.  Meat-- this meat case is LOADED, even if you don't want to buy fresh meat, just go there to look at it.   4.  The affordabiltiy-- C&H Sugar was $1.19 at Ranch Market and $2.99 at any other grocery (non sale priced).    It's like a party in this place, the last time I was there was right before the holidays and I found myself just having a good ol' time grabbing the chips for a work party.  I even stopped by the jewelry counter and contemplated purchasing a 3 inch gold cross, but decided against it.  :o)

I love this place--- just walking through Red makes me feel like I am in a time warp.  It's so chic and cool.  I instantly needed a dirty martini (extra olives please!) and a ciggy.    We found some really great pieces we liked that would work perfectly in our home.  And some we fell in LOVE with other stuff but have not purchased.  It is pricey but they are like pieces of fine art.  It is Eames-era heaven.  There is the most beautiful desk I have ever seen and other pieces that just left me in awe.  If this is your style, you need to go to Red.

These ladies know how to do flowers.  Starting, on the phone- so accommodating and willing to work within budgets.  I used them for work and had a strict budget to follow and they did it perfectly for 14 orders and deliveries.  Very nice and easy to work with.  Then I had to go to the store and drop off something that had to be included in the delivery.  What a great store-- some really great decorating ideas are in there.   I highly recommend Cactus Flower.  I will use them again.

The quickest lunch in town.  We timed it.... 4 minutes from ordering to it arriving.  Not sure if this is good or bad in some people's eyes but good when you are lunching on a work day and need to get back to the office.  The lunch special prices are phenomenal -- I always get the mongolian beef, it's huge and delicious.  You get soup, your meal, rice and an egg roll. All for under 10 bucks (with a drink) and maybe even tax.   I love China Chili, something about the colorful disco balls in the giant dining area and the curtness of everyone-- it makes me love it even more.  They do takeout too and it's excellent as well!

Married or dating a Comic Book Nerd?  Here is the perfect place to purchase a gift certificate for that special person in your life.    The staff is always so nice here.  I only go when I need to purchase a GC for the hub, it's even bagged and boarded!   The parking is a bit tricky, be careful when trying to leave.... you have to semi reverse onto Central if you don't plan accordingly.

Um Hello!  there is a CHICKEN on the corner of the street "advertising" Le Peep-- this is Awesome.  Awesome, I tell ya.  The poor guy in the summer must hate his life but right now, it can't be bad.  i really enjoy this place, the golf decor is odd, like it wants to have the golf theme but the budget ran out so they just stopped but whatever, a breakfast place shouldn't be rated by the decor.  the only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is b/c the staff seem maybe a bit off-- like it's everyone's bad day.... maybe it's too early to work?  I like the food, it tastes like breakfast I would make at home without all the dishes and the mess.  Basic breakfast food, nothing out of this world, but homey and breakfasty-- is this a word?  I want to try lunch here but never seem to make it.

Write-ons is a girls dream come true.  Wait, I take that back... it's a girly girl's dream come true.  High end stationary and gifts for all the loved ones in life.  Not just stationary, but house warming type gifts, of candles, journals, kn-icky knacks, appetizer plates, party supplies and all sorts of fun stuff!   We ordered our wedding invitations here... they have a wide variety of choices in all budgets.  We were impressed with the selection.  We have not received our invites yet, they should be ready in about 10 days.   I am so excited to see how they turned out!

What a great lunch!  I had the pastrami sandwich on rye and it was HUGE and perfect--- I've had pastrami sandwiches all over the state and I think Scott's is my favorite, second is Carnegie in NY.    I didn't order any sides but my lunch buddies did and the fries were good.  Fruit was so-so-- Scott's isn't really the fruit side kinda place.  Service was quick (which is great on a work day!), friendly and the place as busy but not overly crowded.   The deli cases looked really good on the way out too!

I had my makeup done for a speaking engagement.  It was a gift from a friend so I am not sure how much the services run but I have to say that I was very happy with the outcome!   I've only had my makeup done professionally a few times in my life (minus the quick touch ups from department store counters).  I wasn't a cake face mess (this was a huge fear) and it stayed all day.  I liked it so much that I even bought some custom foundation afterwards.  It was under $30 for the foundation and it looks like it will last for a long time.  I don't normally ever wear it, but I really liked the stuff they used on me, it felt natural and really evened out my skin tone.  I recommend Palmina Leone, wish I could get my face done more often!

We went for the Valentines Day dinner.  It was cute, really nice and more food in one sitting than I have had in a long time.  It was pricey but worth it in my eyes.  We brought our own wine we purchased in Sonoma and were saving for a special night.  Service was wonderful.  The ambiance is romantic and sweet.  The brie was so good, I could have just eaten the entire plate and been completely satisfied but of course, I had soup, the main dish, dessert and wine.    Great place for a romantic date.

I am a total fan of Century Branch.... I most like how EASY it is to park, get in and get out.  This is a TINY TINY library, really not a whole lot to it.  But the staff is very nice and helpful.  I put my books on hold on-line and always pick up from Century Branch b/c of the easy no-fuss access to this library.   I also seem to find better audio book selections from this branch as well, I think it's a great place to return items to b/c of the location.  So I can always fill my audio book addiction easily!  SUPPORT YOUR LIBRARY!!!

Saturday: 11am-2:30: all you can eat sushi is only $16.95  pretty darn good sushi too.  not busy, you get a seat easily.  Nice but not a scene-- which is how I like to dine on sushi.  I have had better but at this price, this is as good as it will ever get!    I've only had sushi here, so I don't know what the other food is like, but the other tables had non-sushi meals and they looked good, big portions.    www.mrmotorising.com

Marshall's Rocks.  I love coming by here to pick up any house stuff, stationary, decorations, wrapping supplies like gift bags, fancy soaps-- just a bunch of stuff I don't NEED but like to BUY.  The shoe department is sad but the clothes are a great deal and lots of variety, you just have to go looking thru everything.  SO if you have the time, it's worth it.  But basically I purchase house stuff and crap I don't need and then I go home and look at it all and wonder why I just spent all this money of "stuff"-- but I get the shopping rush at a bargain price. What more can you ask for?

CHIPS and SALSA (2 kinds) and BEAN DIP all while you wait for your food.  Don't bother ordering appetizers, the chips and dips will satisfy you.  If you like margaritas, order the jumbo marg and sit in the nice air conditioned room.  Arriba is Mexican food, nothing fancy with a twist- just good ol' Mexican food.  You know the kind you eat and say "why oh why did I just eat all that?".  I come here ever so often.  I had the carnitas just recently and was was very happy with my meal.  Have Fun!  Prices range anywhere bettwen $9-$15ish.

A bit on the pricey side but still one of my favortie sandwich shops in Phoenix.  I am not giving 5 stars b/c I sometimes feel ripped off but I continue to go to Duck & Decanter.    2 words: PATIO PLATTER  The Patio Platter is like heaven in front of your face, you get to pick a meat and cheese assortment with crackers and bread.  I swear if I am the only person in there, it takes 30 minutes to get the platter and if there are 50 people in there, it takes 30 minutes to get the platter--- I suppose consistency is good.  It's worth the wait (and weight) -- it so delicious!  The little shop inside is fun to pick up a few interesting gifts, it's overpriced but sometimes they have 20% off sales on everything in the shop that isn't edible....   The Duck will forever be a place I like to enjoy sitting outside with either an iced tea or a glass of wine with friends n  family and nosh on some yummy food.

Easy Living in Swizzle Inn.  A great dive bar to hang out.  Bring some friends and settle down for a night of drinking and and and... drinking.  The locals seem nice enough and the whole place has a lot to take in, from the funny bumper stickers decorating the inner bar area to the dudes playing pool and I think I saw Golden Tee in there or was it The Claw?? Hard to remember, like I said, settle down for some drinking and more drinking.

Talk about great customer service and affordable prices!   It's a non-chain mom and pop jeweler hidden in an off the beaten path stip mall.  It is really perfect!  You get complete one on one and they are willing to work within any budget.  No pressure to buy and just a great experience.    It is nice looking at wedding bands when there aren't 15 other brides around you doing the same thing-- it makes you feel more special.  I recommend Burland.  HIGHLY.

I have not written a review lately for Burland, as I have returned on many occasion since 2007.  Burland continues to offer the personal service you deserve.  The selection is different, not the run of the mill jewelry, they have choices that are so spectacular that you had no idea THAT is exactly what you want and you won't expect to see it on others the next day.  And you can expect to pay a fair price.   If you like the no pressure, relaxed shopping experience, then I recommend you stop by Burland.  You will be glad you did.  You can even make a wish list!  So should your better half stop by, there is some reference if needed :)   I can't say enough good things about Burland.

Okay, so it looks like this place is hit and miss and I have an idea why.........  because people have different expectations on this whole car wash thing.  So if you are super picky and have so many valuables in your car, why not just wash it yourself?  I mean, these people are sweating balls washing your car and you only paid 7.99-- good lord, I would barely clean the inside too if it was 117 degrees and I get a 50 cent tip from the a-hole in his mom's BMW.  I hear people complain about Danny's in person not necessarily from YELP-- so this rant is for those that can't even voice their opinion on here.  But anyhow....  My car is WAY CLEANER when I leave than it was before I got there and that alone makes me hap-hap-happy.   I also got paint balled recently and the cleaner I used messed my paint up pretty badly, Danny's fixed it for me for the bargain price of $79.99 (is this a bragain????) and they shampooed the carpets too.  I'm just happy the paint isn't forever ruined now.  I hate HS kids.

Roland hit the nail on the head here.... BREAD.  Bread is the most import part of Italian Sandwiches.  Niccoli's has it to perfection.  Everything about Niccoli's reminds me of my Italian neighborhood in Toronto where speaking in English was never needed at the local market, doctors, bakeries, service shops, or church.  It was little Italy.    Niccoli's has some of the best tasting food in town and it is locally onwed-- which is very nice.  PLUS, it's next to Burland Jewelry.... so pick up a Mortadella Sandwich AND some diamond studded earrings all  in one stop = HEAVEN ;o)

THIS PLACE IS IT!  The basement bar is like no other in Phoenix!  Gives a new meaning to hunkering down.  The food is delicious, the ambiance is just right.  Dark, comfortable and makes you want to stay.  They offer "Small plates" so you can try a different assortment of foods.  OR have a "bigger plate" for a full meal.  I had the skewers on my last visit and I think I will order them again.  SUPERB!

I can never turn down NYPD- NEVER! So, like Allison said, what's up with the Pepsi product?  I prefer Coke as well.  But since this review is about the food, I give 5 Stars.  The pizza is pretty darn good.  I prefer the straight up pepperoni but when I am feeling meaty, I like the Brookly Family with the sausage and pepperoni.    The atmosphere is very casual and laid back, perfect for shoving pizza down your throat.

L'Occitane en Provence is my go to shop for many beauty products.  First off, the products are cruelty free and totally lux.  I have few favorite smells that I must wear and one of them is L'Occitane's Green Tea spray-- it is magical.  Other items are that are to die for: Shea Butter Hand Cream Cherry Blossom Lotion Immortelle under eye cream Marseille Soaps  These items can only be purchased in a L'Occitane.  Shopping inside is like being taken away into a whole little vacation world.  If you have never been inside a L'Occitane, let me recommend that you must stop by at least once-- you'll be running back for more.  It sure helps that the shops employees are always so nice and friendly and want to give you samples of stuff.  Every store I've been to in different states and they are consistently helpful and friendly.    I love L'Occitane!

I like Jamba Juice.  I like this particular location as well.  Like Alicia, the place was JAMbING loud with music-- like really loud, like I thought I turned into my parent's b/c I almost wanted to say, "Can you turn the music down, it's hurting my ears."  I bit my tongue and anxiously awaited for my Orange-A-Peel.  It was good.  It was exactly what I expected and wanted at that very moment.   Clean, nice staff, good smoothie.  Just loud.

Sell you designer duds here... I basically bring my good clothes here (ie: not the crap I get from Old Navy and Marshalls) to consign.  I let the money collect and then go in and collect on it before I go on a a vacation- VOILA! instant petty cash for a trip!  It really depends on what you being in, I have had $200 sitting waiting for me.  It's great.  It's consignment so they look at your stuff (mostly they look at the labels), keep what they want and then weeks later you stop by and see what sold and get the money for it, they keep a good chunk of it.  You have the choice for more money to be spent back in the store (trade) or get the cash.    I've never actually bought anything here though.

A vacuum center almost seems so outdated or something, considering, we live in a world where if the vacuum breaks, you go buy a new one.  Even if it is a Dyson.  Well, I can be super frugal and there was no way I was buying another vacuum when the one that needed fixing was over $400 to start out with. But over 7 years later, the Dyson needed some repairs.  $100 later after a trip to ABC Vacuum, the Dyson Animal is working like it is brand new again!  It came back fixed, cleaned and in PERFECT condition.  I highly recommend ABC Vacuum.  Quick service done right!

My Sister's Attic is related to My Sister's Closet.  I have only taken furniture, paintings, housewares, stuff like that here to consign- not purchased anything although I always want to buy stuff here.  It's consignment.  SO you will get your money, after it sells.  It's like a higher end garage sale.... you can find some really great stuff.  I recommend it for anyone who wants to sell there nicer stuff and get meaningful money back.

I purchased  2 King's Cakes for Fat Tuesday (work party).  I was originally going to actually make the cakes myself until I thought to call Barb's Bakery.  I drive by there all the time and see the cute sign with the muffin for an "a" in Barb's name.  They had king cakes and not too pricey!  So I went over and picked them up.... I could just sit in the bakery and sniff the air for a living but since I have a theory that smelling something good instantly makes my thighs fatter, I will pass.  The King Cakes were tasty (so I hear).  I want to go back and get some cookies or something to see how those taste.   4 stars for Barb's!

Houston's is consistent.  The burger always tastes like the burger it was when I was in high school.  It is one of my favorites in town.  The french fries are the crispiest I have ever had, they are shoestring.  Not many people do shoestring anymore, probably b/c they'll clog all your arteries in one serving.  One thing I don't like about Houston's is that they do no accept reservations with 5 or more people-- that is lame.  We had to wait for a table for awhile but we sat out on the patio and enjoyed beverages, so that was nice.  It wasn't so hot yet that it didn't feel like torture. But it will be torture next weekend.   Another meal I always enjoy is the rotisserie chicken and the vegetable plate.  I wish I could prepare a vegetable plate like that at home b/c then maybe I would eat more veggies.   Service is always good.  The dark atmosphere is very relaxing as well.

This is the mutha load of the Peter Piper Pizza Arcade.  We are talking spending $40 on skeetball and "bop the frog"-- easily.  To be completely honest, not that I am a PPP connoisseur, this location at Tower Plaza has the best pizza of all the PPP.  They sell beer too.  And it's cheap and just when you crave that card-boardy crust and minimal sauce with really greasy cheese, this place seems to get it just right and I like it and I am not afraid to admit it.  thankyouverymuch

I had lunch at Wally's on a day when I wanted to eat healthier--- let's just say, that day was shot I had to call for a do-over the next day.  But oh, my Wally Burger was good!   Very laid back and easy going, I will return.  It's been awhile, but I will return.   We sat on the patio and I really enjoyed the casual-ness.  It's hidden, so you  have to go look for it.  44th/Camelback on the NE corner shopping center.   See you there!

Good Times are had at Dilly Dally and if not, then you just have not drank enough.  And just when you think you have hit rock bottom, go next door and order wings and eat them in the parking lot and put the chicken bones in your purse.  NOW, you have hit rock bottom.

So disappointing.  I do not know what happened to this place... it has progressively gotten worse over time.  I ordered the Mongolian Beef with brown rice-- my very favorite and it didn't taste very good.  It was okay- but just not as good as usual.  The 2 star is for my dish and the zero stars are for my fiance's soppy noodle mess called Chicken lo mein--- ewwwwwwwwww!  I think Ramen noodles tasted better and cost only 11 cents.  They were so mooshy that they barely could stay on the fork-- really gross.  They were tasteless.  We threw it out.     Pei Wei-- I miss the good times.

I wanted breakfast that didn't require a long wait or making it myself.  I was probably off best by just sucking it up and making breakfast at home because Lantana Grille was pretty disappointing. We arrived and thought the place was actually closed because there was not a single car in the parking lot and when we walked in, there was no hostess.  But we saw some people sitting so I asked if we just seat ourselves and they replied with "Sure!"-- I guess that is what I would say too if someone asked me mid breakfast at Lantana Grille what to do upon walking in.  There was a large party in the back, they mentioned that they were in town for a wedding so I am guessing they must have walked over from the Pointe Hotel.  (this explained no cars in the lot).  It is set up like a breakfast buffet, you pay $15 or $16/person and eat whatever in the buffet.  The choices are limited and not that good.  The best part was the made to order omlets and that is it.  Even the sauasage and bacon seemed to taste off.  HOW does that happen?  So the buffet had scrambled eggs (don't eat those-ick), sausage, bacon, french toast, syrup, cereal, fruit.  oh and the omlets-- best bet are the omlets.   Service was slow, only one gal running around for the whole place and even though not busy when we got there, there was still a huge group in the back, a small group up front and us.  Then another large group came in as we were finishing up.  I just wanted to get out of there.

I finally stopped at Jana's Bakery today on this fine Mother's Day to buy some dessert treats for Mother's Day dinner.  I kinda wish I stopped somewhere else.  The desserts I picked out: Coffee Cake Slice Marzipan 2 heart shaped Mom's Day cakes  All were dry and flavorless except for the sugar.  I was so disappointed in this.  When I walked in, everything looked so good, I would have never imagined the taste would not live up to the image.  The only thing I can think is that I purchased everything at noon and we didn't eat it until 6:45, but still it shouldn't have been that bad in that amount of time.  I saw some other cakes and such that where not cut, full cakes-- I feel like those might be better?  We'll see.  I might try it out again and see if I just happend to go on a bad day?  I hope so.

HAPPY CINCO DE MAYO!  Here is where I celebrated my Cinco.  With 5 rolled tacos, how could you go wrong?  The 5 beauties were lined up in a row with quacamole, cheese and shredded lettuce all plopped on top, it was delish!  Not that any of these place  can boast cleanliness, neither can this place BUT- you get it to go.  Eat it at home and you are A-OK.

Eyebrow? Want 2 Eyebrows? Go to Lee.  She is by far THE BEST EYEBROW WAX I have ever encountered.  I've gone to her for 5 years now and I have never been disappointed.  Don't believe me?  Look at my pictures... those brows would connect if Lee did not take good care of me (thanks, Italian genes!!)   I also get my manis and pedis here-- WONDERFUL!  Clean, friendly and affordable.    The pedicure chairs are to die for and it is very relaxing.  I would never go any other place than My Nail Salon.  *** Note:  Lee does not baby or pamper you in waxing, it is strictly, wax, rip --ouch-- move on..... she does do this forehead beating/massage quickly after wards-- it can be startling at first-- just a warning.  The outcome is flawless though.

There is no reason to go out for burgers anymore.... all you need is the Whole Foods Cowboy Burger from the Meat Dept and grill them up at home.  Delicious.    WholeFoods is always the place I go when I need something very specific and I an only find here OR where I go when I needs something very special.   Tammie Coe Cookies, Homemeade Tortilla Chips Salad Bar Vital Wheat Gluten (for bread making) Meats and Fish  I really love when they ask if you need your groceries iced for your drive.  It so thoughtful and SMART, especially when living in Phoenix.

Shea Village Lanes ROCKS!  The staff is super nice and the alley is clean.  I mean that is really all you can ask for with bowling alleys.  I have never had the food at this one so I can't comment on that.  But I have used the ladies restroom and it was tidy, big plus in my book.  It's been sort of  updated.  Bowling alleys will always be a bit behind in the modern look but I like it that way to tell you the truth.  Shea Village is kinda hidden on the NW corner of Shea & 32nd St.  You won't see the building right away but you will see the sign, so look for that.   And have Fun!

I grew up at this library.  And now I am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library.  They have a great selection of audio books.  I am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be!   Clean, safe, you are not bothered by stranger dangers.  I dig this library.

I am so glad I stopped into Home Fabrics!  It is located right next to Discount Tire on 32nd St/Cactus.  Rather than sitting in the tire shop (that smell in tire shops give me a headache), I went over to Home Fabrics.  They sell rugs too, beautiful rugs and the price is amazingly cheap!!  Like $50 -$100 for huge high quality rugs.  I didn't buy one YET, but I plan to head back and pick one up once I decide exactly which one I need.  The fabrics are an even better deal!  I signed up for their newsletter and email alerts and get info about sales and classes.  I don't know how to sew, but I know how to use a hot glue gun.  Maybe this is my year to learn?

I heard they sell the Westin Heavenly Bed (well, the version of it) and they do and we bought it Sunday at 5:30pm, they said they could deliver it that night!  HOLY COW!  That's awesome.  Even though we had it delivered the next day, we were very impressed with the same day delivery option.  Michael Christie was our guy, he was knowledgable and professional.  Not a salesy type of guy and we liked that about him.    There were many options to choose from in all price ranges.  As we were matress shopping, we found it a bit odd to be laying around on different mattresses in public and discussing what we liked and didn't like about each one-- but in Mattress Firm, it wasn't as odd feeling as some of the other stores we hit up that day.  Buying a new mattress feels like the best thing we have done in a long time.... the one we picked out is AWESOME so far.  The price is pretty hard to beat BUT if we see that exact same mattress for a cheaper price at their store or any other store, they will refund the difference PLUS 10%.    The delivery guys set it up in less than 15 minutes and gave us the 5-8pm time slot and arrived just a bit after 5pm-- loved that.  I hate sitting around and waiting and waiting.  If all goes well, we won't need to buy a new one in at least 15 years so let's hope I don't review another mattress store until then.  BTW, the Heavenly Bed knock off is a Simmons Beautyrest Classic.  They say it is the same bed but without the Westin tags on it.  We got the upgraded one for a bit more firmness and the pillowtop.  I want to lay on it all day.    Sweet Dreams.

l have been to various Bath & Body Works all over the US, but this one at PV Mall is the one I visit most frequently.  All products are cruelty-free and absolutely smell divine.  They have a huge variety of lotions and potions, soaps, fragrances for home and even carry an entire men's line.  Bath & Body Works not only as the cutest packaging, they also have all sorts of sales and coupons available year round to make sure you get the best deal.  My favorite lip glosses and balms from C.O. Bigelow are carried here as well as the entire Patrica Wexler face care line.    This place is awesome.

I am between 3 and 4 stars here actually.  Every time I come to this location, they don't have the items stocked in the store that are in the advertisement.  I do love the coupons though and I like that I can find killer deals on shampoo and conditioner.   It's fun to just peruse the isles and see what they have.  The staff is usually pretty friendly but then they tell me EVERY single time I pay at the register, "You are approved for 2 free issues of Instyle, would you like me to have those delivered to your home?"--- Approved?  I guess it's a good marketing thing that works for them b/c they have been asking this for over a year now I think.  I actually get to tell the truth and say, "I already have a subscription, but thanks!"

oh the bulk bins.... I love the bulk pins but I hate them all at the same time.  I love that it is so cheap and tasty but I hate that all it takes is one quick cough or sneeze and you can take home Lucy Lu Lu's cold.  iick-- okay, I won't focus on that.  This particular Spouts got an entire face lift on the outside so it is looking really great.  The prices are hard to beat and the employees all seem helpful and nice.  Sprouts is what I call "alternative" shopping.  It's not the main-steam store but it should be, just need to get more into the habit of stopping by here.  It's just easier sometimes to go the big grocers b/c I know they will always have what I am looking for and a larger selection.  But in the big scheme of things, Sprouts has everything you need- just need to get past the whole "variety" thing.    The prepared foods are a good price too and tasty.  I've tried different entrees and was pleased by all of them.  The bath and body section make me feel euphoric just by walking thru the isle, like I was so natural or something.

BARF BARF BARF  Quite possibly the grossest food I have ever eaten.  The chicken lo mien was made with spam-ish meat product-- Does that make is Spamish meat product lo mien? I ended up eating just white rice and soy sauce with egg rolls--- can't mess up fried egg rolls right?  I did have to salt them though, they were pretty taste-less.   The ambiance is less than desirable as well, our plates never got cleared and the amount of unshowered people sitting near me made me want to go home and take a hot bath with all the soap in the world.    I will not return to Lim's and I suggest you not go either.

HELLO CARB LOADERS!  This is your place to eat all the bagels you want.  What a yum-tastic bagel they serve.  I grew up on Chompie's bagels (this explains a lot). There is something about the chewy moistness of the inside and the outside that feels and tastes toasted even though it's not.   Grocery stories sell them now but they really are not nearly as good as the FRESH ones in the actual Chompie's establishment.

32nd St/ Greenway location  Had great luck at this location for a used elliptical machine--- good prices and they deliver!  They have a wide variety of ellipticals, treadmills, stationary bikes and a variety of weight room type stuff.  As well as sporting equipment.  This location is a good place to find used and new items for affordable prices!  It's also environmentally friendly since you are purchasing a previously owned item!   Staff was friendly and knowledgeable--  while in there, I saw staff helping a family get a little boys baseball gear.    They do consignment as well, so if you aren't in the market to buy something, you might be in the market to sell something!   Delivery of the machine was timely, the next day!

This is my new pizza hang out and take out joint.  I really like it.  It is a total neighborhood bar and pizza place.  I've had the salads, pizza and wings -- all were really good and at a good price.  I am looking forward to trying the sandwiches.  They look really good.  It's casual, easy going and the bar looks like it can get pretty neighborhoody fun.

Costco now sells really good Honey Baked Hams.  and if you have never had a REAL HONEY BAKED HAM as in FROM HONEYBAKED HAM Co. on Cactus Rd then you can't die just yet.  You must at least once in your life have one from here.  I only buy them around holidays like Christmas and I have to wait in a big ass long line just to pick the ham up.  You must  pre-order your ham in advance to guarantee you get one for Christmas!    So as I stand in the line, I tell myself that it would be so much better if I just decided to buy a ham in September sometime, or in July-- but I forget.  Not that waiting in the line is so bad, they have lots of free samples of food and there are usually nice people around you to make conversation with- ever so often an angry husband who must not have  know what he was getting himself into when he said "sure- I'll run and pick up the ham, honey".  So this ham..... it is this perfect crunchy outer sugary glaze that just makes my mouth water thinking about it.  You need to go to Honeybaked Ham. Like FOR REAL.

Hot-Diggity-Dog!  This place is hilarious!   It's horse betting and drinking and eating and gambling and drinking-- how could it not be a good time?   I don't even have the slightest clue how to bet on horses but let me tell ya, ask the ol' guy in the corner and he'll explain a TRIFECTA to you.   Get your drink on and throw your money away because you are heading to TURF PARADISE, Baby!

I enjoyed my meal here thoroughly.  The nigiri was awesome, I had the salmon and yellowtail-- both were HUGE and delicious!  The spicy tuna was quite tasty as well.  I will definitely come back if I am ever in the neighborhood again.  I went with a client and it was a good setting for talking.  We went for a late lunch and it was not packed and not empty either, just a perfect amount of diners in there.    The service was quick and efficient, friendly.  Enjoy your meal at Sakana's- not that you need me to tell you that, you simply will.

I do not think I will eat another Fatburger ever again.  I even used a Groupon (that's the star) and I could not stomach the food.  I'm not sure entirely what was going on here.  I've been to a Fatburger before and this very location in the past and it seems to be getting worse and worse each time.  The jumbo ketchup pump was empty, the soda station was a disaster, there was only one other guy in there, I think there should have been someone out tidying up.  The place looked like a mess- so that turned me off instantly.  The food was not good.  My burger was a giant sloppy mess thrown all together.  How  can a burger be done so wrong?  Why does this place looked like it just got looted?  Why is there a broom on the table next to me and why does my burger taste like a greasy mound of crap?

Why isn't there a 6th star for really amazing things like Thrifty Ice Cream?!  Have you had this before?  I have not been to this actual location-- there used to be Thrifty's all over town but now they are all gone and their ice cream is sold in Water Mart Stores.  Anyhow, back in the day, it was like 10 cents a scoop--- they have the most amazing scooper ever, it's like square shaped and perfect.  I would get the mint and chip and chocolate chip and when I would order I would stutter and get nervous that I would mess up saying: "Mint and Chip and Chocolate Chip".  The man (probably was a teenager but to me as a child, anyone over 12 was a man) would hand me the ice cream and I would hand him either 2 dimes or 1 dime and 2 nickles, or 4 nickels or.... well you get the point--- THIS STUFF WAS ONLY 20 CENTS BACK THEN.  Now it is about $1.09 a scoop and worth every red penny.  The best ice cream ever. EVER.

Wedding Ceremony and Reception  I wouldn't change a single thing about Orange Tree Golf Resort for our wedding ceremony location and reception.  JOYCE HARWOOD-- she is your gal, a fun loving gal from Long Island and she has you covered for all wedding needs.  She even does flowers too!  No fuss, beautiful and reasonably priced.   Here's the deal with weddings-- all things related to weddings, everyone tries to rip you off.  Not Orange Tree-- seriously, this was the best money I have ever spent.  And you can't ever say anything is affordable b/c weddings just aren't affordable, but they can be REASONABLE.  Orange Tree took good care of us and our guests.  I give everyone from the catering staff, the valet, the coordinators, the check-in desk-- the bartenders, everyone.... 5 stars!  Thanks for the memories!  PS. they have a kick ass bar too with a live band every Saturday night., well, you know as kick ass as a hotel lobby bar can be.... Lots of dancing!

Happy Hour 4pm-7pm is the PERFECT time to dine at RA for sushi. Should you decide to dine at RA.  3 gals with an alcoholic bev and enough rolls to roll us home and the total bill was $41 and change.  This was a nice bargain.  BUT.... the 2 stars state it perfectly "Meh. I've experienced better."  That pretty much says it all.  The sushi was okay.  Nothing special that makes me want to go back, so I probably won't unless I am shopping in Kierland and must eat a sushi roll but that probably won't happen.   Service was good.  It was that blah sushi. 2 stars.  With plenty of good sushi in town, they gotta step it up.  Do you think they do better sushi before or after happy hour like are they thinking "ha, it's happy hour and that cheap-skate wants good sushi?!  ha ha ha"-- I don't know.  But I'm sticking to my other sushi hot spots.

I always seem to forget that we can gamble here in Phoenix and that I get high from gambling.  Even when I get there, I am hesitant but the minute I sit down at a black jack table and start betting, I have such a blast.  Casino Arizona is  good time!  They don't give free drinks though and that sucks but the dealers at the black jack table are pretty nice and helpful for those shy to play but want to.    Good Times.  Good Times.  or as my friend kept muttering to me last night at the tables---  "You gotta live by the rules, even if you die by the rules"

www.arizonaministers.com   I want to give PHILLIP & GWEN WARING  (wedding ministers) 100 million more stars!  They were both amazing.  Phil Waring was our wedding minister, he came to our wedding at the Orange Tree Golf Resort-- he does most of his weddings on location, not really at his chapel.  Although, he can do them at his chapel, it's just pretty small.  But perfect for a 50 person wedding.  He truly made the ceremony absolutely beautiful and meaningful.  It was a non-denominational ceremony.  He can pretty much do whatever you want.  The price is very reasonable.   We worked with Gwen too just firming up details etc. and she was wonderful as well-- we really enjoyed working with them and I HIGHLY recommend Phil Waring to officiate your wedding!   I keep hearing back from everyone how awesome the ceremony was-- how often does that happen?  Usually, wedding ceremonies are kinda boring.... it's the reception that's fun.  But really, the best part of the wedding was the ceremony.  I could re-live that moment every day for the rest of my life.

Popped in a for a bagel breakfast sandwich-- had it on the "everything" bagel aka the BEST bagel type ever.  It was good, filling.  Back East Bagels is a simple little coffee/breakfast/lunch spot.  Nothing over the top, there is no need for it.  Looks like they have a variety of sandwiches etc.  They had this little "treat" on the counter that was 2 homemade sugar cookies with homemade cream cheese between the two cookies.  It sounded sooo good.  I didn't buy on but I wanted to, just to have a taste of it.   I behaved.  I'm not in this part of town very often, maybe once or twice a year.  But I am glad I stopped in for my bagel sandwich this morning!

I want to set up a bed in the corner here and just eat my way through all the different breads please.  First off, let me say-- they have the yummiest LOOKING foccacia bread for only $3-- available daily, I asked.  I am so going back next week and buying one.    We also sampled some Olive Oils-- they were all delicious!  $13/bottle but I think worth it with those tastes-- I want the Asiago Olive Oil.  Everything about this little market is just precious- adorable- and sweet.   I've purchased fresh rolls and loaves of bread from here and served them at dinner parties- they were perfect!

YUMMMMMMMMMM.  I frequent Calabria for my Italian Sandwich fix about once a month.  I get the Sicilian, which is a variety of Italian cold cuts in the the tastiest loaf of bread in town (sorry willow).  Maybe it's b/c it reminds me of the Italian Grocer (on a much smaller scale) that my Nonna used to take me to, but nonetheless-- this sandwich is DIVINE.  DeFalco's is good and has more of a larger Grocer selection but the bread at Calabria is much better tasting and the sandwich itself is more authentic tasting.  Prices run pretty high for a sandwich but it is huge and I suggest you just get oil and vinegar on it.  Worth every red cent. You gotta try it!

Easley's is so fun.  Halloween time at Easley's is a total mad house but still so fun.   If you ever have a themed party that you need to dress up for, decorate or just "get in the spirit" of whatever (National Pig Day)- this is the place.  They have hundreds- no wait-- THOUSANDS of costumes.  I bought my Afro wig here and all sorts of random stuff.  It's super fun and the prices are decent.  If you are ever bored and want to kill some time, just head to Easley's-- that store can entertain you without even trying.

It's unfortunate that some of my favorite stores are no longer in the Biltmore and it's remodel by Westcor makes it look like all the other strip malls in AZ.... what happened to the old Phoenix Charm?  Where did it go?  Rumor has it that Biltmore pushed Banana Republic out and Restoration Hardware.  I know Gucci left b/c the rent was raised so high, they said F YOU- we are heading to Scottsdale, leaving the expensive eye wear to be purchased as Saks.  I also heard that all the restaurants will be gone and condos will be going in there and up--- is this true????  Someone tell me!!!!  The most disappointing is the charm of the Biltmore is gone.  It's still pretty and nice to walk around but the charm is far gone.  It's unfortunate.    Although, my friends and I do think that there is an unwritten rule that only cute adorable children and precious doggies are allowed on the property and they must frolic and play on the grass.  So if you got an ugly kid, leave him in the car ala Britney Spears style.

ATTENTION BARGAIN EATERS!  What a great deal on a delicious fillling lunch!  For $8, I got an italian foot long sub, potato salad, small drink AND a humongous rice krispy treat.  I said it was a delicious filling lunch NOT a healthy one.  There are helathy options of course, I saw salads that looked wonderful and the menu is pretty extensive.  They even have a fresh fruit bowl.  The place gets jammed with the typical lunch crowd, but they are quick and efficient and move everyone along, even thought it crowded in that place.

Many of you would never know this place exists.... it is located in the basement of 1700 W. Washington.... The State Capitol.  Considering it is a cafeteria... it is really pretty great.  Each day has a menu of the hot foods and then there are the standards of salad bar, sandwiches and grill food like burgers, grilled cheese.  They even serve breakfast!  If you can get out of the office at 9:15am (only 45mins at work for me at this point)- I recommend the breakfast burrito.  They also have fountain sodas, yogurt, candy, snacks, string cheese, yogurt, gum.  It's  pretty darn great and convenient if you work by the capitol.

Mon-Fri lunch hours are filled with state employees, lobbyists, senators and representatives (during the legislative session).  This is the only times I go here b/c I work down here and it's a great place to grab lunch or to eat there.  You are not there for the ambiance.  Some construction has been going on for the past year or so to add on to this place but I really have no idea if and or when the new addition will be opened up.  Let me recommend a few things: 1. The Chicken Soup-- this is white meat, rice, chicken broth and pico, with fresh avocado. It is my favorite thing on the menu.  2. Tacos and Enchiladas-- you can't go wrong.  3. Do not order quacomole.  It is a green avocado-ish spread with cottage cheese.  Not sure why or what this is about.  4. Lock your car in the parking lot.  And then double check to make sure it is locked.    **This place is located nex to: http://www.yelp.com/biz/circle-k-stores-phoenix-137#hrid:yi7ZhqXV8hG2MwF8Tlr0gw

I chuckle to myself (and to my co-workers) when I wait in the Disney-like line at Original Hamburger Works.  We all frantically discuss what we want and if we can have a bit of their this or that---- I'll get this, you get that, then we'll share and then let's get fries, oh wait, maybe Onion rings- or both and then I want a large drink right? or is this the place with the massive drinks?  Maybe I'll get a smaller one-- oh, hell- I'll get a large one and a mushroom burger and fries and onion ring and I'll load up an entire extra plate of condiments and stuff my face with pickles until they call my name.    So this is what it is like at the Works for me--- can't you see why so much love?   The chicken strip are disappointing though, get a burger.   P.S. 4 out 6 times here-- there have been a group of firemen eating there too--- yummo.

When work is looking like a crap day, all I need is a sandwich from here, or a salad to put me back in a good mood.   The greek salad with chicken to be exact.  Subs sandwiches are served toasted on really good bread rolls.  The tuna is one of my favs.  There isn't a lot of seating but enough. It can get busy around lunch time so I always recommend going for a late lunch--- around 1/1:30pm.

Well, this is the real deal when you want a taco or tostada.  It's the EXACT food you will eat in Mexico.  Exact.  I ordered the asada.  Beef on a corn tortilla that is made there-- a real tortilla.    Then you go over to a salsa, quacamole, hot sauce, cucumber, cabbage and radish, onion bar and fix it up how you like.    The 5 stars is for the food, the ambiance and setting is not anything special.  In fact, it is a bit of a turn off , but very clean.  It's in an old Wendy's I think.   The food is so delicious, it doesn't matter!!!!!!

What a wonderful museum! Most people have never been or haven't been since their 5th grade class took them here on a field trip in the 80's.  Arizona is not as old as many other states but this is a reminder that we do have a lot of history in Arizona.    http://www.azleg.state.az.us/museum/museum.htm   Museum Description (from Capitol Museum Association) This National Register site served as both the Capitol of the Arizona Territory and the State Capitol and has been restored to its historic appearance. Exhibits: House and Senate Chambers, offices of Governor and Secretary of State, hands-on exhibit for sight impaired, and more. Gift shop.  OH... and it's FREE!  and you can go see the highly controversial 9/11 Memorial it's just a walk away from the museum.

I love me some Pino's.  If you are star struck by local newscasters, you can almost always find one or two in Pino's.  Some are pretty FOXy.   The spaghetti marinara is great!  But my fav is the pizza-- any kind.   Strange hours, but that's an Italian for you (I am 1/2 Italian, so I am allowed to say this)

Sacks is growing on me.  I think that I like my sandwich more when I do the "self portrait" and pick what I want on my sandwich.  They have plenty of choices, but I guess I can be picky with my sandwiches.  It gets busy here, lunch is best if you go a bit early or a bit later.  The phone is best for pick ups, it's super easy and super quick.  The best part is that you get a little cookie with your sandwich and they have multiple iced tea selections.  All of them are delicious!

Work hosted a bowling party here.  It was really great! This alley is huge-- like really really big!  The snackbar is like a diner and the bar is massive and has off-track betting.  The lanes are really nice too!  So clean and in good shape.  The staff was friendly and we ordered pizza for the gang.  Decent pizza, not anything out of this world but decent for sure.  There is also a good size video arcade area too-- Christown Lanes is a cool bowling location!

ohhhhhhh, I am craving The Golden Greek right now.  SO since I can't eat it, I will review it.  I have not been in some time but as far as I can remember it was one of the best Greek meals I have ever had.  The ambiance is hmmmm.... how do you say this? Dumpy?  But the food is just so fabulous that you forget you are sitting in a booth with duct tape holding it together.  The gyros are excellent.  Give it a try if you are in the area.  The price is affordable too.

Here's a dissss-gusting one for you.  Picture this.... 1993, Highschool, floating down the Salt River with a light buzz (who doesn't drink on the river?  Even 7 year olds are plastered) and my friend asks me what happend to my leg?  Why the bandaid?  I thought that was strange... nothing happened to my leg, I didn't have on a bandaid.  But I did.... it wasn't mine, it must have been in the water and it stuck to side of my leg with my ass firmly planted in the tube and my gams dangling in the water.  UGHHHHHH... I almost threw up, but instead I drank another warm keystone light and made it all better.   Never again.

WOW!  Joanna can make anything look good on anyone!  All is takes is the right tailoring.  For the first time in my entire 30 year old life, I had to have my bridesmaid's dress taken in (thanks, low carb!) and Joanna made this dress look great on me (well and the help of steak and salad for every fricken dinner for a month).    Totally affordable too- she is nice and very talented. Go see her!

AMF Frontier Lanes got an entire over-haul since the last time I was there (about 2 years ago).  I never understood why bowling alleys weren't modernized and de-stinked and FRONTIER LANES is the FIRST bowling alley that I have seen that has been remodeled.  It's clean.  The bathrooms weren't scary and it smelled absolutely fine in there.  We went to the Cosmic Bowl on Friday night.  It was a ton of fun.  10pm-1am- $18/person 3 hours of bowling and shoes.  The lights go down and the music goes up.... video screens and $18 pitchers--- good times.   The staff is nice too, which is a shocker to me b/c most of the time, in the past my experiences with bowling staff has been less than stellar.    On a side note, there wasn't any food, so make sure you eat prior to bowling if you do the 10pm- 1am thing.  The snack bar was closed.    Bowling is fun.

I attended a corporate dinner at Roaring Fork.  We were seated outside and the misters were on, I was sitting closer to the door inside and the misters were perfect for keeping it cool enough, but others on the outer skirts of the patio (closer to the actual misters) were sopping wet.  I guess it's better than sweating?  The dinner entree was a menu choice of 3 proteins: chicken fried steak, steamed fish or an 8oz. filet-- I had the filet, it was excellent and cooked perfectly to order (medium).  We had shrimp cocktail to start and that was sooo good!  Giant succulent shrimp with an amazing, salsa-ish cocktail sauce.  Really, it was just wonderful.  Ended the meal with a creme brulee that knocked my socks off, errr heels since I wasn't wearing socks to begin with.   Service was friendly, fast and helpful.  Roaring Fork was an excellent choice for this dinner party.    Oh, I can't forget to mention the cornbread-like biscuits in the bread basket, those were delicious.

I get my eyes checked about 1 time a year, sometimes once ever 2 years.  Lucky me has perfect vision.  I see Dr. Maury Kessler.  Nice man.   Wish I had more to say-- It is a really nice office space and the people working there seem really friendly.   Now I know my vision is going to be flawed for my next check up simply b/c I said I have perfect vision.

Come to Mama, pretty precious little drops of Heaven.  And I'm just talking about the packaging.  What's INSIDE the package is the real treat.  First off, do not eat your chocolate in the store.  Buy it and have them wrap it all up and put it in the bag.  Go home and sit down and eat your chocolate in at least 2 bite-- you hear me?!!  TWO BITES at least.  Savor the taste and feel your heart skip a beat.    ** Note: In the summer, go home right after the purchase and crank your a/c up on the floor board and place the Godiva bag down there-- do not let it get ruined by the heat.

I barely remember what I ate, but the atmosphere and the service was awesome!  It was a while back and I don't even know if htey still do this but they have salsa and dance lessons going on WHILE you eat, with the diners.  It was truly awesome and so much fun.   Of course, it's on a volunteer basis, it's not like your soup gets dropped off at your table and you are forced to salsa dance with you server while the soup gets cold.  I should head back and see what it is like these days.  I am surprised there are not more reviews.  It's by AZ 88.  PEPIN is fun and the food was decent and the service was great!

Food was mediocre.  Margs were decent.  Service was so-so.  Nothing really all that special to Yelp about.  Just another mediocre food experience.  Being surrounded by good friends made the night.  We sat on patio and sweated our asses off.  The misters didn't help but the margs did.  I wanted water but they never re-filled it so I came home really thirsty.  The food looked better than it tasted. I had the tacos and I wanted the shells to be better than the store bought ones but that is all they had.  My husband had the fish tacos-- it was more like a civeche in a soggy corn tortilla.    Just, you know, not the best you can get that is for sure.

This email serves as a public apology to all Grape Vine Karaoke Regulars:  I apologoze that a bussload of 30 somethings gals came rolling into your bar and caused all sorts of drunken havoc on your night.  It was my bachelorette party and I just really wanted to sing.  I sang, I think and I have pictures of us all singing, just no real memory of the singing.  Anyhow--- I THINK WE HAD A GREAT TIME!

Raw pizza sucks.  It sucks even more when the reason you ordered take out was so you don't have to turn the oven on and you end up getting raw pizza and now you have to turn the oven on anyway to get it cooked.  When we called to let them know that our pizza was raw, they were kind enough to reverse the charge on our card and apologize for the mishap that was very nice and the reason I didn't give only one star.    I would have have been happy, MORE THAN HAPPY to pay the price and have an actual cooked pizza because even free raw pizza pisses me off on a Sunday night when I am dreading to cook.   Raw in the terms of the crust still doughy and cheese not melted, even after placing it in the oven for a good 10/15 minutes, it was still doughy.  yuck.  I like NYPD a lot though and I need to just stick with the Camelback location, they have never done me wrong.

I need to get myself over to Dilly's Deli soon- I have not been in awhile.  I really liked the potato soup in the bread bowl--- wow!  SO good.  So am craving it now.    The lunch line would get really long though, if you can avoid the lunch rush, I would and go at an off-beat hour instead.  The bread is all really good here and the prices were good too.

okay, you don't go to Harold's for service and nicey nice.  You go to Harold's to get drunk and eat a hamburger.  At least that is what I have done every time I have been to Harold's.  And have had an enjoyable time when those were my expectations. I used to live in Cave Creek right after I graduated from college, for about 4 months.  I didn't really even know it was called Harold's b/c I referred to it as the Biker Bar Restaurant.

Authentic- Delicious Italian Food.  If you make it out to Cave Creek, this is the place to eat.  It's kinda tucked away so you have to plan to eat there to find it.  My father is an Italian Italian- you know from Italy and he really enjoys this restuarant.  As do I, but I am a bit Americanized.  The pasta is made perfectly al dente- how does he do it? I don't know.  I just eat it.

The minute you walk in, you feel the intimacy, smell the pecan wood, the spicy food.  Richardson's is an entire sensory overload.  Highly Recommend.  I had the Red, Blue and White Enchiladas and they were excellent.  My finace had the pork adovada and it was quite delicious as well.  Richardson's is great for a date, double date or family of 6 or less.

I have a love hate relationship with Last Chance.  I love finding a bargain, but I hate when I find clothes hanging in my closet with the Last Chance tag still on it.... it's easy to get caught up into the buying frenzy and then realize you just bought a bunch of crap you a) don't need, b) find a giant tear in the back of the sleeve, c) walk 1/2 block in the new shoes and a nail is being driven into your heel and blisters have taken over your big toe.  Regardless, finding designer goods for 1/10 of the price is quite exhilarating and I have found the most adorable hand bags, dresses and shoes that I love from Last Chance.  I'd rather less people know about it though b/c it gets crazy busy in this place.  For a good laugh, go early in the morning and watch everyone stand outside of the store as if Disneyland was about to open.

I don't really go out a ton in Old Town Scottsdale anymore, but when I do, I like going to Bungalow.  It's really chill, great patio, strong drinks.  I've never eaten any food, just drinking on the patio with friends on various different occasions and I like it.  Of course good company make all places great, but I've even had a good time when not with the best company here. Great people watching.

I enjoyed Cafe Boa Awatukee.  I came here with a client for lunch and it was a great atmosphere for conversation and food.  The servings are pretty large which I think is great b/c who doesn't like left overs?  (well some people don't but  I don't know you and I bet we wouldn't get along if  I did)  The atmosphere is really simple, airy and enjoyable.  It is in a strip mall with a Gold's gym so it might seem odd that such a great place is hidden in here but it is refreshing.   I had a fabulous caprese salad.

Eggsalent Breakfast! (yah, I know sounds dorky, but it really was excellent).  Coffee is presented to you like you are the only person in world having a cup of coffee, something nice about that.    NOTE:::  Since the last time I was in there, about a month or so ago-- it is now closed down and either has or is going to re-open as "Toast" but located next door?  I was confused when this was explained to me.  If you know, can you message me and let me know what is going on?  I suppose I could stop by and see for myself.

You know those mornings when you don't want to wake up? When you just want to lay there and rot?  Well, next time you feel that way and roll yourself out of bed, reward yourself with breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast!  YUMMMMMY.  It's all you need sometimes.   It's like homemade breakfast served to you in a cheery atmosphere, even a fresh little flower on your table.

If I could put zero stars I would.  Food is nice and all but service is most important.  I believe Lisa G herself is the woman who asked me and my boss and my boss's boss to leave our table and meet elsewhere so she could seat more people in the restaurant.  That's nice, thanks for nothing.  Anyhow, the bowl of balls were nothing to yelp about and I was quite disappointed that they carry the oddest soda flavors.  Don't ask what it is, your server thinks you are a whack job for not know knowing what the beverage selection is.  I'm a bit bitter, maybe b/c I suggested the restaurant to my bosses and then got treated like dirt.  It looks so cute from the outside (and really is in the inside), and since I live in the neighborhood, I like to try out the new restaurants and bars.  Anyhow, Lisa G and her staff can take the balls and shove it.

Just can't get into this place... there are some really nice reviews about Padre's.  I've been 3 times and all 3 times have left me just like "whatever"-- not really good, not terrible but more just nothing.   The service was odd, we were the ONLY ones in there one time (this may have been when they first opened) and nobody came to our table, I had to go get someone.  So that right off the bat left me unhappy but I tried it a couple more time after that and I still got the nothing feeling and the service was as I said before, odd.

If you want good coffee without the corporate coffee environment,  then Copper Star Coffee is for you.  Take a seat with some friends and relax on the couch, converse over coffee and the best homemade cupcakes that will ever grace your lips.  This place is top notch, the decor is artsy,  the owner is friendly and his employees are cool.  GO!  ENJOY!  Kick your feet up!  Check out the awesome bathrooms too. FREE WI-FI.

Went last night for Dining Out For Life with a group of gals pals.  We have a really nice time.  We all really enjoyed our food, I got the chicken street taco, they were tasty and exactly what I was in the mood for.  Our server, Rob, was super great too!  The only thing I didn't like about it was that my cocktail was $8.58 for one measly drink---- (that's with the dollar for tip.  Soooo..... $7.58 for a rum and diet with a lime just doesn't do it for me.  Also, the chips are the store bought kind-- not my thing.  But the salsas were delicious!

I'm giving 5 stars.  First off, there is no other non luxury department store anywhere even close to me unless I drive out to Scottsdale Fashion Square or PV Mall and when I am having a clothing meltdown (this happens more often than it needs to) the only place I can turn to is Biltomore Macy's.  Thank God, SOMETHING is there to help me find that emergency outfit.  I can always find something to buy here and they just had the most amazing shoe sale-- 50% off already sale marked shoes.  I spent $104 on 4 pairs of shoes.  One pair was originally $100.  I'm a Macy's fan, I'm glad they haven't been kicked out, errrr, I mean left the Biltmore.

Maggiano's is really good across the Nation, service is always spot on and the high quality of food is consistent.  My favorite fried calamari is from Maggiano's.  The specific location in Scottsdale is perfect for large parties and they are very accommodating and friendly.    We took mom there for Mother's Day for a buffet special for Mom's and it was fabulous!

Pretty cool restaurant.  They have sushi too which totally threw me off but whatevs.  We did have some sushi apps, they were good but not as good as some other places.  Our dinner entrees were really great though, we had 2 steaks, the salmon and the veal-- all of us were very happy with the food, and our server was super sweet and efficient.  The bread they bring to the table was Excellent-- probably one of the best bread rolls I've had in a long time.  I pulled a granny move and asked to take the leftover rolls home.  I want to make mini sandwiches with them tomorrow for lunch.  Why waste good food? Eh?

A fan for sure.  Everyone told me that it would be impossible to leave without buying anything but I proved them all wrong.  It's on the pricey side and the stuff is all really cute and fun but I had a hard time letting go of my purse strings.    The decor is adorable and it is fun to just wander around and look at everything.  They have a really fabulous wall of cards for all occasions that are funny and or kitschy.  A really great place to find a cool gift.  I'll have to head over again and see what must be purchased.

The Vig was great!  We ordered the following- Apps: Chips and Guac-- YUM, good chips Sweet Potato Fries-- good but not great Spinach Dip- v. good  Vig-azz burger-- it was big and it was good.   Pasta Special-- delish  Cheesecake-- excellent  The parking was a bit nightmarish but whatever, I am downtown a lot so I am used to it by now.  It's valet ($3) or you have to park across the street on the west side of the Checks Cashed joint.   Lots of cocktails-- everyone seemed to enjoy them all.  We were a group of 5 and the booth was perfect.  The setting was chill, just a really good experience.  I am looking forward to my next night out at The Vig!

traditional chines take out joint.  how can you really mess up americanized chinese food?  kinda greasy noodles and it tastes good actually-- but that could be my hung-over taste buds talking here.  nothing too special.  I mostly gave the 4 stars instead of 3 b/c they deliver pretty far-- I think within a 15 mile radius and they are cheap!!

This review is for bringing your stuff in for consignment and based off one purchase.  My family used to bring stuff here on a regular basis but not so much anymore, I need to get back into the habit.  But when we did bring clothes, accessories, house goods, etc it was was really great, easy and very organized.   I purchased my first real furniture sofa and love-seat set from here when I had my first real apartment after college.  It was a great set and so affordably priced!  I actually kinda miss that set, since then I have bought new stuff for my first real house.  I remember the staff being very friendly and helpful. Especially when you aren't sure how consignment works, they walk you thru it with ease.

Valle Luna was a good experience with family friends in town.  There was large group of us and they seated us in a private type room, it was fantastic!  Especially since we were visiting with family friends that we have not seen in a long time and we could hear each other.  There were kiddies too with us and they had a nice kid's menu.    The food was good, nothing out of this world, but good.  Service was like the food, good.    The parking was a pain though, not a very big lot for such a big crowded restaurant.

Our quest for the PERFECT coffee table has ended. Thanks to J & K Furniture, I found a super cool oval coffee table that I've been trying to find for at least 8 months now. The store is a large warehouse of furniture that might be new, might be floor model, might be a left over from overstock--- who knows and who cares because the prices are so right, it doesn't matter.   Make sure you wear comfortable shoes and expect to do some climbing around to maneuver around all the stuff.  The staff was very helpful and quick to help load items in your car too!

I am very hesitant to write my review here and post on Yelp.  Only b/c Yasu is so awesome I am afraid that there now will be a long line to get in.  By far, the best sushi in town yet.  Yasu is located in the Target strip mall on Cactus Rd.  It is almost hidden.  Unpretentious and delicious.  The Red Roll was my favorite as well as the Premium Spicy Tuna.  If my friends Carrie and Ben read this:  I had to YELP about it-- too many good restaurants close down b/c of not enough business and this one is too DELICIOUS to close.  I intend to keep it open myself if I need to.  2 thumbs up-- Go to Yasu!!

Yasu continues to deliver all these years... my very favorite place for sushi and sumibiyaki.  What you should not pass up at Yasu: Red Roll Premium Spicy Tuna Roll the Lamb Bacon wrapped Scallops  I am not big into lamb, but this lamb is amazing!  It is prepared over a charcoal fire called sumibiyaki.  You can also smell it burning in the parking lot and the smell alone is enough to drive you nuts.  I did not know what sumibiyaki was prior to visiting Yasu.  It is grilled food prepared over high end Japanese charcoal called binchotan. (Who knew?!)  There is a whole menu prepared this way and I think everyone needs to try it.    The Premium Spicy Tuna Roll is like no other I have ever had before.  I dream of the heat and texture that just melts in your mouth, making you wish there were more than 5 pieces.  The glory of sushi is you can always just order more and nobody thinks you are a piggy... it's expected.   Yasu is a nice quaint restaurant perfect for a date or gathering with good friends, seating is intimate and the staff is attentive and friendly.  I think I need to make eating here a weekly event.

Oh man, we came on a crappy day for this place.  The a/c was broken and it was was an oven in here.  I've never actually had a warm salad before today.  Warm iceburg lettuce with warm ranch is asking for a sick day.  It was so hot in there that the women's bathroom soap in the pump was even warm-- blech!  The pizza was really greasy, I had the pepperoni.  It was actually the most slices of pepperoni I have ever seen on a single slice of pizza.  And when all the pepperoni is on there, it leakes massive grease. And on thin crust, it's just too much.  My co-workers pizza was the ham and pineapple and she claims the ham was gritty--- what does that mean?  I dunno, but that is what she said.   I wanted to try this place out, it's right next to Marjerle's- I am still glad I tried it, just so I know.  I am still on the look out for good (non gourmet) pizza downtown.  Any other suggestions?

I'm digging this coffee bar.  I really like the name, the location and the look.  The coffee seemed a bit weaker than what I prefer but besides that, I enjoyed my first experience at Royal Coffee Bar.  (** I like really strong coffee, so I really can't hold this agains them)  I plan to go back.

***THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THE BUTCHER. ***  Conversation: Me: "What cut of meat is best for kabobs?" Butcher 1: eye roll "aaaaaa. what's out there?" Me: "well i heard a sirloin is good????" Butcher 1 : "Sure" Me: "can I pick one out and can you cut it up for me in kabob chunks?" Butcher 1 to Butcher 2: big eye roll "can we cut meat up?" Butcher 2: "uuuuuuu. yah. i guess. well. ummmm.  is there some out there cut up?" Butcher 1: " i mean, I guess we COULD but... uh, I just well, uhhh. cleaned.  uhhh........" Me: "Don't worry about it." see ya later a- holes. it's only 4pm, don't clean yet.  you may have to keep working.   I think they were too busy playing pocket ping pong to bother, they like working with meat, their own.  I'm usually not this bitter, it's just the whole customer service thing gets me every time.  In a bad mood?  too bad- fake it.

Hung out at the pool Cabana last weekend all day- it was a lovely 115 degrees and I had no idea.  I am sure my $97.00 bar bill had something to do with that.  Anyhow, it was quiet and relaxing and refreshing all at the same time (so I hear).

OH WOW!!! THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!  I was able to speak to the owners in my broken Italian-- it was awesome.   Then he had a SPECIAL gelato made for me... you ready for this?  Pepperoni Gelato--- ha!  He did it as a funny and it was really cute.  Anyhow, next time I am further up north, I am stopping by again!   DE-LISH!

If you have not visited Estate Treasures yet, YOU ARE MISSING OUT!  If you like the mid century modern thing, then you must get in your car and head over right now!!!  They are having a big blow out sale to get rid of stuff for a load of new stuff this week.    I purchased the cutest dining room table with chairs and hutch for under the cost of what we budgeted to just get the hutch.  Honestly, the affordability and quality of this furniture is amazing.  FYI- they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. Shop on!

I am reviewing this Arcadia Pita Jungle while anticipating the newest location opening downtown at 3rd and Roosevelt by Lola Coffee sometime very soon I hear.  But also b/c I just ate at PJ today for lunch and realized I have never yelped it, how odd.  I like it, I don't LOOOOVE it like some people do and that's okay--- considering, I have only had salads here it's hard to really fall in love with a place when all you've had are salads.  The wraps and other items on the menus look delish, I really need to branch out more.  Today's menu was the salmon salad, it was really good and really big, glad I ordered it b/c I was hungry.   My only complaint is that it took really long for the bill to get to our table which normally doesn't bother me but when you need to hurry back to work, it can be annoying.  The staff are friendly, I was thrown back by our server though b/c she was dressed like heading out to a brunch with her gal pals and was wearing a fedora so when she walked up to our table and asked what we wanted to drink,  I was hesitant to tell her b/c I thought she was just a nosy diner.  haha.  All in all, I'm a fan.   Seating is a bit tight, but not to worry if you go before noon.  The minute we sat down at 11:55, there was a line forming out the door for a table.

PLUG YOUR NOSE, IT STINKS LIKE SEWER AND A GAS LEAK.  Also, people, have your window down and your validated ticket in your hand ready to hand off to the parking attendant-- this will make things move along A LOT QUICKER.    Another important point, if you forget to have your ticket validated.... they MAKE you either pay or go back in and get it validated.  One time it was 5 mins before the parking attendant was off and he MADE ME wait for him to close up so the arm would be up or go back and have my ticket validated.  I was steaming!!  I sat and waited.  I can be cheap sometimes, but it was principle at this point.

I seem to forget about Lenny's for my lunch break.  I've only been here once and I really enjoyed my cheeseburger.  It's a tiny, BUSY burger joint/diner on Central Ave.  It's quick too-- they got me in and out and happily fed in good time.  I need to pick a day soon to head over there again!

I attended an event where Bruce Brown Catering did the food. It was really good! There was an excellent assortment of chilled and grilled fresh veggies, a simple and crisp Cesar salad with tons of croutons. Lasagna that looked good (I didn't have any). But one of my favorite parts of this catering set up was the biodegradable compost-able plastic wear, plates, cups, napkins.  I've seen them before and I commend catering companies that use them.  The set up was simple and attractive.  I also noticed on the business card I grabbed on my way out that they are located close to my home!  Coincidence? I think not!  :)

Discount Tire is built on a philosophy that many businesses should follow.  They are eager to help, their employees are kind, knowledgable and respectable.  They take care of you, the customer.  They aren't looking to make a buck, they are looking for loyal customers.  Need a hole patched on your, tire- NO cost.  Why?  Because when it's time for a new tire (which will be sometime in the near future), guess who you are going back to?  The place that helped you out previously.  Discount Tire, your place smells like rubber tires and gives me a headache, but I don't care... you take good care of your people and that is what matters most!

So after multiple opportunities to go to Fair Trade Cafe, I FINALLY went and loved it.  Why was I taking so long in going? Not sure. But regret it.  It was First Friday, so very busy and very chilly, so I went actually a few times in one night.  First run was with the veggie soup, that was fabulous-- I can't wait to try other flavors.  Second run was a plain coffee and it was  tasty, not bitter- I drink coffee daily and often find it bitter at a lot of places. Third run was a mint tea- can't ever go wrong with mint tea.    Now coffee houses, in my opinion are based a lot on the employees/owners, the vibe and the other customers.  The employees were above and beyond kind and the vibe was cool and as the night went on, it got even more cool.  It was open mic night and people were reading poetry-- some better than others but my favorite was a humorous poet who had the whole room in stitches.   I've never been to an open mic poet night, it was interesting.  I was talking to my friend and I got shooshed and someone yelled "MAN ON MIC!" and I felt like a frickin' moron but whatever, I understand.  I was new-- I didn't know the rules.  Doesn't help that when I talk in general, I pretty much scream-- loud talker but that's because I come from a family of 4 kids and if you were quiet, you were never heard.     So, Fair Trade is 5 stars in my book.

Metro Retro is very cool.  It runs a bit on the more expensive side but not too bad.  Darn it!  Why didn't our parents keep the 60's 70's stuff around??!!  It's back in and people are paying a decent amount for my old headboard growing up.  The store is non crammed, spacious and easy to maneuver in-- this makes shopping for furniture easier for sure.   I saw a couple pieces I liked but wouldn't work in our house.   I plan to come back again and again-- stuff turns over quickly and it's a different store after every few weeks.

Metro Retro moved from Central Ave to Hazelwood/7th Ave.  The store is different, not as cool as the old space but still has the cool stuff in it-- so it doesn't really matter!    It looks like some of the prices dropped as well, this is nice for me and probably for many others like me!  It's only open on Saturdays.  But you can call and request to go in and look for something it sounds like or to pick something up.    I plan to go often and see what moves through Metro Retro.

SOMAny places I would rather eat.  I understand this is supposed to be lighter healthier fare, but I was very disappointed by my salad.  VERY.  It was the salmon salad and the dressing was too vinegary and too off.  I won't be returning, so I won't be trying anything else just to see if maybe I ordered the wrong thing.

People are quick to tear apart a cellphone store, the bank, basically any place that provides service. Usually when you walk into a Verizon Wireless store, you are most likely dealing with a form of an issue.  So, by the time you walk into it, you're not happy to start out the entire exchange.   I walked in ready for help, a smile on my face and a look of "oh jeez, I hope you can help me" and guess what?! I was helped with complete and utter satisfaction. Lisa was ready to conquer the issue and fix it without me feeling dumb, penniless or confused. This is how service should be. But it's the customer's part in all this too. Ask for help and don't bark at the employees as if your phone calls, texts and facebooking are equivalent to you performing successful heart surgery.   I'm glad I met Lisa, she's the type to do what needs to be done and offer solutions. Thank you.  I'm very satisfied. Nice job!

I went here about a year ago and then went again about 5 months ago and both times my noodle (chicken low mein) tasted like dirt water.  I don't get it?  How do they get that specific dirt taste so perfectly? I gave 2 stars b/c my fiance's dish was good tasting but I don't remember what he had.  I just remember thinking, "this doesn't taste like dirt... so I must like it".  Anyhow, I suppose there is consistency.

This Fry's Rocks!  It used to be Smitty's when I was a kid so I have an instant love for it already simply b/c the location is nostalgic, but beyond fond memories-- this Fry's Rocks!  We bought a Patio Set- round table and 4 chairs AND a 3 burner BBQ with a sauce burner all for $289.00!!  Such a bargain!  Not only is this place a clean, well kept grocery store, they sell like real stuff, furniture, decorations, lamps, bedding, the works!  Anyhow, I had a great experience here with today's bargains.  Now we can have our own little backyard patio party.... who wants to grill?

Went on a perfect day to shop... Superbowl Sunday, after the game already started.  It was like my very own store!  I had heard this was the mother load of all grocery stores in Phoenix, so I spent 2 hours in there.  Just to get the feel and lay of the land.  LOVE IT!  Besides doing all my grocery shopping, I will point out the cool things about this SIGNATURE MARKETPLACE.  Covered parking with the option of valet and having your car washed while shop.  Pretty cool.  Great furniture selection.  Seriously.  Saw a desk and shelf set that I think I have to have.  There is a wine bar inside.  With stools, a TV and a bartender.  Smoothie Bar- yum!  Bakery is out of this world- attentive staff to help you make selection.  A large variety of bakery items and breads.  CARB HEAVEN!  There is a mini whole foods inside the store.  A mini bed bath and beyond as well.  And a mini best buy.  I love it.  I can't wait to go back.  The fruit and veggie section is gorgeous too!

I just got back from dinner at Nee House as we had a really good experience!   It is very very clean.  There were mostly Asians in here eating and that to me is a big plus.  BIG PLUS.  Our food was delicious.  We ordered the Moo Shu pork and the House Chow Fun.  How can you not enjoy something called "Chow Fun"?  Anyhow, the staff was very nice, quick and let me mention again how clean the dining room was.    We will be back for sure to try more items on their menu.

On the corner of Virgina and 7th Street.  I really like this place... you can run in and get your last minute items... say, ice, wine, flip flops, a knife, a calling card, britney spears cheetos, soda, fake grills (they go in your mouth), a pipe for your errrr. tobacco... you name it-- whatever is considered last minute for you.  The people that work here are so nice.  I would rather support a local place like Virginia Market than 7-11.  The parking lot is easy to get in and out of too.

If my house was a store, I would want it to be The French Bee.  Such great great house stuff and even some cool jewelry.  The prices fluctuate on everything.  I saw a necklace that I had to have and figured it must be too expensive so there is no way  I can buy it but it was reasonable!  So reasonable that I bought 2! -- Don't you wish we were friends?  When i find something great, I buy them in multiples to give one away.   The last time I was in there, it was around the holidays and they had the BEST CHRISTMAS STUFF!!!

I was craving this place so I was happy from the minute I parked the car.  I had the 2 tacos, rice and beans.  The rice and beans were fabulous, the tacos were so-so, but still filled my craving.  What I really wanted were chips and guacamole because I saw some other people eating them and they looked divine.  Anyhow, I plan to go back and try more items off the menu.  But for the most part, I was pretty happy.  1/27/08-- the chips deserve 5 stars ohhhh the chips!!!!!!!!   I had the cheese enchilada's last night, not good. 1 star

ASK FOR AL MANGER, he was awesome!  VERY very through, he leaves no stone unturned.  Al inspected a house for us that we ended up not getting and then we used him again just recently for our latest house in escrow.  He did yet another spectacular job and answered all my annoying questions.  He is thorough, good for a buyer, not for a seller.  Affordable.    602-738-6604 www.pillartopost.com

This may have been one of the most tranquil meals I have enjoyed.  We sat on the patio and I felt as if I was sitting in another world.  I felt as if I was removed from all the stresses of work and life and really sat and enjoyed my surroundings.  I don't remember what I ate, I believe it was a sandwich of some sort.  I left Arcadia Farms feeling all warm and fuzzy.

THIS IS A GOOD COSTCO.  I've been to quite a few of them and this location is primo!  Stocked really well, clean and nice employees.  The photo center has the best price in digital printing that I know of in town.  The items I need are always stocked and available.  Very much worth the $50 membership fee.

OH BOY this place is F-U-N!  Fun for someone who likes shopping for home stuff, and that someone is ME!  They have pretty good sales too.    One great item that I have not see any other place are the glass drinking jars that have lids so these glasses turn into great "tupperware" without the carcinogens being released when placed in the microwave.  They are great for single serve chili and soups.  The staff is usually very helpful and friendly at C & B too, willing to help you look for something specific and they sure do have specifics.  Especially in the kitchen wares department.   We registered here for our wedding and were very happy with our decision.  After your wedding, they send you a 10% off completion of your gift registry coupon.  This is great for all the gift cards you'll receive.  And apparently they send you another one on your year anniversary.  A good place to buy furniture after your Target/Ikea days are over.

Oh this place is fun if your doggie needs a haircut and or bath.  It's like a SALON FOR DOGS!  For real.... the groomers have the place set up like a real salon and they are chatting and cuting my dog's hair-- it's so flippin' cute!  Sophie, the Golden, loves this place and she likes Wag N Wash.  I have not been to Smelly Dog in awhile though b/c we've been going to Wag N Wash.  I hope Smelly Dog is still open now that I think about it.

We are constantly on the quest for pizza that is not from Papa Barfs, Domino's and Pizza Hut.  Why bother when there are some many better options throughout the valley.  We tried out Johnnie's recently and liked it a lot.  We had the peperoni Joannie style (this is the middle crust, not the thin and not the thickest).  It was pretty darn good.  The sauce is a bit sweeter than what I like but I still enjoyed it.  It was quick and it is convenient for our location.  The gal who answered the phone and took our order was really nice, she called me "Honey" and I liked that b/c I could tell she was older than me and that is the only time I like being called "honey" unless from my husband... or a gay man.

Sweeeeeeeeeeet Jesus.  This place is S-C-A-R-Y.  Once all the trash has passed over your feet and the 4th adult person with 4 teeth (total) has stopped bothering you, you are then propositioned by a sweet pretty little cracked out hooker to come meet some of her friends.   You enter the store.  Grab whatever you need (for me, it was diet coke), pay and RUN LIKE HELL to your car if it is still there.  I work by this particular Cirlce K, we call it the Cracked Out  K.    ** This review was based on a good day.  **

What the heck am I missing here?  The rice again was ooey and gooey again on my last visit, sticking to the roof of my mouth and having a waxy feel about it  .... I guess some people like it that way?   I was hoping that it was just a fluke the first time but now also the second time.  Other people's review I trust give it more stars.  I just don't get it.

I attended a reunion party at Firesky and had such a great time at the bar and patio area.  Something about Firesky makes me want to .... what are the words I am looking for.?.... MOVE IN!   The decor is so inviting and so cool, it really makes you wish that is what your house looked like.    The bartender was really nice and attentive.  The staff at Firesky are all so nice, I know it's a hotel and that is just the way they are supposed to be but this felt like genuine nice-ness.  Drinks are made well and the bartender is rally good about remembering what everyone was having, I love that trait--- makes people feel special.   I've never stayed at Firesky, but I would imagine it would be just a pleasant as my night at the bar.

This place is really cute and fun to walk around and look at all the cutesy stuff.  Now that I am an adult, I try not to purchase so much of the "cutesy" stuff- but I do still love it all!  Anyhow, the reason for only 2 stars is because the staff was so odd.  When I walked in, not a single person on staff said hello.  I found it pretty strange and uncomfortable.  It was my first time in the store.  So I walk around and consider purchasing some stationary but then realize the 18 different boxes of stationary I have at home will probably be enough for my entire lifetime so I decide against it.  Then I walk closer to the register where all the staff is hanging out, thinking maybe someone will say hi now?  NOPE-- WRONG.  I made eye contact with 2 different employees and smiled and not a single smirk back or an audible sound was made towards me-- only each other.    Sometimes it's nice to be left alone while shopping but not even hearing a "hello" is pretty bad.  I then leave and head over to Sur La Table and purchase some kitchen crap.  Does this mean I should use it now?  I go back in Swoozie's b/c I am killing time here to go to an event later on.  AGAIN, not a single hello, in fact nobody even looked up!  They must have been really busy?    Just an odd odd odd experience in such a cute store.  I won't be back, I can buy this same stuff at Write Ons and they will be nice to me and greet me.

ADORABLE PLACE!  Wraps, Pastas, Salads, Pizza, Gelato, Pastries, Sodas and Such   Super darling place that makes you feel so comfortable.  Looks like they have computers to use (i don't know if there is a charge). The inside is precious, decorated to the T-- not a single spot was missed.  Our food was placed on a silver tray and handed over to us to sit in a comfy booth and enjoy our wraps and pizza.  It was really good.  The place is just so darn adorable; it's hard to concentrate on the food when everything was so POSH while you NOSH.  Get it?

THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON DONATIONS:  We had boxes and boxes of household goods and pieces of furniture and bags of "stuff"- tons!  It filled 1/4 of the carport and I called White Dove and talked to the nicest young man who set up a pick up time to come gather all the goods, he told me that he was probably going to be the one picking it up too.  It felt soo good to get rid of it all it felt even better knowing that our donations were going to a thrift shop with proceeds going to Hospice of the Valley.  Thanks, White Dove!

Ummmmmmmmm.  YUMMMMMMMM.  Red Velvet. Lemon.  Come to Mama.  I didn't actually get to go to the store but Ben, the hub, did and he said it was best that I didn't face the chaos.  30 mins in line and the place was so small that he had to wait outside for a bit before even getting inside.  Picture a disneyland ride line.  He was supposed to only get 4 cupcakes but since he waited in line for so long, it was just plain SMART to get at least 8 cupcakes.  So a little less than $30 later, my MIL had a great time sampling all the flavors with us this fine Mother's Day evening.

Alex'is is the perfect place to bring a client.  They serve dinner and lunch.  The nice atmosphere is conducive for conversation and eating.  There is massive lightrail construction going on in fornt of the restaurant though so getting in and out is not as easy as it used to be, but in soon time it will be back to normal.  Anyhow, Alexi's is a nice place. It has it's old Phoenix charm.  The owner, Michael is also the owner of Christo's.  Today, I had the filet minon and veggies, it was delicious!  Gov. Janet Napolitano is a fan! I hear she frequents the restuarant.

Go at 11:30 for lunch- parking is a breeze and easy to get a seat.  But they won't seat you unless your entire party is there, even if all but 4 tables in the entire place are unoccupied.  There were more people waiting for the rest of their parties than actually sitting in the restaurant.  It annoyed me until half-way through my lunch I saw the entire place was packed and there were people waiting to be seated.  Smart move on their part.    My sandwich: Chicken & Proscuitto- deeelish! It was a big boy.  I had it with fries and ate it all, why oh why did I eat it all?  It's filling and large and I felt in charge after I snarfed it all down.  Our server was quick and friendly, she filled our teas even thought the carafe sat on our table- I loved this by the way.  I can't get enough iced tea these days.  I will be back and I can't wait.

I'm digging this place.  The outdoor space is beautiful.  I had The Bev-- eggs with tomatoes, spinach and tomatoes, it was great!  all the details of Palatte have been covered, the menu, the water on the table, even the cutesy table numbers.    It looks like what Anthropologie would do if they opened a restaurant.

I understand Palette went to table service and I was happy to hear that until I had table service.  I think I like the other way better.  It seems quicker and easier.  Our table service was awkward and slow.  They may need more practice-- that may be the case.   5 meals were ordered and 2 of them were wrong.  Not a good impression.  The worst may have been my pregnant friends breakfast who asked for her eggs to be cooked to thru and both times they brought them, they were not.   We went early and that was good because it got really busy around 11am.  We wanted to leave but it was taking a long time to get our check and our table wasn't cleared until we were getting up to leave.  That is kinda annoying, I notice this at some other valley restaurants-- they don't clear the table until you leave.  I would think it would make for better and quicker turnaround to clear as soon as people are done eating.  The table just gets cluttered and messy looking.   I will go back to Palette and try it out again and see if the table service improves and if not, then I guess I'll need to find a different breakfast joint.   I believe the owner did come around to tell us about First Fridays and he was very nice and friendly.  All the staff was friendly, I like that about Palette.

RING THE BELL!!  This place got out the world's LARGEST red wine stain on my IVORY Vera Wang bridesmaid dress.  It was an embaressing night to have to walk around looking like a stain all night but Bell saved the dress, not my dignity.  *** I am also taking my wedding gown here to get cleaned.  That is how much I trust this place.   Now I just have to remember where I put it.... hmmmm.

I literally just walked in the door from Carmella's.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It was quieter than I normally like--- we were the only other diners in there, myself, my fiance and another couple.  I ordered the Chop salad, it was delicious.  Everyone else had a pasta dish and they were very happy with it.  I will definitely come back again and they do deliver.  This is awesome since I just moved in at the end of the road!    I recommend this place.  The bread delivered to the table was divine and the staff was great too!

4.5 stars-- why aren't there half stars??!!  C4 was really good.  I had the bacon cheese burger and it was cooked to my exact request.  My dinner guests had the chorizo mac n cheese and that was really really good!  We had the appetizer of the chips and 3 dips, this was a bit lacking in taste.  I wanted to try the crab cakes, I should have.  Dessert was the lemon TART-- let me put an emphasis on the TART part, it was very very tart.  Not my thing, but it was my guests thing, they really liked it.  We also tried the bread pudding-- this was very tasty and we enjoyed it.  Our server, Shannon, was nice.  She had obviously tried the food and was able to talk about all the items on the menu.  This was nice to hear.    We went around 6:30 and it was quiet but by the time we were done, there were many other diners in the restaurant.  After our yummy dinner we went up to the rooftop to take a look, it is really really cool!  I am so looking forward to having some drinks up there very soon in the awesome weather we are having right now.  The pool area is beautiful, it looks like something out of a movie.    We had a chance to talk with Ben, he is personable, knowledgeable about he hotel, he was very open and honest-- we liked him.  Got a good vibe off him.  Planning on coming back and bring the friends with for some good food, drinks and atmosphere.

STUFF YOUR FACE WITH THESE THINGS!  Seriously.  I don't know what/how/why they can make these things so good but they do.  Maybe the stick of butter in each brownie?  I don't know.  I don't care. Just eat them and you will understand.  So many flavors to choose from, so many reasons to live.  FAIRYTALE BROWNIE-- you are my friend, my lover, the reason I am fat.  **The sprites are smaller and allow you to get a more variety of different flavors.

I have sucha great time when I go to Kobalt.  It must be something they put in the drinks or maybe it's the 9th drink or maybe it's the good company.  This gay bar is my kind of gay bar.  I sang karaoke here once and once only-- it seemed I was surrounded by "die hards"-- well I sang the Locomotion and I really thought I was Kylie Minogue but I was more like 8 year old Miley Cyrus singing my little heart out.  I think they faded the song about 1/2 way thru to get me to give up the mic.  My friend lured me away with a fresh drink.  This place is fun, easy going and the patio is big and welcoming.  I'll be back for sure!

Treated some clients to Sweet Pea Bakery items and they loved them!  I got the PB & J cookies , Mojito cookies and Rum macaroons.  Love that they are not the run of the mill flavors.  The shop is adorable, it's actually really big-- surprisingly big!  The employees are really nice and personable and that is always helpful and welcoming, especially when trying something/some place new.   They even gave me a precious thank you card to put with the cookies.     I will definitely be going back for more!

Appetizer: Hummus with Pita- ooh, the hummus was thin (not thick like a lot others around town) and so delicious! Perfectly tangy with the lemon and a perfect start for the meal!   Main Meal: Split the falafel and the beef schwarma. I liked the falafel better but both were good. The falafel was really really good. Full of flavor and the perfect texture and consistency.   The Nile Cafe is small (3, 4 tops and 2,  2 tops inside, a couple small tables outside on the front walkway). Great for a quick lunch to get in and get out. The staff was nice, seemed like a lot of employees for such a small place but it was kinda funny to see how many different people walked out from the back.   I am so glad I tried this place out-- I will be returning!

This food is legit.  We ate the Alambre de res, which is a flour quesadilla with chopped beef with bell peppers, onions and cheese and the Torta Nortena Torta,  grilled steak, onion, jalapenos, melted cheese, chipotle, tomato, avocado and mayo-chipotle dressing.  Both were fantastic.  The menu is extensive and there really is so much to try.  These 2 were fairly basic and clearly something a novice would order, but it was a good start and a great choices for a first timer.  I want to try the tacos and other tortas that have all sorts of amazing options like ham, chorizo, eggs, avocado and much more all in one torta.  Some of them were so high, I thought for sure the tops were going to fall off and the people eating them were going to bust the button on their pants- no doubt.

I thoroughly enjoyed my bruscetta flight and my wine--- I am not a wine drinker really but they had a nice selection and the server was very nice, I told what I do like and don't like about wine and she picked the perfect one out for me.  That is great b/c other times I tell people that I don't like dry wine and they bring me....... drum-roll..... a glass of over-priced dry wine.  The ambiance is fabulous, it's cool, chill, relaxed and perfect for conversation.  Now that the weather is cooler, I would like to sit on the patio and have a nice night out.   The mornings sound divine here but unforts, not able to make that kind of morning commitment-- too far of a drive but I'll be there soon to sit on that patio.  Hope you are too!

I finally got to sit on the patio and enjoy the chilly weather.  It was wonderful.  The service again was great and the food was tasty.  My only problem was the wind blowing kinda hard and little leafy things from the trees above flutter down all over the food and in the drink glasses.  It didn't stop me from eating or drinking but it was just kinda annoying.  Not enough to keep me away though.  Bombero's has an uber chill atmosphere that I really enjoy and the food is really good.  I even got to order a "to-go" coffee and it was a nice cup of Joe- just what I needed after a chilly evening on the patio.  Heaters and fire pit were going so not so bad.  Just a great night over all!

Just had lunch here last week.  I was happy with it.  I had the brisket.  It was tasty and exactly was I was expecting and craving.  The beans were more like a chili and completely the yummiest form of comfort food.   The owners and employees are so nice, it's wonderful to see places like this with good people owning it.  I left think, "what fine, lovely people"-- I plan to head back out and try more things on the menu.  oh, the cobbler was very very very good.  Did I say very enough?

Thanks to Gracie B in SF, I was able to attend Insight Bowl this year.  Not that I am a crazy football fan-- I really know NOTHING about football, but the entire vibe at a bowl game is really cool.  From the National Anthem that always brings tears to my Canadian eyes to the jets flying overhead to the $5 bottle of Dasani water (the small one) to the band playing fight songs to even the actual game-- IT WAS FUN and I am really happy I went!  I love that AZ hosts these kinds of events, it brings in great revenue to the cities and just plain fun and camaraderie for everyone.  Indiana lost, we were rooting for them but we were defeated.  We still had a blast-- but I think the most fun of it all was watching the band leader work his magic.

I am a total fan of PV Mall-- something about it.  Maybe it's the nostalgic feeling I get from being in 8th grade and going to the movie with my friends and walking around the mall acting cool.  Years later (many)- I still walk around feeling cool but not because I bought a belt at Units (it's a skirt, it's a belt, it's a shirt- you remember that one?) or got a new skirt from Wet Seal-- I feel cool because I just scored the best deal at Macy's on work pants and can't wait to wear them the next day.  There are malls with better shopping options but PV Mall does have some decent stores still:  Macy's, Bath & Body Works, Body Shop, Gap, Ann Taylor, JC Penny (um btw, JCP has some really great stuff in there, you just gotta look), Hallmark.  There are more but I am tired from thinking of them all. OH and Costco is new to it!  It's not really all that busy here, so that is more my speed when I just want to wander in and out of stores that I may or may not buy something from on a Sunday.  I'm a fan of PV Mall.

THIS PLACE ROX!  First off, they sell Bumble and Bumble products-- this is a major plus b/c not many salons sell B & B.  All the stylists there are so nice and know the product and can help you find exactly what you are looking for.  I got my hair cut by Alissa, she was wonderful!  I highly recommend her.  This fun and NON PRETENTIOUS hair salon was exactly what I have been looking for.    A cut runs $50 but they have $25 off coupons for first timers. If you would like one, let me know, I will happily give you one!  I am having Alissa do my hair for my upcoming wedding so I will YELP that once it is said and done.  **** EDIT: Scissors Rox Paper-- Alyssa and Lauren made me LOOK GREAT-- hair and makeup!  whoooo hoooo!

Congratulations to all you fit people or wanna be fit people-- I congratulate you on running, walking, skipping whatever it is that you do to finish a marathon or a 1/2 marathon.  I actually had to drive to work this Sunday to get something off my desk I forgot and nearly lost my shiz when I saw all the roads blocked off but actually it wasn't bad I found my way to my office just fine.  It was actually pretty cool to see all those people out and about huffing away.  I honked as I drove by the underpass -- pretending to look around with that look on my face of "who is honking??"  -- hoping I motivated someone anyone.    SO this review is more a SHOUT OUT to those that participated.  WAY TO GO!!

We did take out from Humble Pie.  Ordered 1 pepperoni and 1 Ham and Olives (more like straight up Bacon, yum) and the iceberg wedge salad.  When the order was called in, they said "ready in 15!" and it was-- that was quicker than any other pizza place I know of.  It was awesome pizza and that iceberg salad was excellent! I am looking forward to going back.  This was takeout, so I would like to try to actually dine there.  I've received a couple cool coupons from Humble Pie in those Val-Pac coupon envelopes, I know most people toss them out, but I actually look thru them and I've received a free pizza coupon with $20 of in dining purchase-- need to use that!

So, I've only been to this Tempe San Felipe once and it was for a networking event.... all I met were really drunk people. Not sure if that is the networking groups fault or San Felipe's so I'll make this review not reflect that part.   My most fond memories of San Felipe are my fun college years at Northern AZ University, so once I walked into this Tempe location, I was disappointed--- it looked like a mega-mall bar, not like the San Felipe I remember.   The crowd was interesting, it had a mix of all ages-- young and old were out this night. Service was slow, but nice. It wasn't too busy but busy enough, it was just a little after 5pm, so the "happy"-ness was just getting started.   I might go again to this place, just see what the vibe is and when I am not there for a networking event. If I was in the neighborhood, but that doesn't happen that often so we'll see!

My fiance called it: "the place you go to take your kids with runny noses and beat them in public"   It was a really strange experience when I went here.... like I was in a twilight world. It was my first time in 5 years.  I watched a child with snot running down his nose and into his mouth wipe his face on a long sleeve in the clothing department.  NOW THAT IS MESSED UP!!!

Working downtown leads me to many hits and misses for lunch.  Thai Elephant was a definitie HIT.  The place is small and cramped but the food service is quick and tasty.  When you have limited time that is really all I ask for.   All meals are served with a small cup of soup, crispy egg roll and a cup of rice.... you basically pick some sort of vegitable (they ask how spicy you would like it) and add either: chicken, beef, tofu, shrimp or seafood. Meals range between $7-$9.  I am looking forward to going back again!

I've had better than Genghis Grill.  Why is mongolian BBQ difficult to find these days?  I can't find one in my neighborhood and someone told me to try Genghis Grill out. Since I was going to be in Tempe, I figured WHY NOT?!  Genghis Grill is  not my thing.   We got seated and handed a small metal bowl, I was confused.  At the other mongolian places I have been, you start out with a big bowl not this dinky bowl.  So, I say "whatever, fatty" in my head and head over to the start line to get this meal going.  What do I see?  Nothing but the sickest thing I have seen in a long time.  A BIG-ASS BOWL of BLOODY MEAT, just sitting there in a bowl of blood.  I've never wanted to be a vegetarian so badly in my life.  I suppose I was used to YC's where the meat is frozen and shaved.   I don't like actually seeing the blood of a meat product, it really grosses me out.    Anyhow, the bowl didn't fit nearly as much food as other places, I guess it's good I didn't over -stuff myself but the price was higher and that whole  meat product area was really bad.  Oh and the scallops, I think they were scallops?  Anyhow it was like a bowl of white fluff (you know marshmallow fluff? in a far?) No real shape to them.    So this whole "fresh" meat, chicken area is one of the grossest things I have seen in a long time.   I must say that after it was all cooked and brought to the table it was more than enough food and it tasted okay, not what I was expecting.

The PV Mall  Macy's has grown on me more and more... I've come to appreciate it much more than at the time of my last review. The staff is really friendly and helpful and I've been able to find what I am looking for and IT'S ALWAYS ON SALE!  I love this.

How does In N Out do it?  The consistency is amazing.  The service is impeccable.  Do these happy boppy teens really love their jobs?  Does upper management   inject them with happiness cola on their breaks?  I don't get it.  But this is what I like best about In N Out, the service!  The delish burger sure makes it a great trip too.  Going to In N Out is a "trip", it's always busy, so it's not like a quickie run for a burger and fry.    The Fries-- not sure that I like them, I always order them simply b/c everything is so cheap- but I also always eat them.  I think I just like watching the happy staff cut them up.

BRILLIANT IDEA.  Everyone knows kids grow out of clothes, toys, shoes, attitudes, etc so quickly.  Most items are gently used especially when they are very young.  I went to Hissyfits with my friend who is a die hard fan and wow!  she got some serious deals.  The place is packed, it is separated by boys/ girls and then by size.  There is even a section for toys, maternity wear, strollers (which I hear go quickly), baby needs like bedding, crib mattresses, high chairs, baby carriers- all sorts of goodies!  The prices are a steal and hard to pass up.  Yes, the place is jam packed but that's even better- more selection!    Friend them on facebook and you will hear about all the specials they have and items coming and going.

I have not done a real "shop" in here yet, but from what I experienced on my very first visit I liked.  I came for flowers and WOW! They were gorgeous and so affordable.  Can I say gorgeous again?  They were wrapped in fake looking newspaper that was even cuter.  I will return for flowers without a doubt.  Then I picked up the soy crisps, I heard good things about these soy crisps (f&e brand)-- they were really good.  I will buy more of them as well.  I plan to go on a real "shop" sometime soon and use my $5 off coupon they mailed to my house.  Who knows.... I could add a star, take away a star, or stay the same.  We'll seeeeeeeeeeeee.

pizza pizza!  I have never dined here, but have picked up pizza numerous times.  I like it a lot.  It's better than most other pizza and it's really close to my house.  Belfiore has a restaurant on one side and a deli/bakery on the other,  the cannolis are really good too.  I have not tried the other treats but I plan to sometime soon ( as soon as I forget my new years resolution).

We went to La Bocca with a group of 15 and it was great!  I can see how people are comparing it to Postino.  The concept is the same for sure.  Bruschettas, Salads, Pizza-- you know, that type of food.   Our servers were very kind, attentive and handled our party really well.  We ordered prior to arriving and that was a good idea.  It's lighter fare, perfect for light bites and drinkies!  And when the bill comes, it comes in this cute little bill folder, not those long skinny ones but a cute little square.  I took a picture of it, I will post it.

Went to a party where they had Stacy's cater it. So good-- it was the BBQ beef, BBQ pork and BBQ chicken.  All of them were fantastic but I enjoyed the pork best, which is odd b/c I am not typically a fan of pork.  Anyhow, it was all perfectly moist, well seasoned and was a big hit at the party.    I would order from them for catering and I need to stop into the actual restaurant sometime to try the other items on the menu.

So I was doing the no carb thing for awhile and my very first carb loaded meal was at Chik-Fil-A.  One would think that after not eating carbs for a couple months, anything would taste divine---- WRONG.  Chi-Fil-A used to be in malls when I was younger and they would hand out free samples of the yummy fried deliciousness on little toothpicks when you walked by.  This then would make me turn to my mother and beg, plead, cry to eat at Chik-Fil-A.  It was really good then.  This was my memory when I went to the Tatum location.  What I got was a super fried chicken fillet that needed salt-- gasp!  Who actually adds salt to fried chicken?  Well, this one tasted bland., so I HAD to.  My bun was soggy and my fries were cold.  Is this really the carbs I was craving all this time? No.  I should have gone to have sushi.  the 2 stars are because I WANT it to be more that 1 star.   I give it another go ahead, a few weeks later-- at this point I have eaten so many carbs my pant buttons are popping off and AGAIN!  cold fries and soggy bun.  WTF??!!  I haven't been back since and since I am on a NEW diet, I won't be heading there anytime soon.  Boooooooo.

Guacamole was the the highlight of this meal.  The good friends dining with me too but that was pretty much it.  The a/c was not working correctly so it was unpleasant inside, my group considered going to a different restaurant in Tempe Market Place but stayed since none of us had eaten there before and when the appetizer (guac) arrived we thought we felt some cool air, but it only last for the next 20 minutes.   I had the pork tacos.  For $16 it was a skilled of pork that was dry.  It had a nice seasoning but when the server placed the skillet in front of me, it looked as if it was sitting in the back ready for the past 30 minutes before it actually came to me.  It came with a little bit of beans, a lime wedge and 4 tortillas.    My counterparts meals were okay, they didn't say really if it they liked it or not.  The strange part came towards the end of our meal, our waters were not re-filled, nor was my iced tea.  That bugs me especially when it was stifling hot in there.   I am pretty sure the server was trying to leave b/c she kept grabbing for the bill, but we had not paid it yet.... I realized she wanted to leave but it was 10pm, hardly that late.

Ahhhhh, this place is so cute and so YUMMY!  I want to go back ASAP and try more food.  I had the kidney bean sald-- it rocked! and the proscuitto sandwich was awesome.  The prepared food case made my eyes tear up with joy, everything looked so good and fresh.  I am in love.

I am so angry with you, Chompie's!!!  My sister and I were craving a Chompie's bagel so we swing by the PV Mall location to pick some up.  We were in there for over 20 minutes and exited WITHOUT A BAGEL and without our number being called.  We pulled #29 and it was on #26 the entire time we were in there... And when we would try to ask what was going on, we were SHUNNED!  SHUNNED?  I was trying to ask if we need to stand somewhere specific, ask why people coming in after us were already home eating their bagels.  But I couldn't even get that far.  This Goldstein is going somewhere else from now on.  Well, maybe.... Chompie's Bagels are so good, at least they used to be, I wouldn't know because I never got one!

I have had multiple great experiences at Spencer's.  We have purchased all our home appliances at Spencer's.  They are a locally owned store and have impressively low prices and high quality products.  The thing that makes us keep coming back to Spencer's is the staff.  They are HELPFUL and make sure you get what you need and in your budget.    When I make large ticket purchases, I need some hand-holding especially if it's an appliance.  The staff answers questions, makes me feel comfortable and provides information that will help you make a purchase with some knowledge of what you are buying.    I tried going to a big box store for a great deal but Spencer's was cheaper and I was able to ask questions to someone who had answers... I will keep coming back for appliances.

I was not expecting much from Salty Senorita but I was impressed when we got there.  I felt like we parked really far away and came upon  the lot of a "Mexico" film set.  It was more busy than usual because of the Cinco de Mayo drinking starting up.  Our drinks were good.  -- well every one was drinking beer but me so how can you mess up  a bottle of beer?    The food was surprisingly good for being such a party atmosphere.  The chips are good chips-- like the real kinda greasy kind.  Not overly greasy, just a nice amount and they were salted with kosher salt--- fabulous!  I had the pork street tacos and they were delicious.  It came with 3 of them and a side of mexican rice that was more like dirty rice-- still good.  and a side of pinto beans with a light sprinkling of cheese.    Good food, good atmosphere, good service.  I wasn't expecting so much from Salty Senorita- shame on me!

Z Tejas is solid.  It consistently delivers good food and good service.  I enjoying lunching with clients here and I enjoy coming by later on for cocktails or chambord margs and appetizers.  I chose Z Tejas for my bridesmaid luncheon as well in January -- I agree with Gabi, they are 'group friendly'.

What a cute little place! Maizie's is really adorable! I can't wait for the heat to go away and sit on the patio, it's a bit tight in Maizie's. First we got seated at a table that you literally bump into when you walk in-- I suggest just getting rid of that table. But they moved to a high top for 6. there was another lunch duo on the other side but I don't mind this kind of dining-- kinda fun!   So I had the salmon salad even though I saw beautiful sandwiches and fries coming out of the kitchen. The salad was fresh, delicious and really big~ so happy I went this route. My lunch buddy had a turkey wrap and she really enjoyed it as well.   The server was nice, staff was attentive and personable. I did this place! The happy hour looks really great too an I have heard great things about it so I am hoping to hit a HH up there sometime.   Let me end this on how my lunch ended at Maizie's too--- as we were paying the bill, the most wonderful smell came over me and I look around to see where it is coming from and of course it's the kitchen and a server walks by with the BEST smelling cookie with ice cream over it I have ever seen/smelled. I wanted it so bad but I behaved, maybe next time.

I really really enjoyed Eddie's House.  It was cool, relaxed and high end all at the same time.  We were late for our reservation and it wasn't a problem (thank goodness).  The staff is spot on and friendly.  The chairs-- oh the chairs are so comfortable and you start off with fresh bread and butter with a pesto dipping sauce.  mmmmmmmm.  The entrees were delicious as well.  I had the steak salad and it was divine.  Other diners in our party had, the Cobb Salad, the lettuce wedge with bacon and dressing and the burger with waffle fries.  Eddie himself came out to help my friend cut her burger.  He cut it in fours for her and he said that's how he cuts it for his kids.  It was cute.  We didn't have dessert but we drank so to me, that is dessert and appetizer and main course sometimes.   Our server was really friendly and happy to answer any of our questions.    I am looking forward to our next night out at Eddie's House!

We ordered a METRO pizza (just pepperoni and cheese) for pick up.  HILARIOUSLY huge box.  It took up the entire back-seat length of my Honda CRV.    The pizza was delicious.  I think everything has been said about Pizza A Metro already but it really is some good pizza.  I need to go back and try the pasta now.  It is really small and warm, so I will need to go in the winter when it's cooler.  But I am sure it is worth the heat.  I wanted to save the pizza box and use it to store wrapping paper in it but my husband wouldn't let me.  booo.  It went to the recycle bin.

This Target is SUPER in all ways: Super b/c it's what Target calls "Super" = has the grocery store inside   Super b/c the parking lot had actual spots to park in that weren't in BFE on a Saturday  Super b/c the check-out was quick and painless  Super b/c they had a bunch more clothes than the other non-super Targets carry  Super b/c it is clean and pretty new-like still

The first time I walked into Practical Art was around Christmas 2008, I was in a shopping mood and had great fun in picking out unique gifts for some friends and family.  There are so many choices of ceramics and pottery that were absolutely beautiful!  It was difficult to not buy everything in the store!  Especially when the nice shop gal was so helpful and told me everything was made by locals.  I've returned a few times since then to either just look or grab another perfect gift.    If anything, you should go in just to take a peek and who knows.... you will probably come home with a little something for yourself or find the perfect gift!

Olive Annie is beyond cute!   I found it on accident.  7th street was all blocked up and I was living back in that neighborhood at the time.   I cut through on Sheridan and I saw Olive Annie.  In my frustration with traffic, I had to just park and go in since shopping seems to calm my nerves.   They weren't open but I saw 2 ladies in there.  They saw me at the door and let me in anyway b/c they had just opened the shop the week prior and def. weren't going to turn a customer away (this is what I am guessing).    They were so nice and chatted with me a bit about the store.  They had some really great stuff in there, clothes by Free People and just some great shabby chic items for fun, decor and whimsy.  I love shops like this!   I need to go back.

I have not been to many Indian restaurants but I am very happy I tried The Dhaba!  They have coupons on restaurant.com btw, be sure to log in and buy one, it's a great deal!   The table was set beautifully with traditional plates and glasses, I really liked that.  It takes a while for the food to come out so be sure to order appetizers and place your meal order at the same time.  The menu can be a bit shocking to take it all in at once, I did my homework and viewed it online before we went so I could figure out what I wanted.  The naan was so delicious, go for the garlic naan.

Perfect date night restaurant. Order as many different items as you possibly can, everything is so fantastic that you really need to try everything!! The menu changes nightly so I only find it appropriate to go often.    NOCA has become my most favorite dining experience in the valley to date.  The food, the setting, the service-- all of it is an experience that I keep telling my friends they "have to go, you are missing out!"  I even offered to babysit for the friends with kids, I am pimping noca out.    The Berkshire pork belly confit was no longer just something I heard talked about on Top Chef, but my appetizer at noca. Everyone I know MUST try the Hot Buttered Lobster Roll as well.  The Buratta (Italian cured meats and very special homemade mozzarella) was a dream come true.  These were just the appetizers, people.  Pastas:  The Rigatoni was good but the Conchiglie, little pasta shells with pesto and pine nuts was so rich and beautiful, I felt guilty for eating it, like it was sinful or illegal.     Proteins: The table loved the Berkshire pork tenderloin, but I personally had a love affair with the Wild Stripe Bass, mostly b/c I wasn't expecting it to be so amazing, it caught me off guard.  The Prime Skirt Steak was equally as lovely.  We even ate dessert, seriously.  The donuts made me smile, the salted caramel ice cream sandwich was not really my thing but of course still good.  The dessert that you MUST try is the chocolate pudding cake with the banana ice cream- I don't know how that cake was made but it was made for me and I am okay with sharing it with you.

I just finished my muffeleta sandwich from Dlicious Dishes and am trying to figure out a way to get back there as soon as possible to try more of the items! Workies and I ordered sandwiches to bring back from the office. They were D'LICIOUS! While there I also purchased some white truffle oil and 2 large wooden spoons. The place is filled with prepared foods that look amazing and priced well. There are also pastas and sauces and breads and all sorts of gourmet condiments. You need to check it out-- you can eat there or take it home. Either way, your tummy will be happy!

This location has become my #1 favorite location in Phoenix.  I used to go to the one at Town & Country because it used to be closer to where I live, but it was always so congested in there--- like crazy busy that it seemed to ruin the experience.    This location at Tatum/Shea is much more roomier and not nearly as "mad-house"- ish.  The employees are so nice (well, most TJ employees are fabulous!) and helpful.  They will always go look something up for you or help you find what you need.    Around the holidays, they all have some of THE BEST holiday treats ever--- ranging from cookies, teas, chocolates, etc.  I can't even function in December without the Gingerbread Coffee or Winter BLend coffee.  The prices are unbelievable affordable and the packing of their products are so cute.    I really can't say enough great things about Trader Joes, if you have never been to one, I suggest you get moving to your closest location asap.

Chanel was the only reason I put my drink down for longer than 14 minutes.  Needed to take a looksie to see what I must have.... pretty much the entire store.   I love the Bellagio, I love Vegas and I love Chanel.    Staff was really friendly.

Quaint. Comfortable. Homey.   When I first walked in and looked at the Reading Room, Tuck Shop reminded me of being in someone else's home in 1960.  I loved it!  There was a group of 5 of us, they only take reservations for 6 or more so we went earlier than later to ensure a spot.  5:30-- PERFECT.  After work and ready to try some supper.      The server made it sound as if the larger plates were so huge and they weren't really that big.  Between 5 of us we ordered: Panko crusted Walnut Fontina Cheese Dates stuffed with Sausage Times Mac n cheese (minus lobstah) Fish n CHips (special) Fried Chicken and Waffles (with the worst tasting greens in the world) Coriander Pork Loin  Not too shabby-- we each ordered either a cocktail or a Coca Cola Light (from Mexico-- love the bottles and that it's called Light, not Diet)- came out to $27/person plus tip.  That is good!  My only complaint, was that there was 5 of us and we asked if we could order one more sausage stuffed date (that doesn't sound right), so we could each have one and the server told us "the chef doesn't do that."  That's okay, one gal didn't want one anyway.   Tuck Shop's food is homey-- I like it.    The bar isn't fully stocked but, they have the basics.  I feel like I was there for the food anyway.

When we walked in I heard "Sweet Emotion" mixed with some cool tracks, I knew I was going to like this place.  Saturday night after a Phoenix Art Museum reception and the place was pretty crowded with the artists and friends.  I thought it was a cool vibe and very relaxing in SideBar except that it was really loud, but I didn't mind since I wasn't in the mood for talking (shocker).  I didn't order any drinks but everyone else did and they seemed happy with them-- it looked a like a bunch of draft beers and mixed concotions-- yummmm.  It's really comfy in SideBar, plenty of seating that moves around so smaller and larger groups can be accommodated.    I didn't smell Pei Wei but wish I smelled Pei Wei, that is a heavenly smell.   This was my first time and I plant to hit up some happy hours for sure!

VOODOO Chicken was fantastic!  Most of the entree selections were available over rice or pasta.  They had many gluten free options and they use brown rice and brown pasta. I stumbled upon Jaspers Peak Bistro on accident and I am glad I did.  Cajun inspired food cooked well.  Very satisfying and delicious.  The server was a bit neglectful, but we were loving our food so much and the company of friends that we didn't mind so much.  The neglectful server did recommend the food we ordered and we were very happy with it.

After reading about PastaBAR on yelp- I had to go see for myself what the heck is going on here!  Walked in--- liked the seating situation and the ambiance.  Had the nicest server ever, his name was Nick.  He talked about the menu and answered our questions.  Brought some really great tea and tangy lemonade.    We ordered the fried mozzarella, they make the cheese there-- it was so good.  But not as good as my entree!  I ordered pappardelle and it was possibly the best pasta I have had at a restaurant ever.  It tasted just like my Nonna's homemade pasta, the perfect texture, cooked the real Italian al dente way and I was in heaven.  It was the special and it sure was special.  The portions were good too.  After reading everyone's reviews about portions, I was scared I was going to have to pick a sandwich up afterwards, but no-sir-ee.  I was happily full and planning my next trip!!!

I finally went to scramble, it was quite the scramble this morning for the staff since they were down a grill.  I had to explain to people in the line that he gal said "down a grill" not "a girl" as they were saying, can't they call a back up girl in??  HAHA- kinda funny.  Anyhow, down a grill must have sucked for them and for all of us in line that went out the door, but it did move quickly, the line moved quicker than the food arrived, but they did tell us while we waited in line, that it would be at least 25 minutes for food.  I was with a good friend who I wanted to catch up with so we didn't care and it didn't seems like it made anyone get out of line and leave either.   We ordered, it's basically everything any breakfast place would have.  They have the drink station in the middle, get you liquids and condiments yourself.  I'm cool with that, I kinda liked it b/c I would rather just grab what I want rather than have to keep asking.  Ketchup, hot sauce, more napkins, drink refills whatever- do get it yourself is fine with me.   My friend had the meat lovers omelet, she was into it.  It was a lot of food.  I had the gringo burrito and a cinnamon roll.  I was a bit disappointed with the cinnamon roll. since the reviews made it sound like it was so great.  Mine was dry, I only ate a quarter of it.  Brought the rest home.  I'm staring at it and considering just throwing the darn thing away.  Why waste all those calories?   We hung out for way longer than normal people do since we were catching up and they were cool with it so that was nice.  There was a nice variety of people there too.  Something about it made me like the place even more.  A table next to us was a family with teenage children, they held hands and said prayer before they ate, the table on the other side was a really hot same sex couple, behind were super fit people who must have just finished hiking b/c they looked like it and I bet they ordered egg white and fruit or oatmeal.  I like it, it had a good vibe.  The patio looked inviting too but hell, it's already too hot to go outside, so I have no interest in that area.

Dutch Bros. Coffee definitely have not disappointed the Valley.  The staff's cheery demeanor is greatly appreciated and they make a good cup o' joe. The frozen treats look good, but I have never had one.

Mbar has a good, luxurious atmosphere.   My drinks were made perfect, it's hard to mess up a dirty vodka martini.  Sitting inside was a nice mood setting.  Once moving outside, it was comfortable- got chilly but we were not sitting by the heat lamps on the patio part.    Mbar is a great place to sit and enjoy a nice cocktail with friends.  I will return and I hope to walk around and see more of the beautiful setting.

Gals pals headed to Postino for a little Happy Time and had a great time!  Surprisingly, a table was ready to go for us so we sat  and enjoyed some wine (for them) and a mimosa (for me).  Yes, I ordered a mimosa at Happy Hour, it was really refreshing.  A little bonus was Mayor Gordon was sitting next to us, that was a nice surprise!     We didn't order any food this time around, well, we ordered olives, that doesn't really count.  They were good but $5 for a small-ish bowl-- not a big deal, they were really good.   Valet is complimentary, but you should tip.  Staff was all really nice and attentive.  The outside patio is really inviting, maybe not when it is 110* outside, but in soon time, I am looking forward to sitting out there and enjoying many more mimosas, wine, beer, olives, bruschetta.

Really great tacos!  The fish and carne asada tacos taste fresh and delicious, al beit small, but they are only $2 each so order as many as you like!  The chips and quac are perfect!  I love thick crunchy not too greasy but just enough chips and the guac is FRESH, real and as posted has a tint of oranges in there-- so good.  I also had the frijoles and holy moly frijole- they were gooood.  My friend had the elote-con queso and said was was fabulous.  It is a simply clean menu with high quality taste--   I can't wait to plan a get together with friends there and have some drinks and food too!  This trip was food only.   Not to mention the breakfast menu had me craving eggs really bad.  http://www.galloblancocafe.com/

Since the first time I have visited GB, it has warmed up quite a bit--- I am not certain they have the proper A/C unit for this space..... seriously, it was an OVEN in there multiple times this summer.  So these 2 stars are just for the SWAMPY feeling and massive heat stroke I nearly experienced in GB.   I will not be returning until AFTER the summer....

So.... this review is going to be a bit tough to do since my memory of being here is somewhat limited but here are the highlights that equal 4 stars from this foggy girl's memory:  1.  TATE TOTS:  I ate some tater tots off my friend plate, they were good.  2.  They serve beer in these really large cool goblets.... those looked fun.  I didn't have beer but the goblets were cool to look at.  3.  Easy to find location-- this helps when vision is impaired but of course, I wasn't driving, but I did see it from the street.  4.  The Patio:  nice patio, comfortable  5.  Server seemed nice, she did bring me many glasses of water that ended up watering the gravel outside but I insisted on refills.

From the moment I saw The Parlor's website and the building off Camelback Rd., I knew I was going to love this place.  We celebrated a birthday dinner for a friend, just 4 good friends together in a booth- we were each greeted by friendly smiling hostesses and seated in a comfortable booth.  Started off with a bottle of Seghesio-Zin, Parlor Insalata and Caprese. The salads were excellent and plentiful-- the caprese mozzarella was really delicious.  Moved onto 3 pizzas:  the Funghi, the Smokey and the Margherita (with sausage added) and they were all sooo good.  The Funghi was my favorite despite my love for meats.  Since it was my friend's birthday, they bring over a piece of to die for chocolate cake with italian cherries and vanilla cream-- oh my!  SO decadent.  Our server was so nice too, she was cool-- we liked her.   Then we topped the night off with more great conversation and laughs .  The Parlor was a sure hit and I already can think of future moments that need to be spent there, especially on the patio.

I joined a bowling league to give me something to do on Monday nights that didn't involve me spending oodles of cash because Mondays for some reason made me want to shop.  I love to shop for anything!   So I was a full blown card carrying leaguer but didn't have my own ball UNTIL TODAY, when I went into Bowl 300 "just to look" and see what my options were.  I met the nicest man, Mike Calderon, he is the owner and was very knowledgeable and helpful for me to get my first real ball.  We picked one out for me and he took my hand measurements and he drilled the holes to fit me perfectly.  I now have a ball all for me--- just for me.  :o)  Not just a ball, but a bag and shoe covers (I already had shoes, but I will be coming back to Bowl 300 for some cool shoes they have there!).  Glad I came into Bowl 300 because the service was so fast and friendly and he made me feel excited and happy to be a bowler.  Maybe my average will improve finally!!   YEAH BOWLING!!!!!!!   *** and the real 5th star:  He came by the bowling alley to see how I was doing with the new ball.  Seriously, that was so cool.  The pro shop is in the same strip as the alley.  Talk about serious customer service.

lumpia! lumpia! lumpia!  I feel as though I have died and gone to LUMPIA heaven.  They are tricky to make-- just really time consuming and it leaves yuor kitchen messy so eating them when you didn't make them yourself is such a treat!   We started off with lumpia and then had the pancit.  Panict was not 5 star--- I like mine more dry, so the one I make at home is better in my opinion.  But it was still really good.  HALO HALO-- oh my!  I have not had halo halo since 1993 so the minute it hit my mouth, an entire flash of memories came back to me!  It's very interesting and has a lot going on in it, some stuff I love, other stuff, I pick around.    I can't wait to go back and try the adobo, and some of the more mexican type foods.  The people working-- owner and family are sooo nice and really friendly, that makes for an excellent experience!  I am looking at my schedule seeing when I can get back there again---

The Christmas stuff is up and the Halloween candy is out!  Welcome to Costco!   The new Costco at PV Mall is super nice!  It just opened and it's so clean and new and everyone is so nice.  The parking lot is a bit funky, the way it is positioned on the lot, you park on the sides of it.    I walked up to get my brand new clean and unbroken cart, that feeling right there is enough to make me squeal with excitement, I hate grocery carts.   It's laid out like every other single Costco, so nothing new in that department.  The staff is really nice and helpful.    The best part is that the location on Beardsley will probably half the traffic since this one went up on Cactus.

Giant Coffee is what you would get if Apple decided to open a coffee house.   It's pretty cool and fresh- sleek.  Fantastic coffee and super modern twists to the shop and presentation.    We stopped in to buy some pastries for a work thing and ended up sitting and having some coffee and hitting up Bunky Bourtique right next to it.  (this was all after having lunch at Thai Hut in the freestanding building right next to it.)    Everyone there was a loner, sitting with their apple computers checked in and super quiet, and then we- me and the gang walked in and it seemed like it was the most conversation the place had going on in a long time.  But no biggie.   The coffee was strong, the pastries were sweet and we all went home happy.

The name says it all- G*R*E*A*T!  About $10 a person and by far THE BEST CHINESE buffet I have ever been.  All the foods were made fresh and restocked continuously.  Typically I run from the sushi at these places, but Great China's sushi was actually ok.  They even had Dim Sum that was done right.  The lo mein was perfect.  There was a huge variety of veggies, chicken dishes, beef dishes, shrimp, fish dishes-- all were superb.  The egg rolls were delicious and made to perfection.  I was very happy with Great China.  You must try this place.

Of all the Goodwill's I have been to, this location has got to be the best I have visited.  I purchased my first piece of furniture at this 19th Ave/Happy Valley Rd. location.  It is the perfect vintage arm chair. So excited!  When I walked in, I could tell instantly that it was one of the better locations.  It was bright, clean and well organized.  Not a bunch of junk laying around and much better selection in the stuff I like best like handbags, books and kitchenwares.  The drop off area is covered, which is really nice too and the building is new.  I plan on finding more treasures here.  I am smitten.

I finally stopped by this thrift shop.  They use the donated items sold profit to help rescue rabbits.  How absolutely adorable is that?  The thrift shop has some good stuff.  Like all thrift shops, it's a different store each time you visit.  I did spot a few great items for Halloween costumes and theme parties.  The best part is that it isn't picked over like the Goodwills and not nearly as crowded.  I was also able to find some super cute vintage picture frames and other odds and ends.  I will make sure to donate my next "clean out and get rid of stuff" bags to Brambley Hedge Rabbit Rescue.  They have rabbits in the store too!!  It's worth a stop by... see you there!

It's hit or miss here at Ocean Luxury. Sometimes it's amazing and sometimes it isn't.  I think it really depends on who you get.  They have a nice selection of polish.  The place is clean and comfortable.  They tend to run on the late side, even for appointments.

I am impressed.  Dollar Tree next to Target is fantastic!  I went Grand Opening weekend, without knowing it was the Grand Opening.  It was like walking into a newly remodeled house, it smelled new and a lot like plastic and stuff for a $1.  I think this is the nicest Dollar Store I have been in, the party supply disposable section is really nice. It had everything you could ever as for and of course all priced at only $1.

I had 2 Treehouse Bakery cupcakes at  birthday party and let me tell ya how DELICIOUS they were!  I was immediately in love with the vanilla cupcake, so I basically stole the other one and packed it away to take home- ha!  What a party guest I am huh?  I was told they were vegan and I was looking forward to trying them.  I was super impressed, I think I liked these better than non vegan cupcakes.  the icing was the perfect mixture of sweetness, I hate anything too sweet and artificial tasting- and quite honestly, the frosting makes up at least 50% of a cupcake so I was more than satisfied.  Way to go, Treehouse!

hallelujah- there is some pork up here in the north(kinda)west valley!  My favorite thing about this place is that you can buy the pork by the pound.  I think it's about $14, which sounds a bit spendy, but it is worth it.   The sandwiches are amazing.  If you are in the area and want a hefty lunch- you gotta go to Pork on a Fork!

Picture Show is like a boutique movie theater, I love it!  Fairly small and quaint. The staff are uber friendly and the theater is neat and clean.  I like the not so big box office-ness of The Picture Show.  Easy to park at PV Mall too.

My company (not the one I don't own, the one that employs me) uses Sonoran Studios for all our audio/visual needs.  I really had no idea what A/V was or why you would need to hire an outside company to do the sound, video production, lighting etc until we had our first event using Sonoran and let me tell ya.... we are never going back.  Sonoran's team is first class, easy to work with, and just cool people.    I've been to an awards event and sat through really painfully lame videos with bad editing and cheesy music with awful lighting on the people--- It is nice to know with Sonoran, you will never have that horrible experience.  I feel like they do it all and make it looks so easy and soooo good!  I highly recommend.

Dunkin coffee never seems to be strong enough.  Of course any coffee will do when you need it but I recommend getting it from some place else if you can.  Dunkin is a matter of convenience for me when I am in great need and that's about it.

So chill, So delicious and So priced well.  The Living Room is a great place to kick back and relax on a date or with a group of friends.  The drinks are made well, generous and affordably priced.  The menu goes above and beyond "bar food" and has enough to interest pretty much anyone.  My favorite was the sausage sliders- WOW!  Delicious! And when you need a french fry fix, this is your place!  Portions are big, so perfect for sharing.

Happy Hour until 7pm- this is fantastic, many places end HH at 6pm so this was a nice bonus.  1/2 price appetizers as well.  We had the deviled eggs, lamb chops and chicken wings.  It was a lot of food with a lot of great flavors!  The lamb chops were delicious, cooked perfectly and had the perfect amount of seasoning.    The crowd for a Tuesday was mellow, there was live music.    A great spot for a meal or just drinks.  The Garage may be one of my new favorite picks!

The Urban Outfitters downtown is much smaller than most of the others I have been in, otherwise it is just like all the others.  It's a nice addition to Downtown Phoenix though.    The center area by the register is my favorite spot in Urban Outfitters, a place filled with silly stuff, great for gifts and many of them making you chuckle.  Think Jesus action figure.  :)    What I particularly noticed was an entire wall of old school camera and film, like the Diana and  film that had funny names that I have never heard-- You know Hipstamatic iPhone app- it's the camera and film that really did some of those settings.  Very cool!!  If you work in the area, I suggest stopping in to break up your long work day and have a good laugh, the book section is hysterical!

Kitchen Consignment Store to sell lightly used kitchen stuffs and to purchase.  What a great idea!  I popped in today to Kitchen Switchin' just to check it out and see what they have going on... I would like to get rid of a few kitchen things I have and since it is consignment, you can get 45% of the sold price in cash OR 55% of the sold price in store credit.  This is pretty standard in the consignment world.  You have to wait for the item to sell before you reap the rewards.  Although a big reward is paring down at home so that happens instantly when you start getting rid of things that you simply do not use.    They have some great stuff!  I wanted a few items, like a fantastic mojito making thing, it was only $6.95.  They also had a Dyson hand vac that I would love to own, that priced out at $79, but retails for WAY more.  Already getting my things together to bring over and I recommend, you do the same- nothing like making room for MORE!  :)

Pretzel Fondu is a must.  Besides the fact that I keep calling the place, "The Arrogant Bastard" instead of Butcher- I just love the name.  I had the fish and chips, which were pretty spectacular, not greasy, but perfectly fried and crisp with a ton of flavor.    The setting is excellent, the ambience is relaxed and plentiful.  Just lots of space and coolness to it.  They have private "meeting room" dining areas too that closes off to the rest of the restaurant.  This is something that is needed downtown for the many private lunches that take place.  The bathrooms were really fantastic too- user friendly, I like that about a restroom.  Big flat-screens above the bar area too, which is good for the evening crowd.    I can't wait to get back!

Great vibe. After you valet the car (you have to- it's the only option) you walk into an outdoor area very similar to postino Arcadia.  Head inside and be greeted by a lovely hostess.  We sat at the bar with a carafe of wine.  All wine is served in a carafe, ala on tap style.  I like this.  The bar is in the center of the restaurant in a super chic way that you can observe what is going on around you and kinda hideout or be seen- the choice is yours.    We were seated in what I think was the best seats in the house.  It was in a corner booth that was right at the corner of the restaurant.  Once we all slid into our booth seats, we all agreed it was like hunkering down in a basement somewhere on a leather couch.   We were introduced to Dan, the super slim, urban hipster server with a nice face and a witty personality.  When asked if my burger would be better with fries or mac n cheese, he asked me how often I eat burgers with mac n cheese? uhh, so yeah, I ordered the mac n cheese--- GREAT choice!   We started with the Smorgash board that had pita, cheese, the most kale chips and largest kale chips I have ever seen, hummus, some veggies and smoked salmon-- it was interesting enough, but I probably won't be ordering that again.  But since they just opened, I am happy to try anything on the menu!  Entrees included the waldorf salad that was only so-so, it was called "a bit too much" by a friend, the Barley salad was a huge hit as was the corn chowder.  My burger was good, I recommend going easier on the caramelized onions.  I felt like it started to taste more like a dessert before I even got half way through it.  After we ate, relaxed and Dan check on us the perfect amount of time, we walked through and headed next door to Churn for dessert.  We passed the bar, said hello to a few friends we ran into, observed the outdoor seating one more time, and then walked though a hallway decorated in old cassette tapes, that was awesome!   At the end of the hallway was a bathroom marked "ladies and gents"- I absolutely despise shared bathrooms.  So that grossed me out thoroughly.  But as we made the turn, I saw the candies and ice cream that awaited me just around the corner....

This particular location seems to not have as long of a line as others... but of course that could be timing.  Anyhow, I hit up this US Post Office because it is close to my house.  There isn't anything over the top great, nor is there anything so over the top awful.  Basically, it's a post office, people.

Ice Cream and Candy Delicious-ness galore!  After dining at Windsor, simply take a few steps on over to Churn for some homemade out of this world super creamy ice cream.  It's like a mini candy store filled with cookies and ice cream.  The staff happily offered a few tastings.  I thought I was going to get the Strawberry but then I tasted the blueberry ice-cream.  It was so good and different.    We got out cool treats and then enjoyed eating it on the patio and having a little chat and people watching.    What an adorable place with good ice cream to boot!  See you soon.

PVBC really surprised me!  The menu is easy, I like easy.  The burger came out fast, way faster than I expected.  I got the bacon cheddar and it was really delicious.  They add a slice of cucumber and pickled onions, it was such a great treat.  The bread was glazed with butter.  COME ON... THAT BURGER WAS LEGIT.  SO GOOD.  I ordered the tater tots, they only have sweet potato ones and I wasn't feeling the, but my friend ordered fries and she shared.  Nice portion size and the price point is spot on.   Drinks are cans or bottles, I prefer a soda machine or fresh iced tea (I think they had fresh iced tea, I must have missed it).  My only gripe is that there isn't a can recycle bin. If that's my only gripe, I call it a good deal. I can bring my can home with me if it bothers me.    I'm going back, that is FOR SURE.

I attended a private party in the speakeasy.  It was quite a fantastic set up!  Super cozy and intimate with a decent sized patio and pool table.  Television, couches, chairs.  It was really great.  The ordering was a bit confusing, there was an ipad involved but it was just easier to ask to server for what we wanted.

burger heaven! I had THE PIG Burger... it. was. delicious.  and it was served on a pretzel roll.  mmmmmm  Good vibe feeling in Circle H, I like the pictures on the walls, the bar look, the entire environment was relaxed and easy going.  I came the day of the official ribbon cutting, so I got to see that happen (i had no idea those giant gold scissors were real scissors by the way.  i guess, that is a dumb though b/c what else would they be??) and it was nice to see everyone gathered for this moment.  The french fires were piping hot and delicious, they have all sorts of sides like slaw, beans, mac n cheese etc.    I also had a bite of the brisket sandwich.  It was so very very good, I am ordering that next time I go back.    Local beers on tap, good price too.  Great start for a new restaurant, there were of course the new hickups, but those kins get worked out with more time. Nothing to worry about.  That's how you learn!!

Wy-Not is the old Perc Up (and before that Toast and then before that Drip) and I have to say, I like the food, coffee, and service better here at Wy-Not Cafe.  It's hearty and healthy.  Nothing greasy or heavy, just the perfect blend for everyone.  Options for Veggies and Vegans, which is a plus so I don't have to hear people complain about no options for them.  The name came from the new owner's dog, named Wyatt.  The patio is dog friendly.  The inside is cozy and chill.  They serve breakfast and lunch, closes at 3pm, take note.  I had the classic breakfast burro, it was stuffed with eggs, potatoes, cheese, bacon- it was large and delicious.  I tried a baked pancake too, it was crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside.    I hope to see Wy-Not around in the future, as we hang at this coffee spot regularly, the owners have changed at least 3 times that I can remember in the past couple years.  We keep coming, but that is more because of location and familiarness from family members but I personally like Wy-Not the best so far of the others.

I had a groupon to turn-style consignment, so I popped in to use it and check it out for the first time.  I was impressed.  The place is clean, organized and the space is large.  It's easy to find things.  There  was a variety of clothing for men/women (mostly women), clothing, accessories, furniture, housewares, linens, home decor items.  The prices were very reasonable.    The dressing rooms were spacious and had the right amount of hooks and hanging bars, that is major plus... I can't stand when dressing rooms are tight and the hooks are missing.  It's a sweatfest in most dressing rooms and it's disgusting- not at Turn-Style, it's great!!  It's April right now and they are still accepting winter, which was cool, b/c most places don't but they said they have space to store it for next season.    I found a few good items, a top for $8.50, a dress for a roaring 20's themed party for $12 (it was on sale and half off!), and 2 vintage necklaces.  I think I did pretty well for a first timer.

Doc Popcorn has landed in Scottsdale, AZ.  Located in Scottsdale Fashion Center on the 3rd floor by Nordstroms, you will find the best popcorn in town.  If you can't see the bright yellow signs, you will be able to smell the buttery, perfectly popped corn wafting through the mall.   They have all sorts of cool interesting flavors like cinnamon and jalepeno.  THey also have the classics like butter, cheddar, kettle corn and more!  It's all popped fresh right there and are naturally flavored.   Pick up a bag and chomp away!

I can appreciate good popcorn. Here at Doc Popcorn, they know what they are doing. They were in Scottsdale Fashion Square, but have since moved to AZ Mills. The best part about this popcorn is it isn't greasy, I appreciate movie theater popcorn too but the greasy-ness if it always leaves me feeling a little sick. Not at Doc!! Full of flavor and half the calories. My favorite is the cheddar. So good, it's worth the orange fingers.   They also do tins, bulk popcorn, a great gift. We sent them out for a work event to clients. So delicious and easy!

While I type this I just rejoiced on how fast my food came out after I ordered it. It's because it was pre-made. No worries, speed is needed at the airport. But oh my. This may be the grossest $8 breakfast burrito ever. Egg, cheese, bacon in a tortilla. Not a lick of any spice. Just runny eggs. Not even a dash of pepper. Nothing. Avoid this place. You are better off eating a bag of pepperoni flavored combos from the newsstand.

Best Short Rib Taco I have ever had. Urban Taco is a small business that packs in big flavor. The salsa variety was a fun experiment to try them all. We were with a large group so it was a bit harder to figure out what was what but with a table for 2 or 4, it would be nice.   This place isn't a quick turn over restaurant. So settle in, enjoy the company and your salsas and you'll be fine.   Beer, Wine and Tequila. Pretty basic here and done well.

Oh, Urban Vince... I think I'm in LOVE with you.  It's quaint, it's sweet, the flavors are robust and interesting- it's everything you need in a neighborhood restaurant. The outdoor patio is ready for some visitors, let's hope it cools down soon.   I enjoyed my New York strip. Maybe too much since I had planned on eating half and taking the rest home. Nope.  I ended up eating it all. I was able to try many other meals too (the joy of dining with friends!). The pasta dish was savory, I could eat an entire plate of the cabbage, rice noodle side- it was truly divine. The cakes were cooked perfectly. Dessert usually isn't my thing but I was impressed with the cobbler, and cobbler never impresses me.   The ambiance is really quaint, like you are at home and comfortable. You can tell a lot of thought went into design and decor. The tin ceiling, the light fixtures and wall decor are all visually appealing and kitschy.   I'm going back without a doubt. See ya there! Cheers.

Great little neighborhood hangout! Fast service and good choices of beer and wine.  I had the Italian Salad with chicken added- it was pretty tasty.  I enjoyed it.  I also tried some flatbread and thought it was delicious!  Wish I ordered that actually.  We started with some meats and cheeses for an appetizer, it was a good start to our meal.

Let me start by apologizing to anyone who has ever baked me a cake or given me a cake prior to A Bakeshop's cake.   I was gifted with a lively, simple classic vanilla cake this week from a Bakeshop and I can say I have never eaten a more delicious tasting vanilla cake in my life.   It was aromatic with the sweetness of sugar and cream but not over powered. By the time I even took a bite, I knew this cake was going to be delicious.   I was right. Tasting became an entire experience that had the perfect amount of sweet and the exact, and I say exact, amount of salt that kept it grounded and tasty.   I will never enjoy another cake like I did from a Bakeshop. They will have my business from this point forward.   A true slice of Heaven. Well done, you will go places and I will follow.

New to the neighborhood and perfect place to grab a bite to go or sit and enjoy. The owner and staff are friendly and willing to answer questions, offer suggestions. Lots of homemade goodness for lunch. Cheaper than fast food, healthier and more delicious. There are your classic wraps, sandwiches, salads, soups & specials. They even make their own veggie burgers!! Glad I found this little gem. It's in an office building and so perfect for grabbing a bite.

Want to impress someone?  Order them a Nothing Bundt Cake pronto!    The bundt cakes are absolutely the prettiest and yummiest dessert that can be delivered to the recipients door.    The cake is moist and heavenly tasting.  The cream cheese frosting is SCRUMPTIOUS and the whole concept is just too cute to pass up.  EAT SOME BUNDT CAKE NOW.  It's just kinda funny that it's a bundt cake, you don't see many bundt cakes around these days.

Wow! What a great concept. Fast, healthy, fresh, delicious and affordable food. Salad and Go is a great addition to the area. Every salad I have ordered has been fantastic. I order the cob most often and add steak with half the dressing mixed in. I think I could eat this everyday.   The staff is so friendly and always has a smile. Just a nice place to go and grab lunch.
