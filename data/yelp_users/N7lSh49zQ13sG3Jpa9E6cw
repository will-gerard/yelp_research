Bland, blech, barf.   That's pretty much how I feel about Wild Thaiger. The food here is the farthest thing from authentic as it could get without venturing into Lean Cuisine territory. I suppose, though, it was the closest us downtowners had to real Thai, until Thai Hut and Thai Elephant moved in. (You are on notice, Wild Thaiger!)   I think I gave it a fair shake. I ate here a total of four times, with different people and different food. I was not impressed once. In fact, I was pretty disgusted twice to find a long black hair weaving itself through my molded mound of rice.   No spice. No life. No business from me.

I don't know what else I can say that hasn't already been said about Fate, but here goes.   The food at Fate is like a warm spicy Asian orgasm on a plate. The martinis send me to another level of heaven. Johnny Chu is a genius and  I will cry if he ever leaves Phoenix.  I think that about covers it.

Big scary Grand Avenue has the best kept secret ever- the Paisley Violin.  I've been visiting the Paisley since it's days on Roosevelt street, and it's easily one of my favorite spots in the city.   Everything about the place is just good- the people, the atmosphere, the food. The International Eggwiches- egg sandwiches on a bagel- are great for breakfast; any of them will hit the spot nicely. Lunch is always a tougher choice because there are just too many good things on the menu. I am particularly fond of the Hummus plate and the Paprika turkey sandwich, but most everything else has been amazing as well. (I'd stay away from the Champs d'Elysses sandwich though, it's much too heavy on the brie) The daily iced tea is always unusual but usually good, and the soup of the day is never subpar. The last time I was there, the not-so-traditional potato soup was heavenly.   The coffee and espresso are great, although I can't say too much about the frou frou drinks because I don't drink them. I imagine they'd be great too, with as good as the coffee is.   Go...eat...you won't regret it...and on your way out, pay a visit to the Paisley pigs in the back. That's right, there are two little pigs residing at the Paisley, and they're pretty cute- for pigs.

I brought my dad here a couple of weeks ago, just on a whim. I'd been once before when the previous owners still had the place, and I had been itching to go back.   We went for an early lunch so we were able to sit inside. The staff is friendly, and I think my dad enjoyed the fact that every time the waitress turned around, her rear end was right in his face. Dirty old men in close quarters. What can you do?   The food was great- I had the grilled cheese (minus pickles), he had a burger and we both had fries. I loved the grilled cheese- it was perfectly charred- and he had no complaints about the burger, which is a rare thing. The fries were perfection and I may have even dreamed about them that night.   I can't imagine eating here would be too fun in the middle of the summer, as most of the seating is outside, but it's a great little lunch spot, and they're also open late on First Fridays. Good to know, since getting food anywhere else downtown on a First Friday is next to impossible.   I'll definitely be back.

Scott's has become one of the go-to places on our list of Sunday breakfast spots. The food is great, the service is good, and the brownies are to die for.   You won't find anything fancy here- the food is simple, wholesome and tasty. The french toast is perfect. I was informed by one of our breakfast crew that the chorizo is way too spicy, but I don't know why you'd order chorizo in a Jewish deli when there are so many other good things on the menu.   On my last visit, I had a veggie omelet. That thing was as big as my head, served with yummy potatoes, and provided two tasty breakfasts. Whatever Scott's lacks in style, they make up for in cheese. Holy hell, was there cheese. Not a bad thing, just a little overwhelming.   The brownies are to die for. I haven't tasted a better brownie since...well, I just can't remember. Scott's brownies are cakey, perfectly moist, slathered in a not-too-sweet frosting, and they're HUGE.   Give Scott's a try. The menu is large enough that there really is something for everyone. I doubt you'll be disappointed.

We heard about this place from some friends when we showed up to their place, and there it was- Heaven in a box.   We had it delivered again last night, and it was still damn good.   The chicken alfredo pizza is amazing. It has just the right amount of everything- moist chicken, alfredo sauce, spinach, parmesan- and nothing is overwhelming or too rich.   The Queen Margherita was a hit too- basil, tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella- wow. I could have eaten the entire pie myself.   The prices are on par with what you'd expect to pay at Z Pizza, and it's worth it. The crust isn't greasy at all- it's perfect.   They have other things- sandwiches and salads, etc. but I haven't ventured beyond the pizza section of the menu yet.   They do deliver, but sadly for me I live two blocks south of the cut off point. Boo hoo.

Sun is probably my favorite bike shop- and I frequent bike shops since my bike is always broken. They have a great selection of Nirve, Electra, Phat, Schwinn, and others- plus a nice smattering of vintage bikes for sale. The selection of parts and accessories is large too- if you don't see what you want, ask. Chances are, they have it in the back.   The staff is great- they'll help you find what you need, recommend something new, or order what you're looking for.   The prices are comparable to other bike shops, but the service is why Sun has been so successful.

Linda's won't win any awards for the decor, but the food is so very tasty. I visited a few Sundays ago for breakfast and had the best biscuits and gravy. My companions were happy with their breakfast choices as well.   This is an inexpensive, friendly little place. Everything is homemade, and worth a try.

If people in heaven eat, Havana Cafe is doing the catering.   We had dinner here last night. When we first walked in, the decor and the plastic chairs were a bit off-putting, given the menu isn't exactly full of budget meals. But we quickly got over that when the Capirinhias arrived.   The food:  Potage de Frijoles Negros- hands down the best black bean soup i've ever had. I could easily eat just this for days.   Pollo Cubano- The chicken and onions are very citrusy, and the meat is tender. You really have to like onions to fully appreciate this dish. Three stars.  Gallina Frita- Fantastic. The shredded chicken was full of flavor, and the onions and spices complemented each other perfectly. The rice and beans that come with this dish are different (Moros) than the standard, and they are wonderful. The dish also comes with plantains, which are good, if you like plantains. Five stars.  Chicharrones de Pollo- I wasn't a big fan of this one. It's fried chicken, but it had a very odd flavor from the citrusy marinade. I guess I am too ingrained in my ways regarding fried chicken because this just didn't do it for me. Another strange thing about this dish is the chicken itself- rather than having a leg or a thigh, the fried chicken pieces were the meat pieces used for making chicken wings. Two stars.  Bistecs Cubanos (Encevollado style) - I don't like beef. This steak, however, is probably the one beef dish I could eat with abandon. The meat is pounded thin and smothered with onions. Five stars, because I hate beef, and I loved this.   Pudin de Pan con Helado- I tend to shy away from bread pudding because of the usually disgusting consistency. We ordered this on a recommendation from the server, though, and it was fantastic. Chocolate bread pudding with chocolate chips....yum. Top it with ice cream and you've made a great thing even better. Four stars.   We didn't try anything from the tapas menu, or any of the other entrees that sound delicious. We'll definitely be back.

Crackers has been a long term staple for me, held over from my days as a Mesa resident. You just can't go wrong here.   Offering breakfast and lunch, everything on the menu sounds delicious and everything i've had was even better. I'd love to be able to say that i've tried everything, but let's be real here- it's a big menu.   Crackers offers an average of six different soup selections every day, with one or two daily specials. Same with dessert- daily selections may vary. Both are homemade- no boxes or cans here- and they taste like the best thing your mom ever made for you, only maybe a little better. (assuming your mother was a good cook)   The breakfast offerings are hearty and full of flavor, the lunch offerings run the gamut from light snack to full blown food coma material. Great stuff.   Like Meredith said, the decor isn't anything special- it hasn't changed much in the 15 years or so since  I first ate here. I think they're going for homey country charm. It doesn't matter though- this isn't a place to go for ambiance, unless you're a reclusive Mormon housewife.   Crackers has two other locations- one out in east Mesa and one in Tempe. I haven't been to either of those, but this one is definitely a winner.

What I thought was decent upon the first visit, had somehow morphed into mediocre and in some cases, disgusting. What the heck happened?  I agree with the other reviewers about the ratio of rice to fish- its ridiculous how much rice they cram into their nigiri.   We did do the all you can eat sushi deal, and I was totally taken aback by the waitress's admonition that we will get charged for what we don't eat. Excuse me? We didn't order extravagantly, and I doubt what we got would have totaled the $20 charge for the AYCE.   Anyway, the sushi itself was about as flavorful as a ten dollar bill. I love eel, and they managed to screw up the eel so badly that it tasted like cardboard and had the texture of dry, severely overcooked fish. The yellowtail sashimi just didn't taste right, and I paid for that one for the rest of the night. Ouch.   Ah well. At least the sake is cheap and good.

I've been here about 5 times total, and I am completely unimpressed.   The food is overpriced and just not worth it. I have no problem paying for a good meal, but this wasn't a good meal. I could have made what ended up on my plate from the contents of my refrigerator and it would have tasted better.   The one caveat to my "My Florist has crappy food" attitude is the cinnamon scones. These are absolute heaven. Too bad I won't be back for them, as getting one means dealing with the rude staff.   Out of the five visits, only once was the service decent, and I think it was only because my dining companion knew the server. That's bad. I never went in dressed like a bum or treated the staff obnoxiously, but yet the staff had no problem treating me like a second class citizen who didn't belong in the restaurant. I don't know what kind of qualifications you have to have to get decent service here, but I obviously don't have them.   I won't be back ever. It's a shame, too, because it is within walking distance.

Do you like trendy shit-music and half dressed plastic surgery queens gyrating all around you, while you pay twelve dollars for your appletini? If your answer is yes, don't bother coming here.   Dive bars are plentiful in Phoenix, but the Bikini is in my 'hood. It's a dirty, unassuming place, with a couple of no-nonsense bartenders and a good jukebox.   There are a couple of rules to follow when visiting the Bikini:   1. Bring cash. Cards aren't accepted, the atm machine is there for decoration only, as it hasn't worked in at least two years.   2. Don't make fun of the guy in the overalls and farmer hat. He's my neighbor.   3. Don't piss off the bartenders. Tip them well, treat them nicely, and don't order more than three dirty martinis. If you are nice to them, they will be nice to you. This includes, but is not limited to: the strength of your drinks, the price of your drinks, and whether or not you get a drink at all. They take no shit.   If you can't handle it, stay away. The place gets crowded enough as it is.

There is nothing more frustrating than taking your pet to the vet because you think something is wrong with him, and having the vet completely ignore everything you tell her. This is why I do not take my dogs to Alta Vista anymore.   I took my older dog to Alta Vista after we adopted him because it was close, and I had a free exam certificate from the shelter. The vet seemed nice enough, and I'll give her a pass on the fact that she clearly had no idea what breeds he might be (she told us he'd get 50 pounds, max, when full grown today, he's 70).   So, figuring that they were ok from the first visit, I took him in when he started having issues. Vet #1 "thought" he might have bladder crystals, and sent him home with expensive prescription food and an order to come back in 4 weeks.   Vet #2, on the return visit, completely disregarded everything that had been written in my dog's chart as well as everything I told her, and wanted to run a bunch of expensive tests. Vet #1 had told me he'd just need a retest for the crystals, Vet #2 wanted to send him through the ringer. No thanks.   We got the hell out of there as fast as we could manage. I don't do doctors who don't listen. She may have the degree, but I live with the dog and know what he is and isn't doing.   Needless to say, we haven't been back. And my dog? He's perfectly fine.

Joe's Crap Shack is a more accurate name for this overpriced, tasteless restaurant.   I'm not sure what we were thinking when we decided to eat lunch here yesterday. One of my dining companions was lured by the word "crab" and a stomach twisting hunger, so we stopped in. Everything on the menu sounded good in theory, but it didn't pan out so well in practice.   For $9.95, I expected the crab cake sandwich to be almost a work of art- succulent crab, perfectly spiced and neatly fried. Instead, the sandwich was a lukewarm lump, devoid of flavor, unless you count the lingering aftertaste of old fish. The remoulade sauce served with the sandwich was tasty with fries, but it did nothing to save the sandwich from the pits of nastiness. The crunchy fish sandwich is usually served with cheese. I asked for mine without, but regretted it immediately. The fish fillets were the blandest I have ever had, and the cheese probably provides the only flavor this sandwich has. Honestly, i've had better fish fillets from the frozen section of the grocery store. Another thing to dislike about the crunchy fish sandwich is the fact that they didn't serve tartar sauce or any other condiment with it. Who has a dry fish sandwich? Blech.  The blackened tuna sandwich looked promising when it arrived at the table, with  inch thick slab of tuna steak sitting atop the bun. One bite shattered that notion. The fish was dry and overcooked, while the blackening spice seemed to be more likely ground up charcoal. No taste.   The one redeeming aspect to our lunch was the crab dip. That was really tasty, but I doubt if i'd return for just that.   Skip Joe's Crap Shack if you're in the mood for ocean critters. I wish we had. I felt dirty and cheap after paying our $46 lunch bill and walked out of the place very unsatisfied, and a little pissed.

I'm probably the lone dissenter in the land of Five star reviews here, but here goes.   I wanted to love Matt's. It's adorable and close to home.   I don't eat pork, which eliminated a good portion of the menu right off the bat. That's fine, it's not like I expect restaurants to cater to me, that's what my kitchen is for.   I had the cheese omelet. It was good, but could have used some spices. The hash browns were ok, despite the fact that they were floating in their own grease.   Matt's is great if you like breakfast with a bucket of grease on the side. It made me sick, so I won't be back.

I've found a new grocery shopping destination...and I think I may be in love.   Sure, I don't know what half of the items on the shelves are used for, and I don't really care for dates, but there is just so much goodness in between the mystery items that it doesn't matter. I'm hooked.   The produce is cheap and much better than the comparably cheap Ranch market nearby, and you just can't beat a package of freshly made pita for fifty cents. The spice array is dizzying, and I really want to find out what one does with Pomegranate syrup.    One distinct advantage Baiz has over other markets is the meat counter. Where else in town can you get fresh lamb and goat?   Baiz market is so great that it now has a place in regular rotation on our grocery outings. As a bonus, the Al-Hana restaurant inside is a great place to grab a cheap but excellent meal during the trip.

This place is great. The people are nice, the coffee is so good, and the free wi-fi is definitely a bonus. My only complaint? That it isn't in my neighborhood.   That said, I go to Copper Star for the coffee. I could go somewhere closer, like one of the three coffee places within walking distance, but Copper Star does it better. The various bakery treats are okay, nothing phenomenal but certainly edible. I can't comment on the sandwiches, never having had one.   The tiny patio is nice for cooler weather or enjoying the day with your canine companion. Be warned, it fills up fast with only two tables.  ETA: Chocolate chip cookies have recently been added to the baked goods line- up, and man- are they amazing.

I would give the gelato six stars if I could. Yum.   Every batch is made from scratch, unlike other gelato joints in town, and the difference is obvious. I've tried just about every flavor there- except pistachio, because I hate pistachios- and they have all been exceptional.   Try the Vesuvio- available only on Friday and Saturday. While it is more expensive than the other flavors, it will leave you craving more.    It may be expensive compared to ice cream, but there's a reason for that. Ice cream could never be this good.

We ended up here last night after the first restaurant we tried to go to had an hour long wait. (thank you, first restaurant!) It's one of those places that  I have driven by a thousand times and never stopped in. I guess I now know what I've been missing for the last four and a half years.  The place has been serving Italian food for over fifty years. That's pretty crazy, when you consider how transient this city can be. The owners have changed, but the food is still fantastic.   I had the Fettucine Della Casa- fettucine with a tomato cream sauce, smothered with fresh mushrooms, roasted red peppers, proscuitto and chicken. It was amazing- rich, but not overpowering, flavorful but not overwhelming. My dining companion was not so over the moon about his order- Linguine Alla Vongole (clams sauteed with parsley and garlic, served over linguine with a white wine sauce)- but he admits that he thought he was getting something different than what actually showed up on the plate. He enjoyed the clams, but he thought the white wine sauce didn't have much flavor.   The bread and oil that starts the meal is so good, I could just eat that. The wine selection isn't too wide, but it's enough to ensure that there's something for everyone.   Our server was great. He was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The way he described the daily specials and dessert selections, you would have thought he crafted them himself.   The atmosphere in the restaurant is really nice. A romantic date wouldn't be out of place here, nor would a casual dinner with friends or family. There is no hint of pretentiousness anywhere, and they don't care how you're dressed or what you look like. Everyone is welcome here.  I can't wait to go back. There were so many dishes on the menu that sounded fantastic, and choosing one was hard. Time to try out the rest of them!

Do you fancy yourself a music snob? Then this is the place for you! If you can find it at Target, you probably won't find it here, which is why I love it. Within the confines of the four tiny walls lies a treasure trove full of obscure, independent and local bands that you won't find anywhere else.   The listening stations are great- i've fallen in love with many new bands this way.   I love Stinkweeds. If I visited as often as i'd like to, I'd be living in a box. But hey, I'd be in a box with a kick-ass music collection.

What a great little place for home decor. Most of the items here are things you won't easily find anywhere else, imported from all over the world. The selection ranges from Asian to French inspired, with many eclectic items that I really don't know how to classify.  Some of my favorite things at Fig's are the vintage ceiling tiles and the rustic/ shabby chic furniture pieces. They're beautiful, and I dream about them because they wouldn't fit in my house. Ah well.   The prices are fair, considering the owner does all of the buying and importing himself. If you are looking for a unique decor item for your home or garden, try Fig's.

Mucho Gusto es mucho mierda.   Let me say first, that the place is cute, the staff is friendly, and the salsa is good. There. I'm not being a total jerk.   The food, however, left much to be desired. I couldn't find much to like about my chicken tacos- they were ok, but the meat didn't have much flavor, there was no cheese, and they were pretty stingy with the guacamole and pico. What really got me was that they didn't come with rice and beans. Instead, I got a lovely pile of cheap bagged romaine coated in some sort of caesar-ish dressing. Sure, there were a few cubes of cheese and a tomato slice (A slice!) on top, but come on. $14 for a couple of naked tacos and a pile of romaine? For that much, they could have at least picked the white core parts of the lettuce out of my salad. Or, I dunno, sprinkled a little cheese on the tacos?  The story was much the same with the fish tacos, only the salad was different. The enchiladas seemed to be a hit, and those are served with rice and beans. the vegan at the table ordered a side of rice and beans for her meal, and they aren't kidding about it being a side. I think my cat's food bowl is bigger.   They charge $1 per bowl if you want more chips. I know $1 isn't a big deal, but it's just the principle. I already felt ripped off from the entree, so the extra charge for the chips just made it worse.   Needless to say, I won't be going back. There are far better choices closer to home.

I just had lunch here for the first time in months. Man, i've missed it.   I can't speak for authenticity, never having been to Iraq or anywhere else in the middle east, but I can speak for flavor. Yum. In the many months since our discovery of this great little joint, we have worked our way through a good portion of the menu. We take friends and family to Fattoush, and no one has been disappointed yet. (except for the time they were closed due to a kitchen fire- that was pretty disappointing!)  Norma R. is right- there really isn't much atmosphere, so don't expect a romantic meal here. It's a no frills place, with friendly service and great food.  What more do you need?   Things like falafel, hummus and baba ghanoush rank high on my list of favorite foods, so this place is an automatic win for me. The flavors are incredible, particularly the smoky baba ghanoush and the tangy garlic dip. I could eat that stuff with a spoon. The falafel is the closest thing to garbanzo bean perfection that I have ever tasted.   The meat dishes, such as chicken shawarma and various kabobs, are all flavorful and fantastic. Served with rice and another side depending on what you order, these plates will fill you up and send you home happy.   For the light eaters, their pita sandwiches are fantastic and cheap. They'll cost you between $4-6, but they are huge and stuffed to the max.   All entrees (sandwiches too!) come with either salad or the fantastic lentil soup. Skip the salad. The soup is too good to ignore.

Yeah, I know it's a chain. So what? The burgers are awesome.   I don't eat beef, so the turkey burger is my meat on a bun choice. Most places don't know what to do with turkey- it's like a foreign substance they   try to rid themselves of as quickly as possible. Fatburger, though, knows how to do a dead turkey justice. The meat is seasoned and cooked perfectly, resulting in a very tasty sandwich.   The fries are great too- especially the fat ones. Yum.

Flaming Kabob, disguised as a former 5 & Diner, has been open at this location for a little over two years. Why, then, hasn't anyone reviewed it?   The staff was nice enough. The place was nearly empty at 1 pm on a Wednesday, yet service was remarkably slow. There were only two staff members in the front, but there were also only two other tables occupied while we were there.   I admit, after being spoiled with the wonderful Mediterranean cuisine of Fattoush, this place left me disappointed and yearning for my favorite little hole in the wall joint. There were seven of us, so we got to sample an array of what Flaming Kabob has to offer. Here's a run down:   Hits:  The Tabbouleh salad was tasty.  The rice, with golden raisins, was very moist and flavorful.  Chicken kabob was spot on.  The garlic sauce was good, but not as smooth as i've had other places.  Tasty iced tea. (garden variety)   Misses:  Baba ghanoush lacked flavor. Consistency was good.  Hummus could use more spice.  Falafel was overdone, almost to the point of being charred, yet soggy in the middle.  Spinach pie (spanakopita) was awful. Ricotta cheese and some odd spice that we couldn't name ruined this dish.  Chicken kofta was an odd texture. It's ground chicken, but there's something else about it.... Pitas came straight from a bag. Come on guys, can't you do any better?   And completely unrelated to the food.....the bathroom was out of toilet paper. Or seat covers. Or anything resembling a paper product that one might use after relieving themselves.   Final verdict: Don't waste your time or money. The prices are higher than many similar places- $8-9 for a lunch plate, the service is really slow, and it just isn't that good.

I love going out for breakfast on the weekends, but finding great places in the downtown area can be a challenge. Or, it used to be, until Palatte came along. Now, I think i'm in love.  The food is amazing. Everything on our table was delicious, and I wouldn't change a thing about any of it. I had the incredible Potato mish mash, and my dining companion loved the griddle cakes and a side of chicken sausage. The breakfast potatoes are tasty and cooked to perfection. The  toast was great- not your typical sandwich bread slices.    One thing that really endears me to this place is the fact that they do not serve tap water. It is a small thing, yes, but living in a city with horrid water makes me appreciate restaurants that take the extra care to serve their guests something that they themselves would drink.  I cannot say enough good things about this place. The atmosphere is great, even when the place is packed, decorated with French country flair and pieces that would make my living room swoon. The outdoor seating area is equally adorable, and huge. The majority of the items they have in and around the restaurant are for sale, and there is a small gift shop in the rear of the restaurant for other quirky items.   One last thing- if you go, and you should, do not leave Palatte without checking out the bathrooms. (both of them) You've never seen anything like it, promise.

Admittedly, I don't buy much when I visit Bunky, because I am a cheap bastard, but I do drool quite a bit.   Cute cute clothes from independent and local designers. If you don't mind spending some hefty bucks on your wardrobe, Bunky can help and you'll look fantastic.   Bunky makes me wish I weren't such a tightwad.

We stumbled upon this little place in a worn strip mall by accident, but it ended up being a very happy accident.   Yes, it is true that the decor will not be gracing the pages of fashion magazines anytime soon, but this is a clean, no-frills kind of place. There is also no point in coming here if you are pressed for time, because it is not fast food by any stretch of the imagination. Most importantly, the food is good. Really good.   The menus must have changed since other reviewers visited, because there was no Arabic on the menu. Everything is in English. I had the falafel plate and my companion had the lamb shank and rice. Both meals came with a wonderful lentil soup that I have had at Fattoush many times- but this one was so much better. The falafel plate came with falafel of course, a questionable salad, pita that looked homemade, and some of the tastiest hummus i've ever had. It was a huge amount of food, but it was so good that I was compelled to order an extra side of hummus to go with the leftovers. The lamb was apparently very tasty also- i'm not much of a lamb fan, so I didn't try it. The accompanying rice was very tasty though- very complex with many different flavors, but none of them were overwhelming.   At 7.99 for the falafel and 9.99 for the lamb plate, the prices are more than reasonable, especially when you consider that each entree can easily end up being two meals.   I admit that I am partial to Middle-Eastern food and rarely meet a falafel that I dislike, but this was definitely one of the better examples of the cuisine in the metro Phoenix area. I will definitely be back, and maybe next time i'll try the chicken.

Based on the reviews of other yelpers, I decided to check this place out.   Bakeries seem to be a trendy thing these days, popping up all over the place. Most of it is from the whole cupcake craze, and yes, I am part of the problem.   That said, you can probably guess why I went to Sweet Pea in the first place (hint, it wasn't the salad) and I was not disappointed! Some woman had just about bought the place out before I got there, so I had two choices: lemon lime or brownie.   What's a girl to do when faced with such a hard decision? Buy them both, of course, and they were both delicious.   If you're a cupcake fiend, or just have a sweet tooth, check out Sweet Pea. Your waistline may not thank you for it, but your tastebuds certainly will.

When I saw the Nile cafe, I got a little giddy because I always imagined an adorable little cafe in one of those precious live/work units lining Roosevelt. (Tammie Coe doesn't count. No sitting room inside!)    I stopped in for lunch today. Now, take this review with a grain of salt because I a) only ordered one thing and b) I got it to-go.   There are 4 or 5 tables in the dining area, with not much breathing room in between. The server/cashier seemed tired and wasn't too friendly. He seemed annoyed that I asked for a take-out order.   The menu is really limited, and strange. Not offering a traditional sampler plate with goodies like hummus, dolmas, and falafel gets them an immediate thumbs down.  I got the chicken shawarma sandwich. At $7.95, I expected it to be a little more substantial. It was all chicken, and the chicken was pretty dry.  There was quite a bit of nasty yellow lettuce that got picked off, but there were pickles and maybe a few tomato chunks in there somewhere. I think I tasted one. The pita bread was a little rubbery- like it was warmed in the microwave. No bueno.   I know, I know, I shouldn't be whining about a chicken sandwich having too much chicken. Balance is important though, and this sandwich had nowhere near enough complementary flavors to make it a winner.   Sub par sandwich aside, I will give the Nile cafe another try and edit accordingly. I don't feel like I gave it a fair shake with a sandwich to go.

I'm a little late to the party....I finally got around to checking out the new and improved Chez Nous last weekend. This is sad because the new location is within walking distance of my humble abode.   Anyway, the place looks fantastic. I love that it has the same vibe, the same house band,  the same goofy rock sculpture (WTF is that?) and the wallpaper. LOVE the wallpaper.   I also love that the bathrooms are nice and clean, but really- no one goes to a bar for the bathroom.  The bartenders make a mean dirty martini and they don't get pissy with you when you order more than one. (Take note, Bikini Lounge!)

I love breakfast. It's my favorite meal of the day, so I am always excited when a new AM spot opens up.  Well.  After reading all of the wonderful reviews of this place, I had high expectations. I suppose that was my mistake.   I love the fact that this place is in an old Taco Bell. The transformation from cheesy fast food joint to civilized restaurant was well executed and turned out really cute. I love the outdoor seating with the patio heaters.   But....when I end up paying almost $15 for breakfast, I expect a little more than what I got at Over Easy. I ordered the Over Easy, a side of hash browns (because breakfast just isn't complete without potatoes!) and coffee. The Over Easy was very tasty. The spinach, egg and bacon sauce were perfect toppings for the toasted Brioche.  I wasn't disappointed with the taste of the Over Easy, but I don't think that it alone was worth $9. It needs something- like potatoes- on the side.   About that side of hash browns- they were dry and required liberal salt and pepper. Pretty disappointing, especially since the saucer sized side dish was $3. (not even kidding about the saucer.)   The coffee was good. If I lived nearby, I might drop in only for the coffee.  This place doesn't live up to the hype. I won't be back, especially since there are much tastier options closer to home.

Good God, this place is horrible.   I visited this "establishment" (and I use that term loosely) last night for a friend's birthday. The desperation in the air was so thick that it choked out the oxygen. If you want to see a bunch of insecure, badly dressed college girls with no rhythm shaking their asses, this is the place for you.   Maybe I am unfairly biased, having had bad experiences at the Flagstaff location, but I really tried to go into this one with an open mind. Our server acted like we were inconveniencing her and I don't think she smiled once the whole night. $4.50 for a Tecate and a $9 martini (well vodka, people! Not even the good stuff!) later, I left there rather annoyed, but at least I could breathe again.  Bottom line- skip San Felipes. It isn't worth your time or money.

Dear Breadfruit,   We became acquainted on the internet, like so many relationships these days do, and I must admit that I became fascinated with you quickly. Your menu sang to me with so many tasty words, and your location couldn't be better.   We finally met last night, and I am disappointed. While you have a very cheery atmosphere and wonderful staff, your food just didn't woo me at all. The fish was overcooked- burned on the ends,even- and left me unsatisfied. The slaw looked promising, but proved to be nearly impossible to eat. (you try picking up long strings of cabbage and bean sprouts. Just see what happens.) And the breadstick? Oy. The taste of it was fantastic, but it was so overdone that I thought for a second that I might have to send you a dentist's bill if I finished it.   My dining companion was enamored with your curry tofu. Sadly, the one bite of his tofu ended up being the highlight of my meal. Sigh.   I wish that things had turned out better, Breadfruit, because I really wanted to like you. But, when visiting you leaves me hungry for the hole in the wall Caribbean place on Camelback and 35th Ave, I know that it just isn't going to work out.   Good luck to you.   PS...did a midget design your bathroom? I had no idea they even made sinks that small.

Last night, the plan was to hit up Pizzeria Bianco. That plan didn't work out, and we ended up at Stacy's. I have never been so glad to have plans not work out.   The place is teeny tiny, but you can smell the meat the minute you get out of the car and that is enough to know that you made the right decision to come here.   The menu is pretty extensive for such a small place, with several meat selections, a laundry list of sides, and oddball drinks you haven't seen in awhile, like Orange Crush and grape koolaid. Everything is ala carte and cheap. We had a hard time deciding what to get because everything just sounded and looked so good. Since there were only two of us, we settled on splitting a BBQ chicken sandwich, two pieces of fried chicken, greens, BBQ beans and cheddar biscuits. Everything was so great, I could have easily been happy with just one of those items. The biscuits were okay, but I didn't expect them to be sweet.   If you like BBQ and good southern comfort food, you'll love Stacy's. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!

I paid another visit to Stacy's last weekend, and I just have to say...if this place were any better, I think i'd have to move in.   We tried a couple more items this time- spicy BBQ on the chicken sandwich, mashed taters and gravy, fried okra, and mac n cheese.   The spicy BBQ isn't really spicy, but it has more flavor than the regular sauce.   The mashed taters and gravy were awesome- no boxed potato flakes here. The skins are still on, and the gravy is perfectly seasoned.   The fried okra was so good that I could probably be convinced to eat anything Stacy put in front of me. I hate okra. Ok, I thought I hated okra.   The mac n cheese is to die for, but only if you aren't watching your girlish figure. (or mannish, whatever) There's a ton of butter in this, and it's probably the best mac n cheese i've ever had.   I always leave Stacy's feeling a little giddy because the food is so good. It isn't quick, but it's totally worth it.

A friend of mine tipped me off to this place and being a soup- lover, I had to try it.   The selection is minimal- 3 soups per day at the moment. Today's selection was chilled zucchini, real chicken noodle, and Caribbean black bean. I opted for the black bean, and I was not disappointed.   The beans were perfect- not mushy like some bean soups can be. The flavors were all very distinct but blended together perfectly. Yum.   The soups come in different sizes, with an 8 oz. bowl for $5.25. (that would be the small size) Saltines, lavosh or bread (from Simply Bread) with olive oil or butter come on the side. Everything is organic, and extremely fresh. No cans here.   Beverage options include a few different bottled waters, a selection of hot or iced teas, and seasonal smoothies. A BYOB liquor license is in the works.   The dining area is sparse, with three tables, but it seemed like quite a bit of business was done for take-out orders. As an FYI- they take orders for soup pick-up, and will even arrange to be there if you want to come after work. Pretty cool, considering they're currently open from 10-2.   I would love to see a bigger selection of soup, but the place is only a few weeks old and the owner assures me that there is much more to come. I can't wait to find out what it is.

What a strange experience.   My sister and I trekked over here for lunch one day, after she had heard good things about it. I wish they had been true.   The place looks like bar. It is a bar, but I expected it to be a little more cozy considering the emphasis they place on the food. Ah well.   We ordered a fried chicken sandwich, a fried green tomato sandwich, and tater tots to share. The sandwiches came out with nothing but the cheese on them- no lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard, etc.- and we reread the menu thinking that we had misinterpreted what a sandwich consisted of here. We were right- the usual sandwich ingredients had been left off. The tater tots were good, but it would take special talent to screw those up.  The server/bartender didn't bother coming back to check on us until we were just about done eating the mediocre food. When he did, I mentioned that the sandwiches were lacking the lettuce and tomato, and he called the cook out. The cook, who looked about 17 and stoned, seemed shocked that he could have forgotten to finish the sandwiches, and asked if we wanted some lettuce. We told him thanks but no thanks, considering we were finished eating. He insisted, offering to bring us a bowl of lettuce. WTF?   The server was nice enough to offer a small discount for the mess-up, but it was all a bit strange and I don't think I'll be going back.

One word can sum up my experience at Maizie's- Unremarkable.   The restaurant is a cute place, and I really wanted to like it.   The service was slow. Our server would disappear for long periods of time, leaving us with empty glasses, and we watched as other tables got their food, even though we had ordered before them. I am not sure what is so difficult about making a sandwich, but clearly there was some rocket science type stuff going on back there that caused a 25 minute wait for the food.  I had the veggie burger with fries, and my sister had a salad with ancho orange dressing and a cup of potato soup.   I didn't try the salad, but the dressing was described to me as "tinted mayonnaise with no flavor". The thick and chunky potato soup got a better response- it was actually really good.   About the veggie burger...kudos to Maizie's for making them in-house, but for crying out loud- could you give them some flavor, please? I now understand why the burger is served with apricot tzatziki and red onion marmalade- without them, the burger is tasteless. Ah well, the fries were good.   One more nit picky thing that drives me crazy about this place- spelling errors on the menu. Seriously, there isn't a computer today that doesn't come with some form of spell check. Use it.   I doubt I will be back to Maizie's. Nothing about the visit thrilled me.

A fellow yelper told me about this place, and I finally made it there a week or so ago. Since then, I can't seem to stay away- Sunday's venture was the third time in two weeks. What can I say? I like it.   It's cheap, it's tasty, and it's fresh. No, you won't find the best middle eastern food in the world at Al-Hana, but you can't go wrong with a $3.99 chicken shwarma sandwich.   The baba ghanoush is perfectly smoky, the hummus is ok. The chicken shwarma sandwich was really good, the falafel- not so much.   Try the spinach pies. Maybe spinach isn't the first ingredient you'd like to find in a pie, but these will change your mind.   Don't bother coming here if you're looking for a fancy sit down meal. It's completely no-frills, but completely tasty.   One great thing to know about this place: They open at 9 am every day. Taboulleh for breakfast? Sure, why not?

WTF is a "batista"? Paul?   I was never a big fan of the original Willow House, so I was pretty excited to see them remodel the building. The remodel is gorgeous, and the bathroom is no longer alone or scary!   This place is definitely catering to the Willo/Roosevelt upscale crowd, and honestly it's a little too nice for me to want to hang out there on a regular basis. It just doesn't feel like someplace I can completely relax.  The espresso was ok- not the best i've ever had, but definitely not the worst. The lemon cake was tasty, but I get the impression that the desserts are not made on site.   The food menu looks good, and the chef assured me that the soup was made fresh every day. Maybe i'll try it for lunch sometime, but I won't be in any hurry to do so. $7.95 for a sandwich with no side better be something special.

You know how sometimes you just have a perfect meal? One that you wouldn't change any part of, and that leaves you with a goofy little satisfied grin?   I just had one of those. Thanks, Chef Chu.   The atmosphere of the place is very sleek without being uppity. It's a little dark, so if you have trouble seeing in low light, be warned. It's a comfortable spot, but I imagine that it gets pretty packed on the weekends.   The drink menu is overwhelming- multiple pages each of sake, vodkas, martinis, and a small wine list. I don't know enough about sake to know what the heck anything is, but I do know a good martini when I see one. The Pink Ginger was the perfect blend of cranberry, ginger infused vodka, muddled ginger, and lime. It wasn't  nearly as sweet as it sounds, and it went down almost too easily. Watching Tim order the Spicy Mama with a straight face was amusing, but unfortunately the Thai chili infused vodka lacked the burn he was going for.   We ordered Citron Tofu, Red Curry Chicken wings, ginger fish, Thai basil clams, and the sugar cane pork.   Tofu- 5 stars. One of my favorite things about Chu's previous restaurant, Fate, was the tofu. He does it right and like no one else.   Curry chicken wings- 5 stars. I love Thai curry, and these were a great interpretation of an American favorite. Yum.   Ginger Fish- I'd give this one ten stars if I could. It was by far my favorite part of the meal. The fish was cooked to perfection, and the dipping sauce was full of flavor and the perfect amount of spice. I have no idea what was in the sauce, but I loved it.   Clams- I didn't like the clams at all, but Tim thought they were brilliant. Having never had clams before, I was put off more by the gritty texture than the taste. The broth that they clams are served in is quite tasty with a pleasant burn.   Sugar Cane pork- 4 stars. Ground pork wrapped around sugar cane, deep fried, and served with a pineapple ginger sauce. Tasty, but quite rich. I think I'd only order this one again if there were more than two people sharing it, because one piece is enough. (An order is 4 pieces)   All in all, a great meal. Sens definitely isn't an every day eat-out spot, as it can get expensive pretty fast, but it's one for regular rotation.

My sister and I ended up here after First Friday last night, and I was surprised to find that the place wasn't packed like every other bar down town. One sip of my drink, however, and it all made sense.   Hanny's is a beautiful example of adaptive reuse and historic rehabilitation, but I think they went overboard with the modern decor. It feels cold and rather uninviting.   We were only there for drinks, which were reasonably priced but not so great. My sister's Pear-tini tasted like Nyquil, and my Ginger Creek was all whiskey and no ginger. We figured we just ordered the wrong things, so we went for dirty martinis for the second round. Priced at $5, it seems like a pretty good deal. However, I get better martinis at the Bikini, and that's with really crappy vodka and a pissed off bartender.  We had a good time exploring the place- the elevator shaft, the crazy bathrooms, the little make-out corner upstairs- but in the end, we both agreed that we should have gone to SideBar.   Lesson learned.

What a cute little place!   I've been waiting for a long time for Side Bar to open, and it was worth the wait. It's a tiny space that fills up quickly, but it's very chic without being pretentious. The wine list is good, with a nice variety, but the pours are pretty chintzy. The beer selection is decent too, but I think $5 is a bit high for beers as commonplace as Newcastle. They also have a full bar with a better selection than most bars- lots of whiskey and flavored vodka that you won't find in many bars.   SideBar is a great place to go with a couple of friends for drinks and conversation. The atmosphere is comfy, the staff is nice, and the drinks are good. What more could you ask for?

On a recent breakfast outing, we ventured up 7th Avenue to try the recently opened Two Hippies Breakfast Joint. The concept is the newest of the Two Hippies ventures, which seem to be popping up all over midtown. Breakfast offerings include standards like French toast and waffles, a coconut-crusted hot jam sandwich, and breakfast bowls. Lunch selections include burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, and salads. Also available are vegan smoothies, an array of flavored lemonades, and the ever present soda fountain.    The breakfast bowl sounds pretty impressive- 3 eggs scrambled with a choice of 6 toppings selected from an extensive list of cheeses, veggies, sauces, and meats- but fell short of expectations. Three of us ordered the bowls, which come with Texas Toast and hash browns, and none of us were impressed. Sure, the scrambled egg mess was tasty, but the potatoes were bland, cubed, and definitely not hash browns. In short, the bowl is nothing special and it could have been done better at home.    Two Hippies do a few things right- the prices, the flavored lemonades, the waffle, and the mere existence of fried pickles on the menu. Unfortunately, there are so many more things that they need to improve here. The menu clearly states that lunch is served all day, but a request for lunch items was refused. All orders are packaged in to-go boxes, which is extremely wasteful. The dining area is so cluttered that it borders on claustrophobic. No credit/debit cards are accepted. Maybe they are still working out the kinks, which would explain things like messing up my order and taking ten minutes to find a knife for a customer.    The verdict? Two Hippies should have stuck with burgers and tacos. Breakfast is just not their forte.

As Tim J. said, Zach did a product photo shoot for our bakery. Everything went great- he is professional and talented. The images turned out so great that i'm thinking about framing some of them. Seriously.   If you're looking for an excellent photographer, look no further than MelonFish Photo. You will not be disappointed.
