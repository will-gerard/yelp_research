This place has been open for 50 something years. Now i know why its still open. Haha. Man oh man oh mannnnn. Boy was i wrong about this place. My friend took me,  after bragging about it for months, I just have to goooo. So..... we had the delicious fried zucchini, to veggie pizza, lastly to the baked pasta.  Everything was on point!!!! Okay, I know the fried zucchini is really bad for you, but what can you say. Yolo!!!!!! Lolz. It was mouth watering. Even the ranch was rich. The vegetarian pizza was amazing, I loved everything about it. The crust was crispy and thick. The marinara sauce was sweet and it was just perfect. Bell peppers,  onions, mushrooms and olives. ( of course I had to pick the olives ) :))  The service was wonderful, great atmosphere. Cute little homey place. I like it.  I shalllllll come back.

Ahhhhh red pull over sweater!!!!!  I knew target wouldn't do me wrong, Griselda. Did such an amazing job helping me find a red pullover no pockets no zipper no hoodie for me!!!!! I went to literally seven different targets and today was my day, I am sooo happy!!!  I got a medium just in case. So I would go to a different target and get a smaller size. Fingers crossed.

My sister got Chorizo, she took one bite and automatically she made a face, it was way too salty!! Being the nice person she is. She tried to cover it up with ketchup, that was still a horrible taste. So the waiter came and took it away. Didn't even bother for a new order or ask if she wanted anything else.  Strawberries banana pancake. Is what my nephew got. I told him to put the banana on a separate plate because I am allergic.( we're sharing). 15 minutes later, his pancakes came out. No bananas in sight.. We ask him four times that were missing a plate of bananas. Yet. No bananas. I was annoyed because my nephew didn't want to eat, so I got up myself and ask the people in the back to give me a bananas. And when they did, the banana was bruised!!!  I ordered the vegetarian omlette, it was volcano on with massive cheese. When I eating eggs? Or cheese? cheese! I just took off the cheese and try to eat what I have on my plate.. it was bad. All bad. :/  Overall, the food was horrible,  I still paid for it, andd TIPPED. This was just a horrible experience.

First timer, never again. Our waiter speak no English whatsoever. She kept nodding yes to everything I said. I told her I was a vegetarian so no meat, only vegetables substitution,  And the only thing she repeated back was no meat!  My appetizer came, all that was in my sushi was avocado and cream cheese.....  yeah. Smh. Also, i ordered the udon vegetable. I noticed it was taking a very long time to come out. So I ask the waiter, she said ten minutes....  fifteen minutes passed by, I ask another waiter about my entree, she said the vegetable udon was never ordered.   I had to get up several times for napkins, wasabi, hot water and the bill..  So there you have it!

I think our waiter was sick or something. Or he just hate his job.. the visit here was bad here. There were no hostess, I had to direct myself to a table. Took 15 minutes to get water and the menu.  We ordered the nachos VEGETARIAN of course. Oh dear buddha. It was heaven. All it was missing was salsa or hot sauce. The server took so long to come so I had to get up and help myself to get some. I had to get up to get napkins, and get up to ask for more water..  Pretty much I had a horrible experience.

Bread bread breaddddddd. Do not eat the whole basket. Haha when my entrée came out I was so full!!!!!!! Guilty.  I love this place. It's like a good feel of Italy when you're sitting there admiring the art work and decor. The people here is very generous and accommodating.  IF YOU'RE A YELPER, CHECK IN. YOU GET A COMPLIMENTARY WINGS AND ONION RINGS! whoooo score. :D I always get the vegetarian pizza with jalapeños, spinach, mushrooms and bell peppers. DELICIOUS. Love the thin crust to it. 5 STARS for meeeee!!!!

I haven't been to this location in a very long time, and when I did today. I came to a brand new restaurant. Everything changed, idk how I feel about it. Its in the hood ghetto area, then all of a sudden you walk in, its like the location in Scottsdale.  Eehhhh. I like the old restaurant layout better.. and whatttttt? Valet parking? Yesss they did. They upgrade it.  Best customer service.  They constantly refilled my drink,  so I was never parched :)))  I was bummed that my waffles was soft and crispy. .  :/ my mac and cheese was delish!

You can't go wrong at this place. Best Chinese food here, before I was a vegetarian.  you come here, you're obligated to see someone you know and their grandmas. Haha.  When there's a long wait, we go next door to the nail supply. lolz . To kill time.  Fried tofu is the bestttt

I wasn't sure if I was going to like this place or not. Just because it looked like it was some kind of hole in the wall, to be honest. But it was really good. I had the vegetarian pizza. With no olives. Very fresh. I liked it.

I haven't been here in forever. Recently came for my friend birthday dinner. We sat on the patio, it was so nice out. Love the Christmas lighting and it also had a water fountain, super cuteee. Love the ambiance.  The waiter was very patient when it came to me, I'm a vegetarian so I had ask 100 questions. Haha i end up making my own nachos. Fresh chips, black beans, pico de gallo, lettuce, jalapeños and vegetables, and Salsa on the side. It was phenomenal. It was such a big portion.  Glad I shared my entrée with a friend.

Alright.  Ready for my two cents?  My client told me about this place not to long ago.  She knows how I am about pizza ;)) well anyways.  I came across a Groupon for it. I was ecstatic!!!!!!!!  My boyfriend and I went for date night. Right when we walked in, we got sat down right away. BUT 15 minutes later,  our waiter was no where to be found nor knew who was our waiter. I had to ask who our waiter was. One, she didn't speak English nor I can comprehend. Two, she kept smiling at me when I was talking to her,  she didn't listen to what I say.  honestly, whenever I had a question or command something,  I had to ask TWICE!!! Smh.  These couple came in 30 minutes after us, THEY GOT THEIR FOOD BEFORE US. I confronted the manager, he did not care, he said don't worry.  It'll come out.. wtf are you serious?     And, Whatttt? No hot sauce or ranch? Yeah. I was bummed out.  Overall. Horrible customer service. But I love my pizza .

We had one scoop of peppermint and one scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream.. heaven in my mouth   you just can't go wrong with chocolate chip. Yummmm my favorite.  The peppermint was too sweet for me. So I had my boyfriend kill it. Haha.  I love this place.

My boyfriend and I came here for a special occasion. He had gotten a promotion at his new job within 3 weeks of working there..Amazing right?! Oh, Which he had no idea where i was taking him, nor had a surprise for him.. We got lost on the way there. Because of the the constructions. I was sooo lost, thinking this hotel should not be in a neighborhood area, haha but it was.  Just keep driving.  :)  We had the three course meal. Everything was a la carte.   I had the Hermosa salad. I love the fruity sauce that was in the salad. also the mash potato was very creamy and boy do I want some more. Boyfriend had steak, or did he had pork? I forgot.. he absolutely loved it.  The dessert came out, I had called in advance and specifically told them to keep the dessert part a surprise. They did a wonderful job. They even came out with a congratulation card, and the staff signed it. So personal, yet what a kind gesture that was.  I'll be back here again. Thank you Hermosa staff!!

This place is small yet comfortable for my nephew and I. Felt like we were at home watching the suns game and eating pizza.  The owner was so nice. I had asked him politely if she could put on this end game, instead. She handed me the remote control like I was family. Haha. She said whatever you need let me know.  Thumbs up.  I ordered the ziti mushroom pasta, Holy cow they put way too much sauce in!!! Which was PERFECT!!! :)) it also came with a house salad and breadsticks. If I knew, I wouldn't have ordered the vegetarian pizza. But either way, the pizza was fantastic :) minus rhe olives. .. ( I said no olives) :/   We'll be coming back. :))

Sweets to wine, shirts, frames and candies. :D which by the way, the red velvet ice cream is heaven!   So. My entrée. The ROCKET MAN pizza is to die for. Actually all their vegetarian pizza is to die for!! yummmmmm. And their CRUST. Really? !?!?! Freaking phenomenal!! Crispy, yet soft to bite off and so tasteful. Oh. And don't forget the hot sauce. You can't eat pizza without hot sauce!!! Sigh. Can I just live here??? Or have this right next to my house. Haha.  I'm always back!!!

Chips and salsa!!!!!! I'll take it. I'll have it all day long. Breakfast lunch and dinner. I'm all in. :D their chips are so fresh, hot and crunchy. Never stale!! It's just amazing. Literally!   I got the vegetarian chimichanga with rice on the side. Inside my chimichanga has yellow squash, bell peppers and onions. I eat half of the veggie chimichanga, boom I'm full. For a large plate like that is inexpensive yet filling and satisfying.   I'm always back!

Everyone tells me all the time that this is the best Mexican food in town and I have to try it because it's delicious and all the above. So, I did. Everything just went wrong from the moment I walked in. It started off with my beverage. It took forever to come. Ordering our entree was long. So i ordered a vegetarian burrito. Not what I ordered. I'm a vegetarian, And it had MEAT in it. I was really upset. Good thing I pick the hell out of it. And the girl told me that it was happy hour and she suggested the margarita on the rocks. And I did. She said it was cheaper and bigger. Of course you pick that right? But of course it wasn't. She didn't seem like she wanted to work there.  So much for the hype that people were talking about!

Wasn't hard to find at all, my boyfriend found it quickly. Love the whole atmosphere.  The lighting and all that was romantic.  Super cute.    I got the vegetarian tostadas. Ehhhhh. It was just like salsa and dip basically.  Spicy, which I love. But still.. ehhh.. lolz.  I was so bummed though. :( because my boyfriend ordered the fuego pasta, with chicken on the side (so we can share because im a vegetarian. And the waiter knows that. )  the food came looking super delicious, as I was going to take a bite. There was sausages in it.............. um okay. The waiter didn't say anything about sausages in it knowing we were going to share.  :( booo.    The bill came out. It was $35.74. I had a Groupon, so end up paying $5.74. :D I just left a $20.   Other than that. My boyfriend like his pasta.  Lolz.

TWO thumbs up! the veggies were crunchy and the omelette was cooked perfectly. It comes with two pancakes, it was so soft, warm and tasteful, no butter on it of course. My mom is a huge fan of their corn beef hashbrown. She brags about it all the time. Haha :D  The customer service here is wonderful. Never had a problem since I've gone here.

Yummmm. now that they move it to 39th and happy valley with a DRIVE THRU its so hard to go there. The line is so long and same goes to the drive thru.  When they first open i went in and they recognized me right away and remember my drink instantly. Great costumer service and great drinks :)

I give 5 stars on the pizzas, but THREE STARS on the service. I waited 15 minutes to be greeted and to get my order... Her having a conversation with her co workers being drunk last night was more important I guess.lolz  Anyways.  The Moroccan pizza with the best pizza I've ever had, who knew to put pine nuts on your pizza:)) The mushroom and cheese pizza was mediocre. But it was still good, we sat in the pink spot side. Which was the ice cream shop. Super cute, love the environment. I love all the books :))  I end up getting the cappuccino crunch ice cream. It was magnificent. I shall come back for that!

They had a cute patio, too bad it's too cold to be sitting outside.  When my boyfriend and I walked in, we got confused. No one came to us, greeted us or anything. We had to walk into another room, then they sat us down.  Omgggg chip and salsa is sooo yummmmyyy. We had to ask dor seconds. Lolz   I had the vegetarian chimichanga dinner, it was very crispy and delicious, the texture was just right. The bean though, was amazing. Something about the beans was really good. :)))  Steak fritanga ;; he said " i loveed, it was so muchhh food.I am full."  I shall return

First time here, i was really excited for the experience..... but fail.  I came here for a birthday party. Party of 9. Everybody was there on time and of course 15 minutes late even though we had a reservation...  It took 20 minutes to get our drinks. Another 20 minutes to get my two order of sushi. I had to get up and ask for hot water and low sodium soy sauce. The server didn't seem to care for her job really. She took her time for everything.  Conner.. he was a great chef! Showing his skills at the table and entertaining us with his jokes. He was phenomenal!!!

I always passed by this place and never thought it will interest me until my sister wanted to come here. I like how all the decor is forest like. :)   Came in, and got seated right away!   I got the thick french toast. Not my favorite choice. Bummed.  We spilt our meals. :)  Sissy had The California benedict. It was absolutely amazing. I think this was the first time ever that my biscuit was crispy!!!!! It was perfect. Andddd the hash browns? Whooo, don't get me started on that. The potatoe was cut thick, not thin and all mashed up like other places.  It was well cooked, crisp and was delightful.  Best hash browns everrr!!!! Especially with the black bear diner original pepper sauce baby burn with ketchup was yummmyyyy.   I AM ONE HAPPY GIRL. I WOULD BE HAPPIER IF MY FRENCH TOAST WAS GOOD. BOOO.. so.... four stars.  ALL THIS DELICIOUSNESS WAS ALL UNDER 20 BUCKS!!!!!

I seriously had no what to order when I came here. My friend and I just stared at the menu for the longest time!! Haha. Of course at the vegetarian menu. Great selection, so much to choose from. Just didn't know what to order. So I LITERALLY close my eyes and pointed to one. I got the chili vegetables. And the palak paneer. And....I forgot the other name of the dish. But oh my gosh. I love all my dishes. Different texture for sure, not use to it. But i like it. :D The staff was great, slow with our drinks, but overall it was a good place for dinner.

I ordered the bianca with mushroom. It was phenomenal!!!! The crust to the cheese and the mushroom yummmmm. They didn't give me much basil on my pizza, but I still love it. Lolz.  Nephew ordered rhe Italian stallion, which has I believe pepperoni sausage and cheese. He was impressed for a ten year old :) he loved it so much,  he wants to come back next week.. haha.

I loved how I walked in, it was like a mall. They had everything.  Clothes to shoes, and to candies and other junk. I love it all.   I got the Mamas breakfast I believe. I shared with my boyfriends daughter. She loved the sausage and bacon, then again, she's five. She loves everything.  Lolz. the pancakes was so good. They even had their own syrup little bottle, super cute.   Boyfriend got the french toast. Ehhh. Not my thang. Too bland for me. Im picky about my french toast. So that was a negative.   I didn't like how we had to pay up front, it was kind of confusing. . People can easily walk out. Smh. Didn't like that whole concept.   Yes, I'll come backk :)

Great food, great drinks,  great company.  Perfect night out in the patio with the bestie  Mediterranean plate was outstanding.  The hummus was delicious. And the babganouch?!?!?!?! It was heaven!!!!!!  The truffled mushroom pizza was alright.  I thought it can be better. Shrugs. The crust though.. I killed the crust. Haha :))  My drink, orange blossom martini. Ehhhh, it was decent. After 3 or 4 sips, it got boring to me.  Overerall, the place is nice, the food was good.  I'll come back just for the Mediterranean plate :))

GARDEIN WINGS!!!!!!! the Thai pizza, the noodles, just the whole gardien section is amazing. It's crazy how the wings look like it's actually buffalo wings. But it's not.   gardein is a chicken or beef substitute made from soy, wheat, pea proteins, vegetables and ancient grains. Yard House offers a variety of menu selections made with gardein that do not contain meat, fish, poultry, shellfish or product derived from these sources, but may contain dairy or eggs.. this is not a vegan friendly environment. Sorry mina.

This place is such a fun and relaxing atmosphere,  and of course to get your artsy on :D feeling Like a kid again. I love it here.  As you wish can be a date night, a all girls night out and of course to bring your kids ( my nephews)  or just to come because you want to feel young again and want to whip up something neat ^___________^;;  I always had good customer service here. The girls come to our table and make sure we are doing okay, they'll give me examples and ideas for my project. Very helpful :)

Literally speechless. I absolutely love this place. The ambiance, the decor, the customer service and the FOOD. Geez. Two thumbs up.  Very shabby chic, lanterns candles everywhere. If you're not sitting in a patio, you're definitely missing out.. each table had a white cloth, candle lit and a rose in a vase.  My boyfriend and I had a four-course meal here of course and it was just wonderful. I love how the menu said " vegetarian option available " score!!!!!! $$$$$  Our first course was the roasted cauliflower. Oh wowwww. So creamy and so tasteful.  Second course was the spring salad. Best salad I had ever had actually.  Third course was the gnocchi for me and the lollipop lamb chop for the bf. He said it was heavenly. The gnocchi was a bit chewy, but the sauce was delicious.  Fourth course was the polenta lasagna and the rosary filet mignon. I absolutely loved my lasagna. I would have finsihed it but I was so full from all the food I had prior to my entrée. The mushrooms was delightful. Ummm I can tell he loved his filet mignon......... cause his face expression said it all. Hahaha.  I'LL BE BACK.  Yesss. Take me backkkkkkk

My nephew had a heart attack when he found out what he was eating wasn't meat. Lolz. I told my sister not to say anything. Watching him eat was simply joy. Hehe. So........ when I told him. He was like "whatttttttttttt? What is soy auntie". Haha. :) need the less to say, he killed his bbq chicken with white rice. Yummm. He said he wants to come back and try the hot dog. Haha kids.  The sauce to the spring roll was delicious!!!! I'll have that again. Oh, and their chicken nuggets too. Yummmmm.  Those are my faveee. I always get that.  I must rave about the spicy tofu pad thai. Omg. It was just beautiful.  Heaven in your mouth,  :))) I love how lemony and spicy it was    I WILL COME BACKKKK!!!!!

Came into the store with no help. Had to search for employees. Had to find my own way for the Phoenix Suns gear... Finally when I flag down a employee for help, she told me there was only one rack for the Phoenix Suns mens gear.no old school nor new jerseys.. We live in Arizona. Phoenix Suns is our team... Shouldn't we have a whole wall of Phoenix Suns gear? Even if I was to buy a t-shirt there. They didn't have the size I want. All they had was large and extra large... Pretty disappointed.

Gosh, this pizza place is so good. Great patio, great atmosphere, BUT........... omg. Horrible customer service. We waited 25 minutes for our food come out. I needed napkins and a extra plate, i had to go get it myself because the waitress was no where to be found, I had to ask a different waitress for hot sauce.. I don't know.  It was a mess..   Butttt on the brighter note. I had the margheritta pizza, yummmmmm. Heaven.  Honestly, I'll just go in next time, take it to go so I don't have to do deal with rhe employees.  :/

Idk how I feel about this area,  pretty scary. :/  First timer here!!! Ryan with the beard is so friendly, funny and full of energy.  I like him :))  and very helpful since I was so indecisive on my vegetarian subs. I end up getting the griefo, that's what Ryan suggested.  It was good. He put too much mayonnaise in it. But other than that, it was good.  Geez. The gooo balls, the chocolate chip cookies and the rice Krispy treat..... sooo good. Yet so freakin bad for you.  Haha.  so... people watching was interesting.  Haha I felt like I was in high school all over again. Every single person who walked in was literally stoned!! Haha. Smh. Funnnyyyy.  I like the bob Marley posters :))  I shall be coming back.  :))

I loveee it. My waitress was cute and so outgoing. You can tell she love what shes doing.  I had all their vegetarian dish here. My favorite one has to be the tofu tacos. Their sauce is so yummy and the black beans is on point.  :)

Ohh yea. Im a sucka for chip and salsas. Yummmm. I kept going back for more chips. Hehe :)  this place is just any other mexican restaurant. But if course I came during lunch time, not after the club after 3am for the munchies. Haha. THE BEAN and RICE was so tasty.  Idk what and how they cook their rice, but it has some kind of sweet pure taste to it. I don't even care. I like it :))

This Thai restaurant is so good! Unfortunately there are not many vegetarian options but the lemongrass Tom yum hot pot can be made vegetarian and it was delicious. I know it was silly of me to tell them to go easy on the lemongrass. Haha.  Apparently this is my boyfriend's favorite Thai restaurant. He loves getting the hot pot and they can make it extra spicy. He also enjoys the Thai tea and desserts there. But his favorite is being able to see his car while he eats lol....literally parked right in front. And our table is right there. Haha

My friend took me here. It's vegan and organic. The food here is phenomenal. We came for brunch, You can't go wrong with any entrée you get really. The pancakes here are so fluffy and so filling. Make sure you share, it's big. Oh and the Chilliquiles. Omg. It was AMAZING. Blue chips, beans, tofu and HOT SAUCE ON TOP. oh yessss. I wouldn't mind eating this for breakfast lunch and dinner.   They have great pastries here as well. Kinda sweet for my taste buds but when I do... it's good.  But why is it so farrrr. lol. The 20 min drive is worth it though.

I came to Four seasons to have dinner at Talavera, I had made reservations for my boyfriend and i had to request a special dish for me, being a vegetarian and all. The chef did a phenomenal job.   The sunset was stunning as we ate dinner. It was breathtaking and so was our booth. My boyfriend had a steak and he said it was delicious and was cooked to a medium rare perfection. There was a little order mishap but was quickly and professionally resolved. Dessert we had fruit tart. GET IT. *HAPPY DANCE*  Overall we enjoyed our dinner great customer service. we'll be back and hopefully we stay at the hotel as well.

The ambiance to this place was nice, and can be perfect for a date spot. :)   I met up with a friend of mine. The hostess that lead me to my table, seem like she didn't like her job at all. I didn't get a grin or smile,nothing.  I ordered the vegetarian New Mexico enchiladas.  OHHH MYYYY GOOOODNESSSSSSS. Deliciousness to my mouth. :)))))))) the rice, beans to the enchiladas was perfect!!!! I almost killed that dish. And you know what else was perfect??  My  pomegranate  margarita. Yes.. very friendly drink :D   I'll definitely return again.

How about we gamble and then go upstairs for dinner? Haha. :))  Orange sky is a very warm, classy, and a romantic restaurant to have a date night. We dressed up of course and we looked amazing! :)  I had made a reservation for two next to the window at private booth. I was a disappointed when he sat down in the middle of the restaurant not next to the window and was not private...  Being a vegetarian is a pain, but if course the chef whipped up something... and it was amazing, quinoa, fresh vegetables and the asparagus so tasty and crispy. :) the gnocchi... so chewy and had a weird after taste.. Mister order the steak, he said it was "ehhhh" He said the steak can be more juicy..  Love the patio view. So romantic looking over the city :)

She has a cute room, cute set up with the bed and everything. Very homey and perfect for lashes.   I felt so bad for this poor girl. I kept moving, I'm just an antsy person who can't lay still.

Umm.. here we go. It was a nice restaurant to sit down with the family and enjoy a good meal. The food was great, everything went well.. but our waiter didn't seem too happy about taking our orders or even working. He looked so annoyed and was rushing our orders. When we asked for condiment,  he looked all stressed out. By the way, HE WAS THE ONLY ONE ON THE FLOOR.

NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN!!!!!!   One. My chimichanga was so dry, had literally 8 lettuce on the plate. Id ask for more lettuce,  they wanted to CHARGE me EXTRA! for lettuce?  Really? Where it came with the mealllllll. Then it was suppose to come with avocado and sour cream. Didn't have that either. Once again, I asked. They wanted to charge me. Whatttt? It was suppose to come with it.  Ask for the manager, i talked to her, her name is Jenny. She is the owner, i spoke her about our DISAPPOINTING entrées. She did not care what so ever. She said we messed up the order.  Are you kidding me?  My family and I end up eating our food poorly and very unhappy.  Honestly, if I did not pay for my food already. I would have just left. no lie.. Never ever have I've been treated this way.  horrible customer service,  no accommodations. Very aggravated.   JUST LOST CUSTOMERS!!!!!!! NEVER AGAIN.  Not mexican here!!!!!!

I think this might be the spot. this place is so cute. Love the layout. :))) butttttt... let me start off by saying parking was ridiculous!!! Who has a parking spot that only has 8 spots... Omg. I parked right across the plaza from the gas station. We walked!!!! :(  We started off with the artichoke dip. It was fabulous. It was spot on creamy and hot. The bread with crunchy and it well with the dip. We also had the margherita pizza. Very declious :))  The waiter wasn't very helpful nor seem like he likes his job. I asked for new plates because the plates we have on the table was wet and muggy look. He took forever, so I went and got it myself. This was his response when he saw me get them " thanks for getting them, (shaking his head) " wow.  really?!? Oh there's more. So my girlfriend and I ordered the Creme Brule. He came over and had the torch to caramelized the top of the creme Brule. I said awesome, do you mind if I record this. He said " wow, what is this world come to when you have to instagram everything" seriously?! I just snarled at him.  Seriously,  the food was great, the dessert was delicious.  But this guy must be a joke... riight?!  I'll be back, but not to that kind of service.

Omgggg the french toast is a must. Three thick toast, the walnut was so tasty, it had fresh blueberries and strawberries on it.   It was simply heaven in your mouth. ALSO the veggie omelette was a out of this world,  with fresh fruits and potatoes on the side... Haha not complaining, it was wonderful.   I SHALL COME BACKKK

I heard some good stuff about this place. When you first walk in, it was good ambience. Food was average. My boboyfriend ordered chicken alla vodka and I ordered the Margarita pizza. However, service was horrible. The waitress would walk off as you are talking to her. The first was when I got up to ask for ranch dressing I walked up to her. As I was talking she walked away. The second time was when I asked for a box. But overall,  good food.

Omg, parking was a pain the butt. I parked so far. Smh.   Love all the art work on the wall. The canvas are beautiful.  The atmosphere here is relaxing. Great music of choice :)  They only had one person working. Literally.  She did the ordering, the register up front and the cleaning. She ran around like a headless chicken.   Great vegan menu,  everything sound amazing .i wanted it all. But I had the tofu burrito. It was tasty. The salsa could of been hotter, then the burrito would of been phenomenal :)

Haha Anyways, the prices here are very reasonable and I love how they show the prices of the local competitors. Awesome!! Shows how much I save.  I had coupons that got sent to my house, free oreos, free gallon of milk and free family size cherrios :))) but of course I bought more groceries than I need.   If only Winco wasn't fat for me.. :(

Holy moly, what great popcorn they have here. I think she said there's over 65 or 75 flavored popcorn. You can have any samples you want.  I had the Southwest jalapeno popcorn, the peanut butter popcorn, and the white cheddar cheese popcorn. All three was phenomenal. I mix the Southwest jalapeno and the white cheddar together in a mini sized bag. Even more heaven together!!!!  The girls here are wonderful. So kind and very friendly.. I'll definitely be back. If I'm in the area.

Been here 3 or 4 times already, for dinner and happyyy hour. Whooo.. I love the multi colors wedding look, its so pretty. Very romantic feel...... But then, Trance music comes on. Haha. Get my groove on :)   Hmmm let's see, I got the tofu and vegetable with rice. The rice was kinda soggy. The tofu was good though. My friend got the noodle dish. He said it was mediocre. He said it would be better if they didn't put too much salt. :/

My sister got the mexican benedict. She said it was super hot yet tasty :)   I got the tortilla espanola, ehhhh. The salad was very tangy and has a wierd after taste, it was similar to lasagna really, but other than that my plate was good. :) their house made orange juice was really good. Perfect.  I didn't like the set up how you have to get up and order. I love the fresh sun flowers on the tables :)

Costumer service was slow. Took 15 minutes to get our waitress and 15 minutes for our drinks to come.  South west wrap, my sister like her wrap, but needs a hint of spice, she said.  Banana bread french toast, grandma said it was so sweet. The sauce was drenched when she got it. Definitely no need syrup for these bad boys. She liked her bowl of fruit better.  Veggie Omlette with potatoes. VEGGIE, yeah. No veggies. More of cheese and egg whites. didn't finish it. It was too bland, but tapitio and ketchup made it better.  Haha.. my potato was over cooked and had so much season on it. My whole wheat bread tasted old and stale. Im over all disappointed.. shrugs..

Taiwanese ice babyyy. Everything on point.  Love the decor and the atmosphere here.  Hmmm so I've been here multiple times. They always tend to mess up my order. Lolz, BUTTT they fix it right away, very apologetic and yet accommodating. Overall, great customer service. The owner and his mom is very friendly. She speaks Vietnamese to me all the time. Super cute lady.  I always get the Thai tea boba, and of course the taro shaved ice.. yummmmmm go get your shaved ice now.

The sow was such a wonderful experience,  poor Sean who has to put up with me on my 30 days no pasta, rice or bread lifestyle. Haha. Anddddd top it off I am a vegetarian. Anywho, this place reminds me of the deuce and yardhouse combine. I love it, and an open kitchen. It's great.  I started off with the eggplant frits as an appetizer. Holyyy moly of spongebobbbb. The taste was wonderful,  lightly breaded (cheat day) eggplant dipping it with marinara sauce and a mox with cholula hot sauce.. two thumbs up.  My entrée was the vegetable board minus the beets, and he substituted it with fried tomatoes.  I didn't like that so much. The kale salad was on par and I asked for an extras. Everything else was wonderful.   Ill be coming back :)

I was looking forward to this place for the longest time, i love korean food. So we decided to go for date night. my boyfriend and I walked in and was greeted by two happily elderly ladies.   As my boyfriend was looking through the menu, he was so skeptical of what to get because this was new to him. Well, he didn't like his food of choice. We wanted to see the menu again, but she gave us nasty face as in, your going to oay for that meal right? The lady was very rude and wasn't apologetic at all. Didn't accommodate us or anything.   Only two people worked there.  It was pulling teeth to get them to refill our drinks. It was just horrible.  I don't recommend this place to anyone.  :(

All the red signs here in this plaza look a like, so Nook didn't stand out to me. :/   I absolutely love this place. My waiter was nice but Mr. Tagan was awesome. Anddddd he's the manager.  He was so friendly, funny ( trying to make jokes at me) and very catering :)  I had the Quattro Stagioni, minus the olives and parmesan. Which two slices has spinach and tomatoes, two slices with sautéed mushrooms, two slices with artichoke and two slices with ricotta cheese and mushrooms. I don't know how I felt about the artichoke, it was too tangy for me. The rest was satisfying!  Creamy gorgonzola sauce, and tapitio is a great mix for dipping sauce. Phenomenal!!!!!!  I overall like this place, I shall come back for happy hour! :)

I had great service here! I give this place a five star.  They had messed up on my appointment, I was not on the books at all..yet, they took me in and took care of me, It was 8 o'clock and I had to be at work by 930, and she said she'll get me out of here by 9.  I don't know what she did, got papers, got on her phone.. next thing you know I have my rental car ready, my car was in the shop and ready to get fix :)) it was lovely.

First timers. Everyone is talking about this place. We had to try it.  Absolutely exceptional customer service. Tina was so accommodating and willing to do what made my sister happy.. She had order the Cubano Panino, not realizing that there's massive mustard in the sandwich. Tina took it back with no hesitation,  gave her another sandwich with no mustard., not only that, she also put sweeet potato fries on the side for her on the house!!   I ordered the Grove, vegetarian of course. It was okay. Not bad not good. The sweet potato is really good :)  I drove far for this.. I would come back :)

I had the wild mushroom tacos. It was super tasty, minus the sour cream. I think that was too much. A must. a MUSTTTTT. IS THE GUACAMOLE  It had promegranate, raisins and other fruits in it. It was delicious! Don't knock it until you try it. Oh and the sticky brownie with ice cream is to die for. Oh man. I want to go back now writing this review. Haha.

But what you need to get is the vegetarian eggs benedict, the hash brown was crisp and my eggs was on par!  My sister got fruit pancakes,  she said it was fluffy and very tasteful.  My daddy got the skirt steak eggs. He thought the steak could be more juicier, but other than that, he like his entrée.

As you walked in. It was beautiful. White cloth table, wine glasses set up. I felt like I was meeting up with a hot date. Haha. great bar in the middle of the room. Open kitchen. (Love the back spash).   My clients recommend this place for the longest time and I'm barely trying it out now. She said "I know you love pizza but you have to try the vegetarian torte."  Which was an eggplant and cheese ravioli on the side. Ohhh yessssssss... Two thumbs up! Everything was tasteful. The cheese ravioli was different. As in, I never had this kind of cheese ravioli before. I think it had a hint of mushrooms inside the ravioli I'm not really sure. The eggplant was delicious!!!   I will be back!

I came here with my nephew! Super excited to have lunch. Until something bad happened. I have salad with moving. There was a grasshopper in my salad!!! Yes. You read that right. I freaked out.  I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to scare the customers in the restaurant. So I nonchalantly grabbed the bowl of salad and brought it up to the front. I showed her. She automatically apologize. Took the bowl and gave me a free coupon for my next meal. I don't want a free coupon. I'm appalled... Does this mean they don't wash their salad?

The union is the walk way to these little cute, hippie trendy shops that leads to the forge pizza. I thought it was a great atmosphere and ambiance. I like the patio as well.  I had the Margherita pizza. It was really good. My boyfriend had the hot wings.. He was so disappointed, it was bland and tasteless. :(  the ranch wasn't ranch. It was so run down.. he didn't like it.  The server was so slow. And it wasn't even busy.

Found this place under hot and new! Decided to try it out for lunch. This is a wonderful restaurant. Great staff, great chef and great atmosphere.  You order first. sit down and they'll bring out your food. I ordered the black bean burger on a salad. No bun. And the roasted herb potatoes. My nephew had the macaroni and cheese and the fruit on the side. Also a yellow ticket for dessert later. The food was awesome. The black bean patty came with a mango salsa with it. And jalapenos, it was phenomenal with the herb potatoes on the side. The mac and cheese was cooked perfectly. Not too bland nor too cheesy. I liked it :)   The chef and the waitress (Amanda) came out several times asking how our plate was. He wasn't even the owner. Great customer service and super friendly to my nephew and I !!!!!!!  I shall be back!!! :D

What a great place! I love the atmosphere, I love the ambience, I love everything about this place. This place is just too cute. Very romantic as well, The way the setup is.   And what?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? There's live music playing while eating sushi? The guy on the piano was amazing.  My waiter was so patient with me, of course I had millions of questions about the vegetarian menu, and what was good, what was his recommendation. And what was his favorite. All the above. Etc. Haha.. I ordered the hamatchi popper and the rice crispy rolls.( Of course vegetarian) it was delicious!!!!!! The sauce on the Hamatchi was delightful, if you love spicy. GET IT!!!! and the flavor on par! The presentation... O_O it was too pretty to eat. Haha :) and the rice crispy, it speaks for itself. It was nice crispy. Haha ;D  Overall. This place was exquisite. I would definitely dress up and have date night here. Even though it says casual. The menu had a great selection and the price was reasonable. Everything was wonderful.   The reason why I gave it a four star because we ordered the edamame....... and it came out last. Instead of a starter. Booo.. I was so full then. :( it's okay. I still love it.   I'll be back for sure!!!! :D

My friend ordered a steak gyro with fries on the side, He enjoyed his meal.  The service was wonderful. Great staff.

My mom would order something and he kept saying that they don't have it in yet. 4 times.. haha. Oh geez. Anddd they had ONE server. 35 minutes for our entrée to come out. Andddd I never got my hot water after I asked twice! My moms ordered mi Bo kho. Her noodles was hard she said. And the meat was super soft and wasn't tasteful.. my tufo vegetarian rice was soggy and cold. :(   This place isn't for me...

This place is literally 2.3 seconds away from my house. I'm so glad that this place is open at 7am so my mom and I can have breakfast together and make it on time to work.   I Love the decor. Love the atmosphere and everything about this place. Look up at the ceiling. Hehe super cute.  The owner here is very nice. Very accommodating. And was very welcoming. I had the pancakes, fruits and potatoes on the side. And my mom had the eggs, sausage and potatoes. Our breakfast was wonderful. Except the potatoes, it was hard. So we took it back. Instead of getting new potatoes. They reimbursed our money back. Which wasn't what I asked for, the owner and I fight back and forth. He is just too kind. Great customer service!!   I'll be back  :D

Aussie owners?! Yessss it is. Her name is Carly, her, her husband and her brother open the Base for 3 months now. She's super cute. Geez her accent, her energy is great and super friendly! The restaurant has such a good vibe to it. Nice patio and great layout.  I absolutely love this place. Holy cow my mushroom truffle pizza was amazing. Especially with the ghost oil sauce. I took off the lid to taste the chili. Two thumbs up!   I shall be back :D

Literally beyond excited that this is 2.3 seconds away from me. No longer have to go to Scottsdale for flower child. Yayyyyyy!  Seriously, I love everything on the menu  (vegetarian of course) tofu, please. The salad to the rice and to the wraps. AND THEY HAVE MUSHROOM PHO! It's a must. *smiley face*   Every time I come, we always sit outside, great atmosphere and love the energy here.   I love the lemonade stands. So many yummy drinks to choose from. So if your indecisive, pick two and mix that baby together.  Haha. It's perfect.  Keep on coming back!!!

I heard this place opened,  And I wanted to try it out. Of course I take my family here for breakfast. Counter order and then sit down. I like the vibe. Love the whole atmosphere and how this place is set up. And what? Bar? Super cute.   We sat outside. Beautiful day to sit out and enjoy a good breakfast. I ordered the egg whites with avocado on a bagel. It was so good, especially with the hot sauce. I asked the guy about it,  he said the hot sauce was homemade.. *TWO THUMBS UP*  I ordered a hot chai tea latte... I seriously think it tastes like Starbucks chai tea latte. Lolz. Maybe that's why I like it so much. Haha.  I'll be back for the hot sauce. Haha.

Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Lou malnati's in Phoenix Arizona? Central Phoenix? Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I couldn't believe it. I order lou's pizza from Chicago a handful of times. It was amazing!!! But to have it down the street from my house is even more amazing!. Ahhhhhh.  Alright, let's see. Where do I begin, Grand opening was today. The line was ridiculous. An hour wait, waiting outside while the line loops around to the restaurant. Then another 40 minute wait inside... lame I know. We were at the restaurant for 3 1/2 hours. Including the wait and as we dine in.   The decor was so simple and so family-friendly.  Love the "say cheese" sign.The mirror made the room look so much bigger.  We had to order our pizza before sitting down because it would take awhile. My family ordered Penne alla Vodka, honey bbq wings, and butter crust pepperoni pizza. Chicago style of course. They loved it. No complaint there. Had to bring pizza to go of course. It's so full and filling  I ordered the personal vegetarian pizza call " The lou" with no parmigiano. I had to educate the girls at the desk why I can't have parmigiano, well, here's why. because it has RENNET in it. They looked at me like I was crazy..... So yeah... they didn't know what it was until I said it was stomach from baby calves. They both were grossed out. Haha. I hope they know next time I come in.  I'LL BE BACK!!!!!  It's not a good thing for a Vietnamese female to be fat and loving pizza... but i do. *smile*

First and foremost.. How confusing this place was to order food. We had to order food on the pats and Waldo side. Even though otakumen has their own separate line. Anyways. You order food, sit down and they bring it to you. So. I ordered the vegan ramen. It was so bland, I asked for hot sauce, it was eehhhhh. At least I try to make the broth better. Tofu is the MAIN thing in this bowl....but I never got tofu in my bowl.  *sad face*    I don't know about this place. I was super excited about vegan ramen... but it failed me.

This place just opened last week on Tuesday. Honey and I decided to break this joint in. Who doesn't want to eat and listen to Easy E, Tu Pac, Dre.. Then switch to guns and medal ..? love itttttt. The menu has biggie and the shorties on them. Ahha.  I love the set up in this place, open kitchen and bar, nice dim lighting, open patio with bistro lights and a fire place, candles on each table, candles on the walls, the quotes on the walls, loud music  This place just have a feel good vibe.  They didn't have a vegetarian entrée so I ordered sides. The shishitos, it was good. Either of us got the spicy one. Haha. Also the veggie flatbread and the roasted cauliflower. I didn't finish the roasted cauliflower because it was too salty for me.  My boyfriend got the B.I.G notorious Burger! He killed it!   This place opens til 2pm. Why not do a midnight run to Joe's place.

Finally a family restaurant thats put into use in this poor building... which its use to be a beef eaters.  I came here with my mother and sister!  :)   Such a good atmosphere here.  As an appetizer, we have the macaroni and cheese. It was delicious. The texture and the cheese was on point. Mom, she got the catfish. Was not fond of it at all. It was so oily and very salty... :/  Sister, she got pork ribs, it was delicious and the side corn salad was like salsa mix, she enjoyed it.  Me, I had the broccoli, cauliflower casserole.....It was too salty, too cheesy, not enough broccoli and too much onions in it :(    Our waiter was so attentive in the beginning. Then midway, she forgot a few things and didn't come to the table til I ask for the bill..  Me likes scaring him I'm doing things right Maybe, I'll try something else?

The boys love this place. Who doesn't love fresh ice cream? They don't make it til you order it. They make it in front of you using nitrogen. Smoke comes out really colr and the the boys had kick out of it. It was like a show. Haha. I love how white it is in there. So clean and literally looks like a lab. Haha. Well, kinda. The boys had the cookies and cream with the brownie on the side. And I had the waffle bowl with mint chocolate chip. The waffle was so thing and crisp. It was delicious. There's vegan options. Horrayyy. I'll be back.yayyyy. we all scream for ice cream.
