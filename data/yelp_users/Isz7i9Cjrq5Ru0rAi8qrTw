I'm going to go out on a limb and claim this is better then Pizzeria Bianco.  You don't have to wait for hours and hours and the pizza is better!  Cute place, great pizza, good wine, and I would highly recommend any of the nutella crepes.

Food was okay, I am not waiting all day for it though.  If I could go in and get a table right away I'd eat here again, but waiting more than 10 minutes, no thank you!  I would rather walk to Matadors or First Watch....  P.S. Go for the rosemary potatoes not the hash browns, unless, of course, you would like some hash browns with your grease.

Good food, horrible service.  I've been multiple times and often I get my food and then I am ignored until I walk up to the hostess stand ask for my check.

I loved my stay at the Palazzo!  My boyfriend and I stayed here for the first time over Memorial Day weekend.  We are frequent visitors to Las Vegas and have stayed almost everywhere (I'm talking 100+ trips).  My check in was a breeze, they had the room I wanted available and it only took a few minutes to get the keys.  (We've stayed at other places [MGM] where we book one room, but by the time we check in they don't have any available - nothing irritates me more!)    Our room was on the 27th floor and we had an amazing view of TI and the Trump.  The bathroom was spacious and included a vanity area, shower, tub, 2 sinks and a TV.  The sunken living room area had an L-shaped couch, TV and desk/office area complete with a printer.  The bedroom area had a 2nd TV.  My only complaint about the room was that bed could have been more comfortable, not that it was uncomfortable, but stay at the Trump once and you'll want to sleep in a bed like that every night.  We went to the pool Sunday afternoon and after getting a late start I was sure we would not be able to find chairs.  When we went to go get our towels they asked us if they wanted them to look for 2 chairs for us.   It took them about 15 minutes, but they got us 2 chairs next to each other and away from most other people.    Hungry, just head to the 2nd floor and take your pick of amazing restaurants.  Table 10 is one of our favorites.  Entertainment, the Zebra lounge had an 80's cover band playing Sunday night and we had a blast listening to them!  The staff was really nice; every staff member I encountered said hi and asked my stay was going.  I'm no high roller, but I sure felt like luxury staying here!  It was an excellent experience and will be going back soon!

You know the saying, "A good dog is a tired dog"?  This place will help you have a good dog!     I've boarded my 8 month old puppy here twice and taken her countless times for daycare.  She loves the daycare, in the morning I'll say, "ready for daycare" and she'll run to the door and drag me to the car!   When we pull up she gets really excited in the car too!   The best part is, she comes home exhausted from playing all day and sleeps like an angel.  I've been using the daycare a lot more now that it's so hot and I can't walk her as much.    The pricing seems reasonable to me, especially considering all the benefits.  This place doesn't charge you extra for playtime or anything like some places do.  They will also post videos to facebook of the dogs playing - it makes my day when I see my puppy in one of them!

Tom was fantastic!  I got his number from a friend, called him Sunday night and we set up an appointment for Monday morning.  He called to confirm prior to our appointment.  I told him I wanted new locks and after looking at what I currently had, he said the best option would be to rekey them.  He worked quickly and was very nice and professional.  He also made sure I tried all the locks before he left.    Service was quick and Tom was a pleasure to work with!

David was awesome!  He painted our new townhouse.  He did all the walls in 3 bedrooms, living room, dining room, kitchen and our half bath all in about a week!  We had about 9 different colors total for various rooms and accent walls.  I had gotten samples of all the colors and he matched them exactly.  We even have some leftover paint for touch ups.  He did a great job and at a really decent price.  He is a very nice guy and easy to work with.  I would highly recommend him.

Was in Vegas for Memorial Day weekend and after seeing endless advertisements for the bets buffet in town - I was persuaded to try Wicked Spoon on my last day.  One of the things on my to-do list was a champagne brunch, so this seemed fitting before my departure.  It was a bit of a shock that brunch with drinks was $48 a person, but I told myself it would be worth it for the best buffet in town.  This was my first and last visit to 2 Wicked Spoon.  We sat down and waited a few minutes to order champagne before heading up for our breakfast round of brunch.  Personally, I enjoy eggs at brunch, the only eggs to be had were if you waited in the omelette line, so I did - for 15 minutes.  I returned to our table to find my boyfriend being reseated.  When I asked why he pointed to the right side of his body covered in coffee - yep that's right the waiter tripped and spilled coffee all over him. I told the waiter how disappointed I was and he got his manager - all she could offer us was a $40 gift certificate to the Hotel.  She also didn't seem too concerned with our dissatisfaction.    The food was also disappointing, they were running out of items left and right.  I really wanted to try the tri trip, I was offered the leftover fatty scraps, but I opted to wait the 15 minutes for a fresh piece of meat.  I was also excited to see Mac 'n cheese, I love the stuff, however this Mac n cheese I was thoroughly disappointed with.  It was bland and a bit cold - ick!  All around, subpar food, crappy service and too high of a price point.

These guys were awesome!    Friday night around 6pm we noticed hundreds of little black bugs on our back patio where we let our dog out.  I totally freaked out!  Looked up exterminator on yelp and Arizona Pest Squad came up so I called.  I called Friday night around 6:30, David answered and we made an appointment for Saturday morning.  David and his colleague were really friendly and so good with our dog.  They sprayed and set up a follow-up appointment.  They even charged less than what was quoted on the phone because our patio area wasn't that big.    These guys will be our go to exterminator!

I was a little reluctant to try this place after reading the reviews, but I was in need of a mani/pedi and I live within walking distance I gave it a try.  I'm really glad I did!    The service was friendly and so were the other customers.  I got a gel manicure and regular pedicure.  They were offing 20% off that day so I think my total was less than $50.  It's been a little over a week and my nails still look great, no chipping or anything.    My only complaint is they did they manicure and pedicure separate, I usually like when they can do both at once - saves time.  I'll be going back for sure!

I called last night and asked about fixing a broken screen on my phone.  They asked what kind of phone I had and I told them a 6S, the person I spoke with said it could be fixed and it would be $109.  I asked what time they opened on Sunday and they told me 11.  I planned my day around going in at 11 so I could have my phone fixed.  I arrived and they told me they could not fix an iPhone 6S.  It's on their website that they can and the employee working Saturday night said they could, yet they can't.  Had I known last night that they couldn't fix it I would have made other arrangements for it today.    Please make sure your website is accurate and your employees are trained so people like me don't waste their time with your store.

My friends and I got a Living Social deal and decided to check this place.  We had never done a class like this and we are accountants by day, so we weren't really sure what to expect.  We had so much fun!!!  We got there about 20 minutes early, there were a few people there already, but it was nice because we got pick where we wanted to sit.  We brought some snacks and wine.  They had a table in the back and we set out our snacks to share.  There were also plenty of wine openers and cups.    The owner, Anthony, was also the instructor; he was really nice, helpful and patient with everyone.   We painted the Eiffel Tower, so there was a lot of instruction on where to put dots and lines and at the end it really did look like the Eiffel Tower!    The location is great, its near 4th St and McKinley, so you are close to the AZ Center and The Turf/Pomo Pizza area.    It would be a great activity for a date night or girl's night out!  I will be going back for sure!

Love this place!    They have a great selection of beer and wine and the specialty cocktails aren't too shabby either.  The paninis are really good, I've had the pesto chicken, roast beef and cheddar and the Greek one - they are all delicious!  The homemade foccaicia bread they have is excellent.  I usually get the side salad with it and it's perfect sized meal, I feel very satisfied when I'm done and overly full or having to leave food on the plate.  You can also get pasta salad or potatoes au gratin.    Everything is reasonably priced too, some of the paninis are $5!  Can't beat that for a lunch or dinner.  The service is excellent , the bar tenders and owner have always been very nice and helpful.
