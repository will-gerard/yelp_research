As a Realtor/landlord here in the valley for 30 years, DJ provided THE MOST excellent, professional, exceptional and immediate service for my property needs - 5 stars isn't a high enough ranking.  DJ, VetsBuilt.com, many thanks and I look forward to the next project!

DO NOT HIRE THIS CONTRACTOR.  I worked with Vasile, owner.  Found him on HomeAdvisor.com.  What a nightmare.  Ended up costing me time and money and still had to find someone else to repair the mess he created.
