I'll start off by saying PetSmart is a great one-stop shop for your furry little family member.  I shop at the Surprise location quite often, have taken a couple training classes and used the grooming services a few times.   This review is for the grooming services.  I have taken my puppy to the PetSmart groomers three times which was three times too many.   First time: bad haircut.  Second time: foot long scratch down the side of his stomach and bad haircut again.  Third time: Gave specific haircut directions and still got the same bad haircut.  My biggest concern is how the groomers treat the animals.  I should have known better, the second and third time I took my puppy to the groomer he hung onto me for dear life. Don't get me wrong, he loves going to PetSmart but the minute we walk into the grooming section he turns into this freakishly scared little puppy which is completely out of character.  Three tries and $200 later - never again!

The Philosophy store is a serious hike from where I live...but well worth it!  The sales staff is extremely knowledgeable, friendly and passionate about the product (I actually felt they were a little more knowledgeable and interested in the product than the department stores).  Great shopping experience - I will definitely return!

Typical British pub. The most memorable thing about this place was how BAD the steak and mushroom pie was - yuck! Perhaps it's just not my type of food but the flavor was so appalling I could barely eat it, I ended up leaving the pub hungry!

I recently ate at Las Fuentes for the first time.  I'm not really a connoisseur of Mexican food because I don't eat it that often but I did think it was pretty tasty.  The portions are enormous - I highly recommend sharing a plate with whoever you're with.  The restaurant was nice and clean and the service was great!  Overall I give it four stars. Although it was good, it was a little pricey for Mexican food.

I purchased the Deegie's Carma Groupon back in January and finally went in for my service (April was the soonest I could get in).  The Groupon included a facial, mani/pedi and a hair blowout for $50 - can't beat that!  The facial was wonderful!  I really enjoyed it, my skin felt so clean and fresh. You better believe I will be back for another one.  The mani/pedi was OK, nothing special.  There was a little bit of confusion with the mani/pedi portion of my appointment.  The nail tech had another client booked so one of the hair stylists filled in for her.  No big deal, appointment mix-ups happen.  There is a chance the mani/pedi would have been better if the nail tech did it.  However I was happy that they instantly came up with a solution to the appointment conflict.  The hair blowout was OK, to be honest I couldn't really tell the difference - my hair looked the exact same.  Actually...there was one difference in my hair after the blowout - major static!    The store had a salon, boutique and a cafe - interesting concept I've never seen before - I liked it!  Overall, I give DC four stars.

Wow, I was impressed!  Upper Crust is a family style restaurant; the owner and staff are very interactive and make every guest feel right at home.    We ordered a 'small' pizza and a 'personal' calzone; both were absolutely delicious. The ingredients were fresh and the service was excellent, it felt like I ate a million calories but I guess that's always what if feels like when you eat something this good.  The portions are huge so expect to have leftovers!
