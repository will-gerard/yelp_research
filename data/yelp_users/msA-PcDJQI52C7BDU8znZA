I could not be more satisfied with my experience at LVMS. I've been to NASCAR races at a few other tracks, so my thoughts on LVMS are based partly on those experiences. Unlike Kansas Speedway, the traffic flow into the track is quick and easy (leaving wasn't as smooth, but I've sat in traffic longer at Kansas and Indy). The flyover by the Air Force Thunderbirds was awesome. Our seats were pretty good and reasonably priced. We had chicken strips and fries, which were ok. The lemonade was good.   Don't get ripped off by the shuttle bus companies on the Strip. They were charging $40 per person to get from the Strip to the track, but Enterprise and Avis will rent you a car for about $40 per day, so you can save money by driving yourself.

We stayed one night here in the Empire State Building. We booked a non-smoking room through Expedia, and were kind of disappointed that our room had been a smoking room until recently. Unfortunately the smokey smell was still present in the room. Aside from that, this hotel and casino was pretty fun. Our room was big, although the bathroom left something to be desired with it's tiny shower and low shower head. The casino is pretty nice compared to others on the strip. It's comparable to the other MGM properties. The food court area designed like a New York City street is fun and offers a decent variety. The patrons seem less pretentious here than at some of the other casinos. I would probably stay here again.

Coming from the Midwest, I'd never really experienced the desert until we hiked the short waterfall trail here. It's amazing just how large the cacti are. We visited the park after a Royals spring training game in Surprise on the recommendation of the Royals website and a friend who lives in the area. I'm really glad we made the short drive over to the park.  Maricopa County should be proud of the way this park is being run. The gate attendant was very friendly and the park was very clean.  The waterfall trail was a pretty simple hike of .9 miles out and back. While it doesn't sound like there is a waterfall except after heavy rains, the trail was still nice with plenty of scenery. The air force jets that flew over while we were there also added to our enjoyment.  Overall, we really enjoyed hiking here.

I really enjoyed seeing two Royals games at Surprise Stadium this spring. Uncle Jimmy's cheesesteaks in the left field concourse area were really good as we the ice cream from the booth next door. I liked the ice cream place's frozen lemonade as well. My wife had a BBQ chicken sandwich from the "Battle of the BBQ" stand and was a little disappointed. Evidently Surprise isn't going to win any BBQ battles with KC or even Texas for that matter.  We had great seats, although they were very narrow. If you want to ensure your seats are in the shade, choose seats between first base and home plate or seats in the second level.  Gates to the Royals practice fields open at 10:00, and players, especially minor leaguers, were very accommodating to kids seeking autographs or moms with cameras taking pictures.  Special thanks to the Surprise firefighters who taped up my hand after I sliced it open trying to grab a batting practice ball. Thanks for not making fun of me too much and for the Jr Firefighter sticker.

Enterprise should be embarrassed to have their name on this location.  We arrived the Westin on foot and found Enterprise tucked in a dingy little corner. We were greeted by a young lady who was really sick. She could barely talk and kept coughing. She pulled my reservation up, and said she would have a guy go get our car. I was under the impression that was going to happen immediately, but after a couple minutes of patiently waiting I asked the young lady if it normally took this long. She informed me it would be about 10 or 15 minutes. I figured that meant our car was being cleaned. I was wrong again. Ten minutes later, we were escorted outside to a car that looked as if the Taliban used it to escape the US Marines in Kandahar. It was covered in dust inside and out. To make it even worse, it only had 3/8 of a tank of fuel inside and the automatic door locks didn't work.  The sick attendant got kind of moody about my decision to decline Enterprise's insurance coverage too. I still have no idea what took so long to get us in the car that morning. I'm glad we didn't wait to be picked up at our hotel, we'd probably still be there.  If it weren't for good service I have received from every other Enterprise location I've used, I'd never rent from them again based on this experience.

We stayed here while in Surprise to watch the Royals at spring training. Our room was very nice with stainless steel appliances. Breakfast wasn't tremendous, but was ok and saved us time and money going somewhere else. There is a waffle maker, a variety of cereals, muffins, and fruit. The hotel pool area is nice as well and features a small basketball court.  The hotel is located within a short walk of Surprise Stadium, so it is very convenient for Royals or Rangers fans. It is also conveniently located near Bell Road, which has a Target and nearly every type of restaurant available within a short drive.

I'd like to award this place with more stars, but our waiter was terrible. We were here late after driving in to town from Phoenix. A friend recommended this place, so we thought we'd check it out. The food was good. The bowl of berries listed as a breakfast side dish could be it's own meal. The berries were all big, fresh, and juicy. My wife enjoyed her breakfast crepe.  Unfortunately, the service sucked. I don't know if it was because we didn't order alcohol or if it was because we weren't a group of 21 year olds in short skirts, but either way our waiter basically ignored us the entire time we were in this place. It took forever to get a glass of water and a Sierra Mist. It look even longer for him to bring out our bill and run my credit card. One of the hostesses, had to call him on her radio. I could understand if we were there during prime dinner hours and the place was busy, but less than half of the tables were occupied. I'm disappointed I can't give this joint more stars because the food was pretty good.

Stopped in for lunch before going to the Royals game at Surprise Stadium. We read all the positive reviews on Yelp, so we figured it must be a winner. We had a really nice conversation with the owner regarding the various menu options. He told us Rito's is best known for its green chili burritos, so a couple members of our party ordered those. I had a taco and a green chili beef enchilada. Both were great. The green chili sauce was quite tasty on the enchilada. It's not really hot, but it does have a little kick to it. The taco was superb. The shell was authentic, not some silly Old El Paso shell someone got at Wal-Mart. The filling was even better. Perfect meat to cheese/lettuce ratio. The burritos are BIG and the folks in our party who ordered them were pleased. Also it's definitely worth it to get an order of chips and hot sauce. The sauce is sort of hot, but delicious. It's got a unique and addictive flavor. The chips are also very fresh and perfectly salted. We'll definitely dine here on our next spring training trip. Keep up the great work guys!

Sloan Park has more of a major league feel to it than most other Spring Training stadiums, which is fine, but I kind of prefer the more relaxed feel of a place like Surprise Stadium. This was our first visit to Sloan Park, and we came to see the visiting team, rather than the Cubs. The park is quite beautiful and well designed to provide a lot of shade to most of the seating areas.   The crowd was really good and reminiscent of Wrigley's party atmosphere. It felt a little like being teleported to Chicago. To that point, our day at Sloan Park was a "food vacation." We really enjoyed the Chicago dogs, Italian beef sandwiches, and even the Old Styles. Speaking of food, we saw a corn dog vendor toss a footlong corn dog to a lady in the upper deck. She made a sweet catch on it just like Mark Grace would have done back in the day. Then she paid him by making it rain singles from the upper deck. He was a good sport about the whole thing and it was quite fun for everyone watching.   A lot of reviews mention the parking situation being less than ideal. We had a pretty long walk, but I didn't find it to be bad. You can hire a pedi-cab to pedal you to the gate if the walk is that big of a deal or pay a little more to park closer.   Overall it was a fun day at Sloan Park. The only negative was Kris Bryant didn't play. I'd enjoy taking in another game at Sloan Park on our next Spring Training trip.
