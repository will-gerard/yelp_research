There was a small line at 9 am but the owner got everyone taken care of and gave me a deadline to pick up my phone.  It was ready on time and they are a very polite, knowledgable team.  2 hours to get my glass replaced on my Samsung S3.  I could not be happier.

I first heard about Mike and Ronda's "The Place" when i lived in Flagstaff.  I found in Flagstaff that the service was top notch and you can get a lot of food for your dollar.  I now have the benefit of living near this location and the service is just as good.  One thing I will also say is that the service is consistent.  On the weekends the lines are long but they do a great job moving people through.

There are many mom and pop pizza places in town but everytime I call these guys they are excellent.  The phone peeps always seem knowledgable the food is good, and I will keep going back

Went there with my friends that just got married.  The waitress came up super friendly suggested shots and we all agreed and then it all went down hill.  The shots took 20 to 30 minutes to come to the table.  BTW this place was not busy, only 2 or 3 tables and in the middle of the day.  When the shots came she took our order and the mozzarella sticks (all 5 of them for $9) came out with the food.  The sticks were cold inside.  i.e. could not even microwave these hot enough.  The steak my wife had tasted dry and burnt, not quite medium.  Waitress brought our the ketchup, but it was empty.  I had fries with my meal as did every one else.  They had a normal portion I have 8 - 10 fries.  Next my friend gave her $100 for a $40 check, and she had to get manager approval to break the $100. This place could really not get any worst.  This is a top down issue when so many things go wrong.  Should change the name to FUBAR!

Stopped in Wickenburg on Easter Sunday and grabbed some food at Bedoian's.  The food was fantastic and the service at this small town restaurant was outstanding.

I grew up with Happy Joe's Pizza from my home town of Davenport Iowa.  The folks that started the location in Gilbert are doing a great job at providing a warm inviting environment and the same high quality food I am use to from back home.  I know they are working on expanding and I can't wait to see where that takes them. Terry Day
