What a great local dive bar. First time in we got a 20 ounce kiltlifter, vodka soda, and giant order of fries for seven bucks. So awesome.   The burgers are legitimately good. Expect fried greasy goodness. This is definitely a bar style burger but all that grease will adequately lube up your face hole for $2pbr and cheap chicken wings. There are TVs to watch games and there are two surprisingly level pool tables.   If you want frills or mixologists this isn't your place. If you want cheap beer and delicious clogged arteries served by a bartender who will serve you complimentary cement mixer shots as punishment (congratulations?) when your team beats hers this is your spot.

really awesome Indian food. do the chicken rogan Josh. the spice level is often a bit of a mystery ranging from unbearable to pretty mild on the same dish on different days but its an adventure! the staff is always very friendly and welcoming. do it!

Been going here for years. They have worked on all the vehicles in my family and they will always be the ones I go to! They have never run up a bill and this isn't the place where you go in for brakes and they tell you you need a new engine. Prices are maybe a bit more than other places but they are definitely fair and peace of mind is worth it knowing they aren't throwing parts at you.

Don't listen to "Nitti L"! This is simply the best vet in town. Our animals have been seen by I think every doctor here at this point and they are all fantastic. They are thorough and genuinely care about you and your animals. They are compassionate and intelligent. At times we have walked in with no appointment at all with a sick animal and have never been turned away. The other day I arrived with two cats instead of one and they fit us in. They even know the animals by name. Highly recommended!!

Amazing personal family style service. The staff made us feel welcome and provided a fun warm atmosphere. I would go back in a heartbeat. I saw a complaint below that it was loud. Its a family style authentic restaurant so if you're surprised that it's loud you don't deserve to enjoy the delicious food and awesome service. If you want quiet atmosphere go eat some French food.   The food was fresh and authentic.They have fresh seafood saturdays.  Highly recommended

New management? Have used this Leslie's for 15 years now and bought a $400 Hayward vacuum 4 months ago. The old manager who has always helped me, Richard, was nowhere to be found. I took it in to get serviced on the warranty and the rude guy behind the counter told me he had no record of me buying it. I informed him that he was even the one who sold it to me and he said "without a receipt I can't do anything for you." I showed him the registration sticker and he said "we don't use those". I told him he could call Hayward and he said "No we don't do that either."   So I went home and got the receipt and called Leslie's corporate. They said to not go to that store anymore and said that employee should have called Hayward and  checked the serial number and not to go back to that store because of the poor service. So that's what I did and I won't be going back.

Not so psyched. It was packed when I went in which I can't fault them for but I couldn't understand why. I ordered a dirty chai with almond milk and, I hate to say it, but I have had better at Starbucks. The espresso wasn't roasted to my taste and the drip coffee was weak. It does have a lot of seating which may make it a good place to sit, but the prices were pretty high so sitting a while gets expensive.   If I find myself studying in Tempe again I will be going up the road to SOLO. I would pass on this place

Super friendly staff. The guy at the counter gave me a sample of the green Chile which was fantastic. The chips took a minute to come out because they were literally frying fresh tortilla chips. Fantastic food and really good personable service. Authentic dishes like birria and lengua and food to satisfy the gringo like carne asada. Go there!

In my quest for the best dirty Chai in Phoenix this place is up there. The girl that made it did some madness with spices over the top and it was delicious. I have also had more than a few baked goods and hot damn the M&M cookies are good! Also Ingrid Hirtz is slingin food like a pro so you can rest assured there is love cooked into every bite!

Legitimately family owned place. I am pretty sure there are three generations of owners in the place at any one time.  The tortas are really good. The bread is soft and fresh and the salsa bar is gigantic.   Recommended!

My go to in Tempe! I read a review about poor service below and can't say I have ever had that experience. This is a privately owned place and you shouldn't expect a fake smile and "high welcome to SOLO you dream it we steam it!" The vibe is welcoming and the owner knew my name literally the second time I came in.  Their teas are definitely a highlight. They have a giant selection of loose leaf that they will make iced or hot for you. If you are in a huge rush you may be a bit stressed stopping by as they can take a minute to make your drink but it's usually because they are talking with you! Always a positive experience. Good coffee, great tea, and a super friendly genuine staff!

The best pho I have ever had! prices are dirt cheap and the food is amazing! Do the spring rolls and you won't regret it. can't say enough good things. It is a little dirty but....well....don't go to a hole in the wall pho house if you want white table cloths.

Best coffee shop in the valley hands down. The roasts are better than Lux and the vibe is more welcoming. They will know your name the second time you come in and know your drink shortly after.   The espresso is fantastic and the prices are cheaper than your local Starbucks. The baked goods are consistently good and the food is great as well. Try the herbed chicken sandwich!   All in all a fantastic welcoming place with outstanding coffee, great prices, and very friendly staff!

Love it. Menu is greatly expanded since I was last here and its fantastic. Lots of options from crepes to sandwiches to omelettes to baked goods. Of course full coffee bar. I also love that they're open all night Friday and Saturday. Five stars!

This place is watered down. First you get packed into cafeteria style seating elbow to elbow. Then the lights dim for 15 minutes of prerecorded "goofy" ads for the club you're already in and a video about the rules. At this point I was upset that I had to sit through movie theater style advertisements with no drink and no wait staff yet. Really sitting through their 15 minutes of movie theater style ads put me off the most. It was just so impersonal and cold.   Hallelujah the server is here! Two drink minimum is standard at comedy clubs so that is fine. There are no prices anywhere on the menu and when I ask cocktails are "13-15 dollars but we only use top shelf liquor." Pricey! I can see why they don't list the prices.   A bad venue doesn't make a comedian less funny but the sour taste you'll be left with (for $13-$15) makes it hard to go in with a positive attitude. I will be going to any of the other local clubs from now on.

The chai competes for the best in Phoenix. This place and Matador need to have a chai showdown because it would be a delicious spicy bloodbath.   Comfy seating with a reliable WiFi connection (hallelujah) and good music. The place is inviting with a cool atmosphere. For a drink and some work on the computer I would come here any day and would drive a bit farther to come here and avoid the crowd at lux.

I can't say enough good things about this place! The beer is absolutely fantastic. I have not had anything here I didn't like. They had an Oatmeal double IPA and it was one of, and this is not an exaggeration, the best IPA's I have had. Up there with the Dogfish 90 minute. The Pizzas are fantastic and the happy hour is incredible. I hope they are around for a long time to come.

Ridiculous amazing service. The owner came and talked with us as he had a boatload of complimentary appetizers brought out. Family owned and almost all of the food is locally sourced with sausage from Schreiners and beef from neiman ranch. Food was delicious and carefully made. A great phoenix addition!

Not anything like the original. Ordered a carne asada burrito, she rang it up as a breakfast burrito, refunded my money, made a new transaction for a carne asada burrito, and when I got home bit into a breakfast burrito. Great. Now I paid nine bucks for a breakfast burrito.

Oh The Pig. Found this place tucked between  the TexAz grill and a palm reader . It doesn't get much more hole-in-the-walley than this spot.  Unless you live in a hostel its smaller than your living room. This is fantastic actually. It forces everyone to get to know one another. There are dozens of classic board games for your entertainment which is a definite highlight.   The beer selection is pretty out of this world and the bartenders are infinitely knowledgeable about the beer as well as the enormous wine selection. The beers are obviously hand picked which I appreciate. Its all bottles or cans which is a little tough but the selection more than makes up for it.   Staff is quick and eager to dig up something special. Do it.

One of my favorite new spots. I would eat the pork ramen every day if I could. The food is consistent and delicious and the cocktails are well crafted. Staff is always kind and attentive. Check them out for a very good Happy hour. Try the curry and the steamed buns!

Extremely small portions. We ordered the Roman gnocchi and it came in a bowl with literally a one gnocchi. $10 for a single gnocchi. The server told us it would be cheaper to buy a bottle of wine and after the fact we looked at the menu and it would nave ended up $7 cheaper if we went by the glass. The food was indeed good and I like that it is local but the portions were so small we went to a food truck after.

The food was good and the atmosphere was nice as well. Feels like a wine bar more than a restaurant. Our server was a little scatterbrained but she made up for it with being very personable and even sitting down go chat.  The scallop cevice was really good but it lacked enough bread for vessels. we also had the cheese plate which also lacked some sort of vessel as it was literally a plate of cheese until we payed extra for some bread. The appetizers really need more bread or some chips or something.  the entrees were pretty fantastic. Someone below said they took "liberties" with the pork but I thought it was fantastic. If you want the classic take on classic dishes don't come here cause the food is adventurous and tasty. It was a bit pricey when all was said and done but if you want a low key dinner with quality food and decent portions and good atmosphere definitely try it out! Just be sure to pay for some extra bread....

Really excellent beer selection unrivaled by anywhere except The Whining Pig. Even more games than the Whining Pig including a Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, and original Nintendo.   The bartender was absolutely militant about insisting that "we are nothing like the Whining Pig. The owners are not the same, we're not at all like them". She seemed actually angry about it. The name is obviously close,  the owner used to own the Whining Pig, the chalk board lists are the same, the room is set up the same, the games are the same, the music is the same, there are literal identical food offerings plus a slightly expanded menu,  the bulding ia the same down to the tiles on the wall. Yet she was so insistent  that the two were vastly different that she was almost rude about it. Strange.  In spite of the militant attitude regarding being SO different than Whining Pig this place is solid.  Just enough room to keep a very intimate atmosphere, plenty of games, and a separate large room for big parties or stretching. Oh..and the beer selection. Don't forget the beer selection

Maybe the best beans in the valley. Small batch roasted with lots of options in addition to their normal offerings. I had some Ethiopian cheffe that floored me. You can pick up the beans at a lot of the weekly farmers markets.   Beans are also available at then physical location in tempe. Be aware this location is mostly here for roasting and isn't a typical coffee shop. They aren't always serving coffee so if you want a latte you should call first and make sure someone is there to make it.   If you do go to buy beans, which is why you should be there, expect to be impressed. They let you smell and taste whatever you want and really work to find you something you will enjoy.   Go get some beans!

Really great breakfast spot! Service is quick enough where you don't have to call ahead on the way to work. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. The staff is extremely friendly and always welcoming. I've been a few times already and this will be a nice new breakfast staple. Try the croque Monsieur!
