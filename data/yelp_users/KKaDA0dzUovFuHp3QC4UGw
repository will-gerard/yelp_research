By far the best place to have your car worked on. I've come here over the years with multiple cars. The owners know you and work with you. They are trustworthy and their work is what has brought me back time and again. Prices are fare and I've never felt ripped off and no one I've been to has beaten their prices.

I trully cant say anything bad just i wish this place were bigger in tempe! It does get pretty packed but so worth it. We come here for lunch very often because of the service which has been always great even though they are packed in but thats what makes it nostalgic. It reminds me of back east. I love it, major kudo's Spinato's!

Cartel is better, the service isn't very good. Even though the atmosphere is nice and great decor they are secretly lacking in service and courtesy

This has to be my favorite bookstore/store in Arizona. No Im not a book worm but when you are there it makes you want to be. Its great for kids, readers, and trinket shoppers. One thing that i found and do find is what a store will do to solve an issue or whatever sets them apart from the rest and for a book store they have done just that. I was searching for The Little Prince in hardback the clerk apologized for not having it and then ordered it! what can you say to that. I have been loyal ever since.

Bomb! Everything's about 10 but worth it and if you don't eat it all you get 2 for 1 since it's a lot. You get a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal as a nice touch on top of that homemade jam which they should bottle and sell. I'm not a breakfast fan in general but yum!

BlackBerry lime iced team is amazing and kid approved. The pastries are delicious and so far this is moving up to be one of my new favorite places.

My favorite place by far in Tempe and I am so happy they are closer to my work on Mill ave. I picked up take out at thier back bar from Tia. She was very nice and attentive since I decided to stay and eat. The decor is a nice upgrade to thier original location as well. Like always I will be back!

Clean and nice looking. It's like a taco bell version to Japanese food. Food is eh. The meat was steamed cooked and veggies were as well. Nothing made actually fresh there, maybe the sushi but I didn't order that. It's a nice concept but mediocre.
