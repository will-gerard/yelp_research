I wasn't going to post a review, but after a follow-up phone call from this company I felt like I had to.  First of all their sales tactics are not ethical (at least in my opinion).  Initially they have someone canvasing the streets collecting water samples saying they're from Arizona Environmental Progress - making it sound like a state agency.  They take a sample of your water and go and test it for you.   So far not really a problem.  Then they come out with their sales pitch.  After I continue to explain to the salesperson that we really don't have to go through all the demonstrations because I know I have hard water and I know what soft water can do, the salesperson continues to go through her sales pitch.  Ok, so at this point I'm mildly annoyed, but still not really a problem.  At the end she starts to break down the cost of the system (over $6k) for their "patented" process.  Fair warning, the chemistry of turning hard water into soft water is not a secret.  A patent might exist for part of the system, but most systems will do the same thing to your water.  So what are you paying for?  A "lifetime" warranty and a ton of cleaning chemicals - that they also sell.  Keep in mind the "lifetime" warranty is ONLY on the components that won't wear out - everything else (valves, timers, etc.) is NOT covered.    So then she starts pitching the "direct marketing" price of around $4500.  But in order to get that price I HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION THAT DAY!  Zero time to put their claims to the test, look up reviews on their company and system, price out competitors, etc.  I explain that this is a huge red flag.  The sales lady then tried to tell me that it would be a lack of integrity to promise a price that ends that day and then provide the same price at a later date.  I explain to her that it is a lack of integrity, ethics, and faith in your product to not allow a customer time to do any research prior to making a major purchase like this.  So as she collects her things I look them up on the Better Business Bureau.  So despite the fact that she and her company boasted about their BBB rating, they have more customer complaints on their website than praise.  Same on Yelp for that matter.  I explain this to her and she says that anyone (their competitors) can go on there and make a complaint.  I explain to her that anyone (her company) can likewise go on their and make praise.  So at this point I've decided not to purchase their system.  Mainly because after actual research I found a better system for about a third of their "direct marketing" price.  I figured I would just let the whole thing go.  That is until I received a follow-up phone call from their company.  The lady on the phone started nice asking how the sales meeting went.  I started to explain that I wasn't a huge fan of their sales tactics (with the neighborhood canvasser, "direct marketing", etc.).  She just starts talking over me.  Telling me that the initial person handed out a paper specifically stating she wasn't with a government entity (no such paper was given to me).  Actually telling me that the Arizona Attorney General prevents them from offering the "direct marketing" price past the day of the sales pitch!  I called BS right away and as I'm attempting to explain to her just how full of it she was she continued to talk over me.  I was actually being very calm, reasonable, and honest as she just kept getting louder and louder.  Eventually I just told her if she didn't want my feedback she shouldn't ask for it and then hung up the phone.  Frankly, their sales tactics are deceptive, they are not customer friendly, and they are incapable of having rational conversations even on the phone.  There are BETTER water softening systems in the valley that are a FRACTION of the price that include up to 10 year warranties on EVERY PART OF THE SYSTEM.  If you want some advice, take a pass on this company.

This has been BY FAR been the WORST car buying experience I have EVER had.  Salesperson: Matt Mcleod Sales Manager: Howard Thayler  I went to look at a used Ford F-250. I looked at the truck and Matt kept telling me how great a truck it was while boasting about their multi-point inspection.  After a test drive, we are sitting at Matt's desk and start to talk price. He starts with a number outside my price range. I simply said it was outside my price range.  So he starts talking down the price while gauging my reaction. He comes to a number that he says he doesn't know if he can do but asked me to sign a handwritten piece of paper saying I will buy the truck if it is offered at the price HE came up with and wrote down. I wouldn't sign it. I simply said to go see if he could make it happen.  In comes Howard, the sales manager. Howard should NEVER be allowed to talk to customers! He is rude, condescending, and his manner comes off as borderline harassment.  He begins his pitch by asking me why they should consider selling me the truck at the price written down. I informed him that the price that was written down was put there by his salesperson, not me. He then proceeded to LECTURE me about why a premium is paid when you purchase a used car from a dealer - essentially boasting about the multi-point inspection. He assured me it was a clean truck and a steal for the price on the paper. I said I needed to make a phone call. I called my father and former neighbor (who owns several Ford dealerships in Utah). With their input, I decided that at that price I would have to sleep on it. I came back and told Matt and Howard that I would have to take some time on it while looking other places.    Howard began to harass me suggesting that I didn't know what I was doing and he "would hate for me to pass up a good deal based on a phone call."  He made me go look at the truck again. I simply stated at that price it was something I would have to sleep on. So they ASKED me what number would make me write a check that day. I made another phone call and basically said if they took another $1000 off their current asking price I would write a check that day. Howard was visibly upset. He went back to his office, came back, and said the best they could do was another $300 off their price they left off at. I thanked them for their time and began to leave. Howard, now apparently in a dealing mood, said he'd take off another $400 (give or take), putting it at $300 above the price I gave them. I said no.    Howard then VERY RUDELY AND CONDESCENDINGLY (more than he had been up until now - which was hard to believe he could top) said that he COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT I WAS HAGGLING AND BEING STINGY OVER $300!  So my obvious response was that I couldn't believe HE was haggling and being stingy over $300 and started walking to my car.  As I am almost to my car, Matt comes running after me and says they'll take my offer. At that point I was visibly upset and had lost all interest in the sale. I explained to Matt that Howard was an arrogant, unprofessional, condescending jerk and that I will not talk to him anymore. I told Matt I wanted to make another phone call from my car.    Here comes HOWARD!  He harassed me all the way to my car.  I told him flat out that I am tired of his attitude and his bully sales tactics and that I will not be guilt-tripped into buying a car from him.  - At that point I left the dealership.  The next day I received an email from Matt saying that he was sorry for the experience and asked me if I still wanted the truck for my asking price. I told him I would take a pass. He then asked what I would say if they took another $500 off my price for the bad experience. I told him I would do it. I went in and Matt said that if I had any issues with the truck I should call him. I asked SPECIFICALLY whether that included an oil leak. He said YES.  What happened next absolutely blew me away...  The ONLY miles I have put on this truck was from the dealer to home, then to a Ford dealership to get another ignition key made. At this point I had found that the windshield wiper fluid did not work and the fog lights did not work. During a very basic inspection Ford made while fixing the wiper fluid and making the key they found an oil leak. So, since Matt said I should call him, I did. He transferred me to Howard who basically said tough - it's a used vehicle and as long as it runs they don't cover it. So basically the "multi-point" inspection they gave the truck didn't cover wiper fluid, the fog lights, and OIL LEAKS! After the LECTURE Howard had given me as to why people pay a premium for a used car at a dealership! Apparently, their "inspection" consists of just seeing if the truck runs!  A complaint has been filed with GM. I am not naive enough to believe a used truck would be perfect, but one would think that an oil leak, wiper fluid spray, and fog lights would be things a dealer would catch and fix BEFORE selling!

After a complaint was filed with GM and the dealership was contacted by dealerrater, I was contacted by the General Sales Manager, George Salman.  At first I was skeptical, as my first impression still had a bad taste in my mouth.  I brought the truck in with my concerns (namely the oil leak that had to have been there before I took it home as well as the fog lights not working).  Mr. Salman could not have been more of a standup and professional individual.  He addressed my concerns and understood where I was coming from.    I wasn't naive enough to believe that a used truck would be perfect, but the issues that I encountered were the exact kind of issues you shouldn't have when purchasing from a dealer.  I wasn't looking for special treatment, only what was honest and fair.  Mr. Salman was more than fair, and it has gone a long way to rectify any ill-will towards Chapman Chevrolet.   NOTE: This would have been a five-star update if every interaction with Howard Thayler, Sales Manager, hadn't been an absolute nightmare.  If you happen to be at the dealership and if he in any way approaches you, simply state you'd like to work with someone else.  I assure you, it will go a long way in improving your experience.

I recently had to cancel my membership to this place.  Overall I had been pleased with the exception of a couple things.  The membership I had included two upgrades a month.  Depending on who was working, that "upgrade" could've meant a few different things.  Overall, inconsistency was a little annoying but tolerable.  I then went to cancel my membership.  It was on hold for a couple of months because I was to be out of town.  When it automatically kicked back in, I was unable to make it into the store in person (as I was still out of town) to fully cancel the membership.  I did make the phone call with days to spare and was promised that a manager would get back to me.  They ended up charging my card.  When I went in person to finish the cancellation, I requested that they reimburse the charge for the month as I was not using it and was promised a phone call to straighten out the issue prior to the charge.  The manager said that at least 30 days notice was required for that.  She brought out the contract and no such agreement was written nor implied.  She was then very rude saying that it was store policy.  I then asked to talk to the owner.  She said she would put me in touch with him and then asked very rudely why he should reimburse me for the month.  I then informed her that an attempt was made to cancel prior to the month starting, I was out of town, and if the charge was not reversed I would simply dispute the charge (ie not pay it anyway) and then write a review on my experience on every review site I could find.  The owner called me personally and was actually very accommodating.  I was very impressed with him.  He said that there would be no problem reversing the charge and anytime I would like to come back I would be welcomed as if the account was just on hold.  That owner's phone call merited a five star review.  The only reason I am putting four stars is due to the unprofessional and rude manager that I had to deal with prior to speaking with the owner.

This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix Metro area.  They play a steady stream of good music and there isn't a bad thing on the menu.    The service has always been great.  Although a bit pricy, the atmosphere can't be beat.   I can't say enough good things about this place.

Very clean, chill atmosphere.    Would have given it 5 star rating if it had a better selection of beer on hand.  Cheers!

I went to this place because I had purchased a Groupon deal that included x-rays, a cleaning, and teeth whitening.  After an hour and fifteen minutes there I am with x-rays, a dental hygienist telling me I need to floss, and no cleaning.  I expected the whitening to happen on a different visit, but not even a cleaning? After over an hour?

While it seems a little pricey compared to other gyms, I feel that it is well worth it.  I have only had good experiences here.  Plenty of equipment, little to no wait time on the machines and weights, and it's open 24 hours which is very helpful for my schedule.    Staff is always friendly and the place is clean with regular updates.  Honestly,  I can't think of a single complaint.

I recently got my bike out of storage and the FI light was coming on.  It was due for the yearly service anyway (which was also performed by Ridenow Goodyear), so I call to make an appointment.  They said they could not perform the service and run the diagnostic for a few days, which was fine by me, and I dropped off the bike.  It wasn't until several days later that the service even got done, at which point they found that the battery was no good.  I had a conversation with them on the phone that explicitly stated that when the new battery was put in, if the FI light cleared DO NOT RUN THE DIAGNOSTIC (as it was an additional $100 or so).  Come to find out they replaced the battery, but they claimed the light was still in so they ran the diagnostic (low and behold it was due to the original battery being bad, and the new one they put in was running at a low voltage because the technician left the key on OVERNIGHT).  So essentially they caused the condition of the FI light, several days AFTER they orginally had said they would get to it.  As I was out of town for a few days when the service was performed, it took a couple extra days for me to be able to come pick it up.  This was explained to the service technician at the time, and this will come into play later.  So after the bill was tallied (which was around $360), I learn that the full yearly service was not performed as was orginally requested (only an oil change).  I also learned at that point why they FI light still came on after the new battery was installed (again, it was THEIR NEGLIGENCE IN LEAVING THE KEY IN THE ON POSITION OVERNIGHT).  And since the required yearly service required an air filter replacement, the service tech said I should bring it back in for that (fat chance there!). Then he proceeded to tell me he was doing me a favor for not charging a storage fee for the bike (despite the fact that the actual service performed didn't happen until days after originally scheduled).  I cannot speak for the sales end of the business, but as far as the service goes I feel they are overpriced, incompetent, and on some level dishonest.  I will NOT be bringing any of my motorcycles to Ridenow Goodyear for service again.

My bill every month is a surprise.  I was originally quoted a specified monthly charge for CenturyLink bundled with DirecTV.  I have yet to see a bill EVEN REMOTELY close to what they originally told me it would be.  I have lost all patience.  I originally went with them when I pricechecked them when my contract was up with Cox.  Since they have no qualms about quoting an inaccurate bill per month, they received my business.  NO MORE!  I have had both Cox and DirecTV.  I cannot stress this enough: IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE, CHOOSE COX OVER DIRECTV!
