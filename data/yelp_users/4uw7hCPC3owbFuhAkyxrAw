Was very surprised just how good the food and restaurant was.  I had never heard of Charleston's, but I am a big fan now. Place gets crowded so plan your meal time with friends around their high traffic.  I will go back as the roast beef was cooked perfectly.

What can I say, its a Waffle House. I have spent a lot of time in these establishments while living in the south and this one in the west is the same.  If you want a good down home meal, this is a great place. No ambiance, but that is not why you go to a Waffle House.

This place looks like it would be good for breakfast, and it is.  Good portions served in a casual atmosphere. Lunch might be good too, but we were there for breakfast and there was NO wait and we were served right a way.  We will be back so I can take a longer look at the menu!

This is a very good Cheesecake Factory. The service was exemplary but Heather was outstanding. Very attentive yet not overbearing. The food was very good. We had Calamari, Endive salad, Ahi Carpaccio. The perfect light dinner. We will be back!

Really surprising good Guadalajara food.  We had the special which was whole Tilapia fried with salad and fries. Could have left off the fries and provided chips, but the fish was excellent!  Also had a couple of shredded beet tacos, very tasty!  Give it a try. Small place, only 10 tables. But quick friendly service.

Stopped by yesterday for lunch. I must admit, for a newbie, it is a bit confusing on how to order and where they seat you. Knowing that you order first and while ordering a guy takes your number and puts it on a table that then becomes yours, would be a bit helpful.    We had the Italia Panini and a pasta caprese salad.  Very nice and the Panini's bread was very tasty and crisp. The place was busy with both families with kids, and young people. It was a bit noisy, but the food and wine made up for it.  Will definitely go back.

One of the best truly local breakfast restaurants I have been to. The belgian waffle was very good as was the chorizo green chili omelette.  Be sure to go early if you want breakfast as the place is very small.  Not sure I would wait outside like most, but I will be back, early in the AM to insure a good seat and some of there yummy food!

Definitely leans more toward the Korean flavors than Japanese. The food was very good and the provided a lot of it! It is a very popular place and can get a bit crowded, but most of the folks there were regulars and all having a good time.  The service was also very good. More like a family serving you than professional waiters.  Very nice from a neighborhood restaurant.  I will be back!

Stopped by for a quick couple of wings and some ice tea. The waitress took our order and sent it off to the kitchen. When the server came out with our order it was completely wrong. The manager came out and did an excellent job of making everything correct and even took 15% off the bill. I like Buffalo wild wing, and I was pleased to see that the manager has the ability to correct things. We are a loyal customer and will continue to go to Buffalo wild wing at McQueen and Elliot!

Recently purchase a Fantex Ash from here and had it delivered yesterday. The tree was amazing and the delivery crew did an awesome job in planting the tree and cleaning up. I highly recommend you shop here when in the market for for outdoor or indoor plants/trees.

I was so hoping to find a good barbecue restaurant near our house. Unfortunately Joe's Real BBQ just misses the mark. The food tasted watery like it had been steamed to keep it moist. Beans & slaw were just average. Cool place inside and is certainly good for families w/ kids.   Wish i could say I will be back, but with so many other great choices, not likely.

Very good NY Italian Food. The quantity of food is ridiculous and you will not go away hungry. The veal piccata is a true representation of Italian food. I would recommend this place for the folks that want Italian and lots of it!!

Went here as a first timer. The reviews are spot on. Food was good and man, a lot of it! Go hungry or be sure to take some home.  The service was fine, but I think they must have hired a new waitress or she got the message from Sophia F.'s comment. The waitress was all alone but managed about 20 guests well. Very friendly and accommodating. My wife and I will definitely return as we both want to try more stuff. My wife had the Gyro sandwich and I had the Gyro platter. Very good.

Stopped by here for the first time for a quick sandwhich. The corn beef was as good as it gets and compared to NY deli's, the quantity was great!  I especially like the "lighter portion" offerings, just in case you aren't really THAT hungry.  Great looking salad bar, which I must try the next time I am there. My hat off to the bus boys. They were very quick and looked to keep our table clean!

My first time at Fox and Hound in the US. Have gone to the one in London and loves it. This place was really good. Great service, tasty food, and reasonable prices. You can eat in the bar or sit sown in the dining room. They also have 3 pool tables which seemed pretty busy. This is a place I will return to!!

I was totally surprised at how good this restaurant is.  I agree with everyone else on the service, decor, and margaritas!  The guacamole made table side was really good and fresh.  However, I really enjoyed my meal as did my dining companion. We had cerviche and Tacos Pescado.  Both were execellent.  i would highly reccomend this restuarant to anyone in the area!

Good Asian food with some interesting twists. We had the calamari and the spicy aioli really went well with calamari serves with both legs and rings. Also had the Ahi katsuo which was delicious. Wish they had hot mustard as it is a nice dip. Wasabi was good and added to the ahi.  We will be back!

If you like Peruvian cuisine, then this little gem is one you will have to try.  The Ceviche was very good with the seafood very fresh.  The little popcorn and dipping sacues that were provided as accompaniement were wonderfule. The Pisco Sour is as good as I have every had.   This is a Lima, Peru cuisine, so if you are expecting something that is not from Lima, then you may be disappointed. However, the food was wonderfule in all respects.  I will go back, hopefully many times as this was one nice surprise.

The tellers at this bank, although friendly, are not very competent. They do not pay attention to anything you write on the check, like the account number on the back. I wish I could find a bank that actually cares about my business.

The agents were VERY friendly, which what I would expect from Hawaiian, but the process is all messed up. You get your boarding pass from the Kiosk, with your bags, then you wait in a VERY crowded space to check your bag. If you have to see an agent for unaccompanied minors or routing changes, you go into another line and wait until there are no bags to check.  This is about as friendly as Spirit Airlines where they don't care about their passengers.  Thank goodness I wasn't flying, just taking a friend.  If I have to check a bag, I will fly someone else, just because of the chaos.

I was very impressed. I have been searching for a good massage since I arrived in the Phoenix area.  I have found such a place in Lifequest.  Shana, the masseuse, was VERY good and understood my muscular issues right away. She treated me properly and I feel much better today than I have in months.  Lifequest will be my new 'goto' establishment for massage and skeleton health.

This was a great place! Thanks to all you Yelpers for giving it such a good rating. I arranged for a business lunch there and was wonderfully surprised. Great waiter, Brooks, took really good care of my colleague and I and the food was perfectly cooked. We ate outside next to the canal on a Patio that was covered. It was beautiful spring day and I will go back with family and friends anytime.  Cheers and Bon Appetite!

I agree with all the other reviews. Wes, the owner, is a honest business person focused on customer satisfaction.  We are new to the Phoenix area and besides trying to find a doctor and a dentist, a car mechanic is a tough search.  Well we are searching no more. Wes will be maintaining both of my vehicles here on out.

You got to love the ambiance in this place. Wish they had a sign so I could have found this place faster. Very cool design of the restaurant. The food looks very good. My partner and I just stopped by for some wine. It is a very cool place to hang out especially if you are a 30 something, which I am not.  I will go back to try the food and more of their wines. I am anxious for a very positive result!

Went in last night to check this place out. The first thing that hits you is the noise as it is a very popular place for the 20/30's crowed.  Also young families have a spot on the patio for the kids. I was having a slight misgiving until I tried their food and hand crafted beer.  I was blown away.  My date and I have the wings (French confit style) and the Green Chile Pork sliders. First, the wings were out of this world. We generally get the dry rub and the kitchen did not disappoint. The meat just falls of the bone and has tremendous flavor. Next we tried the sliders and also were very impressed. Soft pretzel bun with very well cooked pull pork with just enough green chile to make it interesting.  Now the beer.  BTW - no other alcohol is served. Just their beer. My date had the Superstition Coffee Stout which was extremely smooth and not too filling. I had the double Pale which was amber in color and full of flavor.  We will be back, especially when my son visits from Atlanta.  He is a big beer aficionado and will enjoy this place immensely. The food just blew me away and we will also remember to get there early so we can sit outside.

I was really hoping to enjoy this place.  Great location in a modern building. The problem was more with the kitchen than anything else.  Came when there wasn't a crowd and was asked to sit inside or outside. Chose inside and was seated quickly in the middle of a long row of tables.  Waitress was very friendly and the service was quite good. We ordered and waited.  My stepdaughter had the Kobe burger and asked for it to be 'medium', it was rare. My girlfriend asked for the Turkey burger, it was under cooked with a soft white center and had to be sent back to the kitchen. I had the Samburger which as a burger with bacon on it. I asked for it to be medium rare and got it very rare.  I like rare anyway, but not what I had asked for. The buns were nice and soft and the flavor was ok.  On the bright side, the loaded fries were very good, according to my stepdaughter.  There is a lot of new competition in Gilbert and not performing well is not going to help. I am sure other Yelpers liked this place, but it will not be one of my top picks.  I will try it again in a month or two to see if they have fixed their kitchen. I can cook faster and better than these guys. AND, I am not classically trained.
