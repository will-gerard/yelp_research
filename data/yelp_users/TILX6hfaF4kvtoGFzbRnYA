Service was slow as heck. And trust me I've been to heck before. Took about 20 min after ordering to get food and all I ordered were two beef tacos. Food quality was sorta redeeming though. Also closed half the restaurant because they wanted to leave early so it was impossible to find seating.

These pies are really yummy, they bake up in no time at all so they make an easy quick meal for people on the go. Plus, the best part - no thawing needed! A really tasty, flaky crusted all natural alternative to hot pockets with a much much larger variety of types. Only thing I would add is a variety pack or a sampler because for new customers they might not want to commit to a whole bag of one pie type.

Excellent food and service, only thing would be that the portions are a little small for the price
