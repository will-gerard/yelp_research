The first time I went here, everything was absolutely spectacular. No complaints at all.   Went here for the second time, last week and found myself far less satisfied than my first visit. There are not many vegetarian options, which is normally ok for me. I'm not difficult to please. Unfortunately, if I'm ordering a vegetarian dish, I'd really prefer not to find meat in it. This distinctly tainted my views on the place and I will not be going back here.

The pupusas are absolutely delicious! I'm a huge fan of the Bean and Cheese! Also, their rice was spectacular! It's been a long time since I've had a restaurant do rice right! I had the Orchata (which was very different than the Horchata that I'm accustomed to, but still delicious). I have a feeling I'll be trying the Ensalada drink next time.   As for the place, itself, I walked in and was immediately greeted by a person I can only assume was the owner. She was friendly but professional. Once she took my order, she got straight to cooking.   Overall, I was very impressed. This place is definitely going to become one of my regulars!

My goodness! What an experience! I have been long-overdue for a trim, but have been avoiding it at all costs. I normally hate what people do to my hair... but Cutters Cottage has changed my view on hair salons!   I called at 5pm. June answered and got me in for an appointment with Yesenia at 5:30 the same day! I walk in and everyone is super friendly (including the other customers (is that the right word?)), the place is clean, and it is beyond welcoming.   I told Yesenia that I wanted my hair short and that other than that, I just wanted it to look good. Yes, I gave a person I have never met before creative license with my hair. Eeek! By the time I put back on my glasses at the end, I was astonished! It is the best my hair has EVER looked! She worked it so that it was perfect for my face, my body type, and my profession!   I am just beyond impressed and I can't wait to go back!

This place is a complete stoner place... which, as a teacher, makes it tough for me to be in there... but the sandwiches are so dang good, it's impossible to stay away! AMAZING sandwiches!!!

I came to Arizona from Washington and was shocked at the lack of good coffee shops. When I walked into Lux, my desperate search came to a halt. The coffee is spectacular, the people are down to earth, and the bar-area has a great selection of beer!   Basically, if you come from anywhere outside Arizona and are used to great coffee (and the thought of Starbucks appalls you), this is your place. Yes, it is packed and it takes a while to get your drink, but if you can go in an off-hour, it's the perfect place to sit down and enjoy a cup.

I had heard that this place has the best falafel in the valley, so, naturally, I had to check it out. I had recently discovered The Greeks Grill and their amazing falafel, and I had to see if this place could one-up them.   I was beyond excited for the falafel, but when I walked in, I already knew I was in for a letdown. The service was bad from the start; curt, unhelpful, disinterested. We ordered the baba ganoush, which was alright. Nothing special, but we were hungry. The falafel came and I eagerly took a bite, only to have to force the bite down with water. The falafel was bland and not well prepared (resemblant of mush), and they overcompensated with the hummus and pickles to try to make up for the flavor.   Now, I'm sure they prepare some of their food well, given the amount of positive reviews they have from other Yelpers, but I will never be heading back there.  Needless to say, we left and got some yummy food to cleanse our taste buds. Definitely sticking with The Greeks Grill for all further falafel excursions.

Goodness gracious me! I was thoroughly impressed by this place! While the atmosphere is definitely lacking, the food more than makes up for it. I was so very pleased with the rice and potatoes that came with the platters. The falafel was scrumptious! The spanakopita was a bit odd - it seemed to be deep-fried rather than the typical baked version that I'm used to. Still very good, though.   I will be stopping by here again!

Warning: this is a bit of a novel... To get to the parts about the food and service, skip to the end... If you want to hear the story, read on.  This place is beyond ridiculous. My friend and I walk in after a race, are greeted by the owner, and a nice mother and daughter immediately start recommending items for us.   My friend orders the chorizo breakfast and I the falafel pita (naturally). I am always very skeptical about ordering falafel because so many places just don't get it right. It's either been frozen, it's too greasy, or too dry. So, as you can tell, I was nervous.   The owner is super friendly when taking our order and just made us feel as though we were at home. We talk to the other patrons in the restaurant for a while (it really says something that extremely friendly, intelligent people eat here), and then go take our seats outside. The woman cooking the good brings us out two of the most amazing plates of food I've seen in a while, and the owner follows her with the forks, airing us that the food is freshly made and that he hopes we enjoy it.  We dig in, and oh my goodness. The chorizo had the perfect amount of spice (according to my friend), and the falafel... oh, the falafel. It was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Just perfect! I have never enjoyed falafel that thoroughly; every bite was just a little piece of heaven.   After finishing our meal, I had to step back inside to compliment the owner on the falafel, to which he responded by showing us just how truly fresh it is. They make a huge batch of it from scratch every day! I was so impressed by the quality and by how he made me feel right at home.  I thought things  couldn't get better, but as we were walking out, he wanted to make sure we had enough water since we had just run a race. Talk about a wonderful human being!  I'll definitely be coming back here!

This place is pretty darn impressive. I went here on a date and was happy to find that the atmosphere encouraged getting close to a person and being cozy.   I was impressed with the movies that they were playing on the TVs. You know a place is good when they're playing The Princess Bride and The Fifth Element.   As for the price, the drinks were pretty expensive. I'm a beer drinker and I was very happy that my date was paying. There is no way that I would be able to afford multiple drinks at this place.

I went here the other night with my girlfriends for a girl's night out... and boy, was this the right place to go! It was $20 for a bottle of wine and 4 different types of bruschetta... all which were delicious! I didn't think they'd have many vegetarian versions, but they had a bunch! And they were ALL spectacular! You'd think that you wouldn't get a good wine with a deal like that, but the riesling was perfect!  My mom is coming to town this week, and this is one of the first places we'll be going!

Had to write another review for this place just to make sure to keep it current and honest.   Went here with my mom this past week because I loved this place so much before. At first, we went over to the Arcadia location (closer to where I live), but it seemed much snootier than the Central location, so we drove an extra couple of minutes to get there.   Again, the food was spectacular. This time, though, we had an amazing waitress who made the whole experience an absolute blast.   Recommendation: Call ahead by about half an hour so you don't have to deal with the outrageous wait.

This place is absolutely delicious! I was raised on Mediterranean food, so I'm extremely picky... so when I took that first bite of falafel, I was in heaven! It was then followed by some of the most spectacular hummus I've ever experienced (that uses exceptional olive oil), and the baklava... scrumptious!   Along with the food being as great as it is, the service is wonderful! The lovely people there were so friendly and wonderful!   This is definitely going to be my go-to place!

When I first arrived in Arizona, this was the first restaurant that I went to. I was very impressed and went back many times over the following 3-4 months. Unfortunately, a few months ago, something changed about the food. I don't know why things changed, but the quality went downhill. My favorite enchiladas suizas were tasting a little bland... or every once in a while, too spicy to consume. This just got inconsistent. I tried going back a few more times over the past three months to see if it was just a rough patch, but I haven't seen any improvement.

Delicious food! The waitress was beyond nice and even demonstrated how to eat the food. It was my first time eating Ethiopian food, and I wish I had watched a YouTube tutorial on how to properly eat the food. It's difficult! (Really. Go find a tutorial before you try this).   Will definitely be going back here!
