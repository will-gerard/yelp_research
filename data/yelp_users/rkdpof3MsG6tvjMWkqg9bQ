We called in our order at 8:15, they stop taking orders on Monday at 8:30. We were picking up pur order, two lg burritos,  2 street tacos, 2 sides of guacamole and chips.   They currenty were quite busy in the dining area and 10 ppl were behind us in line. The service was quick and friendly. Isereal the manager was awesome!  The food is great too!  I definitely recommend Lulu's!

Quaint and sweet. Service is great and so is there food. The menu is quite large and can be overwhelming but so far EVERYTHING  that I have ordered from it has been so delicious.  I recommend this place with a five star rating!

Not impressed.  Service was fine. Food was less than mediocre.  Chef In back did not wear gloves when stuffing peppers a d wiping face then stuffing peppers. Bathroom smelled like sewer. Sewer drain partially open and in hall, water was coming out of wall.
