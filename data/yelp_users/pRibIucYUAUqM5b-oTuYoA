Why can't I rate them LESS than 1 star? I always dread contact Cox because you always wait forever only to be transferred to another service person and then another service person. My call that I just completed, approximately 75 minutes and 3 service reps later, resulted in Cox reducing my monthly invoice amount by approximately 10% but it is still at least double what I will pay with a competitor. And, that is not considering using Netflix, Amazon, etc. Time for Cox to re-define themselves or close the doors.

This company is the VERY WORST company in the USA and probably the world! Their customer service is horrendous....just barely worse than their service. I have major issues with their email system and cannot get anyone with ANY intelligence to address the issue. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST COMPANY!!!! I cannot wait for the company to go under because of their extremely poor service!  I am converting all email, etc. to another email provider. There are WAY TOO MANY quality service providers to continue to endure this type of horrible service. Additionally, I will be following the path of many others. Cancel CABLE. Cancel Internet service. GET COX OUT OF MY LIFE!!!  TOO LONG have we had to endure this terrible company and it horrible service!  Adios!!!!

Absolutely awesome. This is one of my regular places. Always consistently good with friendly, smiling staff. Family owned and run, one cannot ask for a more friendly place with outstanding food.   I have been frequenting Saigon Nites on a regular basis for at least two years and have never been disappointed with the food or the service. And it is consistent regardless of the day of the week or the time of day.   Note: closed on Sundays.

If you are like me, I TOTALLY depend on my laptop for "everything" and feel totally lost without it. Being a business owner, REALTOR(R) and State Designated Broker, with an active team of real estate agents communicating with me, in addition to the company business, I heavily rely on my laptop. And, nothing makes me feel quite as vulnerable as having problems with my laptop. In fact, it is almost like being ill, I have to be REALLY REALLY ill to visit a doctor, And, it is the same with my laptop,  After suffering for weeks with an "ill" laptop, I finally went to "Doctor" Mike - and, in a very short period of time (minutes - not hours, or days or weeks), Mike was able to diagnose the problem. He was also very sensitive to my "handicap" and turned around the repair within hours.  I was ready to purchase a new laptop. In fact, I had another "expert" tell me the "mother board" appeared to be bad and would need replacing. I told Mike that I could purchase another computer very quickly - especially if his repairs would be costly or if he felt my laptop (approx. 2.5 yrs old and running Windows 7) was outdated and needed replacing.  Not only did Mike discourage me from purchasing a new laptop (that he could sell me), he also told me that my laptop was in good condition.  I feel I received a very honest, up-front evaluation AND Mike, and his team, delivered on exactly what they told me they would do.  I am EXTREMELY pleased with Mike's services and will be using him in the future - just hopefully not too soon!  THANK YOU, Mike and your team, for rescuing me!

The best of the best... The menu Is varied so one can order bar-style food or lunch or dinner. Bartenders make great drinks and have a nice selection of wine. Staff is very friendly. This place is as close to your "Cheers" environment as one can get. Nice outdoor dining, family style dining, private tables and bar seating allows one to select their individual preference. This is the perfect place for entertain business guests, friends and/or family.

Still the best of the best. It has become the standard by which all others are measured. I love the environment, the staff, the food and the drinks!  Home Sweet Home!  I had the shrimp and grits tonight with a Tito's martini. Loved it! And, their house special dessert tonight, apple pie a la mode was fantastic.

Horrible customer service. Truly a disgrace. When can we do away with banks and stupid cashiers and completely bank online? Why do banks limit the funds that you can electronically deposit? And then you take a check to a cashier - who is on a personal phone call and you have to wait for him to finish the call to actually do his job - he then takes forever looking at the check for deposit. So inefficient. So unfriendly.

This place has great Thai food with really good, friendly service. A family operation, they really pay attention to their clients and make their clients feel as if they are guests enjoying a family meal.   Food quantity is large. Definitely watch the spice level. Level 5 is Thai hot, hot, hot and really for the very serious spice lover. A word to the wise....  The fish cakes are some of the best around.   This is definitely one of my regular places!
