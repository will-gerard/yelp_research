I just completed a 7 month project remodeling a 95 year old home on the central coriddor. Michael at Clyde Hardware was my sole source for Baldwin locks for my home inside and out. They have the greatest selection, knowledge and service I have seen in the industry.

I used them for my built in BBQ grille and could not be happier. Ramiz my salesman is very special and really gets the job done. Now for the best part, we also bought two sets of fireplace gas logs. I wanted the remote operated ones and he advised me against it. But I ordered anyway ! What do you know 4 months later they quit working. At my choice the gladly exchanged for the non remote logs. Ramiz is the best.

I am a professional realtor and just had the experience of dealing with this company and would NOT recommend them.

Even then they did not complete the drawing showing a thorough treatment as required by the state.

I have been working out 4-5 times per week and was not getting the results I desired while using LA Fitness and Orange Thery Fitness. I made the decision to find a private trainer to take my fitness and body to a better level. I interviewed and had a session with a fine master trainer at LA Fitness and liked the session but in the middle of a big gym like that I was a spectical and did not like everyone watching. I visited Vitality and and other gym and interviewed the system they offered. Then I went to Jason at FIIT and the deal was done. He is a great and skilled trainer in a perfect boutique gym. He set up a nutrition and fitness plan and I am one week into the system and have lost 5 pounds from 171 19% body fat to 166 with 17% body fat. My goal is 160 and 12% and feel he can get me there.Todays workout was painful and a killer but thats what it will take. I would highly recoomend Jason and David.

I have a home with 23 large windows all with many individual panes. So they are a lot of work and at 2 stories as well. I have used two other window cleaners in the past and would give them each 3 stars. But Dave came for the first time today and cleaned the inside and outside remarkably. I mean it they have never been done this carefuly and completely. He comes well equipped and I would recommend him. I will also use him again in 6 months. Thanks Dave

I think this is a top three pizza place in the valley. But number UNO for Italian decor . Back to the pizza, have it your way thin or thick and every topping you want. The red sauce is on the home made sweeter side but I love it!

OMG the greatest pizza ever! My favorite pizza spot for a custom thin crust perfecto pie! The facility is beautiful and the drinks are great . Too bad they have Pepsi and not Coke!

Our second time here and again it was amazing. Very intricate veggies and meats. The grilled octopus soup was fantastic. Best of all they have a drink mixologist .

Simple order at the counter mexican affair. The tortillas are fresh and homemade! The chips ate also fresh and homemade... The salsa is fantastic... Next time i will order a chicken quesadilla. Really like this small family owned place!

Very well done new place with patio. We had a nice dinner experience with Salmon and thought it was done as ordered. The beer selection is good as well.

Spicy homemade modern Mexican food with really amazing sauces and salsas. The chicken enchiladas were fantastic, but if you want sweet and very spicy try the diablo shrimp.

Really disappointing experience. Cute place but noisy. The bacon was good and the costa burrito was good. The hash browns were undercooked. Out first and last time!

They did a big job for me two years ago now. The pavers are holding up great too. The project was complex with step, circle driveway, tree rings, landscape edge and they did a great job as designed by them. I would use them again.

Great space. Very dramatic. Food was really good. Potstickers were excellent with a crispy crust. Dynamite chicken was flavorful with the right combination of sweet and spicy.  Service was great. Worth trying. I'd go back

I went to the large orthopedic medical practice for a second opinion on the SI joint issue I was having. The place is very large and very nice and is certainly setup to handle volumes of patients. But the have a great flow and system and the PA I saw did a thorough examination and concurred the previous diagnosis and treatment method. I think this is a very good practice.

I was so excited to give this local new place a try. The place is dark and urban but well done. The food was so average and they do not offer fish tacos... What a blunder.

The patio seating was very hip and the place is cool. Music is on trend but rather loud I thought. The food is tapas style and delicious. The sea bass, steak and corn were fantastic. We will be back.

I used them to change the felt on my pool table and they did a more than perfect job. They were on time and professional and I recommend them highly.

Our first time but not our last... Chicken Suiza Enchiladas were amazing!  Not to creamy or large a plate. The Chorizo on top was really spicy and savory and I loved it. I ordered a santan beer but it was not cold. We will be back.

The worst meal I have had in ages. I ordered a skyy and soda with orange bitters and they added salt to the rim? Really... It was awful. The chicken katsu was so over cooked is was dead and got stuck in my throat. The pasta was undercooked and COLD Nobody checked on us either. We will never return.

First of all the facility is great! We ordered $13 burgers that were thinner than McDonalds...Really dry and expensive but the bread was good. We ordered iced tea which were $5 each and nothing special. We will not be back.

I am very disappointed. Our friends said it was good but not tonight. Beef ribs were flavorful but came out cold. The Ocotillo chicken came out cold as well. The pasta was just ok.

I had the miso salmon over farrow and green beans and it was the best salmon I can remember!  They have a great whiskey menu and mine was made perfectly. The crab cakes were beautiful and fantastic, my only suggestion would be to ask for more sauce.

Our first time here and loved the place. The croquettes were perfect, chicken and dumplings were not typical but were delicious. The chicken and sausage gumbo was very New Orleans and we loved it. The wine pours were very stingy...

I finally had the fried chicken and it was hit and spicy. I loved it and the coating was crunchy and well seasoned. The bread pudding is as good as it gets too!

Did nothing for us. Very limited healthy but expensive menu. The chicken salad sandwich was very average but the sweet potato chips and ice tea were good. The lobster cob salad was just average as well.
