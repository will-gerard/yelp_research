Culinary Adventure #2 in Phx went MUCH MUCH better than #1.   This is a place my dad frequents, and kept talking about all day so I was eager to give it a shot. As we were driving up I noticed it was in a stripmall-esque area and I was like "Daaaad...why always the strip mall places". But as soon as we got in - definitely a different atmosphere than I expected. The front area is a decent bar and a waiting area; the TV in the corner was showing the ASU/UofA Bball game. There were about 4 tables full in there but it was after 8pm on a Wednesday so, I didn't hold that against them at all.   Everyone knew my dad and greeted our table with warm smiles. Some quips about the Cards and we ordered; my dad pretty much knew what was good so we went with that.   Bread was awesome - a nuttier bread which I am always a fan of. Get the garlic butter to spread on - mmmm. We got a 'special' meal that my dad concocted that he's evidently had there numerous times - grilled (not breaded) eggplant, and a side of penne with peppers/mushrooms in an al diavolo sauce. Very good. The sauce was especially spectacular.   The service was nice - attentive yet not intrusive. Best. After clearing our plates and bringing out dessert, they brought over some amaretto on the rocks 'to wash down our meal'. What a nice touch!  I had nothing bad to say about this place, except for I don't think people know much about it since it's tucked into a stripmall next to (I think) a dry cleaner or some other inane business. Highly recommended and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Phx!

Flies!! Everywhere!! Enough that it does not make me feel like this is an anomaly this morning. Not a relaxing experience when those mf'ers are up in my face.   Would be understandable/acceptable if we were in a tropical climate.  We are in Madison, WI.  2 stars only bc people seem nice and ambiance (sans flies) is nice.

I've been to the place in NYC - oh no wait...I've gone to the place and have been deterred by the 2 hour line more than once. Very frustrating when all you want is to treat your out of town guests to some really amazing pizza! So when we walked by this place while cruising downtown Scottsdale, I was surprised to learn they had locations outside of the one busier-than-all-F place under the Brooklyn Bridge. So my dad and I gave it a shot.   Now I've had (several, actually) discussions with the bf on what constitutes good pizza (it's VERY subjective, but still there are universal goods and bads). And I think I can unequivocally say, this is awesome pizza! The coal-fired taste is scrumptious. It came out hot - we had onions and mushrooms. The mozz cheese was great - not rubbery, not greasy, just delicious.   We also had a small salad (the waitress tipped us off that a small was enough for 2 ppl - thanks for that! - she was right and saved us $3 and a lot of wasted salad). The salad was basic, good, and the dressing was yummy. And a half-carafe of red wine was was definitely enough for both of us (full from earlier drinks).   ONE complaint would be there isn't enough sauce (whatever sauce there was, it was tasty, but could have used 50% more!). Other than that, at $30-ish for the entire meal (!!!) I can say my dad will definitely be back since he lives there, and I will put my full support behind that! :)

My dad and I came here just to grab a pre-dinner drink and ended up having a snack too. What a trendy/chic place! It felt very NYC (as I learned later, it has a sister restaurant in NYC). I loved the ambiance - very high ceilings, fun lighting, huge mirrors on the wall, and funky seating.   We sat in what I called the 'date booth' which was a funny red couch in the middle of the place - perfectly appropriate for just grabbing a drink, but it would definitely be awkward for having dinner. After purusing the cocktail list I was delighted to see a number of interesting cocktails, dubbed 'classic cocktails', and each had the cocktail's inventor and date of invention. I love that stuff! I settled on a Saint Germain (with elderberry liquor - I had it at a party once and loved it!) and dad got a caiparinha. We also got the flatbread (sans bacon).   Both the cocktails were a delight. Dad's caipirhina came with rock candy !!!!! and mine tasted like bubble gum (in a good way). The flatbread was also tasty, especially once we put some AZ hot sauce on top!  $40 incl tip for 2 cocktails and an app, a bit pricey but we did get expensive cocktails. The menu didn't look too bad though, $-wise.  note: bathrooms are cool too. hard to locate though! very camo.

I'm in Phx this week to visit the male parental unit. I couldn't wait to get some good Mexican food in during my visit, because we all know what extremely limited selection there is on the East Coast. Upon Yelping it, I was surprised to see how low many of the Mexican places were rated in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area! I settled on this place out of convenience and it had the least fluctuation in ratings.   Now there were 4 of us vegetarians here, and I did not for a second think this would be an issue. Mexican food is probably one of the easiest to make "vegetarian-ish", and most places I have been to have several veggie options on the menu. Not so for this place!! The only veggie entree on the entire menu was chille relenos, and they were able to concoct cheese enchiladas and a 'veggie plate' (which we did not end up getting, why would we pay all that money for a plate of vegetables!?).   Between the 4 of us, we got a large order of guac, 2 cheese enchiladas, and a chille relenos. My dad and I each got Patron Silver magaritas too. Here's the breakdown:  Great: -The guac was superb and I would attribute one of the stars just to that. I love guac anyways though, so it's really difficult to rate poorly for me. -The enchiladas were also great and you could tell the tortillas were homemade - yum!!  Good: -Margaritas. Pretty good, and pretty strong (had only 1/2 of mine and could feel it!). Tasty marg mix. -Patio with heat lamps was a fun ambiance, although it looked a bit chaotic (too many chairs at our table, heat lamps scattered all over the place, etc). -Accoutrements such as black beans, rice, and veggies. Standard fare, decent taste.  Meh: -The chille relenos were bleh. Soggy in their sauce, and really really cheesy (like too much so. tasted rubbery.) -Salsa that came with the chips was not that good! That's usually one of my fave parts about Mexican restaurants is the fresh and delish salsa. Not so with this place!  Double Meh:  -Service!! Sheesh the place wasn't THAT busy it was a Tuesday night, but after our waitress took our order we didn't see her at all, even after we had already asked for more chips and salsa and my dad had asked for habenero salsa (he has taste bud issues in that he has none). It practially took my round-ish dad flying out of his seat and tackling the waitress in order to have her come by again just so we could *remind* her of what we had already asked for 10 minutes earlier! And we could tell when the food came out that it may have been sitting there for a bit; it was just meh warm not piping hot as it should have been.  -Price. I thought for this meal, $105 (incl tip) was a bit ridiculous, especially since the cheese enchiladas, while they were good, were just glorified quesadillas (which were $5.95 on the app menu).   Wouldn't go back here, but we did leave full (mainly due to chips/salsa/guac).

The tom yum soup (w/tofu) in the fire bowl was out of this world!! I had never had tom yum served like this. Give me this and a side of rice (I like to throw rice in there for more substance and to decrease the surface area of my tongue affected by the spicy soup) and I can die spicy happy in love.   XOXOX TOM YUM!
