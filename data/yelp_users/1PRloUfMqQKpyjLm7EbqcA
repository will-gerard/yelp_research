Yet another bank that just flat out sucks!!    Tried to talk..tried to be upfront and honest    The account managers are complete assholes  Nobody fucking listens anymore   Nobody fucking cares!!   I hope every single person in this bank gets into a accident like i did!!!  Then maybe you low life fucks will have a grain of EMPATHY!!!   Seriously    Low life scum to work for a bank

Horrible!!!!!  Got super bad service about a month ago  Literally got sent a pizza that had been sitting cooked for over 45 min!!!    A manager named Elijah called and promised stuff  Never received a credit or charge back   I tried to call and order a pizza right now On. Monday night at 9pm And the person taking the order told me its gonna be at least a 45 min wait before it can go out  I explain I recently had a problem and ask for the manager...she said Elijah wasn't in  I let them know id be calling back   I'm disabled..and on limited funds...  These POS losers need to quit so some hard working people can get the job  I'm sick of lazy losers!!!!!!!

I write a constructive review on this place   The owners must of cried bigtime to yelp because they deleted it  What a joke   This location always serves undercooked or overcooked chicken  The location is super difficult to get into  The drive thru is crazy around lunch time..blocks half of the parking lot   The 3 different times i have been here the $2 cookies were hard and not soft   Ive given this location 5 different chances and its always something bad   They need to learn from other chic fil a...   I dont know what the problem is here but the management/owners. Do not care about this customer  2nd time posting a review here..  See my original review on google.   :)   PS..instead of management/owners tryin to contact me directly...they try to get my reviews taken down... Pretty pathetic..  Shame on YELP!!!!!!   This is supposed to be for the consumers

Stay away from this place  Bigtime gougers!!!!  I just called in for a price!!!  They refused to sell the part alone   Only gave 1 price of $279 to replace a LG G5 screen  I even was very upfront and honest ..first explaining that I was on disabilty and money is tight...2nd that I can swap the part myself..I have the skill and tools  They again refused to sell or do anything ...I said I'm gonna have to order online ..as the part is only $100-144 tops shipped.   The kid on the phone said ok..  Lets see how long a business like this can last for.  I can call my insurance company and have the entire phone replaced for 200...why would I waste my money supporting a business that doesn't care about its customers   So instead of moving product..helping a customer..thry just earned themselves a bad review here on yelp and Google maps  Guess it makes more sense to sit on inventory ..."ps the person on the phone even verified they has the part in stock"    Do urself a favor..before bringing in your phone.. Watch a YouTube video on repair of your phone
