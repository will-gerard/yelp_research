This place has a little bit of everything. They bring you bread and a salad like an Italian restaurant and the sushi is delicious!  Located in a Small shopping center but very warm atmosphere inside.

Went for restaurant week, first the menu online shows that they offer the exotic mushroom pan fry as one of the options. We find out after getting there that it costs an extra $10 for it. The dessert was cold and after asking that the waiter warm it up, he brought out a new plate of the same desert and it was still cold. Poor service, food really was sub-par for what we paid. There's plenty of great restaurants in this area, I'd try somewhere else.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this company. I have used their monthly cleaning service for nearly a couple years now and they do a great job every time. The cleaning crew is detailed, they do a fantastic job of taking care of special requests, and I feel safe having them in my home. The owner, Mark, is outstanding. He does a great job of taking care of his customers. This is by far one of my favorite bills to pay each month because I love what I get for my money.

After canceling their service over 2 months ago because I moved and calling several times to request my credit balance be mailed out to me, I find out that they transferred my balance to someone else's account!   Very incompetent, please consider better options before Cox.

The reviews don't lie, this place is fantastic!!! Barry runs the store and is one of the most knowledgable and courteous people I have met. I picked up 2 beautiful suits for an amazing price, it's simply unbeatable.

Fantastic Pho and service. I went during off hours so it wasn't busy, not sure how things are during busy hours.   Staff was very knowledgable too.

Freddy Mitchell is the man! Super courteous and did a fantastic job with my windshield. Blue Chip was a pleasure to deal with from start to finish.   I even had an exposed wire to a dash cam that Freddy was nice enough to tuck behind a panel for me. What a guy! 10/10 would recommend to anyone.

Great place to get a regular car wash. It's fast, good quality and the unlimited car wash is the business.  Matt at the Chandler location is the man!

Went here for dinner with my girlfriend, the food is amazing and service is excellent. The veg starters are a great way to kick off a dinner packed with great spices.

Had the bourbon cherry sausage with rosemary potatoes and eggs and it was unreal good! Service was friendly, prompt, and the waiters had  good personality.   If you're a jam lover the strawberry is well worth the price to pick one up.

Amazing cocktails! Not a good place to go to grab a beer or a quick drink but man, if you like cocktails and novel drinks this spot is a good time.

Went here to try something new and had a bad experience but the pizza was great. The guy making my pizza had to ask me 4 separate times what I ordered which was mildly annoying but not a big deal. Then I noticed that he forgot what the guy in front of me ordered and put the wrong toppings on his pizza.   They were all out of basil too which was an ingredient on two of the three pizzas that I ordered. I would have hoped the guy making the pizzas would tell me they were out of basil when I ordered instead of after the pizza was made.   I felt they deserved three stars since the pizza was good (even without the basil) and the price seemed reasonable. The people however could use some help.

Jason is one of the best guys you could buy a bike from. He's knowledgable, honest, and fun to talk with. I went in to buy a bike and he personally took me out on several test rides to make sure I picked the one that was best for me. Great experience. The coffee and artwork is good too!

Good quality sushi that's surprisingly inexpensive. The rotating sushi bar has a fun atmosphere and good service as well.

The food is unreal good but Hannah is one of the best waitresses my GF and I have had in a while! Ask for her when you check this place out and make sure she gives you her "top 5" recommendations.
