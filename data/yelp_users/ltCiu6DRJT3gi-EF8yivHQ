For being STARK empty at 8:10pm, it shouldn't have taken until 8:38 for me to get a sandwich and soup to go. Didn't help that they forget to put in the order to actually make my sandwich. VERY inattentive staff for being a not-so busy place.   As for my food, typical Jewish deli sandwich with toooooooo much meat. Matzo ball chicken soup was good. I'll pass on Chompie's next time. Not worth my time...literally.

Thank goodness for Yelp! This was such a great find. I had a looooong day at work, missed lunch, and was starving on my way back to my hotel. Stopped in to place an order to go. The hostess was UBBER friendly! I mean, I wasn't even at a table so didn't need waiter service, but they were so nice! Offered my water while I waited and overall just really nice staff.  Now onto the food: I was a little disappointed in the sushi/roll options. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that I did order to-go and maybe they had more options at the sushi bar that I wasn't privy to, but from the menus, there was much. I settled on my go-to safe choice rainbow roll, seaweed salad, and salmon dinner. Told you I was hungry! The roll was great, but hey, it's a simple standard roll. My fav was the salmon. It was a nice piece of fish, almost like they skinned it right off of Nemo! Even had the skin on it, which I actually like. Came with salad, rice, and miso soup, which I thought smelled a little funny in the car ride, but it was VERY tasty!   I did think the food was slightly pricey, but hey, most sushi places are. I will certainly be back to Hiro and this time dine-in. Thanks Yelp!

Stopped in for a few items while waiting for my to-go order from Hiro's Sushi across the street. Talk about a liquor selection! WOW! I didn't even come in for alcohol or buy any, but I couldn't help be amazed by the selection. For a grocery store, this place could battle BevMo! Kinda pricey prices, but clean market with friendly smiles and service.

Um, yeah, not what I was expecting at all. Honestly, the meat patties where really thin. I'm glad I ordered a double because I woulda been like that old lady in the back-in-the-day Wendy's commercial: "Where's the beef?".

If you stay in the winter, bring a blanket! Sheets/comforters are thin & the heaters seem to only know how to turn off or blow cold air. I realize it's AZ, but that doesn't mean it never gets cold! The 2 occasions I stayed here, I could not for the life of me get the heat to work. Even called the front desk both times and it didn't help. Still was a rather chilly sleep. Brrrrrr...  Pretty thin walls. If you have a suit, close the bedroom doors for some peace n quiet.  Extemely courteous staff! Very nice!  :-)

Short and sweet - worth every single cent! Guest service is extremely helpful and friendly. I traveled with some friends and we booked our reservations separately and they were so nice at check in to try to get our rooms on the same floor or close to each other.   Had lots of luck at the slot machines. Concierge will even add your name to the guest list for Tao so you can enter for free as a guest. Everything about this hotel rocks. From here on out, I will ONLY stay at the Venetian or Palazzo.

OMG, sooooo overrated. Granted yes, we got in for free as hotel guests, but the place was so packed and the music was just eh. Drinks were pretty good, priced right, good amount of liquor. Decor was nice, cool ambiance.   However, enter with caution: There's no space on the dance floor to dance, and if you stand anywhere else they (security) keeps asking you to move. WTF??? We spend the entire night being forced to walk around the club with our drinks just to dance...which we actually didn't really get to do. I felt like a herd of cattle! I don't know man. The ONLY way I would go back is if we did bottle service. This way I could at least enjoy myself. Otherwise, not worth my outfit and shoes!

Pretty cool place - decent HH. Smirnoff Shakers for $3 and good portion appetizers for 1/2 off. I got the cod sliders and this was a good amount of food! The fish was really tasty, not some bland piece of frozen fish sticks! I'd totally go back next time I'm in town.

To keep it simple...  I live in LA and am in the process of coming up with a master plan to have their pizza delivered to me on a weekly basis. I'm talkin that dayum good!  GO. RUN. NOW.

(This review is mainly on the rooms, not the casinos or restaurants).   Having grown up in LA, a 3-4 hour drive from Vegas, I've seen my share of Vegas hotels. But after staying that on 2 separate occasions at the Palazzo and Venetian, hands down, I will NEVER stay at another hotel again! This place is the bomb. It just screams elegance. The room/suites are amazing! Sunken living rooms, 3 flat screen TVs including 1 in the bathroom. And the beds were oh so soft and cozy - defiantly calls you after a drunken night out.   This hotel is basically the sister hotel of the Venetian, so it looks pretty much the same, with the same amenities inside, just "looks" a bit newer.   My 1 and only con - the pool is between both hotels, which meant that you've got 2 fairly tall hotels blocking the sun. Other than that, it's worth the stay!

Woohoo! We partied allllll night like it was 1999! This show is F-A-B-U-LOUS! We went for a bachlorette party. Picture it: 1 bride to be+9 ladies+Prince+Jerome+lots of Purple nipples (the drink!) = one fun night! Not only did all the performers looks and sound like the real thing, they really put on an awesome show!   We watched the one at House of Blues in Mandalay Bay. Show starts at 9:30ish, and at first I thought, wow, this is gonna be a quick show. Boy I was wrong! They performed for about 1 1/2 hours and then had like a 45 minute intermission where a DJ came on and played all the jams (and not just Prince music, but club/dance music)! Then they came back out again, performed for another hour or so, then the night ended with more DJ and dancing. We didn't leave till after 1, drunk as hell and so happy we got in some dancing too (which we weren't expecting!).   Extra bonus - madd cheap! The show is free for locals (with ID) or $10 pp. We got a few of those coupon booklets out of the taxi cabs and there was a BOGO coupon. So the 10 of us all got in for $25 - talk about a steal! I woulda paid the full $10 anyhow cuz it was that good.   All Prince fans, make a stop at this show. Just as good as the real thing!

This is basically the "Panera Bread" of AZ IMO. Great mac 'n cheese. Yummy sandwiches and a great massive customizable salad bar. And it's a pretty large space with lots of seating and menu options.

One image comes to mind when I think about this hotel: Miley Cyrus 2013 VMA Performance!  This place is a comical, crazy fun, madhouse! So much to see and do and hear. It's a sure win for sensory overload! Definitely not for the demour or siddity types, or those coming to Vegas for peace and quiet.

In high school, we had a friend with the initials K.J. We jokingly used to call her "Kill Joy" cuz sometimes she would, well, kill the joy! That's what imma call Big Daddy's - a big fat effin KILL JOY.  Kill Joy #1: Phoned in an order around 8pm on a Monday evening. Showed up about  20 mins later to a huge place that was stark empty. Literally, only 1 table with 2 people in the entire place. I was in Scottsdale for work so I had never been here before and I didn't know where you're supposed to stand to pick up to-go orders. I went up to the front of this empty place, BUT waited 5 whole mins before someone even said hello or offered to help me. Really? Everyone was too busy in an empty restaurant? Hmmmm...  Kill Joy #2: Ordered the 2-meat combo meal with tri-tip and pulled pork. The meat. Wow this meat was delish! Didn't even need a knife to cut it. Tender, full of flavor, and a very decent portion. BUT it came with 4 fatty slabs of RAW onions on the side. Why???? It wasn't a sandwich. And anyone that knows me knows I hate those things. It doesn't say on the menu it comes with onions so why would think to request my food without them. The funk entered my meat and the whole room. Ewww.  Kill Joy #3: Got a side of "mixed veggies". BUT, it was some dry ass zucchini and squash strips not even seasoned properly. They literally threw these things in the oven to warm 'em up and tossed a few handfuls of Lawry's seasoning salt on em after. Eck! Not my idea of seasoned mixed veggies.  Kill Joy #4: Was feeling like a fatty, so also wanted to try their sweet potato fries. Not too bad! A little sweet, a little salty, good combo. BUT they were cold!!!! How do you serve cold food?!?! Come on, now!  I won't be back to Big Daddy's "KJ" BBQ. Unless I'm in a good mood and for some reason prefer to be in a bad mood.
