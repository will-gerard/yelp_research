Food was average at best but the worst part was the poor customer service. When we asked for condiments the waiter made us feel like we were asking too much and reacted to us in a manner that he didn't want to be bothered. In addition, they do not offer a military discount. Date 7/5/15 time 1:45pm.

After I posted my 2 star review, I was surprised and happy to get a message from the management. They ask if I would like a call to discuss the issue and I accepted their offer. Unfortunately, I never got the call. The customer service continues to be lacking with poor follow through.

Excellent service and the food was top notch. We had the steak medallions, very very tender and the Salmon. Both were high quality.

This place caters to the customer. The location is a huge facility and they get your car done while you wait. The facility has free coffee, WIIFII and lots of places to sit while waiting for your car. I usually do not like taking my car to the dealer to get fixed but this is the exception. I always deal with David Fleischman and always request Daniel Smith to do the actual work. David always gives the highest customer service and Daniel is a wizard when it comes to making sure my car is in tip top shape........

The service was excellent. The owners come by to make sure you are being taken care of. The waitress was very upbeat and attentive. The California eggs benedict was a great choice!

Being a family owned yoga studio makes the vibe relaxed and welcoming.  All the classes that I took where great.  Instructors were comfortable with teaching and were very knowledgeable in their craft.  The well thought out and artistic decoration set the tone for my yoga experience. I enjoyed the owners as well as the instructors and look forward to taking some more classes.

An australian theme place with a real nice atmosphere. The staff was very attentive and pleasant. I ordered the pulled pork, ostrich, kangaroo sliders, crocodile pot stickers, bruschetta and the beef and guinness stew. All the food was excellent and my personal favorite was the Stew. One of the owners "Raul" was very pleasant, he made sure everyone in the place was taken care of.  The prices were extremely fair considering the high quality of food and service.

9/13/15 3:07pm Just left, this store had terrible customer service  The store was full of employees unwilling to assist customers. The vibe I got was they did not want to work.

I was in a bind. I had an appointment with a carpet cleaning company that did not show up after I was prepared for them and had already moved all my furniture. I called around and was referred to this company. Justin was able to fit me into his schedule same day. The carpets came out excellent and I even had him steam clean my couches which he did an immaculate job. Justin is very personable and his customer service and attention to detail is top notch  If you want great service by a company that cares about the type of service they provide, pick this one

Rob and his company were not able to clean my carpets since I needed them cleaned same day and Rob was booked. With that said, Rob took time out of his day to refer me to a company that was able to assist me in getting my carpets cleaned the same day  I give this company a 5 start rating for two reasons 1. Going out of their way to make sure I got the service I needed even though they would not be making a financial profit from it and 2. Referring to another company that gave me 5 star attention and service. It's good to see their are businesses that still have the highest quality of integrity. Thank you Rob

We book a reservation for four deep tissue massages at this location. When we arrived at the location they did not have a reservation and said that one of the employees did not write down the reservation. They did offer give us a gift card for one free massage which was a nice start but there were four of us that we're left out in the cold. Each one of us should of received a complimentary gift are or at the least a discount for each of us for another massage at another time. My two star review is not a review of the massage since we couldn't get one. This review is only focused on the lack of compensation for the time taken out of our day and being that is was an anniversary that time is valuable
