I'm sorry but how do u screw up a simple pizza delivery? I even called back to CONFIRM the delivery address and my name , delivery address and phone number in case there was a single issue? How do u screw this up!!!! I called a third time to ask where our pizza was ...since we are opening a new optometry office and our kids are here hungry...while we unpack and organize.  When I called a third time asking where our orde was...I shockingly was told it was attempted and no one answered!!! Omg!!!! We have been here all night!!!!! I went with Spinnatos because their food is good...but I'm pretty sure papa Johns would have at least been here as promised...with food for our family and not made excuses for idiot staff manning the phones and screwing up orders...never ordering from here again.  Called a fourth time to ask where our food was...now an how and a half late....I'm now told its on way...yet girl who answered on my forth call to confirm delivery address gave me the wrong address yet again!!! This is rediculous and impressive...

Having worn glasses most of my life, I have seen many optometrists over the years.  My usual routine for selecting an optometry practice  always seemed to be based exclusively on the styles of frames they carried, with the actual exam and personality of the doctor  sadly being my last concern.  The big chains always overwealmed me...and I never ever left feeling like I connected with the staff or doctor.  I never realized how much I was missing out on, in finding the perfect combination of style options and an amazing doctor, until I took my son to see Dr. Fuller at Optical Illusions.  My son was 5 and I decided to have his eyes checked, considering I was wearing glasses by 3rd grade.  We chose Optical Illusions because a friend highly recommended them.  We made an appointment with Dr. Fuller and after that visit, I realized what I had been missing out on all these years.    Dr. Fuller was fantastic with my son.  He engaged him throughout the entire exam and knew all the tricks to ensure that the exam was thorough and complete, as he was relying on the perspective of a child.  Not to mention that his awesome sense of humor and ability to incorporate it into what most expect to be a monotonous eye exam, makes the entire experience fun!   He diagnosed a condition that I had never considered could be present,  and referred my son for further testing with a pediatric optometrist.  My son absolutely loved him, and so do I.  His staff took the time to help us find the perfect pair of glasses for my son, and he had a blast trying on the frames.   I suppose I should make an appointment to see him myself...one can never have too many glasses at home to accessorize with!    They have two offices in the valley...and both carry the latest in trendy and high end frames, all at very affordable prices.  I highly recommend this practice for your family's eyecare needs!!!

Very limited menu...can't even split egg whites w one regular egg for omelette . Every other breakfast place does it! No kids menu...not even anything remotely kid friendly.  Prices are ridiculous and fruit is extra! Not coming back!

I went to Grazie tonight with my 8 year old son, and our new baby.  Being a Wednesday, I figured it would be a cute and quiet place for us to have a quick bite to eat.  We got there around 6:30PM, and there were two other small parties seated in the entire place.  Our server eventually came to help us, and I ordered what i thought were basic entrees for an Italian place.  My son ordered a ceasar salad with chicken, and I ordered what I thought would be the vegeterian pizza (the one with all the vegetables listed on the menu).  What I was served was apparently their actual pizza called the vegetariana.  It consisted of charcoal burnt "carmelized onions, oily sundried tomatoes, and a little cheese, all burnt into a blackened and overcooked crust.  My son's salad was drowned in dressing which was very fishy tasting for a traditional caesar salad.  I also ordered a bottle of wine, had a glass, and corked it to bring home for my husband to enjoy with his sadly burnt pizza.  Upon serving myself one slice of the burnt pizza, I started examining it, as all i could see were piles of burnt "carmelized onions".  It clearly was NOT the vegetable pizza I was expecting.  Our server was nowhere to be found, so I went inside to ask for clarification as to what pizza I was served.  Inside, I found the server, next to a little dog perched on the bar, in the same room as the kitchen!!!! This is a whole other issue I will address another time.  I told the server that the pizza I received was not the one I wanted.  She informed me that it was the "vegetariania" and it was really good, and I should try it.  I was confused, as I had just told her that I didn't want it, and somehow the menu was confusing, as I wanted the vegetable pizza.  Burnt onions on burnt crust does not constitute vegetable pizza to me, for the outrageous price of 16.00!!!!!!   She VERY hesitantly offered to prepare another pizza for me, but again repeated how I really should just try the one I was served, because it is really really good.  At this point, I was in shock that I was being told I had to eat what I didn't want, and what was burnt as it was, instead of being served the actual pizza that I wanted.  I also told her that my husband didn't care for garlic or onions, and the pizza was actually for him once he got home from work this evening.  She then went on and on trying to tell me that the carmelized onions weren't really strong nor was the "burnt garlic flavor" I explained to her, that I tasted when I took one bite of the pizza.    After realizing that she really had no sincere intention of trying to make the order right, with her awkward and wishy washy offers to maybe make another if I really didn't like the ONE I NEVER WANTED TO BEGIN WITH, my son and I ate our gross meal and tried to enjoy our evening.    The most disturbing part of my experience at Grazie came after we were about finished eating.  Our server came over to check on us, and my son accidentally spilled his drink all ove the table.  I quickly grabbed a napkin and pushed the liquid into the center of the table.  Our waitress quickly "sprung into action" and exclaimed, oh, let me get you a towel for that...and then...the best part....SHE NEVER CAME BACK!!!!!   So there we are sitting at our table, with the only two paper napkins anywhere to be seen, soaked with soda, waiting.   Then, I look across the patio, to one of the other two tables in the entier place that have customers, and I see our lovely waitresss, TAKING THEIR FOOD ORDER!!!!!    She finally returns, apologising for not coming back sooner, and I just smile at her.  Then, she again suggests I order another pizza for my husband, and we can just make it the way he wants, no onions/garlic, etc.  At NO POINT during my interaction with her, after making it clear I didn't want the pizza she brought from the very beginning, did I ever imply I wanted to PAY FULL PRICE FOR A SECOND PIZZA!!!!!!    So, having said that, she returns with a second pizza, which at any other reputable establishment, would have been complimentary, given the series of events that had transpired that evening.    My bill came, and I was charged 16.00 for the disgusting burnt onion and crust pizza, AND for the actual pizza that I had wanted from the beginning, I was charged another 18.00!!!!!!!  Grazie is a poor excuse for a restaurant, and it's customer service is embarassing.  My bill came to over 85.00, for one adult, and an 8 year old.  Next time, my 8 year old and I will be going to the House Brasserie next door to Grazie, as they actually are deserving of the 85.00 tab that I would expect to receive there, because the food and service are 5 stars always.  If I had the energy tonight, I would have refused to pay  tab delivered to my table.  I was already traumatized by her inability to understand customer service, so I paid and left.  I will NEVER EVER return to this establishment, and am considering calling my bank to dispute the charges.

Terrible and overpriced!! Had to ask three people for a spoon, ketchup, and nobody came back.  Ordered a chopped salad...halfway through it, sans dressing because it was awful, I realized the chicken that seemed extra soft, had blood thT squished out of it when poked w fork. Told waiter, And his First response was ...let me go ask the chef about this!!! Elbe returned with my bloody chicken salad an place it down in front of me, informing me that he'd seen chicken do that at other restaurants in town, and the chef said it was fine to eat! Ummm WTF kind of morons do they hire???? He even charged us for the thing!!! I complained to manager and handed complaint cArd to him...and said we were not retiring! What a disappointment!

Horrible service for gross overpriced food.  Last weekend...we came to see an evening movie.  First...:we sat for over half an hour in the lounge watching lazy staff stand around and chat...not one person even made eye contact to take our bar order.  The server first brought wrong order...we are vegeterian ...we don't want chicken..then we found a long disgusting hair IN our popcorn! Oh, and for the record management....if you read this...we were charged for the awful experience, hair and all!!! We ordered a second beer and the server took the existing glass we were still drinking from after taking our second order!!! Today...came for an early kids movie....again horrible slow service and Yep...again...I had to ask twice for our popcorn...and next...we ordered a second beer...it never came!!!!  This theater used to be classy and nice...now it's a trashy ghetto waste of time and money!!!! When will the owners or investors step in before its run into the ground! This is the Biltmore people! We don't come here for trashy lazy service!!!  Let's see what manager takes the time to address this issue on here...

Since the menu change....yes a few vegetarian options...but the kids menu options are crap and half the size and quality they used to be.  My sons chicken strips were cold and stale...wow what a disappointment.  The prices are insane for shitty food as well.  We will not be eating here ever again!  The Biltmore mall restaurants are a short stroll away....and well worth the price over this place.  If the theater is losing money, jacking up the prices on horrible food isn't gonna buy them much time.

Having so many options for Christmas Eve dinner, we chose to go to the House, one of our favorite "Go To" date night spots.  My husband is a vegetarian, so there were many delicious side options for him.  I ordered the filet, which I have had in the past, and enjoyed very much.  Tonight, the filet preparation was just "off" to say the least.  It was tough and simply not a good cut of meat.  Our server was amazing, and she kindly returned it to the kitchen.  They sent out another filet, this time, well over cooked.  The manager, Vincent, came by to check on my meal, and I honestly let him know that my meal was "OK".  I felt awful that I couldn't honestly say it was up to the usual House standard, and Vincent insisted that they bring me another entree to make it right.  He suggested I try the swordfish, and it truly was amazing.  Vincent made our entire evening enjoyable and we were so happy with the service once again.  I understand that every restaurant can have an off night, and tonight, the entire staff at the House made our dining experience right...and we will definitely be back again.  Brunch is one of our favorites at the House!!!

Knew there would be a wait...but the the one thing I  really wanted to go for was the yummy pancakes.  I specifically asked our waitress if there was a pancake and eggs item.  She said no, had to order separate.  We placed our order and I ordered my 3.50 pancake.  We had great service for the first half of our experience. Our food came out and my pancake was raw inside! The batter was liquidy!! I showed the waitress the issue and she promptly took it back to "show the cooks".  30 minutes later...she returns ...my coffee still empty...acting surprised that someone else hadn't brought my pancake back out .  Then 15 min after that...she returns again saying they were just making sure it was fully cooked.  Still no coffee refill offered.  At that point, we had finished our meals! It was clear she had forgotten to follow up on my order to begin with and thought lying to me ...twice ... Would pacify me.  I told her to forget the pancake...and we also had to get up and ask another server for our own to go box.  Truly she was clueless about the entire situation ....very disappointed and i won't be returning.

Then I asked if there were any vegeterian appetizers to use it on at dinner, as we were going to go see a movie after dinner . She said alll they had was the ahi appetizer....um hello idiot ! I asked afaib for vegeterian appetizers and she said the ahi was all they had...ok not ever going back there! Wow stupid

Had vegeterian pho...was good...but when I called to place order, I asked if all the sauces would be in bag w ingredients and was told yes. There was no sir racha !  I also ordered a veggie spring roll, asked if it was like the ones at rice paper, their sister restaurant, and again told yes. No...it was basically lettuce sprouts and asparagus and no vermicelli noodles at all! Hands down rice paper downtown is the best!!! Very cute interior though at slanted rice...I will try it our for dinner.
