I'm from the Bay Area where the first Lee's Sandwiches first opened, so I must say, it's an accomplishment that they'd open one down here. When the bread is hot and fresh it's really good, but once they're cooled, they're so freaking stale and  hard. I'm sitting at the tables eating the baguette sandwiches trying to chew on the bread as if I was a hobo that hasn't ate in forever. The only items that are actually good are the smoothies because it's actually something fresh. I recommend raspberry+carrot. I used to work there, so I made a lot of concoctions. I suggest the italian sodas too. Oh, and avoid the fat old man that cashiers sometimes. He's so rude and doesn't handle customers well. He makes everyones first experiences at Lee's a complete and total disaster.   If you're someone who wants to order wings/eggrolls. Call ahead of time before you come in, they say it takes "5-10 minutes" it actually takes like 20.. And, there's no wifi, even though the website says they do. They don't.

Found this place from a coworker and my boyfriend flew into town for our anniversary, so I decided to book a reservation here for 2. This restaurant is amazing! The ambience was great and the food was delicious. My boyfriend and I tried the Chef's tasting menu which was a 4 course dinner for each of us. We were amazed and surprised with what the chef came up for each course. Every meal was spectacular. If you're in and hungry, the 4 course is not the way to go! Porportions are quite small and delicate if you're someone who has a large appetite. This restaurant is a little pricey so we bought a certificate before hand. Although, our minimum did not reach up to what was required to use the certificate, our waiter, Jay tried his best to help us. All the servers were extra friendly and helpful. For dessert, my boyfriend and I were supposed to get a plate each, but the chef was so caring enough, they made us a dessert tasting platter with many different types of dessert! I thought that was such a sweet gesture. The restaurant all in all has great ambience and hospitality! Most likely will come again for a special occasion.   P.S: Antipasti are great and afforadable!   &A complimentary gondola ride is given when buys an entree at Alto's! Great experience and is fun. The gondola man and the gondola greeter was super friendly and nice! :)

Good food, bad service.   Their food is good and authentic Vietnamese food can get in Arizona, but their service sucks, like really sucks. Got our food, and we needed something and our waiter was no where to be found so I got up to the cashier counter and found my waiter standing there texting, like really? You've got to be kidding me. The waiter didn't ask how things were going, I had to get up and ask for my bill, refilled our waters... ANYTHING. This isn't just once, I've gone here three times and still the same, horrible service. I would totally understand if they were busy, but every single time I visited, the entire restaurant was literally empty besides my table and another's.  All the employees there are either behind the counter watching tv, on their cell phones or talking to each other. If it weren't for the good food, I definitely wouldn't be coming back.

I love coming here for lunch. Being honest, most thai restaurants are just overpriced and aren't good.. but Thai Spices, omg authentic AND prices are great! Super friendly/down to earth waitresses and great service. I especially love the 10% discount they have on yelp! But even without the discount, I'd go here anyways :D Great atmosphere and great food, like.. what can get better than this?

My fave local Italian restaurant for lunch and dinner!  I come here every other week, totally in love with Rigatony's. Their antipasti salad (it's served with bread sticks when buying an entree)  is soooo good, better than Olive Garden's for sure. I love how everyone there is super friendly and helpful. The owners are wonderful to talk to when I had a complaint about a waitress one time. My sister and I love coming here for lunch and dinner because they have a pasta special called the "Pasta-bilities" affordable @ $6.99 and you get to choose your pasta/sauce/toppings. Their seafood pastas are very delicious and not overpriced. I always love taking my out-of-town relatives and friends here for lunch! Overall, great local Italian family restaurant!  P.S Try their tiramisu, it's to die for!!!!!!

Great customer service by Mai/My. She was very personable and listened to exactly what I wanted. She made sure I was satisfied with my gel manicure ($30). Definitely will be coming back!

Wannabe "Pho Ao Sen"  So my parents told me that Pho Ao Sen is under new ownership and the name of the restaurant changed. They told me that the new owners still kept the previous restaurant's chef so regulars from Pho Ao Sen can still get their delicious food. Turns out, they're wrong. Same chef, food modified!!! Modified in a bad way. Everything changed but the restaurant's decor. The staff is unfriendly and it's hard to identify who is the staff because they were all unmatching casual clothes.... Anyways, the food sucks. Used to go to Pho Ao Sen often, gave Pho Number One a chance, and it was my first and last. Bland pho was served to me at room temperature.. Pho is suppose to be served hot so the sliced rare ribeye beef can get cooked... Bad service and bad food results in never coming back. BYE!

What else can I say? The tacos are great! And the staff is super friendly. We always come and ask for Brittany; she is honestly the most personable waitress. She is always attentive and always makes sure we have everything we need. We love coming to get tacos here, mainly because of her! Tacos are great, especially with the deals on Monday! Margs are equally as great as their tacos and burrito bowls :)

I love this lash shop! I fully complete trust getting my lashes done safely and correctly. I come to Alesha and she is wonderful. I love that she is such a perfectionist because she always take her time and makes sure that they are done nice and even. There's nothing more comforting to know that you they don't rush, even within a time frame. I recommend this place!

The service is just as great as the ramen! I had the extra spicy ramen and it was delicious. Although, I wished it was more spicy. It has a kick to it, but not as spicy as ramen I've had before.
