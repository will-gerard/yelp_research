These guys are amazing. I went in to get a quick release and they took amazing care of me. I've gone into several bike shops before where I was treated rudely because I didn't know as much or am not a serious rider as they are. I can honestly say I was shocked at how well this went.    Seriously check it out.

I live right up the street from this place and go as often as I can. The food is always good and I have yet to really be disappointed with it. Delivery can be a little pricey ($4 charge) but definitely worth it if you don't feel like throwing pants on for dinner. Service has been nice, I haven't had the chance to check their lunch buffet or champagne brunch out , yet, but as soon as I do I will update this review to reflect the experience.  I recommend ordering the "Special Chicken" really good!  My only issue with this place was the small amount of rice given when I ordered delivery, it was two full orders and we only received one box of rice to share, which is the same amount you get when you order one order.

I found Brian after looking for a good mechanic on Google.  I can say he exceeded my expectations. He was always helpful and willing to go the extra step to help me out or anyone I referred. Speaking of, I referred Brian to anyone I knew. He's truly the best mechanic I have had in Phoenix and even in general.

Good food for a really good price. My coworkers and I went here for lunch this past Friday and really enjoyed it.   The service was really nice and offered a lot of suggestions, our server was Enriquee, I recommend him.   The food was pretty good, I got the shrimp burrito and was surprised at how good it actually was. Their lunch specials looked like a good deal, since you get a main course with sides. For q group of five of us it was only $37 so pricewise, it was a good deal.

Dutch bros is great. I stop by there any time I can (my problem is that I live over 10 miles from the closest one) and every time I get amazing service. The people there are always in a great mood, wanting to talk and willing to give me suggestions when I don't know what to order. There is nothing bad I can really say about them other than I wish there was one closer to my home.

I've lived in several different apartment complexes but this one has to be the worst I've ever had to deal with.   At first it seemed like everything was fine, the place seemed decent enough and it was conveniently located. But as soon as everything was signed and done, they changed their behavior. The front office people became condescending, closed off and rude. Trying to get them to help out with any issue took more than one phone call EACH TIME.   The apartments were cheap, as others have said, you can hear EVERYTHING. Things break and the issues aren't addressed, because as i said before, trying to get their help is impossible.  Simply put, just stay away. They just want your money and that's all they care about. They'll treat you great before you sign and then they'll just screw you over. If I could give zero stars I would.

Pretty good food for lunch time. I definitely recommend ordering on-line to avoid waiting in line.

I originally came here because of two reasons:  -It was in my network -they were open on Saturdays  I'm glad it worked out. The team here is great. They not only do awesome work but they work with you on payment. I've had to break up some payments for dental work and they were happy and able to let me do so. Not only that but the dentist worked really hard on the dental work.   I recommend this place to anyone reading this and have actually recommended it to friends. I have a friend that goes here now and really likes it. The dentist was able to figure out dental work he previously had just through a quick examination.   In summation, this place is great and the team is even better.

I loved it here. Simply put it's amazing.   I was lucky enough to not have to wait long for service, although I've heard that there can be a long wait time.   The food was good and the prices weren't that bad. I ordered the grand Prix and really enjoyed it, it was a small amount of food but it was really filling. My friends ordered the smokey and the Papa K. Both were delicious.   I used the coupon for free coffee on yelp and it was good, plus free refills.   It was nice be a use after we were done eating one of the servers brought us milk and cookies to enjoy "while we talk." I didn't expect that and was very happy with it.   Overall I'd say that you should definitely go here, even if it means making a drive.

These guys were parked outside of my work today and as I walked by they offered me a free sample. Well the free sample was actually more like a meal. They gave me two dumplings, two pieces of chicken skewer and a bowl of beef stew.  It was all delicious! I am a big fan of Chinese food and this was surprisingly good for a  food truck. I'm definitely going to try them next time they're in my area. If you have the chance, give the dumplings a shot for sure.
