I have been going here for over ten years, but our latest visit was our last. 11:45am, five adults, one kid, and a six month old. Even though it was busy, we were sat and placed our order right away. 30 mins goes by and we try to find our waitress. Another 15 minutes later we finally tracked down our waitress to see where our food was. She said "we're working on it." Meanwhile, my kids are being so incredibly good but one was very hungry (we all were) and the other was trying to nap since it was taking so long. 5 minutes later the manager comes by and says they "lost" our order and would we still like them to put it in? Really? We said no thanks and left. I've worked in the restaurant business. That's not how you treat customers. They didn't seem sorry, more relieved because they needed the table. There was no apology, no offer to rush the order, no offer to comp anything. So disappointing.
