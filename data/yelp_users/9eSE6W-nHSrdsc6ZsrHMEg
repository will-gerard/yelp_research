Hidden gem! So helpful on many occasions I've had shoes repaired and watch batteries replaced. This time I had my watch sized and they are always so helpful and fast.

It's too bad they aren't any nicer to customers. It's always empty and their prices need to be more competitive.

Called and placed an order to pick up and was told 10 mins. Sat outside in my car and ten minutes later went in to find out they never placed my order. I was told another 8 mins to get it started. Waited another 10 minutes until they had my order ready.  I expressed my disappointment with the situation and of course the clerk had zero remorse as she could care less what I thought. She told me that the manager must have taken the order and he's in the back that's why they didn't know!!!!!! That's a terrible excuse, they could have offered me a free dip or a discount for wasting my valuable time, but instead they just showed zero interest in keeping my business.   This is not the first time this type of error has happened here, I won't be returning again. They have a bunch of kids working here with no sense of what customer service means.

I purchased some shoes at fashion square and didn't realize they gave me the wrong size. I came in and Carter was able to find the right pair in the right size and was super professional about it. I was in and out within ten minutes.

Was starting to lose hope for Sprouts but the staff are much friendlier at the Tatum & Shea location. Todd was fast, friendly and efficient, might be management.

Passed by so many times and never tried it til just recently when the Mexican Craving kicked in!   Very tasty huge portions, can definitely share an entree with two people. I thought the refried beans were a little too salty. The service was slightly slow but that may be due to the fact that this place was busy. Our waitress, Claudia was very nice and funny. The busser refilled our chips without asking, that was nice.   Overall it's a great little place and we will be back!

Went in on my lunch break looking for a quick meal. They had a lot to choose from anything from sushi, salad, soup, pizza and much more. I noticed they are quite pricey just for a lunch to go. The clerk that helped me was Ronin, he was very pleasant and helpful. I would give him 5 stars as far as customer service is concerned. I do enjoy the variety of unsweetened teas they have.

It's a shame that I have to write this review with only two stars because I really love the food here. How is it possible to mess up an order every single time? 97% of the time they screw up my order. I work near by and order at least 2-5 times a month.  The two stars are for the food alone! Their service is terrible, not sure of her name but the woman who seems to be the manager that's usually at the register is very rude! I have heard this from two other people who have experienced the same worst service from her. You cannot be rude in the hospitality business.  I love the bread they have and most items on the menu are great. It's pricey, but tasty.   If you choose to continue the terrible service, lower your prices so it makes sense.

Was in the plaza and needed a coffee and figured I'd try something other than Starbucks. Looked super clean and organized. Chloe was the barista that helped me and she was very nice.   They use powders instead of syrups, I didn't like that you could see it in the drink. I ordered a vanilla iced latte, tasty!   I will be back

Shame on you Hilda! Absolutely zero sense of customer service! Hilda completely ignored me as I stood at the counter waiting to return a pair of shoes. You lost a $98 sale and I will never purchase shoes at your location again. Hilda needs immediate training as I'm sure she does this on a daily basis.

I love the food! My favorite is the chicken kebab, it's juicy and delicious.  You gotta try this place, it's casual to fine dining, you see it all.  I suggest starting with the hummus then and entr√©e of your choice (can't go wrong with anything) and ending it with he ice cream!  The bread alone is fantastic, I love it with the basil they bring with it. The house hot tea is delicious as well.  Today our service sucked but I'm assuming she was new. Any other time the service is good.

Hadn't been to Macayos in years. It's really nice inside and outside. Our waitress, Cathy, was super nice and friendly. Chips and salsa were great but I wish they had more choices for iced tea. The food hits the spot for that Mexican craving and there are lots of options.

I had the four seasons salad and it was good but our waiter was terrible. So slow, it took 30 mins to actually place our order and at some point our waiter left for the night and someone else took over. Maybe you should notify your guests that you're leaving. Not impressed and won't look forward to coming back!

Disappointing & poor service! The two stars are for the burger only! Four of us came in for lunch and our waitress clearly did not want to be there. Was rude and unpleasant. The hostess also looked miserable and Mande our experience very uncomfortable. Being in the service industry one would think you would try to go above and beyond and that was not the case this time. Training is definitely needed here. As great as your burgers are, we have many choices.

Love this place! The menu has everything you could possibly crave. My boyfriend and I visit about 8-12 times a month. I love everything I order. The service varies here, we usually have Josh help us, he's very good and always takes care of us. The food is always great and fresh.

I love it here as they have so many options. This time we had a new girl, Carly, who was extremely friendly with a great sense of humor. Our order was perfect, waitress was fantastic and the food of course is always delicious.   I have definitely had some poor service here before (hostess and some other waiters) but this time Carly was great. Great job guys I will be back soon.

It's very clean and smelled lovely! I always go to Starbucks due to the convenience, but this was a treat. The gentleman behind the counter was super friendly. I ordered a iced coffee with vanilla and it was ok. The coffee tasted a little burnt.

The service is terrible here! I come because it's so close and I need a coffee fast but don't expect customer service to be a priority! It's also always messy and dirty, out of napkins and straws. $5 for a cup of coffee, it should be made that way I like it and a smile?! Not everyone is rude here but majority rules.   They also have a whole wall of holiday sale items with no sign of how much they are or even a percentage for customers to figure it out.

First visit here and it was tasty. I had the salmon dinner which was good but a bit well done for my taste. I like my salmon a little more moist. Service was good. I can't wait to come back and try other items.

This is a late post but very much needed. My boyfriend and I decided to check them out since they are walking distance away. If you get the Thai  craving, don't expect anything special from Takeda Thai. Our bill was $45.57 for TWO People. That's a little high for tiny portions and subpar flavor. They charge $3.99 for Thai tea! Without telling you if there are refills and their famous coconut ice cream? Is a joke. We got two baby scoops that were the equivalent of a tablespoon for $7.95. After we were done, our waiter took close to 40 mins to close is out because he was busy talking at the bar. This place needs a lot of work and better management. They also need to lower the prices. The $45.57 would be worth it if it was amazing food and service, but they fell very short. Save your money and keep looking for another Thai venue

The food is sooooo good here! The wings are amazing, everything is so delicious. The best Indian cuisine in the valley! Lunch specials are great too. I would give them 5 stars but the bathroom is so unbearable that it needs attention.

Decided to check this place out since I was in the area. Super busy but was seated right away at the bar. I ordered the El Guac burger, it was delicious.  Made exactly how I ordered it. It came with fresh cut fries too. Very tasty, I ordered it medium and the flavor was really good. Jon was our waiter, very nice and let me taste some beers before I decided on Four Peaks Kolsch. I would have given them five stars if it were not for the disgusting bathroom.

I've given two stars but really should be zero stars. Due to the amazing ambiance, the two stars go to the amazing setting outside with the holiday lights and fire pit table. Very nice touch!   My terrible review goes to our service! Our dinner lasted 3 hours, not by choice! Everything took a long time. Our waiter showed no sense of urgency and it was obvious that we were on HIS time. He exuded a sense of superiority with constant correction of our choice in drinks and food.   I was under the impression that waiters rely on tips and tips are based on service. Our waiter just didn't care to impress and unfortunately this reflects negatively on the resort itself. Ten people walked out of there with with no intent to come back anytime soon.

Mind blowing experience !!!  My friend and I decided to visit Dominicks for some beignets. I had never had them there before and she assured me they were good and we had to try them. I love beignets and was very excited about them.   We walked in and I asked the hostess if they have beignets and she informed us they did and we decided to head over to the bar for much anticipated beignets! As we were about to sit, we informed the bartender we were there for some coffee and beignets. He told us they don't have them!!! We thought he was joking but he was not. We went back and forth about 5 times and finally went back to the hostess. She assured us they DO have them and that the bartender will be notified. We went back to the bar and told him we were told they do have them. At this point the bartender told us they do not place orders for them unless it's a "Special occasion or special person" Whaaaaaat????? I could not believe what I was hearing. They are only for special people? How is that determined at dominicks!?  We told him AGAIN we were told they are available, he walked away who knows where to check. With my blood boiling, I decided to go back to the hostess and tell her we will not be staying as this type of treatment is unacceptable.  The beignets were already ordered so we stayed, they were ok nothing I would ever come back for. The whole experience was ruined. I wanted to order a latte and he told me they only have was press or cappuccino. Really? I think there is a lot of training needed at this pretentious restaurant, if you have espresso then you pretty much have any other coffee drink.

This is my third visit to Barrio Queen and I'm sorry to have to review with only one star but it's much needed.  I'm a huge lover of guacamole and when I see tabletop guacamole, I'm all over it! It's $10 for the guacamole and thy don't even fill it up. $10 gets you one avocado! That's way too high.  I ordered the California Enchilada, it was ok but nothing I'd tell my friends about. It actually came warm, like it had been sitting for a while. I also asked for a side of sour cream and when I got it, it's wasn't sour cream. It was creme fraiche. They also charged me an additional .50 cents for it. (I didn't use it at all as it was not what I wanted) Maybe the waiter should explain what their version of sour cream is and in that case I would have declined it.  The worst part of the whole experience was the horrible chips! BARRIO QUEEN YOUR CHIPS ARE TERRIBLE! Not only are they very hard and thick but they're dangerous too! I took a bite and it slices the inside of my mouth and now I have an open cut in my mouth that needs to heal.  The whole experience was terrible. Fix those chips, I can't be the only one that feels this way. It's as if they are old and have hardened.

$10.75 for table side guacamole that is only two tablespoons full. Our bowl looked like it had already been eaten and was bland with no flavor. Missing the lime and the spice! They also pick the smallest avocados to use. Our waiter was terrible and could care less, you would think he wasn't working on tips!!!!  Attention barrio queen, increase the portion size of the guacamole or get smaller bowls so it doesn't look so terrible!

Great food, service and atmosphere. If you're looking for perfect portions of delicious food, give Rusconis a try! Every time I visit, I leave full but not painfully stuffed. I love the fact that this place is a locally owned restaurant with great service!   On my last visit, Colin was our waiter and he was great! Very attentive but not overly annoying, which is always nice. I've been here many times and everything is tasty. From appetizers, salads, dinner and desserts, they are all delicious.

Terrible selection of products, rotten fruit and long long check out lines. You would think it's a Wal Mart! I counted 26 people waiting in line with only three cashiers! Really? Unacceptable !   Their produce is always wilted and on the verge of death and the employees look miserable!

Love this place!  I always try to have my coffee here since it's so tasty and pretty at the same time. More locations are much needed.  They have an amazing patio that overlooks the lake. Very cozy and the service is great. The decor is like a little cozy house with a piano. I had a hazelnut latte and it was delicious. The coffee tastes like perfection. My cousin got an almond milk latte and I had to taste it. Hers was also delicious. They also offer food, I have had the salmon salad before, very good if you're in the mood.   Keep up the great work, I will be back.

Love this place! Nice patio outside and cool interior. Feels like home. The service sometimes takes a while but the food is very good. Must try the bread pudding afterwards. My favorite pasty is the Greek. The tomato soup is amazing and the salads are great. If you like beer, they have some amazing variety and always change it up.

Came in for some shakes after a meal somewhere else. Not my first time so I know how great burgers are here.  I got the latte shake and strawberry. Very tasty, we sat at the bar and had friendly service while enjoying those amazing shakes. When the time comes for a burger, I will be back.

I've been here a dozen times and love the food! It's super close and their hours are convenient. They are always very busy! Expect a 20-40 min wait when you come here! As far as service, I've had everything from the waiter crying and throwing the credit card holder to amazing attentive service. They are definitely not organized but the food makes up for it! I've loved everything I've tried so far, crepes are my favorite!   On several occasions we have had Erin as our waiter and he is very good. If you're lucky enough to get him, you're in good hands! Very attentive in a sincere type of way.   I would love for this place to have a better dress code for the women, they tend to wear club-wear and it's just not appropriate for a breakfast place. Also one of the managers or owners mom wears her nightgown there and it's a bit odd!  I recommend maybe a shirt with your name or logo and some jeans! Simple

The space is extremely small. We walked in and were told they take reservations, but they were able to seat us.   They have authentic Punjabi cuisine. They are pricey but tasty. Their bread (naan) is really big and good! The service was slow but they were very busy, our waitress was nice. I did order hot tea and the mug had dirt on the rim which grossed me out a little.   Overall I like this place, but have to admit it's a little pricy.

Came to OHSO for the first time and it was excellent! Our waiter was Eric and he was great and knowledgeable with the menu.  I'm a mac n cheese connoisseur and I have to say, both macs are great here. I love the spice the crab Mac had.   It's a cool place for all types of people. Great place for happy hour and get togethers. I will most likely be back. Thanks

I like this place and recommend it if you're in the mood for fish! Poke is great, fish tacos are two huge tacos that you can actually share. Travis was super friendly and helpful and really looked like he was enjoying helping us. That's refreshing these days. I love the tiger sauce, whatever you do, try that tiger sauce...so good!   They have plenty of seating inside and a nice patio outside. I will return again soon I'm sure.

Very delicious home style Punjabi food! My very first visit here and I left stuffed! The restaurant is very clean and open. We tried the Buffett and everything was so delicious.   The service was great as well, they made sure to come around and fill your water and fill up the bread.   They actually comped a Mango Lassi drink and it was soooo good that we actually purchased a second one. If you like mangos, you have to try this drink.   Overall, my visit was excellent, I'm looking forward to going back soon.

My first visit for lunch and it was delicious! It's a really nice space and the menu looks really good.  Crab cakes are yummy and they have mango iced tea, unsweetened!   I had the Spinach, Kale & Quinoa salad and had them add chicken to it. Very tasty.   Service was very slow, they are new so I'm sure they will work it out. I will be back to try more items.

Decided to try his place as its new and close to work. I got my meal to go, it was a bit slow considering there were not a lot of people there.  When I got my order, I decided to order a Thai tea to go. It's a bit pricey for what you get. A small to go cup was $2.50  I also didn't get utensils or napkins in my bag to go, there were a couple young kids working there. Needs some training on the menu but I will be back. The food was good and I'm looking forward to trying more items on the menu.
