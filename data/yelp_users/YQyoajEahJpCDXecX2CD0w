I'm sitting in a Garbanzos restaurant and it makes me want to give a Pita Jungle a great review. :-)  Nothing comes close to the Shawarma Pita. Nothing. Not the Gyro House and certainly not Garbanzos.  We have never been disappointed with Pita Jungle. And every time we try someplace new, we are disappointed. Enough said.

Yuck.  Slow service. Over priced. Ordered eggs over medium, got a runny mess.   $10.45 for sausage and eggs.   No thank you.

Garbage sound. I don't care who comes here, I wouldn't come and see them.   Really. Don't bother.   Scale the Summit and Intronaut are amazing but you wouldn't know it by the sound.   Garbage.

Great pizza! Nice atmosphere. I like the Lucia - cheese, tomato sauce, sausage, and mushrooms. My wife likes the Biaggia - prosciutto, figs, four cheeses, and arugula. Not a ton of options on the menu but that's because what there is is enough :-)  Check it out if you're in the neighborhood.

Wow! Just tried this place for the first time!  We've lived down the street from OBH for 6 years!!! Breakfast sandwich was AWESOME!  LOADED and delicious. Must go back and try omlettes and scrambles.

Wow! Soooooo good! Fresh, fast, and incredibly flavorful. And a great value and happy, knowledgeable staff as well.   All around fantastic. We had the Chicken Kati Roll and the Thali Chicken Platter at lunch.   Go go go! :-)

We really should have read the reviews BEFORE we went here!  Friday afternoon (2ish) and the place was empty, so why the hostess takes us on a meandering tour of the dining room, with all sorts of tables by the window, and tries to seat us right beside the kitchen door is beyond me :-/ But then again, this same hostess seated two tables right beside us (where we were now at one of the window seats) and each time hollered across the empty dining room to tell, in one case "Collette", our waitress, and in the other to "Justin", who looked to be maybe a sous chef. It was actually kind of funny. She'd tell their name and then point at the people at the table.   Anyway, the Bang Bang shrimp app was decent. My wife says the Caesar salad was good. Her chicken wrap had flavor but was tiny, as though they had made a big one and then cut it in quarters instead of half. I hope whoever got the other half of the wrap enjoyed it. I had the lunch combo with the chowder and blackened fish taco. The chowder had good flavor. The fish tacos were laughable. They looked like the street taco apps they serve at Z Tejas, except not nearly as filled with goodness. This was supposed to be an entr√©e size. I hope the picture does it justice. It was a long way down to find the filling and, when I scraped back the bits of corn and some wilted green (maybe spinach, maybe cilantro), I found the thinnest slice of fish you could imagine. And this couldn't have been an accident because both tacos were identically sad.   Adequate food but a terrible value and service that was almost silly; it was as if we weren't there at times. The waitress hooted to the sous chef looking guy "three dollar, makes me holler" when she came to clean the table next to us and collected her tip (where it seemed the couple left before their meal came, but I cAnt be sure). I the heard our waitress say to the table behind us (remember, we're in an otherwise empty restaurant but we're seated next to each other) "I'm sorry, I'm usually much better than this".  I'm not sure I buy that.
