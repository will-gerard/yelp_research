I really like Chipotle but the staff at this location could have been more attentive. I was rapidly pushed through the line even though it wasnt that busy. The salads I bought had very little lettuce and the steak was dry.   Overall im not happy with this location or the service I got. Next time slow down a bit, pay attention to the customer and be aware of portion sizes.

My god. Do not get the salad. Im actually quite shocked at the sheer meagerness of this salad. 8+ dollars for a dressed up side salad is rediculous. I honestly thought it was a cruel joke until one of the reps reassures me that this tablespoon of salad with pepperonis on too was in fact the whole thing.   Sandwich was great. The salads are a complete joke. Im actually kind of insulted by it. Had to go home and make another dinner to eat with this morsel as a side item.

Honestly im incredibly disappointed with this location and Nextcare in general. I have been dealing with a perscription correction for over 2 weeks. Not only is it impossible to just call in and speak to someone, the call center that takes the calls doesnt make it very easy to handle issues.   First off. In the location they are real quick to say they got your issue completed but they havent actually done anything. Then when you call in you have to go through countless verifications AGAIN....and then explain everything that happened again! I have had to call in 5 times to fix a simple perscription error they made. 5 verifications, 5 explanations, and still I am doing it again waiting on hold.   Im so completely pissed over the amount of time its taken to work this out. Its unreal. If you value customer service and your time. Please pick a different urgent care company. This company cant handle simple tasks or follow-through.

Great place. Andy is a must see here. Hes runs the place amazingly! Games are fun and food was awesome. Waitress and cook doused my wings in buffalo sauce which was awesome. I always ask everywhere else and nobody ever puts strong amount of wing sauce on the wings. Much appreciated!!!  Great football atmosphere. TVs everywhere!

Literally the worst Chickfila experience I have had so far out of all the times I have been. First, the blonde girl taking my order was rude and made an off comment asking me if I had ever been to "A Chickfila" cause I couldnt find the sandwich I was looking for.  Then when I asked for 8 buffalo sauces for the entirety of my group order the blonde specifically ignored me and put only 6 on the order. I had to wait off to the side and get more.  Then after we got our meal delivered to the table we found out the sandwich was wrong. My girlfriend was so hungry she started eating it while I went to get the correct sandwich. I waited in line again for 10 minutes to get my order fixed and the manager was also extremely rude! She asked me to prove i was wrong and walk back up with the sandwich.   Finally she grabbed the sandwich and gave me another semi hot sandwich with unmelted cheese.   In conclusion, I barely scratched the surface of how bad of an experience we had. I just dont want to write anymore. If a company is going to have that expensive of fast food, they should at least be courteous. Im never going to this Chickfila again.

Seriously. The bartenders here couldnt have been any worse. Im actually shocked at the lack of attentiveness and just general malaise of the lady working behind the bar..... We came here for a Sunday funday birthday party and she literally killed the buzz with her attitude. Wasnt a great experience.

Great place to chill in the heat. They have top of the line misters that keep the patio cool during the blazing hot summer days.   The only compliant.....The portion sizes on the salads and many other entree items are like little bite sized appetizers. I mean I get the whole Scottsdale chic vibe with the ginormous plates. However,!when a guy is hungry and orders an entree he shouldnt have to double order in order to get a decent amount of food.   If you go there just get the burger. Everything else is like a small bite sized appetizer.  Enough of my ranting. I was just extremely hungry and the 16 dollar salad that I finished in 4 bites was hangrily disapointing.   Everything else about the place is awesome!! 5 Stars if you fix the food situation.
