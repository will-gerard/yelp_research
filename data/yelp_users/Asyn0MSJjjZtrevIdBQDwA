I'd like to know the "other" Mexican food places that are so much better. Los Sombreros is awesome! The drinks are poured with a heavy hand, which almost justifies paying $9 a cocktail, but that's to be expected at a lot of places. The salsa, first off, is to die for! The hotter of the two has a very strong chipotle flavor, which I love, but for those who don't the other one was just as good. The weird little pinwheel wheat things they give you with the chips are not my cup of tea, but just about everything else is. I think the spot is totally quaint and charming, and the servers are always accommodating. I'm vegan and started disecting the menu when the waitress asked if I was vegan, and I am, she suggested I get the chef's special vegan dish- rarely does that happen! It was amazing, the sauce was incredible, the potatoes mushrooms and corn were cooked to perfection and I appreciated the extra veggies and avocado. My boyfriend loved his, which was a fish dish, and everytime I go everyone loves it! Try it out.

This place is awesome! It's so cute and leaps and bounds better than what it once was.. I love their soy dirty chai! So good. When they first opened they told me they'd have more vegan options soon.. boo, still lookin' to see when that will happen.  Love the drive-thru on a busy day.

I love this studio! I immediately enjoyed the attitude of the place and felt extremely welcomed from when I first walked in. My very first class I was spoiled by being positioned right next to one of the instructors who happened to be taking the class that day and Sumit was teaching.   This was my first time trying hot yoga and I have to say it- I'm in love! Everyone working there seems to be extremely hands-on and helpful. I love that you're told sometimes what a certain pose helps with in your body. I was impressed by the entire atmosphere: dimly lit, perfect music and just the right amount of encouraging words.   Although I was extremely happy with my experience, being a newbie to the hot style of yoga I decided to try a bikram studio which (to me) just wasn't up to par with this studio.   I honestly cannot recommend Sumits enough.

Seriously? It's been a couple years since I've reviewed Cartel and I just want to give 'em kudos again. Thank you universe for this little beaut and the fast, amazing baristas that run the place. When 1pm lunch rolls around nothing sounds better than running to Cartel from work for a pick me up and they never, ever fail me.

This place is awesome. Arizona is lucky to have such a great vegan dining option. We could use a local in TX. The end!

This place sucks. I have no idea why they seemed to be fairly busy when we were there on a Sunday afternoon.. the only feasible option being every person in there was either hungover or still drunk from the night before and needed something bland and greasy to coat their stomachs.  First of all, they don't offer a veggie burger. ..Seriously? Yet their menu online states they do. SO basically if you're vegetarian you can get something somewhat resembling a grilled cheese; or they'll offer to put a runny fried egg on top- appetite whetted? Note to the veg*ns: Not worth your time.  The boyfriend got the biggest burger possible and was thoroughly disappointed in everything on it. Somehow it was piled high with seemingly interesting ingredients yet he swore up and down it was less than lackluster, no taste at all. He also got their haagan dazs chocolate shake and it had only the slightest hint of a chocolate taste and was runny. Runny. Haagan Dazs, Shake. Doesn't make sense, right?  The bread is super gross and gets soggy. The only semi-redeeming item(s) are the fried pickles and flash-fried asparagus. But honestly, how can you muck that up?  Waste of money! Bring your business somewhere local.
