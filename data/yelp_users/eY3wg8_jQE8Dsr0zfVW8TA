Every trip to Vegas leads us to Satay!!  Love this place!!  The decor is fresh and clean.   My husband loves the Pad Thai. (It's a bit sweet for me- I just double up on the lime).  I had the Tum Yum with chicken- level 8. Lots of chicken and mushrooms-  so flavorful and the spice level was spot on. Got me a bit flushed.  Spicy Basil with coconut rice was good as well. Requested to add onions which was no problem- a bit crunchy on the veggies. Better than mushy veggies though.   My dislike- crab rangoon appetizer.  Tastes like hot cream cheese, no crab flavor.   See you in a month Satay!!

We came here on a Sat mid morning. Place was jammin and had about a 20 minute wait.   Once we sat down, the drink server was right there to take our order. Food server was right behind her to take our order.   Our food was delivered in a timely manner and was delicious- eggs Benedict and a nova and onion omelette ( no cheese). The home fries that came with the meal were wonderful. And they have fresh squeezed OJ!!!!  Oh and the bagels were amazing as well!!!  Will definitely be back!

Food was great....not your typical American portion (which I have to say is nice). Especially when u travel and cannot take home leftovers.  I hate to see food go to waste.  Nothing spectacular but certainly nothing to complain about.  Our server was very attentive and food came out correctly even with special orders.

Love this place!!  We originally went in for some crawfish- (my husband was feeling adventurous)- come to find out their is a season for crawfish. Guess we will have to come back for the crawfish boil.  : P  We loved our food!!!  I had the gumbo-- wow. Flavorful, full of goodness with a hint of spice. My husband had the Bronzed Shrimp-  amazing. Spicy, thyme-y (is that a word?),  wonderful.   I ordered the Gouda grits but they never came.  Our server remembered halfway through the meal however at that point I was full and didn't want them. She was kind enough to bring me a sample. Cheesy goodness!!!    Definitely will keep Lola's on our list of places to go when in Vegas.

Not sure why the marks in this place are so high. The food does not have much flavor.  We had a carnitas torta and carnitas taco. The beans were tasty- liked that they were not pur√©ed so much that you could tell they were beans.   The place is cute and staff is friendly.

Strange, strange place. Shares kitchen with Papaya Thai. Had a Groupon and decided to try it out.  We ordered spring rolls and crab wontons... Not bad. Then moved on the chicken pho, which I enjoyed. My husband ordered chicken and shrimp noddles with 5 spice level. Was surprised to get shrimp pho. The plate that came out next was awful... No shrimp and it tasted like grease.  Very disorganized for only 4 tables. No bueno. Don't waste your time or money.

Went here on their 1/2 price pizza Thursday's. Got here at 5:30 and they were busy!!  1/2 off appetizers for happy hour--   Had the caprese salad... It was good .. Lots of basil!  Also ordered their wood fired wings- 6 Italian and 6 buffalo. Like the crisp of the wings however the flavor was not there.   :(  Now the pizza-- is gourmet without being too fancy. The crust is thin and crunchy.. Mmmmmm. Sauce is light but tasty.   Did not order the meatballs this time but they are the way to go!!    Doin it right Tony Sacco!!
