Very disappointed with the pedicure I received. It was extremely rushed and lacked the sentiment of pampering yourself and relaxing. It was not meticulously done and there was nail polish left on my skin. I  can definitely do a better job myself.   In addition to that, the nail technician cut my big toenail at an angle to the inside on each side of the nail, and it looks absolutely ridiculous. It was only that one nail so my overall pedicure is inconsistent. I brought it to her attention even though there was nothing she could do to change it and she brushed it off and said that's how it's done.

This is the best Blimpie there is in the Valley! The owner is so friendly, helpful and he has my order memorized! The customer service here is great. And of course their sandwiches are so good, with fresh sliced meat and fresh toppings! The buffalo chicken is the best, I get it every time. Plus they have Pepsi products so I can feed my Mt. Dew addiction!  I would highly recommend this sandwich shop and specifically this location!

I love BJ's Brewhouse! They have it all; great service, a wide variety of beer selection, excellent food in appetizers and entrees, and a beautiful restauran. I have rarely ever waited to be seated and their service is fast. I like to order the Harvest Hefeweizen, it had great flavor and is spicy enough for my taste. We always order their chicken wings - I like the hot and spicy sauce. My favorite entree that I always get without fail are the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos, they're delicious, light and refreshing. I have loved everything I've eaten here and will definitely return.

This place is fantastic, it's a hidden gem! We keep going back for breakfast but need to try it for lunch as well. You wait in line to order and receive a buzzer for when you're food is ready, then pick it up at the window. So it's efficient and you're not dealing with a waitress. I've only ordered their Breakfast Tacos with sausage, they're delicious with great flavor. They come with a side of beans that's unexpectedly great for breakfast. The seating is very casual and kid friendly, you can sit inside or outside. The place is always full because their food is so good - I would definitely recommend!

The varieties are endless, spanning across the globe. I am a beer drinker as well as a wine drinker, they have a huge selection of both! You can make your own six packs to try different beers from domestic and imported; from the US to Germany to Belgium. The wines varieties are also from the US to Italy to Japan. Also, they have a 5 cent wine sale on select wines where you buy one and get a second bottle of the same wine for 5 cents. In addition to the sale giving you a great deal, you're able to try different wines. If you find yourself unhappy with the first bottle, you can return the second one with your receipt to trade for another wine. If you have their card, you receive even greater deals and are alerted about the deals going on; I love BevMo!

The Dog Paddle - Wheat beer has great flavor and is my favorite, great summer beer. And if you like wings, get them grilled and re-tossed.

Always a quick, friendly drive through! And they make my iced mocha perfectly every time. Love this location. The only downfall is pulling into the parking lot, a lot of congestion right around the entrance.

Very disappointed that I had to pay extra for a holiday drink and my cup wasn't filled all the way... There is over an inch of room. When you pay extra for peppermint mocha bc it's a "holiday" drink, knowing you can order peppermint mocha year round and then you get shorted, it's upsetting.

My favorite dish is the Stuff Chicken Marsala, it is delicious if you like mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and marsala wine sauce.  The salad is always a good choice because it's fresh!  Also, the peach bellini tea is amazing; it's great tea with the extra sweetness of peach.

I love Sweet Daddy Cupcakes! They're my go-to cupcake shop. They always have a great variety! They put the most popular on the top which makes it easy if you're indecisive. My favorite is the Triple Chocolate, it's a chocolate overload; if there is such a thing! Their cupcakes are moist and delicious. I would definitely recommend this shop!

I was referred to Flict by a friend who spoke highly of this salon. It is decorated so well and is so pretty; from the paint color to the hanging doors which act as their stations. It's calming with the brick walls and muted teal and purple paint. It's unique with the different styles of chairs and cute tables for the clients to set their water or magazines on. It has a beautiful view of a lake and has a lot of natural light. I was referred specifically to Brandi, she was excellent! I have long blonde hair that was in need of some refreshing. She listened and offered insight and sounded confident to make it happen.  She was pleasant conversation and so sweet. My hair turned out excellent, it was exactly what I wanted! I will definitely be revisiting her and Flict in the future; and I definitely recommend them!

The Hub is an excellent sports bar! They provide SoundDog that gives you a personal sound box on your table for a specific channel playing. So you're able to listen to the game you want.  Their Arizona Smoked wings are the absolute best wings I've ever had - they have great flavor and fall off the bone.  They have a good variety of beers available.  There can be a wait sometimes because it's so busy, but it's worth the wait.  Love this place!

The bruschetta is amazing. My favorite is the artichoke one.  The East location also does an excellent job making gluten free food. The bruschetta can be made on tomatoes or green apples.

I love this place, you don't feel like you're in an airport! I've only had breakfast here and I would recommend the Zinc croissant, add avocado. It's delicious. Also, always recommend their Bloody Mary's - they have great flavor and they will give you the pepper and tabasco to make it spicer. I would recommend this restaurant if you're at the C gates in Sky Harbor.
