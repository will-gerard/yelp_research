The out-of-town family wanted Mexican, so we took them here. Since I don't eat meat, I'm not a fan of most Mexican restaurants because there is a limited selection for me. Here, the waitress recommended the shrimp and veggie tacos--both were great. And, I could even eat the refried beans (because there was no lard in it)! We all got Cadillac Margaritas and everybody was very pleased with their food. I also appreciated that they were so diligent about the reservation, a party of 8. They gave us a table upstairs that was private and spacious. For someone who doesn't typically consider getting Mexican food, it says a lot that I'm looking forward to going back here in the near future.

Literally walked out after 3 bites. The sushi was disgusting and didn't want to chance anything else. A waste of $53. If you want to avoid food poisoning and/or parasites, stay away.

We had such a great experience! Jon was our pilot and Chad was the crew. They were welcoming and provided enough information to ease everyone's nerves. I was so impressed to hear about the passion they both had for the art of ballooning and the immense experience Jon had with piloting. I've already been recommending this company to anyone who expresses interest in going on a hot air balloon. It was a treat!
