Mark's Cafe is a small, inside/outside diner with friendly servers and amazing food. As my first time here, I was impressed with how quickly we got sat and got our coffee. I asked whether the bearded man on the menu actually looked like Mark and the waitress laughed and said yes. Mark is actually her father! Plus her daughter and husband were also working - a real family business!  I got the special of two eggs, two bacon strips, and French toast instead of pancakes. Plus, the waitress offered to put some cheese on my eggs, and listed a bunch of options including feta; I of course chose feta. Before I had even drank half of my coffee, our food was there.   Everything was hot, delicious, and made to order. I'm very happy about my experience and will definitely come back!

The ladies here at Simplicity are simply amazing! Always smiling faces to greet you, friendly technicians, and super quick treatments. I can get in and out in less than 10 minutes. Best thing, after one session I saw a significant change in my underarm hair texture and growth. I recommend them to everyone!

O Charlie's. I keep going to you out of convenience but I keep being consistently disappointed. The female workers are lovely people with whom I enjoy chatting. But the service is completely terrible. Only one person working at 3 p.m.? I have counted 15 people in line at one time. I think most businesses would recognize this as a problem and act to fix it! Not Charlie's....  Additionally, burnt coffee, burnt espresso, burnt milk! If the coffee and food were on par with the high prices, it might be okay. However it's the whole combination of bad food, bad service, and TERRIBLE COFFEE that makes me frustrated with this coffee place.
