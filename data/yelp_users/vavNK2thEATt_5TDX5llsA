I have been coming here for YEARS and am sad to say that until I ate another amazing lunch there today, it never occurred to me to write a review.  Every meal I have here is better than the last, it's ALWAYS consistent, and the menu has something for everyone.  My personal faves are the black bean soup and the Bethany Home Chopped salad (and I'm not really a salad kind of gal :)!!!).  But don't shy away from the ribs, OMG is all I can say, or the PCG pasta.  Come to think of it, any PCG virgin I've taken here has raved about it and become a novice themselves :)! Add in the full bar and great wine list, this place is a MUST for a constantly consistent great meal! In regards to the attire i chose dressy because if you came on a weekend night in jeans and flip flops you may feel under dressed, but you could absolutely go jeans and flops during the day for lunch (as I did today)! Happy eating!

Okay yes this is my second auto shop review and yes I'm a girlie girl, but a good body shop and great mechanic are priceless tokens!! And when I had a BMW the guys at Auto Europa were my best friends :) (to put it in perspective, I was in a first name basis with the owner!!).  If you've owned a beamer you know how insane the maintenance and repairs can be (you've been warned if not!), and having a trustworthy, affordable shop is like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  So here you are grasshoppers, my secret to Euro-car repair bliss :)

Been to Cibo several times and have had no problems with the food, but what I don't go out to dinner for is a flat out RUDE server. My room mates and I went to Cibo on a thursday night and got right in as we chose to sit inside, i.e.. the place was not swamped as it is on a weekend night. We waited so long to even be helped in the first place that had to finally ask someone if we HAD a server as we would liked to have ordered a bottle of wine. When we ordered apps, as we couldn't pronounce what we wanted, we pointed it out on the menu to the server, so she clearly saw it. However when an antipasti platter came out and we said that wasn't our order, the food runner took it back to our server, who brought it back out to us and continued to argue with us that we did in fact order the antipasti, which we hadn't. Our pizza took so long we actually had time to finish the bottle of wine and could have fallen over if we'd gotten any eye contact or mention of our pizza and where it may have gone. I don't care how amazing the food or how popular the restaurant, servers with poor attitudes are never worth the time and money.

Could we be any more fortunate to have a mountain preserve in the middle of our city?!?!  I hike this mountain and the hundreds of trails that make up this area, at least 5 times a week!!  The parking can be terrible but for those of us who hike on the weekdays there is usually no problem, especially when it gets warm and the wimps stop hiking :).  The circumference trail is my favorite, it covers almost half of the Summit trail and dips off down the back for about another hour or so of great up's and downs.  Make sure your Camelpack is full for this one though, it kicks buns!  The full Summit trail is THE buns kicker, but once you make it, you can be the queen of the world, or king, whichever suits your fancy :)!! And did I mention the competitive monthly rates for this kind of workout??? Oh that's right, it's free :)!! See you there....

YUM YUM YUM.  Okay getting right to it!  Brown Velvet Cupcake, check.  Signature Urban cookie, check.  Monthly specialty Vanilla Bean sugar cookie, check.  Instant desert gratification, CHECK.  They don't have the variety of a grocery bakery, but this place has quality over quantity down to a science.  Everything we had was amazing, I almost need to forget it exists :)!  And to those cookies left there that narrowly escaped my clutches, I'll be back for you :)!!  Trust me, this place is worth an extra hike or spin class this week!

This place is a diamond in the ruff... seriously.   It's not much to look at from the outside, and it's easy to miss from the street, but take a chance and park the car, you wont be sorry.  The food here is awesome! The gyro meal is a good deal and my "go to" here, a GIANT gyro, fries or side salad, and a drink.  The gyro meat is amazing and every time I order one it's better than the last.  The seasoned fries are great so if your splurging don't miss those (note: they taste unbelievable dipped in hummus!! Trust me!).  You can drive through or come in but no need to dress up if you dine in, this place is casual to the max (which I love for stuffing my face with a gyro, you could go there in sweats :)!!!).  Not your average greek spot, this place is a gem!

ROJO DE LA CASA!! I repeat: ROJO DE LA CASA!  Go there for brunch, and don't remove your buns from the seat until you've ordered, eaten, and without a doubt, fallen in LOVE with this dish.  I enjoy this place for many reasons: centrally located, great specials (drinks, apps, and weekly and daily entree specials), and I've never had bad service here, which in and of itself is a miracle these days and enough to make me like this place.  But the rojo :), which is a flour tortilla open faced, topped with a delicious blend of red chili sauce, CHUNKS of falling apart meat, potatoes, cheese and eggs to finish it off.  I mean, seriously?!  If I could eat this every morning I would.  The selection is great and creative, and they have an amazing wine, beer and liquor selection.  The only downfall is the parking situation, which is possible but inconvenient, and totally worth it :).

Okay I am ashamed to admit I eat here at least twice a week, but it's almost justifiable with the lard free beans and fresh ingredients!!!  Though I must say the service can sometimes be questionable, it's WORTH it (and Im a HUGE stickler about service so...)!!  My must have, bean and cheese burrito ADD their famous carne asada with guacamole! And warning: the chips and salsa may be habit forming :)

This started as our "go to" spot for dinner before events downtown, but it has graduated to borderline addiction status!  Aside from the amazing sake list, cool atmosphere, and good service, the food is not only fun but delish!! Two things we ALWAYS order (and I'll confess we order two of each of these... don't judge me :)!!!), sugar cane pork and soup gyoza.  Both contain pork, (obviously with the sugar cane) and are completely different but out of this world! The gyoza (dumplings) actually have soupy broth inside them!!!  The claypot Red Curry Tofu is spicy and delicious, and the Lemongrass chicken is the perfect cooling compliment! Make sure to ask for a side of rice (or two as they are on the small side) to go with the tofu! If your in the mood for something completely different, take the time to track Sens down and come hungry!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE :)

Sutra may be the PERFECT yoga studio.  The owner and her husband couldn't be more inviting, and the instructors are not only friendly and warm,  they kick butt!! Sebastian's classes make my legs quiver and Danielle has me sweating my buns off, and loving it!! The prices are some of the best I've found for my crazy expensive yoga addiction! You MUST check out Sutra ASAP!!!

Just popped in here for a manicure because my usual go to couldn't get me in, the place is nice inside and the gentleman who answered the phone and made my appointment was really nice, overall the staff is very friendly. I will say that while my nails look good, the manicure was $34 dollars and  there was not much fluff. Where I usually go you get all the bells and whistles and a gel manicure is still only $25. The price is what made me leave a star out, but I must stress my service came out fine.

After two very successful trips to Teakwoods it has become the official "no need to dress up" local bar!  The space is giant, with lots of tables, 6 seater high tops, and bar space.  They have an extensive menu that includes options that are NOT fried, which is a welcome alternative to traditional bar food.  I recommend trying one of the lavosh pizzas, the bruscetta variety was delicious without feeling too heavy! Though don't be alarmed they have all kinds of yummy indulgent stuff as well to soak up the liquor, er ,I mean diet coke :)!  But as far as liquor and beer go, there's plenty flowing, and they have my favorite, Blue Moon!  Definitely check this out!!

I've had so many massages at so many places, it's been hard to find a massage therapist that really stands out in my mind, that is until I had my first massage with John. Professional, knowledgeable, and a true master at his craft, John manages to fix what ails me without making me cringe in pain. I am a hairstylist, and my neck, shoulders and hands suffer, in fact, I was close to seeing an orthopedic surgeon for my hands, but since my most recent massage with John, I have literally NO aching. He is absolutely a MUST, you will walk out feeling like a new person!!!!! Do it. Hurry. Off you go. Get yourself to Space and let John get you back in line!

If you know me you know that I have bad car luck (knock on wood just in case).  Case in point, my car is currently being repaired at Lovetts courtesy of an absent minded lady in a parking lot (LOVE those ladies by the way :)....) with a giant SUV.  However, I can cruise in my rental in peace knowing that my car is safe in the hands of the people at Lovetts.  Now, I must first tell you this shop is owned by women (insert jersey shore fist pump)!!!  Not only have they fixed my car to perfection on several occasions, but they are UN-believably fast, and professional.  This is without a doubt a place I would recommend to anyone who needs body work! Side note: they also have a full mechanic and do just about everything EXCEPT oil changes

Service has never been a strong suit of Stingray in Scottsdale, however I had high, but unfulfilled , hopes for the Biltmore Stingray.  By far the WORST service I may have ever had.  It was a dead 3pm on a friday and we sat at the bar, and might I add, were the only customers inside! We asked for water with our beers 3 times, and had four entrees that we didn't order brought to us and nothing that we did order. To top it all off, the bartender was absent, RUDE as ever, and couldn't have cared less, ALL while the manager watched on!!! He was too busy helping entertain the numerous other servers and bartenders dancing around in the bar area doing nothing.  NEVER GOING BACK, note: drive up the street for Zen Sushi instead!!!

Okay :)... several months after I posted my review on Stingray Biltmore I recieved an email from one of their partners!  He offered me a $50.00 gift card and said he felt the problems I had experienced there had been rectified.  I, being a believer in 2nd chances, took a few friends to Stingray in hopes of a better experience.  I must say that the service wasn't AS bad (and it was REALLY bad the first time) but it was not great, and our bartender/server (as we sat at a booth in the bar) was definitely absent minded.  HOWEVER, the fact that one of their partners cared enough to take the time to read and respond to my email says a lot!!  If for nothing else, I can respect that and had to up the stars a bit.  I do think one of the partners or owners should find a way to eat there unnoticed, so they would recieve the same service as everyone else is actually getting there.

Two words: Butterfinger Shake.  Two more words: Life Changing.  Loved the large selection, and the location is great and centrally located!  Service was good, it was lunchtime when my friend and I were there and the place was packed, but it was definitely not reflected in our service!  Of  course I had to try the house burger (purely for research, haha), so I ordered the Zin Burger and it was great.  I don't know if I would go so far as to say it tops the Deluxe Burger from Deluxe, but definitely comparable.  Oh and did I mention the butterfinger shake :)?

I understand that the clothes at H&M are cheap, but I don't care what kind of a 'bargain' Im getting, I cannot wrap my head around flat out RUDE employees. I was honestly floored by how abrasive, short, and far from helpful the people at this store were. It was honestly as if they were doing me a favor by being there! No thanks :), I'll walk over to forever 21 and spend a little less on something I'll wear for one season, and at least deal with employees that can crack a smile.

I can't say enough GREAT SPECTACULAR WONDERFUL KICK ASS things about 27 Tattoo Studio and specifically, Apryl! I have gotten tattoos for 12 years, and my experience with Apryl supersedes any other tattoo by far. Not only is the work LEGIT, I mean, my tattoo Kicks Tattoo Ass, but the studio is beautiful, clean, and well thought out, they are professional and it's obvious that giving QUALITY tattoos in their first priority. If you are getting a tattoo in Phoenix, breezing through the area, or want a tattoo you will be in LOVE with for life, get your soon to be inked ass to 27 Tattoo and get in Apryl's chair STAT.

LOVE LOVE LOVE! Good food, Great Service, even better specialty cocktails. I've read several other reviews of Windsor and am SO sick of hearing people complain that "it's not Postino"...um hello, it's not supposed to be. Fun Fact, restaurateur's do occasionally open restaurants with different concepts, this isn't a cheesecake factory people!! The #29 cocktail is totally unexpected and I may have a small addiction going on, and I drool over the Fattoush Salad (ps, I add chicken and Skrimps :), yes Skrimps), and the vibe there is just so fun and laid back. All the servers couldn't be nicer, and my server last time, Lisa, was the best...on top of things, friendly, and FAST.  My new fav hang out, and no, no intervention necessary please!

Turns out kitchen organizing in flip flops is a bad idea, long story short, I ended up with a black toenail and an ingrown from cutting it down too far. Another bad idea, bathroom surgery on your foot. Noted. Based on the referral of a friend and fellow yelper, I reluctantly took my problem child toe to Arcadia Foot and Ankle this morning. Dr Cheney is great, a hybrid of being understanding to my childlike fear of medical needles and procedures, yet straightforward about what I needed to remedy the issue at hand. I left feeling relieved and am back on the road to all 10 toes being a beautiful skin colored shade, sans ingrown toenails.

Jenna Renshaw and her team are the best thing to ever happen to my sweet boxer Brody. She knows her stuff, she is up front, and the best part, she comes to YOU (for an insanely reasonable price by the way). I never really felt like I had full confidence in any vet I ever took him to, and in larger clinics I always felt like they just wanted to up sell me. Jenna is straight forward and as good as they come. I will never take Brody anywhere else, and I literally refer EVERYONE to her, and they are all only bummed they didn't know about her sooner once they see her. Don't waste any more time at any other vet in the valley, call Assisi Veterinary Service NOW.

First time here, really impressed! Adorable inside, clean and open kitchen concept. Food was yum! We split the gyro fries, chicken jalapeño pita and a Greek salad, all were delicious. This may have just became our new neighborhood spot!

My first set of lashes, and I couldn't be more pleased! I searched long and hard to find a place I thought to be reputable before making and appointment with Lash and Sugar. My appointment for a level 2 classic full set was with Jessica, she was a consummate professional, talked me through the entire process, and was sweet as could be. My lashes look amazing, full and luscious without looking cheesy or overdone. My mom, who has had lashes for four years and is extremely particular, called and got on her schedule the moment she saw mine. Overall I was pleased with the building, accessibility, the business itself is well decorated and comfortable, and my lashes and Jessica were top notch! 5 Stars!!

Authentic Mexico City style cooking( i.e. Not smothered in yellow cheese, with ridiculous portions and massive amounts of sour cream). Family owned, traditional, and healthy alternative to the usual Mexican food in Phoenix. The chef herself actually came out to greet us. So happy this little gem is in our neighborhood!
