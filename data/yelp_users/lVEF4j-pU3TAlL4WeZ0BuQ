Great mexican food and great salsa! They have an excellent breakfast burrito and lots of lunch specials. I love going here but the food is so intense i usually want a nap afterwards.

So sad! Ive been coming here for 15 years and used to love this place. My 5 star review is now 1. Prices have gone up $2 and portions sizes are going down. The food is still good but its not worth the money. I dont know if management changed or if they just started trying to gouge people but i hope something changes. They lost a long time loyal customer today.

I managed to convince myself to drive the 15 minutes to this Mcdonalds, as it was one of few open at 1 am.  I ordered a coke, drove home (30 min round trip plus wait in line) and discovered to my dismay that I had been given a Dr. Pepper. I hate Dr. Pepper, threw it away.  This is not the first time I have been disappointed in this store.  On several occasions on late night visits they have not been able to accept debit.  Another time I received diet coke.  The next time I feel like a late night snack Im going to Wendys.

This place is expensive, small and filled with little kids. The lead climbing is a joke and the bouldering is mediocre. Its ironic that the most convenient gym in phoenix is the worst. The staff is incredibly high maintenance and obnoxious. Not worth it for climbers, maybe for a kids birthday party

This is literally the best meal i have ever had (no exaggeration). I got a lobster tail with a filet on the side (amazing, the lobster had a tequila sauce). They make guacamole right next to the table. The place manages to do authentic Mexican food in a classy way; most places can only do one or the other well. The margaritas are delicious. Also we brought a family of 8 and they sat us (the place is small so it took a while) but everyone agreed, hands down the best food we've ever eaten. Every time i go back i love it. Way better food than taco guild or other pretenders out there! Im almost sorry to give them such a good review because they may get too busy!

After cartel in Tempe this is one of my favorite coffee shops in Phoenix! The staff is great! And the owner is often there so quality is always at the top.  The only real problem with the place is it's so popular it's often very crowded, if you want to meet someone there make sure to show up early so that you will have a spot. Outlets are plentiful and it's a great place to get work done. The food is delicious (and if you don't like it pane bianco is next door) and the pastries are dangerously good. The coffee is excellent and roasted in house. They're also surprisingly affordable, except for the meals and alcohol which aren't cheap but Aren't too expensive either.

The gyros are delicious and there is a huge rush at lunch.  Don't be fooled by the slightly sketchy exterior.  I go with the chicken Caesar pita and I'm never disappointed.  They have side salad options but the fries are pretty tasty as well. The price is reasonable for what you get, worth trying!

I dont get why people love this place. I came because of the word-of-mouth; I thought it was fine but just fine. Definitely not worth driving from downtown Phoenix. If you're going to go don't believe the hype and you will probably enjoy it.

Ive been coming here since they were just local roasters who wanted to make some drinks on the side. The coffee is excellent, they will occasionally throw out your drink and make it again if the expresso looks off. The staff is helpful, thoroughly competent but a bit snobby, as hipsters tend to be. Who cares, this is the best coffee in phoenix!

This used to be my favorite gym but they changed ownership and the place seems run down. Still the features and routes are interesting and the "super cave" - climb through boulering area is great! Lots of lead climbing and good bouldering. Staff is less obnoxious than PRG.

Great breakfast. A friend of mine is a pancake connoisseur and says they have the best pancake he has ever had. I will say I've had better chilaquiles, but their other Mexican food is great! Excellent lunches. They let you mix and match tacos so you can try a lot of different things. All the beverages Ive tried, from tea, to coffee (which they get from a local roaster), to cocktails like margaritas are very tasty. The only real negative is how popular the place is. Parking is limited so it can be a challenge to actually get in.

This place needs to make up its mind! Sometimes they're coffee shop sometimes they're a restaurant and sometimes they are a wine bar. I think they've tried music venue/art gallery as well. They do none of these things with excellence. The coffee is fine, often bitter or weak. The staff can't be blamed, since they are not trained as baristas. Dont order dinner, i've tried several things and nothing is great but it's all more than $10. Honestly I come still from time to time because the place is so conveniently located and every time I go I regret it (I never seem to learn, I go three times a year and its been like 5 years). If you want to be a coffee shop be a really good coffee shop, if you want to be a bar be a really good bar, if you want to be a restaurant be a really good restaurant! Pick one, and focus and do it well!!

The milk they use in their coffee is excellent! The coffee itself is better than most places and they have a pastry happy hour which keeps thongs cheap. Their breakfast burritos are ok but the prosciutto and egg dish is delicious. The really great part about this place is the ambiance. The wall opens up in the Spring and Fall seasons and there is a nice desert garden which helps you enjoy the weather.

This place is inconsistent. First: the coffee is good, the roaster is good at what he does. This review is only true of the biltmore locations. The problem is the baristas. Depending on your barista you will spend more or less for the same cup of coffee. For a large iced latte ive spent as little as 3.17 and as much and 6.50. Sometimes i ask for extra shots to keep the ratio right, sometimes the baristas include them for free. Some baristas dont tamp the espresso, some do. Some pour hot espresso into a plastic cup, and then add milk, some know that plastic melts and pour milk in before boiling coffee. I want to give the place 4-5 stars because of the baristas who are great but i think the shop has a management and training problem. I keep coming back though, i just avoid the people i know are bad.  Also seating is a huge issue and parking is annoying. Come here to but coffee, but not to sot and chat with someone.

Parking is a nightmare!!!!! If you can ride a bike or walk, do! That said, the cocktails are very tasty and they have a menu full of interesting bourbons. The place is great for going and sitting with an old friend or a lady for drinks. The patio seating is very cool, lots of fires and festival lights. The food for the price is only okay, i wish it was either better or cheaper by a few bucks (both would be great, but this is the real world). I've had a few decent burgers and sandwiches but they are on the small side and will not "wow" you. The beer selection could be bigger but the beers I've had all very tasty.  Huge bonus: next door to the place is churn! Delicious, possibly life changing ice cream. You should definitely go there afterward.

Look I've seen this place compared to Venezia's and I have to disagree, Jimmy and Joes wins!  The amount of food you get for the price is spectacular.  They have their own hot sauce which is greatly superior to other Hot Sauce's.  The staff is friendly, and the food comes out quickly.  The pizza itself is delicious, great sauce and dough, and the toppings are wonderful.  Im glad they finally made a location closer to Tempe!  We used to drive quite a ways to the Chandler location.

This is the same place as urban beans. If you'd like you should just read my review for that place. All I can say about this is the food is mediocre, and the place isn't classy enough to be a wine bar. Go somewhere else for food and for coffee

I really think this place should be more like 4 1/2 stars. Your horchata is delicious as  is the watermelon lemonade. I really enjoyed the burger and the beef taco but a few of the other tacos were only ok. The place was very small! Be warned don't take a massive group!

The food we had was very tasty and reasonably priced. We had in house specially cocktails that were delicious!  I did try the molè and I've had much better but everyone has different opinions on molè,  my wife liked it. We enjoy the food at the Clarendon downtown and I was glad to hear that this is owned by the same people! Definitely worth trying

The food was delicious. I tried everyone else's meal (shameless) and i liked everything. The service was great! One of our appetizers came out bland and we mentioned it to our waitress who was much more offended than we were! She took it back and brought us another and made sure we didnt pay for either. The only knock against that its "coffee shop" are, though a nice place to sit and chat, makes mediocre coffee for the same price as really good coffee :/. Save your money and get more food!

Best photographer i've ever seen! Not only are the images excellent but he is great with people (a must in awkward family gatherings like weddings). He is fun, kind and fades into the background so well that you are always surprised he was there to capture the perfect moment. I wouldnt hire anyone else, and i know people who regret hiring affordable over quality. Wedding pictures last forever :).

The coffee is inconsistent- not necessarily  bad mind you, just inconsistent. Depending on your barista it can vary from good  (man with salt and pepper goatee) to terrible, strong to weak, acidic and burned tasting to decent. The seating is bizarre, and outlets are sparse. Its not a good place for a meeting, might be ok for a date.   Dont buy alcohol here because their liquor license wont let you take it to the games, buy from the culinary drop out instead (confusing since they all seem connected).   One more note: this place is CRAZY HOT in the summer. Really inadequate ac for phoenix. I mentioned it to a sweating waitress (who agreed) but nothing changed. I mentioned the heat to a guy who seemed to be a manager who just opened one of their cool garage doors- if anything changed it was hotter.   I havent tried much of the food, mostly coffee shop pastries. The bagels are a great deal, scones were dry and muffins were nothing to write home about.
