My buddy has been trying to get me to come here for years lol. I've been given him the cold shoulder if you know what I mean. Funny enough I came here on Christmas day and had a blast. Needless to say Doc and Eddies will be our new favorite hangout. The staff is great the food is awesome and everyone that comes here is here to have a good time.

I go here every year for bike fest. It's my favorite bar by far for the event. Although the drink prices are through the roof it comes with great atmosphere like girls dancing on the bar and picking on the patrons witch I love. But I went to Vegas just to get out of town with my girlfriend and decided to stop by for a drink because she had never been there. Much to my surprise there drink prices were still through  the roof when there were no events going on I paid  $32 for 2 redbull and vodkas. I will still continue to go there for bike fest but that's probably the only time it's worth paying those prices.

My girlfriend took me here for the first time today. So I'm one of those people who likes his meat well done lol trust me people I know I here it everyday that you loose all the flavor when it's well done but that's how I like it. Nevertheless I ordered my burger well done and when I received it it was medium at best I'm not one to complain so I didn't say anything and I ate it. Wasn't bad but I would still rather it been well done still a great place

We go to Oreganos very often but we all ways wondered about this place. Not a big fan of the valet parking in such a small parking lot. The food was less than average and the service wasn't much better. I'm pretty sure that my girlfriend and I won't be returning anytime soon with all the other great places to go.
