Big clean international airport, I'm comparing this to LAX.  Really nice staff that will help you with your bag.  There are a lot of stores but I haven't been able to explore becuase I'm usually running to my gate.

I decided to come here for dinner after reading numourous good reviews.  I was disappointed.. though the pho broth was very clear, the noodles and meat were not so good.  The noodles were more like rice noodles and the meat was as rough as sandpaper.  The eggrolls were decent, very fresh.  I'm still debating to go back and try the porkchop.   All in all I would rather drive down to Chandler for a good bowl of Pho

Legit Hong Kong chinese food, we've lived down the street and never thought to venture here.  One day we decided to come because my grandpa was visiting and we wanted to take him to a Chinese place.  As good as it gets for HK Chinese food.    To try: beef chow fun with egg sauce (bland for most but I prefer less salty things) roast duck lo mein ( a little on the salt side but good!) Roast Duck & Roast pork is YUM.

Just like every other target its very neat and easy to find things you need.  The downside is you always spend more than you intend to.

Who doesn't love ice cream?  Nothing special about Baskin-Robbins except the workers are very nice at this location.  Always a good place to stop by after getting gas

I have no idea why one day I was craving the steak here.  I went to another branch once back when I lived in California.  It was packed for a Monday night.. mostly snow birds.  We got tilapia, sirlon steak special, and a rib eye steak. Took the waitress a wihle to take our order, she brought us over bread that was super fresh and hot, very yummy.  Tilapia was a lot better than I expected, seemed like it would be overwhelming if i ate the whole thing though.  My friend said the sirlon was good.  As for my rib eye steak I ordered medium rare but it was well done.  I felt bad to bother them at such a busy time but I couldnt eat the well done steak it was way too dry.  They were nice and made me a new steak but it took forever.. both my boyfriend and roommate were done with their food when my new steak came out. The new one was juicier but didnt have much flavor.  Not a big fan of chain resturants.. they always cook my steak too much, just my luck I guess.  Will not be returning.

My boyfriend and I were on a hunt for good pho in AZ, as California natives we are a bit picky.  Our taste buds were searching for the home taste we miss so dearly.  Finally we found Saigon Pho! We got the saigon special and regular pho tai.  The broth was very clear and the meats were not too tough.  I'm comparing this to UnPHOgettable, seems that place had a lot of good reviews but we aren't fans.  We also got the porkchop rice plate, the porkchop was very moist and not dry.  Service is kind of slow but its a HUGE place! My favorite was they give you oxtail in the saigon special which a lot of places don't.

I really needed an asian food fix after being in Chicago for a week.  I visited my boyfriend in Arizona for the first time when I ate here.  We ate here kind of late Saturday about 2pm.  The dim sum was ok.    My next visit was when I moved here, I came with my parents and my boyfriend again but we came this time at 11am.  Peak dimsum hours and I had such a different experience.  The food was SO good and comparable to the dim sum we had at home (San Gabriel Valley).  Even my parents were impressed.   The dim sum is hong kong parent approved!

My boyfriend and I decided to have a late breakfast and decided to come here on a weekday.  On the weekends this place is PACKED so we wanted to see what all the fuss is about.  I have read that service is slow and I can agree it was slowwwww.  We ordered egg scramble, open faced roast beef sandwich, and biscuits and sausage gravy.  Egg scramble- packed with the ingredients we ordered but the egg was very overcooked and rubbery.  Instead of home fries we got a pancake.  And I must say best pancake I have every eaten!  Open faced roast beef sandwich- Honestly the roast beef was at most average.  Their mashed potatoes and gravy were SO GOOD.  Such fluffy mashed potatoes and perfectly seasoned gravy.    Biscuits and sausage gravy- You know how this dish can always be overwhelming and heavy.. for some reason this was not! The biscuits were so light and fluffy and the sausage gravy was just perfection on top.    Curious to come here again.  Will be back for more southern cooking !

Flo's is a really authentic chinese resturant, they do have other cuisines such as vietnamese and thai, but stick to the Hong Kong Chinese Food.  I have not had anything I did not like here, as a chinese food veteran I am happy to have found this place! I constantly miss the LA 626 chinese food, the struggle is real.. trust me. Their prices for lunch are decent, my coworker and I tend to lean toward coming here every time we can't decide where to go.    What to eat:  Beef basil fried rice  Hainan Chicken, extra ginger sauce please!  Fried seafood noodle  Egg Foo Young (cooked soft)

As a LA native I have had the famous Roscoes chicken & waffles, this is BETTER.  I never thought I would ever say that.  Every time I come here we come in a big group, they are really accommodating and quick with the food.  The servers are really friendly and they have kool-aid on tap, if you're a fan.  The chicken is delicious, perfectly seasoned, perfectly fried, and perfectly juicy! The waffle was not soggy and compliments the chicken well.  The mac and cheese is so good.  Be ready to be so full you can't breathe though! Big portions and super heavy.  Its a must try if you are ever in Phoenix!

I had a korean bbq craving because I was so use to eating it so often in the Orange County, CA.  They must have had over 20 within a 10 mile radius, so with that said.. I can safely say that I have the ability to judge good or bad quality of meat.  The panchan was about the only good thing we got... the service is horrible, ignored over 10 times, took over 30 mins to get our check.  We ordered the brisket and pork belly.  When the order was brough over it was brownish... so I though eh if you cook it it will be fine.. WRONG. Both the brisket and pork belly was dry as sandpaper the sauces did not help.  It surprises me that porkbelly can be so dry?! The grill kept getting sticky but it took forever to flag a waiter down to change it.  I have yet to try the sushi but I will definately be sticking to CA for korean bbq now.    Pretty pricey too for such low quality meat.

They have really good quality pho.  The broth is amazing and not too salty like most places we've been to.  The meat is not rough and chewy , if you get the rare beef on the side so it doesn't cook too much in the broth it will turn out very tender.  They also have something called banh cuon which is a pork/meat wrapped in rice paper... as a California native like I always mention, I have had my fair share of good pho and vietnamese food.. they have REALLY good banh cuon!  Great place for pho and banh cuon.. I have yet to try the rice dishes.  But I will be back!

This place is not hyped.  Truly the best Gyro I have ever had.  Their chicken shawarma plate is plentiful too, enough to share with 3 people! We always get extra garlic sauce on the side because it goes good with everything.  I have not tried anything here I do not like.    Must tries: Gyro Sandwich Chicken Shawarma plate Pistachio Baklava   Extra garlic sauce please!

Delicious burger being cooked in front of you on a wood fire grill. Yes, please! I was curious about this place after seeing some pictures and was not disappointed.  A couple of notes:  - Cash Only  - It's not fast food, they cook the burger when you order it.   - Get french fries you won't regret it!    A place to go for a simple great burger, it's one of the best burgers I have had

My friend and I wandered in here due to their beautiful ambiance.  Quite dark and date like.  We decided to order some cocktails to start out, the waitress recommended two but I apologize the names totally slip my mind, they were phenomenal! Mine was something with strawberry that was very fresh with no alcohol taste.  My friends had ginger and blueberries but was also very good.  We both ordered pasta's she got the special with the rabbit and I got the linguine with salmon.  It came out pretty quick and it was quite tasty!  It had the perfect amount of flavor to both dishes, to my surprise the rabbit was not gamey.  I will be back to try more pastas and entrees!

It gets crowded early so if you don't want to be like vultures waiting for tables get here early (before 9pm).  They take requests with tip.  Very energetic yet not too crazy place to hang with friends.  The shots are less than 10 dollars too, I don't know about you but shots are usually 12+.  They play a mix of oldies and top 100.  I always have a good time here so its a go!  Tips: Bring your student ID you get in for free. No student ID? Check in on yelp 50% off admission price Go before 9pm for better seating

I first came here on my first day of work.  My managers took me out to lunch and all seemed to really love this place.  I got the filet mignon cobb salad, amazing! Honestly it's the best salad I've ever had.. it has a lot going on.  Along with the filet it comes with hardboiled egg, cherry tomatos, mushrooms, greens, croutons, and blue cheese (I get it without this).  The dressing was a bit overwhelming so I would suggest getting it on the side.  I have yet to try something else.  I will be sure to update once I do!

Full experience was a 2.5, food however is a one star.  The seats are very comfortable and you can recline all the way down.  The sound system in this theater is really good, creating a better movie watching experience.  On to the food, we got loaded chipotle chicken chips and tenderloin tips.  Chipotle chicken chips- All the flavor was there however,  the very first bite COLD, chips not crunchy, cheese had been melted but had already set. As I said all the flavor was there but everything else fell flat.    Tenderloin tips- This came with mashed potatoes and broccoli, I was excited for this dish as it was recommended by our waitress but everything tasted like it came from a microwaved dinner. The tenderloin tips were not tender at all and super chewy, mashed potatoes were starchy (like the ones from a mix) and broccoli cold.  I know this isn't a five star restaurant but I expected more from a dine in theater. We went to iPic a couple of weeks ago, the seats and sound were not as amazing but the food was 100X better.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things, maybe it was an off day, we are still in debate to come back a second time or not.

The first time I tried this place I was randomly searching "delivery" because I was super lazy.  We ordered carbonara and beef ravioli.  Though it did take a little over an hour to get to us, someone was nice enough to call us and let us know, they also gave us a free dessert! Back to the food, a decent portion of both the pasta and raviolis.  The flavors were perfect, you know when pasta is not to salty and not to bland..its exactly like that. Not to mention the leftovers the next day were phenomenal.  So after eating the delivery I found myself thinking about this pasta all week.  Finally decided to look up its location, to my surprise my husband and I have passed by this place many times (its right in between Petco and Fry's).  I wanted to try the pastas at the resturant. My grandpa came with me and he usually eats chinese food so his food palette is pretty singular, he loved this place.  We ordered the carbonara and chicken toscana, the carbonara was as good as the first time! The chicken toscana was way too salty, however they were so busy I didn't want to send it back and wait, I had to be somewhere.  None the less this place is cozy and yummy!

Was craving sushi and wanted to try a new place.  It was average.. nothing special.  It's a bit pricey too for the quality.  Happy hour seems to have some decent prices though.  I ordered a beef tataki which is normally raw beef... we got some cooked up korean bbq pieces which threw me off, don't get me wrong it was good.  The sashimi: salmon & ono (white tuna) two cuts that are usually melt in your mouth perfection.. kinda chewy? Dragon roll is at most average.  Spent too much for what I got.

Dimsum! Weekends are so busy, these people are legit cantonese/chinese which if you do not know is as authentic as you can get.  Dim Sum is a Hong Kong brunch (cantonese people).  I am a big fan of this place because all of your yummy dim sum items come out piping hot! I have gone to places where they are just warm.  We are really looking forward to trying dinner here one day.  Will become a regular here for dimsum :)

Arrived here for Sunday brunch on a hot Phoenix day.  There is a wait around 20-30 mins, pretty accurate with their timing which was nice.  We were offered a drink as we waited, spotted a kids area for those of you who have kids.  As we were seated there was a live jazz performance.  Began to look at the menu and was pretty skeptical with the menu as it seemed like pretty regular brunch. Boy were we in for a great surprise! We ordered:  Sparkling pineapple lemonade-  good to the last drop just absolutely refreshing and tasty for a hot Phoenix Day  Fried Egg Sandwich- my husband got this amazing sandwich, doesn't seem like it would be anything special right?  Wrong! It is pretty much one of the best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had, that bacon and chipotle aioli sauce is just amazing.    Eggs Benedict with Pork Loin-  our friend opted for this and it turned out to be quite tasty as well! The eggs were cooked perfectly (something we always look for in a benedict) and the pork loin was perfectly flavored with it.    Pork Chili Verde-  My choice, the pork chili came with corn bread and most importantly HOT! This dish was more spicy than I thought it would be which is a plus because I like spicy.  Those flavors packed into this tiny skillet.  You have to try and dip french fries into this, it was like pork chili fries.    Even with the wait, can't go wrong.  Absolutely love it here, they will be seeing me more often!

Decided to come here after craving something warm for the cold weather.  We have been to a few other korean places where I was disappointed in the tofu and bbq.  This place is as good as it gets for korean tofu in AZ! We got a soon tofu and spicy pork.    Pan chan (sides)- Yummy kimchi and potatoes  Seafood&beef tofu-  Amazing flavor and lots of clams!!  Spicy pork-  So flavorful and amazing !   Come here for the best korean food in the east valley! I'm pretty sure I will soon become a regular even though its quite a drive.

Typical chinese buffet their attempt at serving a lot of seafood for your money's worth  falls short because there are heeps of people lined up like there was a blow out sale for the crab legs.  Once you do get the crab legs they are over salted so you won't want to eat more.  The sushi was super fishy and other entrees dry as they are left out on the heating pad.  The one yummy thing is the mongolian bbq & fried chinese donuts.. but $20 for that? No thanks.

I gave up coffee about 2 years ago.. most of the coffees I drink now a days make me jittery because its too strong.  The Coffee Shop has such good coffee, kind of like a mix between tea+coffee! I atmosphere is really nice and open.  We ordered their American Breakfast and chorizo burrito.    American Breakfast- eggs were cooked to perfection and the wheat bread was so good, not dry like most kinds.    Chorizo burrito- overall really good but too much potato.  Should opt for no potato next time.    I liked it so much I told my boyfriend we have to come for brunch this weekend!

I was honestly not a fan of these when I lived in Cali.. but I think it was because I kept getting the red velvet.  Yes that is the cult favorite.. and my boyfriend loved it but for me its a little too heavy and buttery.  I tried their dark chocolate and my gosh.. I have been missing out.  You will see me back here more often... debating to visit the cupcake atm in Cali too, just cause.  I want to try all the other flavors now!

Went here on a Saturday night with some friends.  It was really crowded, lots of people on date night, families, and groups of friends.  There was an hour wait at 7pm so we headed over to the pool table to kill some time.  Decided to order some food.  The pool table price was decent $10 an hour and prorated if you leave early.  The food took some time, we got our lane and it didn't come yet.  We just told them our lane and they brought the food.  Bowling shoes were clean and lanes were nice.  The food was good..I mean you wont be expecting gourmet food at a bowling alley.  Satisfied Saturday night with some friendly competition.

I am truly disappointed in this experience.. I have heard so many amazing things about Mastro's and how their steak so amazing and perfect.  I was surprised that my experience was a complete opposite of the things I heard.  It's very nice when you walk in and the hostess are very nice.  We made a reservation in the lounge not knowing how loud it would be.  Squeezed into a tiny booth in the corner we sat down and realized how far we were when facing eachother but oddly enough how close we were to the next table.  5 mins pass.. no server, no one to ask us if we wanted water, 10 mins finally someone comes with no introduction just sticking the menu in our faces like, HERE, ORDER.  So.. at this point I felt uncomforable going to a place for my boyfriends birthday that didnt really seem to want us here.  We looked over the menu, everything, of course, al la carte, I was warned of the prices already.  We ordered a bone in rib eye, bone in filet, and lobster mashed potatoes.  Food took a long time to arrive.  Bone in rib eye-  Right when my steak came I could tell it was overcooked because medium rare is not hard to touch,  I was reluctant to send it back because I was so hungry and I didn't want to be a bother but my boyfriend assured me that if we're going to pay over $50 for a steak it should be perfect. My steak had become well done after we were able to flag a waiter down.  Brought me a new one and right away it was well done again....... also the waitress shined a brightlight at me and told me please cut down the middle so we can see.  At this point I felt so awkward, I didn't ask to change the steak because I don't want to be so difficult TWICE.  Overall the flavor was really good but overcooked.   Bone in filet-  My boyfriend ordered a medium rare as well and it was also overcooked but only to medium.  Because a filet is such a good cut of meat he didn't exchange it cause it was still enjoyable.  I have got to say this was the best piece of filet I have every eaten.    Lobster mashed potatoes- This was packed with flavor and chunks and chunks of lobster, really amazing.  No wonder its more than $30 bucks.    We ordered coffee so we wouldnt be coma induced from all our food, really really good coffee.  Since it was my boyfriends birthday they brought out a cake which was very nice.    So from feeling bad about sending my steak back my boyfriend and I both told our waitress thank you for sending it back.. we really appreciate it.. not only did she not acknowledge us she rolled her eyes.  Like WOW I'm sorry I want some quality for the 200 bucks I spent.  I really never had such bad service at a high end resturant.  Honestly.. I'm not sure how I feel about this place yet, the filet was REALLY good but the service threw off the experience.  And if this is a steak house.. they should really perfect medium rare.

I'm really surprised this place does not have at least 4 stars.  I went the traditional route and was recommended by a friend of mine about this place.  Came here for my birthday dinner while we were in Vegas and boy were we in for a treat! It's in the Palazzo Hotel, pretty easy to find.  We were seated across the way in a pretty private dining area.  The curtains were open at first and it was a bit awkward when people would walk by and stare so we decided to ask the waiter to close them.  We got the bone in 90 day aged rib eye for 2, beef cheek ravioli, spinach, and mashed potatoes.    90 day aged rib eye for 2- So my all time favorite is Ruth's Chris Steakhouse's Rib eye because its packed with flavor and cooked perfectly.  Our waiter informed us that their steaks are cooked a little raw so their medium rare is rare, medium is medium rare.. etc.  I'm a person who believes anything above medium ruins the steak but I know I know we all have our preferences.  Anyways, they bring the steak to the table and carve the entire piece for you.  Everything is PACKED with flavor because of the amazingly marbled cut.  I was trying to convince myself that Ruth's Chris was still the best rib eye I have ever had but sadly I think I have a new BEST.  It's sad because they only have this in Vegas ! All in all, don't come here without trying the rib eye.  Beef Cheek Ravioli- AMAZING, this was their specialty pasta for the day.  For those of you that do not know what beef taste like.. the flavor is packed because its a fatty area and very soft texture. Just plain buttery goodness!    The sides- Honestly I was took focused on my steak to even think about it. But I do remember not being a fan of the mashed potatoes, they were just too watery.   I think this is a must have every time I am in Vegas.

I got eyebrow thread, tint, and eyelash tint. The lady was extremely nice but everything turned out pretty horrible. I have never had such a long torturing eyebrow threading session and I have totally mismatched eyebrows now with missing chunks everywhere on my eyebrow. One side my arch is completely gone from her threading away at the top of my arch which I even asked why she was doing that. My eyelashes barely have color and my eyebrows have a bit of tint running down that looks like running paint.   Take your money elsewhere. I am honestly not one to complain about places but my eyebrows are so ugly I don't even want to go out.

I come here for lunch.  GREAT SELECTION! Their sushi is fresh, burgers are juicy, and salad bar is huge.  I have yet to try all the different options. There is fresh food for days you don't want to cook.  Though the ingredients are very fresh the price is what steers me away, can't seem to leave this place without burning a hole in my wallet.

I have heard a few things about this place from my coworker, she absolutely loves the Benedict.  My coworkers and I always pass by but never really end up eating here, mistake! It wasn't until I was at the Phoenix airport and I ran into a New Yorker and we randomly started chatting about food in Arizona ...and she claimed they have pizza that is comparable to NY.  Well well... I thought must try this next week!  You walk into a really clean and open ambiance, I love the natural lighting.  The staff was very friendly, however I wish they would recommend us dishes more, everyone we asked kind of said everything is just good.  Lots of options from sandwiches to pizzas to breakfast foods.  Now on to the food!   Endive Salad- my coworker got this, she is vegetarian and she loved the apple combination with the blue cheese, they gave her two different kinds of salad dressings one was something like a honey mustard and the other was this spicy mustard and horse radish.  The spicy mustard one went well with everything! We dipped our pizza in it, our french dip, and the french fries.  Overall a very fresh salad, the blue cheese taste is really strong so a caution if you are not into that.    French dip-  I really enjoyed the dip, sometimes french dip sauce is overly salty but this was a clear beef broth that was simmered to perfection.  I liked the overall sandwich but I'm a fan of medium rare beef.  This french dip was well done, it wasn't dry though so that was good, I wish they could somehow have their beef with a medium rare option.  Comes with french fries and a salad.    Pizza- The name of the pizza totally slipped my mind.  It's the 3rd one up from the bottom of the menu, the one with the egg in the middle (sorry!).  We got extra basil on top for some extra freshness.  I am a big fan of brick oven pizza and this one takes the prize.  The crust is perfectly flaky and the sauce is not too sour like most places.  I don't want to hype this up so just go try it and see for yourself.  Hopefully you come out as happy as I was.    Overall, I feel like when I'm done eating pizza and sandwiches at other places it feels heavy and I have a super lethargic afternoon. Cafepino does not have that heavy feeling and that usually correlates with fresh ingredients! I am looking forward to trying more things on the menu, see you again soon.

I guess they really do have those hidden fees, came with a big group for celebrating and they asked us about the lunch special pasta with a special sausage.  3 of us got the pasta.. it taste just like the 8.99 lunch special however we were charged $26. The sausage it self was over $5.  We were never informed by the waiter. I honestly really loved this place before this but I'm not so sure anymore.

Due to our current health craze this was an awesome place that fit right in to our needs.  All their dishes are so refreshing and yummy. My favorite is their roasted pepper hummus.. omg amazing! I can't really comment on one dish because they are all really yummy.  Will update after I've gone a few more times

Exactly like a panera minus the awesome green tea.  Their sandwiches are good, so are their soups, but I never feel like anything is fresh.  I know their soups come frozen and they just heat it.  Still satisfies when you need to drop in for a quick lunch.

My boyfriend and I stumbled in here on a weekday night and ate at the bar.  We got Santa fe chicken dip, prime rib sliders, and a burger.  Whoa were we blown away! So much flavor.  We really enjoyed ourselves and decided to come again for dinner.  Their prime rib is very good.. and this is coming from a person who LOVES prime rib.  It's the first chain restaurant that I really love.  Comes in big portions and their cocktails are quite yummy.

The happy hour is awesome! Great price for awesome food.  My boyfriend and I were just running errands at the apple store and we stumbled upon this amazing italian resturant.  We decided to sit at the bar during happy hour.  We ordered eggplant fries, beef carpaccio, and a burger.   eggplant fries- breaded and comes with a yummy garlic aioli   beef carpaccio- really yummy.. super thinly sliced beef with fresh arugula  burger- we were pretty blown away by how good this burger was.  Great price for great quality!  We will be back to try more items on the menu :)

I am reviewing this based on on happy hour, will update when I go to the actual steak house later.  This was recommended to me by a friend.   We decided to go here for my husband's birthday, he didn't want anything too fancy so we opted for the happy hour here. My tummy was truly satisfied! We went with 3 people and we all left super happy.   Popovers- It's very airy bread... best way to describe it.... just because it is bread don't let it fool you. This was awesome!!!  Crabcakes- More filler than crab, I say no go.   Burger- Juicy goodness and packed with flavor  Escargot- I've had my fair share of these, the ones here aren't cleaned as well as they should be, still decent at its best   Truffle fries- YUM, its a go! Comes out hot, crunchy, packed with truffle flavors   Flat bread- A lot of mushrooms so if you don't like mushrooms be careful, I LOVED it.  Honestly the best flat bread I've had.    I will be back for more!

I had their Bo luc lac.  Not impressed, the flavor was really off.  Maybe this is because grew up in the San Gabriel Valley and lived near Garden Grove for 2 years.  But all in all I wouldn't go back.

Not sure about this place and its amazing reviews.  The service was slow and food came out cold.  We got a pizza and burger both came out super cold, it took so long that we didn't even send it back because we were starving.  Might do a retry but nothing was so amazing that made me want to go back.

Breakfast comes out HOT and FAST, I love this place for their traditional breakfast and skillets.  I was disappointed with their steak and eggs and burrito.  But stick with a skillet or traditional sausage & eggs and you will be fine.  Warning: portions are huge!

Normal American breakfast. I do like this location more than the other because their food comes out HOT! There is nothing worse than warm breakfast.  A couple of favorites:  Carnitas Skillet  Pancakes  Sausage Links

The pizza here alone is worth coming for.  Stone fire pizza is always a yes in my book!  Everything about our pizza was good from the mushrooms, sausage, shrimp, and sauce.  We also ordered the duck sandwich and lasagetta.  Duck sandwich was a bit too sweet for me, nothing super special I can say about it.  Lasagetta ... turned out NOT to be lasagna as we thought..it was little sausage pieces that covered veggies and thick lasagna pasta.. no sauce, no go if you ask me.  I would definately come back for the pizza!

We picked this place for Friday night date night, awesome atmosphere.. it was SOOO romantic.  A bit cold because we got sat outside, no heaters were on.  The inside wasn't as romantic it reminded me of a bar.  The hostess had the cutest accent and was really sweet.  Our waiter seemed kind of stiff, we tried to joke with him but no response.. made it a bit awkward but on to the food.  We ordered Foi Gras, mushroom risotto, lamb chops, and creme brulee.    Foi Gras- I've been dying to try this as they recently outlawed it in California, actually this was the reason I picked this resturant.  I was pretty disappointed just tasted like fat with weird texture.  However, I am not opposed to trying it somewhere else so I can develop a better palette for judging foi gras.    Mushroom risotto-  Very very very yummy! My boyfriend and I are pretty obsessed with risotto and this one was totally up to par with our expectations.  So buttery and perfect amount of cheese.    Lamb chops-  This was cooked to perfection, medium rare.  There was this berry reduction sauce on one side that was very tastey.  Another side was a green sauce, not a big fan.. kind of felt like drinking a cleanse juice.  It was ok though we avoided that side and went for the berry sauce.  This dish was amazing but the only thing that bothered us was that it came with 2 lamb chops, really? For $35 bucks you could at least give us 3.. maybe 4.    Creme Brulee- nothing special, a little lemon hint to it.   We also had the coffee which was very interesting, it was from a local coffee bean shop, it tasted really light kind of like tea.  I actually thought they gave us tea so we had to ask.    Overall I recommend this place for date night/ first dates.  They have french music playing in the background made it feel like we were in Paris.  Reminded me a lot of the movie Ratatouille.  Perfect romantic atmosphere for dates.

Decided to get a membership after a year of contemplation because my skin is just parched and I needed an esthetician bad. The front desk people are the sweetest ! So nice and accommodating.  Don't have anything bad to say since everything went well.    I did read some negative reviews about bad massages and such, some advice, always speak up to your massage therapist or estetician.. if you are going to hold in something you dont like during the entire session of course you are going to hate it, they are not mind readers.  Another thing to consider is that a good massage therapist/estetician is something that's "in the eye of the beholder".  I learned this from previous experiences... had some massages that were just terrible, felt tickled the entire time, and no relaxation.. had others that were just heavenly and relaxing.  I realized every massage therapists technique is different, so you kind of have to "shop" around for one that meets your liking before you make your decision on the entire place itself.  Once you find a good one stick with them! You can't always expect a perfect massage the first time but sometimes you do get lucky!

I loveeee their burgers, we always come here when we want a hearty meal.  I have yet to try the italian beef but we took a friend here once and she said she really liked it.  They have crickle cut fries and the workers are always super friendly.   Protip: ask for the special fries sauce, its super yummy!

Prices are expensive and food is not good.... I do like the outdoor seating and its great for groups but they need to step up with their food. Everything sounds so yummy on the menu but when it comes out its bland, maybe its what we ordered?  The waitress also took forever to give us our check.  I'm not sure I need some convicing to come back.

I went here for brunch with my friend visiting from out of state.  It was worth it, I was kind of iffy at first with the price being $30/person but the prime rib, lobster claws, and king crab alone is worth the price.  They did have unlimited mimosas and bloody marys.  The buffet actually is comparable to the Vegas buffets, good entrees to choose from,  fresh seafood, omelet bar, big selection of desserts.  Will be back whenever I have the mood to overeat :)!

I came across this place browsing for cajun places to eat.  I have eaten the famous Oyster Bar at Palace Station in Vegas.  To my surprise, Ocean Trail is actually comparable.  Both times we came our tummies left happy.  It is considered a bar so you cannot eat there unless you are 21 and over.  We've had the panroast, clam chowder, oysters, seafood corn chowder.  Clam chowder- this was decent.. but I honestly think most clam chowders taste the same   Oysters- Being a California native I felt this could be fresher but with no bodies of water around Arizona .. this is probably as good as it gets.  The oyster meat was HUGE, big plus.   Seafood corn chowder- I would opt for this over the clam chowder, creamy yet every bite was filled with seafood.  Perfectly seasoned !  Panroast-  I saved the best for last! This was AMAZING.  Perfect taste for those who like tomato based dishes.  I got mine with crawfish and my boyfriend got his with crab.  Both were good, the crawfish was lighter and crab was denser.  The second time we came we got the combination which I liked a lot better.  This is a MUST TRY!  So far the best panroast/seafood I have eaten in Arizona.

One night I was suddenly craving for some garlic naan.  We came across this place and decided to try out the buffet.  It went beyond my expectations, very authentic.  The price is really good too for all the food you can get.  The garlic naan was so yummy! Recommended place for indian buffet.  Price is right and food is awesome!

I use to eat at the South Coast Plaza in OC California a lot, every time we had a birthday, baby shower, or promotion we would seem to gravitate toward seasons 52.  The Phoenix location has the usual nice atmosphere and waiters.  All their dishes are under 500 calories, nicely portioned.  Menu changes every season so all the ingredients are always super fresh.  Can't go wrong here if you want a healthy and nice meal out.  I honestly haven't gotten anything here I don't like I am always left wanting more.. is it their small portions or amazing taste? I have yet to find out.

Cute little farmers market, since it was only about a 10 min drive from our house we decided to check out the local produce.  Seemed like we were late because most of the veggies that we wanted to buy were gone.  We ended up getting this really yummy scorpian pepper compound butter, we use it in a lot of our dishes now.  It's pretty pricey but its always like that at farmers markets, paying for the freshness and quality.  We also tried some homemade spagetti sauce, also very good.  I'm not sure if the venues change.  We will be back once we finish up our compound butter, that it self is worth a trip!

I was suprised at how good this place was.  A little bit pricey but well worth it.  They had a pricer shabu meat but the prime beef was already good enough.  The japanese miso soup base was so good, udon and veggies tasted great after simmering in the broth.  They do have boba here which I would advise against getting it, the tea/milk tea itself was very good but the boba was old and hard.

This has been pretty much a weekly lunch destination for me and my coworkers.  A couple of our favorites:  Crunchy tofu extra crunchy Spicy pork spring mix bowl  Spicy pork ramen   The owner does seasonal ramens and dishes,  I recommend trying them.. we have not been disappointed yet.  Great place to go for Japanese/Korean food. The flavors are very consistent.

My boyfriend and I love breakfast, we are big egg connoisseurs.  Decided to check out what all the hype is about at Butters.  Came here around 10am and it was already pretty packed.. wait time around 20 mins.  Not so bad compared to places in LA.  As we were seated I ordered the fresh squeezed orange juice, yum.  We debated away on the choices on their massive menu.  Our picks:  Whole hog skillet: one word... WOW! The hash browns were crunchy goodness with a buttery center and meats were good.  Topped with eggs made to your liking (I got a soft scramble).  One of the best breakfast skillets I have ever had!  2 egg breakfast with sausage & protein pancakes: My boyfriend got a more generic breakfast because he is watching what he eats.  He did mention the sausage patty was like McDonalds.. we all know Mcdonalds is not good for you but their breakfast sausage is amazing!  The eggs were cooked to his liking (over easy).  To his surprise he really liked the protein pancakes, syrup was not needed.    So far this place has blown my mind.. but we'll give it a few more tries and update this review :). But for now... we're coming back for more!

I'm a pretty reasonable person when it comes to service because growing up in 626 of LA I've had my fair share of rude Asians. I came in on a Saturday morning for a gel manicure and regular pedicure. My gel manicure felt rushed the entire time and my French tip was too thick. I kept telling the lady but she would insist it's fine and pretty much look at me and continue her work :/. I'm sorry but there are 10 nails places in a 5 mile radius so.... Customer services makes a difference. My pedicure was fine except the scrub part was kind of rough, after I told the lady it was fine. Will continue my search for a go to nail place.  They do have a cheap price for gel manicure $22, you get what you pay for.  Update: On the board coming in it was $22 gel and $30 for pedicure. They ended up charging me $60 because somehow for that lady who did my nails (who was super rushing!!) it's $25 and I don't even know why my pedicure was $35. Didn't give me another chance to ask. And just charged me.   As you can see I'm very fair with reviews and rarely give 1 star to places. But I am VERY UNSATISFIED.  Not only was my service rushed and rude, I was over charged with no reasoning. Hidden charges. Will not be back.  UPDATE: 2 days later. My index finger of the french gel nail was peeling.. kind of like a peeling sticker. So I went back. As I arrive I said very nicely "Hi, I was here on Saturday and my nail chipped". Blank stare and eye roll from the guy, here let me see he says. I show him my hand and he proceeds try and fill the nail. I stop him and said no it's peeling too ( I should have been more detailed) so he sighs and says ok then we ll have to re do the nail. I said ok. So I'm sitting here feel all these angry eyes on me and the lady who did my nails on Saturday starts speaking in Vietnamese to him as they all give me dirty looks. He then tells me "it's chipped because you took your hand out to text, the light didn't shine on it long enough because you wanted to text, you shouldn't do that when you get these nails". WOW, I'm speechless.....not only did they mess up and not admit to it but they also blamed it on the customer.  Not only was I angry but embarrassed because the guy said it to me out loud with a bunch of people around.  100% NO! Take your business elsewhere to a place that treats customers with respect.

Great venue, there is seating for those who don't like to stand and a whole lot of standing areas.  We came here early and our friend suggested we eat at the bar in front turned out they have amazing burritos! We have had the chicken, carne asada, and al pastor.. one as good as the next.  Their salsas they serve with it is out of this world.  Their drinks are also well mixed and very tasty.  My personal favorite is the Honey Badger.  We will likely be looking out for more shows for this venue from now on.

We had to drop our roommate off at the airport so we just yelped places around.  So glad I came across this gem.  You order first then seat yourselves, didn't seem overcrowded which was awesome because seats popped open.  We got the omelette and chipotle bacon burrito.    Omelette- I'm super pickey with eggs.. this was SO good! Everything from the eggs to cheese to veggies were perfect.  I got wheat bread which sometimes can be grainy and dry, it was super moist and tasted great with the omelette, couldnt be happier.    Chipotle bacon burrito- Awesome burrito the chipotle sauce complimented the dish so well and the tortilla was so soft.    A bit on the oily side but its ok, its breakfast!   Definately want to come back to try the eggs benedict.

Since i moved from Cali I was on the search for someone to keep up my ombre and hair cut. I'm so glad I found Holly. I have been going to her for over a year now and I leave happy with my hair every time. I will not go anywhere else ! She is the best.   A little note on those that have naturally dark hair and want a platinum blonde ombré ... The first time will come out more orange-ish blonde because.. Like most things it takes time to develop (this is for hair that is completely virgin and/or super dark). By the 2nd and third time it will come out to better and better... Be patient ! Go back to Holly she will work to develop your hair into the exact color you want.

My husband and I were searching for pizza to eat on a Friday night since we wanted a night in.  Didn't want to go with the typical, Pizza Hut/Dominos/Papa Johns. Our neighbor had mentioned Papa Murphy's and how the price was good and pizza even better.  We decided to try it out.  Arriving there we could pick the pre-made pizzas and also make some changes of our own (no olives please!)  You would honestly think that this pizza is like any other pizza... I honestly never like to write about pizza cause there's really nothing too special about it.  All in all pizza is hard to mess up.  This pizza is DELICIOUS, from the sauce to the crust to the toppings. SO FRESH and plenty enough, not to mention with our local coupons it was $13 for a family size aka huge!  I am currently eating one for breakfast as I write this review.  We got the regular cowboy, no olives, add pineapple.  So my pizza tests consist of how it tastes, straight out of the oven,  20 mins later, next day.  Papa Murphy's passed all 3 with flying colors!! We will be back.  Sorry no more chain pizza's for us as long as Papa Murphy's an option.

We were just browsing through yelp one night looking for a place with good burgers.  We stumbled upon Mike's and decide to give it a try.  Upon arrival we were promptly greated by the friendly staff.  We ordered a cheeseburger, cheesesteak, and chili cheese fries.  They also serve thrifty/riteaid ice cream! Honestly we didn't think much or have any expectations for this place.. but boy did they give us a suprise.    Cheeseburger- the most moist, perfectly cooked, delicious burger I have had in the east valley! I even liked it better than Rehab burger. My boyfriend agrees!  Cheesesteak-  Theres something about that fluffy buttery bread they put everything in.. grilled onions and cheese so good! The beef was so tender too!  Chili cheese fries- this was the only thing I didn't really like because they used nacho cheese/ cheese wiz on top.  I think this is personal though, I am really not a big fan of none stringy cheese.  The fries were good though!  The only thing I wished for here was for their cheese to be stringy! But other than that you have a great place to bring kids! Awesome food and ice cream!

We went here for a non traditional Wednesday date night.  Booked the class online a couple weeks back.  When you arrive you are greeted by friendly staff who take you to your seats, you  receive a drink voucher (first drink is included). The instructions are very clear and they give you lots of time to put our own personality into the paintings.  The instructor was very helpful and clear.  Overall a very fun night out for my fiance and I.  Now we are able to add personalized home decor to our condo! I definitely recommend this for date nights!

This place is so worth your money!  They give you a lot of little appetizers before your meal arrives, for example pate w cheese and crackers, bread with really yummy pesto, and a sorbet to cleanse your pallet before your steak arrives.  We got the rib eye and filet mignon, both were cooked perfectly to what we order.  I'm pretty picky about the way my steak is cooked, medium rare ! Services was a bit slow, seemed understaffed but they were very nice. Will come back to try more things.

My husband keeps insisting that I update my review since we went back this weekend and I really enjoyed it.  Lets start with the best thing, the wings! Yes! I change my mind because this time I ordered it the way I like it.  I'm not a big fan of their sauces, they are all too sour or sweet (totally subjective), one of our friends suggested we try the wings naked and get the sauces on the side to dip if we liked.  So we tried that and AMAZING, now I finally understood why everyone loved their wings so much.  We also got a pizza this time and that was really good too!  My husband is so excited and happy that I will no longer refuse coming here.    Tips:  1. Get AZ smoked wings naked, sauce on the side so you can try more than one.  2.  Try the pizza! 3. Happy hour Sundays.  BEST DEAL! 3.50 Jameson shots.

I am a big fan of their bruschetta, very unique that they put ingredients other than the boring old tomatoes on top.  They have a lot of different wines and craft beers.  There is also a really good happy hour which is good for celebrations with a group.  It gets pretty crowded at dinner time.  The sandwiches are huge in portion and salads are very tasty.  It was the first place my boyfriend took me to when I was visiting in AZ so I guess it also has some sentimental value.  The atmosphere is really romantic and really good for date night, the noise level is moderate so you don't have to shout across the table trying to talk to each other.  The breakfast food is not too bad either, pretty healthy balanced breakfast.  I just love the decor and feel of the place.  There are huge garage like doors that open up to the outside patio.  The staff are also very attentive and nice.    What to order: Bruschetta - my favorites include brie and apple, warm creamy artichoke, prosciutto and figs Paninis - roast beef

The price is cheap but my food came out cold.  Cold eggs = fear of salmonella.  I am definately a fan of breakfast food but I came out disappointed.  The orange juice was fresh at least.

I think it would have been really fun with a big group.  We went on a slow Thursday night and got sat next to random people.  The chef was entertaining, tossing food and shooting sake into your mouth.  I have been to other teppanyaki places such as the Benihana chain and other various ones in California.  This one was by far the best I have been to.  The quality of food was really good, they have the best fried rice I've ever tried.  We got prime steak, chicken, and shrimp.  The steak was really good quality that it melted in your mouth.  Chicken was a bit dry for my taste.  Shrimp was cooked well, not over cooked and rubbery.    We came here for lunch on a Sunday to try out the sushi.  As a California native I had high expectations for fresh sushi and was skeptical about sushi in AZ because come on how can it be fresh without bodies of water around?  I was wrong,  it was really fresh sushi.  We had Ono(white tuna), tuna, and yellowtail, absolutely delicious! I was feeling adventurous that day as well so we got the live uni, when I tried it previously it was pretty "ocean like"  but this time it was really good.  It was my boyfriends first time trying it and he thought it was good.    It was kind of pricey but all teppanyaki and Japanese places seem to be.    Excited for the next time we go!

Really awesome burgers! The atmosphere was kind of hawaiian barish.  The staff are really nice and attentive.  We got the pb&j burger and I really forgot the second one.. he said it was like a big mac.    Pb&j- SO good, gotta say it has super umami flavoring.  Has to be the peanut butter and shiracha.  A warning though it can get overwhelming so I would share this.   Big mac?-  Nothing special just a burger with lots of toppings and overwhelming sauce.  So I guess not knowing the name of it isn't that bad.    It can get crowded so I'd come early if you dont want to wait.  I remember these people right behind me and up in my personal bubble.. felt so weird. But I guess the awesome burger made up for it

I was debating between 4 and 5 stars because of the long wait but then I reminded myself great things are worth waiting for !   They have very limited seating and a huge crowd.  We woke up pretty early on a Sunday and I wasn't expecting it to be so packed. So it's the kind of restaurant where you order and pay first then a serve brings you be food.   It has a very hipster feel and if you check in on yelp they give you a free coffee or tea. We got the pomegranate green tea, loved it. The tea wasn't watery as most ice teas are. I  have yet to try the coffee apparently it's all European.   We got the savory breakfast burrito and papa k with scrambled eggs. The crepes were amazing !!!   Breakfast burrito- I thought the breakfast burrito was a bit overwhelming because of all the avocado but my boyfriend who is a big fan of avocado loved it, the chipotle sauce perfectly complimented the flavors. He felt that the avocado balanced the crepe very well resulting in it not being too overwhelming. So I guess this one is open to your own opinion.  Papa k - inside was ham, pepper jack, scrambled eggs, cheese, and mushroom ragout. My first bite was the sides where they crisped up the cheese. Explosion of flavor in your mouth. It was satisfying from beginning to end. Must try !   In past experience savory crepes are always good at the beginning and overwhelming at the end.  Did not feel that here ! I finished every single bite.   Overall a must try, long wait but your stomach will thank you after.

I guess its not bad for an airport resturant.  The service was so bad.. it took us 10 mins each time to flag down the waitress.  We got shrimp tacos that were pretty good except it only had 1 shrimp in each of them... I'd head over to gate A&B to eat at Four Peaks instead

It was the typical hookah lounge ambiance,  the flavors didn't seem to be very prominent.  They kept pushing us to have a hookah for every 2 people.  We had a pretty big group but half of them didn't smoke.  The staff was attentive with changing up the coals but when it came to paying the bill it took over 30 mins because the manager had to close us out.  They had a DJ and he played pretty good music if EDM is your taste.  We got some sort of loaded fries, really good as well.

The feel of this bar is different from the rest of the bars on Mill Ave.  It's more relaxing than "yeah lets party and get wasted".  They make a phenomenal moscow mule, bartenders are very attentive and super nice.  Will make this a first stop for all our nights out on Mill Ave

A taste of home! I am definitely California grown and needed my shaved SNOW.  It's not the same as shaved ice.. not big pieces but little snow pieces that melt in your mouth.  They had the best green tea snow I have ever had.  One of the workers told me they will have brick toast soon.  I warn you native Arizonans... brick toast is AMAZING! Will be back for more snow, brick toast, and boba tea

So when I was a teen I worked at a McDonalds and from that experience you get to eat things when they are fresh off the grill.  It's a BIG difference, trust me. I really like this McDonalds because they keep their foods fresh.  The workers could be a bit nicer but I remember when I use to work there, you're tired from standing for hours, oily from frying fries all day, and have to smile at those crazy customers.. but it does make the experience better when you have a nice staff at the drive-thru window, I mean be nice to those who are nice to you, smile!  They are open 24 hours Friday and Saturday AND they have SAUSAGE EGG MCMUFFIN at 12am! Best idea ever.. in a sense... because now on Fridays I like to stay up until 12am just to eat that oily breakfast sandwich.  Satisfying yet a bad habit.

I have heard so many talk about how much they love acai bowls.  I don't have a sweet tooth so I was never so inclined to go try it.  My sister however has a sweet tooth and is on a health binge.  We decided to check this place out for a healthy snack and we were so satisfied and happy! The fruits are super fresh, granola is to die for, and the acai smoothie at the bottom was yummmmy! If you're looking to be really healthy the acai bowl is a good meal replacement.

This is the front porch of Monti's, my boyfriend and I were pretty confused looking for it.  It's outdoors with a bunch of heating lamps, be sure to sit next to one if you get cold easily.  So we came here for the tapas aka small plate appetizers.  The thing that surprised us was that the tapas were not small at all! We almost ordered too much.  Our food:  Prime rib Quesadillas- packed with flavor really good the first few bites in but after a little bit it got overwhelming.  If they didn't try to pack so much cheese and veggies into it it might have gotten 5 stars.  Sometimes less is better. I would order this for a group though.. really good!  Salmon tartar- my least favorite dish we ordered.  Packed ingredients in a mason jar which was a great presentation but the salmon didn't seem so fresh was very fishey.    Short rib tacos-  This was well worth $5 packed with meat and toppings.  The meat could have been a little more moist but I'm honestly not going to complain for the sake of the price.   There are a lot of selections we are definately coming back to try! Maybe this time with a bigger group.  I would give it 3.5 stars.. but I rounded up.    Great place for a big group to hang out, have some drinks, and share food!  Will be back to try the rest of the tapas

Great place to go for a good healthy fix.  Our friends recommended this place and we were skeptical at first.. but the American salad and protein bowl has won us over.  I prefer the tri tip over the chicken.  They also have pressed juices, my fav is the slim squeeze! Warning: very sour which I like but might not be your taste.    A great place for some healthy good food

The food was yummy but not the best.  They had a lot of different selections of Taiwanese food.  We got the steamed pork baos (xiao long bao), potstickers, and beef noodles.  I enjoyed each of them but it wasn't over the top WOW!  Steamed pork baos- a lot better than ones you make at home that's for sure but dont expect the perfection of Din Tai Fung, this was my favorite  Potstickers- The outer part was cooked perfectly, however, the filling could have used more salt/seasoning.  Even though you dip it in soy sauce/vinegar somehow there's water inside that comes out and makes it bland.   Beef noodles- Spicy (for my taste) but good.  Don't expect a traditional beef noodle broth, it's more like a hot and sour soup taste.  Different from the norm but yummy, I can just imagine rainy days and this dish, YUM.  Great place if you want to try Taiwanese food.  Decently priced too.

A couple of friends wanted to triple date and suggested this place.  I reminded myself to bring my expectations down as we were regulars at the famous boiling crab in OC/LA.  The initial experience was the same, no utensils, a big white paper and a bucket for the shells.  We got the trifecta with blue crab, crawfish, and wanted clam (they were out :( boooooo ).  The crawfish was HUGE and so tasty, the sauce was perfect even better than the one were use to.. less butter more flavor!  The blue crab was good.. if you were able to get any meat out but it is not their fault.  Blue crab is difficult to eat to begin with.    The waitress was friendly, food was good, we will be back for more! Hopefully they have some clam this time !

We made a second trip here as we were all craving the flavorful seafood.  This time they had clam! We were so excited. This time we got crawfish and clam medium trifecta. The clam was so good we ended up ordering more.  One of our bags of crawfish did come out cold, didn't think much of it cause everyone ate a few thinking it was just that one crawfish.. toward the end of the bag I voiced it and everyone said theirs was cold too.  That means the whole bag was practically cold, we told the waitress just so she could let the kitchen know and not serve cold crawfish to other diners.  She was SO nice and brought out another HOT steaming bag of crawfish, we were stuffed but happy.    Thank you Angry Crab Shack for the amazing customer service and awesome seafood! We will be back soon enough.

I was expecting a normal experience.. You know, nothing super amazing cause I always compare it back to Cali. Not to be repetitive about my California roots but it's important when I judge Asian food.  Being from San Gabriel Valley I can certainly say I have had my fair share of banh mi sandwiches (there's one on every block down valley). My family loved to get them for everything from simple Saturday lunches to day long amusement park trips (Disneyland, yes we were the Asians that snuck banh mi in.. No shame :)). Ok sorry for the trip down memory lane. On to the food! My boyfriend got Op La (#1 with two over easy eggs, not on menu) this is his childhood favorite.. The excitement I saw on his face after he ordered and they actually knew what he was talking about. So as he sunk his teeth into the bread I can see his face light up ... Picture the scene from Ratatouille when Ego takes the bite into the dish and it flashes back into his childhood.. Yep! Cue same scene but replace with my boyfriend and his banh mi. He said "omgosh I have never had such good Op La!!" I didn't have as dramatic of a first bite but my taste buds were sure screaming of joy. I got the cold cut which is my personal favorite. It was verryyyy good. Their pâté yum! I don't want to over hype this place for you now... But I am definitely a banh mi veteran from my time in California. Good meat and the bread was crunchy on the outside yet soft on the inside. This is definitely going to be our go to banh mi place.   Tips: try adding an egg to your sandwich and try eating there instead of to go..keeps bread crunchy!   My happy tummy says we will be back !

This brings me back memories of Boiling Point in SoCal, the taste is almost identical! The whole time I was eating I was telling my fiance how much I LOVED it.  The service is kind of slow as they are pretty understaffed but the food overshadows that.  We got the spicy beef pot, seafood pot, and kimchi pot  Spicy Beef-  Pretty spicy for my taste, doesn't come with enough beef but fiance loved it.  Seafood pot- was my favorite comes with a lot of clams, shrimp, crab, and some pork.   Kimchi pot- comes with kim chi of course, hot dogs (asian hot pot staple, weird I know), and pork.    I am usually a beef lover but their pork cooks better than their beef does.    The takoyaki is not worth ordering... now this appetizer is normally crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  This one was just soft... flavors were there but texture fell flat.    We will be back every week!

This place seemed promising with 4 stars.  They have happy hour all day and decently priced.  However, spicy tuna was very sweet (didnt taste normal) and their raw fish was warm.  It was completely empty with only my husband and I.  Staff was friendly but I'm sorry I can't do warm sashimi.

Good sandwiches and smoothies however beware of the wait.  The workers are very friendly always a warm welcome.  The one thing about there sandwiches is that it can get salty because they use a lot of sauce, but just ask for the sauce on the side and problem solved! They have a lot of great deals with sandwiches and free smoothies

My husband has been raving about this place for a while and we were finally able to make it there.  It's absolutely delicious, it has climbed its way to the top restaurants in phoenix in my book.  I think the chicken is cooked with a "double fry" method, this keeps it both tender and extra crispy. I had the leg and thigh with the plain donut (I wanted to try the default instead of being adventurous).  I opted for the sauce on the side so we can try them all, my favorite was the vietnamese.   MUST TRY if you are in Phoenix!!

Today is one of the happiest days of my life. I absolutely love Earls. My 21 year old memories were made at the Las Vegas Earls. When they opened one in downtown Disney I was ecstatic, however, that location is not as good. Today I tried the Tempe location and it is just as good as the Las Vegas Earls. All these nostalgic memories came rushing back to me from my first bite of the Original. Words can describe the amazing flavors that are packed in that sandwich. So I've had these sandwiches both sober and after a few too many drinks in. Let's just say sober they are really really good. After a few drinks they are heaven on earth. I mention this because Thurs-Sat they are open until 3am.   Decently priced. Try it out ! You won't be disappointed.    To try: The Original 1762, Chipotle Chicken Avocado, if you like loaded meat the Full Montegu is for you!   Accompaniments: Tomato soup and broccoli cheddar soup!

I have used 2-3 other companies for my semi annual carpet cleaning.  Every time other companies come they up-charge us from what was quoted. Arizona Steamers the cost is what he quotes you! We have a puppy so we have some stains and no one has been able to get it out .. ever.  Mike got everything out! Our carpets have never been cleaner and it dried in one night.  He also helped us clean our area rug, I was going to get rid of it because no one was able to get the stains out.. but of course he was able to! Number is saved ! I will be calling Mike every 6 months !

Got eyelash extensions here after a entire year of contemplating.  Before starting I did ask a bunch of questions because I have heard cluster lashes are big no nos and individual is the way to go.  Not only was my esthetician knowledgeable and friendly, she did an amazing job.  It wasn't painfully long because we had good conversation.  I will be back for fills.  I also need to come back for a threading.

I researched eyelash extensions for a long time and I was always scared my lashes would fall off from bad application. However, I found Lauren and she is the best ! I am addicted to false lashes now because she does such a great job. Also, I am never bored when I go see her. You won't be disappointed !

After going here 4 times in 2 weeks I decided I finally have to write a review.  Their burritos are amazing! The drive-thru times could be quicker but like I have said a million times before good things are worth waiting for.  A little observance I have done on mexican food.. after talking to people and having them tell me "this is the best taco place everrrrr!" then actually going and thinking meh... I think it depends on where you grew up whether its Cali-Mex, Sonoran, Chihuahua style, Tex-Mex, etc..  I grew up on Southern California's "Cali-Mex" which is LOTS of AVOCADOS, lots of carne asada, light on the beans, and sometimes fries in the burrito.  In my opinion..as everyone has their own.. this place is more Cali-Mex, which is why I love it so much.  My California friends visit and they absolutely loved this place too! They will definitely see us here more frequently.    My only true complaint is I wish they opened later for those late night after drinking cravings :P  To Try: Crispy Breakfast Burrito Surf and Turf Burrito - CURRENT FAVORITE Hash brown Breakfast Burrito
