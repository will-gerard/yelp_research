Having just purchased my first home, we have spent a lot of time picking up supplies for odd updates here and there. The guys and girls in the paint and garden center are always very friendly and helpful. More than the norm for other Home Depots and that other home improvement store. My home is between 2 of them and I will almost always head to this one because I know I will be well taken care of.

This place is a go-to for me on days I can't get out of work on time to go home for lunch. The 2 stars are for the insta-shits I got after eating a mostly mediocre whopper with cheese today. In all seriousness, beware. It was no bueno.

First time trying out this place. The line out front was a little off-putting, but once I saw the size of the place it all made sense. First off, their morning glory mimosa is freaking delicious. Ice cold and refreshing. I also had the chicken fried steak special. It was topped with biscuits and gravy and oh so good. We'll definitely be back for one of your famous omelettes! Seriously. There's 24 of them. Do it.

This location happens to always have what we are looking for. There is nothing worse than going on a goose hunt.  We found a kitchen faucet that was on sale and out of stock at the Higley location so we set out to find it at this one. They had one left and price-matched. Our cashier (I'm bad with names) was really great. She was friendly and accommodating and we hope to deal with her again in the future. Keep up the excellent customer service!

I will almost always choose Pizza Hut over the competitors mostly because of the pizza, but this one specifically because of the service I get when I do order. Their promise times are always spot on if not ahead of time!

We bring our 2 boys here to be groomed and always have a pleasant experience.  The employees are friendly and assuring that they will be well taken care of.  At the end of the service, we receive a report card and it's always nice to read the comments they have to say. I would recommend this petsmart groomer to any of my friends or family. Two thumbs up.

A little weary about the low rating considering we had a great first visit.  Our pup had been rubbing his eye raw this season and we took him in to find it was just allergies. Our vet, Dr. Hannigan was great. She was friendly, informative and treated my dog like I want him to be treated. We go back in 2 weeks for a follow up so we will see how that goes.

One of my favorite patios to be on on a warm sunny day. Their food and specials don't hurt either. I love this place.

Goodness gracious.  We just had dinner here for the first time, for our anniversary and it did not disappoint. The filet and lobster tail, as well as the ribeye were, how do I put this?... Perfection. The raspberry cheese cake at the end really sealed the deal. Other than both being beyond stuffed at this point, I would most definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for good eats and excellent service. Ask for Alejandro! He was our server and he was awesome.

Two words. Lauren O!!!  A table of 13. on a Saturday night. and her service was flawless. Most would grunt and sigh over such a large party but she was friendly, attentive and consistently provided quite possibly the best service I've ever received. No glass was left empty, whether it was water or their signature white wine sangria and the food was delicious. We will be back. And we will be requesting Lauren O. Thanks again!

This place has become "that spot" for my partner and I. They have hosted many of our first dates as well as other special occasions over the years. It is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Drink the white sangria. Eat the margarita Pizza. You will not be disappointed.

I wish I was independently wealthy because this place would get a lot of my dollars. I love it here.

I'm giving this 5 stars simply because Zipps is one of my favorite spots in the area. Their service is great, burgers, golden-hot wings and nightly after 8 specials are awesome as well. This is one of those places you start to crave if you haven't been in a while. The only thing I would change about this spot is their patio. It's big, they've expanded, but it's easy to be forgotten/neglected out there. Other than that, when I'm in Gilbert and looking for a good time, we go to Zipps.

I just recently moved to the area but this place is hands down my favorite neighborhood spot. Everyone is friendly, food is good. You can find me here usually once a week. Whether it's happy hour with the buds or date night, it's a good time.

ONE STAR SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO LESSER OPTION. The blonde woman working the counter, unsure if she is the manager or just an associate, is the reason this store/location lost 2 more of it's customers today. Management should seriously evaluate their employees.  I work customer service and am more than forgiving if someone is busy or unavailable but this place is a ghost town in there. The younger guy that ended up helping us was friendly enough, but first impressions were set when we walked in and got the greeting, or lack thereof. Do yourselves a favor and don't waste your time or money here.  As far as upper management goes, do something about this immediately before this woman takes your store down. Terrible service! We won't be back.

My friends and I used to frequent this place every Sunday for Sunday Funday. They have drink specials that cannot be beat. Dusty is 9/10x our guy and he consistently takes great care of us. These days we don't get to make it in as often as we'd like, but when we do, it remains to be a good centralized spot for my friends and I to gather for brunch.

Another one of my favorite spots since moving to the area. I actually have a memory of meeting a friend there for happy hour years ago and really liking it a lot. We recently went for late night happy hour and had a really great time. Whilst having one too many sake bombs, the place had a very good vibe and the bar tender was very attentive to us, not to mention the sushi was delicious. We'll definitely be back, and soon!

The 2 stars are for the 2 great dogs that I have SAVED from this shithole. TODAY, I stopped in because we are in the market for possibly another pup for our dog. I could not believe what I walked into. Stray and rabies quarantined signs on 3/4 of the kennels. Multiple dogs in each kennel. Covered in urine and feces, kennels full of piles of shit. These poor animals deserve better than this. I have never seen it this bad. Flies are everywhere. These animals are miserable. The shelter is currently having a sale on their adoptions until the end of April, yet none of them seem to be available for adoption. I'm not even sure if it's a staffing/volunteer issue, because I saw them walking the aisles, passing the kennels full of shit and other things etc. God, I'm so disgusted over this. These pups need to be saved. ASAP.

A couple girls from work get takeout from Los Favoritos multiple times a week. I was invited in on one of their lunches one Saturday and have been hooked since. Everyone is always very friendly and the food is always delicious. Keep it up!

Oh my freakin goodness. We just tried Thai Patio for the first time and couldn't be more satisfied. We got the orange chicken (as per Yelp! Review recommendations) and I had the Panang Curry, and it was oh so delicious. This will not be the last time you see us, Thai Patio. Planning our next dinner there already! :)

I am seriously in love with this place. The food, the beers, the overall customer service experience. Outstanding, each and every time.   The Arizona smoked wings are killer. A must have. The meat literally falls off of the bone and as an avid wing-goer, these guys are #1 in my book.  The Hub is hands-down, Mesa's best kept secret. Keep doing what you're doing and you have a fan fo' life.

I have found some of my favorite items here. You definitely want to set aside an hour or two because this place is huge. I am easily overwhelmed in antique shops because of all the clutter, but this one is by far one of the most organized. A lot of you fellow Yelpers have mentioned how rude and terrible the front desk lady's are; I personally have never felt that way. Although they are not the friendliest, I at least always get greeted with a hello and a thank you upon exit. So quit being dramatic. It's not cute. (And you're probably a pain in the ass anyway.) Check this place out if you get the chance. Sure, there are some booths I blow right by. (I hate that "antique" but not really antique, I got it at hobby lobby with a 40% off coupon thing some people are trying to pull off.) But you will probably end up leaving with something awesome, fo sho. Enjoy.

Postino postino postino. A top contender for my favorite spot in Gilbert. We came here for Sunday Funday (3/30) An awesome time. Killer Bruschetta. Killer Paninis. And killer wine and beer specials. Sunshine. Great live music! A perfect day. Kayla was our girl and she was awesome. She had excellent recommendations for us. We will most definitely be back because of her.  Do not let her go!

New to the area, dropped by on a Sunday for lunch with friends. Although the pizza, wings and $1.50 coors light drafts were nice, this was the worst service I had in a long time. Waitress was terrible; didn't know her product and we even questioned if she actually worked there. It's safe to say if I ever come back here it will be for take out only.

This place has definitely redeemed itself since my last review. Easily one of my favorite happy hour hang out spots these days. The drink specials are good, the food is delicious and it doesn't hurt having a hangout where they know your name or at least your face!  Keep up the good work!

Outstanding customer service! We stopped in today to check things out, and wound up finding a hutch we were interested in. After spending the last few weeks looking for something to turn into a liquor cabinet/mainly house our beer glasses, wine glasses, etc. We had to swoop it up. The price was just right and not overpriced like most antique furniture in this condition. The kicker, I had my civic and no way to get it home. I put it on hold and later called to ask if they could hold it for me until next Monday. They then, wait for it... Offered to deliver it! Given my home is 30ish minutes away from there, I was blown away by this. Great customer service is hard to find and much appreciated! Safe to say this is a must see for anyone looking for something unique or antique! Thanks again.

We stopped in after having lunch at Postino (next door) for a margarita. We have heard plenty from friends and our waitress and had to check it out. We walked in, ran into a couple friends and joined a table on the patio. We were then greated by the hostess, who "greeted" us with a "so you guys just seat yourself then? I guess I will get you some menus". She then came back warning us that "next time you would be in big trouble for this". Safe to say we abandoned ship and walked out. We returned to Postino and all is well. Welcomed with open arms and a drink prepared. Sidenote: the manager came over to not only apologize for the insensitive hostess but also to offer free tacos for the terrible experience. She deserves the 2 stars. The hostess however, deserves the zero star review. She was rude and being someone that works a 100% costumer service position, she would be let go considering how we were treated. She isn't doing you any favors. Better luck next time.

A friend recommended this spot for a Monday happy hour and this is one of Gilbert's best kept secrets. Sure, the hot spots, blue 32, Harvey's, etc. are the obvious choices. But next time you're faced with packed parking lots and lack of seating, give Isabel's a try. It's delicious and we had a really good time.

Tempe's best kept secret! Stopped in for lunch on a Monday with a few friends. Brian was our server and he was awesome! His attentiveness to detail and friendliness will most definitely keep us coming back for more. Keep it up!

Cool little spot. Went with friends on a Thursday night for some pho and had a wonderful time. I had immediate flashbacks when pulling into the parking lot. Took me back about 10 years to when it was a hookah bar. Time flies. Fast. The food is good; I am new to the pho/ramen thing and am loving every single minute. Delicious. Thursday night is karaoke night. Fun times. Of course there are the few show offs, just like it is at any karaoke night. But who am I to judge them for spending their whole entire week prepping for this? Hog that mic dude singing Whitney Houston, I'm not drunk enough anyway. ;)

This place is a hidden gem for anyone who loves Mexican food and/or just a good neighborhood bar/restaurant vibe. We live within walking distance of Matta's and hope to contribute to their success. A bar tucked away from the city and the "hustle and bustle" requires a lot more love and support. With that being said, the exterior at times could appear to look closed simply because of the position the building faces. The dark blacked out tint sometimes makes me question if they're open for business, but don't let that sway you. It's just a little deceiving at first. We are always greeted by a friendly face and a welcome back. If you live in the area, or are in the area, please check Matta's out. The Taco Trio and Sandy's burrito are to die for. Not to mention their house margaritas are yum. I can honestly say that each and every time is a good time. Whether it is just good eats that leads to good conversation; we are often times walking out with full bellies, (a buzz), and a couple new friends. That's really all you can ask for from a good ol' neighborhood bar. Give these guys a shot. You'll enjoy it. We sure do.
