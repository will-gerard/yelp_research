If you want *real* Eastern NC style barbecue, head to Smithfield or Raleigh or somewhere out that way.  If you can't make it, this place will do.  On the run from Ohio to SC or FL, I stop here nearly everytime.  I lived in Raleigh for a number of years and fell in love with NC BBQ.  Normally you get a tomato based version in western NC, but Bubba's does Eastern pretty close.  Not quite as spicy as "out east" and the Brunswick stew isn't up to my standards, but this place works.

I'd skipped Bubba's for a few years and must say that this latest Friday night on the way to Florida experience was a letdown.  The place was nearly empty, which might be a sign of changes.    The BBQ was cold and dry.  It just wasn't that good.  I'll give Bubba Miller one more chance because he has satisfied my craving for Eastern NC BBQ, but if it goes like this again, we're done.

I was told tonight that every person from Vietnam has a story.  Justina's is all about personalized service, oh, and a rough journey from North Vietnam to Los Angeles, by way of Hong Kong.  Some people may not like her or her style.  I thought she was funny and worked hard to live up to her claim that her food has a secret ingredient, love.  I tasted another ingredient, fun.  I'm not Vietnamese, but I have a story about tonight.  I met a good friend of mine while here on business who had worked with a lady in Tucson who recommended her cousin Justina's restaurant in Phoenix.  When we told our server of this recommendation, the menu was snatched away and we were given "owner's choice".  Not bad.  The Green Papaya salad was excellent, the heat tempered nicely with the Thai Iced Tea.   The shrimp on the side of the salad was also very tasty.  The Pork Short Ribs were next.  They were very tender with a subtle BBQ sauce, slightly sweet and all good.  A beef or pork (not sure) and rice dish came next and it was also very good.  The meat was tender and again, subtly spiced.  Not hot though.  The main dish, a mix of vegetables, scallop, shrimp and beef was less impressive.    Finally, the dessert (not something I usually do) was excellent.  As another reviewer pointed out, they are a little known sensation.  I had the creme brulee (jasmine? not sure, but very, very good) and the mango with sticky rice (covered with coconut milk).  The Vietnamese coffee was also very good.  It is allowed to drip at the table, mixed with the sweetened cream in the bottom of the glass, then poured over ice.  It's strong and full of flavor.  I may be up all night.  Oh, and as for price, this all came in at $58 for both of us.  I don't know if this is reasonable, high or cheap.  It ain't bad in general.  Those of you who do Vietnamese often will have make the call.  I'm not in Phoenix often, but I will return to try some of the other menu items (Pho and other noodles for sure).

Pickles.  That's what I said, pickles.  I've never had chopped dill pickles in my Tabouli salad.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The balance of the salad was the standard bulgar, onion, tomato, parsley and a light dressing.  It was all well balanced and very fresh.  The portion size was just right (a small dinner plate).  It was garnished with thinly sliced tomato and purple olive.  It appeared to have been freshly chopped after I ordered it.  This was a plus.  I also had the Falafel wrap.  It came out in a warm, grilled tortilla.  Contents included a pickle spear (yep, again), lettuce, onion, tomato and a sauce that was like a tahini sauce.  It would have been better with a stronger, more tart sauce, but it was still good.  The Falafel was very good too but they could have put in a few more hunks.  The place is small (only about 8 tables inside).  You go to the counter, place your order and wait.   I sat and they brought the grub out to me.  I'm guessing most everything is made-to-order.    There is outdoor seating.  Prices are great.  Finally, I heard that their Gyro Platter and their Greek Salad are both highly recommended.  I wanted Falafel and I always get Tabouli.  It's worth another try to see if the recommendations are on.

First, except for the golfers and a slightly longer wait, just read Kevin S's review.  I just don't understand this customer service model.  These are tough economic times and when my company's rental deal with Enterprise spits out a slightly cheaper deal than Hertz, I figure I should take the cheaper route.  Who am I to take the more expensive option so that I can be treated to a seamless rental experience?  What kind of blue-blood do I think I am?  This is just becoming the same story over and over and over again.   The saga continues.  When will this dim-witted Ohioan learn?  This time I was stunned at the "dual counter strategy".  Two times to hit you with the up-sell.  The next comical moment came after checking in for a compact car upstairs, I get downstairs and I'm told they have no compact cars ready, but they will be clean in 10 minutes.  I had an appointment in 15 minutes and wasn't sure exactly how to get there, so the answer was "I can't wait 10 MORE minutes, thanks".  To which I was told I could take a minivan for the same price.  What do I look like, a soccer mom?  I took it.  I had to go.  This is like uncool dude hell.  Like Casey C. said, this place has the Seinfeld car rental approach.  You can take the reservation, you just don't know how to HOLD the reservation.    And isn't that the most important part?
