I needed a water valve on a toilet replaced.  I called Armor and they had someone arrive within about 2 1/2 hours.  Bobby, the service guy, was friendly.  The price was reasonable unlike some of the large plumbing companies out there.  We'll use these guys again.

Went on a Friday evening and it was pretty busy but we got right in.  The beer was cold and the min bottle of champagne hit the spot.  We got the crab stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and they were delicious.  We ordered the salmon and steak and crab.  Everything was VERY good.  We'll be back soon.  It was expensive but not like other steak houses.

Pub like environment, very casual.  Good music playing (like Bob Marley) but it was a little too loud during lunch.  I ordered iced tea and it was very good.  It was the fruity kind.  For lunch i got the ceasar salad with salmon.  It was really good.  The dressing on it was OK but the salmon was killer.  Good service.  Good to see a manager on duty making sure all was running smoothly.   It was lunch so I wasn't drinking but I know that all these beers are really good.  I always get the Kiltlifter and the 8th St Ale.

Went here on a Friday at about 5:30pm.  The place was pretty packed so we sat on the patio.  It was nice until the musician started and he was too loud.  We ordered the wings and they were pretty good.  Then we got the chicken skewers that were just OK.  We also got the caesar with salmon and it was good especially the salmon.  It was grilled and was very fresh.  They had a good variety of craft beers on tap and in bottles.  The service was pretty good too.  A good place to show off your street bike.

Went on a Sunday at about 6pm.  No waiting at all as the place was about half full.  Was nice to get a booth.  Decent atmosphere that tries to be rustic but is too new looking to give it a real rustic feel.  We all got the rib eye steak and it was VERY flavorful and cooked right.  I just wish it would have been thicker as it was really thin.  The baked potato was loaded with sour cream, butter and cheese.  The salad was fine but it came in a small plastic bowl which made me feel like I was in a cafeteria.  Plus the croutons were straight out of a box which also reminded me of a cafeteria.  The service was good.  Our waitress was super friendly.  They said unlimited bread but we only got one loaf.  Decent.  4 stars.

If you like to shop from someone that has excellent customer service and buys local, then Clothes Minded is the store for you.  I love the fact that you can choose from such a unique selection of clothes too.  I Love it.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear their clothes or jewelry.   Lorraine Tornga

Neat atmosphere.  They brew their own beer which you can see in the back.  Lot's of TV's to see what's going on in the sports world.  We ordered the pretzel and an appetizer.  It was really good.  I got the fish tacos which were just OK.  i should have known better than to order these from a non mexican food restaurant.  My son got the crunchy macaroni and cheese and liked it.  The wings were good too.  Lot's of tasty beers to choose from.  I got the sampler tray and tried a few of them.   They were all good.

We visited hurricane on a Saturday night. I was very surprised to see that not many people were there. Especially when ASU football was on TV. The service was very very slow.  The bartender filled the draft beer all the way to the rim of the glass and made the beer flat. We were shocked that there was not a manager on duty.  I ordered the fish tacos that were deep fried. It seems as though the  greasr needed to be changed. The fish tacos came with chips as well and only one teeny tiny cup of salsa. I had to ask for more salsa and it still was not enough plus it took about 10 minutes to get it.  We came here just just after the restaurant had opened and it seemed pretty good. However, I don't think I will go back.
