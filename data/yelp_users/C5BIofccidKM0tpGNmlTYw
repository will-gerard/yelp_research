Great place especially when you are drunk.  You can walk right up to it, and order, and for the most part, they get your order somewhat right... if they mess up, it is probably cause you were drunk.

I used to live behind this place, and it is pretty awesome.  Pranksters is great for a neighborhood bar.  The food is good for what you would expect.  Don't come here if you want super fine dining, but if you want to get solid bar food, and a good buzz, this is the place to go.

The most bland food ever.  Delivering was moderate... but to wait that long for super bland food sucks.

If you want an entertaining time, with good beer, and great food and even better service, go to Evo.  I don't know how it is on a weekend before midnight, but as far as a fun place to go on a Monday night with someone you really like, Evo is a very good option.

I shouldn't be giving this a five star because it's not an Irish bar, but Milo and Patrick make it a five star.  The food is on point and love the  pretzels. Free shuffle board for those senior citizens too broke to go on a cruise.  The bar top is nice and soft for when you pass out.  The urinals have tvs, which is good for when you drink the king Kong sized beers.  Great place
