Parking was in the garage. Regularly $10 because of the Suns game but Stand Up Live validated that charge. They get you into the venue/seats really fast. The venue is fairly small which is great because there isn't a bad seat in there. The food actually was pretty good! Better than expected for a comedy club! I think they share the kitchen with Copper Blues next door. Try the carnitas tacos!! The service was pretty slow but I didn't have high expectations with that many people in one room. Also the seating is VERY cramped!! Pretty good drink selection. I don't normally drink liquor too much but I thought the Party Animal was pretty good! Saget was hilarious!!

I've been a member of this gym for about 9 months. For the first month I was very adamant about making sure I was there 3-4 times a week. I soon lost focus and after about two weeks of not going, I received a call from a staff member. He reminded me that I hadn't been in a while. I thought that was a very nice touch to get me motivated to get back in! So after a few months of no-show I finally made my way back in. My first day I decided to go back, I showed up at 5 am, when the gym opened. There was a big group of people waiting to get in. Apparently the staff member in charge of opening that day slept in. Finally we were all let in at 5:25 am. Very discouraging! Overall I am pretty pleased with LA Fitness. Most of the staff members seem to care that my monthly payment helps sign their pay checks. A few others couldn't care less that I'm there. I've never had to wait in line for a machine, but I also typically go at 5 am. Even when I do go at peak hours, it is crowded, but still have never waited in line. The equipment is really nice and functioning. I've only seen one machine inoperable. I've never had any problems leaving my car in the parking lot. I've never been in the locker room, so I have no reviews in that aspect. As long as you're showing up several days a week, I would say it's worth the $30 a month, plus initial down payment.

What initially drew me in was the interior decor. I was in the plaza waiting on a table at a neighboring restaurant so I stopped in to see what this place was. The stylist that had just closed up shop was friendly and told me they offered $15 cuts and $23 monthly unlimited cuts. Sounds awesome.  I decided to stop in today for a cut. The first thing I noticed was that only one other person was there receiving a cut. I sign in and use the restroom. Exiting the restroom I can't help but see into the employee break room and notice two stylists just hanging out.  So I take a seat in a waiting chair and wonder what I'm waiting for at all when there are two people sitting down in the back room. After a few minutes Frances came and asked if I was ready. I couldn't help but ask if she was ready.  Now I'm about to sit in the chair and notice the hair all over the floor from the previous cut. I was reluctant to sit before she cleaned it up. Then I notice the hair all over the seat from the previous cut.   So I asked her to please clean it off. She said "Sorry, its been a busy day." I wondered what she meant by "busy" since, like I said, there was only one other customer in the shop. Today is Mother's Day, keep in mind.   She then countered her own statement by telling me she was just finishing a smoothie in the break room. Wow! Must be swamped! It's my assumption that stylists should clean their station between each cut. I was very disappointed that I had to ask to sit in a clean chair. Pretty much everywhere I looked in the station was covered in hair. Not my hair.  Now time for the cut. She asked how I like it. I tell her, and three minutes later she's done. Very sub-par cut. I've had better cuts at corporate chains. Plain and simple.  It was also awkward when it came time to pay. It felt weird to be asked how much I'd like to tip. I like writing the tip amount on a paper receipt but this is not the case here. Frances seemed offended when I told her I would like to tip $1 and said "excuse me?" as if she hadn't just delivered a Super Cuts standard cut and customer service.  Quite simply, I will not go back. I'm very pleased with my current stylist but Keep It Cut drew me in with their $15 cut and fancy interior decor. The old saying is true, If it ain't broke don't fix it.

Really impressive place!! We stopped in to check it out for a drink, and ended up staying for about three hours. The happy hour prices were very affordable and the choices were abundant! The owner/bartender is a really great guy! Great decor and atmosphere.  You can't really go wrong by checking out a place with this many five star reviews on Yelp. If for nothing else, you at least have to stop in and check out the dancing bartender!
