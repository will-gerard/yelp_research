Holiday lunched catered from this original Red Devil location.   This is a favorite every year for the past 12 years with my employer and it's always consistent and so yummy.   I look forward to next year's dinner,  but try to make the trek across town to enjoy this authentic Italian restaurant.

Friendly staff, excellent spicy chicken, used an entertainment coupon for bogo free meal.  Restaurant could use a deep cleaning as its quite aged. But love their spicy chicken tenders with extra Louisiana hot sauce.

Here for an event put on by Cardons Childrens  Medical Center.  My kids always love coming here and they have great laser tag specials.  Friendly staff, convenient location, but its an old location and could use some updating.

I patronize this family owned restaurant whenever I am in the area.  Have been coming here for many years and it is just as good as the 1st time I ate here.  I always appreciate consistency.  The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is clean.  I'm a creature of habit and like what I like and always order the same thing, teriyaki beef.  They simply have the best teriyaki beef that I have ever tasted.  The quality of meat is excellent and its a bit crispy and oh so wonderful in their teriyaki sauce.  I just wish they were closer to my home.   They have counter ordering and will call you when ready.  Their main dining area seats 15, however they have additional seating and or a banquet room once the main dining is busy.  They also have a few tables outside in which you can view the beautiful bird of paradise flowers.

This location could use an update,  it's pretty run down.  I do appreciate their selection of toys are better than Wal-Mart and target but I do know that they're bigger stores elsewhere.  In the EV this is the best we have.

Filthy!  From garbage in the parking lot to the entrance and excite, this store could benefit from a deep cleaning.   First and foremost if your store isn't clean it will deter customers. During this holiday season this was my second trip to this location. It is hit or miss. Toys selection was quite poor but sometimes they have really great deals and sales. Certainly won't go out of my way to shop here again as it is quite a distance from my house.

Happy Birthday to me.   Arrived at 5pm on a Friday night for a deluxe pedicure for myself for my birthday. Was completely pampered like I had hoped. I was long overdue for a pedicure and the gal (who I cant remember her name, sorry!) was wonderful allowing me to soak my feet before she started my treatment. I went all out getting the deluxe pedicure and it was worth every penny. I will definitely visit again. I stumbled upon this location because of Yelp and I was in the neighborhood.  Thank you Yelp for not letting me down, reviews always speak volumes people!!!

This review isnt specifically for the park, but rather rather Flat Iron.  I had no idea what I got myself into.  I didn't do my research and am an amateur hiker.  Holy crap! !!! I am writing this review the day after the magnificent 7hr hike and am still giving 5 stars.   This hike is breathtaking.  Experiencing all of nature's raw pure beauty was truly spectacular.    This is a difficult hike.  I'm not going to lie.  It took 7 hours start to finish,  burning 6000 calories, climbing  165 stories and over 20k steps, and did over 20k steps per fit bit.  Absolutely beautiful hike in October.

Kids and I drove out of our way from Chandler Mall to get some Thrifty Ice Cream.  We werent there for the water, nor have I ever tasted their stores water. However the two young men behind the counter were a little offended that I have never tasted their water because it is the BEST around, they say.  Customers drive from a distance just to purchase water at this location.   They have a smaller selection of Thrify's flavors, but they had my favorite, Bubble Gum.  The selection of candy is good.  This is a distance from our home, so don't know if we will be back unless we are in the neighborhood. Located in the closed Fry's parking lot strip mall. Would be easy to miss.

This locations price on my iced coffee is 40cents less than my normal location and it's perfect.  They got it right,  YEAH, they chill the coffee before serving over ice.  Thank you! This is the right way to serve.  Friendly service thru the drive thru,  it was fast and convient at 630am.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon about 4pm and this place was crazy busy which is a sign that they do a good job. They have a Dunkin Donuts inside and lots of seating for customers to cool off.  The store is big with a large selection of everything.  The cashiers were super friendly and happy. I chose to sit outside to work on my tan under a palapa umbrella and cozy cushioned seats. I didn't mind waiting a bit since they were so busy. I was comfortable chillaxing outside.  They did a great job cleaning my car and the people watching was fun and the customer eye candy was even better . Will definitely be back again. :)

I was craving chow mein and Yaos reviews were great.  Excellent attentive and friendly staff to all their patrons.   The crab rangoons and sweet and sour sauce was the best I've ever had,  it was so incredibly yummy.    The beef chow mein was good, I probably won't order it again as I didn't care for the meat. The quality of it was poor and tasted funny.  The noodles were great though.    I will definitely be back and will try something different. Prices were so very reasonable.

Excellent food and service.  The cheese crisp is awesome. A simple cheese crisp but made on a tortilla that stays crispy.  The chimis are stuffed with so much meat.  Great little MeXican restaurant.  My daughter loves the sink in the girls restroom..a tin bucket.

Open Sundays,  even though it says closed.  This is definitely a hole in the wall bar in the back of a strip mall but my dad swears they have the best burgers.   Very small,  very dark interior,  but friendly staff and excellent food and cheap beer.   I love a good bar especially the food. And dad was loving his burger. We will be back.  They have specials daily.  Nothing fancy,  just good food!

Family owned and operated and I won't go anywhere else for tires from now on.   They are fast, efficient,  friendly,  and affordable.  Their location is a bit of a drive for me,  however the money I saved doing business with them paid for itself.   Excellent recommendation by a friend and I'm so glad I patronized EV Tire and will suggestion to all that I know!

Okay pizza,  not crazy about the sauce on the pizza. Gal at the register was not very helpful while trying to place our order.  When we sat down I witnessed her itching her nose quite intensely and never saw her wash her hands.  Ewwww!!  The service was poor, although they had lots of staff in the kitchen, when our wings arrived,  the young man didn't ask I'd we needed anything and when our pizza arrived, they didn't even serve the first place.  Very disappointing.  Tables were dirty and the tray host to hold our pizza next to the table was filthy.  This location could use some deep cleaning work all the staff behind the counter.  Not sure I'll dine here again.

1st time ordering delivery from Rush Street. Family owned and operated which I absolutely love and want to patronize, however the pizza was just ok. We ordered delivery and felt that Barros Pizza is much better.  The flavor was kind of bland, the sauce had a hint of sweetness, and the dough was tough and rubbery tasting.  I know they have been around quite a few years and hope they continue many more for all that enjoy their food.  Probable wont be back.

Was here a couple weeks ago with the kids and had a great meal and experience.  So good that as I was running errands today,  I was hungry for it.    So disappointed today.  I order what I normally do, the orange peel chicken and for $8.69 I got a huge scoop of rice that towered over the 10 or so little chicken nuggets looking pieces and it was so dry tasting. I asked the server if I had a side portion and he so no. He could see the disappointed look on my face and agreed to bring me more.  I appreciated that.  But even with that,  I thought for a lunch portion it was quite expensive.    Booo

I have a love hate feeling for Forever 21!!!!  I'll start with positive 1st, love that the clothes are affordable for my 14yo daughter,  this makes me happy.  The store has so much to choose from.    Now the hate,  this store is filthy!!! Disgusting, the dust balls,  the floors,  I get chills everytime my daughter wants to shop there.  The clothing racks ate so stuffed is impossible to look for a correct size.  And if you find something that you love but don't babe the correct size,  good luck finding the rack it belongs on,  because the staff most times can't figure it out either.    Have purchased jewelry here,  NEVER do that again.  It was defective add the clasp was broken and unusable. cheap junk jewelry.   All in all,  like the affordability,  but despise this particular location. Add the store at Chandler Mall is twice as big,  super friendly and very clean.

1st time riding the light rail.  Surprised my kids and we took the light rail downtown to a Diamondbacks game, compliments of Camp Soaring Eagle. Arrived in the park and ride lot and a nice worker helped us purchase our tickets and we boarded the rail.  Come to find out he was the driver, he was so friendly to everyone.  He really enjoys his job, as we traveled from Mesa, I watched him wave to oncoming buses and patrons standing at the stops.It was a full ride as so many were headed downtown.  Only irritating part is the people that scan your tickets, don't stay on the entire ride and we had to have our tickets scanned 3 times by 3 different people.  Our ride back was a little more interested. It was Saturday night at 11pm, what was I expecting! I told my kids to stay together and hang onto their belongings as it was a little scary riding back with some free entertainment.  The young man with the really loud boom box playing rap music, which I didn't mind, it was enjoyable, but as he exited a drunk man entered and he had many people laughing as he was way over intoxicated and singing and swearing, it was wild! It was manly males on the ride back, some sleeping, mostly alone.  But overall a great affordable experience to travel across the city.

First time customer. Very attentive service from the moment I walked in the door.  Excellent happy hour beer specials. However they don't have it posted anywhere.  Ordered the sampler appetizer and the wings were really good along with the mozzarella sticks and zucchini. This bar is tucked away in a strip mall, but you can tell they have lots of regulars.  I will be back.

In search of a Nike hooded sweatshirt so I thought I would stop in at this location.  Friendly staff, however I think they out numbered the amount of actual customers in the store.  If I didn't know better, I would think this location is about to close.  It was very dirty, unkept, and the selection is very poor. I didn't find what I was looking for, however I did purchase a pair of Nike tennis shoes that were clearance.  Next time I think I'll shop Dicks for better selection, yet their customer service is horrible!!

If I could giver zero stars I would. Our visit was a complete disaster!!!  Went thru the drive thru for what I thought was a simple order.  Order 3 drinks, a kids corn dog meal with tater tots and mozzarella sticks. Was nicely greeted by a young man at the window who repeated our order correctly.  Paid and thought we were on our way. NOT! No straws, so I park the car, walk to the restaurant to retrieve, get back to the car and my daughter shows me that the mozzarella sticks are old and not even hot, the cheese is rock hard.  Proceeded to go back thru the drive thru to order an additional item for my girl and she takes out her corn dog and its cold and ROCK hard, like it had been sitting there for a week. GROSS! Get to the window with the nice young man and explain and show him what our order looked like and the girl at the cash register rudely slammed the window as he turned his back to talk to someone.  I was embarrassed to bring all these errors to their attention, however this is unacceptable!! I request to speak with a manager, who comes to the window, he apologizes and says he'll get my new food. I pulled up as the drive thru was crazy busy and trying to be polite. Manager comes to car and again apologizes and asked what happened?  I wish I would have taken photos of the items we received, it was a joke and disgusting! Will drive way out of my way to go to another Sonic, this place STINKS!!!!

Drive through was busy Wednesday evening at 9/23/15 at 715pm and as we drove up to collect our food from the 2nd drive through window, we were "thrown our meal" in its bag.  Luckily I caught it, but dang, why you need to be so rude?  Once we drove off and we saw that the fries didn't even fill the cup, I know now why they threw the bag  to get rid out us.  We love Wendy's fries and were sadly disappointed last night! :(

This is the only location that I go to because the customer service is always top notch and  THIS IS A REAL TMOBILE store.   Today Brian,  store manager, helped me and was patient and helped me resolve my problem with my phone.   This location is always busy,  and parking is sometimes difficult,  but these guys are great. And it's reassuring to see the same consistent staff too.

I'm A HUGE Red Robin Fan! !!!  And recently I've been quite disappointed with them.  We've patronized a couple different locations and continue to be disappointed with food and terrible service.   However this visit was different.  We were greeted by Alex our server and he made our dining experience the best!  I dined with my 2 kids and I'm a service snob, I admit it!  I've worked in the industry and have high expectations. Knowing that servers make so minimal they should be on there best game to earn your tip. if I received phenomenal service regardless of how much my bill is I will tip very generously.

New location!  Located on northwest corner of Guadalupe and Higley in the Tia Rosa strip mall.  Was previously located near baseline.   I have used this urgent care in the past as I prefer a pediatric urgent care for my kids.  We were in and out within a little over an hour. The back office assistant was very friendly, kind, and very geniune. The gentleman greeting us at the front desk was less than enthusiastic about being there,  but got the job done.  I didn't think it was appropriate that his electronic cigarette was sitting on the desk.   The physician was appropriate and nice,  not like our pediatrician,  but we got what we needed.

Memorial Day dinner and didn't feel like cooking. Mom and I headed to nearby Serrano's for dinner.  Was greeted by friendly staff, server was punctual and made suggestions for us at our request.   The bus boys/chips and salsa young man was very attentive with chips and salsa.  I noticed they were very thorough cleaning tables after many kids left, underneath the tables were so full of food and they cleaned it spic and span :) I appreciate cleanliness and excellent customer service. Mom and I both ordered Chimis and the meat was spicy and very flavorful.  Happy Hour in the Cantina Monday thru Friday 3-6.

Love our neighborhood Basha's store.  In the last few months they completely remodeled and I love the warm feel of the store. The staff is always friendly and their bakery is the best. I prefer their baked good and donuts to Fry's. Although, the parking lot Bosa Donuts just moved in, I still prefer Bashas over their donuts as well. I feel its so important to shop local and the Basha family does so much for our community that we should shop them. Recently walked the JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes) walk at Sloan Park and Basha's is a major sponsor providing breakfast of yogurt, fruit, water with the JDRF logo.  They also provided bags with groceries that included loaves of bread, canned food, granola bars, health food.  They are truly amazing and I appreciate all they do!!!

They truly have the best interest of the customer.  Have referred several friends here. Located at McQueen and Warner and offer Saturday appointments which is convenient for us M-F working folk.  Don't ever waste your money at H&R block people, these are the go to guys!!!!

No one ever wants to pay a visit to the closest ED, however my adorable boyfriend was trying to fix a broken washer and and sliced open his thumb on the sheet metal and required stitches. We were greeted by the registration and nurse to triage him at the entrance window and they were friendly, professional and traiged him quickly to a triage room to asses "the damage" as he was covered in blood and was white as a ghost in color.  He is a big boy at 6'3'' and I think the nurse didn't want to pick him up off the floor if he fainted.  We were in and out of the ED with stitches in 3 hours.  This is impressive in my book, considering I work for a local competitive health care organization.  All of the staff that we encountered on this full moon Monday night, were so friendly, kind, compassionate, and professional with my boyfriend and I. Their slogan of "hello human kindness" was true for our visit.  I had to deduct 1 star due to cleanliness.  I know ED are so extremely busy, however the floors and the gurney were disgusting and could use a good rotational cleaning.

Barros is always amazing!  They are consistent and have awesome pizza. Tonight is no exception!

Would like to see that the handicap parking revised. Currently you have to walk the entire length of the restaurant to the park your car. It's quite far.   Service was extremely slow,  granted it was a bit busy,  but there was lots of staff walking by.  Salsa was okay and the chips were okay,  nothing great.  Something to eat while passing the long wait for our lunch.   I ordered a cheese crisp with shredded beef,  it was disgusting the way it was presented.  The meat was so wet that the crisp was no longer crispy.  It was very unappetizing.  Blah! We couldn't get our bill fast enough to get out of there. .. definitely won't return.  There is way better Mexican around town.

The same general manager Mike Massine has managed this location for many years and it shows.   Always expect a great meal with great service and this visit was no different.  Excellent and consistent!   Prices have increased,  but what hasn't these days. Serve top quality meat.    Sign up for the email club and they will send you free offers!!!! I LOVE FREE!!!

Located in a strip mall, nothing fancy. Very outdated decor.  Rude staff with extremely  inefficient service.  Food was good when we finally received it.  Our food didn't come out together and our party had to wait for one another to finish eating.  Soup came after our entrees were delivered to the table.  Definitely do not recommend as female waitress was "hitting on" the female guest at my table.  Very inappropriate.

Craving a breakfast burrito and we decided we wanted Filibertos for breakfast.  Ordered in the drive thru and the young man's language barrier was so bad that we had to pull up to the window to communicate.    He repeated our drink order five times. ..not one or twice,  but FIVE times and it was still wrong when we got home.  He didn't understand what root beer was and asked if it was blueberry?  REALLY? We ordered Mt Dew and learned that we got lemonade once we were home.    Ugh, so frustrating.  I understand is Mexican food,  but at least put someone that can communicate in tyne drive thru window.  Because I'm pissed and im sure he's frustrated or maybe he doesn't give a shit. But you'd think that management would care when their food costs are increased because they have to correct do many mistakes by remaking the food.    On a positive note,  the inside of the restaurant was very clean when I had to go back in for the wrong item to be corrected.

Went thru the drive thru at dinnertime.  Was fast and efficient.  Dallas assisted me by making a suggestion when I asked a question on which "Go Cup" I should order. I went with his suggestion and went with the 2 chicken strips and wedges. Excellent value for $2.99 . Will definitely be back.

Enjoy this location with a drive thru and they give local discount with my badge from my employer, since they are nearby.  I appreciate that they appreciate us, it speaks volume of the owners.  Our DQ near our home doesn't have a fryer and my kids love the french fries and cheese curds here....I know funny, but its worth our drive.  They are always fast and friendly as we usually use the drive thru as we are always on the go. Writing this review is making me hungry for a Snickers blizzard. :)

Don't know what's going on with Red Robin, but I don't like it.  Sunday afternoon at 2pm its gorgeous out and we want to sit outside and see that the patio is empty. We ask at the hostess stand if it's open seating like normal and are told no, only open seating is at the bar itself, but there is a 25min wait...REALLY? There's 2 tables with guests on the patio and a high top in the bar but we have to wait....irritated and hungry!  So boyfriend and I sit at the bar with immediate seating,  that's fine at least it's quick.  But if I'm a server and you're not seating my area,  I'm not making money.  So I order what I normally do and order garlic fries, which is an up charge only to receive different than before.  Bartender shares that they changed to a dry rub" a month ago instead of the fresh garlic.  THEY SUCKED! !!! So disappointed and still had to pay for them.  Aside from that service was good at the bar,  but Red Robin isn't the same.  The management is different than it used to be,  there are no regular servers anymore and the food was. .. just okay.   Used to eat here multiple times a month but time to find a new hangout.

Ordered grilled chicken and it was so rubbery that I had to send it back,  it was so disgusting. When a sandwich costs $10 I expect more.  Service was good with Laaina. We chose to sit outside so we didn't have to wait 30 minutes when half the restaurant was empty.   Red Robin,  I don't know what's going, but the last year things have went down hill. This used to be our favorite family restaurant dining multiple times a month and now we seldom visit.

I'm giving them 5 stars.  They provide  free  WiFi and a friendly customer service gal to help first times like myself.  The one and only worker was busy helping customers and cleaning machines.  Clean location with vending machines and video games.  Haven't been to a Laundry mat in too many years.  Very large location,  didn't have to wait for a machine.

I love this park! Its near my house, never very busy and a nice and tranquil park.  The park offers many things to do for the entire family. I went Sunday night to walk/run and was surprised by the amount of cars in the parking lot and people on the trails.  Come to find out that people were there to see the blood moon. It was pretty spectacular. Love to see the bunnies and the pretty flowers next to the lake with people fishing and the small waterfall. Perfect location for photos with your family, watch the sunset or sunrise.  Love this hidden gem!!

Even though there is a brand new DD near my house, I drive out of my way to come to this location.    When I come in the mornings Desiree is usually working the drive thru window,  she is pleasant and always smiling.  I always order the same iced mocha latte and it's consistent and good.

July 2015, store is currently under construction,  it's a little chaotic, however employees very friendly.    I'm very excited to see one the remodel is complete.  Looks more spacious and I think it will have a huge salad bar and the sushi bar will be up front in the store.    This is a very busy location with the population growing in STV.

Brought in some items to sell and was fortunate enough to meet with the owner.  He was very thorough and explained how he tested the items and exactly what he was doing.  He tested the items right in front of me and even shared his eye glass to show me what he saw to teach me.  Excellent experience,  very honest.  They buy all kinds of jewelry,  not just gold.  Highly recommended to anyone. Received check on the spot.  Thank you! !!!!

Waited to review until my mom was completely discharged about our experience.  This is moms second admission here and this was our first choice for rehab facility from Banner Desert.  My mom was here 6 years ago and had a great experience.  My moms stay was 15 days for rehab and she did so well and exceeded the therapists goals at her age.  My mom had a couple favorite RN, but especially Jillian.  She was extra special to my mother.    When you think of hospitals or "facilities" you think that the food wont be good, however my mom being the most amazing cook and very picky about quality enjoyed all of her meals in the dining room.  The kitchen staff was so friendly and you could see that they enjoyed their jobs and they put passion into their meals.  It didn't go unnoticed.  The facility is especially clean, as clean as it was 6 years ago.   Dr Ramaswamee (sp) was my moms hospitalist physician and he was personable, kind, and reminded us of a gentle giant.  The staff couldn't say enough wonderful things about him as a physician and person.  My overall impression was fantastic.  Having mom away from home was difficult but to be treated with respect, dignity, kindness, and love, we are forever grateful that she is almost back to herself, at the sweet age of 83.  Thank you Healthsouth for all of your staff for making a difference and lasting impression on our family.  i will recommend to all that are seeking a rehab facility.  P.S. The kitchen provides 24hrs complimentary soda, juice, and coffee to all staff and families. Thats more than my healthcare employer does.

Purchasing a car is such a long drawn out process that most people absolutely dread!!! I was in the market for a new used car for myself and as a single woman, i was afraid that I wouldn't be given a good deal. I was greeted by Marc Delaney on a week night evening and my car buying experience was the best that I have ever experienced.  He was delightful, patient, and worked hard for me to get into the car I wanted.  I came with pre-approved financing and I didn't have to haggle my trade in.  He was very fair!   I think I was in and out of the dealership that night with my new used car that I absolutely love! Im the new owner of a Hyundai Sonata :)  Thank you Marc, you are a true asset to San Tan Hyundai and I will recommend friends to you!

Absolutely HATE this store.  They have NO customer service.    My visit today was to exchange an item that my daughter received. The lines were long at the register so I approached a young lady in the Nike area to ask her the exchange policy,  however she was so busy texting on her phone while looking like she was folding clothes and offered no assistance to help me.    I'm furious as I'm wiring this and REFUSE to ever personally shop here and will go out of my way to shop somewhere that appreciates my business.   I made 3 trips to the customer service register with no success and left with my product with no exchange.  When I shared my feelings about the lack of customer service to the Softline Mgr, he offered me a card to call Corporate.  WHAT? How about providing me some service right now,  right here. ...it starts with the people in the store,  not corporate,  especially since you carry the manager title.    This location has never offered any customer service,  not because they lack staff as the mgr used as his excuse, they will only help you if you approach and all for help.    No apology, no how can I help, NOTHING!!!!!

Its Halloween time and this was my first idea of where to shop when I needed glow in the dark items.  They didn't disappoint!!! I arrived 25 minutes before they closed and the parking lot was completely empty as the store was too; however once walking through several aisles I was surprised at all the staff that were working.  They were so busy unpacking all the Halloween merchandise and working hard. Didn't receive much assistance, but I was okay with that as I knew what I was looking for. Party City has changed a lot over the years and I was pleasantly surprised.  Will definitely be back to shop again.

Grabbing a quick bite and was near this location.  Haven't been to an Einstein in a long time.  I thought, perfect they have a drive thru too.   Ordered a toasted cinnamon raisen bagel with cream cheese and was told $2.96. I thought I heard the cashier wrong,  when I got to the Window I confirmed the price. $1.50 for a tablespoon of cream cheese??? ..RIDICULOUS! !!!  I remember the the days when they put too much on and I needed to take some off.  At least give me my monies worth. This is my last trip to Einsteins. For $3 I'd rather spend my hard earned money elsewhere.

Came on Thursday and enjoyed a great special.  $10 for 2 hours of jumping.  For am extra $3 kids can enjoy a few extra courses.    It's been awhile since the kids and I've been here and glad to see they've added new attractions.  However,  mechanical bull want working tonight.  Nice to see plenty of staff at each area to watch out for miss behaviors or rowdy kids.    They provide free wifi, which is a plus for parents just hanging out.  They have several tables to sit at with leather chairs to kick back in,  but as you can see below,  chairs need new fabric desperately.   They sell water bottles,  Gatorade,  chips,  candy and soda.  They do not allow you to bring your own water bottles in.  I guess it's a good way to make more revenue.    All in all,  great value for the fun the kids enjoyed tonight.  Perfect place to hang it during the summer when you're looking for something cool to do inside.

My 1st time here at my daughters request. Ordered breakfast burrito with chorizo and potatoes and it was so yummy.  Their red hot sauce is amazing.  We dined in and the restaurant is clean and very well maintained.  Definitely will be back as the gal at the register was super nice and helpful with my 1st visit.  Many regulars as she was talking to most patrons.

Thought we'd try something different tonight as we're celebrating my boyfriends birthday week.  We have both been to Famous Dave's before just never together.   We arrived about 715pm and we always sit at the bar,  especially during football season.  The bar had 2 guests souring at it and the remainder of the bar was dirty. Not one open seat inviting us in.  As we stood there,  i finally spoke up and asked the bartender if we can sit there, and he finally started cleaning up.   I thought ok,  let's give this guy a chance,  he probable just finished a rush and hadn't pickled up yet.   Ummm no!!!! The service continued to decline and the mess just piled up.  Boyfriend and I finished first beer and waiting 10 or 15 minutes before I asked across the beer for 2 more beers. REALLY?  this is crappy service.   Not only did the bartender wait on the bar guests,  he was responsible for all the tables in tyne bat and the outside patio.  While he was outside I could have served myself quicker.  Not very smartly thought out.  Service was crappy,  food was cold,  dirty restaurant.  Very disappointed in this location.  Even saw manager running food out,  but never stopped to greet tables or round  on guests.  Obviously this location is lacking from management down.  Chandler mall and mesa riverview will get my business next time.  UPDATE 11/3 Impressed that the General Manager attempted to call me to speak with me regarding my experience, however after each of us leaving a message for one another, it didnt go any further than that. The ball was left in his court and he never attempted again. Guess he REALLY didnt want to talk to me. Too bad!!

Absolutely LOVE this place and my kids ask to be taken there, of course they have CANDY!!!!  The staff is always so very friendly and helpful and its extremely clean.  They even provide shopping carts if you cant carry all our your goodies.  Its a perfect place to shop for any holidays or event as you can chose from bulk to individual items.  If you are throwing a baby shower, themed birthday, wedding or any event, there is something that can color coordinate your party. I love to fill my kids Easter baskets from here too as they have unique  and fun items.  They are conveniently located on the northwest corner of Alma School and Chandler Blvd.

Haven't eaten here since they moved their location from Main Ave in Mesa location.  No one at the front to greet us when we arrived and when the gentleman seated us,  he lacked a personality.  Should have left at that point.  We ordered chimis and the amount of food was great,  it was hot and exactly as we ordered.  However being the picky eater I am I asked for no condiments,  However instead I'd like cheese with my chimi.  When the bill came we were charged $2 more for cheese. Or waitress coyly answer why it was more.  Very poor. ...I would have appreciated the heads up for the extra change.  There are plenty of other restaurants to patronize.  I won't be back.

Came here to hear my daughters friends band play on a Saturday afternoon. Had no idea what to expect and I was pleasantly impressed.  The atmosphere is extremely casual with sofas, tables and chairs, and high top tables. Service was excellent as the cashier assisted us with our drink selection. Loved that they are local and support open mic and local bands, such a cool concept.  I will definitely come back just to hang out as it was very CHILL!!

Dannys is in the process of changing their name to Jackson's. Came for a wash and mentioned that my AC had a bad smell.   Matt, the service writer, helped me and suggested to "bomb" the inside of my car.   He was very professional and not pushy what so ever.   Had a great experience, car looks and smells awesome! Will definitely come back if Matt is there.

Always a great experience for my little Chihuahua.  With my hectic schedule its difficult to make an appointment, however we usually visit on Saturdays without an appointment and I've never been turned away.  It make take several hours, however I am OK with that.    She always comes out with an adorable little bandanna.  Nail trims, ears cleaning, baths and teeth cleaning are the services that we have sought and we have never been disappointed.  Staff is friendly and very helpful and they are always busy...this is a good sign!

The best cheese steak around.  The portion sizes are ginormous,  could easily share a sandwich.  The bun is soft and the meat is so tender.  We also ordered chicken wings and the have to be the largest wing size around.  If you're craving a hearty steak sandwich this is the to check out. We had no idea they serVed thrifty ice cream too.  We may come back just for ice cream.  Very pleased with this Mike's cheese steak.  Only suggestion is to see them clean their rest rooms and add a mirror in the ladies room.

Love this concept and this location.  Staff are always friendly and its very clean.  I don't mind taking my pizza home to bake when its not soo hot out. Their thin crust is amazing as I love the crispy cracker type crust. They even offer a punch card system to encourage your return visits.

Attempted to go through the drive thru twice today to use the ATM. No power to it on both visits. So inconvenient, there aren't enough branches around in the east valley. Now driving to another location to deposit checks. Not a happy camper.

It's crazy to revisit a place that I worked at 20 years ago.  The best part was the Texas toast,  it's the same exact recipe they had when I worked here.  But make sure you ask for it because it doesn't automatically come work your meal.  Salad bar was good and clean today on father's day with 3 soups,  potato skins,  shredded pork,  ground beef,  ice cream machine, fruits, pudding and much more. The salad bar is a great value.   Steak and seafood prices are quite pricey, but for 2 senior meals and and a salad bar with drinks included we ate for under $30.  My dad enjoyed his lunch so we will be back.

This morning I give one star. I find it unacceptable to be waiting in the drive thru line with nobody else there at 6:03 in the morning having to wait 3 minutes for my order to be taken. That's unacceptable. Usually I am in an out of the drive thru very quickly however this just irritated me this morning when I'm in a hurry to get to work.

This location is ridiculous!!!! The only reason they stay in business is because of their name and location. There is nothing else out here. The food is always inconsistent the staff is constantly changing which doesn't help.  This morning at 6:40am there is only one employee working the drive thru and inside customers,  that's crazy. They are lucky he doesn't just walk out. Waiting in the drive thru for 15 or 20 minutes for a coffee is absolutely ridiculous and just reminds me why I shouldnt patronize this location. Look out McDonalds once Dunkin Donuts open your morning rush will be no longer. Unless you step up your game and offer exceptional customer service. #alwaysdisappointed

Sad but true that I am the duchess of this location and it's McDs,  but in my neighborhood there aren't many choices.  My kid and I like their breakfast,  drinks, and ice cream (healthier Mcd options)  It doesn't matter what time of day I come to this location, they are soooooo SsssLLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWWWW! Especially the morning times.  I'm wtiting this review while waiting on 2 hash browns, and I ordered 10minutes ago and am still the 3rd car in.  They never have enough help and move so slow, 14 min total in the drive thru is ridiculous.   But I keep coming back and so does the rest neighborhood because they are so busy.

Love this neighborhood market that it has Walmart prices without entering the big store.  Its easy to get in and out.  Staff is always friendly store appears maintained and clean.  I much prefer the Neighborhood Market than the regular Walmart store and now they offer curb side pick up.  How awesome is that!!!

We attended a JDRF event at Sloan Park in Mesa and Raising Canes was a sponsor and had a tent at the event.  My daughter and I have wanted to try this new restaurant.   We met Christopher at the event and he was so friendly and offered us a meal to come in and try their food.  So we did, we arrived after lunch and they were so busy, we talked to the manager Mel and she took care of our meal, just as offered. Thank you to all the friendly staff and the excellent food. But especially for sponsoring the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation walk on Saturday in Mesa.  We will definitely be back as our meals were great and your support means even more!

First time here but after seeing fellow  yelpers check in,  thought we'd give it a chance.  Boyfriend lives nearby so it's very convenient.   Sat at the bar,  my favorite spot,  and was greeted by a male and female bartender.   Made it in time for happy hour specials on a Saturday night.  Had beer and looked at a menu.  Great food selection.  We chose to drink first.  Bartenders introduced themselves and welcomed us and told us about their specials.  Made us feel very welcomed.  Offered a sample of moonshine since I've never tried before... Apple pie was phenomenal!! Drank a moonshine specialty drink and it was so good.  After several drinks we ordered their signature garlic fries, they were awesome.   All in all I think we've found our new neighborhood bar to hang out at.  Been to Zipps and Native,  but the customer service and attention was awesome here.  Nothing better than sitting at the bar with a cold beer sports and my boyfriend.   Thanks for a great experience and as we left we learned that the male bartender was the owner.   Support local businesses!!!!!!

Woman of Excellence Healthcare is a local OB/GYN office located in San Tan Valley off of Hunt Hwy.  Founded by Dr Butler-Poku who is amazing and patient provider who goes above and beyond with all of her patients. The entire staff is very kind and knowledgeable. Love that Sonora Quest is set up in the office to have all my labs drawn, very convenient without having to wait. Thank you for providing services to the San Tan Valley area.

High Tide never disappoints!   From the beautiful ambiance,  amazing and friendly staff,  beautiful silverware,  and exceptional food,  you can't go wrong.   Cocktails are awesome and the best bread pudding I've ever had in my life,  it was so so good.   Owners are present and attentive as well as all the staff,  the entire staff works together as a great team.   Food, plating, and taste is always consistent. Service is top notch and to arrive at 5pm on a Saturday and the restaurant is full,  really means something.   Just left,  and can't wait to come back again.

Slow service once we arrived and got to our table,  thought it was going to be a experience.   Our server, Kenny, was ok, but wasn't able to meet our specific dietary needs.  I was frustrated!  Brian,  the manager,  came to the rescue,  and made our experience right!  He really took care of us and turned our experience around.

Brand new car wash,  conveniently located on the southwest corner of Ocotillo and Ellsworth.   Just purchased a basic wash for $6, but they offer multiple washes and even monthly wash passes where you wave your "fob" and slide right thru the line.   Wash first and then head over to dry the vehicle with high pressure air and super sucker vacuums. I love it!  They even have vending machines selling products you may need.   I saw staff on hand in case there is a problem.  Very busy but they have three rows to park and work on your vehicle.    No duelies!  Will definitely be back,  clean,  convenient,  and great priced!

Conveniently located on the southeast corner of Power and Baseline in their new location.   Received excellent service by a gentleman named Matt today. As a woman I'm always afraid I'm going to be ripped off for services that I don't really need.   I felt at ease with him and he gave me an honest quote for my car and advised me what truly needed to be done and what I could wait on.  I'll definitely be back as this is my new place to have my vehicle serviced for mechanics and tires.    Thank you Big O!!

Stopped by Saturday morning while they were very busy and asked in the bays if they could just check my moms tire as I thought it was kind of low.  A nice gentleman who I believe is the manager, Michael?, was happy to help me and took the time to check, fill, and make a recommendation on the tire that needed air.  This isn't a tire shop and they were very busy, but he acted like I was the only customer that was there and I really appreciate the time he took.  It cost me nothing, he made no money off of me, but I wont hesitate to do business there in the near future. Thank you Brakes Plus and welcome to our neighborhood.

Who would have thought you could have a store in soda alone?  This is a creative soda shop where they serve Coke products with a twist,  and they are so so yummy!  This hidden location at the very west part of the Fat Cats strip mall could be easily missed, however I knew it was there somewhere in the dark parking lot.   My kids were dying to try as their friends have all posted about it. We were greeted by a friendly young man at the counter who was eager to help us in our selection.  He was genuinely happy to be working there. ..I love that!   Each soda is differently priced even if they are the same size, I think it depends on how many ingredients it includes. The 3 of us all ordered something different and 2 chocolate chip cookies costing $10. That's reasonable!   They have a drive thru which constantly had at least 4 cars in it and the line sometimes was out the door.  There is a bar to sit up at and watch them make drinks and socialize with staff.  The young kids loved that as each seat was taken.  There are 2 sofas and many tables and thru provide outlets for your electronics......yeah!!

1st visit to this new location in Queen Creek. We attended my daughters High School Cheer fundraiser and had an excellent experience.  Our service was great by Haylee at a high top table and the manager, Ben, made his rounds thanking us for dining with them that evening. We arrived in time for Happy Hour prices that I believe go till 7pm. Very clean and friendly staff. Thank you BWW for supporting the community and Casteel High School Cheer.  We will definitely be back.

1st time here Monday night. Arrived at 530p to meet a girlfriend for Happy Hour and was pleased that it was served to the entire restaurant, not just the bar area. I ordered a draft beer and she ordered a Cosmo Martini, we both enjoyed our drinks and we ordered off the HH menu that is served till 7pm.  We ordered the bruscetta and buffalo shrimp.  Both were excellent.  Our server was Colton, he was very attentive and helpful in recommendations.  Since we probable overstayed our time limit till 8pm, he never continued to provide excellent service even though he probably would have like to turn the table to another family. Will definitely be back and don't know why it has taken me so long to try this neighborhood restaurant.  We don't have many options in this area. I'm craving the buffalo shrimp, it was so delicious, and the HH prices were very reasonable.

Brand new Goodwill building with convenient drive thru for donations. Thought I'd check it out inside since I saw the first day they broke ground and I have to say,  it smells like a traditional Goodwill.   I almost choked on the strong cinnamon smell.  Yuck! But very clean and friendly staff.

Newly opened drive thru car wash next to QT on Val Vista.  Best deal is to purchase the monthly pass.  Wash is pretty thorough and LOVE that the vacuums are on each side of the vehicle for convenience. If your vehicle is highly saturated with bugs,  I suggest doing the pre scrub.  Great deal,  clean,  and convenient.

Love the same day appointment idea.  Called this morning and was able to get in this evening with Dr Chang. Staff was very efficient and friendly.  This was my first time seeing Dr Chang and he was great.  I normally see Dr Herrera,  both providers are excellent.  Made me feel at ease and comfortable.

Was so excited to try this new restaurant at San Tan Mall area on Saturday afternoon.  Its convenient and a great place to meet with friends on the patio or in the beautiful bar.  I was so sadly disappointed from the beginning of the check in process.  Thinking that maybe they didn't have it all together, I figured it would get better.  They are brand new and should be on top of their game with excellent food and service, right?  There were so much staff when we put our name in, it was a little overwhelming, don't they have silverware to roll or something? The gal in the white batman dress who took our name on the wait list was a little spacey. She attempted to take our name multiple times all the while we sat and waited for our table. No smile, no personality.  We should have left at that point.  Our party consisted of 4 and none of us had been there before.  Our waitress also lacked personality and we could barely hear her. Its a loud restaurant/bar.  She made no recommendations when we stated this was our first time dining there.  I ordered a chicken ceasar salad.  It was good, nothing extra special.  It was quite small, so I thought it would be the side salad price of $5.95, however when I received the bill it was $12.95, holy moly!!!! That's ridiculously priced!!!!  My friend has a pear bruscetta and she enjoyed it.  My daughter was interested in dessert, in which we had to ask for a menu.  She ordered a hot fudge sundae.  It was $6.95 for 2 scoops of ice cream and hot fudge.  There was more whipped cream on the sundae than ice cream.  So disappointed, definitely will not be back.  I much rather head over to Kona Grill or Gordon Biersch with excellent service and signature food.  Nothing special here as service was poor and unfriendly, food was over priced and nothing special.
