This place is the bomb!! Best dive bar ever!!! Low-key, out of the way-ish, great service & awesome burgers!!! Great place to grab a quick bite during the lunch hour and/or a beer or three.  Come for the burgers, stay for the sports, pool, wings, PBR & darts!! I've only been twice in 2 weeks but will be a regular from now on!

My daughters and I have been patients since 2002 and always appreciate the care & courtesy we ALWAYS receive. Dr Burson is awesome ~ she takes the time to explain things on what she is seeing and asks about how my girls are doing if they aren't with me!

Great food & fun atmosphere! It is one of those low-key place you look for when trying to find something unique. I have had fun everytime I've been there. Plus its a great place to learn a little about the history of Litchfield Park and how far it has come. Its a perfect dinner venue on the 4th of July for the fireworks displays from Goodyear & Litchfield Park. mmmmm, ready for lunch right now, right now!!!

Great place to go for a happy hour with a large group of people....for the appetizers, beers, sports, the crowd and the drink selections. They have plenty of room for larger groups and have small, cozy spaces for a quick, couples escape to enjoy each other & good conversation.

Taco Tuesday ~ enough said!! Nice people working at this location, good food & always fresh! A line is always present in the drive thru and you never you know who you'll run into inside the restaurant. Clean place to have a bite OR go for take out! Its nice always being thanked for your business!

Want it done quick, right & great customer service...get it all right here! Not only was it done within three hours, he worked around my schedule so I could drop it off before opening, explained what it took to do the job, all off the costs involved and provided a warranty. In my book, that's how you build a great book of business! Thanks Ariel for a job well done!

They are always friendly when you go in and always have something good to watch on TV. I've been going there off & on for a couple of years and appreciate their service. Their cuts are great, conversations are good and probably the most relaxing atmosphere of all the barbers I've been to in the area!

This place does everything but change the oil on your vehicle! I've been a member for 4 years and have really enjoyed the gym a ton. I've been to other Lifetime Fitness locations and really appreciate the staff at my LTF! Everyone always, yes always, says hello or how are you doing; they even notice when I haven't been in for a while! The pricing on the food/shakes could be a little easier on the bank account but tastes great. I've been with other gyms in the west valley and have not found an atmosphere quite like the Lifetime Fitness in Goodyear.

Nino's is a one of those places you hear about, want to go & give it a try and drive past it over and over again until the stars line up right and the soccer team you are playing on is sponsored by Chrissy's Nino's Pizzeria!! How crazy is that?! It's a fun place to go for some beers, small pitchers are available :-), wings and pizza. The pizza is tasty and will fill you up, no mater how you want them to cut it for you! The wings are spot on with flavor and meat...some of the biggest wings I've seen in a restaurant ever!! They've got a pretty decent menu and does cater to those who are watching their figure more than the average soccer player with hearty salads!! They do have desert for the kids and enjoy having kids in the shop. I think the kids get a bigger kick out of going after Saturday night soccer than anyone! Go sit for a spell, have a few beers, grab some hot wings and a couple slices of pie! Great place to chill and watch life go by for a bit on Olive & 99th Avenue!!

Been in a couple of times and always a clean, relaxing time. David makes you comfortable, gives a great cut, loves his Cardinals and runs a great shop! The shop pays respect to barber shops gone by with the classic look & feel but also SportsCenter running.

Walk through the dark hallway, enter into the lunge and it completely opens up. The humidor is already facing you, so go make a selection. Decent selection of cigars and some which will surprise you. I'm no aficionado by any means but I have had my fair share of cigars from around this great, wide world. Good bartenders who are on top of their game with quick service and really know how to make you feel valued!  Enough space for chatting, drinks and cigars while enjoying the sounds of the live band kicking up tunes makes for a relaxing fun atmosphere. Go outside to enjoy the night air, seeing bunches of people relaxing in a pretty quiet patio, considering a live band is playing 30 feet away! Its a dark, quiet patio with a fire pit and enough space to not be over taken by the cigar smell for those in your party not enjoying one. Great views of the indoor area to include watching older gentlemen asking younger ladies for a dance in a kind, but lost sort of art.

I've gone a couple of times..one for brunch & one for dinner. I've been surprised both times! Going in & not knowing what to expect made it even better/easier to choose on the menu.  Huge pancakes with bacon induced bloody mary is a great combination!! Be ready to saddle up to the table with their huge, tasty flapjacks! They thought of lil details and did have sugar free syrup available.  Dinner is another great option with various twists on their dishes. Buttermilk chicken with mashed potatoes & vegetables hits the mark pretty close for this southern raised boy! Only one suggestion...try homemade biscuits that aren't so dry, no matter how much butter you throw at them. Just a thought...  Overall, our party was well taken care of on a busy night with the manager/owner even checking on guests to ensure they're enjoying themselves. Lil touches and new twists make this spot a good but unique place to grab a bite!

Went in on a Monday to relax and have a couple brews with friends. We weren't immediately available to order when Kristin came to take our order, besides beers. She eventually took our second round order with food. Her service was extremely slow and not personal. I have been in the service industry in a previous life and know you have to work to turn customers into regulars. This was clearly not an intention of hers. She did check back on us once to see if we needed anything but were okay at the time. We kept talking, hoping she'd come by to see if we were tasty to close out/wanted more or anything but nothing. After 45 minutes, with serious consideration for walking out, I had to go to the bar and ask her for the check. She was pretty nice at that point but it was beyond too late. Avoid the place on a Monday night for drinks!!!

I found Uptown Barbershop through a buddy who was going for the first time too. Great group of guys welcome you & treat you like one of the guys. They have a great setup with tv's to watch and talk sports, cold drinks and a cool vibe. Rony has great lineups of products no matter your hair type. Great thing is the products sell themselves but they take the time to teach you about them without any pressure. These fellas take the time to learn how you wear your hair, how often you normally cut it and work with you the whole time about getting a great cut the whole way. This truly was one of my top three haircuts I've ever had. I highly recommend Uptown Barbershop as your go to head shop from now on.
