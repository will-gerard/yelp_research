My Boyfriend and I ate there tonight for the first time and we really enjoyed the food. The Owner was there and very nice to us and it was a great balance of good food good atmosphere and reasonable prices. We will be back and bring some friends!

This barley got 2 stars. Took my family there for Mothers Day Brunch and although some of the breakfast items were tasty the rest was less than desirable. The table was filthy with gum under the chairs that you had to scoot in. The bathrooms were just disgusting. It was 100 outside and 85 inside. The server we had was sweet and attentive but the serving staff at the buffet were rude and presentation was not important to them at all. By the way assorted desserts really means some dry coffee cakes and nothing to write home about. Also they charged us for my nephew who should have been free and even Ice tea was not included in the brunch price. We will not being going back there. We did mention this to the Manager on our way out very politely and we just were looked at like we were crazy.. you win some and you loose some they just lost 5 customers :(
