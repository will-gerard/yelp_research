I am so expressed by the courtesy of the manager of this restaurant when my Agency had a fund raiser at the Arizona Cafe.  He invited our team to have lunch, gratis, after all the work we had done.    The service was excellent and the food very good.  I had the carnitas which were a little spicy for my liking but there was plenty of it and take home provided a lunch the next day.  I have GERD so maybe if I had not just had a stressful week, they would have agreed more with me.  The second lunch I had a few days later, a salad was even better, very fresh with a dressing that was not overpowering as they can be.  Once again, excellent service.  The only thing I regret was the weather was on the cold side.  It looked like the patio would have been a beautiful setting for a nice lunch.  I have no issues with suggesting you try the Canyon Cafe.

Recently a friend at the gallery was very excited because it was Dollar taco night a Chicos.  That is fine if you have any idea of where it is.  Turns out I had been by there more then a few times when I went to the Safeway and Subway at 7th st and McDowell.  It's a little place in a very small strip center.  It's very much a neighborhood place,  clean with an upbeat atmosphere and a few tables outside.  That's about all I can say about the setting.  I was surprised by the variety of meats that one can get on the tacos.  The tacos aren't  to exciting but on the whole are fresh and have a good flavor better than I would have expected.  That is all I had but from what I saw of the meals around me, hey looked pretty good as a whole.  I will go back to Chico's.  It definitely has fare that is better than the local fast food in the same price range.  Not an exciting place but pleasant to think of returning to.  I went there after a very long day so that is saying something.  Just the enjoyment of quite of the few people just sitting down and having a good time rubbed of on me.  I needed it!

I went to this little place for the first time today.  I can only say positive things about going there.  It was clean, the service friendly and efficient, the food was good.  I was impressed when Betsy, one of the owners came by to see if we were happy with our dinners. I liked the idea of wheat noodles. Finding out that they use only beta carotene veggies-no fillers like bean sprouts-and no oil in preparing them was even better news.  My fellow dinner had chicken a chicken curry which having sampled, I have to say I am going to try next time we go the Blu Fin.  My biggest surprise eating at the Blue Fin is the cheese cake they serve.  I don't profess to be a lover of cheese cake.  It never really impresses me.  It was light and the flavor was great.  Worth having for a birthday binge I am happy to report.

I am giving up on AT&T/Singular.  As long as I stayed with the cheapest cell phone I think known to man, they worked fine for me?  Three phones and a few years later I am giving up.  l am a caregiver for a lady who is older.  I can't tell you how many times she and other people have told me they can't get through to me when I haven't left the city limits.  If I am going to have a stupid cell phone-I could live with out it, I'd like to get at least 60% of my calls.  Verizion is always rated the highest in virtually every study I read.  It is also the most expensive which I can deal with if I can get my calls.  I can keep my same number and get better service-I Hope, I hope, I hope.

This week I suggested a friend take her rugs to McFalands.  I haven't had a reason to take anything to them recently but it's the ONLY place I would consider if I needed a rug cleaned.  That is how good my experience with them has been.  I happen to know that some of the most expensive rug dealer's, including antique, send all their work to McFarlands.    The location is a little out of the way and not the most exciting setting by any means but I am paying for the quality of the work not the look of the place.  If they say they can do it, you can count on the fact the job will be done right.  I have only had one question ever and they immediately redid the job to get it right.  Sometimes you have to wait a little longer to get your rugs clean but guess that's the price you pay for a place that is so popular that they can get swamped!  Nice people who are very professional in what they do.  I think their prices are reasonable,.  They might be a little higher than other places.  I don't know as I don't go any other place.  Check them out.!

I had a friend in the Emergency Department last month.  I can only say they should have admitted a friend of mine immediately but they didn't.  I am going to say nothing more about that experience.  I want to give an immediate five stars to Dr. Hurowitz of the Medical Sub specialty Clinic.  I will also give those five stars to the young gentleman at the front desk of said clinic.  I will edit this review to give that person's name and the name of a person from another department at a later date.  Why five stars to these people?  My friend was truly suffering from an acute flare up of rheumatoid arthritis.  When I arranged with the front desk to get a wheelchair stat the next day, it happened.  Dr. Hurowitz spent ten minutes with my friend and had her in a hospital bed forty five minutes later.  It was heartening to see a physician recognize that a fifty eight year old woman who could hardly walk and was swollen to about three times her body size all over had a real problem which is more than I could say for the ED Department.  On top of that, Dr. H showed an incredibly compassionate attitude in working with my friend, Mary Lou, and believe me she needed it.  We have been back to the clinic after Mary Lou spent five days in the hospital and had what seemed, every test know to man run on her and was seen by  as many Dr's in every area.  He is realistic enough with her to say that my friend's condition is unusual and there is more work to be done.  With both agree, that with a specialist like Dr. Hurowitz, what needs to be done will eventually occur.  He's that type of physician.  There is something to be said to having your care at a teaching hospital.

There are certain places that are like an old friend.  That is how I feel about going to this location of Macayos.  The food isn't the best Mexican food in the valley but it is consistent.  I can say that, I've been eating there since they opened this location.  I happen to like the type of Mexican food they serve.  I have no problem with ground beef as opposed to the  shredded beef they serve at other places that gets under my bridgework and drives me nuts.  I can't tell you much about the drinks which seem important to many people.  The strongest I do is cranberry juice with actual lime juice which the actually remember to do when I ask for it at Macayos.  Cranberry juice with a few crushed limes doesn't do it for me.  I used the brain God gave me and stopped drinking alcohol years ago but I still like something at least with some flavor...  It is a good place to take friends when you just want to have a pleasant meal and talk.  Consistently, the wait staff is pretty jovial and most have been there for awhile.  The interior is in keeping with this same laid back attitude.  It isn't fancy but who is going to eat the interior?

I don't play the guitar but I always had hear about Ziggie's. so one day I just stopped in.    I appreciated the owner not treating me like I had an eye in the center of my forehead when I told her the same.  I ended up stay for a half hour or more and just chatting.  I watched how she interacted with people who came in and knew what they wanted done.  Overall it was was really positive considering I didn't understand half of what they were talking about.  Ziggie's reminds me of the stores I use to go to where things were personal.  You got to know the owner so when you went in, you weren't a stranger.  If you play the guitar or a stringed instrument, it is really worth your time to check this store out, I believe.  4 stars instead of five because my whole review is based on just a feeling I got about the store.  if I was a guitar person, I believe it would easily be a 5.

This is a tricky one to write.  Have you ever known someone who is at a place emotionally where if it gets any worse, they are probably going to have to be hospitalized for their own safety.  Friendship is a place to go before it gets to the point.  They offer in hospital treatment  where a person can still go home at night.  Transportation is not a problem if you are at a place where you don't drive, or don't drive.  Meals are also provided.  And, while, Friendship is a not program for detox, but if you are clean and want to stay that way they can work with you,  A dual diagnosis does not mean there is no hope for you at Friendship.  Friendship offers two types of treament programs.  One is a program that starts in the morning and last until the afternoon.  It is really designed for a person who just doesn't have a clue as to where to start on their recovery from mental illness, or someone who functions but never has had a chance to actually learn how to do it.  For people who are higher functioning, there is an afternoon program that really focuses on the processes you have already learned and how to use them more successfully.  I am not going to begin to say what you do is easy at Friendship.  It requires work on the part of the individual.  What is unique about Friendship is even if you have no desire to do the work it takes to recover, they will teach you through group work that you are capable of doing it.  I am proof of the fact that it works.  An added advantage of the program is you are always welcome back.  I'd like to say that anyone who graduates from Friendship is going to handle things from there on out with no problems.  That is never the case. There will always be problems.  If at some time in the future you recognize you are becoming overwhelmed, you can go back.  Friendship's staff is really a dedicated group that truthfully want to assist someone who is dealing with emotional or mental health issues to achieve a happier more effective life.  If that wasn't their goal I guarantee you they would not last.  From Gus who will first contact you, (I remember thinking Gus, sounds like a moron's name, before I met him-but at that point in my life, I would have thought the same of Mother Theresa) to Erika and Shawn in the front office, to the staff, everyone is there to help you regain your health.  They work with you on everything including dealing with your insurance company.  While they can't do everything for You, you will have their support along the way!  I simply can not say how much Friendship means to me personally.  It is there for you or someone you love as well.

Three years later, I still give Friendship five stars.  I can still recommend it and do.  I have been back there myself.  It doesn't get much better than what this organization does for you.  Yes it's a lot of work but when it comes to improving the quality of your life, it's work well done.

It's been five years and I am back at Friendship Community Mental Health Center.  For me it is still the alternative to having myself hospitalized for depression-major depression.  Would I rather not having to be doing this, of course, but needs to be done so here I am again.  Before I decided to write an update of Friendship CMH. I asked myself does that first review still apply.  I have been in the program for six weeks now and can say for all intents and purposes, yes.  Is it still tricky to write the update, yes. But if it would help one individual to deal with the depths that mental ill ness can take you to, it is worth it to do so again.    One bit of information I will approach this time that I didn't in the first review.  Most insurance plans do cover treatment at Friendship so if you need it take advantage of that fact.

This is an interesting place to do some shopping at.  I never know quite what I am going to find there so usually I buy a few things that I don't plan on.  This time I picked up some rather expensive pens at quite a nice markdown.  They have a more complete inventory I would expect to find in an small office/stationary store.  I think the prices are well with in reason depending on what you need  You can spend money if you want to.  The services they offer are more extensive than I would expect to find in a store that doesn't come close to the size of a Staples.  It took me only two trips to get satisfactory business cards ready to be printed.  Not bad when you consider I went in with really no idea of what it would to take to get what I wanted.  The personal touch of their employees makes a difference.  There's a nice little gift shop next door that can help you save you a trip if you are looking for some things the Stockroom doesn't have.

Having been dealing with the stockroom for some years now, I'm upping them to a five stars now.  Recently I ordered some things and remembered something I haven't said in my past review.  If these people say they will call you concerning an order, they do, and promptly!  As much driving as I do,  their doing so has really saved me time when I organize what I am going to do during a day.  Funny thing is they are close to where I live which, of course, always makes them hardest to get to, LOL.

I would like to give Karsh's 4 stars and here are the reasons why.  If you want kosher, they have it.  If you'd like to have sugar free, they have a nice variety, provided you go in early in the day.  They actually have quite a nice variety-a little something for everybody-and they do take orders.  Sound's good doesn't it.  What is not good is the schizophrenic nature of the service you get at this place.  I can deal with their prices which are higher than they should be.  I won't deal with holding my breath and wondering if the person helping me is going to be pleasant or borderline nasty. It's been that way for sometime and isn't getting any better.  The result is for the most part I tend to avoid the place.  Scott's Generations, the deli a few doors down, is more appreciative of your business.  I'll spend my money there.  Their bagels are better and they have bialy's, too.  If you are going to chance this place, I have one suggestion for you.  DON'T go in near closing.  Likely as not, you will be told you exactly how many minutes you have before they close.  They are blatant about doing this especially if you aren't ready to tell them exactly what you want at that moment.  I guess the fact they are emptying the cases in front of your eyes is not clue enough they are closing.     Another reason not to go there is not their fault.  They are off of 7th Street with the traffic lanes that change with the time of day.  I'll face the craziness those lanes cause to go to the Bashas and Scott's Generation but not  Karsh's.    It's rather sad to have to write a review like this.

For Valentine's day, I wanted to get my friend something a little nice to celebrate the day so went to Karsh's.  How many times do you celebrate someones 89th valentines day.  I walked in and looked at the cases.  I hear laughing in the back.  I walked around and looked at all the cases again.I saw the asst manager look through the window to see if someone was out there.  I looked through all the cases twice more and walked out and went to Bashas.    Maybe they don't like me there?  A week later I went to buy some marbled rye bread there because didn't have the time to go to LaGrande Orange. Two people immediately asked to help me.  This place does something to my head.  I wish I could like the idea of going there.  I DON'T but do so for my friend only now.

This is the place I always used to go to after I left the bars when I was younger.  I remember being so absolutely plastered one afternoon that I sat down and to this day am certain I had two big macs there.  (Any doubt why I quite drinking twenty five years ago???)  Fortunately a professor from ASU wouldn't let me drive for another two hours.  The location is convenient for getting in and out of late at night.  What really makes it interesting is the people from the neighborhood around it. If you are a people watcher you might really like it here.  You just never know what you'll see from the man who regularly parks his wheelchair by the drive through and solicits money to...   It's nothing special but holds some memories for me.

I have to assume this is what a good Jewish deli and restaurant is all about.  The prices are reasonable and you get enough to fill you up. I almost always end up taking something home.  No "the food was like poison and the portions were so small!"  They have a menu with more of a selection than I would expect for being a smaller place.  You can always find the day's paper to read and they do have outside seating.  The service is pleasant, not the type you get in a chain place.  Maybe it doesn't have the ambiance of some places but it's homey and clean and I appreciate that.  They also have take out. Usually I take something home with me from the deli.  I will deal with the craziness of the reversible lanes on 7th Street to go here!

If there was no other reason to go to Scott's, go for there bialy's and the take home.  I still have no idea what a real jewish deli should be but this has got to be close to it from what I've seen of it over the years. (Need to go to New York and try a few there to find out, I guess.)  Go early for the bialy's. or ask them to hold some for you.  They run out fast.  This place grows on you.

First of all "first to review credit" needs to go to Mirabella G!  I tried to inform Yelp management of this, but can't figure out how to so want to give credit where credit is due, myself.  Now to my review.  This is a great store to go in if you have absolutely no idea of what your doing or close to it, like myself.  It probably is a much better place to go if you do.  They have a little of everything and a lot of everything.  I say that because I am of the opinion that the more you know about what you are doing, the more you will find.  Suffice it to say you can find an incredible amounts of fabrics and accessories when you walk in the door; just be ready to dig to find what you want.  I go to SAS when I am looking for fabrics and buttons in order to replace dresses for my 90 year old friend.  These are garments that just are not made anymore. I don't sew but my Mother did or I would be pretty much lost when I go in.  I have no shame so I am likely to ask for help from anyone in the store-employee or customers. The attitude is such that most of the people shopping there are really nice.  I was trying to decide to between two fabrics when a really older lady walked by who looked really good in what she was wearing.  She was willing to tell me which one she appealed to her and that's the one I purchased.   The employees are another story,    Some really are more helpful than others depending on what you are trying to do.  I think that is partly because they are always so busy. I've never seen the SAS store slow.  So, don't let one put you off, eventually, you'll find another who will help you especially if you are desperate like me.  The prices here really are great which is why it is worth it to go in and dig.  It is a great people watching place, besides.  Not for the faint of hear, this store is, but it can be a lot of fun.

Occasionally I just feel like going out for just basic breakfast, i come to this particular MacDonald's.  It's a place to have a big breakfast and watch some of the interesting people that you now are regulars among others. It's always clean and the service pretty quick. it's by no means and exciting venue!   is okay for what it is.  I am not a big breakfast eater so it serves the purpose when I am in that particular mood.  When I am traveling I often go to a MacDonald's for breakfast.  I usually need to eat something and can count on pretty standard fare and a decent price.  If it's just before catching a plane in the morning, a Greek meal that I might prefer first thing in the morning might not set well at takeoff as a big breakfast..

This is a store that you really can't beat. it reminds me of the variety stores that I used to go to when I was a kid that had a little bit of everything.  The location isn't fancy-an old strip center-but I am not going in there for fancy.  You see the same staff, young and older, when you go in and they get to know you.  This is one of those stores you can walk in not knowing quite what you need (speaking from personal experience) and they will make real effort to find it for you. They are always up to date on what they have in stock and have some pretty good "true value discounts."  They also carry some of those things you don't think are made any more or what you'd expect to have to find in a specialty store. I didn't even know that they make plastic screws, did you ?  I know if I can't find it at Koller's, I might as well just go to Home Depot because only a really big store is going to have what I want.  I personally prefer to support smaller stores. I like the convenience of getting what I want and getting out easily.  I also appreciate the fact that the people at Koller's do appreciate my business and remember who I am.  This is a nice place, for a hardware store, to write a review about.  One tip.  There is parking in the back which saves you from having to hope there is a space open in the front-saves time!.

I have been going to this restaurant for years.  It has maintained it's quality even when it has changed owners.  There is a funky lady there that has worked there for a long time-17 Years? She always remembers you and makes your experience more fun.  Always good food, Always good service. It is a fun little place to go but won't impress someone who is more interested in "atmosphere" than in good food and company. This city could use more small restaurants like this that just don't follow the norm.  Speaking of following the norm.  You do need to check when they are open.  Their hours are a little different. It is well worth making a trip to this little place when they are open.    (I usually go there when I am planning on going to the Sprouts in the same center.  I can walk off a few calories after I'm done with dinner!)

Why would a person want to go into a place where they virtually never get your order right.  How does an order for 2 large pomegranate smoothies with wheat grass blended in become half a banana with a side of wheat grass and a small pomegranate smoothie with a side of wheat grass?  What is worse when the fellow making the order argues with you that the order is right and you are wrong?  This is typical of the place.  A friend likes to go in there or they'd never see me again.  I make them read back what I order or they don't get my AMEX,   You can make then print out an itemized receipt.  I'd suggest it.   In all fairness, I can tell you they have gotten my order correct one and a half times.  That's not saying much is it.  The company could also spend a little money on some sound proofing this place.  I agree with Nadia C, with all the mixers going and the music, it's not some place you want to be for long.  But, they could spend the money to train their staff to learn how to ring orders properly, so making the place a little more quiet obviously is wishful thinking.  The parking leaves a lot to be desired now that the Verizon office is a few doors down from them.  You'd better be fast when there is an empty spot or it can really become ugly.  The best thing I can say for the place is they have good oatmeal.  I have truly enjoyed writing this review!  If you really want a much better smoothie go to Robeks on the NE corner of 16th and Camelback,  It's cleaner, nicer set up, and they have a magic ability to get your order right.

You want to get rid of stuff you aren't wearing but is still in current style or is traditional and will always look good.  If it is in good shape and  came from Needless Markdown, or Bags Fourth Street,  and not from Tarjet or Wally world, then consign it at Well Suited.  While you are there, it is natural to want to look around and usually you can find something that is easy to take home.  One word of warning.  This is not a thrift shop so don't expect prices like you find a Saver's or Goodwill.  I sent a friend there who was expecting just that and he was sorely disappointed.   A man should be able to go in to Well Suited, and if he wanted, walk out with a really nice wardrobe, both dress and casual,  from head to toe including acessories such as watches, shoes, belts ties and sunglasses all at reasonable prices.  There are some really good buys to be had here.  Most of the merchandise is designer with labels you will know.  If you don't,  ask Jenny or her staff.  If they don't know, they will look it up on the internet.  The other day I saw a t shirt from Barcelona by  a Spanish designer who is at the top of his game.  i know what this man's clothes run, and at $37, it really was a steal.  I do think what this store has over other men's reale stores is a staff that makes you feel welcome and helps you as you want help.  They are as friendly to someone in their 70's as they are to men in their 20's and you see as many of one as the other.  A good example of this is what I saw on the fourth of July., A young man from Lithuania, obviously a regular customer, came in with his mother and sister.  Neither of them spoke English, or knew American sizes.  He was certain, that,  Jenny, the men's manager, who "is one of my best friends in America" will know what to do!  I asked her after she got the ladies set up next door how she knew him, maye she had been dating him.   She said no, he was just a customer who drove in from Glendale to shop with them. It didn't surprise me in the least. I felt comfortable asking Jenny that as I have know her since she graduated from high school.  I know the work she puts into making it a great place for a man to shop at.   Excellent merchandise is not enough if men don't feel at ease shopping at a men's store.  When it comes to shopping, a man always needs a place like this!  I'm just afraid one of these days someone is going to steal her away to Sedona one of her favorite places!  Just so you know, when they sell your things, you have the choice of getting cash or taking it in trade.  Wise individuals, they want you to keep you money on account and spend it there, so they give you more when you take it in trade.  Don't be surprised though if your Raybans that you have never worn don't bring as much as you think.  Jenny will probably gets you as much as your going to get unlike another store at 32nd Street and Shea.  I about threw up when I saw what they got two pairs of unworn Merrill boots  I took there just to try some place different for a change  I'm not going to say I'd never consider going to another place and see what they have to offer.  I just know Well Suited is a consistently comfortable place for a man to enjoy going in and doing some shopping and that isn't all that bad!  Just thought to say something about two different things.  Ever gotten a gift card to someplace that is going to take you forever to find something you need to use it? The money you take in trade can be used at any of the stores of this group which includes women's and furniture and accessory stores.    Even better, I think is what happens if something  you consign doesn't sell.  You can take it back or they will donate it to a group that supports no kill animal shelters.   I appreciate the owners of the company for supporting this very worthy cause.

Still a great place to shop and Jen is still there.  Good news-they are taking both summer and winter things now.  Usually when I am ready to clean out my closets, it's the wrong time to take what I want to get rid of..  Take advantage of it!

Every time I go into this particular store, I wonder why do I ever go any place else. There are other stores closer to my house but it is worth it to make the drive. The attitude of the staff is terrific.  Rarely do I find they don't have what I want in stock.  It reminds me of the hardware stores I used to go to as a kid.  They always had a little of everything and someone to help you find it.  If not, usually some one could make a suggestion as to what else might be used or where to find it. The "good old days" never went away with this store. How many stores can you walk into and say you need red  laquer color paint-the ornate chinese type and they will walk you to it!  From the front to the back, this store is the best!

I needed to have some large tropical plants given some TLC.  They needed new soil and whatever necessary to keep them healthy in the future.  It wasn't to expensive at all.  This company has been in the same place for years so that in itself makes for a good recommendation of their services.  They do sell some plants and will come out to your house and set up an indoor plant system and maintain it among other things.  I have been in their from time to time over the years but only to buy some indoor plants.  Check them out, it's an interesting  little store.  The employees are always nice and have never been pushy.  I appreciate that.  They are moderate to pricey but they can provide you with nice things in the area of tropical plants that you might not find so easily elsewhere.

I have had this company to do work on my house, cut glass for picture frames, and replace windshields in my car.  They seem well run and organized.  If you need a new windshield, American Glass will do all your paperwork for you and come to your house or work or you can go to one of their locations.  You don't even have to contact your insurance company.   Less work for me and more time to do other things I rather be doing!  Your insurance company may tell you you have to use a certain company but I found out that isn't true. This company works with all the insurance companies through a computer system.  They leave your house or car clean when they are done-I can deal with that.  Their central Phoenix phone number is 602-957-9791, but they have other locations.   I should say that these people did one thing that really impressed me.  I went by to arrange a time to come in and have them replace my windshield.  My broken windshield wasn't the kind that had a dark strip across the top, something I think you absolutely need in AZ. I told them that kind was what I wanted it replaced with.  When their office person was ready to call and order it to be there when I came in, she double checked to be sure of the specific model of the year of the car was that I was driving.   Turns out they had made some change for that particular year and model,  I wouldn't have thought it would have made a difference.  It did.  I appreciated her diligence in making sure what she ordered was what I needed.  Also, their office was clean and they had up to date magazines in the waiting room.  A little thing, but very nice.

I'm glad when I can two or three years later say that I am still comfortable recommending a company like American Glass.    As I was pulling out of the emissions testing place with a friend's Alero, I started rolling the electric window up when it went woosh/clunk down into the door. It didn't come back up.  I went to the place I always go when I have any problem with glass.   When the service man determined what was wrong, he saved me money by sending me to Reilly's to get the part instead of a dealership.  They fixed it and I am a happy camper.

These people have gone out of their way to help me make the mac I bought from ASU Surplus functional. They did not charge me for anything they did, including loading a new operating system.  I admit I really started started worrying the fourth trip back as to the hope for this unit. A gwoing  group of the technicians were clustered around my machine all throwing out ideas about how to fix the particular issues.  I respect them for finally saying no one had any idea what more they could do to make it work.  I would recommend this particular store for their great service!  They certainly tried for me.

After my disastrous experience with trying to buy a used computer from ASU (only about $500 for something that can't be used) anything but the word brand new can upset me.  I went to this apple store after going to a competitor and can say they really helped me save money.  I went in ready to buy a new unit when one young man said why not buy refurbished on line and have it delivered.His logic waas that they had gone farther through a refurbished machine when they got it back than with the regular brand new machines.  Something to be said for his line of thought I thought about this long and hard and checked what was available online for a month.  Later I went back and worked with an associate named Jessica who showed me logically that I was going to spend more money than I needed to, about $500 dollars!?!.  The refurbished unit came in faster than i expected/  I took my old machine that had half the tech staff came out looking at it and saying "It still works?"  They loaded the new one with the info from the old  machine and got it the same day.  Later that evening, I realized nothing was going as it should in updating necessary information.  The  next day, I made and appoint meant and hauled everything over there.  My final contact was with a delight flu woman named Elizabeth.  She proceeded to show me that about half of what I had load off the old machine wasn't necessary and would have caused exactly what was going wrong.   I can't tell you how much time she took to remove things I didn't need.  She also explained something to me that I think should have been told before.  Safari is a product of Mac, I was not  this  before. In my opinion, it only  makes sense to use it when I am on a macintosh computer.  From seeing what Elizabeth work today, I realized I've run into problems previously because no one told me about she benefit of using safari and mac together.  Yeah, Jessica, for saving me money!  Elizabeth for her smile when she went through the tedious process of ridding my new machine of things I didn't need!  There were two other gentlemen who I have to apologize for not remembering their names/  Overall, definitely a five star experience, inspire of a crying baby and a busy weekend crowd.

I have done volunteer withe Ballet AZ for the last years.  It is a an accomplished company with a splendid school attached.  The first thing I can say is when most regional companies have gotten smaller, Ballet AZ keeps growing. Ib Anderson, the Artistic Director, danced with Balanchine in New York.  He will not do a ballet that he doesn't know he his company can do and do well.  In watching his him work, I feel he has the ability to make everyone in the company feel what they have to offer is of great value from the newest member to the principal dancers.  There is less "attitude" in this company than I have ever seen.  The dancers are hard workers who want as good as what Ib asks of them and that is a great deal.  The people you don't see such as the people who do the costumes and the sets  do a remarkable job of making things happen that sometimes start as nothing more as idea of Ib's.  When I first started working with this group, i was surprised when I heard people say this and that was as good as they'd seen all over the world.  I am not surprised now.  Ballet AZ has brought together dancers from all over the world due to it's excellent reputation. These professionals have come to take advantage of working in an organization that is striving for something better each production than the one before.   If in some areas, Phoenix has  long way to go in catching up in the arts, the Ballet is not one of them.  We have a fine company here in AZ that continues to excel in presenting varied productions that range from the classics to world premieres.  Prices are quite reasonable for what is offered.  There are different packages that make it even more attractive with special prices on certain dates.  Contact the box office abut that.  Another way to see the shows is to join the volunteer organization.  We work hard but the end result is the pleasure of knowing we help make a beautiful thing like Ballet AZ blossom and grow.

Thought I should update my last experience concerning the volunteering situation at Ballet AZ.  I waited a couple of years and went back and offered my services.  Must have been my instincts because i delayed sending them the paperwork.  Just as well because I was told soon after they "rescinding" their offer to have me do volunteer work with them???  This happened awhile back now, but last I heard the same people are handling that area so doubt if things have changed any.    You be the judge

The Book Gallery is not your typical book store.  If you want just a basic retail book store, Borders-I shop a lot there-Bookstar, and that type are available.  Book Gallery is something special.  The inventory is of books that one probably isn't going to find in the other stores.  Mike, the owner, buys books for people looking for something t more specific to the areas a person might be interested in.  As to service, you can receive it at this store.  The employees are more laid back and don't follow the (ninety second rule to say hello) most of the large stores are supposed to follow.  The majority of the customers that come in are coming to this store to look for merchandise they won't find other places. It is enjoyable to see what gem is available there at any given time without being bothered.  However, just ask. and the employees will go out of their way to find what you need from books small artistic items to music.  I will admit that there is one employee I'd rather not have help me but that is a personality thing.  At any time, they will call the Mesa store to see if they have something there and have it in Phoenix in a day or two.  They also will keep an out for something if you ask.  Mike, the owner, enjoys buying knickknacks, book ends, and just other small things that make delightful and unusual gifts.  I have a friend that is just so hard to buy for.  I found a small piece of De Grazia sculpture that I didn't even know was made.  The very reasonable price surprised me.  I expected to pay more because many of the things there you can't  buy other places.  I don't consider myself to be a snob.   I have a great time shopping at Goodwill.  I am realistic in knowing I should expect to pay more for something the owner has personally selected for some unique quality.    Concerning the prices of the books in Book Gallery, they will depend on the merchandise you are considering.  I happen to be a science fiction fan. I always find very reasonable prices on older paperbacks from two or three dollars and up. One day I found a signed copy of one of the Dune series and I paid considerably more.  It only made sense. It cost more than the original price, but  considering the author is dead, how many more are going to be signed-zilch, none!  Besides, how many stores would have it available for purchase anyway..  This store has another quality that really appeals to me and that is plenty parking!  It's a great place to go browse before or after going to one of the other interesting stores or restaurants in this small center.  So I am a snob for shopping at a small unique bookstore with merchandise that isn't typical.  Quality means more to me than quantity.  I find quality at Book Gallery.  Check it out!

I find it humorous to read the reviews on this store.  It is now has the third highest sales of any Tuesday Morning stores in Arizona while being the smallest.  (I asked)  To accomplish that a store has to be fairly well organized with good service.  I consider this store to be a real gem!  I don't have to pay the prices of Fashion Square or the Biltmore or deal with it takes to find a parking place there either. (Don't get me wrong, I like both of those places as well, I use them just for point of comparison.) Nine times out of ten i can go in there, find what I want and get out if I want to.  The problem is I usually look around a bit and go home with maybe a bit more than I expected.  Obviously in a store that carries as man better name close outs in as small a place as it is, one does have to keep a sharp eye out, and maybe do a little digging.  Who cares, treasure is to be found.  I have found this store to be infectious.  Every time I go there I seem to find a better price on something than the time before. Be it something for the yard, gifts for the kids, entirely to expensive sheets for the bed, crystal, monogrammed thank you note's, something for the my cat, Picasso, they are all there and waiting..  I took a friend there the other day who complained they didn't have prices like Goodwill.  The truth is this person is not a shopper and never will be.  If you are a shopper, you'll recognize the quality is at prices that make sense.   Another minor but really nice thing about the Tuesday Morning stores is the music they play when you are there.  At major dept stores you hear music that has been selected by a team to maximize sales according to critical factors.  The owner of Tuesday Morning picks the music you listen to.  I like his taste and usually find myself humming a tune at some time before I leave which is usually with more than I planned on.  I will talk about the service which is unique to this store.  Depending on the lines of customers waiting to be rung up, they may or may not greet you as you come in.  Usually I find they do.  If you just aren't finding what you are looking for, you might have to to be the one to seek out  one of their people and ask them concerning what you are looking for.  At this point, I am usually very afraid.   They are going to steer me to an area where even if I don't see what I asked for, something will be there that will work.  I just have to decide which or how many!  I haven't discussed the wonderful yellow Clearance signs have I?   I look at prices that really can't be beat on things that I probably will use for some thing  at some time.  If I can't see why they are marked down, or there is a flaw that I can live with,  I have this good habit of buying them.  The result is I never really have to shop for the holiday, birthdays or you name it.  I  dig in the back of my hall closet closet and usually something is there that will suffice.  Tuesday Morning is truly one of the stores that helps keep that closet well stocked.    Visit this location.  It is worth me starting the great American novel on shopping?!?

The mark of a five star business is when it stays five star. It's been over three years now and my thoughts on this location of Tuesday Morning haven't changed.  Also, for as small a store as this is could they provide what I needed for a very specific occasion?   Everyday shopping there is always nice- great variety, but when the Chips are Down?!?   Yes,  they came through again!!!  Example - - -My niece was due to have a c section the next morning.  Great Uncle Dave to be realized he'd forgotten to buy gifts for the new great nephew.  I went straight to this store ready to buy and so I did.  They had an excellent selection of clothes for a new born and up.  With my help this is going to be one well dressed young gentleman, and at prices I could live with!  Thank you, Tuesday Morning on Indian School.  Most important!  Baby Donovan is 7 lbs, 6 ounces, and 20 inches and truly a handsome little fellow...

This is my kind of place.  I used to really enjoy going to Sakowitz years ago and having lavosh and cheese in the midst of my shopping.  I can do this at Postino.  There is a sense of the quiet and the casual where a man (or woman) can sit back, have most pleasant snacks, and let the world go by.  I have found places like this on the coast and am happy to find one like it in Phoenix.  I wouldn't go here for a "full blown" meal but it wouldn't be the place it is if I were going to.  In the hustle and bustle of today's world, Postino can provide you a welcome retreat.  It is needed.

Bakers is the best from plants to those concrete gnomey kind of things that can inhabit your lawn and garden.  I have been going to Bakers for about 54 years.  When I was a little child I went with my mother, a woman who could literally grow anything and did, in the AZ heat.  The result I have seen just about any situation you can think of being dealt with using Bakers, successfully most of the time.  Truthfully, I have always had such a good experience here that anytime I have used anyone else, I end up returning.  They just can't be beat.  They answer your questions nicely about their tremendous supply of just about anything at any given time.  If your desire to garden never goes past house plants, they are just as much for you. They won't lie to you about what they sell. Don't expect to go home  from Bakers with what you planned on.  It will usually be more.

I still think that Baker's is the best nursery in the Valley.  For business reasons I literally go from what it seems from North to South and a lot of places otherwise.  I deliberately stop in at a lot of nurseries, so have a lot to compare with when I say that. I like growing things and in the middle of a busy day a few minutes at a nursery can be a nice break.  All in all,  Baker's, it seems to me, still provides the best personal service.  They know their product and will work for you at whoever your knowledge level is.  They are also very good about checking with you to help you find what you want.  I like that as looking all over is something I don't always have time for.  This is as opposed to one of their competitors where they could find you dead of a heart attack at the end of the day when they were closing and wonder where you came from!   Speaking of Big box stores as to going to a local nursery like Baker's...  There is a place for the big box stores and I'd be a liar if I didn't say I haven't bought plants there.  What happened on Wednesday, though, reminded me of why usually I'd rather just at start at Baker's.  I was looking for a  a particular variety of a certain plant.  I saw the plant but not the variety I wanted.  I was told they didn't have it.  I happened to see a representative of one of the big plant companies that supplies the big box stores. I can tell you from past experience these people are a different breed!  I know to handle them very carefully  as  they usually they just don't want to be bothered. There job is to get the product out there and be on there way, I guess.   I asked him if his company supplied this variety. I specifically told him I'd be happy to buy his brand if he had them.   He said they didn't.  When I said it wasn't that important as I was sure I know where I could get them, he asked where.  When I said Bakers, you'd have thought I had said an evil word.  From the look I got, he must consider this one local nursery to be a threat to his major brand?   I bought the specific variety I wanted at Baker's this afternoon and the price was more reasonable than for the common variety at the big box store to boot!

I found out Bakers is closing the last day of December this year.  I can't imagine taking care of my house and backyard without them.  No very often can I truly say that the closing of a business is a real loss.  This is!  This has always been a a ten star place!

Today Baker Nursery closed.  I've been going there for 59 years so I feel like part of my personal history has been affected.  One of my earliest memories was how grand I felt the day I could finally stand on the wooden steps and get a drink out of the water fountain without having to be lifted up.  If I had had a bad day, just stopping at this wonderful place made even the darkest of days a little brighter.  Thanks to the Baker family for many years of fine memories!

I had to rent a wheel barrow.  I had a choice of going to this company or another nearer to my home.  I chose the company nearer to my home which was a little less expensive where I got an older one that was older and heavier.  One days use  I went to A to Z to look at what I could get for a little more money which turned out to be newer and lighter.  They didn't think I was nuts to want to look at the actual equipment and took the time to go into the actual storage warehouse and show it to me.  They also gave me the one that I thought was the newest and cleanest-long story there as to why I needed that one.  Overall a five star experience, I would recommend going here.  Maybe a little more expensive but the quality of the rental experience and the equipment itself says five stars to me.

I don't know who does the hiring at Park Ave but whoever it  is certainly knows what they are doing.  The staff here is really young but they are service oriented.  I wish I could find more places with the attitude they have here.  The prices are low, the cleaning is done well, and if there is any question they will redo the garment.  They keep the price low is by taking cash and checks.  Don't expect to use a credit card.  There isn't a lot of parking so you may have to park in the parking lots on both sides of the building.  Never hurts to burn a few calories.  I have been using these people for so many years that I really don't remember...maybe 30?  Nice place to do business with.  I worked in retail for many years.  Most of the major stores I worked in, this is where the majority employees took their dry cleaning  Work clothes had to last, so if you wanted things done right, you went here for a price one could afford.

The Blue Saguaro is a place you'd probably not find unless someone told you about it, I can agree with Erica on that one.  The interior is nothing to right home about .  It is nice enough for what it is and that is just a nice little cafe style restaurant catering to the surrounding businesses.  Now let's start talking about what makes this restaurant great and that is the food.  It's simply a nice little restaurant that proves if you have good food it will be successful.  I am saying that on the basis that everything I saw served looked put together right.  I had the Mediterranean Vegetarian Sandwich.  The bread was nice and fresh which was the start of a really tasty  meal. It didn't taste like the bread at some places that give you a variety of 8 different kinds but they all suffer from a bland sameness. There was plenty of hummus, feta, roasted peppers, all in about the proper combination so as not make any one overbearing.  There was also plenty of it, enough to fill you up but not enough to make you feel like Jabba the Hutt.  I am looking forward to going back to the Blue Saguaro and trying their breakfast sandwich.  I was ten minutes to late to get one but boy did the ones I saw look yummy!  This is a real compliment from me.  I am not a big breakfast eater and am likely to end up at MacDonald's just be cause their big breakfast is usually consistent.  I admit if I am going out for breakfast, usually the place I go is going to be fairly expensive.  Not at the Blue Saguaro.   The prices are quite reasonable.   This is one of those reviews that really has been writing.  Thanks, Blue Saguaro!

The food here gives a whole new meaning to the word bland.  That makes this an ok place because most anybody could eat what they serve without any complaints.  It is a good place to take a family or for a big eater.  You get food and lots of it.  It kind of makes me think of pigs when you see them at a feeding trough.  What they get may not be good, but they walk away full, happy piggys.  Carlos O'briens sends out lots of happy oinkers!  Did you pick up on the subtle hint that this may not be the place for those who are looking for something special when they want to have Mexican food?  I hope (lol).  I debated on two or three stars.  I wouldn't go back there myself-two stars.  If I had a family to feed or people from out of town who don't need to be impressed-three stars.  I'd rather be positive than negative so they get three.

When is a better time to write a review of a hospital that when you have spent the last eleven hours at their ER with a 90 year old woman who took a bad fall.  Kudos to Matthew who was able to find a vein and get a IV started after the other Nurse that I will call "N"  obviously couldn't do it. She suddenly just walked away with not a word of explanation.   Next thing I knew, Matthew showed up with no word of explanation.  I don't blame him; what was he told?  This was just the beginning of the next hours I spent trying to get any explanation of what was going on at any given time about anything.  I have spent more than a few hours in ER's at different Valley hospitals.  This had to be the worse.   Kudos to Pam in Radiology.  She and her two female helpers went out of their way to make a traumatic experience a little less so for my little friend,  Norma.  As for the rest of the staff in ER.  No thanks to any of you for the efforts I had to go to to really be informed as to what was happening in those hours.  No thanks to you for setting her up for a heart monitor and leaving it on standby.  Why turn in on for a 90 year old lady with a severe heart murmur.  No thanks for telling me that her IV wouldn't drip because of the position of her arm.  If you had told me how her arm had to be positioned for it to keep working, I could have monitored it.  Instead it didn't drip.  I could be say more but I think Yelpers are more than capable of reading between the lines, and have caught my drift...  I had hear less than complimentary comments about Paradise Valley Hospital over the years.  I always chalked up a certain amount of it to how people were affected by the stress of the situation involved.  It really was as bad as I had heard this evening.  I am glad I could say some good things but they certainly weren't enough to suggest considering going there.

"Fine dining" is not just a setting.  it isn't just good food.  It is many things that add up to an attitude. I have had the opportunity to find it in different cities. I found it the other night at the Stockyards.  We were seated by a host who took us to our table and when we were properly seated gave us menus.  Our server came to the table and introduced herself and said she would return shortly.  It was nice to have a moment to chat before we had to think about ordering.  When she did return,  our glasses were filled-not something we should have  to wait for her to do when the service is right.  She knew the selections on the menu and all available options and could make sensible comments concerning them.  Our salads were served promptly by two additional people and were as fresh as I could ask for.  When my friend was finished with hers they asked if they could take her plate.  I was pleased when they didn't ask me if I was finished with my salad and could they take my plate.  If I'd been finished I could have told them.  We were able to continue our conversation uninterrupted as I finished my salad.  The salad plate was removed  when it was appropriate and we had a few minutes before the entrees were served.  All was in keeping with a relaxed dining.  At no time did I have to think about having drinks refilled, it just happened quietly.  After a few minutes our dinners were served by the two gentlemen and our server appeared to make sure they were to our satisfaction before we started.  There was no room for error there that couldn't be resolved before we started.    My friend had ordered a small steak. My friend is  quite elderly and Kathy, our server, discretely asked her if she'd like it cut for her.  A potato also was served with her dish.  I asked my friend which of the condiments she would like it prepared with.  She look at me and said "Prepared with?" She didn't understand what I was getting at but Kathy did and was already reaching for the potato.   She opened the potato and smiled while my friend said a bit of everything.  One doesn't go to a restaurant like the stockyards to have to deal with opening a hot potato and preparing it.   When serving is done properly, these things don't have to be discussed.  Kudos to, Kathy!!!.  That is part of the fine dining experience.  I had a full rack of ribs which were so tender the meat fell of them.  The sauce had spice to it but not so strong the flavor of the meat was concealed.  I also can tell you that unless you are a big eater, half a rack would fill most people.  My friend said, "Yummy!"  and I agreed.  I am used to getting a finger bowl for clean up after eating, but I can't complain about the two extra napkins and several ways of cleaning my fingers that accompanied my ribs.    My friend let them know we were celebrating the 17th anniversary of my 39th birthday so they served me a free desert.  I can assure you the pecan pie is a delight!  Warm and laced with brandy, it was perfect way to finish our dinner.  The stockyards, I might mention, is not inexpensive, but what an enjoyable way to spend your money. They do offer two dinner specials you won't find at most other places.  They do have a luncheon menu that has lower prices.   Don't expect chrome and music that is a bit to loud as many of the new places offer.  Instead, just enjoy a time and place where they pamper you as you should be when you go to the Stockyards.  I don't consider the stockyards to be a place you where shorts and Nike's, but of course there are always a few.  I would say a nice shirt and slacks at least.

I remember the first time going into the Elephant Bar and thinking the has to extensive a menu.  For me that is usually a sign that overall the food is not going to be consisten, just to much  of a variety.  My compliments to the chef, I have never had anything that hasn't been quite good.  That is saying something as I over all over the menu.  My dining companion has looked at what at my entree more than once and said "you are going to eat that?"  The ambience of the Elephant Bar is rather nice as well.  Not that you don't see the cutoffs and flip flop crowd but it is some place that one can enjoy dressing a bit for a nicer casual dinner.    The only drawback of the Elephant Bar is the service.  As a whole it is usually very good but occasionally you do get a zinger.  To the management's credit, those people usually don't last.

I have only been to Chompies once.  The waitress recommended sharing a corned (spelled right, I guess) beef sandwich which she said would be big enough for two.  She wasn't kidding.  What truly impressed me was the beef.  It was not to salty and no pieces that you had to hod your napkin up and spit out.  Those are the reasons I never have this kind of sandwich.  Just great beef with the right kind of condiments in my opinion.  When we got the bill I was holding my breath.  What would it cost when the beef was in my opinion excellent.  My surprise at how reasonable the cost was.  Now I have to make a point of getting back there.  I like good potato pancakes.  If they are as good as what I had today, I'll be one happy camper!

My friend, Norma, was refered to Az Joint and Specialists when she fell and injured her shoulder.  The got her in promptly on an emergency basis which I very much appreciated.  Michael Pappas MD has given her excellent care so I am able to recommend his services.  They are well equipped for what they do as a whole.  I will make one suggestion.  Either make a very early appointment or get the first one after they get back from lunch.  I doubt if you have to ask why but I will tell you anyway.  If you don't, plan on having quite a wait to see the Doctor and don't be surprised if it is over an hour.  I don't mind a reasonable wait but 90 minutes is quite a wait when you are with a 91 year old with Alzheimers.  But then again, a wait of an hour and a half on average, I believe is to long for anyone.  I really debated between three and four stars.  I had three but Pappas really does a good job so the four is for him.  Just make sure what time you get an appointment.

I did not expect much from the Macaroni Grill and was surprised.  Nice ambiance, good service, and food that as a whole better than I expected.  One often finds restaurants like this that as a whole look great but on the whole really aren't much more than a glorified Denny's.   That's not so bad if you are at Deny's but the Macaroni Grill's location and prices are such that they should be a more than a  bit different.

I've heard great things about the beatitudes.  However, trying to get a friend placed there has been less than a pleasant experience.    There is a real problem with communication when it comes to finding out what the situation is when it comes to the staff at the Beatitudes.  It finally took a phone call from another nursing facility to find out they were not going to accept my friend.  I have to wonder why they couldn't have told me directly. There were other places I could have been investigating and would have sooner.   Also, when they decide to not accept a person they immediately destroy all the paperwork involved so don't expect to get any reason why.  This is information that could help a person with other placement.  I ended up in the hospital on Thanksgiving.  While I was waiting for an MRI at 4 in the morning, I got to talking to the technician.  I mentioned having a friend who is in assisted living and how I was trying to place her someplace permanently.  I asked her directly what it was like when it came to bringing in residents from the Beatitudes for testing.  Ever seen a person ready to scream when they want to and can't.  There was complete silence for about a minute.   The person told me that he/she could be fired for what he/she was going to tell me but she did not care.  If a patient was scheduled from the beatitudes for testing it was common knowledge that they might or might not arrive at the proper time. When the technician would finally have to call the Beatitudes concerning the person who hadn't arrive, one got the very clear impression that if the person got there or not was really of no great importance.  As I said before, I had heard great things about the Beatitudes.  This was my experience.

I considered having a piercing done.  I had heard Halo was a good place for it.  I went in and discussed what I wanted done and the ramifications.  They were very clear about how long I'd have to stop doing any heavy duty hiking or mountains until it healed.  I was not willing to give that up for as long as they said.  There was no pressure to do it after that.  I appreciated their attitude.

I walked in to Charlies once to meet a friend wearing a suit and tie.  The bartender immediately half screamed/half moaned, "Does anyone around hear wear cowboy boots?"  It could have been a friendly joke type of thing but It wasn't. I didn't appreciate it to say the least.  If I had had cowboy boots on, and I own quite a few, he might have ended up with them hanging from his ears that day.  I wasn't happy about being there anyway.  It had been a long day! I spoke with the owner of the bar.  A few days later,  from what I was told by someone who works there, I could be sure that guy would never do anything like that again.  If you have a problem there, talk to the owner.  He will handle it for you if he knows about it.  I should say I rarely go to this place, but people know have always had great things to say about it.  They have remodeled and it seems to have a nice lay out,  I like the patio and volleyball court..  I rarely go out to bar so can't say to much more than that.

This is a nice little store-a hidden gem so to speak.  The owners used to be customers of mine so I know they have good taste on a personal basis and that they are nice people.  They were also my customers when I did volunteer work for a store nearby.  That was when I started going into their store for my needs and haven't been disappointed.  I like the attitude of these people when you go in their store.  They have a nice inventory and are not taken a back if you don't find what you are looking for.  If they can''t order it, they are just as likely to tell you where you might find it.  They now the quality of the gems and are up front about it wanting you to feel informed about what you are doing.  I can recommend C& G Jewelers to this novice or the experienced buyer.  They will treat you with the same respect.  You will not feel pushed to buy, in fact quite the opposite.  When YOU are ready, then so are they.  They have experience on their side and use it to your advantage.    I am not giving a price range,  There merchandise is priced a appropriately for the quality you want to buy.

This review is going to speak to the ER at St. Joes for the most part.  Some people would say that I am unlucky that I have spent as much time there as I have.  I actually consider myself myself fortunate to have some place to go that seems able to handle unusual situations from what can occur with a an 89 year old lady with Alzheimers to what happens when you fall of a "small" cliff and land on your wrist to most recently what happens when you lacerate the bottom of your foot and toes when you step on the glass of a broken candle.  I won't tell you I have always been happy with the amount of time I have had to wait some times.  I haven't always been thrilled with the staff.  I can say when push comes to shove, these people really now how to handle an emergency and that includes as a trauma patient after a drive by shooting.  They are excellent in evaluating situations and dealing with them accordingly.  I have spent more than the average time around the medical community so I base this statement on experience  Hope you never need their services but if you do St. Joes ER is one of the best..

This is a review about a store that caters to a very specific crowd-those who do ceramics.   I am going to have a one man ceramics show at an art gallery in a few months so I can't tell you how important having a good source of products in that area is to me.  Marjon doesn't have everything but what they don't have I find I probably can work around it with their help..  The people at Marjon Ceramics always make an effort to have answers to my sometimes complicated and often ignorant questions.  I recommend them highly for what they offer.

I hobbled in to Marjon's on my crutches this week and can report no change in the great service and inventory they have to offer.  I found out they are about the only store in the area that offers what they do.  They had a competitor that isn't around any longer.  I think that's important to know.  I've been in stores where if you don't like it to bad because you almost have to go there and put up with whatever-NOT Marjon's.   Also, I have to say that the service they give on the phone is equally pleasant.  They are really one of my backups for my art work which is getting more involved.  One that seems they wlll always treat you right.  Good people here.

Going to Harbor Freight, for me, is like going to the Home Depot of tools.  I will confess to you that if I was looking for really good tools, I wouldn't buy them here.  But for what they offer, their merchandise is pretty good.  I particularly like this store and the 32nd st and Thomas store.  They are always willing to help me find whatever I need and usually more.    I discovered today that in the back corner of each store, they have a clearance section.  That is always worth a look for things you don't need.

What is as good as it gets when it comes to permanent care for a loved one with Alzheimer's?  I'm not sure but Huger Mercy Living Center, part of the St Joseph's Hospital chain, has to come close to it.    The goal of Huger Mercy is to allow the residents to remain as active and independent as possible and to maintain their dignity while living with this disease. They also provide exceptional medical services.  When it came time for me to admit I could no longer care for my 90 year old friend at home, this was essential for me.  I don't know what my expectations are for the future, but I have less fear for her care than I ever thought I would.  I especially appreciate one thing.  Family is encouraged to come visit any time 24 hours a day.  I've never been disappointed in what I have found and believe me, I have shown up at some odd hours.  No one wants to ever have to deal with this.  Most people don't even want to think about it.  If the time ever comes that you do,  I recommend you check out this facility.  From the setting of five acres of trees and grass and flowers to the residents to the staff, to the families you meet when you visit, It gives a feeling of home.  If this is where someone will be spending the last years of their lives with an awful disease like Alzheimer's, what more can one ask.  I want to end this on a happy note,  Huger mercy has four cottages for 12 residents each.  As the resident's mental state deteriorates, they are moved to another cottage.  Each residence is exactly the same to prevent as much confusion in transition as possible.  My friend was going to go into the first residence of the highest functioning resident's.  I had been there some months earlier to take a look, but wanted to see it again when it came time to place Norma there.  We went over there and it was locked with nobody there.  It was an outing day, they'd all gone out for lunch that day.  I know the restaurant they went to and like it myself!  Next week I understand it's out to Scottsdale to a place I've never been.   I may ask them if I can go along!

Sadly I tell you that I moved my friend away from Huger.  It is really a matter of what works for the individual and this wasn't the correct place for Norma.  They don't provide some of the amenities which are essential for her such as having a private bathroom for each room;  also, a nicer dining area and great room.  I also think they just didn't have enough outside activities for her.  Huger was not the right place for my friend.  Doesn't mean its bad just health care in any case is such an individual thing.   It is no different for dementia care.

A friend took me to dinner for my birthday at this location this week.  The food was great.  I rarely eat ribs, but think they have some of the best here.  The meat falls of the bone.  The sauce is just about right, tangy but not to strong.  A plus to the bartender as well, he knows how to mix a good ginger ale.  I want to recommend Rachel,our server, to anyone who goes to this location.  Here is a young woman who really knows how to do her job.  The service she provides is acceptable in every way so I can't complain.  She also did something very special that proves she really listens to her customers when she does her job.  My friend I went to dinner with is 91 with Alzheimer's.  With this illness, this could be our last time she gets to celebrate my birthday with me so it really was important to me that things went well.  She let Rachael know that for my birthday she wanted a cake served with a candle.  I tried to explain to my friend, Norma, that they didn't do that at this restaurant which I know disappointed her but what could I say.  After finishing a full rack of ribs,  I could use the excuse that I was to full to have a desert so could get around the cake and candle situation.  At this point Rachael asked me if I was ready for my birthday desert and expressed that she thought I'd really enjoy it and she gave Norma a big smile so I said fine.  I couldn't believe it when she came out with a scoop of ice cream with a candle in it.  This delighted Norma and touched my heart as Norma sang Happy Birthday" to me.  This is service ask for Rachael!  She get's five stars!  There is only one thing I could suggest that would improve my experience at Outback.  I think the bring out the entree a bit sooner than I would like after the salad is served.  A little more time in between would be nice.

This gym stands out for me because they have a really large outdoor lap pool.  I don't know of any place else that offers that.  It's an older location and not as fancy as the rest so I don't always work out there.  But for swimming three or four days a week, you can't beat a pool where you aren't overwhelmed by the smell of chlorine which seems to be a regular situation with an indoor pool.   It's also nice for cold weather swimming.  If you swim laps like I do, you don't really notice it as being all that cold when you get out. There are a core group of swimmers at this location that really make you feel welcome.  These are a really nice group of people who are serious about their swimming.  The worst thing that has happened to me at this gym was when a young lady put her towel down to take some sun near the end of the lap where I was swimming.  She was quite large and wearing a string bikini.  Each time I came up to to make a turn,  I saw the bottom of her feet and her naked backside,   It was not a flattering sight.

I have been there visiting my friend whose been at Coronado for almost four months,  Overall she has pretty good things to say about this facility.  I've always seen that it is clean and organized.  they seem to answer her questions pretty well and if I am there will respond to me as well with no issues.    Her major complaint is the food.  This is almost always the major complaint any health care facility.  When I have eaten with her, some days the food is better than others, so I can't disagree with her on that.

I go to Tiffany & Company because they keep in stock something that I can't find anywhere else and that is Tiffany cologne for Men.  Quite frankly, I don't want to have think about whether I smell spicy, woodsy, or one of fifty other things. This cologne has a what I consider a unique scent.  It is masculine without having to prove it is anything else.   It is appropriate to wear for any occasion and I never feel like I am going to knock people over with the smell of it.   I like Tiffany for Men and that's all I need.

Maybe I am a Western wear snob but as far as I am concerned if you are looking for real Western wear, you go to Saba's.  They have been around as long as dirt and won't be gone any time soon.  Quality is why any store stays around for any length of time and Saba's has it.   The staff is always very knowledgeable and provide the same kind of service.  I have found when I am shopping for any type of Western wear if they don't have it, what I might find elsewhere usually is going to disappoint me.  I just start at Saba's.    In Scottsdale, Saba's has two stores across the street from each other.  One is clothes and boots.  The other has only boots.  This is boot nirvana!  Don't miss it!   Now the question of prices must be addressed.  They are from moderate to pricey. When you see what they have to offer, this comment will make sense.  You CAN spend money there but what a way to do it!

I finally got to this place. The people who took me there raved about the place and are regulars.  Very interesting building-check it out if you go. Nice crowd but not to busy.  Interesting menu. Food was good but nothing exceptional.  The most noticeable thing about eating there was the complete lack of enthusiasm/interest on our server's part.  I thought being on a college campus, the person serving us might been upbeat and cheerful?  Not so. Even when I asked for a take out box, the server sat it down by my plate and walked off without a word.    Maybe if I'd had more than a few beers, I'd have appreciated this place more. There is a real variety of places to go to in Tempe so why go back.  Going back to Four Peaks kind of reminds me of the old expression-buy me another drink,  your still ugly.  The server wasn't buying.

I won't go back to Richardson's or Dick's Hideaway because of the attitude of the owner. The man is not a nice person and don't let him ever hear you say anything negative, period.  JJ G. says not to get comfortable.  The staff is better about not making sure you are on your way as soon as your finished than it used to be.  Abu J received an email from the owner telling him he is a "loser and a moron" when he reviewed the adjoining Dick's Hideaway, in a way he (the owner) didn't like.  I won't support this man by going back to his establishment.  I should tell you a plus about Richardson's.  Since they passed the law about no smoking in restaurants, you can know smell the food.  It used to be you were hit by a wall of stale cigarette smoke. Anything you wore in there had to be washed when you left it was so bad.  If you like New Mexico style mexican food, the place isn't to bad.  But why would I support a man...well, I could tell you having lived in the neighborhood quite a number of years..  Suffice it to say there are other places to go (and I'm sure they'd have better parking).  I fully expect a hateful email from the owner.  When I get it, I'll post it..

Zia's is a good hang out place in Phoenix, Tempe, etc., and has been for years.  You certainly can't get bored there.  They have vinyl, cassettes, VHS,  DVD's, magazines, etc,  You name it, they have it.  Looking at them,  you honestly wouldn't expect to find the staff is surprisingly well informed.  I'm comfortable asking about just about anything domestic or foreign.  You can get some really good buys on a multitude of things, including the really cheap, because everything is used..  It is one of those you need to be ready to do a little looking places but the prices and variety make it worth it.  I never walk out of there without at least something.  My friend who is 91 with Alzheimer's loves Zia's.  She says it is the best people watching place in town, much better than Bookman's.  The funkier the better for her and you do see them at Zia's.

This store reminds me of what Zia's was most like originally.  It's funky in a kind of college town type of mentality.  They have never been  cheap. They have a really interesting selection of used whatever.  Truly there is something for anyone who might come in off the street-CD's, magazines, DVD's, videos....  The service is surprisingly good and I always appreciate that.  I never get the" you have gray hair and are old" attitude.  To give you an idea of why I appreciate this store in particular was what happened when I was shopping there.  There was a college age guy waiting in front of me waiting to pay.  Out of nowhere his friend ran up and pulled his pants to the ground.  Ever hear of the word commando?  The guy who at this point was blushing just slightly lighter than a red light, grabbed them and pulled them up.  His girlfriend was laughing so hard I thought she was going to choke.  He then paid and the three of them left all laughing.  Standing behind me, a man my age-50's-thought what had happened was shocking.  I just smiled.   I was at the Zia's just off campus in Tempe.  I graduated from ASU.  I've seen worse.

First I have to say I prefer Camelback to Piestawa.   You have to do some real climbing-not like the other one which is kind of like a almost paved path until the last few hundred feet.  Of course, I am one of those crazy people that likes to run as much as I can when going up Camelback.  The views are beautiful from wherever you are on the trail so if you don't make it to the top it is still well worth going at least part way up.  I wish the parking situation was better but you can't have everything.

I hadn't been here to Chelsea's for awhile.  I didn't realize it had become such a meeting place with the weather so nice and their huge patio.  Their service was better than good and can't complain about the food and there was plenty of it.  For some reason wasn't thrilled with the place today.  Maybe just my attitude.  I will go back.

These people have gone out of their way to help me get unique breads. I can call a day or two in advance and they will have what I want waiting.  They have suggested breads I had no idea are available.  I have been introduced to wonderful flavors from delightful combinations of ingredients I didn't know were available.   Their regular retail location is the Roosevelt store.  They always have more of a variety available there.  They also have a location at 40th St and Campbell where they produce a lot of the bread.  I usually order in advance so I use the 40th St location.  I wish they had a slicing machine there but the people at La Grand Orange have also been good about doing it for me.  I don't know if Roosevelt has one.   They are more expensive than your average grocery store.  I don't mind paying for quality and that is what you get here. However, II do think they are reasonable in their pricing.    It took time for me to find the Roosevelt location the first time. Parking in front of the 40th st location is at a premium.  You can save time if you just park in the back.

I have often driven by this place and have noticed one rarely sees cars in the parking lot.  I understand why after my first and last visit. The abrasive attitude of one of the owners is intolerable.  You had better agree with her way of thinking.  Disagree with her and one might make her happy by slitting one wrists and bleeding to death in front of her.  Whether that would be enough might be questionable.

This is a an example of where I had such a bad experience that I can't imagine ever going in the front door of a place ever again.  I went back to see how many years it's been since I had been in there.  After this amount of time you'd think I would have but such is not the case.

What a delight this restaurant is!  A big first is that while it was crowded while we were there, it was still fairly quiet.  A few tables over us, a couple had a baby that didn't look to happy.  At a moment like that I considered asking if we might move to a table on the other side of the restaurant but was it worth the bother?  The decor is what you might find on a piazza of an Italian village. I can tell you at Concia Tagliana somewhere in the walls and ceiling which are festooned with trellises and leaves and strings of lights is some mean soundproofing.  I rarely ever hear the little rug rat!    The service was excellent.  My friend uses a wheel chair when we go distances.  Not only did someone offer to hold the door as we came in, the hostess offered to take the wheel chair in a back room as soon as we were seated without my asking.  A little thing but really appreciated.  We were seated next to a couple that were finishing their dinners.  They told us they had been coming there for years. Their meals looks so good that we just ordered what they had-no need to look at a menu.  Norma's salmon was to her satisfaction which is saying something. She's particular about food and one doesn't hear the word's very good from her that often.  I had eggplant parmesagn which was fixed as well as I could ask for.  When they served these, they were at a temperature where we culd start eating them immediately.  The fact that the manager brought them out, himself, tells me there were not going to sit and get cold.  No, the food was like poison and such small portions, here.  There was more than enough food to have it boxed up for another meal at home.Kari, our waitress, who did an excellent job not only boxed everything up, but put the salads and the entrees in seperate containers, wrote what was in it and whose it was.  To make it even better they were bagged when she brought them out!  That  quality of service really stands out for me..  I am happy to say that reviewing this restaurant gives me a perfect platform to discuss some of my pet peeves.  The first is the size of the  they glasses they use for water and soft drinks.  We live in Arizona where it is HOT in the summers.  More than a few restaurants use glasses that as soon as you sit down and quench your immediate thirst, they have to be filled up again.  My kingdom for a decent size glass of water for a change.  Cucina Tagliani gives you large bordering on huge glasses of what ever you order.  Our server didn't even have to think about refilling the glasses, her concern could be with getting the meal served proper.  This alone would be good for half a a star from me.  My second pet peeve started flashing red lights for me when Kari said we could have a salad to go with our meal for ninety nine cents.  When I hear that I immediately envision a salad of size that would have to go past a mirror twice to get a reflection.  Norma likes a salad. though, so for that price I said let's do it-against my better judgment.  I was shocked when she brought out two salads that were large, fresh and inviting!  Even by the size of the regular dinner salads one sees at most places, these were generous.  This was good for a star just on his own.  My third pet peeve is the "complimentary bread" that gets served, especially at an Italian eatery.  Usually there is an end piece that looks like are risking your bridge work if you bite down on it.  Aside from that, the rest will be ok but not something to write home.  We won't even talk about the fact that it almost always takes two baskets to be sufficient. It's a given that another one will have to be requested. Here the three slices of bread were light and fresh, no ends,  perfect to dip in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar you tke out of the basket on the table to mix on the extra plate set for that at the table.  About the time I was ready to request a second basket, what was delivered but another basket of bread as nice as the third.  I like this place.  I will share a final moment of horror that occurred for me at Cocina Tagliana when we requested our check.  We never looked at the menus which also mean we never looked at the prices.  Based on the quality of the food, the large servings, and the really good service, I was questioning whether I was going to have to sell  my first born, if I had one, to pay for the meal.  My last pleasant surprise was how reasonable the amount of the check was!  In addition to that, a short survey was attached to the check.  They asked some questions I would want to know if it was my establishment.   It is obvious they are concerned about staying above what is just sufficient.  It is working!  Before I make Cucina Tagliani sound like an Italian eatery Nirvana,  let me say one thing,  I have had better Italian food at higher prices in more sophisticated establishments..  So many things come together right here that for a neighborhood eatery, I don't think I could have asked for much better..

The other night was my first visit to this gem!  My first thought as I came in the door was how good the food smelled!  It is small and you are served at long tables or at the bar.  Part of it's charm is you never know who you might be seated with.  Seating might be a bit tight but it isn't bad. I am also surprised it isn't noisier for as small and compact as it. The food and the way it is served is what you'd expect to fin in Spain.  You get exactly what you order so it is fun to choose what you want as you put together your choice of a meal  The servings are not large but are well appointed with excellent sauces.  Visually they are a delight just to have put before you.  Maggie, our server, provided flawless service.  She knew the menu and made excellent suggestions concerning the food. It will be a great place to take a group of friends for a relaxed, excellent meal.  My potato tart was lite and the eggplant and the way it was served was as good as I can remember having.  I give the restaurant five stars for being unique and fun with and having what excellent food!  If you have to wait,  just the smell of the food as you walk in the door will tell you it is worth it.

I questioned whether to rate this five stars.  But in all honesty I haven't been there as many times as Jamba Juice across the street which squeaks by with one star.  So, I try to be fair.  Robeks has smoothies that are really rich with a great flavors.  Their side orders are well presented and are most tempting.  The store is really nice and you don't walk out of the place have deaf if they are busy.  The employees have always been really courteous to me and my friend.  They have yet to foul up my order!   In addition the parking is plentiful.   I enjoy going in this place.   (see my review of Jamba Juice-gag-and my comments will make more sense.

This is one of my favorite two places to get groceries.  The store is so easy to shop at.  Who ever planned it deserves a medal.  It is big without being intimidating.  Each area of the store is well stocked, including the nice big specialty section. The staff is as accommodating as one could ever ask for.  You are likely to be asked if you are needing help several times, regularly, when you shop in this store.  Even in the specialty areas, which can be the downfall of a good store, this attitude is carried through.  I can't really thing of anything to criticize.  This Safeway is that good.   I'll share with you something you might miss.  Back by the dairy, by the swinging doors,  there are a few shelves of mark downs.  It never hurts to take a look for those things you might buy if the prices were lower.  It gives you that chance to find out if they are worth the higher or price or not.  Other things may not be exotic, some you might never buy, but it's worth a look!  One note concerning shopping at this store during rush hour.  Try to a make a left turn on to Glendale and you can anticipate a long wait.  You might want to consider what I do.   Go around the back of the store, make a left on to 7th street, then you get in to the turn lane for Glendale.   It's easier on the nerves.

I am so glad to be writing this review about a wonderful place.  The only thing I regret is that I can only give Valley Endodontic Speciallty Group five stars.  I would give them ten stars the ultimate!  I have bad teeth.  Dr. Tonioli has done all my root canals.  I have heard so many horror stories about having root canals that I am puzzled.  I have never had any real discomfort.  Perhaps having a front desk that makes you so comfortable to begin with.  They explain exactly what you can expect.  Maybe it's the sun glasses they put on you so you don't have that very bright light giving you a headache.  Maybe it's that they give you enough pain killers that you have no pain.  I don't mind being numb for awhile after the procedure.  Better than have them stop being effective during the work that is being done.  Whatever, they do it right for you.  Funny story.  I have had dentists over the years I wouldn't send my dog do to.  I can be choosy and I am.  Years ago I had my first root canal done by Dr. Tonioli.   it was a a very positive experience.  (Can you believe anyone would say that about a root canal?!?)  When I had to have the latest (plural) done,  I drove by the old office to see if I could get Dr. Tonioli to do them.  The office was no longer there and I didn't remember the name of the group he worked with.  When I called the group my insurance recommended, in passing I said I had had this wonderful Dr Tonioli do the work years ago and don't be offended but I wish I knew where he was so he could do it again.  The receptionist laughed and said he was at their central Phoenix location, so why not call there!!!  I've heard Dr. Axx, his associate, is great as well.  Frankly, Dr. Tonioli is my guy.

Recently I rented from this location of U Haul.   There was some confusion among the employees as to what vehicles have what kind of ramps, meaning I had to return a vehicle for another, so can't give them five stars as a whole.  I do want to give Sean McGiven, the mgr,  five stars for his part.  He went out of his way to make it a great experience for me, not charging me for something that had to be done when he had every right to do so.  Thank you, Mr. McGiven.  Would I go back to this location, definitely.  They may not be perfect when it comes to staff, but the manager makes it worthwhile to do so.  He's working at correcting the little mistakes that can happen.  I don't think it is out of line to double check that the equipment you need-special type of ramp, in my case-is on what you rent before you take it out..

I have some wonderful news which probably most people won't care about but that is beside the point.  I'm happy about it.  This BAC branch is nearest to my home.  It is convenient so you'd think I would go in there most often when I need to do more than use the ATM.  WRONG!  Over the past few years the customer service has been a reflection of a string of branch managers who didn't seem appropriate to be in that position. I will share two examples with you.   One made you just not want to go in there, period, due to the charm she did not exude.   Another was nice enough but didn't seem to be really capable of doing the job. There other employees had to work with these people and some of them came with them it seemed, which made it worse.  I hold my bank to a higher standard as it is handling my money for me.  As a result, I guess I have higher expectations when I walk in the door as opposed to other businesses.  Today, I either left my wallet at a restaurant that was closed before I could get back there lost it, or had it stolen.  When I discovered this, I realized that if I was going to get there before closing, I had to got to 20th St and Camelback.  If I hadn't felt I should have a temporary debit card to use in case of an emergency, I would have waited until the next day and gone else where.  Before I walked in the door, I reminded myself that as usual I'd better expect a long wait as was the case for even the most minor of things at this branch, among other things.  It was a relief when a young gentleman, Christ Berry, a personal banker, who seemed to be better capable of giving customer service in the past was available to help me.  As we went through the process of doing what was necessary, Chris actually seemed happy and relaxed in what he was doing.  Another personal banker whose name I don't know was actually smiling when she came over to get something next to where I was sitting.  I finally told Chris that I usually dreaded coming in that branch because of the attitude that usually prevailed and how long things always took.  He asked me how long since I'd been in and went on to tell me that they had a new manager.   She'd been making some changes and customers seemed happy about it.  I couldn't argue.  He said he'd to like me to meet the new manager who turned out to be an assistant from one of the branches that I'd much prefer to go to.  Her name is Shaleen Scott who has been promoted from assistant at one of the branches I much prefer to go to.  She even recognized me even though we hadn't had that much actual personal contact.  She straightened out a problem caused by the bank itself one day and couldn't have been more gracious in the way she did it, one day so I recognized her immediately.  she also was pleasant enough to always take a moment to say hello when she say me in the future.   The moral of the story is this.  It is a pretty safe to say if you aren't happy with your branch, try this one.  I'll be going back.  When it involves my finances, this is the kind of attitude I like to see.  After they closed the branch in Fry's across the street I was bummed  For as small as it was, I always felt appreciated there and could get things done promptly.   I felt this same attitude today so guess I can start using this branch again regularly.  What a relief!  Minor plus to all of this.  With the cost of gas, closer is always better!

Linen's Plus, the store that was perfect for me closed.  The staff here has gone out it's way to accommodate me and I appreciate it.  It's a smaller store and they have been out of things I am looking for.  They have always offered to have things sent in for me or at least find it in another store so I can pick it up that day if I need it.   Since I lost the store where I shopped enough that the magnetic strip was worn off my credit card, I have discovered Bed,  Bath,  and Beyond, does carry a wider range of products than I would have known otherwise.  The staff is for the most part, very knowledgeable about their stock.  A special compliment to this store.  Occasionally I shop for a friend using her Amex card.  This store always checks ID's and if your picture isn't on the card, they won't ring you up!  How often does anyone even check let alone stick to the store policy.

It's been quite a while since I have been in a Jack in the Box where it took as long as to get my order as this location the other night.  I have a sneaking suspicion that people in the restaurant are going to be taken care of after the drive thru is handled.  People that work there are nice enough.  They could spend a little money sprucing this place up.  It's looking a little worse for wear even for a Jack in the Box.

As convenience markets go, this store is one of the better ones.  Generally the employees here have a better attitude and actually show some concern for what they are doing. You see the same employees here, not much of a turnover. The store is clean,  well organized, and rarely is out of anything. You are not likely to be accosted by someone asking for money on the lot.  The only thing your really need to be concerned about is that the outside could have been arranged better.  It is busy so you do have to watch for people coming in and around the gas pumps.  They could have used more room there but you can't have everything.

I rarely go into this branch and I don't know why.  You might consider it more of a business branch and that is fine with me!  I went in on a Friday afternoon near to closing.  There were no lines of people and things were going at a brisk pace.  The employees are always very helpful. Now that I think of it, it has never been overly busing-line wise-anytime I have been in there.  I just wrote a review on my experience with a particularly strange individual I ran into at another business setting.  It's such a pleasure to say something nice instead!  If I had gone into in this branch more, I'd probably have give it five stars.

This store for me is like an old friend.  When my favorite Bashas closed at 16th st. and Bethany Home (Boo Hiss), most of the employees that I had come to know and appreciate came to this store.  It's these people that really make this probably one of my favorite two stores to go for groceries.  They have a core group of employees that take the time to know their customers.  If there is a problem, they take the time to see that it gets corrected on a more personal basis.  How many places does that happen anywhere?  The store itself not the biggest or newest Bashas, but it is right for me.  It's big enough to have more variety than I need and is laid out in a way that make sense.  I think a lot of other people must feel the same because I often see many of the same people shopping their regularly.   This store has a small but well tended produce section. Ion, who has been handles the produce for this store, really stays on top of this area.  If I have any questions about the produce, he is right there to provide any information I need and always is in a pleasant mood.  With some of the questions I've asked this guy over the years, I admire that he doesn't run when he sees me. Yesterday, I went to buy some apples just to eat.  When I said I wanted a kind that are soft to bight into he gave me a rundown on which were the best for that plus which would be sweet or tart as well, something I wouldn't have thought about.   The other plus is the parking lot.  It's laid out in a really convenient way.  The spaces go straight out from the store.  Being not to big, it's simple to find your car. I find it disconcerting to wonder if my frozen things are going to be half thawed just trying to find where I parked.  In Phoenix during the summer, it does make a difference! .

They are finally giving this store the clean up that it needs.  I have always felt like this store kind of stood out like a poor relation compared to other Bashas that I have been in.  I am looking forward to what it will be like when they are done.  The store has some good things already going for it.  The layout is such that that you cam go in and find thins easily.  The parking lot is easy to get in and get out of-not like the nightmare on 16th and Glendale.  What is even better is the staff..  Pat, one of the managers, has been there long enough to be able to handle most situations gracefully.  Ion, in the produce dept, remains a man who really knows his dept!.  Tonight, Shawna was as helpful as always.  I really appreciate it.  I think the remodeling will be good for the overall attitude of the store.  Who wouldn't feel better if their surroundings improve?

I have to start this review with a rather personal comment.  Some years ago, this store underwent a major remodel.  I was having a thing with one of the individuals who was very influential in how things were going to be done.  By the time the thing was over, I had a sneaking suspicion this store was going to be in real trouble.  I was right.  This store is badly organized.  One example of this is the pharmacy area in the center of the store is set at angles completely different from the other two sides of the store.  It is like you have a store separated by the 51 freeway in the middle.  When you get to the frozen foods, the cases have to wind around the pharmacy set up.  Straight lines of freezer cases are not absolutely necessary but do make it easier to figure out what is where.   But since the front of the store curves around at an one point, why should they not.  It's a large store with a lot of merchandise.  This is a real plus if you are willing to search to the far corners for what you need.  Tyler H wasn't kidding when he said confusing.  Another thing is true concerning what Tyler H said about this store.  There are some beautiful specimens to behold as they push their shopping carts.  I just don't want them to be ready for social security by the time they find what they need and leave the store!  One final thought about this store has to with the pharmacy itself.  I found that if I had to describe the attitude of the staff in two words, I would use rude and stupid.  Stupid because there is no way people won't spread the word about how rude they tend to be.  I've asked other people who agree with me.  Maybe it's because they work near the Biltmore, they feel they can act that way?  I certainly hope their attitude has changed.  It makes me happy to tell you this is not the attutude of the rest of the staff.  Usually they are friendly and ready to help.  I originally gave this store 3 stars but changed it to 2.  Any store I avoid shopping at unless absolutely necessary seems deserving of less than a three.

At the gallery, I heard a friend talking about the fact she was going to be singing with a band that night.  She said people I knew were all gathering there to her her sing.  I asked if I could going them so she gave me the name and address of the bar.  I really enjoy these people but the idea of going to a bar?  Not my way I want to spend a relaxing evening with friends.  However, I had asked if I could join them so thought I'd better go.  This is a case of where I should have read what reviews I could find on Yelp because Karen L's review really gets it right.   It's kind of a bar, lounge, restaurant all combined in one.  The atmosphere is as welcoming to a stranger than any place I have been for a long time. There is a real cultural mix which I found to be very inviting.  It's not a tony place. It's neighbourhood and happily open to anyone who might walk in the door.  I sat at a long table with friends including their two ten year olds.  Kind of fun for all.  The food...I didn't know they served food but they have a menu that  I am sure most could find something to order from.  I tried the rib tips which a certain female friend recommended.  I rarely eat beef and BBQ so can't say I have much to compare with what I ate.  It had a distinct flavor and the meet was tender.  I couldn't complain.  I saw a person having a burger and fries that really looked good but as I said based on the recommendation from that particular individual...   The music was a mix by a small group from the 40's up.  It was a little loud but for a room full of friends having a good time, that was fine.  I enjoyed hearing them and listening to my friend sing.  From what I could see, a good time was had by all.  As I said before, don't do for the style, go for the fun.  I'm not sure when the band played so if you go there for that, call ahead.

Nice place to go for casual Greek.   The people couldn't have been more friendly and the menu easy to read.  With all the restaurants in the area and in the city, personable employees can make the difference as to whether I'll go back to a place.  I can't say I was thrilled with the spanakopita platter, the main dish being a little to "fried" for my taste.  The rest was great,  good flavor and texture, can't complain, so after once I can comfortably say I'm a fan...  I am going to go back and try the gyro or something else.  That dish looked tempting as I saw it being served to others.  i'd suggest trying this restaurant.

I have to say I had probably one of the best dining experiences of my life the other day when we went for lunch at Aiello's and for a reasonable price as well.  I was quite surprised to say the least.  The location would not lead you to think you'd be in a setting surrounded by greenery but it is once you go inside.  To be greeted as nicely as we were is another thing.  The regular waitress had an emergency so we learned later that our server was the owners wife.  I don't know when I've be taken through a room set as nicely as there.  The white table clothes, the colored napkins, all gave a sense of being in harmony.  Another thing that rarely happens in Phoenix, she placed our napkins for us!  This happens on the coast, maybe, San Francisco or in Dallas, but in Phoenix?  My feeling of Aiello's is of one of those restaurants that happens when culture has reached a point it is right for the moment.  Our city has grown to the point that places like this should start happening.  They are long overdue!  We had two pasta dishes-angel hair pasta with meatballs, and I can't remember the type of pasta with wild mushrooms and shallots. Each was served uniquely, not like what you expect and are served at one of the chain restaurants.  The sauces are delectable-just the right consistency and flavors to be savored!  The presentation is one that you expect from a chef.  When the dishes are served properly, to my way of thinking, they draw your eye to the of colors and textures. What a delight for this to occur here with each course of our meals!  I am looking forward to going back to see what else he can do with other selections on the menu.   (I just really like to write a review like this!  Let me continue!)  This is also a restaurant where you must plan on having desserts),  I rarely do as am on a perpetual "stay the weight I want to be diet."  Here they are so good, I helped to eat one and finished another.  At the time we were there, they were photographing a table set with desserts.  Imagine my surprise when we were asked if we'd like to have the desserts that had just been photographed courtesy of Aiello's.  They were wonderful!  I felt like the fatted calf when we left and it was worth every calorie to enjoy them!  If one is going to indulge, you might as well do it at Aiello's.  Probably the greatest compliment this restaurant could receive was when my dining companion said "let's sit for while" when we were finished.  She has traveled the world over and has dined extensively.  I felt the same, it was a great experience and while let it end!  I had this established recommended to me while having keys cut at the hardware store, hardly the best place to get a recommendation.  Also, the same individual roared off on a motorcycle, not another reason for me to think that much about said recommendation.  However, this fellow seemed so truly taken with Aiello's that we went there in spite of misgivings.  Speaking of misgivings, I didn't say when we got there, we were the only people in the establishment.  For me, this means the red flags go up immediately.  Why is it empty?  I knew two and maybe three places had failed in this location before, another not good sign.  I truly had to resist the urge to suggest leaving.  I am so pleased that we didn't.  We'd have missed this diamond hidden on Central above Camelback road,  One comment concerning casual dressing at Aiello's.  I would be perfectly comfortable wearing slacks or a tuxedo dining here.  At lunch I might wear jeans.  I don't see Aiello's for being a cut offs and t shirt type of place.  There are enough places you can do that.  Appreciate Aiello's for what it is worth and dress the part is my suggestion.

I really like this location of Fresh & Easy.  It is always clean and laid out in a way that makes sense to me.  The produce is fresh which is important to me.  Overall the prices are really moderate. If you go the correct time in the late afternoon a person can find some great markdowns on fresh items! The employees really go out of their way to make it pleasant to shop there.  I don't know about the rest of there stores but I'm glad this one is in my neighborhood.

I stopped in there to try the daily special-two slices of cheese pizza and a can of Spring Mist out of the cooler for $4.  I was surprised how large the slices are and how much cheese there is on them.  I won't say I haven't had better "gourmet"  pizza but when I did, it cost twice as much.  If you just want good old fashioned pizza, this is a place to go.  I do intend to try other things on the menu the next time I go there.  Some of the descriptions of the food in other reviews sound interesting.  The location is a little strange but I can give you a tip that will make it much easier to get there. I'd tried to stop in their more than once but because of the traffic on Indian School and having to know exactly where to turn in, I didn't make it. if you turn right on 7th Street off of Indian School ( North), there is a gas station and then a Jack in the Box.  If you go through the parking lot right between them and across the alley,  it will take you right into Momma Mia's parking lot.  Makes it so much easier to get out when you leave.  Better than trying to get on to Indian School when traffic is bumper to bumper traffic on  Indian school road for three blocks.  The guy who makes the pizza, Tony, is a character. I think has to be one of the owners.  His main goal is to make the food and he's good at it.  Definitely, a neighborhood place, he's perfect for it.  He will tell you he's had problems in the past with checks so he doesn't take them.. In my case while he was putting a pizza in the oven..  He does take every major credit card  including  American Express.  That surprised me for such a small place.

I have, over the years, bought hundreds of tires from this location for both personal and company truck use.  The service is consistant.  They don't make a major effort for you to spend more than is necessary for your needs unlike other places I've been.    The company is also very good about honoring the warranty they sell on their tires with very few questions asked.   I once when in after I had  blown out both  the tires on the left side of my car at once when I swerved to keep from hitting a child.  The tires were two weeks old.  No questions asked, they replaced them for me.  I only had to pay the negligible cost of a new warranty for each tire.  I am also impressed by the fact that you see the same employees here at a later date.  In this industry to keep the same employees over time is quite a fete, I believe.  My only complaint is that during rush hour getting in and out of this location is a challenge.   However, it is a plus that there are some many places you can go if you don't want to have to sit and wait while you get your tire situation resolved.  That's a real plus in itself.  I just suggest going in off hours if you can.

I called Spencer's yesterday for some information concerning a new stove and spoke to Blake.  I was in sales for thirty years so how an individual handles a phone call from me really affects whether i will even go some place.  Blake handled the call as professionally as I could ask for. I worked on commission for many years so if a person is decent on the phone with me, I will always give that person a chance to make a better living by asking for him or her if i decide to go in that store.  I did just that  I went in today.  I did have to wait for him to finish with another customer but it gave me a chance to look around.  Besides, I can remember over the years how many customers waited for me, I gave Blake that same courtesy.  I can tell you, working with Blake was a delight.  I told him exactly what I needed.   He displayed an excellent knowledge of his inventory.  He showed me exactly what was available in my desired price range.  The main question was whether to get a stove with exposed burners or not and was it self cleaning.  He volunteered information that I didn't expect which encouraged me to buy what I didn't plan on-the type without exposed burner's.  I appreciated that as I wasn't considering resale value in the long run.  It certainly didn't hurt that he also found me a model that was less than I expected to pay.  The entire process took less than twenty minutes from beginning to end and they are delivering tomorrow.  If all goes well when the delivery is made tomorrow, I will have to consider going to five stars on this review.  I certainly recommend asking for Blake.   He's knowledgeable and resourceful.  I am totally satisfied by how he handled the situation.  He made no attempt to over sell which I much appreciate.   I can see going back and asking for him with no reservations.  Good man, Blake.  I'd like to say one more thing for this store.    The professionalism that I found with Blake seemed to be a reflection of how the rest of the staff operated.  This is a local company that I think has discovered that quality customer service is what brings success.   Shopping local is not a necessity but I am happy when I can do it.

At the time of the original order, I was charged for some services that were expected to be done.  It turned out some parts I paid for didn't have to be used after all.  When I called Blake about this,  he handled the refund over the phone with no problems. Based on his earlier service, this was what I expected from him.  Good to be able to say this about Blake!

Let me say first that if I could give a lower rating to the way the staff of the Children's Museum of Phoenix treated me,  a 0 or lower would be appropriate.  Unfortunately, I am limited in this respect.  I believe it is appropriate to let a person know that you can't be someplace where you are expected.  In my place I got to where I was expected but wasn't allowed to stay.  It would have been nice if in someway they would have arranged to let the person waiting for me know I had been there.  It does make a difference if where you are makes it very clear that they will make no more than the most minimal effort to help you do that.  That is a how the Children's Museum of Phoenix staff handled my situation.  Obviously I was mistaken when I thought I could pay cash for tickets to the event that Yelpers were invited to at this place tonight.  I discovered when I got there that you HAD to buy your tickets on line ahead of time or else you were out of luck.  My mistake was to think the staff of this place might help me to let somebody from Yelp know that I at least got there if I couldn't stay.  Talk about a group of people that were absolutely unwilling to do more than than the minimum expected of them.  I asked them if they could bring up a Yelp page on a computer so I could explain to someone what had happened.  They were going do nothing of the kind.  The look of shock that I asked was apparent on the faces of a  couple of them!  Based on what happened and their attitude toward me, I told them I wouldn't be back.   One of the women said, "I'm sorry."  I told her she would only need to have said that if she'd been willing to at least bring up a Yelp page for me and left.   Truthfully, It takes a lot to get me to say I won't go back to a place.  In this case...   You might say they were terribly busy and just didn't have time for the simplest of mistakes.  There were enough of them standing around that I was taken from one group to another.  It kind of reminded me of a department store where you walk in and the sales associates are standing around talking rather taking care of customers.  If these people were busy, I'd hate to see them when they weren't...maybe in a coma?

I won't go back to this restaurant.  The food literally made me ill.  It is clean, the decor is good, and the service can't be faulted.  However, I spent all night in the bathroom losing the meal I had there.  How do I know their food caused it? I had a bowl of cereal that morning.  What I lost that was undigested was my meal from True Food's, a clear sign of food poisoning.  I had the teryaki tofu.  My neighbor had salmon and was fine.  I plan to call them tomorrow and notify them of what happened.    My general opinion of the place if I hadn't become ill.  It is a trendy place with an interesting menu. The service was good-I had no complaints.   It was clean and the deco handsome and low key.  I found it  disconcerting that neither of us could easily read the menu due to the dim lights.  I noticed the gentleman at the next table tipping his menu to catch more light while he was trying to read it.  How long it will stay a gathering place for the for the more socially inclined, I question.   Both of us thought for the most part the items on the menu were overpriced.  The restaurant is located at the Biltmore  so I expected the prices to be at least a bit high anyway and they were.     We did have to get a steak knife for my friend to be able to cut the bread her salmon was on. The restrooms were interesting with unique dryers that actually did a complete job of drying the hands.  Added 1/29-I decided to email Sam Fox instead of calling.  No reply as yet. 2/2-It is now the day after the Super Bowl and still no response.   That tells me something about the owner, Sam Fox, and his attitude. When I sent him a compliment on another of his restaurants, I got almost an immediate response.  Not this time!  5/27/09-never heard back.  Negative one star for this one.

This is a case of finding a restaurant through Yelp.  You yelpers came through for me.  Thank you.  Floyd's is just a little place that you can miss if you aren't really watching for it-kind of tucked away next to Sprouts.  It is in my opinion worth it to you to make sure you find it.    We got there just before it started getting crowded.  The value of that is my dining companion  and I had the opportunity to experience the service while our server was having to handle more than one situation.  Speaking of our server, I met certainly can recommend asking for Stephani.  During our meal she definitely had her job cut out for her finding  a sauce that appealed for the shrimp on skewers that my friend had.  No complaints there, she came through with flying colors, during the busy time that we chose to got to Floy'ds.  I was most impressed by how the dishes were served.  Visually, they were a delight before we even picked up a fork! How often does that happen?  This is especially important to me as it's something that I make sure happen whenever I serve a meal at home.  If I can do it at home, I am often disappointed when I don't find the same when I go out.  She had the bacon wrapped shrimp, I had eggplant.  Both were prepared to our satisfaction.  The creme brule made with bananas and strawberry was different but tasty as well.  We will go back.

No matter what anyone has to say about this location of Jack in the Box, I will always have a special fondness for it.  It was put in when I was in my teens.  My Father's corporate offices were nearby.  It was such a delight when they put it in!  I could run across the street and get food that was consistent, hot, and with a decent price. Nobody ever told me not to eat it because it wasn't good for me. I was not well when I was young and I'd eat there because I had to eat something at work.  To this day no matter how sick I am I can put down two tacos and a Jumbo Jack.  I wonder if the grease from the tacos helped build my immune system? I'll go by and check it out.

Lately I find myself dropping in this location of Jack in the Box more often than I have in the past.  It's typical fast food so what can you say.  I can say they are pretty efficient and more friendly than the crews at other locations of this same company.  I like that.  Makes the food go down better when the person providing it makes the day just a little nice by being agreeable.  To bad they have to be by that German place where the people work at trying to be the opposite,

I happen to run into the manager of this store when I was doing some shopping.  He is just such a personable guy even when he is not at work!.  We discussed which furniture he should buy.  The crew is a reflection of his attitude.  Even more of a reason to go to this Jack in the Box.  If he reads this, I hope the table worked out.

I am giving this store two stars because I HAD to be there on a bad day when the newest, untrained, young AT&T employees in the United states were running the store. ( Don't take offense when I use the word, young, all these guys just happened to be.) I am giving them a second star because it CAN"T be that bad all the time.  I will explain.  First of all, I have a cell phone strictly so that a friend can get hold of me in an emergency.  The only other time I use it is to let people know when I am going to be late.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have one.  The idea of someone driving a telephone booth next to me is not appealing, nor does shopping next to someone who is a walking telephone booth.  I don't want to know that much about someones personal life when I am shopping for banana's, or a newspaper, thank you. I am waiting for the day when they make a switch and all cell phones turn off around me unless a call is really important=dead battery, sick kids, the cat is throwing up.  Call me antisocial.  I like my peace and quiet.  The job of deciding whether to buy drain cleaner in a liquid or a gel is enough of a job for me without any interruptions about the mysterious Aunt Martha and her bunions, I guess.   I got my first AT&T phone, free, in a raffle at a community event.  It was the most basic and that is fine with me.  I can't complain.  It did what I want and I have gotten good service from AT&T, nor like the nightmare my friend has had with Verizon.  After three years, the phone still works but decided to upgrade.  I went into this store prepared to buy a phone.  It wouldn't take much more than to put in my hands something basically what I wanted and out comes the Visa.  These people did everything they could to not sell me a phone.  They pointed where the phones were.  I found what I wanted and their weren't any hanging there.  I asked a sales person to go check.  He went in the back and a few minutes later I saw him leaning on the counter chatting with the other employees.  I went over and asked him if they'd had any in the back.  He said no.  He had misunderstood me and thought I'd just was telling him the slot was empty? I then asked if they were getting any in?  He said, "You, mean, you want one?" He asked another employee who said you never know what's coming in.  The silence then was poignant. At that point, I left when they didn't offer to call another store.  Seriously. the service at this store has to be better than what I received.  It can't be that bad.  They are still open.  Me?  I went down the street and found what I wanted.  I won't go back, but honestly, it can't be that bad all that time.  As I said, they are still open..

I can't say this is a store I would normally shop in.  If you are into "dressing up", I think it would be in interesting for men and women, young or old.They certainly are not lacking for inventory.  For just guy things, things can be exotic or just fun.

I have lived in Phoenix long enough to see more than a few gyms come and go.  I am inclined to thins LA fitness is going to last.  I don't see them overselling memberships like some places I've belonged to.  I find it to be clean and spacious. There have been times when it has been ready to be cleaned but I expect that considering the time of day and how many people through there. The machines aren't right on top of each other and neither are the people working out.  If you don't go during the busiest times of the day, there isn't much of a wait.  They have the advantage of having plenty of covered parking which during the summer is really nice.  Of course any place that you can walk around the corner and find stores like Trader Joe's when you are done working out is fine with me.  A gay meat market? I personally am of the opinion that you find what you are looking for.  Yes there are people who are openly gay and openly straight as well.  Live with it and focus on your workout is my attitude.  If I ask someone to spot me, I am far more concerned about whether they can do the job than their sexuality.

I like this store.  Anything that helps children in need is a big drawing card for me.  It's not as big as some stores but the quality is better here.  The prices might be a bit higher as a result but you get what you pay for.  The employees are particularly nice and are really sincere in their thanks when you make a donation there.  They are dedicated to help making life for children who need all the help they can get.  It's easy to feel good about donating here.   The store has plenty of easy parking.  It's easy to get in and out of especially if someone tells you that by going around the back side of the building you can make an easy left or right onto Hghland.

What would I do without Elizabeth and her alterations.  My friend, Norma has been going to her for years.   As far as Norma, is concerned, there isn't anything that Elizabeth can't do and do well.  Based on number of customers she has and what I have seen people bring in, I am inclined to agree.  I also include wedding gowns and the number of delighted brides I have seen being fitted and picking up their gowns.  If you can do thet, well...  What I think makes Elizabeth special is there obvious knowledge of style and fabrics and fit.  I base this opinion on having personally worked with women's fashions for thirty years.    She may not be the cheapest in Phoenix, but in tailoring, you do pay for what you get.  She does do the job right and that makes her services worth what she charges.

First, I was only going to give this store four stars because always being asked for change is annoying.  On second thought, I realize this is part of what makes this store click so it is all the way five.  A consumer needs to know some general things about the 99 Cent Only store chain.  They  really have an amazing variety of stock at nothing more than 99 cents. In some cases, you will find items for less.  (Try regular, or low sodium, V 8 juice for 59 cents a can. When I say they have a variety, I have purchased everything to computer parts to dvd's to cd's to tv antennas to alarm clocks to gift bags of all sizes to different things I have used in volunteer work with Ballet AZ.  They always have special items for the current holiday.  The Anderson Split Pea soup that is $1.47 and up at the grocery stores is 99 cents here and they have different varieties.  I never failed to be surprised when I see individual french milled soaps next to bars of lava soap. They have a gourmet section that incudes things I have absolutely no idea of what they are used for but it's nice to know they are there if i ever need them?. In season, you will find plants that are two dollars less than Bashas has the same size at the time I write this.  I admit to being a shopper so I like just spending time and perusing almost all the shelves.  One of the latest things that really surprised me were boxes of extra large condoms made in colors only!!  Add spice to your sex life in how many different colors?  Now, it is time to figures out why this particular store on Indian School is unique and has the drawing power that it does for me.This is an interesting store.  The one on 12 th street that is just about the same distance to my house, is bigger and it isn't as crowded.  So why do I shop there more?  Is it because it was there first and I am used to it?  Is it because in this store I have run into people who clearly don't want to be seen shopping there-that's a biggie!  Maybe I just like the real diversity in the people that work and shop there.  Not that often do I get to use the smatterings of different languages I know with people who don't any more English than I know of their tongues.  Trying to make known that you need an alarm clock in Swahili is a challenge.  This store is truly an adventure and I love it!  It's not for the faint of heart.  And as I said before, what can be better than listening to the stammering explanation of someone who lives at Scottsdale Ranch and wouldn't  be caught dead in a place like that when you come around a corner and there they are pushing a full shopping cart.  That is as opposed to seeing someone like the dear lady I know who keeps a little winter place at the Biltmore, gushing over what terrific buys they have and being glad to see a friend. The only thing I wish they could change about this store would be to have someone there to keep the panhandlers out of the parking lot.  Even that can be interesting at times.  Someone asked me for change the other day, and the person looked at what I gave her and she told me that I could do better than that, couldn't I?  As she said, a dollar really didn't go as far as it did a year ago with the economy the way it is.  Who was I to argue with that line of thinking.  I gave her more and felt good about this budding economist.  One tip about getting to this store that can save you time.  You don't ever want to make a left turn into it or out of it in rush hour traffic.  Talk about having a death wish?  Instead, go north in the parking lot and make a left and go across the parking lot pass the Arthur Murray Dance studio and out to 12th st.   There another way to go out north but it takes you through neighborhoods full of people and cars.  I am sharing my secret with you.  It is so much easier, this way,

Norma, my 91 year old friend, goes here every Tuesday morning for breakfast with other residents of the care center where she lives.  She has raved about it for the longest time so I finally broke down and went with her.  It had been ages since I gone to a Village Inn restaurant and the thought really didn't appeal to me.  I had no complaints about how the french toast with banana and strawberries was fixed.  They certainly served enough of the toppings that no syrup was necessary-fine with me as the latter is much to sweet for me.  The servers as a whole were just nice-ready to serve a relaxed dinner-no hurrying you to finish.  No, it wasn't a gourmet experience.  I do realize that going to this restaurant took me back to a more carefree time in my life when we'd go out to eat before an evening at a play, maybe dancing, or whatever.  Just hanging out with friends, getting to be a little foolish, and generally having a server that could deal with it.  Maybe I need more of that in my life these days.  I will go back.

This store has something I can rave about and that is excellent service.  I have never been in there where the young female employees haven't really made me want to go back.  That includes helping move furniture so I can get my 91 year old friend with Alzheimers in more easily on the day we use the wheel chair.  I am so grateful for that and want to say publicly, Thank You!  Also, it is easy to get in and out of with convenient parking, handicapped and otherwise.  The store has always been very clean which I think reflects the attitude of the individuals who work there, a major plus.  I have been places that where the gelato is truly gourmet and is better than what I have had here.  However for being more commercial, I really can't complain with what I have had at The Gelato Spot.  They have a nice range of flavors so I think you can probably find a special and interesting flavor that will appeal to your personal tastes.  I wouldn't mind having another sugar free flavor that isn't quite so basic, but I can't have everything can I?

I questioned what to expect from this store as a neighbor said I had to go there to get the batteries changed in my watches..so reasonable.  She was exactly right..$5 to $8 for batteries.  Seems everyone in my complex have gone there and have great things to say.  The staff couldn't be more pleasant and helpful when you go in.  This last time I went in to get three watch bands and two batteries.  The only brown band they had for my every day self winding was $30 which is more than I usually spend for that watch.  The other two bands were less for two Seikos I don't wear that often.  The day after I picked up my watches a loop fell off my $30 band. I was a bit surprised but things happen, right?  I am a person who rarely return anything but the next day.  When I took it in, they could not have been more helpful, exchanged the band no questions asked.  My Mother loved her diamonds and my father enjoyed buying them for her.  I might have more knowledge in general of the way quality service should be when one is buying more expensive items.  I had enough experience listening while I waited for my parents made their purchases. Also, I've spent time listening when my Mother had her jewelry fixed and cleaned. In this respect these people also get my stamp of approval.    In closing, I will make one remark.  In any jewelry store, the goal is to sell the merchandise.  Unless one is ready to do some high end impulse buying, one should know their limits.  No, thank you, is a perfectly acceptable answer.  Keeps you out of trouble and makes browsing a delightful experience.  They are moderate to high end.  They also have more parking in the back of the building.

It certainly was a pleasant surprise to walk into this store.  I had heard stories of what the owner was trying to do.  Stories and what actually has happened  can be two entirely different things.  The owner, Leonardo, has created an series of environments in his store.  As you peruse, you go from one to another.  The hints of elegance are what set his store apart from others that are trying to do something similar.  If not done in the properly,  this could be a tacky mess.  It is just the opposite.  One could go in this store and consider doing something similar or totally different from what you already have.  He has the resources available to take what you already have and have it modified to an new feeling. That is such a plus!  He mentioned that his upholstery work has been mention in Phoenix House (Home) and Garden.  I can see that happen quite easily.  This is not a terribly large store but the owner has used the space so wisely that it doesn't have to be.  When you do in the owner does make you feel very welcome in an appropriate way.  I wouldn't miss stopping in to UFO-Universal Furnishings and Offerings.  His prices go from moderate to pricey.  Having custom upholstery done, you get what you pay for.

In reading other reviews of Alcatraz Locksmith, I see everyone has given them five stars..  My experience today was such that I won't change that.   Here's another five stars!  Todd arrived when he said he would and went to work.  He was more than willing to answer my questions and was quite agreeable about how he did it.  The answers were also couched in layman's terms that I could understand.   He is very efficient and doesn't waste time about what he is doing. I have to admit I was amazed to see all the equipment and supplies he carries in his work van.  He also works clean and doesn't leave a mess when he is done.   Todd also quoted me an approximate price for what he'd be doing for me.  I can't say I was thrilled but the job had to be done so what else could I do but  grin and bear it.  What really gave me a grin was when the cost was enough below the estimate to surprise me.  Then when I told him I had to use two different credit cards for business reasons, he was gracious about doing it that way.  This has not always been the case with service people.  With Todd, no problem.  Obviously I can suggest when you need work done on any of your locks, give Todd a call.

I really was impressed tonight when I walked over from the studio to pick up some take out.  I believe the young man's name was David who helped me.  He had just been promoted from general help to handling take outs for this location.  He's going to do well.  The service he provided was just what I could have asked for. He knew the menu and a lot of small details I wouldn't have expected.   He even made me aware that there was covered parking that I didn't know about.  I haven't been in a Pita Jungle for years but if he is representative of the type of people that the company hires, I'll go back more often.  I certainly couldn't complain about the food either!  I like vegetarian especially when there are some interesting dishes featured which they definitely have.

You can't fault the man at Als beads for being direct.  He told me that I had to many questions and he didn't have time to work with me.  I told him I planned to spend two or three hundred dollars.   I was informed told that people came in and spent far more with less questions.  Good merchandise but not for people with more than a few questions.  Als beads gets two stars only for their inventory.  If it didn't have that, it would be one.

I was speaking to another artist this weekend and commented on the piece of jewelry she was wearing.  It had some particularly nice design work. I asked her where she'd found it and she said a place I probably had never hear of.  It was from a place her friend had, Al's.  She's an astute lady and picked up on the fact I didn't want to discuss the place and asked why.   She was really surprised what I finally told her.  Her suggestion is to ask for Al if you go in.  I won't but based on the fact she's a pretty decent person, I am passing her  suggestion along to Yelp readers.

I'm truly glad to see someone has had a better experience at Al's than myself.  Based on this latest review, might I go back there now?  Absolutely... the first day we have a blizzard in july in Phoenix with 32 degrees below zero wind chill.  (No offense to Cookie who wrote that review is intended.)

I was looking at the graphs which showed I give more positives in my reviews than negatives.  Granted, I admit I would always rather be positive than negative.  Still, I like to be able to be clear with my self about my reviews and the standards I use for how many stars I give.  With this Walgreens, I can give four stars and know why.  First of all, my review does not include in anyway the pharmacy, just the rest of the store. Yes, there is one employee who is devoid of any personality.  The rest of the employees I have encountered have been a fairly nice group of people who help me find what I am looking for.   Things are fairly organized so stuff isn't to hard to find. No, not a corner of Heaven but a nice place to go in.   I especially want to compliment the Assistant Manager whose name I can't recall.  I wanted to buy quite few of a Walgreens generic product to save money.  When I asked when there'd be more, this gentleman took the time to ask me how much I needed and why.   He offered to double the next order so There'd be the quantity I wanted the next Tuesday, a rather nice touch for a customer he didn't know.  Not that I am a doubting Thomas, but when I went in the following Tuesday, I didn't know what to expect.  He followed through!     Another plus is this store is easy to get in and out of.  For any one who shops on Bell Road,  you know this is a real plus.

My niece had her baby this morning at this hospital.  From my standpoint, I have absolutely no objections concerning the whole experience from the birthing center on the second floor to her after care room up on the third floor.  In fact, the staff was a little concerned that she wasn't calling them about every little concern that might affect her after having her second c section.  Having quite a lot of  prior experience with hospitals, getting five stars from me isn't all that easy but all went just that well today.  Concerning the hospital cafeteria, the patty melt was surprisingly good, I think.  The onions rings were surprisingly bad so unless they look really fresh and warm, I'd suggest staying away from them.  Otherwise it was a good experience as to eating in the hospital cafeteria.

I put off getting my screens replaced as I expected it to be a hassle.  Exactly the opposite was my experience with these people.  I completely agree with everything Joe said about this company!  Professional, clean, courteous, reasonably priced...you name it, they are it.  They come to your home and make the screens right on the spot.  They also have different kinds of screens on their vehicle, depending on what you want.  You'd never guess I would recommend these people would you?  One more thing.  They have a minimum order for the number of screens if you want to make an appointment.  I only needed two made.-less than their minimum number.  Here is how they handled it.  They determined when they'd be in my area at another job.  If I could be at  my home when they were finished with that one, they would come to my place as soon as they were done.  It worked out perfectly.  .

Going into Mid November,  I am happy to report these people have done their job more than adequately.  If they say something will get done, it has been done in a reasonable time.   My communication with them has proved to be satisfactory when necessary.  Not an easy job to do so I'm giving them one more star on this basis.

This is a nice little store.  They get deliveries often, so I have never found the stock to be anything less than fresh. They may not have the variety I've seen in some bakery stores but I can't complain.  They have a lot of desert type things which I'd buy if I wanted to be so fat you'd have to roll me out the door on my side.  Those are best for other people than me.  The store also sells Ecograin breads.  I don't know what the difference is between those and the regular Sara Lee Breads but I like the flavors.

Dr. Rehl is a very considerate individual.  He takes his time with you which doesn't happen these days in the practice of Medicine.  He listens well and will ask the question he needs to to give you his best expertise.  Proof positive of this is the way he works with my friend who is in her fifth year of Alzheimers.  She has major allergies and I think he has done better in this area than any physician I've taken her to even before she started suffering from dementia..  His staff stays on top of things as well.  You don't see new people everytime you go in.  His people wstay with him.  No problem parking is a positive as well.  It's relatively easy to get in and get out.

Who would expect to find a delightful restaurant on Bell Road in Glendale that serves the kind of French food one would find in a cafe in France!!!  I specifically say a cafe because that is where the french go for good food and wine at reasonable prices.  La Chalet is that place and I absolutely loved it!!!  The service was low key which I can deal with.  Our questions were answered intelligently!  I have to tell you of my major fax pas that gets worse .  I asked our server what she'd recommend based on who was cooking that day.  She looked at me a bit puzzled and told me that the head chef was preparing the food that day.  He had formulated the menu so she assured me he really enjoyed preparing  all. It gets worse.   I  ordered. la Breton, crepes with egg,  Swiss cheese, rosemary ham, and mushrooms.   She told me the eggs would be served in somewhat of an over easy style, which I find usually is not done to my liking. When it comes to ethnic food I can be most particular.  Rather than take a chance I told her to tell the chef to scramble them lightly and that I promised I wouldn't ask for ketchup to put on them!  My friend had Roquefort and caramelized apples and pecans with a few other things.  I watched when she put in the order and noticed the look she got, I was certain, when she said scrambled.  I was to far away to hear them.  At that point I realized there might be the slightest chance had just insulted the man who formulated the dish in a typically American way.  I needed to have some faith and try the food the way he wanted to prepare it.  With a certain amount of humility, I walked over and told them to do it his way.  Perhaps I have just become jaded and "ye of little faith" when I hear the words authentically prepared".  In this case I was rewarded handsomely for taking the risk.  The crepes were buckwheat and cooked just as thin and light as a cloud, along with the eggs and rosemary ham and mushrooms.   This is french food at it's best!  My friends dish looked and was as wonderful.  With raspberry ice tea which was so tasty in itself, the meal would come to just over $20, less than many common things you can have other  places.  With French or Swiss wine, of course it would be more.  But then again, how many restaurants in Phoenix even serve any Swiss wine.  The coup DE gras was still to come and I didn't know it.  I, personally, am not much of a desert eater.  My diet is 162 pounds and I stay at that weight with a lot of discipline. I have never been much of a chocolate fancier.   My dining companion was determined that we should have chocolate fondue for two, ($16).  I have learned better than to disagree with a determined woman, so order it we did.  When they placed the fondue pot of rich brown Swiss liquid chocolate, surrounded by beautiful red strawberries, ice cream puffs, apples, and brownie pieces, my resolve dissolved in a heartbeat.  Simply just wonderful!  I consider myself fortunate that I can be the first individual to review La Chalet  on Yelp!  It gets the highest of ratings from me because it is what it is, excellently prepared French food at prices that don't give you indigestion when you think of paying the bill later.  So I don't forget, they also offer some very inviting meat dishes to be fried at your table, wrapped crepes, and creative salads as well. I believe I have found a restaurant that I will continue going to until I've have tried everything on the menu at some time.  After today's experience, I can't imagine it isn't going to be a real pleasure not to make repeat trips to la Chalet.   They may have to put an apple in my mouth and roll me out on my side when I have done so but it will have been worth it!

What do you say about a restaurant where the food is terrific.  No question about the way it is fixed and I don't think it could be much better.  A place where you don't have to go broke getting really fine French food.  Maybe not as exotic as some places but just good French food...the type you might find at a cafe in France.  You say no reason not to return.  And the deserts!  The chocolate!  You have to go there to see their desert menu!  Splurge!  The glitch last night was the service.  I have no problem with relaxed service.  Who wants to be hurried.   With the exception of getting a small glass for my friend's seven up, we were not people hard to serve.  That is not an excuse to be borderline neglected. I refer to minor things like checking back often enough to see water glasses are filled often enough for there to be ice in it to keep it cool.  Or just for there to be water, especially if the person is having water as their only drink with the meal.   I expect that.  Watching your server outside the front door when the water needs to be filled?  What to do when you are ready to leave and your server is having a long conversation across the room with another employee.  Finally I had to make a decision whether to go get him myself or ask the young man who was helping the table next to us to go get him?  Last but not least, how difficult is it to remember to bring a bag to put  take out containers in when you have just been asked?  I gave up on that one.  When I left I just walked past my server carrying them out.  Guess he didn't notice?  The question might be asked why were these minor things annoying enough for me to say more about the service than the food itself.  My dining companion didn't want to go to for French food but did it for me.  She had no complaints about the food-thought it was excellent.  She thought the ambiance of the restaurant was nice.  However,  the service embarrassing.  This is a major sore spot for me when it happens.  I make no apologies for it.       I might tell you one other thing.  I have GERD.  If you don't know what that is, I will tell you I have to be careful about what I eat or I can get major indigestion, etc.   I knew I'd pay for what I ate and i did.  But when certain types of French food are prepared properly, I am willing to suffer.   What better recommendation can I give than that!

Phoenix needs more stores like this.  It has some really interesting flavors of yogurt and more different kinds of toppings than one might expect,.  The keep it more than clean and the staff is really a nice group of kids.  The relaxed setting makes you feel like stopping and having a few minutes to just enjoy your self and friends.  We are lucky to have this store in Phoenix.

I was at yogurtology and found out that they have "doggie yogurt" there  from time to time.  What fun was it to walk up last night to watch a couple of ladies feeding their dogs out of small cups at a table on the walkway out front.  Did it seem out of place, not at all.  Another thing I like about this store and this center.  Call about the "doggie yogurt" if you want some.  They don't always have it.

The service here was fine.  The food came out faster than I remember in the past.  I think Carl's Jr food is something you have to acquire a taste for.  I never have.

I went to Dillons planning to have a serious conversation with friends last night, so the food was not  top on the list of my priorities.  In spite of that I was impressed by the food and the service.  I appreciated the fact the server was very knowledgable about was being served.  She also gave some real thought to questions concerning the sauces  and recommendations we asked her to make.  She also kept our drinks flowing moderately including keeping my water glass topped off.  As i don't drink, often times, I end up with a half empty glass which I invariably have to ask to get refilled.  Not so here;  udos to the server.  I had the pulled chicken sandwich which certainly tender enough with a very fresh bun.  The mild sauce was about what our server said it would be.  Next time I will go for something stronger though.  Concerning the goal of the evening, I was going very mild in everything I ate.  The potato salad had a nice flavor but was just a scoop in a little bowl.  One of my pet peeves, it just looked boring.  What really surprised me as it would have been the last thing I'd have ever ordered was my friends stew.  The stew was a luscious combination of meat and vegetables.  It almost looked almost like a thick soup.  I like it when something just looks like it would be something I'd really like to have just seeing it. .  My friend said it was as appetizing as it looked.  This is what I will have the next time I go there.  No problems parking but this was during the middle of the week so don't know about weekends.

Five stars for Freddy of Fox Plumbing!  First let me tell you my father was a general contractor so I can be and will be more critical about service people than most.  I've watched the work be done.  I've seen the people who took pride in what they did and how they worked.  As my Dad's one man clean up crew, I didn't appreciate a slob to clean up after either!  (This gentleman certainly wasn't that.)  Now, my evaluation of Freddy from Fox plumbing.  I had him do work on a Friend's"s rental.  He received almost perfect fives from all the people from yelp who reviewed him.  They said the kinds of things I would want to hear if I was doing the work myself.  Still, my contact with him first was over the phone and I wasn't going to be there when he was doing the work, so i was concerned.  As it turned out, I was able to meet Freddy and watch him work a few minutes but didn't expect to.  He's polite, can explain what he's doing in terms you can understand, and works clean.  That's a nice combination in a service individual.  Freddy was able to do all I asked him to do, plus he picked up on some issues that would be problems in the future.  I don't know about you but I would rather spend a little money now than bigger money later.  That's what a true professional does for you!  Do take advantage of the special voucher that can save you $55.  I had never heard of a yelp deal before, have you?  You go to his website and you will see the following...it's worth it.   One more reason to consider using Fox Plumbing.  Buy a Yelp Deal Buy a Gift Certificate  $95 for $150 Deal at Fox Plumbing A voucher redeemable for $150 at Fox Plumbing.

I had heard about this place but never could find it.  I finally called human resources at ASU and they were able to get me a couple phone numbers for it.  My first impression.  I walked in the front door and a man was yelling at them that he was going to report them for bad service.  This wasn't all that bad as he didn't seem like the type that anyone could ever please at any time concerning anything.  I spent years in retail.  I can spot that type in a nanosecond.  The operation is separated into two sections.  The first  warehouse is merchandise that is sold retail.  I found a great buy on an mac especially after one of the guys came out to me to where I wanted to go (a major plus as far as I am concerned) and explained to me the benefits of each and why one was so much better than the others.  More expensive but should last me a long, long time.  I could deal with that kind of explanation.    Same person took my money and saw that I got all the cords and doodads to operate it.  I plan on going next month to be a large monitor for it.   At time I will put the whole thing together and use it.  No need on instant gratification on my part, I guess.   As I had just come from waiting in line to get my car emission tested, then going to get my license plate tabs, i didn't have much more time.  I guess they have another entire warehouse full of stuff they auction off.  I din't make it that far.  However, the stuff in the retail warehouse was so reasonable that I probably would stop there.  One thing they had that quite surprised me was a real selection of bikes for sale most of them not to bad.    Interesting place to check out.  I'd say the prices are pretty inexpensive unless you are looking for one of the most expensive things the sell, which is pretty typical for me.

I went back today to see what else I might be interested in.  Most of the merchandise in the "retail" warehouse is in good shape so no problems there.  I found everything from office supplies to art work to bikes to miscellaneous.  I was looking for an office chair.  I sat in a bunch of them and kept going back to one.   I would have preferred another color but it felt so much better than the rest that I took it, $5.00.  In addition, I bought a Rolodex and a few other things.  Total bill was under $!0.  After I got home I was looking at the bottom of it  and discovered my $5.00 chair is a Herman Miller!  Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus!

I plan on contacting these people tomorrow about replacing the apple I bought from them.  The apple people completely downloaded a new operating system for me and I still can't open Hotmail, gmail, Utube etc.  Everything is okay if you don't have to sign in to anything.  The people at the Apple store have said they have never seen anything quite like it.  I will fill you in on what the Do.  If they aren't willing to work with me, I intend to contact  University president, the BBB, And one of the television stations that helps with things like this.  At this point for anything more than furniture or small office supplies, I say AYOR.

If you are even thinking of buying a computer, I've lowered it to one star.  I  just gave up on the Apple computer I bought here.  One problem after another, I finally gave up when it kept crashing every two to three minutes.  I put on the most expensive virus system possible.  Nothing helps this machine I was sold.  End result is I am junking the thing.  Buy furniture here, buy office supplies.  Buy a computer...never.

This is one time when I am writing a review because I saw a great review of a store and I wanted to say I agree completely with Crystal D.  I rate the two Saba Stores in Scottsdale rate five stars because in addition to the great selection, it has always come with service that I rate as excellent.  I will admit to you that I have not shopped at many other western stores.  Why should I when I've always been much more than satisfied going to Saba's.  Here are a few of my experiences shopping there.  I found out the store had already closed when I went to make my purchase and I didn't know it.  That's a major plus with me,  I always try to be out of an establishment before closing time on principle. I worked in retail. It truly surprised me that I had no idea they had already closed from the people in the store. I can usually tell.  I came to buy a gift for my employer's former boss. I couldn't tell them much more about him than his age, general interests, and what size he wore. Their suggestion turned out to be a hit with a genuinely nice man who I know not to be easily pleased. He and his son wear the same size.  Guess who receives a lot of things from his Dad.   I have stopped by or called on more than a few occasions just to find out who they might recommend for something.  They have never failed to be less than gracious at all times and.  I've never had a problem with a return at Saba's.  That includes when it was a little embarrassing for me as we'd spent a bit of time working on finding some thing.  Any wonder why it is that I just stick with Sabas?

I consider this to be one of the best places in Phoenix to look for antiques.  They don't allow junk in the door.  That is not to say their is anything wrong with junk shops.  I know someone who got a Tiffany lamp at an obscenely low price at a junk slop in New York once.  This just is not the place to go looking if that is what you want.  THEY HAVE MOVED!  The new address is 730 E Missouri in the Bashas shopping center where the old Buffalo exchange store used to be.  The store will reopening on March 7.  The new location is easy to get to with ample parking.  The store it self is wonderfully laid out.  It is very open and well lit  Check it out, they have really worked to make it very customer friendly.  Obviously, I am very biased but I do think you will find it well worth going in to see what they have done!   Oh, concerning prices,  I would say moderate to high end.  It depends on what you want to spend to go home with a new treasure!

This is one of those delightful little consignment and resale stores that I find out of town but not often in Phoenix.  The owner, Jeff, says it offers "eclectic treasures".  That would be one way of putting it.  Another is that you don't know quite what you might find there and that makes it worth going there and experiencing it.  It is far from fancy and as he doesn't have a high overhead, he can keep the prices down.  I saw antiques to knick knacks to furniture to live plants and that was in only one quick visit to the store this morning.  That to me is the real charm of this store.  Usually you would find it in a more bohemian part of a large city and it is has popped up in Phoenix?  How did I find out about it?  A friend who works in a high end antique store in the Valley had heard about it from another friend.  She wasn't quite sure of the location but knew it was on the South side of the road, she thought.  She knew it had consignment and resale but that was about it.    The is one of those stores that word of mouth is going to help keep open.  I hope Yelp helps to do this.  Digging around for "treasure's" doesn't bother me.  It takes be back to a simpler place and time.  There are some framed theatre posters there that are begging me to go back and bring them home tomorrow. Best part is I can afford to think about them bring from this funky store; in another place I am not sure I'd be able to.  Speaking of prices.  I hesitated to put inexpensive or moderate.  Check it out for yourselves.

This was a nice place to go and have some different types of food on a busy first friday.  Haven't had to much experience with the food but it certainly had some interesting flavors.  The setting was fun as well.  I thought my blue corn enchiladas were flavorful as were the accompanying greens and beans.    The food and setting was good enough  for the fourth star.  A perfect first friday type of place to go.  If you enjoy it,  it's open other days of the week, too.

Weird Experience  This review concerns the strange behavior of Kathy, the owner of this company.   Furthermore, I want you to know that I haven't read any of the other reviews concerning Kathy and her company so I can say none have affected what I have to say.  I went to an estate sale held by this company this afternoon.  It wasn't terribly exciting but I spent time picking up some things that I found would be useful.  My habit is to start a collection of things which accumulate as I spend time looking.  I did see what item that I knew a friend might enjoy having but wanted to give it some thought.  The employees were all very friendly enough so that I decided to put my name on their email list.  Overall it was a good experience.    As I was getting ready to make up my mind about things, I saw a man put the gold filigree item I had decided to buy for my friend in a plastic bag and walk out to the patio.  I had waited to long which was sad as I know she'd have really enjoyed it..  Later I returned to  to the patio to decide if wanted to buy two pieces of patio furniture, a lounger and a glider.  I saw the man with the plastic bag putting more stuff in the bag and them put it next to a table.  He was an employee so I decided to ask him if he was buying the bag of stuff.  When he said no so I asked him if I could get something out of it.  He said go ahead.  As I did a very unpleasant woman walked up and told me that the bag was trash and to put everything back into it that it wasn't "cool" to look in it.  She then told me if I wanted any of it that I could go in the alley and dig it out of the trash!  I then suggested sh could be a little nicer about how she had said what she did to me.  She made a remark I didn't hear and stomped off.  I asked the nearest worker who she was and they said she was the boss, Kathy.  Rarely can I say I have been as offended as I was by as I was person.  It was obvious that she has no sense of how you deal with customers.  My experience is that she was a very mean spirited individual.  What bothered me even more was that she was trying to belittle me for even wanting to look in the bag.   I knew that  thing wasn't the case but pity the person who might be a bit timid would feel shamed by this person.  Most people would have just walked out but I had spent time getting these things I wanted and I was going to have them.  However, the first thing I did was get a black Sharpie and cross my name of the email list.  Kathy will never get another cent of my money.  I then purchased my items and told the employes what happened.  They said she'd just had a problem and apologized if she took it out on me.  Possibly that was the case but at that point, I just wanted to leave.   I hoped her day went better but I wasn't going to be part of it.  Now is the thing that happened that was the icing on the cake of a truly weird experience.   I truly was trying to have some sympathy for this woman, Kathy. We all have bad days, I was trying to be understanding?  As I was carrying my things out to the car, I stopped to open my hatchback.  As I did, Kathy was drove by giving me an ugly smile, and waving.  This is a very sad person.  ***Now that I have written this review, I've read the other reviews  I would suggest you read them including the two that aren't recommended.  These people have dealt directly with Kathy as well!***

I saw someone with a Jersey Mike's box the other day or I wouldn't have known they existed.  I was told to try the place as the subs they got there were the best they had had for a long time.   I had to make a decision whether to go their or AJ's this week.  I have to tell you Jersey Mike's had two strikes against it before I walked in there so I almost didn't.   I am not a big sub person.  Usually the bread is satisfactory but that is about it.  The second strike is most places that advertise themselves as being from a specific area offer a product  you really have to develop a taste for  if you are ever really going to enjoy it.  Maybe if you are from there... ?  I was about that far from not going in...  I am glad that I did.  They don't offer all the toppings one might find at the other large chains. Only two kinds of bread?  The difference is in the quality of what they do offer.  That by far makes up the difference.  I had a toasted veggie wrap and really enjoyed it.  Everything was fresh and crisp without an overpowering ranch dressing.  Nice fresh bread that tasted like it had been baked that day.  Enough to fill you up without making you feel stuffed.  I have no problems with the thought of going back.    One more plus for Jersey Mike's.  I had to wait longer than I expected.  When I finally did get my order, I mentioned it was my first time there.  I was immediately told they were shorthanded and got an apology for having had to wait as long as I did.  That really impressed me as they were really busy and it was genuine, not lip service.     Nice place.

My experience has been when you go into this branch, you have to ask for help or they totally ignore you.  I live near this place and have been going in from time to time since they opened.  I have gone in wearing a suit and tie, casual Armani, in jeans and a t shirt straight from the gardening.  Only once have I ever had someone walk up and offer me any service and that was about a year ago.  Last time I went in I was determined to walk out with tomato plants.   I finally asked a man for some help.   He gave me his opinion concerning which types to get which sounded reasonable so I  told him I would take two of the same kind.  He also helped me find a box of fertilizer!  I was in heaven-all this service at Summerwinds-going home with two tomato plants and a box of fertilizer!  When I got to the counter, I mentioned they were both celebrity while they were looking of for the identifying tags.  I was then informed they were two different types of tomato plants.  At that point, I took what I had and left.    Today, I went in thinking I really had developed an attitude about the place and I could do better.  I immediately took one of the carts and headed back to the living plants.  Two of the employees passed me by as I searched for what I wanted and I was there for awhile.  I would have bought more but was tired of looking.  As I went to the register another employee passed by without speaking a word.  When I finally got to the register I was annoyed.  The one thing they will do is try to get you one of their customer cards!!!  I told them I wouldn't be back and why.  They seemed shocked???  I just wanted to be rung up and leave which is exactly what I did.  When I got home I noticed two of the lettuce plants in the six pack I purchased were almost dead.  Check your plants carefully before you leave this place.  Think I am going back to get those plants replaced...WE WILL HAVE SNOW TOMORROW BEFORE I DO THAT.  Two things you should know that affect my attitude.    The first is I spent thirty five years in sales.  How much work does it take to at least acknowledge a customer.?  I've gotten ignored by young and old.  I also have made a point of always smiling when I go in Summerwinds...I used to. There are other places to go.  This branch of Summerwinds needs a crash course in customer service.  Pitiful.  The second thing you should know is that we had blooming flowers all year long at our home  in Phoenix every year when I was growing up.   That meant all the summer plants came out in the fall and were replaced and then replaced again in the spring and summer.  My family spent money at the nurseries-a great deal of money.  I have continued this practice.  For me to walk out of a nursery without having spent less than $50.00 is almost embarrassing.  It is so bad that I even have a tarp to put in the back of my car that I bought strictly for use when I go to buy plants.  Glad other people haven't had the experience I have had at Summerwinds.  The only thing I wish to say in closing is that if you go in there you take your chances.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Looks great when you go in but prepare for the worst.

A little feed back.  About half of the flowering plants I bought from from Summerwinds have died or are dying.  How hard is it to kill a petunia!   All of them were planted in new soil.  I was told that I could take the dead ones back.  Id prefer to buy better quality to begin with.  I counted that I have eighteen pots of plants not including those just in the ground.  over 100 plants in all.

I like this place!   When I was growing up, my Mother and Grandmother, were determined to put weight on me with their hamburgers.  There'd usually be a 1/2 pound of meat covered with the freshest condiments you might ask for.  Having come from a dairy ranch where they got the freshest beef you could ask for,  any beef they bought had to be up to their standards.  I ate well when we had hamburgers.  My mushroom with swiss burger was the first I have had in a long  time that brought back those child hood memories.  The Burger itself is really to big for two hands to hold and I have large hands.  So the bottom bun got soggy.  The beef was fresh enough for it to get that way as you bite into the beef and tastes good in the process!  My friend had a burger with bacon on it.  They have eight kinds of bacon to choose from.  She had sugar cured and it was thick cut and yummy.  I am going to go out on a limb and say I think the Oink has the best burgers in Phoenix!

I didn't know Songbiord existed until this week.  They certainly have a selection and it all looks and sounded good.  I really didn't want anything but lemon bars always catch my eye.  Alas they have entirely to much sugar for me.  I did notice something interesting but couldn't figure out what it was.  Jonathan, behind the counter,  really is helpful.  He told me it was a croisant with Jalepenos.  When I commented i usually stay away from the really hot peppers he said the way they were fixed, they were almost sweet.  I trusted him and had to agree.  Tonight I went in and found another reason for knowing this is a good place to go.  It was first friday and as the zombie walk was going by they locked the door.  Its fine to have fun but they were banging on the windows and door as they went by.  Good thinking on the part of Jonathan!  Put the zombies in the gutter, please.

The only reason I am tempted to give Tesla less than 5 stars is I have only been there once.  However, I can say I was completely satisfied with my experience there.  The car seems to be absolutely everything they say it will be-I didn't drive it.  I have been in 41 car accidents do I really know what to look at when I look for things to fit as they should will things rattle later, etc.  A car put together beautifully!  The lumbar support I could fall in love with as with the finish of this delightful vehicle.  The service is certainly above what you would expect.  I bought a baby outfit for a little one who is on the way.  The individual ringing it up for me noticed the lettering wasn't straight as it should be and got another before I noticed it.  He also took the time to answer any question I might have after I made it clear I wouldn't buy it..  In all ways I was offered more than I expected wandering in their store at the mall.  I even think I will go back and test drive a Tesla which they encouraged just as a learning experience knowing I just bought a new car of a different brand.    After the attitude I encountered all the way around their they are getting 5 stars after all.  Why not, they impressed me and I spent 35 years in sales; not an easy thing to do! Besides, I found a baby gift for someone who is always surprised by the fun and interesting gifts I have given her in the past.  Tesla has helped me make sure this baby gift will be nothing less!

The slogan for greenHUAS is   "find a way to make Beauty necessary  +  then find a way to make Necessity beautiful"   Their business card says they sell jewelry, accessories, art, furniture, and vintage.  I really enjoy this eclectic little store.  They really do have a smattering of the wonderful things mentioned above without overdoing it.  if they don't have as much merchandise as some establishments, what they have is of quality.    The owners couldn't be more pleasant. They make you feel almost at home, which is interesting as their home is in the back of the building.  It's the kind of place that is worth it just to go in and find out what they have at any given time.    Two weeks ago, I saw a delightful yellow depression glass cup and saucer,  almost the same as I remember seeing in Waco, Texas, when I was a teenager. Don't ask me why but I couldn't stop think about it.  Twice i went by there but they were gone and the lights were off.   I made a special trip there tonight and again arrived after they closed.  They saw me at the window, smiled, and opened the door so I could come in.  That doesn't seem like a big thing but quite late after the hectic  First Friday crowds, who would want to do that?  The couldn't have been more gracious about it,  and all for only for a ten dollar sale!  This is a store that will be easy on the mind to just go in for a browse at the end of a long day...or any other time.  Five stars for sure in my opinion.

This is a delightful place if you don't want chain style food.  There is a place for chain restaurants, but I like to find a place that can be whatever the owners want because it is an independent.  They have more control over what they buy so you hopefully you should be able to expect better quality for the food you meal is made from.  Gadzooks doesn't disappoint in this area.  I went in there this afternoon more to look to the menu than to eat.  All of us have had one of those weeks where you are tired but have just enough energy to do something you've been meaning to do for what seems forever.  That was my day.  When I got in there I found a very creative menu, almost more than I wanted to deal with.  With the people being s welcoming and the restaurant so clean I decided to go for it.  †ruthfully, I let them recommend things and told them to use their judgement on them They had a lot of interesting choices to make from the tortillas to the cheeses to the condiments.  Once I sat down and ate, I guess I got some of my energy back because I started considering how I could have changed things from the many interesting ingredients that were available.  Next time, I will make it a real adventure to put together my meal.  Go and have fun here...definitely not your chain Mexican food.  II think it would be a great place to take a group and find out how many different combinations people could end up at the same table.  There is seating outside for people who enjoy that.  The cornbread tacos stood out for me!

I have been shopping at this store since they opened the doors.  I really like the store and the way it is set up.  They have merchandise in this store that other CVS stores in the Phoenix Metro area don't have.  It is always well organized and clean.  I like that.  The most important thing they have is the  same crew that has been there for some time.  With the exception of a couple of people, you usually see the same faces when you go in.  These long time employees make you feel welcome and will help you find what you need.  It is not unusual for their employees even to TAKE you to what you need!   Good people that work hard and their store certainly shows it.  Talking about the pharmacy in this store.  I can't say enough for their staff.  They really care about their customers. If you have a question, the pharmacist will explain what's what to expect in a way that can be understood.  The employees will take time to get things right. You have a problem with your insurance company and they will make a genuine help to get it resolved.  The times when they have to say I'm sorry we are waiting on the insurance company or the Doctor they have tried.  It tells you something when you see an equal amount of age groups that use them.  They seem to be able to work satisfactory with everyone.  I have seen the same customers come in sick as a dog and just wanting to get out.  I have seen the same people come in later in a good mood smiling because of a decent experience when they were sick.    A final comment on this location that tells me why I like this store as much as I did.  I have yet to see an employee who is stupid, surly, or just doesn't fit in, last in this store.  There was a pharmacy employee who made me crazy by how that person did there job.  I finally decided that if that person was working, I'd just start going back at another time.  For the length of time that person had been there, she just didn't really have a clue as to what she was doing.  The next time I went in this person had been go.  I wasn't the only one happy.  The staff was sick of covering for her.  Another example of what they do to make this a store I want to keep going back to.  They aren't perfect but they are are working toward it.  I really enjoy writing a review like this!

Two years later I still have nothing to say but the best for this CVS location.  They remodeled the store to make it more user friendly.  During this time, they have continue to have a staff with great attitudes.  That includes having fired three employees that really had issues.  They just didn't keep them on.  This isn't as big a store as some but they do it right.  How many times can you say that based on a number of years?

I took myself to the Otro Cafe for my Birthday today.  This is one of those nice independent places you might not find if you weren't looking for it.  I knew it was there and because my favorite pharmacist recommended it, I decided why not.   The food was interesting, I had the three enchiladas each with a different sauce.  I found I was expected to get all three with the same ingredients.  Because it was my birthday, and the cook was new, they let me get two vegetable and one chicken. I think i was there on the right night to be able to have gotten that substitution.  I won't plan on it happening again if I go on another night. When your server tells you about the sauces listen to.  What they describe as spicy will be.  The ingredients are fresh and tasty.  I do think I preferred the vegetable enchiladas but thought a bit more cheese in them would have been a nice touch.    More modern Latin food is served here. Some I haven't tried so I plan on going back to try some of the other items on the menu.  What I saw coming out to other diners looked intriguing.    I say the prices are moderate but that doesn't include alcohol.  If you have drinks, I don't know.  Nice interior that is clean and simple.  I like that with some interesting art on the walls.  They have a nice patio out front.  Parking is not a problem at all and it is easy to find.

At last I have found a restaurant with lip smacking peanut butter cookies in the Valley and I have looked!  Just the kind my Mother, a gourmet cook, would have put in front of me!  If for nothing else than these cookies,  the Phoenix Public Market would get five stars.  As it goes the pork sandwich was very good as was the gazpacho soup with melon balls, a very nice touch.  A nice fennel salad on the side made for a nice over all impression on my taste buds!    Go to this restaurant for an interesting meal and good service.  You'll enjoy it.

First thing you should know is I am an Art Curator so anything having to do with art,  I perceive differently.  I don't want to seem like a snob but I can't help but judge any artistic concept differently than most people would.    The prepared set up of individual canvases, three brushes, and a plate of colors looked simple enough.   I asked myself could the teacher and staff make it easy enough that just about anyone could do it.  Even more important than could they do it would be, could they enjoy it? I am happy to report that they do just that and quite well.  I don't drink but I imagine a couple of drinks make it easier for some people?  The provided food is good, just right for nibbling as the staff directs you to create your personal masterpiece.  A camaraderie  quickly develops with those around you as people find they don' have to take themselves to seriously but just have fun. The staff makes every effort to see that occurs.  Surprisingly, perhaps, you most likely will come out with a finished canvas that you won't look at and cry.    This would be a great place to go with friends and watch each other just be their own Picasso.  It might be a really fun place to take someone on an interesting date.  Now that I have done it myself, I know eventually I'll have to make an excuse to go back.  I'm an art curator.  I buy a fair amount of art.  Maybe it's time to have another piece of my own hanging at home.

There is a wonderful little book shop in Phoenix that has opened within walking distance of my home.   That makes me a happy camper.  My 80 year old friend, a former newspaper reporter took me there today.. If it excited him, I wanted to see it!  My first reaction was it reminded me of the little independent book sellers I used to find in San Diego in Hillcrest, before the big chains moved in.  It has a real neighborhood feel to it, a place to browse at the end of a long day or just when you have a little time to relax.  It's a small space that has books on quite a few subjects without seeming clutter and disorganized.  They have used the space wisely.    Sven, the owner, said they used to be located near 7th and Osborn, but I don't remember it.  The best way to tell you is that you will ding this shop in the same strip center as Luci's Marketplace.  What some people don't now is there is parking in the back as well.  There's not a lot of parking spaces in front so don't let that stop you.  Because I was on my evening walk with my friend, I didn't have time to really spend looking around the shop.  It certainly has an inviting atmosphere.  Want to saver some money, lol, who doesn't.  The Grand Opening is Black Friday,  November 29th and 30th,  Everything in the store will be 20% off.  They buy, sell and trade and more.  Check out the website.

I don't eat beef very often so probably don't know what to expect like some of you.  The owner there was very polite, brought my meal to me.  He also checked back with me.  This is not a fancy place, It is basic and very clean.  If it wasn't,  I would have walked out.  Last two places I went that weren't I walked out with food poisoning over the years.  The True kitchen at the Billtmore being the exception...it was clean.  Overall I liked it.  The meat was very fresh and not overly spiced. Plenty of it.  I enjoyed the fact it just had a nice flavor with no gristle.    I will go back and next time will have the gyros.  If they are as good, I will be happy!

This used to be checkers and now is OReilly's.  As an auto parts store it has about as mnuch as you could ask for.  They have plenty of parking and except when the suicide lane is in effect, it is easy to get to.  I would just like to recommend,  Gage, who works there.  I am not exactly a lamb being lead to the slaughter when it comes to my car, but reliable information does help.  He thinks before he answers you.  I like that.

I went to see Copellia by Ballet AZ recently.  I have been away from their performances for a some time.  I had a bad experience as a volunteer.  I had hear there had been some major changes in the company and how things were being staged.  That is the truth.  The performance was nice, what I would expect from a regional company, not as strong as I had come to expect.  This is not the companies fault.  They did as well as they could be expected to.  The dancers are hard workers and it showed.   It seems though there are a few pieces missing.   They have lost so many of their strong dancers.  It is going to take take time to build up to what they were.  I have to ask what happened that so many of their core people and up and coming dancers left?  With time and attrition, a certain amount can be expected but this many?  Younger dancers benefit from interacting with more experienced performers.  If it isn't there,  it will just take longer.  What is going to happen for if they need a more mature male for a lead.  Makeup can do a certain amount but the depth and strength of maturity of a strong dancer comes with time.  I also understand that people who regularly came over from Europe (Denmark and others) to stage performances aren't coming over any longer.  it gave the dancers a certain experience that only comes from working with people like this.  It allowed us, the audience, to see things that reflected world trends in Ballet..  The artistic director can't be all things to all people, can they.  There are going to be people who are thinking that this review is to degrade what the Ballet AZ is doing these days;  quite the opposite actually.   I got over my own bad experience to come and watch Ballet AZ as it is today.  I just didn't expect what I have come to. There have been changes.   You might say why four stars instead of three if that is the case.  The dancers work hard and I honor that!   When a situation exists like this is a time when they need our support the most.
