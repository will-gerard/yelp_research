This place is great! The staff is very friendly & the food is great for the price. Not to mention awesome drink specials ($3 for Grey Goose anyone?), and the bartender pours with a heavy hand.  Very eclectic music and fun arcade games, though we didn't play any. Being it a dive bar, I had my reservations of the clientele in the place, but when we all joined in for a group rendition of some 80s love songs, I knew it was all good.

This place is great! They make pizza, wings, sandwhiches, salad and pastas, though I have only ever tried their pizza. They prepare a good variety of pizzas to choose from plus their slices are huge. So far I've had the pepperoni, pesto chicken, and buffalo chicken - all excellent (and great crust). They offer a "party pizza" which is 24". The place gets really busy during lunch hours and it may take awhile to receive your order, but there is plenty of seating. Just be aware of the idots that stand in front of the fountain machine.

I've been here more times than I can count & it is always delicious.  Usually pretty busy and hard to find seating, but the food is enough to keep me coming back.  They have added pizza to the menu which I have yet to try, but looks amazing.  They have also added a lot more Italian items to their grocery than when I first started coming & organized it a little better. Wonderful!

I frequent this place during the week for lunch and have never been disappointed! The food is delicious and the portions are outstanding for the price.   Extremely friendly service and it doesn't take them long to learn what you like. Always willing to cater to the guests.  My one & only "complaint" would be I wish the place was bigger, sometimes it's hard to find a seat at their busy times.  You really ought to check this place out. Besides, it's hard to go wrong with Greek food!

I admit I had my  reservations about coming to an Indian food buffet, but this place pleasantly surprised me. $9.95 for the dinner buffet & $7.95 for lunch.  There are not as many choices as one would expect from a buffet, but the food is so good that you won't be bothered - the chicken marsala was my favorite. I love the tea that comes free with the buffet (along with mango smoothies). And they automatically bring garlic naan bread (delicious!) and chicken tandoori as an appetizer - free!  The staff is extremely friendly & attentive - my glass never reached half empty. While I appreciate it, they are almost TOO attentive at times, to the point where it's slightly uncomfortable. Also, they don't assign one waiter to a table, just whoever is available checks on you, which brings a lot of repetition - as satisfied as I was, I didn't want to have to keep telling each individual waiter I was doing OK every 5 minutes.   Still, India Oven serves wonderful food and I will definitely be a repeat customer.

This lunch visit came from a suggestion from my boyfriend who claims the portion sizes are a great deal for the money - which is true. However, the less of this subpar food the better. I had the Hunan Special Chicken and my boyfriend had the General Tso Chicken. I'm more of a fan of white meat than dark meat, and most of the chicken that was visible through the fried fat and skin was dark.   The staff was friendly enough but the place was dirty (food on the walls) and the parking lot is a joke. If you are in the mood for Chinese food, do yourself a favor and pass up this place.

No call no show for my appointment. I waited several hours for them, wasting my day off. I left several voicemails with no phone call back. I tried calling for a few days after that to see what happened and try to reschedule, but they never answer the phone. Looks like I'm not the first & only to experience this kind of bad customer service judging by previous reviews. No communication from them since. I don't know how one can run a profitable business like this. I would not recommend using (or at least trying to use) C & N.
