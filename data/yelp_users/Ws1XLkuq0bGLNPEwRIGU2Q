I will start by saying I was too lazy to drive over to my favorite Mexican restaurant on Cinco De Mayo so I decided to give this place a second try.  I ordered the Chili Colorado, what they called red chili beef. I received the smallest portion for $12. The meat was tough and flavorless. The corn tortillas were almost see thru and hard. It gets better the rice & beans were bland. I ate it because I was hungry but it was gross. On a positive note, they have friendly staff. They just desperately need a new cook. Overall, don't waste your money or appetite on this disgraceful Mexican food.

I love this place. Today, I had lunch with a friend and were very happy! We shared the Trio appetizer and were very satisfied. The guacamole was Awesome, the salsa was spicy and very flavorful, and the chipole dip was divine. My friend had the Shrimp salad with rasberry vinagirette. She said the shrimp was flavorful and cooked to perfection. The mixture of sweet and tangy is a tasty combination. I had the Caballero Chicken salad with spicy chipole ranch. I love this salad because it's fresh, crisp, and so good. The chicken is charcol broiled and melts in your mouth.  It's the perfect place for lunch with a friend.  The service is friendly and quick.

If your looking for a couples experience this is the place to come. Our experience was one of a kind and exceptional. We walked into a relaxing calm room surrounded by fake rose petals and chocolate kisses. It was totally romantic, invigorating, and relaxing for my husband and I. We had a good time while getting a massage and taking time to slow down. We took advantage of the coupon found in the mail and it was worth every penny.The best part, the staff was professional and everything was very clean. I am a happy customer.

Glamor Nails is the best place in the area and the one stop shop for your beauty needs. They use top of the line products, it is very sanitary, and they are willing to cater to your needs and wants. Free WIFI is the best! Lam always has the newest line from OPI prominently displayed. Eyebrow waxing is great! Lam and his team believe in quality work and customer service. It is so true... if you please your customer and do good work they will continue to return. I know I will! Word of mouth is the best advertisement and I'm going to tell everyone I know. Keep up the good work!

I LOVE Lori at Generations Mobil Tanning. I am so impressed with her work and her prices are AHHmazing. I am a huge supporter of small business so I am thrilled to share my experience. So far, I have received 2 spray tans from her and they were gorgeous. Lori is professional, thorough with application and uses high quality products. So first off, I filled out a questionnaire with all my info, expectations and desires for my tan. Then she sprayed my entire body with a primer which helps your skin absorb the color rich and evenly. Next, she dries your body with this amazing spray machine. After, she beings airbrush spraying your body with the tanning solution, she guides you to move certain ways to make sure the color applies evenly. I am so impressed with her service and skill. I especially LOVE $15 Fridays. My tans usually last me 14 days. I am addicted and can't wait for my next one. Generations Spray Tan accepts cash/debit/credit cards. This is a MUST do experience. They even have a new professional space that is gorgeous. Very private and one of a kind superior service. P.S. This tan makes you look svelte and slimmer too! ;)

This has to be my 20th visit since they opened. My most favorite Mexican restaurant in Arizona! I especially LOVE the Chili Colorado plate and I pretty much get the same thing every time. The meat is full of flavor and tender. When it comes to appetizers, the cheese crisp is so yummy and they have the most delicious piled high nachos. The portions are incredible. I love the chips & salsa. They have 3 different salsa's regular, medium and hot. The service is friendly & prompt. Overall, I love the friendly service and you can always count on delicious affordable Mexican food every time you visit.

We LOVE Johnny B's pizza! My husband & I have been going here since they opened. We picked up dinner tonight because it's our cheat night meal.  Our favorite is the Johnny B special which is pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, onions and mushrooms. The sauce is so fresh & tasty. I usually always get the same thing each time especially if it's my favorite. Today, I branched out and also tried a pizza with spinach, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. So delicious!! The crust is crispy & delicious. Overall, I highly recommend this place!
