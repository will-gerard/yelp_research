Apparently this is the only Starbucks in all of Maricopa County that will not add honey to their tea because they are not allowed to open their honey packets per the Maricopa County health inspector who comes in every morning as one of their customers.

I have to begin with the usual guy rant about the smell... It's the usual nail-salon-toxic-kill-brain-cells chemical smell that we guys never understand how women get used to.    BUT  The service is outstanding. All the stylists are super nice. Clearly they've established a great rapport with their customers since they have a large number of return customers. Either that or they're all mind-readers who know everything about everyone who walks in. Hhhmmm.  I decided to get my haircut there while my girlfriend was getting hers cut and colored. Jessica was awesome. Super nice and had great advice. First stylist in 20 years who gave me some good advice on how to style my hair with the cowlick I have.   Thank you, I'll definitely be adding myself to the return customer list.

This was my first time visiting and only my second time having Greek food.  I was a bit apprehensive, but happy to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The service here was prompt, polite, honest and friendly.  I was amazed how quickly everything arrived, but there was definitely no sacrificing quality for speed here, everything tasted amazing.  It was hard to believe everything tasted as good as it did for the price.  I'll definitely be coming back... And soon.
