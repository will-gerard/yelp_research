Value and Food was really good but the service was by far the worst I've experienced.  It is like the place is full of amateurs, our water and drinks were never refilled, ordered food never received and it seems like we were not the only ones who noticed how terrible the service was!!! Def not going back.

We recently had our carpet cleaned and the technicians Travis and Steve  were knowledgeable, kind, courteous, thoughtful and did not try to talk me into services that were unnecessary! I  Everything they did they did well. I will definitely recommend this company in the future to use them for the services that they provide!!  Dean

Where else can you go and have Vietnamese egg rolls, shrimp dynamite sushi with Chinese hot and sour soup and thai fried noodles? And follow that up with house made non-dairy jackfruit and avocado ice cream?    That's what so great about this place! You can create the craziest menu and everyone is satisfied.
