I'm surprised to see so many poor reviews here.  Coffee Rush has always been a favorite place of mine, and I've never had any trouble with the staff.    After just a few visits here, the staff learned my drink preferences.  And when I say "the staff" I mean everyone I've ever ordered from.  Nathan, Stefano, and Bethany just can't be beat at their customer service.  Over the time I've been coming here they've actually taken the time to get to know me a little, and that's refreshing.  If I miss a Monday night, one of them is always quick to point out that I haven't been.  This is only surprising because Coffee Rush seems to have SO MANY regulars; it's wonderful that everyone here really does try to get to know you.  The menu has a lot of really wonderful drinks on it, from lattes to Italian sodas, and more types of tea than you can shake a stick at.  They're always willing to recommend a drink if you're in the mood for something different, and I've never had a bad drink.  My recommendation?  A first-time Rusher should get the black and white (hot, iced, or frost it's delicious).  I'm currently on a chai kick, but I order it with soy instead of milk for a little added flavor.  Delish!  There's not a huge food selection: mostly breakfast pastries and desserts, but it's all good.  They usually have a few different varieties of cheesecake, from the traditional to the utterly decadent.  However, if you're feeling a bit peckish, they won't frown upon you bringing in your own food.  Just don't bring your own drink.  Mondays are double-punch days, so there's extra incentive to go!  They're usually quite busy in the evenings on Mondays, but the staff has always been willing and able to accommodate our relatively large group when we go.  WiFi is available with the purchase of any drink, or you can choose to get a computer code that lets you access the Mac minis in the back.  Codes expire after three hours, which I find to be more than reasonable.  Hours are great--open early in the morning until midnight, with a last call for drinks at 11pm.  The view is stunning, and there's outdoor seating (good for smokers and anyone willing to brave the Arizona heat) and indoor seating to spare.  Most of the one and two-star reviews mention customer service, which I can somewhat understand.  My tip?  Order a drink before you sit down.  It's common courtesy.  Would you sit down in a restaurant for an hour before you were ready to order your meal?  No.  Coffee Rush is usually super busy when I go, so the staff is intent upon making sure everyone has an opportunity to get seated.  If you order a drink, they'll let you loiter for a LONG time.  So...just order a drink and you'll be fine. :)  Coffee Rush is one of the things I will miss most about Arizona if/when I decide to leave.

The mall is not always the best place to find good food, but Wildflower is a hidden gem in the Chandler Fashion Mall, serving up fresh, good food that's moderately priced.  There's something for everyone here no matter what meal you seek--breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and it is all good.  Breakfast is served later on the weekends, but it's worth getting up for on any weekday.  Their frittatas are delicious, but I'm nuts about the toast.  The bread is flavorful, crispy, and chewy all at once.  Just make sure you ask for jam.  It comes in a cute glass container, and the flavors are divine.  Lunch is usually why I come here, and Wildflower never fails to disappoint.  As a vegetarian, coming to a bakery can sometimes be difficult.  Not many places offer veggie-friendly sandwiches that are actually tasty, but Wildflower offers several.  My favorite is the roasted sweet potato, but the portobello picnic is climbing the charts.  They rotate through a seemingly-endless selection of soups, and always offer at least one (though usually 2) vegetarian-friendly soups each day.  My favorite?  The vegetarian black bean.  Hearty, mildly spiced, and served piping hot.  I wish they served it every single day, but even if they aren't, I have half a dozen menu items from which to choose.  I finally had their pasta the other day, and this has proven to be the second-biggest disappointment about this restaurant.  This isn't to say that it was bad!  In comparison to the rest of their stellar food, the pasta was merely satisfactory.  Still filling, and still a masterful medley of flavors and ingredients not often found in food at chain restaurants.  Desserts are rather "eh."  Twice I've had the coconut lemon torte (I think that's what it's called?) and while the flavors blended well, it had the distinct taste that freezer-burned baked goods have, and that was enough to put me off of ever ordering dessert from them again.  Still, the fast, friendly service and excellent breakfast/lunch menu is enough to make me rate this place 4 stars.  Even during the lunch rush I've not had to wait more than a few minutes for my food, though it can be next to impossible to find a table sometimes.

I don't particularly like chain restaurants, but when getting a relatively large family together, sometimes a chain is the only way to go.  California Pizza Kitchen is a frequent choice for our family, as we all have various dietary restrictions that this restaurant can easily accommodate.  The gem (and the drawback) of this place is consistency.  The food is consistently good (not great, but not mediocre).  The service is consistently bad, mediocre on a good day.  Our most recent trip resulted in a dinner mistake that both the server and the manager defended, though it was clear that a mistake had been made.  This is not the first time that I've been on the receiving end of that type of conversation, and it makes me wonder just what makes the staff here so condescending to the needs and requests of customers.  My aunt ordered a pizza Margherita, but asked for sliced tomatoes on top in lieu of the sauce.  If the staff spoke the lingo of New York-style pizza restaurants, she would have ordered a white pizza with sliced tomatoes.  Regardless, she was incredibly clear with the waitress what she wanted, and her order was repeated back verbatim.  The five of us at the table all believed that everyone was on the same page.  However, when the food actually came out, it was clear that our server was not on the same page as our family.  She explained that, upon placing the order for the pizza, that the tomatoes normally on the pizza (a diced variety, supposedly part of a "chunky sauce") WERE the sauce, so she had the kitchen go ahead and make the pizza without tomatoes.  "Was that okay?" she asked, apparently suddenly unsure of her decision as she was just now bringing everyone our food.  First, the decision was contrary to what my aunt had asked for.  She asked for tomatoes, but no sauce.  While the kitchen may put diced tomatoes on this particular pizza, I have ordered varieties of pizza at that very restaurant before with sliced tomatoes (the requested substitution).  I'm not sure why sliced tomatoes were impossible, but they were.  Furthermore, it is up to the server to communicate about substitutions with the kitchen.  It seems that, had she done a bit more probing, she could have had the right pizza brought out the first time.  Second, if the kitchen is somehow completely unable to make that kind of pizza, she should check with the table BEFORE putting the order through.  Her decision to just wait until the order was out left my aunt waiting an additional twenty minutes for another pizza to be made.  Our experience would have been totally different if she had spent 45 seconds checking back in with us to communicate about what our options really were.  When the manager was brought over, he asserted the server's story that the tomatoes are part of the sauce, and because my aunt asked for "tomatoes but no sauce," the kitchen went ahead and made the pizza without the sauce.  Only after a few minutes of discussion did he offer to have the pizza re-made with diced tomatoes.  While they attempted to rectify it by comping the pizza, the damage had been done; our experience had been ruined by our server's decision to not confirm her understanding of my aunt's request.  I wouldn't rate this a two-star restaurant if I hadn't had SEVERAL similar experiences here.  It must be the management, as other CPKs that I've visited throughout the valley are quite good.

I want to like this place, I really do, but every time I come back I am underwhelmed by the experience (at best).  The last two times I've come, I was given free (or close to free - my last "free" tickets included a nearly $3 surcharge) tickets. Given this, my expectations for the quality of the comedy were fairly low. Comedy is hit-or-miss when it's popular, and when a Saturday night show can't sell out it's not a good sign. I say this to emphasize that my review has nothing to do with the comedy - it is 100% about the service.   Tempe Improv, unfortunately, follows an antiquated comedy club model that's hurting them more than it's helping them. On one of my recent visits, my party wasn't given menus - apparently they don't have enough menus for all their tables, and our server was not inclined to get some brought upstairs for us. What ensued was an awkward game of 20 questions with our server to figure out what was on the menu, how much it cost, and whether it would satisfy our two-item minimum. I ended up looking up the menu on my phone  so I could tell what items were vegetarian-friendly (not many).  Our server seemed scatterbrained and hurried, and he frequently forgot basic items we asked for (cups of water, a glass for my boyfriend's bottled beer, refills of bottomless sodas...).   We received menus on our last visit, but they weren't particularly helpful. Only the food has prices, and it is impossible to tell what will and what will not satisfy the two-item minimum. This forces us to engage in another game of 20 questions with the server to determine what we can and should order.  Three of our party ended up ordering bottomless sodas to satisfy the minimum. One of our party ordered two bottled beers. (A note about beer at Tempe improv: they have an extensive mixed-drink menu, but absolutely no beer on tap. Not even shitty domestic beer. That's nearly unacceptable in this day and age.) I didn't want to drink and I wasn't hungry, so the soda was one of my few options.   I was expecting it to be $11, because that's what we paid the last time we came (a Thursday). Nope. It was $15 - plus tax and 15% gratuity (more on that later). My boyfriend's two beers (a far lower profit margin than sugar and water) were $6 each. It's highway robbery to charge $15 for a soda in the first place, but charging 25% more than the beers and 36% more than a 'Thursday soda' really bothered me. It just speaks to how out of touch the Improv is.   The Improv decides to tack 15% gratuity onto every bill, regardless of party size. I assume this is to avoid people tipping the servers based on the quality of the comedy rather than the service, but it's still obnoxious. I tip 20% minimum unless the service is really horrible, so it bothers me when institutions assume I won't tip and charge me for it anyway. That is the fastest way to ensure a minimum (15%) tip from me. If you're that concerned about your servers getting adequately compensated, you should adjust your prices, but don't force me to pay for it regardless of service quality. Our servers both times were adequate (though not stellar), but I would like the ability to adjust my tip down if service is truly horrible.   At the end of the show, we were unable to leave the way we came in. Big, burly men were standing in front of the doors at the back of the theater and telling us to leave through the doors at the front of the room. They routed us through Copper Blues via the exit doors. That move was in incredibly poor taste, given that the owners of the Improv own Copper Blues, too. I already felt taken advantage of at the show ($15 soda, forced tip, bullshit ticket surcharge, no menus, barely adequate service...), and I certainly wasn't about to spend any more money just because they forced me to walk through their bar.   And that's the crux of the issue. The owners of these places (Improv and CB) are so far out of touch with how to run a customer service-oriented business that they're literally driving their customers away. I have no inclination to be fleeced of my money in such shady ways, especially given the quality of the comedy.   They could easily earn my business (comedy notwithstanding) if they posted their prices on EVERYTHING, printed more damn menus, nixed the mandatory tip, and rethought the two-item minimum. I don't think it's necessary. I would happily pay a reasonable cover (~$10) and buy ONE reasonably-priced item (no more $15 sodas - charge $4 like everywhere else), even for mediocre comedy. I can't drink 2 alcoholic beverages in one comedy show, and lots of folks do but shouldn't.  Even if I'm offered "free" tickets in the future, I won't show up. The experience just isn't enjoyable enough to warrant it. It's a shame, because it wouldn't be hard to fix.

This is the best breakfast I've ever had.  Period.  The food was SO good that it totally outweighed the wait outside on a hot day.  Yes, you WILL wait if you come here, but it is absolutely worth it.  The staff here are quite adept at quickly moving people through the restaurant without making anyone feel terribly rushed, and other than your wait to get seated, you won't wait long on anything else.  Most breakfast places excel at one or two things, usually the sweeter side of breakfast (pancakes, waffles, etc).  I don't tend to eat a lot of these, so I'm stuck getting some half-toasted toast, eggs, and potatoes.  Not here.  Here everything on their menu looks good and is even better in execution.  I did end up ordering the toast, eggs, and potatoes, to be fair, but I still can't forget just how good they were.  The toast was a whole-grain variety, thickly sliced, nutty, and perfectly toasted.  It was served with butter and jam, and it was so good that I was reluctant to let my friend try any of it.  The potatoes were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, but both the toast and the potatoes paled in comparison to the eggs.  Yes.  Eggs.  Matt's Big Breakfast earns my nod as the best breakfast joint I've ever patronized because of their eggs.  They were scrambled, but something about them was so mouthwatering that I was disappointed when I finished them.   Most scrambled eggs at other restaurants are served cold, dry, chewy, or any number of other unappetizing ways.  Not at Matt's.  I'm sure they cooked them in butter or something equally as awful for you but, damn, were they ever good.  To this day, nearly a year later, I still have not had better eggs anywhere else.  Believe me, I've tried.  Nothing beats Matt's.  Everything else looked amazing, and they frequently feature specials.  This is the Pizzeria Bianco of breakfast in Phoenix.  Long waits, but a must-attend for each and every Phoenician.

I love Yupha's!  The bottom line: great Thai food at reasonable prices with excellent customer service.  I've been here two or three times in the last couple of months for dinner with one of my best friends.  The last time I went here our server recognized us and said, "I recognize you!  You guys come here often!"  This place is always busy, so it was incredible that our server recognized us as quickly as she did.  Perhaps it's the strangeness of our order - I generally order things just under Thai hot, and she orders things with no spice at all.  I generally order the Pad Thai with an appetizer (often their spring rolls).  They're very conscious of dietary restrictions:  I order my dish with tofu, and they always ask me if egg is okay.  I love that they do that.  I've always found their spice level to be spot-on.  My dishes have the right amount of heat, and my friend never complains about anything being too spicy.  I really appreciate that they trust me when I order my dish hot, but I've also seen them bring out jars of chili flakes and chili oil to patrons who are requesting something a bit spicier.  The portions are perfectly scaled.  If I'm ravenously hungry, I can eat the whole plate without feeling overly full.  If my hunger is at normal levels, I can eat about half the plate and will end up taking the rest home as leftovers.  This place is always busy for dinner, but I've never had to wait to get a table.  The restaurant is spacious and extremely clean.  I never feel like I have to wait long for anything - drinks, someone to take our order, food, or the check.  There are a lot of decent Thai restaurants in Phoenix, but this one is a gem.  If you're craving Thai, come to Yupha's!

I've been meaning to try this place for quite some time with friends, and we were finally able to make it out last night.  Disappointment is a good way to describe the mood of the evening.  I should note that we didn't actually order anything other than water, so this review does not contain anything about the food.  The experience was so unsatisfactory that we decided to leave for another restaurant.  I'm not against trying Yasu again, but I would prefer to go on a different night when perhaps the service would be better.  Upon entering, the strong and distinct smell of bleach attacked our noses.  That was off-putting enough; a restaurant should smell clean, but it should also not smell of cleaning solution, especially one rated as highly as Yasu.  It took a few minutes for the server to notice and seat us, which wasn't bothersome even as slow as the restaurant seemed.  The restaurant itself is incredibly small, with only a few tables and bar seats available.  The kitchen is readily visible from just about any seat in the house, which I find kind of fascinating.  The menu was the first of a few pitfalls.  It is simply a vague list of items, most of which are denoted by their Japanese names.  No descriptions.  I'm used to going to sushi restaurants and needing to ask for descriptions of their rolls,  but I've never been to a restaurant that did not at least attempt to describe their main menu items.  When we told our server that we were still attempting to "decipher" the menu when she came over to take our order (which seemed to take a really long time), she simply said "okay" and walked back to the kitchen.  I wish she had offered to help us decide what to get, but perhaps she was giving us our space.  At any rate, when she returned (after a lengthy chat with the other server working that evening), we had some questions for her.  Now, this is where the evening really started to go downhill.  Whereas both of my friends were able to obtain satisfactory answers as to what was in the menu items that piqued their interest (save the menu of sushi rolls, for which we were only provided descriptions for their five most expensive rolls), I was less than satisfied.    I kindly informed our server that I am a vegetarian, and asked if she could give an overview of what I could order.  She immediately looked to the grill portion of the menu, initially suggesting something with scallops but musing to herself that the bacon probably wouldn't work.  Thank goodness one of my friends piped in and informed her that being vegetarian meant that bacon was not an option, and this is where the server finally seemed to grasp what we were saying.  "As in, just vegetables?"  She sounded surprised that someone would choose to eat "just vegetables" on a daily basis.  At no restaurant have I ever been asked that question before when clearly stating my dietary needs, whether it's a McDonalds or a Fox Concepts Restaurant.  I expected something better from Yasu, which positions itself as a high end sushi restaurant in decor, ambiance, price, and menu selection.  A server should be aware of various dietary needs (not all, but the most popular certainly) and be able to recommend dishes that suit them without missing a beat.  That she could not was off-putting to begin with, but it managed to get worse.  She began hesitantly recommending dishes, but she was totally unsure as to what was actually in them.  A disclaimer on the menu disclosed that many sauces are made with fish oils, nuts, and soy, asking customers to disclose any allergies or dietary needs so the chef can accommodate them.  When pressed about the sauces for this very reason, the server was unable to tell me what was in any of them.  She thought the Japanese eggplant skewer had a flavored soy sauce with it, but had no idea what it was flavored with.  I further disclosed to her that I was allergic to shellfish (I've found that sometimes servers are more serious when dealing with allergies versus dietary "choices" such as vegetarianism or veganism), but that didn't help.  We ended up leaving to go to a restaurant that has a good selection of food for everyone, and we were happier for it.  To me, that level of service is unacceptable, and I haven't even detailed the time that we waited in between each server's visit to our table, but it was significant.  I feel that I should be able to go to a moderately high-end restaurant like this and feel confident that I won't order something that will make me sick.  I'm sure the food is stellar.  I just also happen to have minimum standards for service.

I've been here a few times for both dine-in and take-out, and the gem of this place is its consistency. The food is stellar, and the service is thorough.  Tucked into a generic strip mall in Chandler lies a fabulous escape into Vietnamese cuisine. Anise has a whole book of traditional Vietnamese flavors.  The first time I went here it was with a Vietnamese friend of mine. He walked me through what to expect and helped me select a few things off the menu. I've seem some reviews on here that seem to suggest the flavors here are far from authentic, but I'd have to disagree. My friend brought me to this restaurant precisely because the flavors and dishes are authentic given his extensive experience with traditional Vietnamese cuisine. Perhaps those reviews that say otherwise are used to Phoenix's usual Asian fare, which is usually far from authentic.  The menu is split into several different sections, including one just for vegetarians. The vegetarian dishes are hearty, many containing tofu or nuts as a significant source of protein. It is clear to me that the vegetables are always VERY fresh.   I usually get the crispy rolls and vermicelli, which is a dish that is both light and filling.  I haven't branched out to try anything else off of the extensive vegetarian-friendly menu, but I can say that it all looks delicious.  For meat eaters, Anise has a veritable ton of omnivore-friendly fare, the most popular of which is by far the pho.  The meat appears to be well-incorporated into the dishes, and everyone I've ever come here with compliments the medley of flavors.  Anise has a variety of lunch specials, and their service is fast and thorough.  Haven't had Vietnamese before?  That's okay!  Ask either your server or the owner (she's checked in at my table each time I've been there) for suggestions.  They're always happy to oblige.  Excellent find!  I can't wait to go there again.

In an effort to get away from both the menu and the crowd at RA, I've been sampling various sushi restaurants across the valley with a friend over the last few weeks.  Sushi Brokers was a promising find on Yelp, even if it met the bare minimum of our requirements (3 stars on Yelp, no egregiously bad reviews).  The result was far below expectation.  Upon walking in, Sushi Brokers looks and sounds like an odd hybrid between RA and a standard sports bar.  The hostesses were the highlight of the evening, promptly greeting and seating us at an outdoor table.  Even outside we were barely able to hear one another over the thumping music.  I suppose that's appealing for some, but it detracted greatly from our ability to communicate with one another over dinner.  The vegetarian options at this restaurant were fairly standard for Asian fare.  The only veggie-friendly roll on their extensive sushi menu was a standard veggie roll, a huge disappointment to me.  I've come to expect at least two veggie-friendly rolls on the menu; to find only one was disheartening.  It was happy hour, so all the rolls our group ordered were $4 apiece.  Honestly, even $4 was more than they were worth.  The rolls were small, sloppily assembled, and mediocre in taste.  Furthermore, the veggie rolls were placed on the same plate as rolls containing fish, including one roll containing shellfish.  This is never something I have encountered at any sushi restaurant; while some sushi chefs will combine rolls onto the same plate, they are usually smart enough to separate rolls that indicate obvious dietary restrictions (vegetarian, for example).  Service left a lot to be desired.  While our water glasses were always full, it was next to impossible to track down our server.  When our dessert was brought to our table, mine was incorrect--I had ordered the tempura ice cream, and I was brought plain instead.  The woman who brought it darted away from the table before we could draw her attention to the mistake, and it took close to ten minutes to flag down someone who could.  If you're looking for a Scottsdale feel close to Scottsdale Quarter that isn't RA, I suppose this would fit the bill.  However, it is one sushi bar I will never again feel the need to patronize.

Went here with a friend recently, and cannot wait to go back!  For a nondescript storefront in a forgettable plaza, Yen Sushi & Sake Bar is both charming and memorable.  This is a small location--no more than two dozen tables, plus additional seating at the sushi bar, but it is beautifully decorated and well-staffed.  The menu is a small book!  It took my dining companion and I more than a few minutes to decide on our rolls for the evening.  Based on our experiences with other sushi bars, we each ordered two rolls--he the chicken teriyaki roll and one more 'traditional' roll that I cannot remember, me the veggie roll and the veggie tempura roll.  Soda was served by the can, but was well-chilled and served with a glass of ice.  We were each brought a cup of miso soup to start.  The rolls were well-timed, arriving just as we finished our soup.  There was a LOT of food!  The traditional rolls were large enough, but the chicken teriyaki and veggie tempura rolls each came with a side of what they were made with!  Those rolls alone would have made for a meal.  Quality of the food was excellent.  The veggie tempura roll was warm, all of the ingredients were fresh, and there was no discernible "fishy" flavor that sometimes plagues the seaweed at other restaurants.    The extensive selection of speciality rolls are really where Yen Sushi & Sake Bar shines, and we can't wait to go back and sample some more.  Prices are reasonable; roughly in line what one would expect to pay for sushi outside of Scottsdale.  A must-visit for any sushi fan!

I still say nothing beats Matt's Big Breakfast downtown, but when one doesn't want to wait an hour plus to get seated, there has to be a contingency plan.  U.S. Egg is a great option!  I don't know what's better at this place: the food or the service.  We've always been seated within seconds of walking in, and our servers have been prompt to take our drink and food orders without making us feel rushed.  Another bonus: order iced tea and they bring a whole pitcher of tea out with your first glass!  Order soda and they'll bring two glasses to start, always replacing one when it runs dry.  Water glasses and a water pitcher are brought without being asked, which is nice.  Servers seem well-versed in the menu, and are always happy to make a recommendation or chat about the food if asked.  The first time I came here, I got a skillet, and our server rightfully warned me that it was a LOT of food.  I could barely finish half.  It would be a great dish to share if two people were in the mood to eat the same thing.  On the second visit I decided to mix it up a bit, and I got a pancake plate with eggs and potatoes.  Eggs and potatoes were pretty basic.  They were seasoned well, but certainly not the best I've ever had.  The pancakes, however...  Get the protein pancakes.  I can't emphasize that enough.  Whole wheat pancake batter, granola, almonds, blueberries, cinnamon...these are absolutely divine.  Apparently they now make a protein waffle (that will be my next culinary adventure here), which sounds equally as amazing.  Decor is kitschy, but in a good way.  It feels like you stepped back in time to the 70s.  Honestly, I'm not one to shave points off a rating just because the restaurant is less than aesthetically pleasing, but I don't have the problem with the decor that other reviewers seem to have.  Maybe my kitsch tolerance is much higher than theirs.  U.S. Egg also has a lunch menu as they're open until the early afternoon, but it's not as tempting as the breakfast menu.  Service staff seems happy to let you sit and chat for a while after you're done with your food, which I've found to be most gratifying.  Prices are great, especially for the amount of food that you get.  I'm happy to go here again and again.

I can't get over how rad this place is. From the top down, this place offers an exceptional drinking and dining experience.   Spokes features well over twenty taps of rotating beers from around the country (though most are from the west/southwest). A not insignificant number of taps feature local brews, including beers from Four Peaks. If you like beer and enjoy sampling a lot of different brews, you will LOVE Spokes.   I would love Spokes just for the beer, but their food is even better. If you've never dined here before, you need to start with the grilled cheese. They start with a robust blend of cheeses and allow you to customize it with nearly fifteen different fillings ranging from bacon and tomato to pear and basil. I have never had a better grilled cheese from a restaurant before. My boyfriend fills his with tomato and avocado, while I usually opt for pear, basil, and onion (and sometimes I get adventurous with jalapeño, which they freshly slice in the kitchen). Served with a healthy helping of the most delicious waffle fries, this all-American classic will delight your tastebuds.   Desserts aren't on their menu, but the chef writes them out on a chalkboard on the dining room. There's an area for your little ones, karaoke starting at 9 on Tuesdays, trivia on Mondays, and a super chill vibe every day. The patio overlooks the lake and is dog-friendly.   Ultimately, a bar with great beer and fabulous food is nothing without great customer service. Dave and Scott are two of the bartenders here, and they are some of the best in the business. They clearly love their jobs, and it's fun to chat with them about beer (or anything, really). They're honest about what they like and dislike and are always good for a recommendation if you're not sure what beer to order.  If you're looking for a fab place to hang, drink delicious beer, and get a great meal, look no further than Spokes. You won't be disappointed.

Walked in here excited to try a new pizza place supported by AMAZING reviews. What I saw left me tremendously disappointed. The bottom line: there is too much cross-contamination for people with food restrictions or allergies to eat here safely.  I'm a pescetarian (fish only) and my mom is a vegetarian. We can eat at most places with little trouble. This restaurant would have been impossible.   The quick service build-your-own concept is great. Most places (e.g. Chipotle and Subway) do it well. That's precisely where Fired Pit failed. Everything was done by hand - only the sauce used a utensil. This meant that workers were putting their hands in meat (often covered in sauce) and then putting their hands directly into the veggies (without changing gloves) my mom and I are after. Yuck! We choose not to eat these foods, but the design of this restaurant would force us to come into contact with them.   It's simple to fix this. Employees could change gloves between every customer, and they could use utensils for meat (as Chipotle does) or pre-portion it (as Subway does). Not only would this help standardize serving sizes (reducing overall food costs), it also prevents the very cross-contamination that prompted my mom and I to leave without ordering.  If you have a food allergy of ANY kind, steer clear! Way too much cross contamination. They order gluten-free crusts, but the design of their kitchen leads me to believe that you would likely still come into contact with gluten.   I also watched an employee drop a towel on the ground, shake it off, and go back to using it to wrap around the handle of pizza peels he was shoving into the ovens. While it never came into direct contact with any food, I'm wary of any open-air kitchen that is so cavalier about dropping something on the ground and continuing to use it right in front of customers.   Bottom line: the concept is great, but the execution falls short of what it should.

Eastwind is a delicious Japanese restaurant with a great sushi menu and a fabulous happy hour!  I've been there twice now, and I can say that it's been great both times.  The service is prompt, friendly, and thorough.  I've twice ordered the veggie tempura roll, and both times I was asked if it was okay that there was cream cheese in the roll.  This is actually a great question to ask!  Some vegetarians don't eat cream cheese (or might miss it on the menu), and it's certainly much easier to be informed of that ahead of time than to be disappointed and upset later on.  They actually have a fairly extensive menu for vegetarians.  Vegans would be considerably more limited, but with some creativity, it can be pulled off.  Vegetarian-friendly items can be found in every section of the menu, from apps to sushi, noodles to soups.  Last night I had the veggie tempura roll and the vegetable egg rolls, which my server confidently assured me had no meat in the sauce or roll itself.  Both were delicious!  The egg rolls were so hot that I had to hold off on eating them for a few minutes, but I appreciated the freshness.  Filling was fairly standard for a spring roll, but it had the hearty egg roll exterior that I've missed for so long.  The sweet and sour sauce was different, but really quite good.  The veggie tempura roll was thinly sliced, slightly warm, crispy, and tender all at once.  One of my favorite rolls at any restaurant, and it's reasonably priced, too!  My friends enjoyed their dishes--one got a roll, the other a noodle dish.  The restaurant overall seems very accommodating to various needs and requests.  When my friend who ordered the noodles asked if the spice could be toned down a bit (the last time he got the dish it was much too spicy for his taste), the server said it could, and then explained how the spice would be toned down and how the flavor would be altered.  The result was apparently quite good.  I'm a fan of their happy hour, but it looks like they have some decent lunch specials, too.   A must-go if you like Japanese cuisine!
