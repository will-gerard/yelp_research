It doesn't look like much from outside, but the food is gourmet and delicious. I've tried many things on the menu and liked all of it. My favorite thing by far is the buffalo chicken sandwich. Pay the extra to get it with onion rings. My parents always request to go here when they are in town visiting. Great place to watch games and not get your typical bar food. They would get 5 stars if they had better service. Nothing terrible, but have to wait awhile sometimes.

I was very happy to see that Hillstone is not much different than Houston's. I had been wanting to try this place since I have been watching it being built!  The actual building is really cool. Great outdoor seating area but you cannot order dinner outside.  I had the veggie burger, and it was the best veggie burger I have ever had.   I would've given this review 5 stars if our total time at the restaurant was not over 3 hours - it gets very crowded on Saturday nights.

I can't believe I waited so long to try this gem in my backyard. Slice of Sicily blows any pizza chain out of the water! Friendly service too, and love that it's locally owned. I had the white pizza and it was delicious. No skimping on cheese here. The crust was perfect. We also ordered the garlic twists. I think next time I would just go with the pizza. I will definitely be back and looking forward to trying some of the lunch specials.

Only got take out from here. I will have to try dining in. The food was delicious and ready fast. We ordered lemon chicken, beef fried rice, and egg rolls. All of it was delicious and reasonably priced. Portions were big too so leftovers for lunch!

Very Yummy BBQ here. You can smell it from the parking lot. It is in the middle of the neighborhood, but don't doubt it! You get mini donuts at the end of your meal.

I can't wait to come back here. Everything I had was delicious. My favorite part might be the pesto sauce for dipping...  We had brushetta, the soup (it was something with cauliflower in it), the proscuitto flat bread, and the gnocchi. All of it was so good, I can't pick a favorite. They also have a great wine list. Our serve was fantastic, attentive, and had great suggestions for us.

I've been going to Vig for years now. The food is tasty, the service is good, and the vibe is perfect. A very nice place to relax and meet friends. It's great in the fall and spring on the patio. We also like going on Sunday for 1/2 price bottles of wine.

This was the weirdest dental experience I have had. I felt like all the Dr. Steen did was try to sell me services I did not need.  Having been to a different dentist about 8 months prior, I was told I had no cavities.  Dr. Steen insisted I had 6 that all needed immediate action.  I was also told I should consider braces - I had braces for 3 years in my teenage years and find it hard to believe my teeth are that messed up.  What really got me  was at the end of my new patient appointment a woman, a "closer", came and took me to her office where she sat me down and gave me a print out of what services I needed and what the insurance would cover.  The difference was around $700, and I cannot believe these services were all necessary.    He may be a good dentist, but it was too salesmen like for me. I just want my teeth cleaned.

I LOVE this place. It is my go-to place to take anyone new in town. Great service, great food, and great drinks. Don't forget to ask about the special.

I had to give this review based on the experience I had last Sunday during brunch. If Ramon is your server you should immediately ask for someone else. After rudely being told we'd have to wait for coffee because it was still brewing, he walked away as I asked what the breakfast special was. He definitely heard me. When he finally brought our coffees, he dropped the cream on the floor and it got all over my feet. I understand mistakes happen, but he did not apologize. Muttered "shit" and went to get a rag. He wiped up the floor but did not offer me any napkins for my feet. We then ordered food. We waited an hour for our food to come out. The table of 6 next to us, who ordered after us, was served before us. I'm pretty confidant he forgot to put our order in. The food was delicious & fantastic, up to Switch's standards. The service was not. I did speak to a manager who offered to take our coffees off the bill. Then I went home and had to wash my feet and sandals from the spilled cream. All could have been fixed with a simple apology & some napkins.  I previously loved everything about this place. I hope to go back and have a better experience like my previous ones.

True Food is a healthy alternative to your typical restaurant. The Kale salad is amazing! I didn't think I would like kale. Also amazing are the Spaghetti Squash Casserole and the Turkey Pita. They also have a large variety of specialty sodas in addition to beer and wine. The staff is very knowledgeable on all food too.

A nice casual breakfast spot. Food was tasty and even though there was a line out the door, it moved fast. We did have to sit outside because the tables inside were full. Only disadvantages to note: it's serve yourself/cafeteria style. You have to get your own silverware, condiments and drinks. 2nd is they do not have any alcohol so you can't get your Sunday mimosa or Bloody Mary here.

Fun place for lunch, happy hour, or dinner. On Wednesday's they have all night happy hour. The signature cocktails are fun & come in cool tiki glasses. Great location off the light rail, but still plenty of parking in the lot. It's fun to get the Volcano bowl when you have a group. I've only ever had the chicken sandwich as I am not much of a seafood fan, but it's good chicken. Someone else in my group ordered the butter fish and said it was the best fish they've had. I have only been to brunch here once and it was a long time ago - will need to try that again soon.

I've been going here since they opened. I love that it's getting more popular and I have to wait for a table now.   OHSO has an amazing vibe: chill, relaxed, local, friendly. The changing beer selection makes it fun to come back. The food is delicious. My favorite item is the Arcadia Veggie Burger.   Their brunch includes a mimosa or beer. The mimosa is made with fresh OJ and is so good! I honestly can't pick a favorite breakfast item because they are all good. Top 2: Breakfast wrap or Chicken & the Egg.

I've been here 3 times now, and every time has been excellent. They have a great wine selection, and great happy hour prices! I've had the orecchiette pasta each time and it hasn't disappointed. The sauce is so good! My boyfriend has had the steak and lamb burger and liked both. The service is great, and it never takes a long time to get our food.

The two stars are for the food. Because there was nothing wrong with it and it came out fast. However everything else was slow. I did not get to order another drink during my whole meal. My friend never had his diet coke refilled the entire time. We had to ask the waiter for everything numerous times. My other friend finally walked up to the bar to order his drink. The food was average, nothing spectacular and kind of pricey for what it is. Service is incredibly slow and it was not busy- empty tables everywhere.

I'd been wanting to try this place, and I can't believe I waited so long! It was absolutely delicious! I got the Thai Spring Rolls and the spicy peanut dipping sauce was amazing. So flavorful! I had the Hot & Sour soup (veggie) for my entree and I was surprised at how filling it actually was. It is the BEST hot & sour soup I have ever had. If I go back, I will definitely order this again. All of the tapas sounded great and I can't wait to try more. My friends had the potstickers and wings and were also impressed at the taste. The service was great too! Our server let me know that almost all of the entrees can be made vegetarian if not vegan.

This location is so cool! I love the decor and concept of the restaurant. The menu is pretty small, but the tacos are good. I had the short rib & the chicken, with a side of corn. The corn was delicious and so was the chicken taco. I will skip the short rib next time. Service was great, and so were the different hot sauces to try.

Love having a new brunch spot, especially with mimosas on tap! There were a lot of things on the menu that looked good, so I will definitely be back. I had the breakfast burrito this time with half red/half green sauce. It was a ton of food, and I could only eat half of it. The service was great, but there was a long wait to be seated. There is complimentary coffee while you wait, and they'll text you when your table is ready if you want to wander around Nordstrom Rack.

I love this place! I am so glad I found it via Groupon. Since the Groupon, we have been back 3 more times. The owner always has good recommendations on the wine (selection changes). I've liked everything I have tried, and the owner will also let you taste something before you order. The service is excellent, I feel like every time I look up to contemplate ordering my next drink, there he is! There's no food, but the brownies are good - the peanut butter especially. My only complaint is that it is tiny. It can be hard to find seats on a Friday night. We have gone on Wed & Thurs and not had a problem though. I will keep coming back to this spot as long as it's here!

This is the best place to go for a spray tan in Phoenix! Very cute studio, and I felt like Jayd was as dedicated to my tan as I was. I've been spray tanned before and I did not get the detailed instructions for before and aftercare. Jayd made sure I understood everything and made recommendations to me. My tan is not streaky or uneven, it's absolutely perfect 2 days later!
