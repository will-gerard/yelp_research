Pablo is the man!  I'm sure everyone there does a great job, but I had the pleasure of working with him.  He listened to me and what I wanted.  AND it was like talking to an old friend.  It was a very comfortable visit.  Everyone was super duper nice.  They even stayed late for me when I was late getting off work.  I have passed out all of his cards to my friends after they all loved my new color.  I'm so happy I went to see him.  Don't miss out on this great salon!

I love the creative flavors that G spot has, but what it has is creativity it lacks in customer service. I came tonight and there was one family in front of us and two workers. The free worker thought it was more important to fill the water pitcher than to take our order out even so much as acknowledge us. G spot is definatly losing the customer service battle to Frost down the road. At Frost they treat me like they want me to return instead of being annoyed that I'm holding up the water refill.

I've been coming to frances for a while now. They've got great products and they love the local community! But, today was exceptional! We thought the store opened at 10, but on Sunday they open at 12. We got to the shop at 11:45 and noticed it was closed. I exclaimed to my husband "Matt, they're closed!" And an employee heard me. She turned and said "give me a couple minutes, I'll count the money and open early for you". How great was she?!

Terrible! Today was the 4th, yes 4th time they have messed up my order. 1st, they forgot my sandwich, 2nd they sent my sandwich to the drive thru, 3rd they sent my iced coffee to the drive thru, and a day later (!) They forgot to make my coffee altogether. Mind you, the last time I was the ONLY person in line. How is that even possible. I can't tell you how many free drinks I've gotten out of this location. These most recent 4 issues are just in the past month. There are many more I could go in to, but I don't have the time or energy to start. If you can put up with the service, then I would say go there to just get free drinks!

Chris the manager is a d-bag. He was rude when I asked why my hold sticker was removed. He kept going on and on about his policies. I explained that one of his workers said it would be held until 4pm. He said that "wasn't policy" but that's not my problem! Apparently he has a problem with his staff following policy. He should honor what was told to me regardless of policy. Then he bad mouthed me to another staff member bc he thought I couldn't hear him! We also heard him bad mouth a women who called for directions. If you want to talk to someone helpful ask for the other manager Jamie. He's very nice.

Great food! Our waitress was pretty friendly, but slow on being attentive. I ordered the apricot bbq chicken and it was really good. The place seemed to draw an older crowd, but we didn't mind!

I've only had the Arizona bowl and crunch till, but they are both excellent. Service can be a little slow at lunch during the week, but other than they it's a great place.

The waitress sucks. She's super rude. Don't let her wait on u. On my friends 1st visit she ordered a Malibu and rum. The waitress scoffed and said "this is a brewery not a bar, honey..." RUDE!  It was her 1st time and she was actually embarrassed by the comment.  She probably won't be going back.  Then we got yelled at b/c we stood at the game table too long. I can't say enough to describe how bad the service is.  When I asked for the manager the guy said he was "sort of a manager".  I told him of our problem with the waitress and I'm guessing he passed along the message b/c for the rest of the night she gave me the dirtiest looks from across the bar.

Lola isn't the coffee shop I visit most often (mostly because they don't stay open late) but they do have my favorite drink, The Matador. Often imitated, but never as good, The Matador is truly delicious. I wish they stayed open later than 7...it's such a bummer they don't.

I took my music-freak husband here for his birthday. Needless to say, he was very happy. But, I felt like a bad wife since I didn't realize how much time should be given to this museum! We spent 6 hours here and he didn't get to enjoy the live experience and we had to rush through the Europe and N. American exhibits. Word to the wise, if you want to get your money's worth give yourself 8 hours, wear comfortable shoes (seriously, don't neglect to do this), and leave the kids at home. All the young kids we saw were miserable. You might want to give some thought to the route you take as well--we didn't, and we should have. We started in Africa and ended in Europe. Should have been the other way around for us...you can only see so many instruments made out of trash findings before you get the musical inclinations of tribal Africa...  And, beware of the elderly not realizing how headphones work. It was pretty entertaining to see many older people yelling at each other because they are talking over what is in their ear! I heard plenty of awkward interjections as we strolled along each exhibit. Hilarious!

I've had a membership to the joint of over a year now and I get regular adjustments.  I suffer from migraines and the regular adjustments help me so much.  I also had a really bad car wreck with I was 16 that left me with whiplash.  It flares up every so often and regular adjustments have helped me keep that under control.  Now, I'm pregnant and I'm having extreme pain in my pelvic area.  I'm talking pain so bad that it takes my breath away and I can't walk!  My walk today was reduced to a shuffle.  I went in for relief and Jim gave me a fantastic adjustment!  I was able to walk out of the office at a normal pace with no pain!  I'm so grateful to the care I've received from all the joint docs I've seen across the valley/state/country.  I've been able to use my membership as far away as Austin, TX!  The joint truly is a lifesaver.

I love their late hours! My night was almost ruined until someone said churn stayed open later than other shops. We got there just before the last min rush. It was crazy how many people line up, into the parking lot, 10 minutes before closing. It's that good! The staff are always friendly too.

I went here with my husband for brunch. We ordered the chilaquiles and biscuits and gravy with coffee. The food was good and the coffee was particularly good. Our friend joined us shortly after our food arrived and also ordered chilaquiles. This shouldn't have been an issue since our food came out quickly. But, after 35 min of waiting he canceled his order. Apparently the waitress put the order in, but the cook overlooked it.

Great food, but for goodness sake, GET SOME BLINDS! When the sun is setting it's like an ant sitting directly under a little boys magnifying glass. I see patrons trying to hold on to any bit of shadow available to shield their eyes. It's horrible!

This place is crazy amazing. I brought my aunt here while she was visiting from out of town. I took a risk since it was also my first time. We were not disappointed! The pizza was awesome and the salad was a generous size. For the three of us the pizza and salad were enough. The owner then came over and sneakily left a dessert that tasted like a funnel cake in chip form! THEN he brought over a bottle of homemade lemoncello (sp?). It was so good (and strong). Free booze and great pizza makes for a 5 star review.

Much improved customer service since my first visit. The staff was fast and friendly. I like the fact that the smoothies/good are healthy and affordable. I wish they had a smaller size option, but it's not a big deal.

Great atmosphere! I went on a Friday night and it was jam packed. It was a lot of fun and they have several fun games to keep you entertained including old video games from your childhood

Tonight would have been my first time at Clever Koi. But, too bad they failed to let anyone know their kitchen closes at 10. The hours listed say they close at 11. After standing at the hostess desk for an uncomfortably long time a women informs us that we cannot be seen. Why would something like this not be common knowledge?! What a bummer.
