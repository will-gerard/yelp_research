Very good sushi. The dragon roll is my favorite. The only thing need to improve is their service. The attitude is great and patient. But they do not have enough waiters! Take us 5 minutes to order and wait long time for the check

We ordered the all u can eat Sushi, which means we can order whatever we want to eat. However they intentionally slow to make the food. When we ask why it was so slow they were really rude. It took us 2 hour and half just for 3 sushi roll. When we pay, they add 20 percent tip!!! Never go again

great place for the great location. I always go there after shopping and movie. The service is much better than the other one on mills ave. There is a fat girl there always go out for 20 minutes break and close the store. But actually it take at least half hour for her to come back! Wasted a lot of our time. So we changed to this location

I have a big company moving so they arranged 3 people larry john b and Adrian.  These guys really come on time. And they did a good package job. The only thing I want to share with other people who looking for moving company is that we really need to plan before moving. Otherwise when I unload the stuff. I do not even know where to unload. But luckily, these guys are friendly and patient. :)

Always my favorite place. Come here almost every week. Their food is real north china Chinese food. Same as my hometown flavor. The service is great. The stir fry pork neck bones and minced pork with vermicelli are my most favorite :)

Very poor service. I try to order a pick up by the phone. And the they told me to wait for a second for the answer. Then there is no voice or respond from the other side for 4 minutes. I tried to hang up and recall. It always busy signal from the other side. !!!!
