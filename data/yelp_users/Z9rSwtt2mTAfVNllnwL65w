What do you get when you mix a ton of big screen tv's with sports, beautiful women, great and ice cold beer? Twin Peaks- honestly i've been to so many sports bars and beer bars and for me what sets the place apart is great service, great spirit and great food and if that isn't enough the beer is always ice ice cold 29 degrees to be exact

I was excited to see Los Taquitos at Sky Harbor Terminal 4 I been going to the location off 16th street for a long time and I am a big fan of their tacos and homemade salsas.  I even saw a sign on the wall last time I was in the 16th st restaurant talking about opening in Terminal 4  This is nothing like the restaurant this is different from top to bottom and disappointing to say the least  The other reviews and pictures are spot on so I won't bother posting more very very disappointed
