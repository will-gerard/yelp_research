The Food is absolute perfection!! Real authentic pizza and you can't beat the garlic knots!  Must have cannolis only available on Wednesdays right now.  I can't decide is this place reminds me of New York or Italy, but either way, I'm a happy girl that they have come to Anthem!

We have tried to eat here twice now and both times left before we even got in.  They clearly don't have enough staff and the staff they do have, at least the hostess and manager at front, didn't appear to be trained.  They grossly mis estimated the wait time.  Not sure if we will make a 3 rd attempt until they get it figured out.
