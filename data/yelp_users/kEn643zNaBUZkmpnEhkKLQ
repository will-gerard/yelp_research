Stallone with the earrings is good to look at but not as good as these croutons in my Caesar salad. The food is delicious and Kim Crawford coming in clutch with the Sav blanc..

This place sucks. The service is terrible. I had an apt at 1 o'clock with my mother and sister. We didn't get in until 1:30. My sister and I were finished with a pedicure and gel manicure at 2:30 while our mother sat with pruned feet in cold water for 90 minutes before they started on her pedicure.   I personally got a gel manicure. My nails are rough and not smooth at all. The ends of my nails are chipped from the poor technique she used. She didn't soak my nails in warm water and solution, cut my cuticles dry, didn't use any lotion and was running around finishing other people's services in the middle of my service. Very disappointed with the establishment. Won't be returning. It's not worth the hour wait even with your appointment!
