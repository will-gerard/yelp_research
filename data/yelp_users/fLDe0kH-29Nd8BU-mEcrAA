I have left three messages for this company and they have not returned my calls.  I was trying to get them out to repair stucco damage to a client's home before the rain comes.  Too late.  The rain came and now I have an angry client, and so does Phoenix Plastering.  Don't waste your time.  Unless you get lucky and catch these people passing by their phone, they're not going to return your calls.

Wow!  This place is amazing.  My wife and I have gone to lots of spray tan salons around the valley, but this one is the BEST!  We just found them by accident, but are glad we did.  The tan we selected was the Rapid Developing.  It was fast, easy, and has lasted for a long time.  The thing I am usually worried about is that the spray tan LOOKS like a spray tan.  This one does not.  I could not be happier, and will be back again, and again.  Thank you Arizona Airbrush Studio!

Had my first lunch here today and it was wonderful.  From the friendly hostess and the efficient waitress, to the delicious lunch, it could not have gone better.  I loved the pork al pastor pad thai, and also got a taste of the tamarind shrimp.  Both were excellent, and the temperature was perfect.  The other three people at my table also thoroughly enjoyed their lunch, and none of them had been here either.  The only thing I would change was the loud music at lunch which made it a little more difficult to have a business meeting.  Nobody else complained about the volume, so it may just be me.  It sucks getting old.  It's certainly not for sissies.

We have recommended Larry to many of our clients and have never heard a negative comment from any of them.  We have always received glowing comments from them about how friendly, efficient, fair, and careful he is when inspecting a home.  We have also personally used Larry as a home inspector and know him to be all of that and more.  If you want a home inspector who is reliable, dependable, and extremely good at inspecting a home, call Arizona Superior Home Inspection.  You will be happy you did!
