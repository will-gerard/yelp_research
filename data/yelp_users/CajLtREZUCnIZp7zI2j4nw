I go to Targets in different cities expecting to find something different or new.  Nope.  All Targets are exactly the same.

I flew in on a Monday afternoon.  No issues with baggage claim or shuttle to the rental car station.  Overall, it was a pretty straight forward airport and not confusing to follow directions to the gates.

I'm from Texas and was looking for souvenirs.  When I called ahead, the clerk informed me they had a few next to one of the aisle.  She wasn't exaggerating.  I only found a few items.  The store was very clean and organized.

First restaurant I tried in Phoenix/Scottsdale area. It was really good. The layout and atmosphere went along great with the food. Definitely would recommend this place.

Gross place. I had to wash my hands as soon as I walked out. Clothes, purses and shoes looked worn. No joke.  My daughter bought Steve Madden heels for 18.99 but they looked worn on the bottom. Since she's barely learning to wear heels it wasn't a big deal.  What a waste of time.

Great for tourist that don't want to climb but want to take pictures. It looks like you climbed so high but it's from the actual drive up. It's literally a 5 min walk to the rock from the parking lot.

Just like the ones back home in Houston. It's located next to Starbucks. Clerks that was working on Wednesday morning was nice.

Sold 4 stars for its trendy look. Sold 3 for prices, food and premium seats. The seats were very straight for my back but I like that they were wide.  It located inside the square. In front of Its Sugar.

Typical Premium outlet. They looked just like the ones in Houston. They have misters and a SMALL covered parking area.

The placed was packed for a Tuesday night, but it isn't that huge either.  I decided to order to go instead.  I order the Margherita pizza and it was ready less that 10 minutes.
