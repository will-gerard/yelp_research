Awful service! I took my mom to this place recently. We were seated promptly and that was the only prompt service we received after that. A server NEVER came to greet us or take our order. After about 15 min or so I approached the host who seated us if the waiter could please come by our table to take our order and we waited and waited....we eventually just left.  Never again will I be back.

This place is fantastic! Great service, adorable patio and the food was phenomenal! Pasta is homemade...I particularly enjoyed the gnocchi.

I really like Federal Pizza. They always play great music and have a fun atmosphere. The service is great but the star of the show is their food. Any place that has homemade pasta holds a special place in my heart.
