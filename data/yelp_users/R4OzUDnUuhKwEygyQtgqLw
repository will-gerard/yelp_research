We went during happy hour, needless say, service was awful. Servers and the two managers were playing on their phones. My wife's mushroom swiss burger was OK, the mushrooms and red onions were still raw.  When leaving the hostess was too busy on her phone to say bye to us! Really, I had great expectations after seeing this chain on undercover boss. He's needs go undercover here!

It's across the street from my house. I love it. I take my daughter there with me, she loves seeing all the dogs. :) Great spot.
