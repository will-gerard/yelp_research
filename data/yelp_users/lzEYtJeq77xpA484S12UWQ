Definitely a true hole-in-the-wall Mexican food joint with the classic washed out pictures of what you are going to be eating on the menu board. I ordered the 4 rolled tacos with guac and had a great meal overall.  Expect large portions, good prices and authentic offerings.  With a good Mexican cerveza the experience would have been even better (I guess I have to go for take-out next time to get the cerveza myself)

I purchased a small case for my compact camera from Ritz Camera 15 days ago, after limited use over that two week period the Lowepro brand case had the stitching ripping out of one of the pieces of Velcro; probably a manufacturing defect that I was not upset about at all I took the item back into Ritz with the receipt and they prompted to tell me they would not exchange the item without all its original packaging, which I did not keep. I asked to speak with the manager, didn't catch a name but he had a long brown pony tail, and he proceeded to tell me the same thing and continued that he would take the item back but he would have to charge me a 25% restocking fee. The ridiculous part was that I was actually going to purchase another item at the store at the same time, and proceeded to tell him that I would not be buying that item nor anything else again at a Ritz Camera ever again.  My suggestion is to bring your business to any other local retail camera seller and avoid Ritz Camera otherwise you will probably end up paying more than other retailers and getting absolutely horrible customer service if anything goes wrong.

La Bocca is a great spot for pizza and wine, probably my favorite in the valley. Tonight was my third time and I enjoyed a margarita pizza with a glass of Russian Jack Pinot for half price before 630pm. The wine was very smooth to drink and an overall well rounded Pinot Noir - highly recommended. The pizza could have used a little more cheese in my opinion tonight, but all in all it suited what I was looking for in a great quick and light dinner.
