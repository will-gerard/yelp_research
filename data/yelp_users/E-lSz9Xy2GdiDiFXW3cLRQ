Got a #10 spicy green papaya salad here and SHE-YI-IT!!! It was the hottest thai dish I have ever had. Just loaded with fresh green and red Thai peppers. Ate the entire thing! And felt it burning holes in my stomach lining for the next 6 hours. So good!  Lots of veg items and lots of locals eating here.

I will give TeePee a couple of stars for having lardless beans and for the weird old-school style of the place (it is a serious throw back to a time that no longer exists), BUT i ordered (in my pre-vegan era) the "famous" chiles rellenos and what i got made me want to gag... what they have created is a green chile, flattened, and then covered in some terrible meringue! how in the hell is that a chile relleno?!?  "Relleno" means "Stuffed" in Spanish, not topped with French meringue!! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile_relleno then they put some shredded iceberg on top and give you a side of some sort of mysterious red "sauce" that you are supposed to use as a topping.  I am a native Tucsonan who has been eating Texan, Arizonan, New Mexican, Californian and Sonoran Mexican chiles rellenos my entire life and can honestly say these are the worst I've ever had.   this is what Chiles Rellenos normally look like: http://www.roadfood.com/photos/7510.jpg  this is what you get at TeePee: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1116/862689844_54188a24a1.jpg?v=0  trust me on this one. don't go here for the food. go here to smoke cigarettes, wear copper and purple colored clothing, and drive home in a much much too big car.  I think i ate a Cliff Bar instead.

Whadda dump! Dude, I fully expect a semi-awesome room (even if it is super basic) when on the strip in one of the big hotels.... but this aint it!  Getting to the check-in desk from the garage is HELL.  The casino is dingy.  Reserved a non-smoking room only to be given a smoking room and was told there is no guarantee for such a request even though it was available when we made the reservation.  Bathroom looked like it was for an army barrack.  Too close to the garage where we heard car alarms going off all night.  No free wireless access or coffee maker (I guess this is standard in Vegas, but it fucking sucks balls.)  We stayed in the "Capri Building" and maybe that was the problem, but damn... the night previous we stayed in the Stratosphere for much less and it was a palace in comparison.  Overall, this place was a serious bummer.

two stars for being so vegan. negative three stars for bad food.   this "EBT" eggplant sandwich people are talking about came with an abundance of wet, undercooked, hard to chew, poorly spiced eggplant. basically had to dump out all the eggplant and just eat a tomato sandwich. ugh.  the biscuits and gravy were better, but still under spiced and not served hot. gravy is too important in this world to be served cold.   hash browns were so small and stringy that they didn't really have a bite, just grease and an excuse to eat ketchup... and these were the best part of our meal.  wanted pie, but naw. not this time. don't know if i'll ever be back though.   sucks, cuz i really wanted to love this place.
