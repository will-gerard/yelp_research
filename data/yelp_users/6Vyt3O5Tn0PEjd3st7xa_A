i'm usually just a tag-along when my bf shops here, but the staff is really cool and helpful (Eddie especially).  They have a great selection that is well organized, and the location is really convenient.  i like their personal recommendations, etc.  i've actually gotten into a few comics myself, after wandering around a bit while the bf shops! :P

very disappointed in their customer service.  i've used them for my internet for over 2 years now, and never had ANY serious issues,... until i moved.  apparently, they cannot handle people who move to a different apartment within the same apartment complex.   first, i tried to schedule the change of service online (which was a pain in the ass, given that their site isn't set up to handle these requests AT ALL), only to get a "cancellation" email the next day.  i called the customer service number listed in the email, only to find out that they needed to "research" my situation and would get back to me.  well, they did,... around 7 that night.  they told me everything was set up and i was good to go and that my service would be switched over when i moved in two weeks.  i kid you not, 20 minutes later, i lose my internet connection. so, AGAIN, i call their customer service line.  I finally get connected with someone in their tech support area who claims that there must have been some sort of "mix up" and explains that who ever had been helping me had shut off my service in my current apartment right then and there.  he fixes it.  he tells me that I, THE CUSTOMER, will have to call them the day that i move to "remind them" to change over the service.   2 weeks later, i'm all moved in and i give them a call... they have everything up and running immediately.  i find it funny that they charged me 20 bucks for this, btw.  everything is ok until about a week later, when i spontaneously lose service again.  so, i put in ANOTHER call.  THIS TIME, not only do i apparently have TWO accounts, but my modem wasn't registered in their system anymore.  why is transferring of service so difficult for them????  so again, mister tech-guy goes in and fixes it, after i read him a bunch of serial numbers, etc.  so i think, FINALLY, this is done,... right?  WRONG.  i get my bill. 85 bucks.  49.99 for the service, 19.99 for a "self installation fee" (aka bullshit charge), and 15.00 bucks for a "partial month' of service (aka another bullshit charge).   there WAS NO PARTIAL MONTH.  so i end up having to call on this twice.  the first time, they swear to me that this charge was removed and that the paper bill that i was referencing was not current and that it wouldn't show on my online bill.  when i go to log in and the charge is still there online, i give them YET ANOTHER call to get YET ANOTHER answer.  apparently, even though i paid in full the month before and they're billing me for part of a cycle that hasn't even completed, AND there was no overlap in service between the two addresses, they still have to charge me the extra 15 bucks this month... only to give me a credit next month.  how about THIS, dip-shits... if i'm calling to complain about your stupid charges,... how about you just freaking REMOVE them?  i think i've just about had it with this.  your website sucks, your customer service sucks, and your bullshit fees suck.  why the hell do you put your loyal customers through this crap?!?!?

i frequent this location every weekend.  their produce is always well-stocked and organized.  the staff is pretty friendly.  i love that they have crumbled feta packaged by weight at their deli... way cheaper than other stores, in my opinion.  not a huge assortment of frozen foods, but that's kind of a good thing, right? ;)

i love this theater.  usually quiet in the AM if you like to take advantage of their $5 before noon promotion.  they validate parking and the staff is normally pretty nice.  my bf and i will normally hit up an early movie, then stick around and grab lunch at one of the restaurants near by.

i really enjoyed this place.  not a ton of seating, but definitely more spacious than your typical sandwich spot.  had the chicken salad.  on a scale of 1-10, i'd give it an 8.  really enjoyed the decor and "chill" atmosphere.  will definitely return!
