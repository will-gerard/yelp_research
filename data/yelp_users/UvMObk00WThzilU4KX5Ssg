We went for Sunday brunch. Atmosphere is great. But we waited 30 minutes until we had to call a server over to get our drink order and there were only 5 other tables. Food was good but not worth the wait.

Delish! Coming from a foodie. Unique food and amazing drinks. Atmosphere is not what I expected from a sports bar, it's so much more. Family oriented as well, brought the kiddos, they played while we enjoyed ourselves with friends!

I'm a picky pizza eater. I'm a huge NJ pizza gal, I wouldn't compare it to jersey pizza, but wow it was tasty. My friend and I shared the small house salad which was no ordinary salad, mushrooms, tomatoes, roasted red peppers, olives with an amazing Italian dressing. I could've had that as a meal myself with a protein.  We ordered the veggie pizza and added ricotta. This was a basil pesto sauce, I'm usually a red sauce girl....so pleasantly surprised when I ate my entire half. When my friend didn't finish hers bc she was stuffed, the owner asked if we wanted it boxed, she said no, I said hold on sister I'm having that for dinner. That good! So our kids were at another table, they ordered pasta and pepperoni pizza, my son said 2nd best pizza he's ever had. He's used to Jersey style, so high compliments. Also they brought out dough for the kids to play with...bonus! They ended it with the pizookie, huge hot chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. I'm done... Delish!
