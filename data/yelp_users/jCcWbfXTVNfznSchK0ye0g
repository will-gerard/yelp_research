We went to this Verizon store to switch our service from Sprint and to get new phones. This is  a process that I usually dread because often employees can be condescending and less than patient with us from the baby boomer generation who aren't  as tech savvy as they are. But I never felt this way at this Verizon store. We were warmly greeted and checked in. After a short wait, we were helped by Khloe. She was patient, kind and efficient. My new iPhone had to be ordered. When it came in I went back to Verizon to have it activated and set up. I asked specifically for Khloe. Again she was very friendly and knowledgeable and made the normally dreaded experience a pleasant one!

I like this small family owned business. They take walk-ins or appointments. I went in for a pedicure after seeing the sign out front advertising them for 19.99. The salon was clean and they were kind & friendly. They had the usual massage chairs and had all of the polish colors.  They are only 1 1/2 miles from my house. For the convenience and price, they can't be beat!

I'm a sucker for home mailer coupons so I decided to try this salon for a discounted "spa pedicure". My first impression was that it looked a little rundown and not too clean. I was immediately led to a massage chair which looked worn. There was one other customer getting a pedicure when I arrived. The woman who sat down to do my pedicure was pissed off and seemed sick. Yikes! I wanted to leave but she already had my feet soaking in (lukewarm) water (no liner). I wasn't given a menu of pedicure options. She barely looked up at me and just slapped my legs whenever she needed me to move. She coughed into her arm and looked miserable. She also spent most of the time looking angry and yelling in another language at the man who worked there. They were clearly arguing. She rushed through my pedicure and was looking away most of the time. Instead of the relaxing experience, I was stressed out, afraid that she was going to cut me with the nail clippers! The polish was done sloppily and the nails weren't cut straight. She rolled her chair over to work on someone else without even looking at me to acknowledge that she was done. After several awkward minutes I started to get up from the chair. She yelled-"no move!!" Then a sullen young man (teenager?) who'd been standing around came over to put my flip flops on my feet. I walked to the front with him and he stood in front of the register without saying anything. I handed him the coupon and money. No one looked at me or said thanks for coming.  That's what I get for trying to save a few bucks! From now on I'll go to my usual place across the street.

I went to this Queen's Nails for a pedicure because I had a coupon and thought I'd give it a try. I went on a slow Tues afternoon and there was only one other client there. They took me right away.  The positives: they had my favorite OPI polish and my pedicure looks good. The usual comfortable massage chair.  The negatives: Divorce Court blasting on the little tv on the wall. And the 3 employees loudly talking back and forth to each in their native tongue the whole time.  If you're looking for a calm, relaxing salon experience, this was not it.  Forget the coupon, I'll go elsewhere next time.

We've been bringing our dog here for medical care for almost 4 years. The staff is kind, caring and professional. Dr. Warley offers various treatment options and suggestions to us and calls to checkup on how our senior dog is doing.  I think that their pricing is fair and they offer online specials on their website.  It's a friendly and clean environment and my normally anxious dog doesn't mind walking right in.  I highly recommend them.

Mi Patio is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants. The food is so fresh and delicious with generous portions and bargain-priced. Fast, friendly service and $1.75 margaritas all day!

We love this ballpark. It's conveniently located in downtown Phoenix close to the freeways. The retractable roof is a great feature of this park. No matter the weather, it's always comfortable inside!

We love Eden's Grill!  It's family owned and everything is prepared by the owner who uses family recipes she brought from Iraq. The portions are generous and perfectly prepared. The kebabs are delicious and the rice is to die for!

I love this Target because it's big, clean and bright with everything I need including groceries. I also always find great things that I didn't know I needed, so it can be dangerous to shop here unless you're disciplined.  The only problem I have is that Target needs to scan your ID when you buy wine. I like their inexpensive 3 glass boxes of wine, but c'mon Target I'm over 50!

Fresh and authentic Chinese food. We especially love their seafood dishes. They also make the best hot and sour soup I've ever had. It's perfect for whatever ails you!

I had a root canal done by Dr. McClammy six months ago and I was very impressed by him and his staff. Unfortunately, I've needed root canals in the past that weren't the most pleasant experiences, so I felt dread when a molar with an old crown started to show symptoms. My general dentist referred me to Dr. McClammy who did an excellent job on my tooth and best of all the root canal was completely PAINLESS! I returned today for a routine follow up,  and Christin was very warm and professional. The office is beautiful and serene. The exam chair faced a wall of windows looking out onto a picturesque landscape. The staff are kind and respectful and obviously accustomed to anxious patients. They use 3d digital X-rays and other advanced technology.  I hope I won't be needing another root canal in the future but if I do, I won't hesitate to return to Dr. McClammy.

Thanks to Yelp we found this great little breakfast place while visiting Las Vegas. It's away from the strip, located in the middle of an industrial plaza.  We went on a weekday and waited about 15 min to be seated. We were greeted warmly and offered coffee while we waited. The coffee was excellent. When I asked the waitress about it, she said that they grind the beans in house. The food was also very good and the service was outstanding.  The ambience wasn't my favorite -think strip mall diner-noisy and crowded. The friendly owner was walking around greeting everyone and told us that they're planning to move to a nearby larger location early next year.  We like to support local businesses and will look for Mr. Mamas new location the next time we're in Las Vegas.

This is a perfect area for all ages and abilities to get out and enjoy the desert. There is a flat paved nature trail as well as many other trails leaving from the welcome center. Volunteers were on hand to answer questions. The city of Scottsdale does a great job of maintaining this heavily used preserve. There are drinking fountains and rest rooms at the welcome area.  We enjoyed the 4 1/2 mile Gateway Loop which was a moderate uphill hike to the Gateway saddle then an easy downhill hike the rest of the way. There are lots of beautiful views all along the loop.  Bring water and wear good shoes. Flip flops or flimsy shoes aren't safe on these rocky desert trails.  Sunscreen and a hat are very helpful too.

Benedict's is a tiny neighborhood place open for breakfast and lunch. They have about 4 little tables inside and the same outside in front.  We were hungry after a morning hike and waited about 5 min for a table. We each ordered an omelet. The service was friendly, but the wait for our food was very long. The kitchen staff obviously couldn't keep up the Sunday we were there. Our server brought us a slice of delicious coffee cake while we waited which was a nice gesture.  The omelets were good, but we felt were overpriced at $9.  We took advantage of their yelp deal which made it a better value.  I'd like to try Benedict's again on a weekday when it's hopefully not as busy.

Our side by side refrigerator/freezer wasn't keeping the food cold so we called Vladimir. He came out the next day and diagnosed the problem as a malfunctioning control board. Fortunately he carries all kinds of appliance parts on his truck and was able to replace the board immediately. His prices are fair and he really seems to know what he's talking about.  I recommend eliminating the middle man and call this small business owner. We will call him again if we need appliance repair.

I love Mediterranean food so I took advantage of a Groupon deal for ZK Grill. It's a small storefront place with little ambiance. You order at the counter for takeout or they'll bring it to your table. We ate there as required by the Groupon deal.  They have a good selection including photos of each dish on the menu. The portions are generous and the pricing is very fair.  I had a Greek Salad w/Chicken, $8.99 and my companion had Beef+Lamb combo which included salad and basmati rice, $13.99. Everything was very fresh. The generous meat portions were seasoned and grilled perfectly.  We tried the baklava for dessert which was some of the best we've ever had, so flaky and sweet, sprinkled with pistachios. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! The baklava alone is worth 5 stars! We will definitely stop by and pick up take out here in the future.

Prices have gone up about a dollar each. My favorite, Greek salad with chicken is now $9.99. Still well worth it for great fresh food.

Beautiful well maintained ballpark. This is a great way to enjoy Spring Training baseball in the Arizona sunshine. There are different ticket options including lawn seats for only $9. each. They have many different types of food and drinks from the Pima tribe's fry bread to Maine lobster. My favorite is the large fruity Sangria!

We went on a Monday night and took advantage of their 1/2 off bottles of wine night. Our party ordered a pepperoni pizza (all of the pizzas are 12"), an order of lasagna and a strawberry & Gorgonzola salad, all of which were very good.  They have a nice patio, but it was too hot to sit outside this time. They had live music which was great, and unexpected on a Monday night. It was a little loud, however. More of a bar atmosphere than I expected at 6 pm.   They have different specials throughout the week and daily happy hour with food and drink specials.

I've been to Vy's a few times and am always satisfied. I've tried other nail salons and keep coming back to Vy's. You can call for an appointment or just walk in. They are a clean salon, have all the colors, do a great job and are open 7 days a week. It's nice to know that they are always available when I need a good pedicure with a relaxing leg massage.

My husband and I are regular theater goers back home and loved this show while on vacation in Vegas. We bought tickets on the same day through one of the discount Tix4Tonight kiosks on the strip. We sat in the 7th row-great seats! But honestly, it's a small theater designed with just an orchestra section and a mezzanine (no balcony), so every seat has a great view.  You can sit in the less expensive sections and still see and hear this great show. You'll have a great time and leave singing those great old songs!

We like to support locally owned small businesses, and this place is great! They have the BEST coffee, roasted here in Tempe. The most delicious French toast we've ever had! Fresh squeezed o.j. (with lots of pulp), organic milk and produce plus cage free eggs are all part of what sets this place apart from other breakfast places.  I'm sure we'll be back often!

Brenda has has helped us so much with our adult rescue dog who came to us without training and with some bad habits. Since Brenda came to our house and worked with us, our dog's behavior has greatly improved. She follows commands, heels on walks, sits/stays, etc. We appreciate that Brenda uses positive training methods. She really understands and loves dogs and has several of her own. I highly recommend her!

The restaurant was empty at 6:30 on a weeknight. I was greeted by an expressionless employee and was seated. The chicken teriyaki was the worst I've ever had. Very dry slices of chicken with a drizzle of thin teriyaki sauce and a large rice portion. It also came with "salad" on the same plate which consisted of lettuce and a few grated carrots with some sort of sweet tasting orange salad dressing (French)? There was loud pop music blaring from speakers which didn't mesh with the restaurants' ambiance.  To be fair, they had a lot of sushi choices which I didn't try. But, unfortunately I won't be returning.

We tried Rotana because of the Groupon deal. We found a sign on the door saying that they no longer honor Groupon or Yelp. Because we had committed to meet another couple there, we decided to stay and eat. The service was very good as was the food. But because of the duplicitous nature of them luring us there, we won't return and I can only give them one star.
