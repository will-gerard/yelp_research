Always a great place for a bagel and cream cheese in the morning.  Beats the heck out of Einsteins!

Went there for happy hour yesterday (Friday).  Food was excellent, service was spectacular, and the oysters were quite good.  The desserts looked amazing but when it came time for a slice of cheesecake we were just way too full...  Great prices for happy hour!

It's Starbucks.   At this particular location though, if the drive through is busy, just go inside... It'll be quicker, I promise.

Bad enough the first time I probably won't try it again...  Waited 20 minutes for a standard gyro and fries, fries were good but those aren't Greek so I don't count them.  Gyro meat was cold and tasteless and the pita was crusty.
