Everyone was very nice here, but oh boy. Hot and sour soup is my favorite soup and I have a forgiving tongue for the varieties that chinese restaurants offer, but this was the worst. Downright horrendous. Just tasted like a TON of vinegar without any quality or flavor. I forced five spoonfuls and then could not continue... the fried rice was also the worst I have had. You really can't afford to have bad rice as a Chinese restaurant, but without a doubt, this was the worst. I want to say some nice things, but all I can really say is avoid at all costs. :(

Great pizza! Not those damn tiny teeny 1 person pizzas for $20 like most places in downtown Phoenix! HUGE big slice delicious greasy heaven. And yes, the price is right. The establishment itself screams classic. Mostly bare, couple rag tag tables, minimal decor, lots of focus on just eating good pizza. Haven't tried the wings yet, but I am looking forward to it. Thanks Franks!

Avoid! Visited for the first time recently, pretty cool place almost! Waitress explained it was happy hour and appetizers were half off and drinks were also discounted. So we ordered apps and drinks. When the bill came there was no discount applied so we mentioned it to another server. We were then told they messed up, and that they had given us incorrect information. Understandable of course, except then we were told there was nothing they could do and we would have to pay full price. (!) No apology, not shit. We will never come back! (Which is a bummer because we wanted to like this place). Respect your self and go elsewhere.

This place has an awesome beer selection, great friendly service, and an interesting 2nd floor location. I got a hotdog I'll never forget and some sliders that were to slide for! The valet parking seems inappropriate and shouldn't exist, but you can always park across the street for free.

This place is fantastic. The staff has character, personality, and are super helpful. The atmosphere is relaxed and enlivening, adding flavor to a mostly greyscale, vaporous, and boring downtown. Now let's get serious! THE SUSHI: the sushi is made with a purple rice, tastes delightfully fresh, and yes, it is delicious. I will be back, many times.

This place is super fun! Might seem chintzy at first glance, but this place is not to be underestimated. The sushi travels on conveyor belts that move around the restaurant and you can try a huge assortment of different sushi. The sushi is pretty good and a select few of the servers are kind, helpful, and AWESOME!  Recommended!

I tried this new establishment out recently and can say I enjoy: -the decor and restaurant layout -the relaxed and friendly service -how close this location is to my job and home (personal benefit)  Unfortunately I did not feel that the ramen was very high quality... the broth was so extremely oily I ended up with a stomach ache for most of the rest of the day. This is very unusual for me as I can typically consume darn near anything and feel great. The ramen was served pick-up style on a cafeteria tray in a little plastic black bowl, which was quite unimpressive as far as presentation/portion is concerned. The pork was mostly fat and the noodles were of a low quality. I had very high hopes for this place, but yikes. As this spot is fairly new I truly hope they can pull it together and produce something enjoyable. I'll be back in a month to give it another shot, fingers crossed for the best.
