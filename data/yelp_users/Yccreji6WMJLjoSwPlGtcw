Ok 3 strikes you're out.  I love the idea of the place but the service is so abominably terrible, I leave there frustrated and angry.  Usually I'm traveling between my homes in Tempe and Sedona and stop here for breakfast or lunch.  Three times now in a row the service has been so horrible they've offered me a free piece of pie to make up for it. Yesterday I waited 45 min for a sandwich.  I saw two tables sit down after me and leave before I was served one bite of food.  I waited 15 min to be even noticed and they weren't that busy. I was told with an attitude "we have 4 dining rooms, everyone is waiting " after  my second complaint about no food.  And my sandwich was on dry stale bread. The only consolation was a piece of pie that I was too pissed off to even wait for.  That may have taken another half an hour and we were so late getting in the road now. I left so angry, didnt get the whole pie I'd intended on purchasing but got a $6.99 delicious pie from Safeway instead. I'm done with this place.  What could be a charming pit stop is a descent in to stress hell.

I got my first tattoo ever there on Valentine's Day.  I went to Mary who was just amazing.  She took three images I sent her and combined them in to the perfect image--one I hadn't even imagined myself. It incorporated my late sister's exact signature. I love it.  I went with my friend who also got a perfect tat from Mary right after me.  The place is clean and spacious and a very cool environment.  It took less time than I'd imagined and was beyond reasonable. Actually I thought she didn't charge enough for all the work she put in to it.  Thank you Fifth Estate!  If I decide to get another, I know exactly where to go!

Michelle is amazing.  She does it all in her one room day spa.  I had a full face threading and eyebrow tint and the most amazing facial I've ever had.  She has a great touch and sensibility in choosing the facial I needed.  The environment is clean and warm.  I was on there 90 min. but felt like I was transported away for hours. She also does massage. I highly recommend her.

I love love love this place.  The coffee is out of this world as is all of the menu!  I want to go sit with my laptop and hang out there soon- great ambiance.  How lucky are we in Tempe that they moved in?

This is an amazing service for Vets to come in to your home to offer euthanasia services without even knowing your animal prior.  I was so fortunate to find them as my dear cat Buddy's cancer spread so fast that I had just one day to figure out a terribly difficult situation.  I just hated the thought of putting him in the car to take him to be euthanized, with his last memories of life being in terror. I was so grateful to find this service to come in to the comfort of my home and offer this service.  The Vet and assistant were kind and professional and unrushed.  They made sure I had plenty of time to say my final painful goodbyes.  They were kind and compassionate to me start to finish. Dr. Veena contacted me almost immediately after writing an inquiry.  She arranged the appointment for the following day around my schedule after a thorough and very kind telephone consult. In addition to sedating my precious cat and allowing him to relax with me quietly before the final medication was given, they provided a clay paw print of him as part of the package. I paid in advance and they took credit cards easily.  I don't mind going to pick up the ashes when they are ready.  I expected that. I found the fee entirely reasonable and far less than what I would have expected for this concierge type service. I feel much more at peace having used this service although I did lose my precious cat of 15 years.  If that had to happen, which was inevitable, this service made it so much easier for me. I will recommend Angel Vet to anyone I know needing euthanasia for their dear pet. Thank you.
