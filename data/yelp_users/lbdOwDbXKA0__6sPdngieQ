Excellent! Affordable and very friendly. I brought in a two piece suit, I needed to have the coat brought in, and the pants tapered as well. I brought them in a Tuesday evening, I needed the suit for the next night for my wife and I's anniversary dinner. I knew it would be along shot, but I asked if it could be done. They did! I'am so grateful for that, and will never forget...

Always fast, always friendly! I have recently become a regular to this EB location.  I'm usually in store weekdays 7:45-8:15 am window and the wait to order and receive my meal is always minimal (2-3 min).   My recommendation is my usual,  power protein bagel toasted with PB and strawberry jelly.

Excellent tasting dogs here. I believe the secret to their dog is in the bun. It has that traditional sweet Mexican taste, possibly handmade or brought from south the border. You can't have just one!  Seats are limited, but they do accept major credit cards.

The service here is bad, they don't care to give you a refill, or even smile. Bathrooms aren't clean... Blah blah.. Despite this, Still gets 5 stars because the PHO is that dang good, and the spring rolls are a must. Come, get... It.

I've been coming to this gym for 6months and have no complaints. Has everything (almost) you need .. Staff always greets you warmly upon entrance and exit.  Plan to be here for a while.  Satisfied client, healthier, stronger and feeling great.

Great tasting chicken and the southern bread is wonderful. Canes sauce is a must must must.  Don't see any dessert on the menu,  only downer .. But open until midnight ! Great for late night cravings .. Great value for the amount of food per meal.

Pizza -fell way below expectations in flavor, especially priced at $12.00+ for 10" you'd also expect much more.   Burger- save yourself the $10+, this also fell short of even decent. Thick, bland, aged tasting beef patty, with a single tomato slice thicker than the patty itself..    Buffalo wings- you'll remember how un memorable these are. So pass. .   Service - we arrived at 10:10PM (they close at 11) and already out server seemed so uninterested, even after telling him this was our first visit.  This basically did it for me,  and won't be returning, especially with many better pizza/burger/ bar places near.   One star only because it is a nice comfortable place to have a drink and pass a nice time.   One last thing, the men's restroom is awkwardly small and is supposed to be for double. . Save yourself that awkward moment, and lock the door, pee alone.
