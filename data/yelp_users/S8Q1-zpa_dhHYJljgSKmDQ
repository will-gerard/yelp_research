Dr.Joyce Basset is a true perfectionist and professional. She is an award winning cosmetic dental artist. I am not kidding she is an artist when it comes to making your smile the best it can be for your face. Her office is stunning and her staff is as good as she is. Need an emergency repair: she will get you in right away.

I bought myself replacement diamond stud earrings there. Loved the service ,price and knowledge I received. I shopped at several places but loved the friendly vib here so much I would always go back . Intimate, friendly and in no way intimidating. Lisa, her husband and assistant manager were awesome. This place is a gem.

Wow I just spent a week in Chicago where the food is out of this world. I stopped at Flemings after a holiday party. Happy hour was still going on. The food and service was A Plus. It has been years since I have been there. The bar only had 1 seat and was super dark. I was with my 88 year old mother. everyone eating in the very dark bar were so nice and even wiling to move so we could have 2 seats. All worked out well. Staff was so professional and nice, even though the place was packed. Great Tv watching for football. Beyond great service and to ,my total surprise the happy hour food was terrific.

I have been going to North for 10 years. It once was a cool,layed back place with great service and food. The bartenders knew their regulars and there were a lot. Sorry Sam Fox. No longer true. It is so hot in there and the service is awful.. I asked if I could sample 2 wines. I was given a dime size of wine each time. I settled on Conte Fini Pino Grigio. A safe no brainer. Bartender opened the bottle then sat it down at the bar gave us 2 empty glasses, then left. She didn't even pour 1 glass. And the wine was warm. The pizza of the day was cheese and sausage. I asked if I could get it with out sausage but with a little basil on top. No I was told. It would cost a dollar. Ok I said. The pizza was like cardboard with crust. It used to be great. What happened? It was crowded so I guess they don't care.

I used to love this place. Now dark, depressing and the food is so over priced and has really gone down hill.

The food was a total surprise. Excellent. Finally I can say I had a great meal in Scottsdale that didn't taste like it was pre made. The fish tacos actually contained fish. The food was so delicious and fresh. The flat bread pizza tasted like pizza not cardboard. Hope they stay in business and keep the same quality of food. Check it out. Only thing that slightly bothered me was the loud music in the bar. That could be toned down at happy hour. Or maybe different music.
