The best deli in central phx! Stan and his daughter run the place and are making sandwiches everyday! They use boars head meat and cheese so you know it's going to be great! Try the Tyler or the doughboy, can't go wrong!

This is my favorite dive bar in Phoenix! Doesn't hurt that I live within walking distance, but I digress. Terry, one of the bartenders, is the main reason I like going there, she's very friendly and makes a good cocktail, plus will turn up the music if I ask her, which when you're deep in that jukebox game is always appreciated! They have three pool tables and two real dart boards and you usually don't have to wait to get either. Good, cheap, stiff drinks, games, good tunes, friendly staff, and nice atmosphere...everything you need/want in a good bar!

Very friendly and expert staff! Were able to get my fiancée's ring sized down in under and hour for about $50. Would highly recommend it to anyone!

I love pats! My friends and I have been going there since high school for the amazing lunch special, back in 2001 it was $2.50 for two slices(that are huge) and a drink, and today I think it costs like $4, def a hot deal. This is also the fiancé and I's go-to pizza delivery spot. Best ny style pizza in Phoenix in my opinion. Always friendly and the delivery is typically quicker than the time they quote you. When doing delivery ordering the pizza well done helps the crust to hold its integrity since sometimes it can be a tiny bit soggy by the time it gets to you. Wings extra crispy bc crispy wings are the best! Keep up the good work Pat's!

Amazing Chinese food, definitely my favorite for take out in central phx. Reasonably priced and the owner is the sweetest little lady in the world, and she makes bomb food! They use high grade poultry and meat so you never ever get that nasty fatty tendon piece of orange chicken that would normally ruin it for me and is very common in my experience at a lot of other Chinese restaurants I've been to. The lettuce wraps, soups(all of them, seriously), Kung pao chicken are all solid! If you're looking for Chinese in central phx, check out the prime!

Hand down our favorite, go-to spot for brunch(daily) or dinner. The lady and I love sitting at the bar and watching the food being made. The staff is friendly and attentive. Can't go wrong with any of the food. Some favorites being the chipotle ribs, enchiladas with eggs and the green chili stew.

We went last year & again this year but were thoroughly disappointed with the festival this go around. Last year there was an actual salsa tasting competition, which was awesome, plus you were able to buy jars of salsa as well. This year the only salsa we saw was from Jo Bot & it was just a little plastic cup with no chips, sweet I love shooting salsa. Otherwise the beers were ok, if you like deschutes beer, the margarita was good. But the main thing is that it cost more this year just to get in & there was not a sample in sight you didn't have to pay for, there were fewer vendors & overall I just didn't feel it was worth the time or the money. The salsa tasting was the best thing they had going & without that it's just another excuse to charge people money to stand in an empty dirt lot with not much to do. Get your shit together chili fest or else I'm afraid this fall festival is DOA.

Amazing, authentic, some of the best tacos I've ever had in phoenix, and I've lived here my whole life. Sample each meat if it's your first time, they're all good so you really can't go wrong...but be warned, get the habenero sauce on the side, it's crazy hot!

Love this quaint, cozy little spot tucked behind shine coffee. The gf and I go here regularly and absolutely love the food, drinks, staff, and ambiance. The charcuterie plate is a must, not many spots where you can pick two cheese and two meat options for $12, fantastic value! We also really love the ribs, they are crave-worthy and despite there being so many amazing options we continue to go straight for those ribs every time. They have a great beer selection that changes from time to time, but there's always something interesting to try. We tend to always have the same server, and I feel so bad bc I can't remember his name, but he is the best! Always remembers us and is a main reason we continue to frequent this great little spot!

Have already been twice since their soft opening last weekend! Love this new neighborhood place from the team behind crudo. Have had the Tennessee hot fried chicken, the stack salad, chicken wings and a focaccia flatbread....all of it delicious! The drinks are great and the atmosphere is perfect for a low key dinner at the bar! Okra will definitely be in my restaurant rotation from now on!
