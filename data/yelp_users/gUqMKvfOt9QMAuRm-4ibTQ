I did not enjoy my experience at this restaurant. To be fair the calamari appetizer was excellent, however both of our entrees were extremely lacking, especially considering the price. The server seemed overwhelmed despite there was only about 5 occupied tables. The busboy was not only extremely unprofessional (constantly making inappropriate jokes) but he was slimy in the way he approached my girlfriend. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and my only greater regret from eating there was not informing the manager of the poor service and food we received. I was extremely let down and confused as so many reviews of this restaurant were great, but it seemed like amateur hour to me.

This bar is one of my favorite joints. Alex and Brit are stellar and always have a great smile! I'm not a regular but I'm getting there. Food is good, well it's no Ruth Chris but definitely gets the job done!

This place is dope. Pastrami sliders are on point, and extremely cheap for how awesome they are. Nuff said.

A great experience! The theater has comfortable leather seats with plenty of elbow room. The lobby is modern and inviting featuring a bar and lounge seating. It isn't necessarily cheap however with a Groupon its definitely a great value. The food as tasty especially considering its a theater and not a restaurant. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys watching a good movie in comfort with a beer and a burger on hand!

This place is a total dive, I watched some LITERALLY get his hand cut off at the bar.
