Ordered takeout the other night cobb salad (feta instead of blue cheese) and the vanilla bean cheesecake. Salad was fresh, shredded lettuce, crispy bacon, delicious vinaigrette, and huge!  Cheese cake was amazing! Vanilla bean muse added a creamy not too sweet touch of phenomenal!   Had not eaten at Cheesecake in years because I am not big on chain restaurants, but was impressed and excited to return!

When I entered this place I was confused if they were open or not. I had to walk around to find a server. I only stayed because I was meeting friends for brunch. The server was nice but messed up everyone's order.  I won't even get started on the disappointment in the food.

Great Gluten Free Pizza! I was a little upset to discover they do not make the gluten free crust. Nicole's New Favorite was fabulous! My husband had the spaghetti calzone with ricotta cheese and meatballs, which he said was great and like the crust too. Staff was warm and friendly. Restaurant was clean.

Best chips and salsa in Scottsdale.  Fabulous nachos! Great margaritas- get 'The Boss" Smoky pork hatch quesadilla is amazing Black and blue salad is wonderful  I personally do not like their chicken but I like shredded white meat cooked in a pressure cooker. They grill chicken great or do shredded chicken but not all white meat. Wishing they would add the delicious smoky pork as an option and not just for the Smoky hatch quesadilla.  Staff is warm and friendly.   A great place to take family and friends visiting Arizona.

Menu and management have changed so many times, it's hard to keep up. Food has been awful, good, and back to disgusting currently. Not sure why the new manager changed the menu and mage it worse! They get great bands but a lousy set up for live music, so caustics is always off and it's impossible to hear anyone talk unless you scream. Staff is okay. It has not been the same since Amy left. They crown can be seedy.

Fresh food, can choose level of hotness ( Thai hot 1-5), delicious curries. Great for lunch, a quick bite, or takeout.  Green curry with chicken is AMAZING!

Great crust and pizza. A little pricey $20 for a 14 inch pepperoni but its the only quality pizza place that delivers.

The owners of AZ88 and Hanny's are amazing! I only wish they would open up a third place in AZ, preferably in north Scottsdale. I love the atmosphere at Hanny's. The food is incredible. The fact that they have gluten free crust is even better. I do wish they served there amazing Az88 waffle fries or some other amazing French fry. The menu is a bit selective but wonderful. And of course they serve fabulous drinks:) Hanny's is great spot to enjoy a great time with friends with superb service, cocktails and food in a fashion focused environment

Thank you Nothing Bundt Cakes for donating mini bundt cakes to The Junior League!  I had my first Bundt cake (white chocolate) last night and it was absolutely, perfectly, amazing!!!!  I thought I would take a bite to try the cake out, expecting it to be good... It was so good, I finished the whole cake! The white chocolate bundt cake was moist, had a perfect amount of frosting drizzled on top and down the middle and raspberries in the cake. Cake flavor was delicious! I will definitely be in to pick up some more soon to share with friends.

Best chicken and hummus Love the Arnold palmers  They know how to cook their chicken Favorites include: chicken and hummus, medchiladia, wood-fired salmon salad, glazed-chicken pizza, pesto pizza, spicy chicken pita (ask for it in a bowl instead), Greek salad, lentil soup, turkey pesto lavosh wrap ( substitute chicken instead of turkey), and grilled vegetable salad.  Tempe location has a great breakfast too.

Thanks to Yelp I discovered this Amazing  Taco gem on the way to a meeting down town.  La Condesa has a great salsa bar. The margaritas are tasty too! Love the selection of tacos on the menu.  The tacos were so delicious that when I started eating, I texted my husband to go there on his way home from work. Luckily he made it there before I had to take off to my meeting, and agrees, the food is amazing.  The carnitas is my favorite.  I cannot wait  to go again.

Excellent burgers. Amazing sweet potato tots. Love the Pittsburg burger. Great beers on draft. Milkshakes are tasty. Everyone I bring to CB&CB love the burgers and tots.  Buns are so-so and have changed a few times but I go bun-less Great buffalo chicken dip and chips Hot dogs are good  Great happy hour and buy one app get one free for game days! Don't get the prim beef sandwich Turkey burger is okay Chicken sandwich is good but not their signature dish Service can be slow but staff is personable   Only complaint is its not healthy enough to eat regularly

Read great reviews. I need to go back and not get any seafood maybe? Shrimp and grits were nothing in comparison to NOLA shrimp and grits.  Shrimp were tiny and over seasoned. Salads looked good. Will have to try a salad or short ribs next time.  Service and ambiance was wonderful!

Gave this place a second chance. . . It will be my last! Pasta was under cooked. Roasted chicken was soaked in a rancid broth.  Risotto was undercooked and bland.  Mia must stand for Francesca's severs are M.I.A. Ambiance is dull.  Rigatoni was meaty but sauceless.  Over priced food for Macaroni Grill/Olive Garden quality food.  Huge disappointment for a neighborhood restaurant.

I was so excited for The Grind to open down the street from my house. I heard excellent reviews of their Camelback.  A huge let down. Not the best burger. The Grind has a high bar to raise with Local Bistro, Tavern Americano, and Cold Beers and Cheese Burgers in the neighborhood, who all have AMAZING food, service, and burgers.  The burger was nothing to rave about and the fries were decent.  I was not impressed by the menu of options either. I was especially dissatisfied with the staff.  The staff: The manager bad mouthed Tavern Americano when they first opened. I found this to be unprofessional and arrogant. The bartender bad mouthed SOL Mexican Cocina after telling her that's where we ate earlier that evening. Not sure what the manager and bartender were going for by bad mouthing other neighborhood restaurants to my friends and I but they definitely lost a few customers that were trying  to give The Grind a second chance.  Atmosphere: Not sure what  vibe the owner wants, but besides a new name, staff, and menu... it still looks like the old place, Jasper's Peak.    I was told they wanted to appeal to a younger crowd, stay open late, and be the neighborhoods lounge. A neighborhood lounge would be AMAZING! I picture something similar to Merc Bar. A burger lounge, open late, an awesome DJ, great drinks, and great hip crowd.  I see lots of potential for improvement all around and hope the pull it together. I love supporting neighborhood restaurants.

Best milkshakes. Oreo and salted caramel are my favorite, but I've tried them all, and all are delicious!  Ambience is great. Casual and hip.   Burgers are great. They're are many options for everyone, including vegetarian and non read meat options that sound fantastic.   Servers are friendly and readily available when needed.
