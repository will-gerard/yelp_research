Totally pleased with the service I received for replacing a battery in my watch. Complicated procedure with the type of watch I  have and they did it onsite!!!  No waiting for 2-3 weeks.  Friendly owners.  Looked like they had some lovely jewelry too!!  Highly recommended!

We stopped in to play some Buzztime trivia and have dinner.  The trivia sight lines were good although I had to turn in two boxes before I got one that was reliable.    My plus one ordered the stromboli which he said was very good - it sure looked good.  He ordered french fries as the side - cholesteral alert - and I had to try them so I could write about them.  They were quite good.    I ordered my favorite which is the Chicken Wrap.   It has pieces of chicken, lettuce, onion, tomato and italian dressing wrapped up in a tortilla.  I always ask for the dressing on the side.  With that I ordered the fresh veggies - what will power!  So I got a variety of cukes, carrotts and broccoli with a ranch dipper.  Very fresh and tasty.    Met some friendly folks who were regulars and also played trivia.  Because I came in #3 in the country I received a free 22 ounce brewski of my choice.  My plus one and I were both prettty full so we transferred the beer to our trivia playing buddies.    All in all a really good place to stop for food, trivia and/or sports watching.  The bartenders seemed to know a lot of clientele - must have lots of regulars - which isn't suprising.

My husband has been wanting to try this place as he's a big BBQ fan.  While I like BBQ it isn't the be all and end all for me.  Anyway, I was very pleasantly surprised by this place.  It's fairly large inside with a couple separate dining areas.  Forest greeny booths and the decor is all pink and green.  A big pig mural in a top hat painted on one wall, gave the place an apostrophe on it's piggy decor.    Hubby had the recommended pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and really liked it.  The BBQ beans he ordered as his side were a little on the sweet side, but he finished them up to the last bean.  I ordered a mesquite grilled chicken breast and it was really smoky flavored and tasty.  I really liked their homemade BBQ sauce - it was finger licken delightful.  I had the cole slaw as a side and while it was OK it was a bit mayonaisy for my taste.  Our waitress was great.  She was attentive and informative when we asked her about Guy Fieri's visit and what he ate.  One thing he ate was the BBQ shrimp.  Dang!!!  I missed that on the menu....next time for sure, I'm in on the shrimp.

We arrived at JD's at 5PM last Saturday evening.  The hostess asked us if we had reservations which we didn't.  She said they were pretty full in the dining room but we were welcome to sit at some inviting high top tables by the window in the bar or in a large comfortable looking booth in the bar.  We chose the booth and got down to business.  Our waitress was great - just the right amount of attention and always there when we needed her.  She was knowledgeable about the food and drink and we were all happy with our choices in both areas.   We chose the bacon wrapped scallops as an appetizer.  They were delicious.  The scallops were done to a T (I don't like gelatinous scallops - or jiggly as I call them).  For entrees my partner and I chose a cedar planked walleye fillet with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus and halibut served Veracruz style in a sauce of garlic, onions, olives, capers, and chipotle peppers with saut√©ed spinach.  Both fish entrees were wonderful.  We looked at the dessert menu but were able to pass as we were pretty full.  Great place, loved the dark wood, clubby atmosphere!  I would definitely go back again and hope for the same waitress.

This is a find!  Colorful decor and food that is a cut above your average Mexican fare.  I actually had the grilled shrimp soup which was wonderful.  A flavorful broth with large pieces of vegetables (carrots, onions, celery, squash) and a generous portion of shrimp and fresh warm tortillas on the side made for a memorable meal.    My companion enjoyed the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans and enjoyed every morsel.  Our waitress was delightful and her service was top notch.  We chatted with her on the way out about the Menudo Soup that they make from scratch there.   Menudo, a fabled hangover remedy, is made with tripe (beef stomach) in a broth with red chilles and only the cook knows what else.    The decor is colorful - my glass of chardonnay was very adequate and a generous pour.  I'll definitely be back - maybe not for the Menudo though.

I am a fan of costco.  I like their Kirkland brand.  I love the optical dept.  Just got a pair of long distance glasses with all the coatings - my eyes glaze over when they start talking about the coatings - and paid $128.  That is remarkable!!  I've paid $400 to $500 in the past.    We especially like the Cambazola cheese, the Kirkland Pulled Pork, the fresh halibut (when they have it in), Kirkland nuts etc etc.  The store is always clean and there are of course 'the samples'.  You could eat a lunch as you wend your way through the aisles.    Personnel are friendly and good at keeping the sometimes long lines at the checkout moving.

How can healthy taste so good.  We stopped here for lunch last week and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Granted the acoustics are not good - it's hard to hear yourself read the menu, but, the food more than made up for it, plus our waitress was fantastic -knowledgeable, friendly, happy - I'd love to have her again.    It may be unusual to start with the ice tea, but that was some of the best ice tea I've ever had.  It was a big glass and I was happy to get a refill.  I ordered the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap which was yummy.  Grilled chicken, tomato, and onion in a light garlic sauce wrapped in Lavosh Bread and then wood fired made for a great sandwich.  The chicken was moist and seasoned to a t and the veggies were grilled to just the right degree - not mushy and not too firm.  This was a huge portion in itself but came with a greek salad which was also good good.    I do have to mention that I went back here a few days ago and while I still thought the food was amazing, this is not the place to go if you have a group that you want to converse with.  The acoustics are bad and it was really hard to do all that lip reading.  Will I go back?  You bettcha!

I am a fan!  My dearest and I went last night - he is borderline diabetic so doesn't eat pizza very often.  But, he had a need for za so we went to Grimaldi's.  We had been there once before many year ago with a larger party but this was just the two of us.  Red and white checkered tablecloths - I looked around for LADY or a TRAMP but none in sight.  We got there early and were lucky to score a high top table as the place was filled otherwise.  Our waitress was so good.  Personable, knowledgeable about the menu and much more importantly, friendly.    I ordered the house pinot  for $4.00.  WOW.  Generous pour and a really nice pinot.  OK so my dearest went with a Miller Lite.............  There are three basic choices for the pizza.   Regular, tomato based sauce (sure it was San Marzano's), white sauce and pesto.  We opted for the regular with meatball, onion, mushroom and green pepper on half for you know who!  Not me!  The atmosphere is fun - lively, kids doing their thing, and a great patio!  We waited awhile for our pizza but it was fun just date talking and people watching.   Several of the people around us ordered one of their salads.  They looked wonderful and the small one easily feeds 3 if not 4.    When our pizza came it was delicioso!  I am such a fan.  They only serve beer and wine but what's not to like with an excellent pino grig at $4 and Miller Lite ( oh yes they did have many other more palatable options).    I am looking forward to going back!  Highly recommended!

I have been here many times over the last four years of sunbirding here in the desert. I have tried many different things and with one exception have always been pleased.  The service is prompt, friendly and knowledgable.  The house chard is a generous pour.  Their cookie thingie - Pizookie I think - is dangerously nummy!    Some of my favorites here are the tomato basil soup, the shrimp tacos which I enjoyed last night, the vegetarian pizza in the Light offerings, the turkey burger and the fries.  Any of these are great!     I'd go back any time.  Always get great value for the money.

This was the last night of my six day birthday celebration!  I could not have been more happy to spend an evening here with such good friends!  We couldn't have asked for a better venue and the food was soooo good!  Two of my four dining companians had the sausage and peppers and both of them raved about it.  They both like some heat so I assume there was heat for the taking.  The other two of us  of ordered Chicken Marsala and Chicken Piccata.  I know we both scraped our plates clean!!  Plus the bread is so good!  The wait staff was really good too.  And they took about 8 pictures of us to get one that we all looked good in.    The music started at about 8:15  That's when the great people watching starts, which I love.     What can I say?  The food us really 4 stars.- the waitstaff it incredible and  if you dance or not - it's fun to stay for the dance-floor show!!

I'm surprised there aren't any other reviews on this little gem because I know it's been around for at least a year.  We stopped in with some friends for dinner tonight.  They have a full bar, but I had a glass of chardonnay rather than my perfect rob roy.  The chardonnay was a flavorful pour at a really good price.  Our waitress and her helpers were very attentive (with the exception of water not being delivered as soon as requested).    I ordered the tilapia and it was some of the best tilapia I've eaten.  Pan fried so it was just a little crispy around the edges and with wonderful flavor.  I also had a baked potato which was very good.  There are good baked potatoes and then 'meh' baked potatoes and this one was good.  It came with pats of real butter and a generous portion of sour cream.  The vegetable of the day was a sauteed squash which was flavorful and just the right degree of firmness.  Tonight I chose the soup of the day - Italian Wedding - rather than my usual salad.  It too was very tasty!    The lights were a little bright to my liking but that's just me.  They have what looks to be a little one person band on Saturday nights - may have to try that at some point.  Even though my wonderful companion is not keen on dancing - unless an elevator dance at a wedding - it's fun watching the couples here in Sun City show off their dancin moves.     We will definitely go back and although I may be tempted to try something new on the menu I think I'll have to go with the tilapia, but next time - make mine a perfect rob roy, perfectly please...

I have loved this place for many years.  At my son's suggestion we would stop at their old location on the way to the airport when we would visit Phoenix. Great atmosphere, private adobe booths and best of all great food.  Everything we tried was good good good.    Fast forward 10 years or so and we are Sunbirds here in AZ for the winter.  The old Richardsons burned down several years ago - major bummer - but the phoenix has arisen in a newly built Richardson's.  It is every bit as good.  It has the same wonderful cozy, intimate feel with the very private booths and a luxurious bar that is always filled with happy, satisfied customers.  On a recent visit I had the Chilean Sea Bass which was buttery, flaky and done to a tee.  It was served with an assortment of sauteed vegetables incluing green beans, baby carrotts, squash and mushrooms.  Also their special green chile potato was a welcome sight.  Two Rob Roys with some wonderful, totally different kind of maraschino's,rounded out the delightful experience, not to mention my charming dining companion.     Oh I will be back Richardson's of New Mexico!  Thanks again!

Still a five - without a doubt!!  We went here with another couple who are good friends.  They had never been to Richardson's before and so we were a little uneasy about whether they would like it as much as we do.  We arrived at 5:20 without reservations because for some reason I thought they didn't take reservations for under eight which they indeed do.  They take reservations for 4 and over.  Anyway, they seated us immediately but explained that our table had been reserved for 6:45 and would that work for us.  Yes, indeedy!!  Nabbed a great corner cozy booth!  One of the best in the house!!  As soon as we sat down we were served big glasses of ice water with lemon and asked if we wanted chips and salsa.  We had never ordered them before and they were really good.  They came warm, with a very flavorful guacamole, a salsa which tasted really great but was a little too warm for me and a couple other dips which I didn't try because I thought they'd be warmer than the salsa.   We ordered drinks - one Reisling, two house Margaritas and one Rob Roy on the Rocks.  Everyone was pleased with their libations!  Onto our dinner orders!   Two of us ordered the grilled shrimp pasta which was amazing!  I can't begin to guess how many calories were in that dish but it was so worth every bite and we both brought some home.  Our companions ordered two of their chicken items and were very pleased!    Our waiter was wonderful!  He was knowledgeable about the menu and spent time with us describing the various dishes.    They also have specials every night written on a chalkboard.  Lots of great sounding stuff, but oh my, that shrimp pasta was - ooh la la!  Will I be back?  Without a doubt if my chapter three in life lasts awhile longer!

I'm not familiar with Hawaiian food and so I may be short-sighted in my review, but I didn't really care for Leo's.  My husband liked his pretty well and would probably have gone with a high three, but since this is my review I need to give it a 2.  The place was very clean and cheery in a strip mall restaurant sort of way.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken.  It came with cabbage and my original thought was, great, something pretty healthy.  But, the cabbage was underneath the chicken which was soaked in the teriyaki sauce and was somewhat greasy.  This made the cabbage quite soggy and unappealing to my taste.  It also came with a generous scoop of their macaroni salad.  I would have to agree with one of the other reviewers who said it had too much mayonnaise and not enough flavor.    I would pass on going back - but my plus one would probably be easily persuaded.

My hubby and I were just there for a happy hour dinner.  Unbelievable!!  I had the best sea bass I've ever eaten, served with ginger rice and sauteed veggies (mostly yellow and green summer squash and onions).  The fish rested on a sauce that was delish, something with corn and slightly sweet.  I also enjoyed two glasses of the house chard which was nice.  My hubby had a huge plate of corn beef and cabbage with little red potatoes and carrotts.  And he enjoyed two glasses of Harp.  The bill was $37 total (without tip).    The trick is to go during Happy Hour (M through F from 3PM to 6PM).  All the food on the menu is 1/2 price and the food is wonderful.  There are also great prices on drinks during that time.  Our waiter was friendly and checked back frequently to make sure we were OK.  Nice Nice Nice.  I am looking forward to our next trip back.  Only trouble is now I don't think I'll order anything other than the sea bass!!

My rating probably isn't fair.  I'm rating this in comparison to the casinos in MN and WI.  I enjoy playing video poker and there were very few of those machines.  And the ones they did have were in constant use.  Very few of the other kinds of machines were familiar to me but I did try several.  Also, if we had gone on a day other than Sunday it would probably have been more enjoyable.  It was very crowded and so there were not many open machines of any sort.    But, for the day we were there it was a two.  I would go back and try to get one of the video pokers - people seemed to be doing pretty well on those and reluctant to give up their seats, unless to a family member or friend - in tandem.    Cigarette smoke is always a problem for non - smokers in any casino, but, their ventilation system was pretty efficient in keeping it tolerable.

We stopped in here for an early dinner after a movie across the street.  This place has a great location and a nice atmosphere inside. They have some great bubble machines that are fun and relaxing to watch.  We were greeted by a very friendly guy at the door who gave us the history of the place.  Apparently the original restaurant is somewhere in California - I believe by San Fran.  We were seated at a nice booth below three bubble machines.  I'm ready to roll now!  Our waiter was great, friendly, and johnny-on the spot (even though his name wasn't Johnny).  I ordered the house chard which was very nice and a good pour.  My husband a tall whiskey water and our friend a gin and tonic.  Zoom in on the gin and NOT tonic.  It tasted pretty much like gin and water with a nice lime.  Our waiter said he would get her and new one and returned very quickly with a new gin and NOT tonic.  He asked her if she'd like to order something else instead and she opted for a Bloody Mary.  Pretty soon one of the managers returned with a third gin and tonic and said that the bartender was pushing the wrong button.  Our friend was just not ready to go for a third and got the bloody instead.  She said the bloody was strong and good.    OK - let's move onto the food.  Drum roll......ba dum tsh....  Our friend and I each got 1/2 order of Joey's special which we were told was one of the most popular dishes at the original restaurant.  It was listed on the menu as spinach, eggs and ground chuck saut√© with mushrooms.  We were expecting a scrambled egg saut√© mixture but when we got Joey's special it was totally green.  Almost all spinach with little bits of egg and ground chuck.  There were big button mushrooms on the top.  The dish was really salty and just way way too green and spinachy.  Our waiter did say that it was not the way the dish was supposed to look.  He graciously took them back and asked if we wanted anything else.  We declined and he took the items off the bill.  My husband got the chop salad with blue cheese dressing on the side.  The dressing didn't really taste blue cheesy but it was OK.  My friend and I were also able to pick a side.  I chose the sweet potato fries which were fine and my friend ordered the ratatouille which she did not care for.  I do not have any details on why but she also left that.  I am surprised that after the first manager brought the third gin and tonic and we turned back some food (very rarely will I ever do that but it was not at all edible) a manager never appeared back to apologize, ask what they could do differently, whatever.  We did not ask to have the meals taken off the tab but our waiter did do that.      When I look at other reviews mostly 4 and 5 starts I see some pretty positive ones for their Italian entrees. If I go again I would try one of them.  I did notice that many of the reviewers only have a few friends and very few reviews.  I am a bit surprised that some of them were not filtered.    I'd like to see this place make some changes in the food arena.
