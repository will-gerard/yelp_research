For dinner take-out I ordered the Chicken Lasagna. It was amazing!!! So much flavor & right out the oven. The parking lot was packed so the dining experience must be good; I'll have to dine in next time.

Lux is my fave place for great coffee! The staff are very friendly. Lux is a half coffee shop and half cocktail bar. The cocktails are amazing as well. If you don't know what to get ask the bartender what they recommend. The best item on the menu is the grilled cheese. Hand down! It was recommended with avocado and boy was it good! Try it, you wont be disappointed.

I can't get enough of this place! Its a cute half grocery store half restaurant. The grocery store lets you grab and go for pre packaged meals (salads, sushi, drinks etc). The store itself is super cute! You can find so many knick-knacks plus a great wine selection. There is also a menu board to order sandwiches and personal pizzas.   Do you like dessert?! So many great treats! The "Old Timer" is a rich chocolate cake. Try it! Also Gelato! Go during Happy hour to get Gelato half off. Yum!  My favorite salad is the Kale & Quinoa salad and I add Chicken Salad mix on top ($3 up charge). Taste so good. Try it!   Parking can be a hassle but there are several areas (walking distance) to park or valet in the back.  I'll be a customer for life. Thanks LGO!

First off this is a Oaxaca style type of "Mexican" food. Get similar with the style.   My friend and I do taco Tuesday every week and we have seen great reviews about La Santisima. So glad we decided to give this place a shot.   We started with agua de Horchata. It was so sweet (good sweet) & different from a typical Horchata; which had strawberries and almonds mixed in. Our appetizer was Queso Fundido with chorizo. The queso is a Oaxaxa cheese, which is very thick and comes on a very hot plate with flour tortillas. We really enjoyed the cheese. Yum!  The gourmet tacos section had a variety of tacos at 3.99 each (which is on the pricey side for me) and street tacos for 2.55 each. Because we like to live on the edge we decided to go gourmet this evening. The best deal is just to get the plate for 8.95 which includes 2 tacos (same tacos) with rice and beans. I ordered the Wild Tiger Shrimp, which was breaded topped with cabbage and some type of lime sour cream on corn tortillas. It was really good once we topped out tacos with salsa. The salsa bar must of had about 12 different salsas. Guacamole was pretty spicy, more spicy than most of the salsas on the bar. The beans were amazing! Who would say that about beans, but yes I did.   Over all we loved this spot. Not sure if they have happy hour or a taco Tuesday special. The waitress did not mention any specials. I'll sure to be back.

Best restaurant in Phoenix! My favorite! The staff are always very friendly and helpful when recommending food & drinks. I personally like sitting at the bar, watching the bartenders make cocktails. The best deal for beer & cocktails, everything $5 before 5pm including their pitchers. Food is also so delicious; from appetizers to entrees, brunch to dinner. The mac'n'cheese side is my fave! Yum!

Horrible venue! My friends and I showed up to the Ty Dolla Sign Concert to find the doors completely closed. We thought we were at the wrong address going around in circles. Turned out it was canceled. At least put a sign on the door or post a cancellation on Facebook post. Very disappointed.

The Vig is my favorite downtown spot. The area is different that the other Vigs'  around the valley. Its in a neighborhood community, the home was turned into a restaurant. Parking however is difficult. The outside space with the yard is nice and huge with corn hole games.   You're greeted as soon as you arrive. I would recommend making a reservation for larger parties & ask to have the checks split before hand. It took an hour to get out bill figured out on my birthday night. I have also gone with a small groups.   The best item on the menu is "The Best Turkey Sandwich"! Its Thanksgiving in your mouth! The Mac'N'Chz with the add-ins and fish tacos were amazing as well. My son loves the kids menu! So good for kids. The cocktails are delicious & refreshing. I personally like sitting at the bar to see the drinks being made.  Best Sunday Funday spot with bottomless mimosas and a live DJ outside. It gets busy so get there early for a table.   A+ spot! Good food! Good staff! Great area! I'll be coming back often.

Bitter & twisted is by far my favorite cocktail parlor in Phoenix. Notice I said parlor; don't mistake this for some club or dive bar.   The sign to the bar is very small & on a odd corner entrance. When you arrive you may have to wait for a table, the wait times vary on which day you go.  When you walk in there are drapes at the entrance, gives it a mysterious vibe. That is where is host will seat you. I personally like sitting at the bar to watch the bartenders make cocktails.   The cocktail menu can be overwhelming but just tell the bartender what you like and/or don't like. They will make exactly what your taste buds like. I have never been disappointed on their creations.   I'll continue to go to Bitter & Twisted

If you're in the area you have to stop by for Taco Tuesday. $1.50 tacos! There are different specials everyday.   This Taco place is not some hole in the wall nasty floor taco shop. You walk in and its a clean hip taco shop with great decor on the walls. Has a modern rustic feel. The bar seats about 10 people, but the chairs are too high and too close. I would suggest getting a table if available.   As first timers we got the Queso fundido. The cheese isn't a traditional queso fundido but it was still tasty. I do wish the chips were made in house. The chips are store bought.   The tacos were really good. The size of your palm taco size. Good portion of meat as well. The tacos come with one salsa of choice. Habanero was spicy but missing some flavor.  The service was great! Sweet server and always checked on us.  I do plan on coming back to try the gourmet burritos and salads.

This is definitely a high end restaurant/bar. Dakota has great d√©cor all around. The vibe makes me want to put a fancy cocktail dress on. The patio has a lot of seating and great corner to see the other clubs. The bar is where I like to sit, and the chairs are pretty but a little too bulky.   There food is on a B+ scale. Very ordinary brunch and lunch menu. No bar food; its more like sandwiches and salads.   Brunch is the time of day I like to go to and there have been several specials that I've like; specials change time to time. On Sundays they have $1 mimosas for ladies. We didn't find this out till after the bill. It would great if the staff would communicate and tell the daily specials.   The night scene gets crowded and the prices are over priced for a tiny drink. I'll stick to brunch Sundays. Its really a hit or miss depending what kind of food and atmosphere you're looking for.

I have always wanted to try this place so on a dead Sunday night my friend and I decided to check it out. As soon as we walked in, we walked over to sit in the booth dining section; the waitress told us the section was CLOSED & only the patio or bar was open. So we sat outside.   The waitress took 10 mins to get us menus and drinks. Then another 15 mins to get our order. We ordered a family salad and pizza. The salad came out in 12 mins and the pizza in 55 mins. At the 40 min mark, the waitress mentioned she can see the pizza coming out in 5 mins. Literally almost and hour to get our pizza, hence there were no other customers but us. Our pizza came out cold. The waitress didn't check on us for at least 20 mins, at that point there was no reason to get a remake of the pizza. Even though the pizza was cold, it did have a lot of flavor. Hence why I gave 2 stars.  When we were cashing out, I asked her why the inside dining section was closed off? She responded "I'm too lazy to walk from the kitchen to the farthest dining section. Talk about rude and lazy.  So 2 stars for delicious COLD pizza. Bad & lazy service. Not sure if I will be back or just get take out.
