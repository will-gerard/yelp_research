I went to this restaurant for my B-day last week for starters I ordered the humus it is was very good...maybe the best that I have tasted....I ordered the beef kabob it was really good but I liked the chicken a lot better. They give you large helpings of food. This place is really good...I agree with another review this is good for special occasions. I am new to Persian food and was a little confused with the pita...basil...onion and butter platter and our server did not do a very good job explaining. Loved the bread I will go back to this restaurant.

I love this place...happy hour is amazing I would go on Tuesday for Martinis having just two you will be leaving nice. The garlic hummus was tasty...but not for those who do not love garlic it is beyond garlicky. I usually go for happy hour I love the fries I have had almost every flavor. yum! This is a good place for brunch on the weekend they have great mimosas although the techno can get a little old if you are not into techno.

I absolutely love this place...the tea-tini's are great I have not been here for a while but the pear poached salad was awesome. I have been meaning to go back to this place it has a great atmosphere. Great for brunch on Saturday or Sunday and they have so many teas. This is a great place to try...the food is great definitely a gem in Chandler.

I had a very different experience here, but I did not order from the buffet I ordered to go I had takiki Marsala, Channa Marsala and some lovely veg samosas. This was the first time I went to this place the food was good...some of the best that I have tasted. I will definitely go to this place again the staff was friendly and I guess I am going to have to try the buffet.

I loved the atmosphere of this restaurant, I was a little disappointed in the service. I was also disappointed because other people on here were able to eat the beef patties and they did not have them when I went there. This was one of the main reasons why I went there....I really wanted one. But I also ordered the curry goat because of other reviews  which was really good and also tasted the Jerk chicken it tasted more like a BBQ sauce I expected a little heat. I loved the rice and fried plantains. I overheard another customer say that the food did not taste the same like like the pervious times that she had went there.  Overall, I enjoyed the food that I ordered, I would try this place again and see if things changed and will probably call ahead of time to see if they have beef patties available. Also I would have loved to have some music playing...I love reggae and all I heard while waiting was a sports channel on a TV by the bar.

Along with everyone else that is writing a review...I absolutely love this place. Not only is this one of the best zumba classes that I have ever been to this is a safe environment where you can just let loose.   Just come and experience it for yourself you will be hooked as I was!  P.S.  She also has classes for kids it is a goos way to get them out of the house and not infront of the TV.
