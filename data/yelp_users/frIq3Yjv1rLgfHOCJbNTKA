Been taking my dog lewis here for past two years. Customer service has always been great. Even when its crazy busy and phones are ringing off the hook, staff has handled things smoothly.  Jen grooms lewis and she does a fantastic job! And let me tell ya...hes a hand full :)

Been coming here for yrs. I love this place. Brought a dress in today, on a saturday and asked to have my dress taken in a bit..also asked her if it could be ready same day. Even though I know she was super busy she happily did it and did a phenomenal job...thank you Thomas tailoring! !!!

Came here for lunch the other day...as we sat down to view the menu, a ant was on my menu...killed it and didn't think much of it...as I was talking to my friend I see a ant crawling across his chest..then we started to look around and found another one in the booth so we immediately told staff and moved to another booth...the manager looked around the booth and thought it was "weird" he didn't see anything...after we moved to the other booth our waitress set plates in front of us and my plate had a dead fruit fly on it and I immediately called it out and showed the manager as well...no one had any comments...and to top it off I ordered a Mai tai and it was served with a dead fruit fly as well...we didn't eat our food that was served or I didn't drink my drink..payed for the bill and took off. Nothing was comped.

Been going here for years to people watch and have drinks...past three times I have ate there and wasnt impressed. The seabass is extreamly fishy and last night I ordered the Mahi Mahi...it was dark and tasted like chicken.  I had to fill up on pretzel bread because waiter didnt come back for 30mins after serving the food :(

Absolutely amazing. Better than i imagined.  I had the summer tomato pizza which has heirloom Bridgette topping, pesto, Arugula, goat cheese and Saba. Sooo good. Also had the Mediterranean salad. That had cucumber, cherry tomatoes, quinoa, feta, almonds, and a lemon organic vinaigrette. Both amazing. Also had a hangover rx drink...added vodka of course :) service was incredible. Staff knew menu inside out. Highly recommended

Food wasnt so great but the service was phenomenal so I will return to try again. The Chilean seabass was extremely fishy. A lot of iceberg salads on menu :( wasnt impressed with the lobster mash potatoes either. The cook came out to apologize and made us something else. Staff was great. The environment is beautiful and I even got a tour of the place and kitchen. It was a great experience. I will return and hope for an improvement of the food.
