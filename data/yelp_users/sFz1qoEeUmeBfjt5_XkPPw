I'm so glad my boyfriend introduced me to this restaurant. The first time I came here I fell in love with their food. I love their rice dishes, appetizers, desserts, and most importantly their pho! Gahhhh their pho is the best I've ever had. It's all about their broth. It isn't watered down like most viet restaurants have them. It's made to perfection. So delicious I don't even need to add anything to it. I used to always eat here once a week with my bf. Before work or on my days off. It helps that he also know the people that own this place cause they always know how to take care of us. Keep up the good work guys : ) oh and don't forget to try their ice cream macarons!! You won't be disappointed!

This place is very disappointing. Worst Chinese food I ever had. I asked of they have some type of fried wings or chicken they gave me fried chicken breasts that were cut up in pieces that had no flavor. Ordered chop suey and it tasted rotten. Also had beef Mongolian and it didn't taste right as well. Too bad I took this to go and ate it at home. I didn't want to drive back to the restaurant and complain to get my money back. My stomach was hurting the next few hours because of their food. I had to call of work due to food poisoned. I had a feeling their food was either old or they mixed their old food with the new one. Not good. I will never go back here.

Pizza here was okay.. I ordered their wings and calamari for appetizers. Wings was decent and calamari was good. It's soft when you chew it unlike other calamari they're rubbery. I had their Puerto Penasco Carne Street Pie Pizza. I was really hungry after I finished the appetizers. I waited for at least half an hour till the pizza got to our table. I'll be honest I'm very impatient especially when it comes to food taking that long. No excuse. I had 2 small slices and after that I wasn't that hungry anymore cause the wait was too long. Pizza was okay and everything else. It didn't wow me especially the service. I'm not too sure if I will come back here.

As a fast food restaurant you can't really expect much. I've been to many different taco bells and they all seemed decent. Good service and good food. This one in the Laveen area has to be the worst. Why? Bad, rude employees who have the worst attitude ever. A young Hispanic chick who was is her 20's had the guts to roll her eyes at me when I asked for extra sauce. Geez how hard is it to get more sauce. It's not like I'm asking for gold here.

Worst costco in Az ever. I usually go to the one in gilbert thats located in 202 and santan. Poor customer service. When I went to the cashier to pay all of my stuff. No greeting nor smile. I didnt expect them to but its always nice. Maybe because in gilbert area people are always nice there so im used to that. Im frustrated that I didnt get the girl who was putting my stuff on my cart she had a nasty attitude! I asked if I can get a box to put my stuff on. She said did you wanna box your detergent and the heavy stuff?! She asked me that like I was a stupid person.. i said umm no I just want the little ones boxed because usually people in gilbert they ask if i want a box. Here at this location they dont. She well you need to wait and let me finish this first. Geez I didnt know it was wrong for me to ask for a box. . I will never return to this location and if i did and I see her. I will surely ask for her next time and report to her manager how nasty she is with her guests.. i dont care if you are having a bad day do not take it out on your customers or leave your job at that if you a nasty worker!!!

I took my brother and mother here for his birthday and her mother's day dinner tonight. The service was great and all but the appetizers and entrees took a long time to get to our table. Also, when I ordered my steak I asked for medium well. They gave me a steak that was more than well done.. It was burnt, very dry, and hard to cut into! I complained to my waiter Daniel saying it was burnt and he apologized. He told his manager and his manager gave me the steak I wanted which was medium well. I was still a little disappointed because I waited half an hour for it to be cooked. My family was already done eating so I just told them that I'd take it to go. I was expecting a little comp for their mistake. Usually a good restaurant will do that when they make a mistake obviously this one didn't care.. I don't think I'll ever be back here and I didn't even enjoy my dinner with my family. If you dont wanna wait long for your food please dont go to this restaurant well at least this location.

I love their taro here! They perfected it. I always get that every time I'm nearby. I also like their honey dew, pop corn chicken, squid balls, and fish balls. It comes with a sauce on the side. So yummy and mouth watering. Ahhh :p. You can't compare this boba place to others here in AZ. They're not as good and this place has a variety of different flavors you could choose from. So stop by sometime and try it : )

I usually dont shop at bashas but it was the closest one near my house, I figured why not go here for groceries. Today my little brother wanted orange juice, some fruits, and pastries. We went up the cashier name Roxie. She was chatting with her co workers and didn't even acknowledge us. I asked if she was open and she replied saying huh?? She asked if I had a  bashas card and I said no may I have one. She gives me the application and I was skimming through it she said just sign it. I said ok may I bring it back the next time I come again. She said yes that's what I said! Wow she was beyond rude!! Don't even go to work if you have that type of attitude and all you do is chit chat while there are customers waiting!!! Forget this supermarket. Horrible customer service. Will never return back here! Thanks to your cashier Roxie!

Do not go here for a car wash or oil change!!!!!! I went here to get both last week and I noticed I got my perfume stolen and change. I complained to the manager and he did nothing.. He never gave me my money back for the stolen perfume and they have bad customer service!!!!!! Please be careful when leaving your car to their employees. Yes they do steal!!!!! And their manager was an asshole he never even apologized. They are lucky I didn't call the police on them. They're a waste of time. Worst business I've ever went to and this was my first time visiting them.

Honestly the worst mexican fast food restaurant I've ever been to. First of all I ordered Carne asada fries and one shrimp taco. The lady asked me what taco? I said shrimp and she said okay.. I figured she understood that. Secondly, I waited 18 mins for my food to be done. That is way too long for a fast food restaurant I mean they should have it called slow food paced as a snail restaurant. Lastly, I got my food but I didn't bother enough to check till I got home because I got off work pretty late and I was super hungry. I checked my food when I got home and they gave me the wrong taco ughhhh. They gave beef taco which had very less meat in it. I took a bite the taco tasted old and it wasn't even crunchy, it was like eating chips that were stale and old. I threw that away. Next I tried my Carne asada fries. Gosh it was disgusting, it's like they put the whole bottle of salt in these fries and the meat. That's all I could taste. Never again will I go back and order food/ eat here. I'd rather have taco bell and it's a lot more cheaper too. Just an advice please listen to your customers order on what they want. It sucks getting the wrong food when you think it's what you wanted to eat. Horrible experience

I went here for dinner with my bf on a Wednesday night around 9 ish. Our hostess who had long black hair dark skinned asian in her 20's gave us a booth towards the middle. I asked if I can sit towards the back instead. She got mad and rolled her eyes. Very rude.. When I sat down, I looked at her and she looked mad. Like hello? That's your job if a customer isn't comfortable sitting at the table you wanted them to they can switch to a different one if they want. Ever heard of customer is always right??? We just wanted to be comfortable that's all. It was a busy night and our food wasn't all that great. We ordered sushi and spicy ramen miso soup. It seemed as if they rushed it because it was busy. I don't care how busy it is I want to enjoy my dinner and their service here is horrible. I should've told my bf to leave with me when I seen that rude young hostess giving us attitude!!! If you dont like your job I suggest you should quit and not give customers attitude because I will tell everyone I know not to visit this place due to your bad service and food!!! Never again will I come back here I'd rather spend my money somewhere else!

I tried many different places for pho in chandler. This place is by far the best. Why? The service I get from the people who work here never disappoints me. When it comes to pho I tend to look for the flavor in their broth. Their broth here isn't the best but it's tasty enough to beat all of the ones I've experienced everywhere in chandler. It's quite good. I also always order their rice dishes and spring rolls with the peanut sauce. Ahhh thinking about it just makes me hungry. Their Thai tea is good as well and I love how they always check up on me to see how's the food taste. I'll always be back here every time I am nearby. : )

I had their pho here. It was pretty much all water. When I order pho, I like to taste the broth. Their broth was too plain not much flavor. They gave me a little bit of noodles and not enough meat as if they were trying to save money on food. This place rated 4.5 stars which is why I came in the first place. I used their restroom and locked the door to wash my hands. While I was washing my hands, a lil boy opened the door. I guess their locks were broken. SMH! good thing I wasn't in the toilet. So be aware of that people when you're trying to do your business in there. That would have been embarrassing. Overall, the food was not all that great and service was ok. I didn't enjoy eating here at all. I'm sure I won't be back. There's other places that are much better than this for pho..

I went to this location plenty of times for birthday's, graduation, and special occasions.. No reservations needed. The keg by far is still the best steak house restaurant I have ever been too. Why? Service is always great which is very important to me and food is always delish!! I love that they always cook the steak like how I want them too. They once made a mistake on my bill by doubling the drink I ordered which was a strawberry daiquiri. I complained right away and the manager apologized and took it off. He even offered us free dessert which was awesome! Something that will make their guest happy and satisfied. This is exactly what makes me keep coming back is for the service!!!! And of course the great meal. I will definitely be back here!! I never leave unsatisfied with this place.

First time coming here this afternoon and it was great. My whole neck and back was hurting. I told the therapist to do a light massage because I have such a sensitive and small body. She did an awesome job and asked me if the pressure was ok. Some therapist wouldn't even bother to ask. I enjoyed every minute of the massage . I felt amazed after and the pain on my back was gone! The pricing was descent. It wasn't  too bad at all. I will definitely come back again for their business!

Ice cream here was unbelievably delicious! You can tell it is fresh daily and you can taste the difference that it's homemade. Their ice cream is soft not hard like other ice creams you've had. My favorite is the mango and strawberry. If I'm nearby this area I definitely have to stop by and get dessert. I love that the girl who works here is also friendly at all times!

I've been here three times and I never had any bad experiences or massage. I had carol take care of me today and she was the best. I told her my neck and upper back was bothering me. I didn't tell her what pressure level I wanted she already knew how I wanted it. I'm a small person and very petite so I'm pretty sensitive when it comes to massages. Everything went great and I don't have a stiff neck anymore. All of my pain went away! Thank you carol! Oh and what I love about this place is that they dont bother me with memberships unlike other massage places such as LaVida, Massage envy, etc... You cant go wrong with the prices here also. Finally found a massage place that I absolutely love :)

I felt like I was home having breakfast here. It's a small place because it is a cafe but the people here welcomed me and treated me like I was their family. I had their delicious strawberry crepes and my bf had an omelet with potatoes and biscuits. Not too shabby and their prices were pretty good. The service was fantastic. Now I know a good breakfast place around my area. Awesome job guys!

Omg!!! Horrible experience dining here. My boyfriend and I made reservation last night for our anniversary dinner date. It did not go well. The only positive about this was our appetizer which was crab and spinach artichoke dip. That I enjoyed at least. After that, I ordered a 10 ounce steak medium well and my bf ordered salad. I waited at least 20 mins for my steak and I was super hungry. The steak was really salty like they put the whole bottle of salt. I complained and told them I didn't like it. I ordered sushi instead and didn't enjoy that either. I waited long for the waitress to come back to my table and refill my water. She took so long. I felt like she forgot about our table and assisted other guests. I won't be back here, I didn't enjoy my anniversary dinner nor service. This restaurant did poor on everything.

I would still drive all the way here from chandler than lee lees. Only because they have more stuff than leelees. I like the fact that they have a food court, restaurants, hair cut place, and boba. You have a lot to choose from. I dont have to wander around and try to look if they have a certain item because they always do. Also they dont sell old stuff unlike leelees..

Poor customer service. Always run out of fold overs i suggest to take it off their stand or the menu since they never have it at this location. They always take forever to get my order ready even when it is never busy.

I've tried different hair salons near where I live in Chandler Gilbert area. They're all pretty pricey and I'm never satisfied with the way they cut my hair for the price they charge me. Christine is my hairstylist I've known her for years. She always knows what I want and like with my hair. She listens as long as you tell her what exactly do you want. They charge me half of what I pay here other than these expensive salons such as Tony and Guy, White Lotus, etc. I always call ahead of time to make an appointment with Christine because I know she's always busy with other clients. She's gotten mad at me a few times for getting a haircut at other places but that won't happen again because I know I'll always be back for her because she knows what she's doing. Even though she works in Mesa I'll drive all the way there to get a haircut from her. At least I know that she won't mess up my hair. She's the best. She makes me look good all of the time : )

I love buffalo wild wings and all but the service at this location is not good!! I had a server she was a blonde too bad I didn't get her name. I went here after work with my bf around 10 pm. I ordered mild traditional wings, nachos, and spinach chicken artichoke flatbread. I asked the server for extra ranch and she forgot when she gave me my wings to my table. I told my bf to ask her again maybe she didn't hear me.. She didn't even acknowledge us and she was taking care of other customers. So it was time to pay then I asked her one last time may I have 2 extra ranch. She rolled her eyes and said ughhh ok now I have to go back and get it. Wow!!! She was so rude I wanted to curse her out but I didn't I told her just forget it and I left. Is it right for their employees to treat their customers like this???? I will never go back to this location. They have bad customer service and I was nice enough to even tip. People like her should not have a job especially dealing with customers because obviously they dont know how to treat people with respect. I suggest she should find another job because she's ruining this restaurants business with her negative attitude.

I only joined because I wanted to only work out and I needed a gym thats open 24/7. And its this place! Im glad this gym is only 5 mins from where I live. They dont bother me with signing up for personal trainers unlike other gyms. That could be very annoying. The equipments they have here are very well maintained and clean. Its like having your own gym! Yes its small but it has everything you needed. There's no pool or jacuzzi. It has a tanning booth..  Like I said if you need a gym thats open 24/7 and doesn't bother you with any contracts or personal trainer this is the gym for u! Although you can sign for a personal trainer if you'd like. Its up to you.

$2 for an ice cream cookie sandwich? I'll take it. Not too shabby. I like going to this place after a meal. If I'm craving a small dessert, I definitely go here all of the time when I'm at mill ave. Cookies are always nice, soft, chewy, and fresh. Ice creams they have are fantastic also. Although, I wish they had more flavors but it's okay. The ones they have are still delish. People are always friendly which btw I love the most : )

My boyfriend introduced me to this place 2 years ago and every time we're nearby, I tell him we have to stop at snoh and get dessert! My fave is the taro snoh with strawberries and mochi on the side also top it off with lots condensed milk. So goooood!! I'm never disappointed with this place and people here are always friendly..

Walked in here I get a greeting already and they sit us at a table right away! Our server asked if we have been to this restaurant before we said it was our first. We told her we yelped what's good to eat in mesa and this restaurant popped up. I love how they have 3 variety of asian cusines. THAI, VIET, AND CHINESE FOOD! We checked in on yelp and got free veggie egg rolls.. It was so good!! Then for the appetizer, we had bbq beef which had two sauces on the side. One was sweet and the other one was like a mustard wasabi flavored which I wouldn't recommend trying because it had a strong taste and it wasn't good at all. But the bbq was marinated perfectly and it was juicy. No need for sauce! For dinner, we ordered seafood pan fried noodle, thai chicken basil, and spicy mogolian beef. All three were amazing. Just wow! The server also kept checking up on us to make sure we're enjoying our dinner and asked if we need anything else. After our dinner, she asked how the food was making a lil convo with us. I love that she's very open and actually talks to their customers.. She also wrapped all of our left overs. Usually most restaurants just gives you the box and plastic so you have to wrap your food yourself. Great food and great service. 5 stars! Especially our  first visit here.  Definitely will be back : )

Please don't judge this place because of how it looks when you first walk in that door. I had lunch here with a friend. We had calamari for starters which is quite a bit salty. We ordered house fried rice, beef braised noodle soup, and stir fry shrimp. Everything we ordered was flavorful besides the calamari. Fried rice came out great, the soup was tasty which also had no msg. You can taste the flavors from the beef. It was amazing! The stir fry shrimp was cooked perfectly and veggies were cooked the way I want them. Not too cooked I like my veggies when you here crunch crunch noises as you chew and bite. : )

Had dinner here with my bf. We were craving tacos and he found this place through yelp cause we wanted to eat nearby. The weather was nice so we ate outside! I had Carne asada, shrimp, and crispy fish with Spanish rice on the side. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh! So much flavor and I was satisfied with every bite. Their house salsa and chips were good for starters.. My bf had braised beef, shrimp, and crispy fish tacos as well with grilled veggies which he enjoyed very much. All we could say is MMMM! Service was great and they were all friendly. Thanks for the great experience on our first time being here. Definitely will be back.

I usually enjoy eating here but I went here with my bf 2 days ago around 7 pm. I didn't enjoy my blue crab. To me it was still a lil bit raw and I like my food fully cooked. I complained to the manager about it and she asked me a few times if I've eaten blue crab before like ummm yeah you think I would eat that if I never ate blue crab before. I just thought it was kinda rude of her and her other workers to ask me several times if I ate that before. She gave us another crab and it was still raw. It was disgusting I felt grossed out and didn't eat the rest of what I ordered. I used to enjoy going here now I don't know if I will come back. It was just horrible and disappointing. Ruined our vday dinner.

I had to update my review because I decided to give this restaurant another chance. I decided to go back here for dinner because I was craving seafood. We ordered a pound of crawfish, mussels, and sausages added with 2 bowls of rice. Most importantly I ordered 2 blue crabs again which this time it was fully cooked. I had to tell them I wanted it well done so that we don't get them kind of raw again. I guess from now on that's what I have to tell them so they won't make the same mistake. Service was definitely better because we had a different server who was much nicer and kept checking up on us.. I must say this second time around everything came out great! Surprisingly. Everything was fully cooked and tasted really good. I will definitely be back as long as they cooked my food fully. No more raw meat!

First time having dinner here last night. We had hot pot and got the ying and yang which was picking two different broth. I thought that was cool having to pick two different broths in case you and whoever you decide to eat with dont like to have what you chose. We had the japanese miso soup and the Tom Yum for our broth. The miso was delicious! Although the Tom yum tasted exactly like my mom's tamarind soup which was a bit strange but I didn't mind cause it was still tasty.. We also got shrimp, shabu beef, mussels, baby bok choy, fish cakes, and udon noodles on the side. They were all fresh and so yummy. Not bad at all.

I expected a lot from this place because I hear a lot of great reviews from my family and friends that this is way better than angry crab. I highly disagree. Why? First off, I ordered 2 pounds of crawfish, 2 pounds of shrimp, and 2 pounds of snow crab. All 3 were seasoned hot and juicy with medium level sauce. They do things here a little differently I guess. They give you which ever one is cooked first then you get the rest later. Unlike, angry crab whatever you ordered you get all of your food on time and all at once. I hate waiting especially when I'm really hungry. I don't like getting my food one by one. I want them all together so I can enjoy eating all at once. The crawfish tasted like it was sitting there for a while. It didn't taste fresh, it tasted old. The snow crab was okay. Probably the only one I really liked. Shrimp wasn't all that great. Not that much flavor. Service was great that's why I rated 2 stars. Overall I didn't enjoy eating here very much because of the high expectations I wanted from their food. I'd rather stick to angry crab. It's all about their sauce. To me it's tastier  than this place.

I had to update my review here. It was my older brothers birthday yesterday and I told him we should eat at angry crab. He preferred this place instead and I couldnt say no because it was his birthday. We ordered shrimp, black mussels, king crab legs, and crawfish all in hot and juicy sauce mild. We also ordered fries and soft shell crab. I was actually surprised because for the first time the sauce tasted great and everything was fresh. Out of all the times I visited here it did not taste right at all. The only downside towards this whole meal was the crawfish. It was overcooked. It was hard to get the meat off the shell. I wasnt surprised because their crawfish was always like that either over cooked or old. It would have been a 5 but Im a crawfish lover and it sucks that they could never get that right. So for all of you crawfish lovers I recommend you not to order that here. Everything else is great. Im glad I gave them a second chance. Will be back if my brother decides to eat here again.

I love this place! Way better than their other location in mesa! Friendly people and great food! The atmosphere here is way better also because there's more room. This one has bbq and the other doesn't. Had the brisket with the sides of potato salad and coleslaw. Mmmm mmmm good. I just got done eating here and writing this makes me hungry again. I guess I have ten stomach.. Also ordered 3 pounds of crawfish with medium trifecta sauce. Had sausages inside mixed with the crawfish inside the bag and ordered rice as well. So delicious I will be back here even though it's always crowded. It is worth the wait!!

If you dont have patience to wait then you will not like food trucks. I love food trucks! It is a different type of experience and they have variety types of food and dessert. I had ribs, wings, ice cream that was made from real milk in cows, burgers, and etc. I enjoyed it very much love trying new things!

I came in 10 mins before they were closing and they still welcomed us.. Most of their food was gone of course due to closing and they asked us what food do we want them to cook. So we told them what we wanted and they cooked it for us quickly. Everything was fresh and delicious. Restaurant was nice and clean especially the restrooms! No nasty smell.. I noticed most of their servers were from Pacific Seafood it turns out the owner in this buffet is the old owner from Pacific and now his brother is running Pacific. No wonder everything looked similar to that buffet other than that this is newer and much cleaner. I'm glad they opened this buffet because my family loves buffets! And this is only 10 mins away from my house which is great!! Must try people!

I came here around 7 am ish with the bf. I was super hungry and yelped for good breakfast around chandler/Gilbert area. I found henhouse cafe! I read the reviews and it says it's the best breakfast place in this area. Well they were absolutely right! Bf had chicken and waffles and I had their omelet with wheat sour dough. It was delicious. Everything was so fresh and tasty! Loved it with some fresh orange juice. Friendly waitresses too will definitely come back!

Omg I think I found a favorite korean restaurant and its this place! I usually go to OhYa or Chodang. Im so glad this place opened. It's quite new and it is very huge. If your fam/friends love kbbq I would reccomend this place! I had their galbi and ox tail soup. Oh so delish! Both came with rice. You have a choice of regular rice of purple rice. I tried purple because I never had it and its a lot healthier. It's really good you won't be disappointed. There are no purple rice in any other korean restaurants here in AZ that I know of. So everyone try this new hot place!! I guarantee you will love it

Highly disappointed with this place now. I was here for my birthday with my family last week on a wednesday. I told everyone they would love it here since I did. I wanted them to try this new place because I thought the service and food were always great. However it didnt go so well for mt birthday dinner... I walk on in to this place with my fam asking for a huge table. The new server whom I've never seen before said oh you're the one who had the birthday cake right. I said what cake? Yes its my birthday but I didnt know there was cake involved here. My bf had this angry look I guess it was supposed to be surprise for me. Well new guy thanks for ruining it. Now to the service? It was slow and horrible. I had no patience as we order our food with this new guy server they had. It seemed like he had no experience whatsoever. You ask him a question about the menu he says i dont know. At least take the time to find an answer for your customers. Never say i dont know it makes the compamy you work for look bad. Thats telling me you dont care at all right? Anyways, The fish that we usually order here is cooked this time it wasnt cooked right. It was rushed and not tasty at all. Looked like they cooked it for 30 secs and dumped it on the plate. Geez... Our rice came last usually it doesnt take that long when we order there kalbi.. hmmm my fam did not like it here Im not sure if I would be back. Knowing Im a regular here. Very disappointed especially on my special day. Ruined my bday surprise no bueno... smh
