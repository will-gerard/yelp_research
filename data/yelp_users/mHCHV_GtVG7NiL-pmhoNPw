Came here the other night. Ordered two venti white mocha fraps with coconut milk, three shots, double blended with no whip. Well let me tell you, this was THE BEST one I've ever had. It was made to perfection. That girl, should be awarded a metal.  I've had some horrible ones because they just don't know how to make it correctly.  Thank you so much for making my night with just a coffee.

If I could give this place ZERO stars I would.... we purchased a 65in Sony flat screen. The day of delivery, we confirmed three times that it would be delivered between 2:30-4:30 when 4:40 came around and no one had shown up yet, we called the store. They said they were running an hour late that they had called us and left a message, which they did not!! Two hours later, we call best buy back and were on hold for over an HOUR when they transfered the call to an outside company that handles their deliveries. After being on hold for 50minutes with them, they tell us our TV now will not be delivered until 8:30 PM!!!!!!  I'D LIKE TO KNOW, WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON WITH THIS COMPANY?!?!?!?!  NEVER again will I EVER shop here again!!

Restaurant was clean, buffet kept up and well stocked. This was my first time at this location and I'd be back if I was in the area again. They offer all kinds of salads, soups, pizza, pasta and fresh baked muffins. Don't forget to enjoy their soft serve ice cream!!

My sister and I went last night to see Rhob Thomas perform. The theater itself was very nice. We were in row ten in the wheelchair section, since she's in a wheelchair. As soon as Rhob came on, everyone stood up and remand standing. My sister could not see anything the whole night. Why on earth do you not have wheelchair seating in the front?!?! I paid allot of money for these tickets and was only able to hear it. This is so disappointing since Rhob Thomas is my sisters favorite performer and she wasn't even able to see him.

Amazing customer service!! This was the fourth water and ice my family had been to. We had to keep switching because the water always tasted nasty our the place was dirty.  This was a full service place. They not only filled all my jugs they also wheeled them out and lifted four full size jugs and four twenty pound bags of ice into our van. Customer service was wonderful!! We will definitely be using them in the future. Great job ladies!!

The water tastes like it would be toilet water. Once we were seated, we NEVER saw our waitress Rachel again. Our glasses remained empty. While we waited for our food, a man brought his little dog in under his arm and no one said anything (gross)!! We waited almost 30 minutes for our food. When our food finally came, it was warm. My youngest daughter ordered a sausage patty with her meal and received a smashed hamburger.  All in all, we will NOT be back to this location!!!  UPDATED::: 7/25/15  After writing my initial review, I was contacted right away by Matt with customer relations. He was very concerned about our review and had the manager Linda at that location contact me right away. She told me to come in and receive a couple meals, drinks and pies on the house for our horrible experience before. She apologized several times and told me our business was very important and she wanted to make it right. After talking to her that day my sister, children and I went back to the location and we were very well taken care of. We had a different waitress this time who was simply amazing. The food was made perfectly hot and our glasses were never empty. After this experience and how well Village Inn took care of us after our initial experience,  I can say, we will definitely be back.  Thank you so much village Inn for going above and beyond and making it right. I really appreciate the fantastic customer service and prompt replies. So, I am changing your star from a one to a five.

This review is about the experience my children, sister and I had today while visiting Wet and Wild... We got there at 5:17pm...paid almost sixty dollars for us(except my sister, who is in a wheelchair) the kids went on exactly three slides. We were there not even an hour, when my three kids and I were in line for one of them, when my oldest daughter lost consciousness and fainted.. EMT's were called and she was brought down via wheelchair to their first aid department. They checked her out and took vitals.. (Everyone there was great!)... After knowing my daughter was okay and had to be wheeled out in a wheelchair, I went to customer relations to get a refund since we were only there for not even an hour.. They, several times told me they do NOT give refunds!!! I then asked to speak to someone higher up.. When he came, he told me the same thing and offered to give me comp tickets. I told him, my kids were here for the summer, that they wouldn't be able to use them this season. He said that was the ONLY thing he could do!! (I took the tickets thinking I could maybe sell them on eBay).  After all this, I went back to the first aid department wanting a copy of the two papers they had me sign releasing my daughter. They told me they can't do that because it had medical information on it?! (Yeah, MY daughters)?!?! The kid then gave me a business card of his boss and told me to call her about it...  THIS PLACE WAS SUCH A LET DOWN FOR MY FAMILY... IT WAS MY NINE YEAR OLD DAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY AND WE WERE THERE TO CELEBRATE... I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT A FAMILY PARK WOULD NOT GIVE US A REFUND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY WE WERE TREATED AND WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS WATER PARK TO ANYONE!!!!

I ordered tonight (Thursday) an 8piece traditional wings $8 and some change. Got home and ALL of them were tiny.  I'm talking baby bird tiny. .....Why is it, when you order them on wing Wednesdays, you pay less and they're HUGE?!?!? You'd think when you PAY FULL price you'd get what you paid for. I've had this happen before, but this is the first I've complained about it. . I called the store,  talked to the manager and she said she couldn't credit me back, but if I came back in tonight she'd remake them.. I'm already home and my three kids are in bed. ..  She said that was all she could do. .. Talk about horrible customer service!! For now on,  Domino's gets my service!

Absolutely amazing dishes!!!  I don't know what's more impressive,  the food or the service.. We've been here on Christmas Day,  birthdays,  family get together and just because... So much exquisite food to choose from.. Make a point to come here for a really nice dinner.

We were a party of two... It took forever for a waitress to come over to us and there was only one other table in her section. Every time we asked for something, she'd dissapear for awile.. I ordered a soup and she only gave me two pkgs of crackers. I asked for more and she told me that's what comes with it. I asked for more, she brought me only two more.... The chicken fried steak I ordered was gross, with a weird taste. All in all, I would never come back to this location.

These guys are FANTASTIC!!!! My mom recommended them after they moved her out of her condo. So, I made sure I got the same three guys for my move. David, Daniel and Reuben. They arrived ontime as scheduled. Went through my house with me as I told them what all was going. They shrinked wrapped and used pads on all my tvs, dressers and even my teenagers standup dirty laundry basket.. They disassembled all four beds and wrapped them as well.  Arriving to my new house 40 minutes away, they unloaded and put everything where I asked them to. (Very patient with me since I kept changing my mind). They hooked up tvs, washer/dryer and assembled all the beds.   I would recommend Garcia Movers over and over again!! I plan on social media'ING the crap out of the amazing experience I had. Everyone needs to know that they can rely on this moving company and what a terrific job they all did!!  Thank you guys for making the transition for me so much easier!

Came here with my youngest while waiting for a prescription to be filled next door at Walgreens. Worst one I've ever been to. The ladies restroom was filthy! No soap and paper all over the floor. I don't think anyone as cleaned it all day. Very busy location when we went at 2:30 pm on a Wednesday. They only had ONE person at the register and there was a line of eight customers. Tons of employees in the back as well as a male Manager just standing around watching them. The ketchup dispenser was out, the napkin dispenser was out and the tables were not wiped down. I'd like to know, where is the management training here?!?! Why was the manager not on a register to help the flow of customers that came in to get them moving?? Very disappointed in this location and it's in my neighborhood  :(

Great place to take the kids or a nice night out with friends. .. Service is great and so friendly. . We were on the second floor. Our section had its own couch and table... Will definitely be back.. They also play great music, but extremely loud inside. It's hard to have a conversation in the bar area.

This review is for the food we received.... My oldest daughter(16) and I went to see in the theater today Minions. We ordered two chicken paninis and had them delivered to us before our movie started. Both paninis were incredibly hard, I'm talking break a tooth hard.  My daughters had little to no chicken on hers. We also weren't given forks to eat the pasta that comes as a side dish. The food was cold like it had been sitting awhile before being delivered to us. I'm very disappointed with today's visit.
