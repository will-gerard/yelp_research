The best so far that I've had in the Phoenix valley. I have not been to other locations. The portions are huge and the price, not huge!

This trip to the Melting Pot was an adventure into the unknown. Went with my bf, and a friend, for a bday celebration. None of us had ever been to the MP, or any fondue place for that matter. We weren't sure what to expect. It was a Friday night, didn't look too busy, but we still had to wait 30 minutes longer than our reservation for a table.  We chose a four-course meal, and it's amazing how small bites could be so rich and filling. I only took away one star for having to wait for half an hour for our reservation. Otherwise, good food and fun experience to go with friends.

I haven't been here through their "rush" hours, so service has always been fast and friendly.    Capastrami - Hot pastrami, Cole slaw, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing WITH sweet peppers. I can't get past ordering anything else when I come here.  Quality through and through.  One of these days I'll try their famous "Bobbie" (tryptophan coma here I come)... or maybe I'll just have to go Gal vs. Food and order the Capastrami AND the Bobbie (tryptophan coma and the -itis)

Locally owned and operated. Over the last year the salon has been renovated. It wasn't gross or dingy before the renovation, just new and different now. The pedicure chairs are like nothing I've ever seen at a nail salon, these cool fancy throne like chairs. Staff always friendly. This was the first nail salon I went to when I moved to Arizona, and tried a bunch of other places that are closer to where I live, but disappointed in most other places.  So, I stick with Nail Spa Expose because I know I will leave satisfied. And other salon services are excellent here as well, brow waxing/shaping, eyelash extensions. They do take walk ins, but they can get pretty busy, so I recommend making an appointment. They're pretty good at time management of the appointments, and you won't be left sitting around for 15 minutes or more for your appointment like I've experienced at other places.

I am not used to medical assistants conducting some of the eye tests, but the the medical technician explained the  purpose of each test, and did them quickly. Dr. Wood was really pleasant, and made eye exam easy and comfortable. Randi helped me in high over my vision insurance coverage to determine the most cost effective way to cover both contact lenses and glasses/lenses.

This place is ALWAYS busy and packed!!  Be prepared for a long wait for a table.  But once you get in and get seated, they've TVs galore. All of their food is massive, and everything I've had here is really good.  My first trip to Four Peaks was to quell a burger craving. Craving quenched - great variety of burgers. Subsequent trips have all been good - nachos, chicken fingers, wraps.  My most recent trip this past weekend, I had their margherita pizza - their version has white sauce and garlic, thin crust, one size, about 10" - and, as usual, Four Peaks came through, it was damn good.   Of course, it's a brewery, and they have great beer. If you're a beer fan, you'll love their beers from amber to stout.

This is an update to my review from my first visit. I've become a semi regular here, so that's gotta mean something...and every time I come, the place is packed. Pad Thai is one of the measures of a good Thai restaurant.  If the Pad Thai isn't made well, it makes me question the rest of the menu.  The noodles and ingredients are fresh.  If you get the prawns, they are delicious and huge!   I've had several different curries.  I think their Masaman is my favorite.  The service has always been pleasant and quick. They have a lunch special, price is great. 4 stars only because it's really a small place, and tables are pretty jammed up close together and the parking can be pretty much the same.

The coupons are misleading. The staff are not properly informed or can't keep up with the advertised promotions and either don't honor the promotion or give you the wrong promo items.

I live in San Diego, so only get to Zipps every so often when I'm in AZ visiting my bf.  The food is pretty standard bar/pub good. I've had their burgers, I've had their pizza, chicken fingers, chicken rolls - all of it decent, but not exciting or exceptionally good. BUUUT, Zipps earns their rating because they have THE best wings in the whole wide world!! ZIPPS GOLDEN WINGS are to die for!!  The perfect balance of crispy and juicy - and the "Golden" sauce, is liquid crack!!  I can't compare this Chandler location to any other Zipps locations because I've never been to any of their other locations.  I've been here a couple times during football season, Sunday night or Monday night games, usually packed. Lots of TVs, solid football watching venue.  The bar is full of TVs, too and has a shuffle board and pool table.  Always been a good, casual, and fun atmosphere every time I've gone.  I was just at Zipps this past weekend, and I miss those wings already!!

Great atmosphere. Superstition coffee I'd located at this site. They small batch roast their beans on site. So, rich and deep flavor in their espresso roast.   The cafe is great, lots of choices. I had the eggs Benedict for breakfast. Good size portion. Lots if feat options for salads and picnic type foods for eating outside in picnic tables, or lay out a blanket and enjoy a real country picnic!   The cafe and seating get full, and seating can be scarce!

This review is well overdue.  I live in San Diego, and was visiting in Arizona for the weekend, and wanted to find a nice place to have brunch with my boyfriend.  Hopped onto the Yelp! app, and based on location and Yelp! reviews, Cork had all the makings of a fabulous brunch.  Made reservations through OpenTable app, and off we went on a blazing hot Sunday morning in the suburban glory of Chandler, AZ.  If you're looking for urban hipster patio people watching scene, a la Scottsdale, you will not find it at Cork. Cork is in the middle of a strip mall in suburbia (which means, ample and free parking). AND as a constantly traveling foodie, it is well worth a trip to the PHX metro burbs.  Upon walking in, we were impressed from start to finish - the décor, the reception from the host and wait staff, bottomless bellinis, and of course, the food.  I favor savory over sweet, and we decided on trying the green chili pork tostada and the big biscuit.  The tostada is a layered concoction of green chili pork, refried beans, salsa, and cheese between fried corn tortillas, topped with scrambled eggs and drizzled with more salsa.  The buttermilk cheddar biscuit is topped with scrambled eggs, bacon, and grilled black forest ham, with a hearty smothering of gravy.  We both agreed that while the biscuit tasted good, it was a bit lacking.  The tostada was by far one of the best breakfasts I've ever had in my life, period.  The portions are very big, which had us lingering there for a pretty long time.  But we never felt hurried or rushed by the wait staff.  In the end, we were defeated by the entrees, and just couldn't finish either of them.  Cork was a thoroughly enjoyable experience for brunch, and hope to make a visit for dinner there soon.

Came in just as they opened on a Saturday afternoon. I'm new to Arizona, and eager to discover new places and make new "faves"  They didn't have anything cooked for turo-turo combination meals, and could only order from their full entree menu, which is pretty pricey for filipino food.  I am a big fan of sisig. My favorite sisig is from the now closed Betchay's in San Diego. So, I'm putting Gingerroot's sisig to the challenge. And at $15 for the entree, the expectations are high. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The sisig was extremely greasy, and chewy. The lumpia shanghai was good. Golden brown, crispy, and not greasy.

We had no prior knowledge about Brio, and decided to check it out because had a free appetizer coupon.  I'm curious if Brio is owned by or related to The Cheesecake Factory because the interior and ambiance is very similar.  We didn't have to wait very long to be seated.  We were seated outside, where there are heat lamps (cold this time of year in Arizona). We chose the bruschetta sampler for our appetizer - each  and every one was delicious. Brio is a bit pricier than say, Olive Garden, the appetizer itself was $15, but relatively reasonable considering the food quality, service, and restaurant ambiance.  We both chose pasta dishes. The serving sizes are hearty, and food was good.  Have never been for happy hour, but sounds worth checking out!!  Even though Brio has the cookie cutter chain restaurant feel, the service and food was good, and enjoyable will definitely go back.

Came here for a rare date night. It came highly recommended by several people, so we decided to give it a try. There was some slight confusion at the bar while waiting for our table. It wasn't clear whether or not there was a waiter or drinks were ordered directly from the bar. I don't remember getting the complimentary bread mentioned by other Yelpers, but in the end, that wasn't such a bad thing. We had the calamari appetizer as recommended by our server. It was delicious. Salads came with our entreees. And the portions were huge. I ordered the Clams over fettuccine with basil Pomodoro Sauce (picture posted) and my husband had the veal parmigian. I ate and ate til I couldn't eat anymore, and it didn't even look like I made a dent in the serving! I made sure to save room for their tiramasu, and was glad I did. I normally have a rule about eating seafood as leftovets, but it was still delicious the next day! The service was great. Other than the bar confusion, good experience. They have a pretty extensive menu, so I look forward to going back and trying more.

I came strictly for gelato. Intrigued by their cafe. Would like to try an espresso drink from here. I had the pistachio gelato. Sampled the straciatella..which was good, too. Just had a hankering for pistachio that night. Service was extremely warm and friendly. Family owned. Felt like I was at a friend's house, just chatting, and eating gelato. *Update* I've been here a couple more times from my original/first visit.  The gelato, service and family feel have been consistent.  Adding their affogato to my "to do" list.

Meh. I feel bad writing a bad review of a locally owned business.  But, the cupcakes just weren't very good - especially when you're paying premium price for cupcakes - one expects something amazing.  I would've been better off just buying cupcakes from Costco.

I've officially been to North once, but unofficially twice. The first was through trying brunch leftovers my husband brought home (The Pig pizza and Short rib gnocchi) and the 2nd I had to try for myself first hand. So first thing, parking lot is small. We happened to have reservations as they were opening, so it wasn't a problem. They have complimentary valet, kinda weird for such a small lot. But helpful. Interior is clean farmhouse rustic. I loved the family style table we were seated at, wish I could've taken that table home with us. Definitely great for groups, great for babies/kids. There is also a beautiful bar area, if its just a party of one or two. Now, for the food, that's really what u go for right? Ambiance is great and all, but what about the food? Top to bottom delicious, creative and executed to perfection.  Brunch Cocktail, first on the menu, The Red Rooster. An italian spin on a brunch favorite. Bloody mary with freshly crumbled parmesan mixed throughout and decorated with caprese. Caprese? Yes, one leaf of basil, tomato, and mozzarella. It sucks that I've never come up with this combination on my own. Bloody mary = tomato, italian = tomato, cheese, basil. Simple, creative, delicious. I would definitely get this again OR dare even try it at home.  Our chosen appetizers - zucca chips, bread board and custard filled donuts... is that a lot for appetizers, well yes, but that's not the point. Friends highly recommended the zucca chips, which I was more than willing to try even though I had no idea what they were. As it turns out, it isn't some exotic delicacy. Just fried zucchini. I don't say that lightly though because these were not the TGIFridays chunky cut, breaded, and fried zucchini. Zucca chips, were exactly that, chip-style - thinly sliced, slightly crispy, lightly salted, mini-zucchini goodness. Bread board has house-made rustic bread. Light, soft, airy on the inside with an crunchy outer crust. The usual thinly sliced charcuterie, cheese, olives, spiced mixed nuts, and a sweet chutney. Again, simple - but done well. Now, the unexpected we're the custard filled donuts. The very first menu item is pastries, choice of cinnamon rolls or custard filled donuts. We went with donuts. An order comes with 3, we got 2 orders. And they were nice enough to accommodate us with +1 for our party of 7. The donuts were unexpected because one, they are kinda hidden in the menu, and two - this place just screams savory - not sweet, but these little donuts (donut holes), crispy fried dough, dusted with powdered sugar, moist inside with a creamy lemon custard. That custard was so good, we were scraping it from the plate after having devoured our little tasty donut ball.  I was impressed with the short rib gnocchi i tasted from leftovers last week. Following that theme, I selected the short rib hash for my entree. I was not disappointed. Usually, my gripe,with hash - is the hash part. Usually too much potato. Not here. Perfect amount of short rib to potato. The hash was soft potato cubes with red peppers and onions. The short rib, moist and fall apart tender. All topped with poached egg. The egg yolk was soft but not runny. I would've preferred a runny egg, but did not affect overall taste. Buttered Toasted bread served on the side was so good. Toasted bread? Really - so good. One side was purposely burnt and it just worked.  It's a 45 minute drive, but will definitely come back -  gotta try more of the menu. Thanks to our friends for introducing us to North Fattoria Italiana. I don't even know what Frattoria means, but doesn't really matter. It is just good.

I had been hearing so much about Postino's, but was too lazy to drive out to The west valley for a wine bar... That's a long drive home... But when Postino's opened their downtown Gilbert location, I was excited.  I've only gone during Happy Hour for their bottle of wine and bruschetta board special, and that has never disappointed. I have yet to try ay other food, and they also have brunch on the weekends.  The servers don't wear any uniforms, and a different one is always coming to your table to help you. It's not a bad thing, but sometimes just confusing.  The interior is trendy and hip tables and living room style outdoor seating. They play the music LOUD, which is unusual for a wine bar (although the Living Room, wine bar in Chandler does the same), and since the inside of the place is all concrete and metal, it echoes like crazy. I always sit outside.  If you're not into wine, they do have beer, and I believe it's a decent selection. I just don't drink beer here.  One of these days I will venture and try some of their other food selections and brunch.

Finally made it for brunch. Was not disappointed. I had the French toast. Went on a sunny, beautiful Saturday morning. The sliding glass doors were all open. Great food, service, and experience.

I came here in the middle of the afternoon. It's used to be a cheesesteak shop, which has since moved around the corner somewhere. Coming to Big B's middle of the afternoon, place was Dead sober, empty. I was the only customer, bad sign #1. The girl at the counter looked bored out of her skull, and pretty unenthusiastic in her service and demeanor overall. not unpleasant though.   Tip: If u order water, get bottled water. The water from the fountain machine tastes like... Lead or some kind of metal. It almost made me vomit.   I got 2 sliders and a bag of chips. The sliders were, "meh" - better off getting cheeseburger from McDonald's.. The place has a new name, new signs, but food is still not very good. They do have cheesesteaks, but since I'm guessing that the same recipe/methods are used for their cheesesteaks, I didn't get one. I don't think I'll be coming back again, not even for late night greasy food. Don't know how this place survives, maybe it's location alone is the reason.

Driving through Phoenix and it happened to be lunch time. I was at the red light sitting at the intersection where Gadzooks is located, did a quick Yelp lookup and decided to try it. I'm glad I did, because it was really good. I had the 2 enchilada plate. One short rib and the other chicken tomatillo. Both were good. They are super stuffed with meat, no skimping. After choosing my tortilla, all corn for me. (U can choose a half corn half flour tortilla), pick your filling - they have meat and vegetarian options. Cheese and sauce topping. Then its put in the fire oven briefly to warm and melt the cheese. Choose salsa and other condiment toppings and voila (or olé! In this case)  I was there during the lunch rush. People were constantly streaming in and the line moved quickly and food served quickly. Friendly staff. Great food. Nice easy parking on site.   If you have little ones, there are booster seats and high chairs but no changing tables in the restroom.   Glad I took a chance on this place and would definitely try again! Maybe soup on a cold day in Phoenix....

Super friendly staff. Knowledgeable about their menu, great suggestions for a relative newbie to Dutch Bros. Got the white zombie dutch freeze with an extra single shot of espresso. They even gave me the extra shot complimentary. Score! Love their drive thru!

A beautiful open, contemporary space. The prices are a bit higher than what you would find from small mom/pop Thai restaurants. But this is more of a modern, fine dining experience. But not stuffy by any means.  There is a full bar, seating is spacious, you're not crowded and smushed with other tables. Outdoor tables and heat lamps. Wait staff was friendly. And overall, the food was very good, so I don't feel like I was paying just for ambiance alone.  Came for lunch based on a recommendation from a friend to dine at the previous life of this restaurant, Latitude 8 in Downtown Chandler, only to discover it had closed and reopened anew as Chao.   While there is a lunch menu, there is no lunch special. I went all out for myself for lunch. Pork dumplings, Panang Beef Curry, and Sticky rice with taro ice cream for dessert.   Quick review of each. Pork dumplings: pork filling itself didn't have much in flavor. Wonton was perfect soft, not chewy or mushy. Just a nice slight pan fry crisp. Topped with toasted minced garlic. Dipping sauce very tasty. So the overall combination of flavor made it very tasty.  Panang Beef Curry: the beef texture was okay. Some parts a little tough, beef could probably be softer, more tender. But flavor was amazing. I wanted to drink the sauce, bathe in it! Perfect in consistency, spice, taste. Dessert: they didn't have mango, but I love taro too so I wasn't disappointed. The rice could be a little creamer in texture. The toasted sesame seeds gives a nice subtle contrast to the sweetness, and gives you the illusion of a crust to the taste.   Great experience, will definitely come back, and recommend to others. In fact, I already have recommended it!

Bay area based sandwich shop that has expanded into Arizona. I have NEVER been disappointed with anything I've ordered at Ike's Menage a Trois was the first sandwich I tried at the Oakland A's Spring training stadium, then the Damon Bruce, the Paul Reubens, and today's new adventure - the Blocked, with green pesto. Service is always friendly. Sandwiches take a little while to make, not a quickie Subway sandwich here. The price is significantly higher than a Subway sandwich, but it's quite made up for in taste, size, and quality. The decor is kind of dated, but no biggie. The music is usually blaring 90s and early 2000s R&B...always throwback music that brings back good memories. Dirty sauce and Dutch Crunch Roll, PHEN OM EN AL!

First time to Zinburger. There was a 30 minute wait for a table, but luckily there was room at th bar to wait. We had drinks at the bar. Luckily, we weren't starving and were meeting friends and looking forward to chatting before our meal.  I had the Signature Zinburger. That burger was so juicy, it damn near melted in my mouth! The flavor combo of this burger is amazing. The double truffle fries are crispy, truffly perfection.   For being as busy as it was, service was great, and timing of food and drinks was great. Four stars because the size of the fries basket is pretty small, considering the price of $6 a basket.

This is only my second visit, but I was impressed with the service, taste and quality of this place that I came the very next day to try something else. First visit, #5 Hong Kong BBQ Pork bánh mì with Thai Iced tea. 2nd visit shaken beef sandwich, #7.  Wowwww, that #7, was meary deliciousness. A must try! The service was just as friendly and prompt. Restaurant was clean and fully stocked in all areas with napkins, etc. Bathroom is super clean and even has a cute changing table. So far consistently good.  A 4 star rating only bc they don't have phô, but there are so many other options that I could get phô elsewhere...

Like most the reviews for this location, my experience was pretty much the same. Came in on a Wednesday night at around 5pm. It wasnt that busy, there was no wait for a table, which was a plus considering every other place nearby had a 45-60 minute wait.  After waiting almost 10 minutes, the waiter took my drink order and never brought my sweet tea. I was too busy trying to keep my two toddlers behaved that I didn't even bother to ask the waiter for it. When the waiter brought the drinks (waters) he dropped them at the table as quickly as he could without asking if we needed anything else, or saying anything for that matter. We only ordered two entrees. Chicken fingers with waffles and chicken and biscuits. It took 45 minutes after placing our order before we got our food. The waiter didn't check on us during that time didn't keep us informed on the status of our order, didn't refill waters or get us drinks. The tables around us were all waiting around too. We were right about to get up and just walk out since all we had after an hour of sitting was water. But of course, just as we're getting ready to do so, the food arrived. The food tasted on par with what I've had at other locations. I like LoLo's, and maybe willing to give this location another shot. I hope they have better service next time around.
