I LOVE this place. The marijuana theme isn't kid-friendly though, so DONT bring your kids. Just bring it home to them.  Their subs are really tasty, the theme (for adults) is hilarious, the people are friendly, and are reasonably priced.  Also, the potato salad is fantastic!

The atmosphere is great here. They had a HUGE wine selection and a great menu. The food was tasty too. However, the waitress wasn't very attentive and the portions were tiny in comparison to the prices. I paid $35 for their low-carb option and 2 glasses of wine. Everyone else in our group loved their food as well. I think you could get a better bang for your buck elsewhere, though.

This bar is the divey-est of dive bars, but it's a great bar. The music is decent, the bartenders &amp; owner are really friendly, the drinks are cheap (and strong). Most of the people that go into the bar are regulars, and those that are not, are treated as if they were.  However, it's not the most clean place in the hood. That, and the cash only schtic is kind of a pain in the ass if you have no cash &amp; you're going there on a whim (or aren't prepared).  Make sure to make your mark in the bathroom.. bring a sharpie!

I typically order from here for delivery... and boy they're FAST! They have decent Chinese food (nothing out of the ordinary), and their prices are pretty reasonable.

There's one word to describe this bar: seedy. It's the perfect place to have a good priced beer and people watch. There's all sorts of random people that go there... last time I was there a seedy homeless tweaker asked me for $3 so he could get a beer. The bar tender shook her head no, and I told him that I had no more money. The guy left, and we spent the last 20 minutes I was there making fun of him.  The nice parts of this bar: cheap drinks, good company (when they're not drunk as a skunk or doped up on who knows what), good people watching, you can still smoke in the bar, and pool tables.

The ONLY reason why I am giving this 2 stars is because the food was amazing. That was probably the perk of the whole night.  I had a larger party for my birthday, so I had to put my credit card down for the reservation. I had a feeling the whole group wouldn't show up on time, and unfortunately, the didn't, however, everyone arrived within 20 minutes of the reservation. I was the first to arrive, and in the begining the waiter seemed attentive. It was packed, so I was excited. As the night went on, the patrons had trickled out, and I think our waiter checked out....  My last friends that showed up had to wait 30 minutes for the waiter to even come back around to order drinks. At that point, we ordered a round of drinks & some appetisers. It took about 45 minutes for the appetisers to show up, and at that point, we were STARVING, so we ate them up as we ordered our entrees. The apps were really good!  However, this is when we all start losing our patience.... because it took us 2 HOURS to get our entrees!!!!! The waiter went MIA for almost an hour.... We asked the hostess where he was and if we could do something about it, and she had mentioned "did you talk to a manager?".....  Isn't us complaining a hostess' cue to get the manager over? Apparently not... because the manager was MIA, too.  I was about 2 minutes away from getting up and leaving, when our entrees came... FINALLY!  Then waited another hour for our check, in which they're not able to split into separate checks... apparently.... and there's no ATMs around the area, either... apparently.... *eyeroll*  My friends had babysitters who they had to over pay because dinners don't typically last 4 hours in a restaurant that's half empty where you pay $40/plate.... on a Thursday.... with a reservation....   I have heard nothing but great things about this place, but from this experience, I'd be hard pressed to come back.

I have gone in there several times for my sick dog, Lola. I have had nothing but friendly service & good prices. The vets here are amazingly friendly and took care of my dog really well. They genuinely care about the well being of my dog as much as I do. They also have been really responsive when it comes to getting an appointment in same day too. I have to say that by far, this has been one of the best places to get my dog checked out and healthy.  They also treat cats too, but my experience has only been with my dog.

I love their hummus. It's like none other. They're not expensive for a sit-down restaurant. Pitas are HUGE... exceptional flavor, but typical combination of ingredients on most items.  The best part: it's right off of the light rail!!

The pizza tastes okay. It's not the greatest pizza on the planet, and their prices are average. It's not much for "New York" style pizza. Their large pizza is HUGE, but their crust is flavorless. Their wings are okay, but not great either.   Their delivery times are off. Sometimes they'll tell you 45 minutes and they'll be an hour, or they'll be 10 minutes early. It's weird. Sometimes they just wont answer their phone. Sometimes they wont tell you when they'll be there. Once, they actually forgot part of my order. In terms of customer service, they're less than stellar... for sure.  Why do I keep eating there? My boss wouldn't eat anything else! I think if I have another Gus's pizza, i'll yack! I would recommend Pizza Hut over Gus's... any day.

When their products are not on sale, they're a bit on the pricey side, however their store is generally inexpensive once their discounts come into play. I love that they have a TON of different sized stretched canvas. They have a ton of supplies you can use too, some out of the ordinary.   The nice part is that it's by ASU. That's also the bad part too. I have a feeling that their prices are a bit expensive generally in the off-school season because of the ASU students. So typically I try and avoid going there around those times. However, the best time to buy is when school starts or a new semester starts.

I went here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Saturday night. I got there around 8pm and there was a good crowd already. We managed to get a table right next to the heaters because it was one of the few spots with one. The waiter was attentive and the crowd was pleasant. As soon as it was 10pm, the crowd got fairly large, and the waiter still came around often. I was impressed! The only problem I had was the drinks were on the watered down side... I like a little more Jack with my Coke.

I love this place. They have a great sub called the "Silver City" which I find is a great alternative to the "Motherload." They're a little on the pricey end for subs, but I find it's worth it.  The only complaints that I have is that they sometimes dont answer their phone when it's busy, therefore I feel awkward placing an order on an answering machine. That, and when they're busy, it feels like it takes forever for the food to come and they never give me ETAs.

I loved the atmosphere. The beer was good. My date and I split the gigondor plate of appetizers and it was really good. I doubt the sliders are kobe, however, I dont know if I cared. (When I think of sliders, I think of White Castle... if you want them to be "sliders", make them with cheap beef, not Kobe, or call them mini burgers). Anywhoop... we sat at the bar. The bartender was nice & was attentive enough without being annoying. Overall, I enjoyed myself there. I think I might go there more often and try out more of the menu. This location is WAY better than the location on Mill, without a doubt.

The food was great, the bar tenders and waitresses are great.   I just went there for dinner with some friends.  I had the pesto chicken pasta and it was fantastic. I also tried my friends wings that were great as well. It was a lot of fun to hang out there, but the prices for the beers were a bit much. If I went during happy hour, perhaps I would have been more drunk and more willing to pay $43 bucks (w/o tip) for 4 drinks and my dinner.   Obviously I went there for dinner, so there weren't many sports games to be played on the 500 TVs (yes, this is a slight exaggeration, but there are a lot) in the bar. I'd imagine this place would be a BLAST to go to during football season. I'll have to give it a shot then.

I was wondering around the complex trying to find a place to eat, when I found Jersey Mike's Subs in the corner of the strip-mall area. I was expecting a sub shop somewhat along the lines of one of their competitors in terms of price and taste. Unfortunately, neither price or taste compared to any of their competitors.  I waited 15+ minutes (I'll be a little lenient because it was lunch time), but the way the line grew, I was expecting something more since it seemed like a popular place to be. There were at least 20 customers in line and only 3 - 4 people working, at most... The guy who assembled the sandwiches needed a helper because it took him for-ev-er to get all the junk on the sandwich. But, I only gripe because I am very impatient. Especially during my lunch hour at work.  The price was ridiculous... $10 for a regular sub, chips and small drink. I ordered the club "Mike's Way" and took it back to work to eat. I got to work to try and eat the sub, which was a 5 minute drive away, and part of the sub was soggy from all the vinegar/oil that was on there. The other part of the bread was a little tough. The flavor? What flavor? It had bacon on it for God's sakes! It should have tasted like SOMETHING... nada... I mainly tasted the mound of vinegar that was on the thing.   Needless to say, I didn't feel this place will be worth a second visit.

I love this place. I came in one day as a walk-in about 6 months ago and I have been hooked ever since. Keep in mind, sometimes they get really busy and do not have walk-in times available, so call ahead for an appointment, but the ladies that work here know what they're doing.  Specifically, Amy, is the best! I have had her "do whatever she wants" to my hair and she's done an amazing job. She did an amazing job on my highlights, gave me suggestions for a style, and she went to town. I came in looking drab, and now I look fab thanks to her.   On the down side, it's a bit pricey, but I'd rather pay the extra money for the reassurance that I will look great when I leave. I am definitely a repeat customer.

I LOVE Jimmy Johns and ever since I found out they have come out to Arizona, I have been hooked! I typically go to this location because it's closest to my work. The place gets really busy during lunch so if you're in a hurry, I would set aside an extra 5 minutes to get your sandwich made. The service is a little lacking when it's busy, but that's because the workers have no breathing room... and neither do the customers by the receiving end of the line. I guess the layout of the store is a little odd, but it seems to work out, for the most part.  I highly recommend the Italian Night Club. It's like the smaller version of the ever-so-tasty Gargantuan.   Now... if there were more locations closer to Gilbert, I would be a happy woman!

I started off here early int the night to originally meet up with a fairly large group of people for the UFC night. We got there early to ensure a table for the over 10 people group I was with. At first it started off alright. I'd have to wait 10 minutes after my beer was gone to see the waitress who eventually forgot my beer, then came back with it another 20 minutes after she realized she forgot it. I was trying to be understanding since our group was so large and everyone was ordering drinks and appetizers. Then, the crowd got large. I was annoyed to not see our waitress for over 30 minutes and so I went to the bar. There were 50 guys at the bar and they all were served before me. It was more than frustrating because I was there waiting before most of them. Later in the night, I managed to run into an old coworker and hung out with him and a group of whom I'd call fairly attractive young guys.... they got service every 10 minutes or less. It was insane! My former coworker was ordering cheap beer and no food and managed to get better service than the group of people I was with ordering premium drinks and appetizers! Apparently it takes having a penis to get service around there!! WTF?! The only reason why I'd CONSIDER coming back to this place is because I found out (2 hours after being here because the waitress never told us specials) Coors Lights were $2.... Guys obviously love going there because the waitresses are fairly attractive, but the bar was a sausage fest, for sure, which normally would be a good thing for a single girl, but good luck getting any form of service!

I fell in love with this place the first time I went there. I ended up getting the Gang ka ree and was impressed that I got to choose the spiciness of the dish (since I can be kind of a wuss with spicy food). I have had fresh Thai food made by some Thai friends when I lived in Australia, and this was very comparable.   We took a seat in the restaurant and were barely able to find an open seat. The place was packed. The restaurant's atmosphere wasn't spectacular, however, it's better than some places that also do delivery/takeout.  It was worth the wait though.   In the future, I plan on ordering take out & I hope they deliver to my house.

I came here a few weeks ago on a date. It was a great first date atmosphere for me on a Saturday night because of the live music. It was entertaining. We sat at the bar and got our drinks from the bar tender. At first, she was great (asking if we wanted refills when she saw our glasses were empty) but as the night went on, she got more and more distracted and less attentive. I would have blamed it on the large crowd, but there was no one ordering drinks around us and she was talking to a waiter for most of the time. I was disappointed. The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars was because the live entertainment was THAT good. It was one man singing and playing his guitar. He sang a lot of songs the crowd knew (90s alternative mostly) and was really good at it. I was impressed by him, for sure.

I loved this bar when I first came in and the music was fantastic! The waitresses were lousy, but I figured we could go up to the bar to get our drinks.  I ended up spending $50 on drinks and food, but when I go to look at my checking account today, they had 2 new pending charges on my card - one for $1 and one for $64.75! WTH?!   .... now I have to go through the troubles of contacting my bank, getting a new debit card issued and going through a dispute with them over the new charges they put on my card when I haven't been in scottsdale since saturday!  I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!   Word to the wise: check your card balance when you get home and for about a week later.... someone over there is being shady as hell and needs to get FIRED and/or ARRESTED!

This bar is awesome! If you have gone here more than once, the bartenders remember your name. They're all really friendly, the drinks are inexpensive, and there's a bunch of types of entertainment: from karaoke, darts & pool tables. Sometimes the regulars put on a put luck or a chili cook off. The best part is they have a "designated driver" ready to take you home for free on Friday and Saturdays... although you need to tip the driver (obviously). It's definitely a hole-in-the-wall type of bar. It's a tiny area in a strip mall, so it's easy to miss. Almost all of the patrons are regulars too. The only downfall: limited drunken munchies. There's no food available, that I know of.
