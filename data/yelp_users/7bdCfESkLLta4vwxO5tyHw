This is a sports bar owned by "legendary" native Alice Cooper. They are now known for the "Big Unit" ginormous hot dog.   It's good and fun for what it is. The staff is always pleasant, even with their painted eyes. The food is what it is, good and nothing fancy. It is just a fun place to take people or hang out when you need to be downtown.

We had our son her in Jan, so this is for Labor and Delivery, and post care.   All I can say is, we had exactly everything we could hope for. All the nurses were wonderful, especially labor and delivery.   The post rooms were way too small, but they worked. I also heard they are remolding the rooms soon.   The cafeteria was dated, but the food worked. Fries were the go to for me during this time.   We loved our experience and would have our next here. Dr. Candice Woods is the best OBGYN on the face of planet earth :)

My family was driving through Phoenix and told me they were stopping here. I was confused at first, as I had never seen this place, and it appeared to be I. A neighborhood. Don't let that fool you, just go.   Everything was delicious. We got various different chicken biscuit sandwiches and burgers. Fries were great. Cole slaw was good, and I don't even like cole slaw. Very heaven food, may die after, but worth it at least once.

Let's just sum it up quickly. Wait was terrible on a late Thursday night. Finally seated, 15 mins before they took our order. Food came out, cold and or overcooked. Only good thing was our waiter, he was doing his best. Will not be returning with all the late night choices down Central.

If it was not for the old snooty hostess, this place would get 5 stars.   Brought clients here for lunch and the service from out waiter was 5 star! Prompt and courtesy, always on top of our needs.   We ordered the rib-eye and chicken sandwich. Both our items were very good and filling. Their ranch and honey mustard are spot on!   Will definitely be back.

The remodel is so nice, really digging the modern look.   Been coming for breakfast burritos, and they have not let me down! A little pricey for a breakfast burrito, but very good and worth it.   Wait is also a little frustrating, but again, the burrito is very good.

We stayed here over the Fourth of July weekend.   It was PACKED at check in, and it moved moderately slow. The check in staff was great however, and they were working as fast as possible. Seemed to be more due to the people checking in.   Room is not amazing, but it is large. Most people at this resort are there for the water park, so the room was not a big deal. View in the mountain suites sucked.   The water park was great! It really was not as packed as I thought it was going to be. We always found ideal seats, and we never felt overwhelmed. Food is a little pricey, but that was expected.   I would do it again if the price was right. Defienetly would not pay full price, but we got a deal.

Maybe I had not eaten Sonic in a long time...maybe it was a full moon...IDK!?   However, they get 4 stars from me. The food was fast and fresh, exactly how it should be! The young man who brought it was SOOOOOOOO polite....my friend ran back in and gave him a tip in front of his manager...btw....how strange is it to walk into a Sonic!? So weird....nonetheless...great all around that night.

Lived up to all the others I have been too!   Food tasted great, fresh, and came out quickly. Portions are always plentiful.   The waitress was very very nice and very good.   This one was a little awkward walking into....at first we thought it was closed for the new year.

The wait was a little long, and it really seemed like they went out of order when they started seating. I went up and expressed my concern, and then we were immediately seated.   The waitress was very personable and friendly. She quickly got our drinks and orders. She appreciated that we were ready to go with our orders as soon as we sat.   We were able to share a dish and salad, and we still got stuffed!   The food was better than Olive Garden, and even tasted more legit and fresh.

Service was great!   Nick was a fantastic waiter!   The food.....meh....The Keg is definitely better. We gave this place a shot after hearing great things about it.   I can't put my finger on it, there was just nothing special about it, especially for its higher price range. The Filet was just ok, and a little chewy. The truffle mashed potatoes were good.   My wife got the french toast brunch special, and it was not good at all. She did not eat but one bite. She said it reminded her of bread pudding.   Needless to say, we will keep going to The Keg for our steak house dinners.

If you are in downtown Gilbert, this is a place to hit up. The food is good, the service is friendly, and the atmosphere is cool. There are so many options in downtown, so if you are confused, just go to Liberty. Liberty has so many options in one place.

This place was charming and cozy.   Very simple menu and simple food. We had the waffle and breakfast sandwich. Nothing amazing, but very good and filling.   The service was great and the staff was all friendly. They also use big glasses requiring less refills and waiting. They even use really cool frosted glasses for the milk.   We will definitely be back here again.

This is a service department review.   Ask for David, he's awesome. He really did all he could do to help us out with our Jeep. He fought for us with his manager, and our warranty company. Parts that were not covered by warranty, they did for us at no charge. They also covered our rental car. It was a nice experience. Would defiantly take our car back to David.   He would get 5 stars, but he's a little hard to get a hold of. He makes up for it in kindness.

Don't get me wrong, Raven was sweet!   The process took way to long though. Just to upgrade and get set up took HOURS! We literally had enough time to pick up a prescription, eat lunch, and they still weren't done when we got back. Once home we had to erase and re-set up again. Will not be returning to this location.

This place is in a strip mall, but do not judge a book by its cover, it is cute inside.   My gf had wine and I had the Chicken Parmigiana. She enjoyed her glass of wine and my plate was HUGE! Two big pieces of chicken, and it was very good. The bread was also delicious and loaded with butter and garlic. Service was on key too.   I would definitely go back.

*STOP SEARCHING BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT AND GO*   OK....Service was out of this world! From sitting down and immediately having water, to drinks being brought right away. Never an empty glass. All servers were so happy and polite.   Food was put of this world....from citrus chicken to chow mein. Also, how did they make fried rice taste like heaven!? Seriously, I could not stop. Fresh and not greasy. HUGE portions.   Came in at 630ish on a Friday night and was empty. Within an hour it was jammed packed. We met George!!! Not only does he walk around and talk to customers, HE WORKS! From serving to bussing. Blew me away.   The Yelp check-in deal is over a year old. He is having some trouble with Yelp. He explained his issue, and it sounds legit. He did honor it because we came all the way from Chandler.   WE WILL BE BACK ASAP!!   FYI....taste amazing left over and even cold. That's legit.

Just don't get it. It is croweded, the staff is rude, and the food is not that good.   Maybe it is because I am over the good ole college days, but just is not my cup of tea.   The food was ok. The drinks were simple. The waitress was rude and not attentive. It was loud and packed to the brim. No way to squeeze into the bar without someone yelling at you because they think you are taking their spot.   Parking is just dumb. Seriously, rent all the empty lots around you and allow you customers some normal parking.   Only go because friends ask.

I get that hotels do not like when you get a great deal through Priceline, but what this hotel did was ridiculous.   After a full day of helping us move, my mother and niece arrived around midnight to check in to their room. Upon arrival they were told that, "Priceline should not have agreed to the deal, and we have to send you somewhere else." So, at 1 am my mother and young niece are driving through shady Phoenix trying to find this Aloft they sent them to. Again, my mother is not from here, and she had been helping us move all day. She called me scared and frustrated, and we finally got her there and checked in. Now, 45 mins away from where she needed to be, she could sleep. I find this appalling and ridiculous. I will never give this hotel, or any other Sheraton brand our business. This is why we stick to Marriot.   Furthermore, I will never give Priceline my business again either. I know better, but I thought it was worth a shot.

Went her for my wife's birthday.....first one as a married couple....so I wanted the flowers to be awesome...and they were!!  Bobbie was very nice, and he personally took me into the fridge to pick out the exact flowers I wanted. They were delivered Tuesday, and they still look great Friday!   They also send an email confirmation when the flowers are delivered. He got them there right on time, no problems when asked to have them there before 2.   Will always use Bobbie's Flowers from now on.

This second review is really unfortunate for me to have to post. I ordered flowers about a week ago via the internet directly from their website for Vday. Just today I guess they decided to process my order. I requested that they please deliver them before 2 pm (as my wife gets off at 2). Last time I ordered in store from the owner, and he had no problem getting them there before 2 pm. This time I was called and told they could not guarantee it, unless I paid another $25. I'm already paying outrages prices just to deliver flowers on this day, I'm not adding $25 on top of it. Especially pre-ordering weeks in advance. As I did with Sherri Berries and there was not extra charge. Sad to say, I cancelled my order and will take my business elsewhere.

I received an email from the owner schooling me on why flowers are expensive on Valentines Day...um....No duh!? That was not my point. My point was that I ordered them in advance, and then my order was not processed for over a week. Then I received a call informing me of the $25. I should have been made aware before hand.   Also,  if you want to keep calling websites "BOGUS" and claim that with you we get quality, you have to deliver quality on every level. From website, to ordering, to responding to unhappy customers. When these BOGUS websites have screwed up an order, they have always fixed it with no questions asked. They also inform me of delivery times and fees up front. I am all for local, so don't get me wrong. I was really happy when I found your shop, but now you have left a sour taste in my mouth.

Simple....Rude pretentious hipsters.   I don't understand it. I was so hesitant on coming here because I was afraid of this.   I walked in, no one was in line. So I walked up to the cash register. Stood for a minute while the girl rang someone up. Finally a young man helped me, but first he just felt the need to educate me at how it works at LUX. Instead of, "Hi, what can I get for you!?" I got a, "Just so you know the line starts back at the glass, what can I get for you?" Really!? Is this real life!? How about the line starts wherever the heck your customer wants it to start, because I am paying your paycheck. Nonetheless, I was now at the cash register and realized he didn't ask how I wanted my tea. I then asked  the girl at the register if I can get creme in my tea, and the girl annoyingly told me I could do it myself. Stood and waited for my tea, and realized they must not call out your order at LUX. I walked up to the register (because why would you have a place to pick up your drinks?) and asked if these were mine, which took 3 tries before she yelled at me, "yeah!"   Now was my drink amazing? Absolutely not.   So with that said, they will never get my business again.

Sometimes I think, "Why can't I just leave a 5 star review and overlook every little detail?" I try so hard...but I am a yelper.   So, we came late at night, and I am happy they had no qualms about seating us. The service started out great, and I was so impressed, but then it slowly declined. Drinks got slower, and our waiter became strangely rude and snappy. Then our chef (whatever you call them) came out and started his show. He was really funny and cheerful, but a little inappropriate and used a lot of sexual innuendos with the females. Now, it was not to the point that you wanted to punch him in the face, but it was just hitting the line of too much.   Now, as he was doing his show, he broke a bowl on the grill where he was cooking our rice. I guess the show must go on, because he just scooted the bowl off and kept cooking. Needless to say, there was clay bowl in my rice that I kept spitting out.   The food was good, excluding the clay bowl rice.   Would I come back? Probably not.

It's good quick "Asian" cuisine. I have never had a bad meal here, and I have always had great service. No complaints here. Again....its "Asian". Don't come here expecting legit Asian food. However, it's feels a little lighter than regular Chinese places.

This place was tucked back facing a park of some sort and an awesome LOVE statue. The atmosphere was awesome and candles were every where. We went on a Sunday night and it was pretty quiet. Service was great and they were all super friendly.   FOOD!    I had The Chicken sandwich and added bacon and cheese. Twas good, needed a little flavor, but the honey mustard helped.   We also had the grilled cheese, twas tasty and very cheesy.   I had an Old Fashioned, and man o man, IT WAS BOMB! It is hard to find a place that even knows what an Old Fashioned is, let alone make a good one. Don Draper would approve.   Had a sundae....not so bomb....just you average sundae...flavorless whip cream.   Cheesecake was pretty good.   Prices were pretty awesome for the atmosphere it provides. They could charge more for the location and atmosphere.   It is easy to get lost. Most GPS take you to a parking garage...park in there and exit out of the NE corner. On your right will be a Mexican restaurant and AZ 88 is on your left.

This place is groooovy!!  We came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was slightly busy and kind of confusing. You order your food at the counter and then find a seat after they call your name out (during the day, not sure about the evening). We order the margarita pizza and it was bomb! Our friend has the BLT and it looked pretty good....she had no complaints. I had the potato salad and it was freaking delicious. Maybe I was smitten by the groovy atmosphere, but I love this joint.

The only mall we really go to. It is very nice, not necessarily what I would call "upscale." I mean, it is far from Mill....  Great selection of stores, and the center kiosk employees do not pester you, however the asian massage place will beg you to come into their dark creepy doors. Please just stay behind your counter, your 20 seconds (trial) slap down will not convince me.  Other than that, it is a mall! It is surrounded by great/no so great  restaurants of all different varieties.    I avoid this movie theater due to all the kids and young folk. There are nicer Harkins within minutes of this one.

Worst Chilies ever. Yes...it's true. At first I read these reviews and thought, " geez it can't be that bad." Then I experienced the worst chilies I had ever been to. All the waitresses seemed rushed and confused. There was a politeness, but just seemed very rushed. Then we waited 40 mins for our food. Once it came I asked for some onions....I got the box and check before I ever got the onions. No apologies from the waitress, it took calling the manager over to get an apology.   To top it off, the food made my wife sick last night.   Won't be returning to this location.

Do not get in the way of a sample table when they pull that steaming chimichanga out of the microwave, you will be trampled by drooling apes who haven't been fed for a week. They will take 2 samples, 1 for themselves and 1 for their "significant other". Also watch out for the hawks circling the aisle waiting for the samples to be done, they will poop on your head.   Don't go on weekends, it turns into a civil war. You leave a different person.   Other than that, we love Costco! I come home and sample everything I buy. I also love buying enough toilet paper for a large Mormon family, it's perfect for the 2 of us. I think I'm set for a year!

These people are a class act! After every other vet turned me away claiming to be too busy, they welcomed us in! They fit us right in and got us straight to a room. We had a small wait, but that is a given coming in without an appointment. They got our puppy all fixed up and got us out the door in 30 mins. They realized that she did not need a full assessment, and just needed a quick sanitary service. For this, they gave me a nice break of the cost. Even before the break, the cost was not bad at all for an emergency. I will be brining my dogs back here anytime we need a vet. They were all so friendly, polite, and helpful. From the front desk to the vet, they all were a 5 star act.

Fed up with Verizon, I crossed the street (literally) and went into this store today to sign up with Tmobile.   Due to some staffing issues, and it normally not being busy on Sundays, it was short staffed. It was like waves up people just pouring in. Giana and Jackie did such an amazing job. They kept everyone in pleasant moves and worked together so well as a team. The poor girls did not have a chance to breathe! I was so impressed, and I will always refer people to this store.

Beans were awesome!   Salsa was good.   Tortillas were good.  Enchilada sauce was good.   Carne Asada was ok. It was good, but a little overcooked.   Will make this our regular Mexican resteraunt.

Dr. Patel is the best GI I have ever had. It took many GI's to discover a good one. He truly took time to understand my condition, and treat my symptoms. He continues to care and show empathy for the struggle I have to go through at such a young age. He's always polite and kind. Never once has he shown a sign of arrogance.

I like Sals because I feel like I am walking into a legit Italian pizza joint. I love seeing Sal working hard in the back and talking with all his regular guest. It makes me wanna get to know Sal!   The service is always good, not great. The pizza is good, not great. The wings are GREAT!   Be prepared to wait, especially if you are a big group.   Great local business that I will continue to support. I will find a GREAT pizza on their menu.

So, this review is more based off of the service, not the food.   We walked in on a Saturday night after a full day of moving, ready to eat some pizza. It was busy, but not packed. I told the young lady how many and she said 25-30 mins. I then rudely blurted out, "that's dumb". It was the exhaustion, my apologize. However, it seemed to catch her off guard, and it worked. The 30 mins quickly turned into 5. There were empty tables for pete sake!   Once seated we were greeted by a friendly waiter. He was very nice, but I think he came by maybe 2 times after taking our order. They brought out pizza with no plates. I had to ask 3 different servers for things. The manager finally came by to clear off our table and offer us our check.   So, food was good. Service sucked.

Some people must not get out much.   Don't get me wrong, good was good. Enjoyed the fresh ingredients.   The line. Why have 2 windows, but have one closed at dinner time on a weekend? That's ridiculous.   Is it good?...yes.   Is it amazing?....no  Is it worth standing in line for.....eh  Everything seemed to lack flavor. It was good, but expected a little more spices and flavor. Healthy food doesn't have to be bland. I shouldn't have to dunk my sandwich in ketchup to add some flavor.

Every party has a pooper...and I guess that's me.   I just don't understand the rave reviews for this place. I wanted to love it.   My brioche egg sandwich/salad (practically had a plate full of arugula on it) was not that good. Then to pay $20+ for 2 and have it served on a styrofoam plate?   Thought, well maybe I will try the cookies. Bad idea...just not tasty.  Maybe just not my kind of place... Maybe it's all in my head... That's fine...but won't be in my belly ever again.

Good fresh food at a decent price  fries are so-so  Chips and salsa good....sometimes  The tortilla soup is awesome and different, made with coconut milk. Sounds weird, but delicious.

Wait was long, but not terrible.   Waitress was a doll.   Waited over 30 mins for our food. There was only 2 of us and we ordered chicken sandwich and chicken tenders. Not once did anyone give us an update or seem concerned.   Cheese sauce is good.  Food was bland.   Bill came and they tried to charge for a side of sauce that didn't show up until we finished eating, and chips that we requested because our original batch was half full.   Won't bother coming back.

Went to a "Margarita Class" and never recieved my fake certificate. Kinda dumb...but I did drive from Gilbert.   Drinks were OK...not a big selection....Food was ok....nothing amazing....nothing great...Yard House right across the way is much better.

I just don't understand places like this. Be unique and different, cool....but where does the customer service go? I don't care if you are trying to be a cool local hangout, you still need to be personable and friendly. Starbucks may be big business, but most of the time they treat me right.   Now for the product. It was a terrible Americano. I do not know what they put in it, but it was awfully sour and bitter.   The atmosphere is not pleasant and the seating is uncomfortable and industrial.

I am very picky with my hair and who cuts it...like....I will cut a fool if they mess up my hair...  but...for reals...I had a great haircut here by Krista. She really helped me figure out what style I was wanting, and was very patient...The whole staff was great, and they fit me in last minute.   They also carry great product here...which I did not know how great it was until I got home and my wife gave me the 411 on what I brought home.   So men....stop going to barbers because you are insecure and it makes you feel more "manly"....head over to this salon on Mondays and gets a discount on all mens cuts.

UPDATED AND UPGRADED!!!   This Sprouts has been greatly upgraded. They now have a large liquor selection and a full deli that serves Boars Head.   The shelves are so much larger and they added a lot of products.   There is always a lot of staff all around, sometimes too many it seems. Very helpful. I only had one bad experience, and the manager immediately addressed it.   Love this place!

They left the edge of my carpets dirty and my carpets soaking wet, it took days to dry out.   Then one day I thought I would be nice and have my wife's car detailed...They did a decent job, until she informed me that they stole her Ipod.

I have to admit, I did not try the food.   We walked out. It was a horrible atmosphere and HORRIBLE service. The waiter could not speak English. I am not being rude....but how do I ask any questions?   They served me soda that tasted like poison...now I am not some brat who just post negative dramatic reviews....except this one...but the soda was literally stomach wrenching...I do not know what it was.   My wife ordered water....that must have been scooped from the toilet.   If that is the quality of their beverages, then I do not even want to know the quality of their food.

Great good and great happy hour. The kind of screwed things up at another location, and were very professional about making things right. We ended up at this location next time around as it was closer.   Great good and great happy hour.  Hostess and cocktail waitresses need to realize they are in gilbert, az...not New York City. Dressed a little silly if you ask me.

We had dinner here last week for my birthday. Sign up for their emails, and you get a $25 gift card for your birthday. It's a great deal!   BEST FILET MIGON THIS SIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI!   The twice baked potatoes will make you wanna jump out of your booth right into a praise break!   Even the wedge salad is blessed and holy! SHUNDA!!!   This evening was made even more special by the amazing service of Cody and the manager on duty. They were VERY professional and friendly. Went out of their way to make the night special.   We will be back before my big 30!

Nothing outstanding. We ordered grilled cheese, mini brats, steak, and a chicken sandwich.   Sandwich was cold and a little too charred.   Mini brats were good.   Steak was burnt   Grilled cheese was ok.   Server was nothing more than just a server, which is fine. I know she was busy.   Maybe will give it another shot, as we will be living across the street soon.

Great sports bar! Friendly and fast service. Chips and queso were BOMB! We got the ribs, and they were some of the best ribs we've had. They fell right off the bone. Chicken tenders were a little bland. Fries were good.   Soooo many TVs and they are happy to switch channels for you, and they do it promptly.

So...this is a hard review for me. I just had amazing Chinese food this past week....maybe New York is different?   I ordered delivery. He told me 45 mins, which I hoped was like pizza and really showed up in 20. Nope, 45 mins exact almost.   The food was packaged nicely, and was warm.   It was a little soggy...which I understand cause it is delivery....but you can get Panda, drive 45 mins, and it still is crispy.   I got the orange chicken, and the flavor was good. Some times I had that...."what am I eating" moment. Especially with the egg roll. I am not sure what that was. That was not fresh and or good.   When I started this review I was thinking I would give them another shot....but I rather just go to Panda. It would have saved me $5.   They were very nice over the phone!!

My wife and I had a very interesting experience here. All I will say is, really make sure you request the right person for what you need. I will not hold my first experience against them, as my wife had a great experience.   Now with that said, go see Sidney if you are like us and go for true therapy and knots getting rubbed out. She went beyond just a basic massage and really relieved pain for my wife.   I was scheduled to return, but had an emergency. I plan to return to Sidney as soon as I am able to!!

Nothing fancy.  Average price for strip mall massage   Lynn was AMAZING however. She did such a great job at getting my knots out. She was polite and did not try to up sell me on anything. Was very knowledgeable.   The front desk briefly mentioned their membership, but didn't push anything on me. Very polite.  It is a little silly to have a $20 increase after the first service, unless you enroll. You have a highly rated spa across the street only charging $55 flat rates. Just my 2 cents.

THIS REVIEW IS FOR LUKE DAYS ONLY 3/14  God bless America, and I love the military!!   However, they HAVE to figure something out when it comes to the air show. The traffic and crowd control was horrible. People were screaming, crying, and fighting. I expected a stampede....and this was just to get out! Getting in took 2 hrs. It was really really bad.

Went in and waited an hour....NOT ONE PERSON WAS CALLED BACK. At least 6 people in front of me. I rather wait at home for 4 hrs and call an ambulance if it gets worse. Will never come back here.

I was interested in the HCG injections and shots, so I thought I would call around and get some information. I was hesitant, as anytime you call places to ask for information, they just tell you that you have to come in for a consultation. Then I call Naturally Nurturing. From the first phone call, I was dead set on this place. The front desk lady (I am horrible at names) is so informative, kind, and just amazing. Every time I have had to speak with her has been just great. She deserves a raise, high five, hug, and fist bump.   Now...the Dr....SHE'S JUST AS COOL!! She was so knowledgeable about things that not even the "other doctors" know about. Most look at me confused when I mention the medications I take, and she knew exactly what they were. She is the real deal, and I am so happy I chose this doctor office to do the HCG program.   I am in week one, so I will updated this review in several weeks. I will be meeting with the Dr. weekly, and I can not wait!

One of my best car purchasing experiences. Ask for Greg next time you go in to look at a car. He worked out a great deal for us, which came in far better than other dealers (*cough*Carmax across the street) could offer us. He treated my wife with a lot of respect, and treated me the same. We really left happy and not feeling like they just took our arms and legs.

This place came under new management this past year. It use to be Alliance, and it is now MEB. Alliance was thee worst management company, and this place was turning into a cat infested dump. Here's comes MEB to the rescue! Ever since MEB took over things have improved. They have made many improvements throughout the property, and every interaction we have with management is pleasant. All staff have really been great to deal with.   The apartments themselves are very nice and upgraded. Looking for a house and our requirement is, must be nicer than our apartment. Believe it or not, that's been difficult.   Would recommend this complex to any of my friends and family.

This is not your typical gym or personal training gym. These people are the friendliest trainers and gym staff that I have ever met.

This place had a great atmosphere that makes you want to come back. I must say, our favorite person here is Paige, but they're all great! We are considering signing up for a longer period of time now that our trial is over.

My family has stayed at this hotel multiple times, and we always have issues. We generally will use Hotwire because we are guaranteed a hotel in our general area, and this hotel does not hold to the promise of providing a room that accommodates the number of guest put on the reservation. They count the couch as a "bed", then they try to charge you for an "upgrade" when you request 2 queen beds. They always seem to care less about your frustration. Leslie today did not care much at all and told me to contact Hotwire. None of the other hotels in the general area give us trouble like this one.

I should have known better walking into a dirty empty yogurt shop on a Friday night. Most the time these places are popping in Gilbert. All the machines were dirty, and he store had an odd smell. We went in tried some flavors, and all their flavors tasted sour. It was so bad that we had to walk out.

This theater and the Harkins at Chandler mall are the same distance from our home. We choose this one every time. It is nice, clean, and not full of young kids. Nothing against them, we have all been young once.   The refill cup deal not not be beat. The pizzas are surprisingly good. They bake them fresh when you order. They are the Freschetta brand.

Normal place was booked, so I turned to Yelp. Read a lot of good things about Ruth, and luckily she was available. She was the sweetest lady ever! Not only sweet, she knew how to give an amazing men's cut. I showed her some pictures my wife sent with me from Pintrest, and she showed me some pictures from Pintrest, and then we settled on a look. BEST HAIRCUT EVER! My wife approved and loved it. Ruth is my new hair lady.

I just got off the phone with Erin at your Williams Field location. I am not sure how you train your managers, but I would assume you do not train them to argue with your customers. We called in and ordered an extra large pizza, and they brought us a large. We refused the order and called to requests our proper order. When I called I spoke with a polite female who I explained my issue to, and she placed me on hold. After 5 mins Erin came to the phone and asked how he could help me. Frustrating to be passed on to someone else after I explained my issue. Erin then proceeded to explain to me that I ordered a large and asked me why I did not correct them when they read the order back to me. I was astonished, all I wanted was my extra large pizza, not for free, I wanted to pay for it. I just wanted the correct order. The conversation ended with him asking, "what can I do for you?", which I had already explained that I just wanted what I ordered. He then told me I could email Bruce Barro if I had an issue. We order pizza from Barros regularly, and we love your pizza. I have never had an issue, and your company always offers great service. I am shocked by how we were treated this evening, and it will be hard for me to order a pizza from Barros again.

I can not wait to return. Looking for info on how to become VIP. This will be a new spot for us.

Very good food.   They seem to have something for everyone.   They also have some interesting drinks, not just your common cocktails.   The decor is awesome, and the wall of cassette tapes is cool.   Do not forget to visit the ice cream parlor right next door (connected)  It is a little odd, the front door is in the back, and there is not really a hostess, you just kind of walk right into the commotion. They are generally super friendly and someone will greet you, and then someone will seat you.

Someone needs to teach these people bed side manners....maybe I just went on a bad day. Everyone was short, rude, and seemed like they were all sick themselves. We were the only ones there, and we waited over 15 mins once we were brought back to be seen. Does not help when you see a full staff sitting with their feet on the table reading and surfing the web.   Now, they diagnosed me and got me all fixed up, but I would not return to this urgent care.

This place is great. The food, atmosphere, and service. We have been multiple times now and tried burgers, pizza, and salads. We have not eaten anything that has not been outstanding. Every time we go the owner and his wife are there and come and visit every table. They have a very large selection of beer, which the owner went over in detail with my girlfriend. It is complimentary valet parking, walk up a small flight of stairs, and enter a dimly lit posh restaurant, but you do not pay the posh price. It's such a great place to wine and dine guest too!

It is not a good feeling when you bump into your base board with the vacuum and you find out that it has been completely hollowed out by termites. I am so glad that I called Enviro Control! The young lady who answered the phone was so courteous and helpful. She ensured me that someone would come out immediately to do an inspection, and give me my options for treatment. The very same day someone was out at my house. They performed a thorough inspection, and they were very knowledgeable when it came to the termites. I am happy to report that my home is termite free! It was such a great experience that I signed up for pest control, so now my home is pest free as well!   I would highly recommend these guys to any of my friends and family.

Do the groomers even like dogs?   I will never return here. They treated us like garbage and they did not even acknowledge our dogs. If you are not happy to see my dogs, then I am not going to leave them with you. The staff did not help as our hands were full with 2 dogs when they asked for information. Our dog pooped on the floor, and of course we apologized. Nothing.....not even a "its ok"....Did not even make eye contact with us or offer to help.   As you can imagine, we left and took our dogs elsewhere.

Oh Yelp, you VERY RARELY let me down. How you have misguided me! This place has 4 stars!?!? In Arizona!? Bless their hearts, they tried. Beans tasted fake, salty, and microwaved to molten hot pocket lava status. Tortilla was disgusting, and far from authentic. I don't understand these reviews. IS THIS REAL LIFE?!? I am Hispanic, so I am critical of Mexican food, but still, don't tease me Yelp!!

I've noticed a trend....groupon goers are cheap and only review to complain about places.   Nonetheless, I enjoyed the service and quality I received. Got flowers next store and picked up a couple cake pops for my wife. They were moist and flavorful. Extremely affordable too!

Brought friends from out of town.   Chips and salsa were great! Chips seemed to be homemade.   Burger was HUGE! My wife and I shared, it was AWESOME!   Parking can be nuts, and it's a small joint.

This place is so good, and the staff is super friendly.    The breakfast burritos are huge, and the salsa is yummy.   the tacos are huge too!   my family from Tucson loves it, and even ask for us to bring them food when we head down there

Disregard all other reviews. I mean, there hasn't been many since over 2 yrs.   This place is great, and the doctors are all amazing! They crack me like no ones business. I'm so cracked out by the time I leave, it's amazing. It's quick, easy, and relieving. I have been to multiple Joints all over the valley, and these doctors are the best. Not only can they squeeze every last crack out of all my bones, they are friendly and personable. They always rennet me and my wife. Btw...my wife is 8 months pregnant, and they know how to handle her properly.   The front desk girls are always friendly and nice.   Defiantly give it a shot. I'm not down with the games and procedures of regular chiropractors. Crack me out and let me fly!

So, I am cancelling my account with The Joint.   As you can see, I am a fan, but I can not stand companies who are not flexible and or understanding.   I froze my account while my wife and I were on maternity leave to save money. I needed a quick adjustment in that time, so I figured I could walk in and pay the $39 for a one time. Nope, they were not going to allow that. Instead I paid the $49 to unfreeze it, and I cancelled it at the same time.   Companies have to learn to be flexible, especially when it is really benefitting them. Instead of getting $0 from me when my account was frozen, they could have gotten $39 here and there while I was on leave.

Wow! So amazing. Fresh and flavorful sandwiches. Whatever this bread they use, it's out of this world.   My wife had number 11 and I had the number 35. We also got the garbanzo bean salad...now garbanzo beans are not something I would buy on a trip to sprouts....but this was SOOO good.   The owner (manager? Not sure) came by and made sure we enjoyed our food. She asked if we tried the kale salad and, of course we didn't. My wife knows I hate kale and kale fads...lol...well she made is try it, and I finally found kale I enjoy! It was flavorful and sweet. Very fresh.   We will be back as our church is right up the street.

Had a wonderful experience today with AZ Dukes. From scheduling to tech arrival, their communication was perfect.   The tech, Todd, was fantastic. He was personable, friendly, and extremely knowledgable. I truly appreciate his sincerity and honesty. I now am confident that we will not encounter any A/C surprises this summer. I have a warranty, but I trust AZ Dukes more than my warranties contractor. Especially after having Todd come to my home.   If you need A/C service, these guys should be your #1 choice.

First things first....AMAZING SERVICE. Team style....and right on! Everyone was so friendly and informative. My drink was constantly refilled, and that's big for me.   Now...food....AMAZING!!! Best margarita pizza I have ever had. It tastes so fresh.   The donuts were so good.   Great deal on Monday and Tuesday. $20 for pizza and bottle of wine or two pitchers of draft. If you don't finish the wine...they cork it and send it home with you!   Will be back for sure.

I just moved near this Lapels, and they have not lacked in service or quality. Always quick and easy. I have been going to a Lapels since I moved to the Valley, and I have always had great service, and they get the job done. I wish that their reward system was set up a little better. In tucson you got points for every dollar spent, not only when you spend $15 or more. That makes more sense. I can not always bring in large loads.

Possibly loosing my business. They charged me way too much to clean shorts, just cents less than cleaning pants. Then they charged me extra because 2 shirts had to be hand pressed....why not call me and ask me? The boys upfront were clueless, and one handed me a price list and walked away, which I found insulting. I don't mind paying for services, I've been with Lapels for a while now. Just kind of ridiculous to have a $40 dry clean bill for probably $25 worth of clothes. Will be looking around.

I'm officially done with this place. Their prices are ridiculous, and they keep finding excuses to charge me more without telling me. 2 long sleeved TSHIRTS and 1 plain TSHIRT cost me $14.90. Allegedly it is harder to press long sleeved shirts with buttons. Yet they do all my dress shirts for $2.50 that are lined all the way down with buttons. It is ridiculous, and they should warn customers of what they will be charged before they charge. Will be taking my business elsewhere.

As you can tell, I have he some issues with this place, and I have even swore them off. Sadly, they are to only dry cleaner in my area.   What kept me coming? JANET! The owner has a Jew in that young woman. She's always smiling and friendly. She always ask how I am and how my family is doing. She really saved me as a customers. I also do respect how the owner does reach out to anyone who has issues. He does care about his customers. I will continue to support this local business because of Janet.

Just too expensive. I saw a couple new dry cleaning shops pop up, and I just can't justify these prices anymore.   2 short sleeved button up shirts 2 shorts 1 pair of joggers   $26.   Ridiculous. That was just half my order too. Other half wasn't completed.

I dealt with Kenny on getting a quote to have flooring done. Had a terrible time just simply trying to get a quote from him. Was very unprofessional, and was difficult to get a hold of. Needless to say, I have another company coming out to install my flooring. Would not recommend these guys.

I wanted to give this place 5 stars. So....I will give it another try one day.   First, we walked in and we were greeted by no one. Literally....not one person said anything. Multiple people made eye contact. Finally an older women (thinking the owner) came out and sat us.   The waiter was very nice and helpful.   We enjoyed our soup, and my wife said the sushi was not the best she had ever had.   NOW....My food....I started eating my chicken and it seemed a little weird. I spit it out, and it was raw, all of it was still raw. I sent it back and waited for another 10 mins. At this point, everyone had finished eating. They brought it back out.....and it was still RAW!! At this point, I was done. They brought it out again and I just boxed it up.   The flavor and all was good. Just not the experience. Kind of crazy that they did not offer any compensation. I am not want to want free things, but raw chicken is kind of serious. The woman (owner/manager) was very nice, but not once did she apologize, or even acknowledge what happened.   Again, food tasted good. Sushi was ok. Will definitely give them another try....maybe...possibly

Walked in and greeted by a friendly, yet mellow, woman. She walked me into a small cooler and showed me what they had. It was a limited a selection, but the quality was top notch! She threw together a beautiful bouquet, and it was extremely affordable. I would definitely give them my business again. My wife LOVED the roses.

So far this is the best Chinese food I have had in Gilbert. The flavor was so savory and delicious. I had beef lo mein, and it was fantastic. Also had crab puffs, and they were great. Will defiantly be back!   Also...the owners and wait staff were top notch. Came and talk to us and made sure we enjoyed our experience.

TURN AND RUN  First...the staff is terrible and rude. They talk to you like you are 5.   Second- We ordered a rose gold band to match my wife's rose gold engagement ring. 3 months later, we discover that the band is actually sterling silver....STERLING SILVER!!!! They charged us $700 for a sterling silver ring that may have been dipped in rose gold. The receipt says ROSE GOLD CUSTOM BAND. I am appalled and have filed complaints with the FTC, BBB, and AZ Attorney Generals Office.   FM may be a great jeweler, as my Tucson store was awesome! The manager Diana is amazing. That ring I purchased in Tucson still looks amazing.

Corporate got involved, and they were very generous and apologetic. They are refunding us our money.   I do not believe this store reflects Fred Meyer as a whole. The Tucson location is great and they create excellent jewelry. At some point we will head down there to get a new wedding band made for my wife.

"I just want an honest mechanic." That is the phrase you most commonly hear people say when their car is giving them trouble. Well, you found him, and his name is Rich. He has made my car like new and was honest and fair. We will be driving down from Phoenix to bring our car to Rich, it is worth the drive. He will put all mechanics in Casa Grande out of business once word starts spreading of his great service.

As always, best Chinese restaurant in the valley. I have been to both locations, and it's always amazing! The crab won tons are out of this world, the pot stickers are amazing, and the fried rice will make you want to slap yo mama! The citrus chicken is very good as well.

Whisky Ranch BBQ catered our event today. They were excellent to work with! On time, friendly, and went above and beyond to make sure everything went smoothly. From set up to tear down, it was like watching an artist paint a masterpiece. They even offered to assist people with food allergies!   Now the food.....you have to have drank too much whisky to think anything negative about their food! I could not get enough of their beans!!! They were sent from heaven on a gold platter for me to devour! I was able to try their brisket, chicken, potatoes, green beans, and beans. It was all phenomenal!   I would not hesitate to book them for our next event!

I always avoided this place due to the reviews. Then one day I was extremely ill and could only have liquids. My wife picked me up a smoothie, and I was hooked! Their smoothies are delicious. Yes, they lack is customer service. Not rude, but young, timid, and no management. However, just get your damn smoothie and leave! It's a smoothie place, not Ruth's Chris.

Took the family from Tucson, and we are all very picky when it comes to Mexican food. It's hard when you're Mexican and come from a family of Mexican restaurant owners.   Red sauce=no bueno   Carne asada= bomb   Salsa= good  Beans= good  Rice=ok  Tortillas=bomb   Carnitas= eh...kinda dry  All in all, we will return. Staff was super friendly and on their game!

Because I have to give this place a star, I am dedicating it to the service center front desk and the cashier.   Allen Clark is the most dishonest service advisor I have ever dealt with. Not only is he dishonest, he is very lazy and takes his time. In 5 days he did not once answer his phone. You have to leave him a message for him to call you back, generally 2-3 hrs later. I would highly caution anybody before they choose this dealership for service. The service manager Greg lacked just as much customer service and care as Al did. I was shocked at how this place operates and serves (or lack of) their clients. I will never return to this crooked dealership for service again. If you have to, defiantly avoid Allen (Al) Clark.

OK....fair warning....I hate sea food. I walked in this place and the smell was awful...yet oddly alluring.   However, this place is so cool! We had some of the best service I have ever had, and the food was great. Granted, I did get chicken strips, but I tried it all. The alligator bites were surprisingly delicious...like really really good...try them...NOW! I tried various seafood bug meat...or crab/shrimp...whatever you call it...I call it bug meat....It was all very good though. Would defiantly bring someone here who loves Cajun type seafood.  Our waiter Noel did a phenomenal job with such a large group of guys. Better service than some 4 star restaurants we go to.

Going to a new restaurant and complaining about wait times is like going to Disneyland and complaining about the lines for the rides.   I went today around lunch time and there were 3 people in front of me. From stepping in to food on table, 10 mins max.   The sandwich was full of meat and full of flavor. BTW... you can get extra meat if you request it...it is in BIG BOLD LETTERS on the menu.   The pastries were awesome! This place is definitely better than Paradise.   It is new, and the staff is still getting in their groove. The service is not out of this world, but you are at a dang sandwich shop. I can not stand when I walk in a fast food place and everyone from behind the counters yells WELCOME!!!!   I digress

Took family from out of town today....and it was good....until we got to the bottom. The ice cream was sour...rotten? We all gaged and stupidly passed it around to confirm our suspicion.

Let me start with saying....The night staff on 1-8 was bomb.com. They were so nice and patient when we walked in at literally 5 mins to close. I could not appreciate that more. They accommodated our group of savage men who were out busting criminals all night....they helped save the city that night...  These donuts are fancy...and delicious. Salted carmel was so good. Again, these are fancy donuts, so you will pay $5 for 2 donuts, and upwards of $15 for a dozen. This is more of a specialty doughnut shop.

HOLY CRAPPY SERVICE!! Wow....so rude and unprofessional. I was reading all the other reviews and thinking....give me a break....but no, they are so rude. Only nice worker was the cash register.   Barely any chicken left, so they decided to scrape out the little extra dry pieces. I refused and waited for new chicken. Then made my burrito and it tore....but just kept going. I asked if that's how they make all their burritos, she said no. I asked for mine to be re-made....she didn't appreciate that. Slammed my burrito in the trash. Told her thank you,, and got an "you're an asshole" half smile.   Food- 4 stars. Loved the homemade tortilla and the chicken. Will come back and hopefully catch them at a better time.

After walking into an awkwardly empty restaurant, we were seated by a VERY sweet young girl. She was the best staff member in that place, and she was probably 16.   Sat for 10 mins and no one came and gave us a menu or took our drink order. One waitress kept walking back and forth, and another was eating and applying her lipstick. Mind you, there are 4 other people in this place. At this point, I'm done and we are just going to leave. As we are packing our baby up to just leave, they bring the menus. We let them know we are actually leaving, and with a smile one of the waitresses says as we walk out the door, "have a nice day!" At least their early exit service is friendly. . .   Again, the young hostess was sweet and gave us the best service out of anyone in there.

Great place...HUGE menu....maybe read it online before you stroll in...or you will stand there like it's 1995 and you are trying to figure out what movie to rent from Blockbuster.   All our sandwiches were great. Fries were good, nothing special to me.   Got really busy towards lunch time, very limited seating. Not a bad thing though! Place is booming.

Not only do we love this place, our puppies love this place. They are always so friendly, and they do such an amazing job! We have been through many groomers who claim to have to shave our pups due to matting, but I just call it laziness. They never shave our pups bare here. They always come home smelling AMAZING and with little cute scarfs or ties....literally little doggie neck ties. I also love that they do not crate them, and they keep them together.   DON'T FORGET THE BLUEBERRY FACIAL!!

Some would say that I just got a simple haircut by a barber, but I say that I got a masterpiece by an artist! Erick is truly an amazing barber. You can tell he has put hard work into his craft, and he loves doing it. After having my hair botched at a salon and wearing hats all the time, Erick made me excited again about doing my hair. Not only do I love it, the wife loves it! This was my first time here, and I will now be a regular.

Probably best breakfast burrito place in Gilbert. Everything tastes fresh, and the bacon wasn't chewy! Also had a side of beans, and they were tasty. Definitely will be back for the breakfast burritos.   The place was clean, soda was good (I feel like most of Mexican fast food have nasty soda), and the staff was very friendly.

Don't come here for great service. Come here to eat the most unhealthy delicious fattening meal you will eat all year! They have THE BEST fried chicken and waffles. Better than Roscoes in LA. If you are craving this combo, this is the place to come to. Also, if you are questioning this combo, you have to just try it to understand its amazingness.

This was a fantastic hotel. From check in to check out, we had 0 issues. The rooms are nice and new, and the beds are awesome. They accommodated us with all our request, and even brought a microwave late at night for my niece to warm up here butter noodles. Definitely a great pick if you are in this area.   Not a far drive from San Tan Village area where we live.

Who doesn't love some good ole froyo!? This place always hits the right spot. They always have solid flavors, and it is always clean. Staff is always on point as well. Sign up for the point system, you get $5 after you hit 50 points, which isn't that hard if you're a fatty like me. Also, 50% off if you go in your pajamas on Wed nights. Come on....froyo AND pajamas...that's living!

It was all very good.  The theater is amazing!! And the prices!?! How are they so good. The seats are amazing.

Came back to take my in law to a movie. Was a good experience, and everyone was friendly and helpful. Just a couple issues that knocked down my star rating.   1. Checked in and got a check in offer of a free large popcorn. Shawn Finch (MOD) gave us a FIRM FYI that we must print out the coupon next time. Um....ITS A CHECK IN OFFER!! I have to check in and be at your business before I can even redeem the offer. Am I suppose to go home and print it out and then come back? Don't offer a check in offer if you do not understand how it works. He allowed it "this one time."   2. Hard to find seat numbers when Theater is dark. Our whole row was shifted down too far because people were confused. Row letters are lit, but seat numbers are not. Yes...I am the dummy for showing up late.   3. Sound was lacking. Kind of sounds like a good home theater system, not a cinema.   Lastly....I still prefer Harkins. I know...I know...how could I not love the comfy recliners. It's just, Fat Cats is great, but it's does not give me that cinematic adventure I am seeking after. It just does not feel like a theater in a weird way.   Overall, still a great place!

The staff was delightful and extremely helpful. They met every need and request.   I would recommend this place for any type of event you are planning.

I loved this place. The drinks are so creative and tasty, and the service was great! This is a place we will frequent when in the mood for a tasty unique drink.

This place has some great breakfast and lunch. The service is great, and there is never a long wait.   This last time was a little bit of a bummer, because we found hair in both of our dishes :(   I mean...we all have eaten a little bit of hair :) I have a feeling someone was not following the rules that day.   It is worth giving it a shot! A little hair never killed anyone.

BoSa donuts are simply the best. I've never had a bad donut from this place. The crumb donut is bomb.com.

I signed up here before it opened for a rewards card, and man I love that thing! Free drink every day for 30 days! They have great tea, and this morning I had a breakfast sandwich that made my heart and soul happy. Give it a shot! Similar (maybe even same company) to Paradise, but food seemed better to me.

HOLY BRATWURST!!   I found this place at the Gilbert Farmers market. We bought a packet of their beer brats, and they are AMAZING!!! I literally put down my brat to come and type this review. So moist and flavorful!

Very cool style and decor.....but this place is depressing and the food is depressing. From the music to the staff, they all need an attitude adjustment. We ordered the banana pancakes, and they were absolutely terrible. They tasted like mushy oatmeal. The other orders at our table did not look appetizing. The salad looked wilted and the bread from the sandwich was stale. To add to it, there was a fly all around our table and on our food. My wife gave up on her food. Will not return.
