Rob L. nailed it, this was a surprising gem.   I wanted something close to the Jackson Barrett Auto Auction, this worked perfectly. Even better they had a shuttle bus to/from the event so we could over indulge in cocktails without any care!   Looking around the place I don't think any room would have a bad view. Our room overlooked the desert, hearing the coyotes cry at night was spooky!...but very cool. I won't bore you with the details but it's a very attractive place. What finally nailed it for me was the down pillows and sheets, one of the best night's sleeps I've had in ages. Whoever designed the room really thought of everything down to the toilet seat that doesn't slam down!    The service was mostly good. I called and asked if we could check in early and they said the room would be ready in an hour...awesome! The concierge and front desk staff always had a smile and were helpful. The valet and drivers were VERY cool and fun. The maid was sweet with a big smile. However, the woman bartender (with a Jamaican accent?) was terrible.  No worries.   Next time I'm in the area I'll be staying here again. Good Job!

It's a combination car show, car auction, circus and food frenzy! We had an awesome time, the atmosphere is electric. If you're a car enthusiast this should be a destination. I saw some really good cars go for very reasonable prices.  My only suggestion is to have more porta potties in the section where the higher end cars are exhibited. It's easy to buy beer but harder to get rid of it!..lol.  Good Job!

Four floors dedicated to chocolate ecstasy! Anything M&M you ever wanted is here. I won't bore you with the details; bought some goodies for my niece and the best part is they shipped it for me! A definite stop if your in Vegas & have kiddos in your life.

We just went to see the Stratosphere...sadly to say this place seen better days. The view is awesome and that's where it ends. On a Saturday afternoon, no lines & no bustling crowds quite different scene from the other end of the strip.  I could never imagine staying here for a night the neighborhood looks a bit sketchy...

Classy place...  It's located in the center of the action so you don't have to walk far. The Miracle Mile Shops & Cabo Wabo Cantina are directly across the street. The Michael Mina restaurant was delicious. The foyer was done in a stunning oriental theme. Room service was prompt and very friendly. The club Hyde overlooks the fountain and at night offers a spectacular view. The room was immaculately clean. I hate cigarette smoke and I barely noticed it in the casino. Check in and out was a breeze. I personally don't think it's priced too badly for what you get. Three night stay with room service (coffee only) came out to $401 per day.   Downfalls: Not having coffee in your room means you have to order room service, I expect this is by design. Higher end hotels mostly have a Resort Fee. No matter where I stay it still bugs me, for this charge you get ? They say it's for using the amenities, like the pool, which they promptly tell you to leave at 4:00PM. Otherwise a great experince.   Good job Bellagio!

Eight of us stumbled in dry, parched and sorely in need of alcoholic refreshment!  The waitress was cool, fun and efficient. The restaurant overlooks the strip so you can laugh at the mayhem while you chow down. The food is what you would expect from a country western theme. I was all 'burgered out' and opted for the Gilly's salad what actually was delicious! My dining cohorts enjoyed their dishes, they all agreed the only weak part of their meal was the french fries. No worries..  Good job Gillys!

What's good about this mall there's something for everyone. Places to eat, attached to Planet Hollywood and places you'll find at any other mall in America (meaning affordable) as well as some upscale places.   One reviewer mentioned the aggressiveness of some of the kiosk vendors and she is absolutely correct. More than one had something wise to say when I politely told them I was not interested. I was on vacation so I didn't tell them to go screw themselves which I'm always inclined to do!

Service here is rock star, thanks Sammy!  After taking our lives in our hands by crossing the "race track" they call the strip, eight of us bumbled in around 9AM (we were across the street at the Bellagio). Just like true Las Vegas tourists we began our day with Bloody Mary's, Mimosa's, French toast and Jimmy Buffet on the speakers.   Is it a tourist trap? Sure, but if I have to be trapped somewhere this works. The food is hot, the girls are eye candy and the booze concoctions are inventive. The outside bar overlooks the strip and people watching is an absolute trip. Watching the bums harass the overworked hookers and the hookers flashing the "Jesus Saves" advocates is priceless!   Oh, the food, it's not fine dining, if you're expecting that you'll be sorely disappointed. If you're looking for decent vittles priced as expected you'll be fine.  Burritos and burgers....What else what would you expect? They actually have a good breakfast selection too.   We're really easy to please/fun travelers- very respectful to the people who bust their ass for us. The staff was amazing - really some of the best service I received on my trip - they should be proud of that.

Went downtown, haven't been to Fremont Street in years. It was so crowded it wasn't fun. Trying to grab a bite proved impossible but one in our party spotted this little gem right off the beaten path.   Our party of 13 were seated within 10 minutes, our waitress was great. The menu has much more than pizza. Both the pizza and meatballs were delish! The pies run from the standard pepperoni to their QUATTRO CARNE.   Nice to see a place that really cares about putting out a great product with awesome service!

The service was so crappy at Four Peaks we left, walked around the corner and found this place! The service was like night and day. The bartender here was awesome, he even took a few minutes to teach us old farts how to use Uber. I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious. It's hard to screw up a burger but you'd be surprised how many places make a lousy one.  Yeah, next time I'm in town, I'll be back.
