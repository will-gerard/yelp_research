Perfect place for a special night out  with your favorite person.   My BF and I had our first date here- it has a cozy, mom and pop shop type of feel and the service was great. The servers were helpful with their recommendations. We have been here several times and each time we order something different.   So far my favorite thing on the menu is Ropa Vieja - juicy beef in a tomato based sauce. **Mouth watering**  Any time I have visitors, I take them to this spot. If you like good Cuban food or want a pleasant and warm place for dinner and good conversation. This is it.. Happy Eating

Quick and friendly service! All Starbucks are not the same! The baristas here are wonderful. I enjoy starting my morning here and studying here at night.

It's Margarita Time!   Their margaritas are legit (can I still use that word?). I usually have their Carne Asada Burritos they're pretty big. I usually fill up on their chips and salsa and take my half burrito home for late night snack. It's a good place for groups or happy hour.

Fresh, Light, delicious meals at a decent price  I have been here for several events - b-day parties, Sunday brunch, girls night, date night, etc.. and it fits any occasion. During the day, it's nice to get some AZ sun on their patio. At night, the candles and ambiance is inviting. Also, their service is FANTASTIC, they are truly concerned with making your experience a good one.   Happy Eating!

This place is so good, that I got sick after eating here once and still wasn't turned off!  ( In all fairness it may have been caused by eating too much)   The line always looks long, but waiting time is very short.  The menu isn't huge, but they make what the got WELL   I love the picnic style outdoor seating   It's a great family place for kids.   Happy Eating!

Every time I come here this place is so busy but the Baristas always have a smile I can appreciate good customer service. Parking is kind of a bummer because of all the people driving in to the gas station and the other nearby stores.

Horrible customer service  Don't you hate when someone is quick to take your money but slow and rude when delivering their product/service?   If I pay for a dress in full the day I order it, I don't think it's too much to ask that it be delivered on time. Am I crazy? I also do not expect to be yelled at or ignored ...  I've worked in the retail business and from my experience places like this don't stay around long.     Brides- save yourself the headache and find a competent wedding retailer.

French Toast Bagel- duex s'il vous plait !  The bagels here are huge compared to other bagel places. They are crunchy on the outside soft warm and delicious on the inside (if you toast them). My favorite is the French toast, but they are all pretty great. They have a variety of cream cheese favors to choose from. I prefer peanut butter on my bagels! The OJ is fresh but a bit pricey. If you can purchase day old bagels, you can get a good deal for a dozen.

Great Vegan Cupcakes and Rich Delicious Coffee  What makes this  place great? the ambiance  The coffee shop provides customers with a peaceful, easy going vibe. It is the perfect place to study or meet with a friend. Outside their is a community garden, which is a great place for a stroll   Highly recommend this place for a Lunch/Breakfast or just a quick coffee fix.

Phoenix's Best Hidden Secret   Drinks: The Caipirinha's  here are delicious!(Caipirinha is a mojito like brazilian cocktail) They  have an array of imported rums and rum flight choices.  Food: I had the Ox tail and it was superb, a bit spicy but definitely something I would order again.  Service: Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the drink selection and history behind the rums.  Ambiance: Low lighting, romantic  I drove by this place dozens of times and had no idea what I was missing. A friend of mine recommended this place for happy hour. I have been back twice since and am a big fan.

Small cozy place, decent lunch specials!  This place is ranked #2 in best thai places in the east valley (unofficial poll). They offer great service and are quick - when ur in a rush. I wouldn't say the food is authentic but  it's delicious. I like it because it's a family business and the family is really sweet.

This is as good as it gets when it comes to Filipino Food in Phoenix  Phoenix sadly lacks the ability to produce comfort food such as Filipino food. Finding this place was like finding a gem in a pile of coal. The location isn't ideal but the price and the taste are on point.   This place randomly has events, karaoke &  dancing, so don't be surprised if you stop by to pick up some grub and find yourself watching a transgender performer singing the latest and greatest hits.

Coffee and service are superb !   The pastry selection is small but delicious. The place is small but there is outside seating. I love the cozy feel of this place. The servers are friendly and make a great cup of joe.

Buffet is excellent!   I don't like buffets because I feel like quality is sacrificed for quantity. However, this place is great! The food is decent and the ambience is unlike most casino buffets. The outside patio seating is recommended.

Low stars based on service and food (wine selection and ambiance are not bad)   If you want to go here on date, this is a great spot- it's romantic with the dark lighting and intimate seating.   If you want to take a group, maybe try another place- It seems very difficult for them to bring out food for large groups in a timely manner. Also, splitting the check must be rocket science because on various occasions they were not able to.

Get there really early or shoot for a late lunch to avoid the lines!   This place is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Mesa. They have a variety of healthy And delicious choices. The staff is always friendly and the service is prompt. I recommend the power house if your a meat lover like myself! If your on the other side of the spectrum try the vegan soup (us meat lovers think it's delish). If you get there between 9-11am you can expect a 15-30 min wait. They have self serve coffee outside for those who are waiting or u can run over to starbucks and grab some coffee/tea. Happy Mornings start with Eggs!

Great place for happy hour, group events and/or date night!   I normally get the house margarita and appetizers for happy hour- I recommend the tamales or the calamari. The tequila flights are a must for group events. The tacos are good but not very filling. Overall it's a nice new add to Dana park!

Availability is Key!    I locked my family out of our house late Sunday. It was raining and cold but that didn't affect the service at Sparks. They came to our rescue in a timely manner. The price was also reasonable in comparison to other companies I called. It took less than 5 minutes to get the door unlocked.

Great place to beat the summer heat! I love this location! Staff is always friendly and lots of seating. They always have a dairy free option, that changes regularly. I enjoy trying the new flavors and toppings!

Love the cupcake selection! Great place to by someone you love a sweet treat.   The cupcakes are anything but average- tres leches, salted pretzel something , cookie dough, lemon and so on. They have such a beautiful assortment of flavors. The artistic work of this cupcakes deserves 5 stars! However I am more about cake then the frosting so I had to give them 4 stars. Their cake bites are a bit too sweet for me. Also I wish they had more vegan options.
