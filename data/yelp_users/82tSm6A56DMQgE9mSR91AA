I rarely give 5 star reviews out, but Uncle Sams deserves it. I always order the half cheese steak with onions, and a side of mayo, ranch and sweet peppers. For a side I usually get either the fries, onion rings, mushrooms, or zuccini. But the fries satisfy me the most. Uncle Sams has the best cheese steak ive had, even better than all the places ive been too on the east coast and in philly.

Ive been going to Hodori since theyve opened. They use to be amazing at the beginning, but then after it changed owners, it started to go down hill. It was getting progressively worse for awhile, but lately things have changed. Foods been tastier, service is good, and they are always busy. I usually always only get the Beef and Mushroom tofu stew. It usually hits the spot!

I think this is my first 1 star review. I usually wouldnt leave 1 star, but this visit was the worst Ive ever had.  Ive been to this yard house a bunch of times in the past few years as well as many other yard houses in the southwest. Ive never been so dissapointed before. I usually get the bernaise sliders but this time i wanted to try something new. I tried the monte cristo but it wasnt good at all here. im surprised its even on the menu. We got a few other things and it was just okay.  Service wasnt the greatest, it was very slow, but the real reason this place gets a 1 star is because of the manager. I was meeting a few friends there. 1 of them was there when i arrived and we got the table, the other came in a bit and we all ordered. The last person was just coming to meet up and she arrived either close to closing time or maybe a little bit after closing. But we were still eating. She wasnt going to eat or anything, just meet up with us and hang out till we were done. My friend went to get her and the manager came up to us and said something like, you cant do that, we're closed. We told him that she wasnt ordering anything and that she was just meeting with us until we were done eating. He said a few other words and while im eating this horrible monte cristo im thinking, are you serious right now?? Shes not ordering anything, we are all together, we are gonna finish up eating and then we are all leaving together. Does he expect her to just sit outside and wait for us?? I would NEVER expect this at all from any restaurant and the worst is that it came from a manager. Yard House should send this guy to a customer service class. Not sure if i'll return but hopefully that manager learns how to not piss off his customers.

Stopped by with 2 friends to eat and catch up. Ordered so much food that our table was full. Everything was great as always. Medium golden wings, onion rings, and fries are my favs but you probably wont be disappointed with anything on the menu.

Have been extremely interested in trying out the new pretzel burger ever since my buddy told me about Wendys experimenting with the prezel bun.  While hanging out with my buddy that told me about it, we decided to give it a try. We finally arrived and there was no info on that burger. We asked the cashier and she said that it launched today but they dont have anything about it in store, but if you go thru the drive thru its on the menu. We went ahead and ordered it. We got the meals, upsized to large.  Total bill was about $22 for the combo's large sized. Extremely over priced especially being at a fast food resturant. Was hoping it was going to be delicious, but it was just okay. I would definitley never get it again unless they changed it up. The bun wasnt soft and chewy as it should be. It should have been way more delicious.  Wendy's, you gotta step it up.......

Ive been to Carolinas many times in the past decade. I use to always stop by and pick up a dozen tortillas because they are hands down the best tortilla that ive had. Other than tortillas, i usually get their tamales. However the last time I was in AZ, i stopped by and decided to try something new. I gave the green chili burrito a chance and i was hooked. I had to go back again the next day for some more goodness. They are kind of small so i decided to try a red chili burrito too. The red was good, but the green was the best. I left full, happy, and satisfied. Cant wait till im back in AZ again for some good mexican food!

Was grabbin a bite to eat with a buddy of mine and he recommended this place. I didnt have high hopes cause he kinda sucks when it comes to food. We were able to get a seat right when we arrived. They dont really clean up well since there was maple syrup all over my side of the table. They were busy and i was hungry. I looked around to see what everyone else was eating, and everything looked damn good. While i was trying to make a choice of what i wanted, one of the people at the table next to me got a mexican dish with chips and sauce all over it with eggs on top. It looked awesome and I had to get it. I also tried their Over easy coffee i think its called. It wasnt that great at all, nothing special in my mind. I got my mexican breakfast and it exceeded my expectations.  Service was good, food was great, i cant wait to go back and try everything else on their menu.

Was meeting a few friends and wanted to sit down and grab a bite. One of my buddies recommended this place and it was all of our first times there. Everything we all had was great, especially the monte cristo. Id come back.

Nicole L. . . . . . . . . Where do i even begin??????  So the only reason I went to Longhorns was because of your amazing review. It was my best friends birthday so i thought, might as well take him to an amazing, perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, quality steak dinner.  Pretty easy to find as its right on Alma School, which is literally right down the street from my place in Dobson Ranch. Parking lot was pretty empty so it was a good sign that there was no wait and we would be able to get attentive service, or it was a bad sign of things to come. However, I like to stay positive.  We walk in and there isnt a hostess to be found. Its pretty dead, maybe 3 - 4 tables occupied that was scattered thru out the resturant. While waiting to get seated, i'm getting my hopes up because of your review and how legendary im hoping this meal will be. You gotta understand that this was my first real steak resturant that i have been to after my 4 month journey in Southeast Asia where they usually dont eat steak. So again, we were only there based on your hyped up 5 star yelp review. After a few min, we get seated by an actual server rather than a hostess.  There were 3 of us, we were all very extremely nopah. Since we were there for steaks and for a birthday celebration, the decision was made for the biggest rib eyes for everyone. So we all went with the Outlaw Ribeye, Medium for the lady and Medium Rare for the men. (From their menu: Outlaw Ribeye - We called it this because it would be a crime if you didn't try it! It is one of our favorites because of the combination of juicy marbling and fire-grilled, bone-in flavor. 18 oz. $22.49)  After ordering, we get the infamous Longhorn bread. I am a huge bread and butter fan and can destroy a few loaves all to myself. However the bread was hard and seemed stale so we barely touched it.  We finally received our entrees and were ready to eat. Having perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, quality steaks in mind, this was a huge disappointment. Mine was cooked to medium, my GF was cooked to medium well, and the birthday boys was cooked to medium rare. The medium rare steak was juicy but not tender, the medium steak wasnt juicy or tender, but the medium well steak wasnt so juicy but it was tender.  All in all it was a huge disappointment. Service wasnt the greatest, but it was pretty average. Food quality was below average. Value isnt there. Total bill after tip and tax was about $92. We would have been better off going to Texas Roadhouse on Stapley.  Maybe i just came on an off night, but corporate places like this should have a level of consistency, but to me it was just a waste of $92.

I drove by this place many times and it never really stands out. One night i was on yelp and came across this place. Decided to start reading and research this place. It sounded interesting so i wanted to give it a try. A buddy of mine wanted to grab dinner so i said lets try the salty sow. the ambiance was different, but in a good way. Sat at the bar and ordered a drink. I forgot what it was, but it wasn't too bad. Unfortunately i wasn't too hungry so i just ordered the mini lamb burger off of the happy hour menu and i also wanted to try the duck fat fries that everyone talks about. Lamb burger was pretty delicious but the duck fries werent that great. My buddy got the tacos and he that they were delicious. Hes a hard very person to please, but he was impressed as was I.  I went back again a few days later with a different buddy of mine whos in the resturant business. He ordered the tacos too and he was impressed. I had the fried chicken and it was delicious! The touch of rosemary was refreshing in the chicken.  Im surprised that a restaurant like this is in this area. I would expect it to be somewhere closer to old town, they def dont get the recognition that they deserve. Everyone ive asked that lives in AZ hasnt heard about it, the Salty Sow should do some more advertising. This place really is a a real gem and i hope they stay for a very long time.

Verde Bloody Mary and the Havana Benny is my perfect breakfast. If you want to try two different Benny's, you can split an order of two Bennys. The pancakes are great, especially the cinnamon bun pancake. A few other good ones were the Samoa (like the girl scout cookie) and the pineapple upside down pancake.   Service is extremely friendly and great, but its EXTREMELY SLOW. Everytime I've gone we always get bloody mary's and mimosa's and it takes FOREVER. Then the food takes even longer to get, but you know what?? Its worth the wait. Expect to be waiting for a table too, each time I've gone its been about 45 min.
