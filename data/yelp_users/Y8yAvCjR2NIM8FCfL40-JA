The bagels were average and for what you get REALLY overt priced. I'm not impressed and probably won't go back.

The WORST dry cleaners I have EVER been to!!!! They DESTROYED my wedding dress!! I can never get that back. I asked the girl there repeatedly if they had dealt with wedding gowns before, she assured me everything would be fine as they had cleaned wedding gowns before and they would take care of my special garment, I get it back and they said they could not clean it, but that they tried and through their attempts at cleaning my dress they stained my white floral details pink, they left their own rust stains or something along the bottom of the dress, they put a safety pin right through the garment leaving a hole and they destroyed all the clasps at the back so my dress no longer closes, I can't even store it correctly because of these people. I cannot believe how much destruction they can do in just one day. Then when I went to pick up my dry cleaning the next day they couldn't find all of it and made me late for an appointment waiting for them to try locate my duvet cover which I landed up leaving without as I just couldn't wait anymore, when I went to pick it up the next day there were rust stains ALL OVER IT!! So they kept it and cleaned it yet again, and when I went in to get it after their second attempt at cleaning it it still had stains all over it, so now I have to take it somewhere else. I will NEVER EVER use this place again and I don't recommend that you take anything you care about here to be cleaned because this is the most destructive laundromat I have ever come across. Seriously, DO NOT TAKE YOUR CLOTHING TO THEM!!!! I would give them negative stars if I could.

Dr. Khayami is by far the BEST chiropractor I have ever seen! He is so kind, PROFESSIONAL, understanding and amazing. He really makes you feel like he CARES about you and I have had the privilege of being a patient of his for a while now and it just keeps getting better! He is an HONEST man and he treats the cause of the problem not just the symptoms and he will always customize his treatments for you depending on what is happening that day. I wish there was an option to give him 10 stars because he truly deserves it. I would highly recommend Dr. A to anyone looking for an AMAZING and affordable chiropractor!!

Firstly, they do not allow their special as a take out, so as a working woman who does not have time to sit at a restaurant for lunch, I don't get to enjoy the specials? Maybe I don't get out much but that was definitely a first. So I place an order for delivery and what arrived was not what I ordered,  despite the fact that the delivery guy checked and assured me the order was correct. I asked for a wheat bun and did not get one, they say their burgers come with lettuce, pickles, onions, tomatoes, and a sauce, my "burger" was a wet bun, a pattie and some cheese (mainly stuck to the foil and paper wrapper. Then to top it all off, the fries were stale, like leftover reheated fries and were not edible in my opinion. This was my first and will be my LAST meal at Burger Rush, what you get is definitely NOT worth what you pay for!! TERRIBLE!!

Won't deliver 1.4 miles away... Are you kidding me? They messed up my order and then wouldn't deliver the correct sandwich 1.4 miles away! Not impressed at all!! This is the only location that I have ever had this experience with, but really??
