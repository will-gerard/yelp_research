My yuppie ass LOVES this place. For so many reasons. I love feeling part of the trendy, hip clientele that frequent this place. I also love that there are oodles of hot businessmen working away on their laptops during the week, as well as hot athletes dropping by in the middle of a workout.   It can get insanely crowded, and parking sucks unless you're there at 9-10am before you're forced to valet. But, it adds to the feel sometimes.  Now for the food. If you must cheat on your diet, there is nothing better to use the meal on than a baked good from Tammie Coe. Anything in the muffin case is absolutely to LIVE for. My favorites are the blackberry bran muffin, banana muffin, and the salted chocolate chip cookie. Lord God I eat an entire one in a single sitting (they are huge). I don't eat typical breakfast fare, so I go straight to the Sonoma Garden Salad with dates and marcona almonds. OMG heaven. And that wild rice salad they have in the deli case is amazeballs if you're a whole grain snob. Sadly, LGO has little made with whole wheat, it's all white flour death.   Any coffee drink is bomb sauce. The only thing LGO could do to improve would be to add more vegetarian/vegan items. But those cookies.... godDAYUM.

LGO has just gone down a million notches for me. I am so sorely disappointed to find out they no longer carry Tammie Coe baked goods, which were the main reason I chose to visit in the mornings for a muffin or after dinner for a delicious sweet ending.   When I asked the front cashier about it, she said they wanted to take on the baking responsibilities themselves, which I understood, so I gave them a chance. The Princess Cupcake was *so* god awful flavorless with a horrible texture that I ended up giving it away. Seriously, who makes an awful cupcake?!   I also tried a new muffin- slice of heaven-which was good, and an oatmeal raisin vegan cookie, and the butterscotch oatmeal cookie. The butterscotch one was good, but all else fell short of expectations. I am sad to say, I think I need to find a new favorite place.   Very disappointing.

Great place! They have special knowledge with English bulldogs which is an added bonus!

OMG, please do yourself a favor and don't take the chance of ruining your hair! I suppose if you are lucky you might get a decent haircut but I was not one of them.  The student that cut my hair must have been pretty new in training because I asked for a basic haircut with a touch up on my layers and it turned out AWFUL. Not only were the layers not done at all, but the blow dry job was terrible. Frizzy, done with the wrong brush with no product for volume and shine. I could have done a better job myself.   I attempted to tell both she and her instructor and it was no use. Neither seemed to understand what I was asking for even though I asked for something SO basic. Now I have to spend more money fixing this POS mess. NEVER AGAIN.

Let me start by saying this place is REALLY hard to find! Even with my trusty GPS I found myself walking in circles and calling, calling,calling.   I've seen many complaints about service on here, and while my service was not BAD in terms of inattentiveness, it certainly wasn't normal. The waiter and manager both came over several times while we were eating and at one point I just wanted to say, "Um, can we eat? Please? It's great...I assure you. Skidaddle."  We had the Wildberry Pancakes with a side of fruit. Everything was good but for what we got, I consider the price steep. $12.50 for 2 pancakes?? Yes, they were good, but why not 3 with a little more topping? My $4 side of fruit was 3 orange slices and maybe 1/4 cup of apples. Lame. It's good but I'm not sure if I would return, at least on a day when I was really hungry.

This place certainly delivers on the ambiance factor, but....$14 for a salad? REALLY? And $9 for a plate of kale? REALLY? I think this place needs to get over themselves on the food pricing.  Mind you....that Kale Salad was one of the best kale salads to ever have hit my tongue. And I have eaten many kale salads in my life thus far.  The fries that came with my mother's burger were-interesting. The first taste that hit my tongue was sugar. After many more bites and confirmation from others at the table it is true....they put a lot of sugar in the seasoning used on the french fries (which were horribly limp and soggy!!). I won't use my discretionary calories on those again.   The service prior to being seated was fair at best. We sat at the bar for 5-10 minutes before the overly busy bartenders made their way over to us. Frequent checking was non existent. If you get a chance sit on the patio if the weather is nice. It's lovely!

OK, so I think I'm going to say I like this place even more than I did before. All because it is clear you have to be adventurous and try different things on the menu before you really make a judgment.   On my second visit, I moved away from my standard salad order and got the vegetarian taco plate. OH MY GOD. This was one of the best vegetarian platter dishes I have ever eaten in my life. Full to the brim with things that are not necessarily "taco platter" fare but oh SO delicious in their own right. It had: pico de gallo, guacamole, baked spaghetti squash, multi-colored carrots, sauteed oyster mushrooms, anda kale/quinoa salad that melted in my mouth. The corn tortillas it came with were so perfectly charred. It was all so ubelievably wonderful.   My date ordered the Hong Kong fish and really enjoyed it as well. The service was a little spotty but overall I must say I will certainly return. Such a classy place, too.

Unfortunately every "good" restaurant has their bad days too, and my last visit to Chelsea's was wretched. From start to finish.   My date put our name in and we were told 20-25 mins. Well ONE HOUR later after we continually asked we were finally seated (should have just walked out). I brought my date there for his first time and this was already not a good start.   We were seated and I ordered my usual vegetarian taco platter. The waitresses' description of it sounded so good this time around. However, when it arrived there was only ONE vegetable dish on it next to the taco fixings of salsa and guacamole! Half of the plate was empty! On other visits its been overflowing with so much goodness. MAJOR disappointment.   After that I just wanted to get out of there, so we did not stay to get dessert or linger. Not a good first impression for someone at all : /

What a disappointment. Came here because we had a Groupon and both dishes were horribly disappointing.   My french toast tasted like it had been soaked in pure eggs for days. Soggy, not flavorful at all (despite the advertised cinnamon bread they said they used). My boyfriend's eggs benedict was passable, but the hash browns tasted like they had been frozen. The service also was not very good. It took an awfully long time and as soon as a line of 4 people deep formed, existing customer's needs were ignored.  We are not returning to use the other Groupon's he bought for this place.

I love Pita Jungle just as much as the next person, but I have experienced seriously inconsistencies between all 4 locations I've frequented. Sometimes the food (esp the hummus) is SO incredibly salty that I can't even taste the hummus for what it is..... It is awfully Americanized, but there are so many other wonderful things on the menu to choose from.  The Fetoosh Salad is really quite good but it will feed you for 3 days (no kidding). My absolute favorite is the Mediterranean Salad with tabouli, raisins, pine nuts, and sauteed tofu. The Vegetarian sample platter is also a great way to get many good things.  The service is really, really, really weird. If you order an appetizer, 9 times out of 10 it will come WITH the entrees. Not in any good enough amount of time to work on it before much else. Some of the servers come back to the table a million times to ask how you are doing when you would like to be left alone to stuff your piehole. On that note, there are SO many airheaded, clueless hipsters working at these places that the service really, really, really suffers.   Otherwise, enjoy your Americanized Middle eastern food. It's damn tasty.

There are so many good things for me to say about this place that I have no idea where to begin.  The ambiance is so amazing no matter what time of day you go. The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!) is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date. The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items). It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items. One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan. As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what "vegan" meant. We ended up having to call a manager over.  The cocktail menu is so interesting it's hard to decide what to get. My favorite is the Dark and Stormy, which has ginger beer. *the BEST* cocktail around IMO. Do not pass up dessert. The bananas foster is amazing! Not traditional but good in and of its own.

Be sure to come here if you want your upper lip burned during a wax. Horrible experience will not ever be back.

Seriously, I have never enjoyed the pure, unadulterated taste of true coffee as I have at Cartel. My cappuccino was enjoyed sans sugar, flavoring, artificial sweetener.... everything. And it was so, so delightful. But it did not last nearly long enough :(  The place is so quaint and has a mom-and-pop, college atmosphere Starbucks or any other chain lacks. There are only a  few choices of drinks to choose from but.... it proves they are purists. And they do it RIGHT. All of it.   Baked goods are out of this world (hello butterscotch cookie with white chocolate).

I have no idea why it took me so long to get to this place!! Such a chill vibe with funky music to talk with a friend or significant other to for hours.  After eating at Sens around the corner (which is FAB BTW) my boyfriend took me to Rum Bar, as he'd been raving about their drinks for quite some time. The bar is separated from the restaurant by a small wall but both are quaint and cozy.  The drink list hosted many unique offerings. We ordered a vanilla mojito and then our favorite, a Dark & Stormy (ginger beer with Gosling's rum). Oh my God....the best mojito I have ever had. A little on the sweet side but such a unique flavor with quality vanilla extract in it. I can't wait to come back and try the food!

I have never been so relieved to have a pack of these guys by my side when I'm moving (or rather, watching others do my moving heh). I have used this company twice now and both times I was moved in less than half the time I expected!   Not only did they arrive at the time requested on the DOT, they worked incredibly fast and were done with my small apartment move in 2 hours! Nothing broken or lost either. Very very friendly guys and so professional as they call several days in advance to reconfirm. If you move during the week the prices absolutely can not be beat! I paid $250 total for my move which was well worth not having to do it on my own.

I hate that I love this salon so much, but I really do! I have NEVER walked out not looking fan F-ing tastic. Candace is my stylist and she is so awesome! Always understands my needs/concerns and is genuine with her work!  The front desk staff is a little, uh, "Scottsdale" if you will but.... I suppose they are trying to uphold a reputation. Whatever.  The most awesome thing about this place is that they always run specials either via Twitter or Facebook. You should never pay full price here! You can also catch Groupons, $50 for $100 worth of services for example.   I've only been to the Borgata location, so I can't speak about the others but I've never had a bad experience (:cough cough:: Carsten Institute).

There isn't any other place I think I could eat an entire order of hummus by myself.... This is the Real deal. Yeah it's in a crappy neighborhood, and the food is served on styrofoam, in a market that could use a major overhaul, but who cares?! The food is SO good.   I'm a vegetarian and have eaten at pretty much every middle eastern place in this city. This one unarguably has the best baba ganouj and hummus ever, as well as great tabbouleh. And that dessert with semolina on top of cheese? Heaven.

I must begin this review by stating how sad I am that I waited so long to discover this place. Really. OK, I'll be honest- it does have a little bit of a hippie-ish feel to it, but I am partially a team of that squad anyway so I really do not mind. It just makes me feel healthy to be around it.  We were seated right away, no air headed employees made us wait. I quickly decided on the Kaliedescope salad and my mom had a wrap with a side of the quinoa pilaf. My salad, at a whopping $15, was not nearly what I expected given I was trying to use it AS the meal : / Honestly, kind of a rip for that much but, it was a damn good salad. A little bit to salty but the mix of different ingredients was amazing. My mom's wrap was indeed quite large, but the quinoa pilaf that accompanied it was *amazing*!!! So, so flavorful.  We did not order dessert, mainly because their dessert portions are TINY and, well, I make raw vegan desserts at home myself. No need to buy them. Overall though, I will certainly return!!

As convenient as this place is given the proximity of their locations to my work and home, service has semmingly gotten worse over the years. The last 3 times I've had my car washed, I got it back to see that the dashboard had not even been wiped, nor the console and cup holders cleaned.   And, beware Joe Shmoe always trying to convince you to buy more you typically don't need. As soon as you drive up, 3 people will start observing your car for *anything* they can convince you you to need to have fixed.

I wasn't that sold on Tuck Shop the first time I visited.... I only had drinks but the limited bar was a turn off so I tried the homemade Dark&Stormy which is a fav of mine. The ginger ale was not gingery or sweet enough at all for me. The homemade tonic w/ vodka was great though!   Fast forward a few weeks and a date takes me there. Despite me being mostly vegan, they accommodated me pretty well! We ordered the pasta fries which were good but too heavy and unhealthy for me. I got a lovely salad and then the grilled vegetables and hummus, which was awesome! Vegetables were perfectly charred. I stole a bite of my date's waffles from the chicken and waffles he ordered. So, so amazing with a tender crumb.   Dessert was a chocolate lava cake with creme anglaise which was to DIE for. Oh man.....   Service was good but hopefully they will choose to expand their menu a bit more before I return.

Oh how I love the mellow feel of Postino. The people watching....the devouring of deliciously simple food and wine. I do NOT love the ridiculous wait times which seem to be a problem more often than not.  This location accommodated my birthday party which was really nice. The mixed greens salad with those devilishly good candied pecans and frizzled leeks is something I could eat buckets full of.   I don't understand the bruschetta bullshit though. Their bruschettas are largely bread! Little in the way of the toppings. Kind of a disappointment. And the bread isn't even THAT great (unless you were raised on shitty bread).

Hands down THEE best yogurt in the valley-bar none. It is NEVER icey. And their topping bar is always impeccably clean. The oatmeal cookie is seriously the best frozen dessert anything I've ever had. It is more expensive than other yogurt shops in the valley but OH so worth it!!

Seriously sub par on the soft serve yogurt craze. I have been to ALL the others, and this was seriously the worst. The yogurt is SO runny.... the flavors are mostly just "meh", nothing exciting, and the toppings do not look fresh at all.   On the few occasions I have been here, the employees seem to always be put out that you ask for samples. Hey-ya know what assholes? Don't insist on doing it YOURSELF then. Leave it to the customers. But do not be surly.  Yogurtology is hands down the best. No contest.

Please....do yourself a favor and do NOT waste your time or money. This club is for the most part ridiculous (as in, BAD).  I have been on 2 occasions: one for Kaskade and one for Above&Beyond. There are so many issues that they need to work on. Both times they had a hip hop opener on a house music night! WTF? The #4 DJ in the world and you open with lame ass hip hop (that's a bad DJ as it is)?? Way to drop the ball Marquee.....  Then, you probably pay off the fire marshall to WAY OVERPACK the club to levels where dangerous mobs of people will literally crush you between between. You can not walk anywhere... and everywhere you try and stand the bouncer says, "You have to move. You can't stand there. Sorry, you can't stand there either. You have to move." Move WHERE?!   The dancefloor is *tiny*. Too bad they wasted all the space on the patio. The stage/light show set up is amazing and the sound system good, BUT, amidst all the bad stuff, please... stay far, far away.   Side note: my girlfriend and her dude ordered 1 round of 2 drinks at the bar and the tab for those 2 drinks?? $55!!! Insane. Also, 80% of the club is asian so you better be OK with that too.

There are no words to describe how happy I am that there is a pizza place that has *dozens* of vegan offerings all over the menu, that are all more than good!!!  I ordered a "build your own" salad to start with spinach, broccoli, tomatoes, and tofu with herb vinaigrette. The BBQ tofu was not well marinated but it still tasted BBQ-ish.   We ordered the Mega veggie pizza, and asked for 100% daiya cheese on it, but it came out with only my half with Daiya because I said I was vegan. Disappointing for my boyfriend who now prefers Daiya over real cheese. Otherwise, the pizza was *fantastic*! The crust was nice and crispy all the way through, absolutely no sogginess. A generous amount of cheese too. I brought the manager over to thank him for having so many vegan options available! Sandwiches with tempeh, calzones with tofu and vegan cheese.... just so many wonderful things to choose from besides lame ass cheeseless pizza.   I will definitely return. The beer list is INSANE!

Seriously some of the best Iced coffee I've ever had (and I drink a lot of it!). They use a unique brewing technique for it and call it Iced Toddy. It takes the bitterness completely out of coffee. You will never go back to Starbucks after visiting this little hidden gem.

Been here a couple of times for breakfast on Sunday after a long bike ride with friends. Always bustling with activity, lots of which are ASU students.   I recommend going on a day that's nice enough to sit outside, the patio is great for people watching! It is a self-serve cafe so much more casual in nature than other breakfast eateries but the food is awesome for the price you pay. 3 huge, fluffy, perfect pancakes with mix-ins for $6.50. If you love pancakes as much as I do, these are some of the best.   If you're in the 'hood and can deal with the early closing hours, I definitely recommend this place amongst the many 'drab' eateries on Mill Ave.

Hello hot bartender Ron. Mmmm. I love the vibe in North, and how unique of a restaurant it is. Kinda barn looking on the outside, with servers all dressed in button up plaid shirts. So cute.  An interesting cocktail menu and small starters of crispy chickpeas and fruity olives got me going. I wish they had more vegetarian/cheese free items on the menu.... The pizza my friend ordered was good, at least the portion of crust I tried anyway. Nice and chewy and not burnt. Dessert of fall apple crumble was insanely good but also insanely small of a portion   : / coulda eaten buckets of it. Will definitely go back

I wasn't crazy about this place the first time I went but after subsequent visits it has grown on me majorly. And for two reasons : the patio! And the amazing beer selection.   I love that they give 3oz beer samples for $1. I tried several and they were all delicious. Add in the fact that the patio is VERY dog friendly- and frequently has good looking men at happy hour and you have one happy girl. My dog gets attention and I get buzzed and happy in the sun. Win win.  The food is very very average, I suggest sticking with a few filling microbrews.

Wow, finally found a clean, very good Indian restaurant in Tempe. After being loyal to Delhi Palace and a few others that recently have gone down the drain in terms of service or quality of the food or, especially, cleanliness and decor. I asked my Indian friends for recommendations and was given Chutney's info. To Yelp I went.   My father has been all over the world and is very critical of Americanized ethnic food but I brought him here and he was SO happy! We came for the lunch buffet, which was fantastic. I wished there were more dishes out that were without dairy, but the few that were there were fantastic and I left full but not feeling like I'd just eaten a grease bomb. Indian food can be very heavy and fatty, much of which I steer clear of now. The Naan on the buffet was cold and should have been replenished quicker than it was, but all the other dishes were amazing, especially the lentil dahl and the carrot halwah dessert.   I will certainly return to this place.
