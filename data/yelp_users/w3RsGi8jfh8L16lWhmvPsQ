I left and now I am back after spending some time at LA fitness.  You get what you pay for.  I never should have left.   The place makes you want to stay and work out.  I never felt that at other gyms.

Terrible.   When sushi smells fishy you know its not fresh. I hope I don't get food poisoning later since my stomach is upset already. Service was terrible also.   Maybe my expectations are too high dince I am Japanese and know good sushi.   Lucky for them there is not another sushi place in the area or they would be out of business.

I have sent several of my real estate clients here and they all rave about the prices and the service they receive.  I wouldn't think of sending my clients anywhere else.

I should have known better. Joe isn't a japanese name and trying to pass the this off as acceptable sushi is a crime.
