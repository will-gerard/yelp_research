Being from Michigan, I wasn't aware of the "hand car wash" luxury that appears to be so abundant here in the valley.  "Los" as my friends and I have named it, does a great job and for a measly $10 it's a pretty smokin' deal.  They start with a vacuum onto the wash and then final touches with a hand dry and a full interior clean!  Of course you can get fancy with some wax, or take it down a notch with a $6 exterior express!   Warning: They lost a star b/c they can take a while to finish your ride.  I usually come prepared with a latte and a New Times, or their on site Phx Downtown (better than the newtimes)... As long as you have up to 45 minutes to spare, it's well worth rolling out on McDowell with shiny wheels..!  You'll be ready to take on anything..

I remember the days of saving up for my $100 trim at Perry, the Aveda salon downtown.  I've had bangs, the curly "be curly", a pedicure, facial, yada yada waste of time and money! While I will never be over the delicious smell of Aveda products and continue splurging whenever I can afford it, no longer will I pay $25 for the extra blow dry!!! Nope, now I pay $25 for all of the bells and whistles at El y Ella.   In this no appointment, hip Mexico City style salon, you can walk in and walk out with a banging new do in about 45 minutes.  A complimentary dry is part of the package and while I might stop at "Perry" for some rosemary mint shampoo, that's about it.  I've found my spot!

This Mexican restaurant has the best burritos in town!  This is not your roach infested 24 hour drive through kind of burrito joint either.  Here are the reasons that make La Tolteca #1 and one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix! 1-Full bakery with mouth watering fresh pastries 2-Fresh ingredients and great prices 3-Also serves beer if you feel like having a Corona with your meal as opposed to take out 4-Little market has the best prices in town on citrus fruits and just enough of everything to cook up a little Mexican meal (Ranch Market not needed!) 5-Make your own pico/ salsa bar, make it your style and get as much of it as you want:) So, if you are downtown looking for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Of course it is super casual take out or seat yourself kind of place so don't  try to flatter your date here! But get there early, I'm pretty sure they close up shop by 9 or 10...

I loved the Merc Bar during my first visit, last week.  It had just the right amount of everything to feel like you're out for a night on the town, but not over the top.  I loved the music selection and was surprised that such a chic lounge could pull out the soul and 80's classics that I love!  They had a decent wine selection which is what I stuck to all night.  It was also a cozy place to get a table with friends and still chat under the dim lights and awesome decor. All that being said, I'm sorry that I missed out on this place all of my years in downtown Phoenix.  Perfect location from all over the valley and a great experience.

I can honestly say that you would've never caught me in this place if it hadn't been for my boyfriend suggesting it as one of our first dates.  The things that scared me away: valet parking and an overcrowded parking lot and the assumed pretentious wine snobs that frequent the area.  Of course, I was right about these concerns when I actually tried the place.  However....that doesn't mean that it can't be enjoyed with the right company.  The wine choices are unbeatable and they have a great app menu, of which I highly recommend the bruchetta (you can choose different several different toppings for one order and they were all equally delicious).  It's a great place to chat with friends, or go on a weeknight to grab some vino.  I'm not dying to go back anytime soon, so it's not a favorite for me.  However, I can see how some people would make this wine bar a regular stop.

This has been my sanctuary for the last five- years I have lived in Phoenix.  Whenever I need to burn some extra calories, think about life, escape from the concrete, or contemplate a major decision, I head for the hills!   I love to hike and having trails so near is pretty much incomparable.  It's hard to decide what my favorite part of this massive desert mountain preserve  might be, the accessibility, the low low cost of nothing (that's right gratis), or the reward of looking out over our beloved city (and the lovely layer of smog on a nice day) when you make it to the top...  The Alta trail is my favorite, mostly because the mountain bikers can't do this trail and it's really only worthy by foot.  Meaning that you don't have to worry that some spandex might run you over at any second, you can be one with nature, deep in thought and not hear the whiz of the spokes coming up behind you.  Also due to one of the roads being blocked off 95% of the time, you have to walk a half-mile to get to the trail head.  For those that don't like a little extra exercise this could be an inconvenience, for me it's a filter.  Not too many people end up on the trail, I usually pass one or two at the most.  Now that is serenity...!  This park serves many other purposes beyond a typical hiker like myself, such as: horseback riding, festivals, motor-cross, mountain biking, grills & picnic tables, and you can even catch some vendors up on top if you're just there for a drive!   Advice: To stay safe always let someone know where you are headed, this is the desert and it can be dangerous! I've seen coyotes a couple of times, which are harmless, but there are also rattle snakes, and an intense heat that should not be taken lightly...Bring lots of water and be prepared for little shade...I have had a couple of accidents with my dog involving paws and cacti :( she survived but it wasn't pretty... Have fun!

This place is perfection! After going a few times with my boyfriend, I can see how one could crave some chicken and waffles on a Sunday morning.  Don't sleep in too late though because you will wait if you hit the church crowd.  Don't skip the grits!

This classic steakhouse has won me over.  I have been on a few occasions, both special and random!  As mentioned in the other reviews the decor has not changed a bit.  It still boasts weird pictures hanging on the wall of some unnamed man (hmmm? Mr. Durant himself)!? I always opt for the bar area weather having dinner or not.  I'm not one for big dining rooms and don't mind eating at the bar, especially with the excellent service the bartender offers.  This is a favorite among my friends for birthdays, happy hours, and of course Valentine's Day! (with your friends or your significant other:) My favorites on the menu: garlic mashed potatoes, fillet mignon, scallops, and all of the salads.   Go, dine, enjoy it is worth the extra dollars:)

I love Cibo! Everything about this place is great.   Perfect for: -Dinner with mom.  My mom came to visit and this was our Friday night dinner spot.  We walked from my apartment, had a glass of wine while waiting for a table to open on the adorable patio, and then indulged in salad, pizza, and even desert.  -Holiday staff party.  I was in charge of booking reservations for our holiday staff party.  I wanted a place with great food that wouldn't be too over the top for a bunch of teachers.  Not only was the food great, but the service was amazing.  They put us in the back "Carriage House", with our own waiter/bartender.  The ambiance was perfect and it was in a central location for those of us who wanted to continue the night at a nearby bar.  -Date. My boyfriend and I can walk here for take out, but we have also had a very romantic date here and I can't wait to go back.  The tree and flower covered patio just does it for me. This is my definition of an urban pizzeria!

Copper star wins five stars from me! I've enjoyed two visits to this lovely little coffee house in the melrose district of 7th ave, both have been delightful.  The owner was very nice in giving me an extra stamp on the "punch" card for my first visit.  I am a big fan of being rewarded for my loyalty so after 9 drinks (from apple juice to plain ole "drip") you get a 10th free (and we're talking lattes!)... There is a diverse quiet crowd here, and everyone pretty much keeps to themselves in a good way.  The music was not over the top, but current and enjoyable.   The shabby art on the walls is kind of fun to look at while they are steaming up that extra foam. I've sat outside both times and have been inspired to do a little after coffee antiquing, although I have yet to venture off of the patio with my latte. All in all, A+, great coffee, delicious strawberry cupcakes, good people, chill atmosphere..

I'm giving the Roosevelt 2 stars because that's exactly what it deserves.  I've tried, and I thought about trying again, and then I did try again..but it was closed, apparently Monday night is not suitable for business, along with lunch time and early happy hour.   Beyond the schedule: 1) Drink selections are no good either.   Sure the beer is great, but if you're a wine drinker like myself, be ready to settle for one of the daily selections posted on the chalkboard! 2) Decor is about as boring as the clientele in this place.  I think I've heard some of the worst jokes of my life there. 3)My friends' car once was locked in the parking lot shortly after closing time had to get it the next day. ...add some spice or I'd much rather stay home...

I love the downtown market.  It's a little sprout itself and I am proud to have watched it grow!  Although I'm sure (I know) that it doesn't compare to some other farmer's markets around the country, it still earns 5 stars! All of the produce is local, organic, and fresh.  It's a cool atmosphere that occasionally hosts live music and always has a good option of ready to eat lunch or dinner.  Last time I was there we ordered tamales, and a vegan burro, tasty! I also noticed a veggie lentil soup. The market doesn't stop at produce and ready to eat meals, a bakery full of your sweet favorites is there, and several local artists who are selling their craft from essential healing oils to origami. The market is open 2 times a week.  I enjoy walking over on Wednesday evenings when the market stays open until 8, check it out and you won't be disappointed.  Even if not to shop, the chill experience is fun!

I used to work at a Lebanese restaurant/bar for years.  And...I'm from Michigan which gives me a fair position to judge Middle Eastern food, as Michigan is crawling with homemade pita and baba to die for..This place is not about gyros or belly dancers, it's a real deal Middle Eastern deli.  I agree fully with the average 4 star rating losing one star ONLY for lack of atmosphere.  But, if you are craving falafel, warm pita, hummus, or chicken schwarma for lunch than this is your place.    Nothing on the menu will disappoint!

If this isn't love than I don't know what is! I headed off for a Cubs game on my spring break, thanking the lucky starts I had entered the field of education, complete with bottom of the barrel salaries and a lifetime of spring breaks! I had briefly looked up a few stadiums around town after listening to others go on and on about how great this 'spring training' in Phoenix gig is.  We decided on Hohokam mainly for the team (my boyfriend is a Cubs fan), and secondly for the stadium, supposedly complete with Chicago style dogs and old style brew.    When we arrived I noticed herds of people happily walking from far away parking lots for the sold-out game.  Sold out! On a Thursday for spring training! Yes it's true but luckily we scored 3 lawn seats (just what I was looking for a grassy spot in the sun), for just over double the $6 face value.  After beering up and finding our perfect spot I proceeded to watch not a second of baseball.  However, I did use the innings as a measure of when I should get another beer, or checkout the Italian sausage sandwich, and yes I have been craving it everyday since!  Spring training is a blast I HIGHLY recommend it for all!

This place is just down right no good.  I have been there several times so I do feel qualified to yelp about it.  First of all, it's in a strip mall (typical of Phoenix).  It is a very small "club", which is trying hard to be a sort of Rogue knock-off.  The deejay's seem inexperienced and I still haven't figured out why they wear head phones to plug in their ipods of mismatched music and failed beats.  The crowd is usually stumbling over each other, gathered out front to smoke fags in their skinny jeans.  It must be 18 and up, has to be...  The only thing great about this place is the lit up dance floor which make your shoes feel like dancing, but as mentioned before as soon as the play-list starts the strip mall sidewalk calls you out to smoke.  It's kind of like high school when hanging out in parking lots was the cool thing to do, go if you wish! But, if you're looking for a black hair, straight bangs, skinny jeans, indie experience, skip this strip mall locale and head straight for Rogue.   (oh yeah they do have strong drinks contributing to the 2 star rating)

My boyfriend and I were really excited to check this place out.  We really love wine, and live downtown so we decided to give it a go, I think it was a Thursday.  We have been to other bars on the block and enjoy the feeling of a bar "district" of sorts.   After taking 10+ minutes to find a parking space (we should have walked), we were ready for a glass of wine.  Approaching the bar everything looked like a go! The decor was unique to the area and tasteful.  Although it was empty we walked in anyhow without a cover in sight.  We walked out just as quickly as we walked in when the music drastically changed to top 40 crap!  And the two customers in the bar immediately jumped up and started dancing to go right along with it.  Was it an off night?  We really just wanted a new wine bar, with maybe some jazz and a cool atmosphere.  We were left very disappointed, maybe we will have to try on another night? We didn't even make it far enough to see the wine list...

I went to the new 'Nous' with my girlfriends a couple of weeks ago and we had a blast.  Of course there was the standard no card, and a $5 cover that Friday night, but it was well worth the ATM fee.    This is the kind of place you can hear some blues, reggae, soul, and disco to boggie the night away.  I preferred to drink a mixed cocktail and do the twist for most of the night and had a fabulous time.  There is limited seating and it does get crowded (with good reason), so arrive early or plan on spending your night on the dance floor!   The staff is straight forward and they get the job done well, music is top notch for Phoenix, the capital of non blues bar having cities..! have fun!

Ugh! After an afternoon spent at home depot picking out doors and faucets for our first house, my lovely and I had worked up an appetite.  We knew we wanted a patio, probably a brew, some lunch and a comfy table to discuss the handful of paint swatches we had in tow.  So, Tempe was the answer until on our way there we noticed this retro looking hamburger joint with a Miller High-life banner hanging in the window.  We decided to skip the drive and go for it, there was even a patio. We walked up and the first thing we saw was a freaky mannequin dressed in a stripper/"nurse" outfit placed in the window of the 500 sq ft building.  As soon as we entered the front door, it became clear that the mannequin wasn't the only one sporting this skimpy attire.  The waitresses also had on cheeky skirts, white fishnets, and boobs popping out of their blouses.  This was a sorry attempt as the class of the place left me feeling like I was at some Mesa dive bar, or better yet Band-Aids with burgers.  Creepy men were scattered throughout the tiny place drooling.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any stranger (or funnier!) I spotted the makeshift  bulletin board of the waitresses (all 2 of them) with 50+ pictures of them complete with handwritten captions, and numerous old creepy men like the ones there that afternoon.  It was hard for to believe this place was real, or that someone actually took it seriously! With grumbling bellies and confused looks on our faces we decided to order a couple of PBR's (either PBR or High-life the only 2 choices of brew), and took it to the cement patio.  After a brief glance at the one page menu: Hamburger, double, hot-dog, or fries, we decided to chug our 3 buck beers and find another lunch spot. Summing it all up, my bf said to me "I'm sure the burgers would've been good, I would just never eat there", followed by "Hey, they're just trying to make a buck".   Try harder...What a waste of a great location.

I don't understand why everyone is giving this local coffee shop such a hard time.  I have been a patron for years and have few complaints.  Sure sometimes their credit card machine is down, I would NEVER eat the food, and the new local is kind of shady, but hands down the coffee is delicious and addicting.  It's no Seattle, but neither is Phoenix! This place is laid back with character and non a pretentious staff.  It's not Lux (thank God), and it is not Starbucks (x2)..It's simply a great place to catch up with a friend, study, read, or grab an afternoon pick-me-up. The new area is a little sketchy and every time I have been there I have been asked for change or a smoke, I just started saying no.. My drink rec: a sugar free, chai charger, with water...little calories, lots of charge, and very tasty!
