Sorry Canaletto.  I so wanted to have the best Italian dinner in St. Mark's Square, but instead what I got was a glorified Olive Garden.  Not impressed at all.  I got the Pizza con salsiccia which I absolutely love. It looks just like it does on the streets of Venice, but tastes NOTHING like it.  Sorely disappointed.  The service basically sucked.  They sat us right next to the kitchen and the bathrooms so we got to see all this yummy food being sent out of the kitchen, of course none of it was ours.  Finally it took maybe 30 minutes to get our food and when they brought it, it was cold.  My friends were also not impressed with their food.  I highly recommend going some place else.

Screw all these Vegas strip restaurants!  I was in Vegas and I knew I wanted to go somewhere more local and affordable.  Paymon's definitely delivered.  One of my friends that lives in Vegas took me here to for some good Mediterranean food.  It's a casual place, but the food is fantastic and the service is friendly.  I had the koobideh (ground beef) with the rice, which is my favorite dish and it was delish.  The portions are big, just the way I like 'em.  Perfectly seasoned with just the right about of fat/juice ratio.  Would definitely come here again next time I'm in town!

I haven't been to many gay bars in Phoenix, so after Yelping my options, I decided on Icepics. It looks rather unassuming on the outside, but once you walk in, the space is fairly large and the bar extends back quite a bit. They have TONS of alcohol here and there's really no drink they can't make.   We didn't know, but it was happy hour and I was served a pretty heavy pour. It didn't take long until I turned into my cheap-date-red-Asian-glow look. I'd say this visit was a success.   They have a separate room they use for drag performances, and sad that I had to leave before the show started, but it looks like it would've been awesome. The bartenders are very nice and the crowd looks diverse. Can't wait to go back and get red again!

I cannot begin to explain this place.  XS has a long ass line, the drinks are expensive, the cost for bottle service can feed a small country, and the bouncers are ass holes....But it's totally worth it!  Don't bother waiting in line.  Get bottle service.  That's the only way you can hope to get in if you're a guy.  And if you're a lady, try wear something with more boobage so they'll let you in...and so the guys will want to dance with you.  Or so a cute guy will want to dance with you.  Straight guys love boobs.  I noticed that this weekend.  Hands down, probably the best club in Vegas right now.

Naked dancing men wearing duct tape over their privates--my fave!   Compared to the other gay-friendly clubs in the vicinity, it's closer (on strip) than Share and nicer than Piranha.  If you manage to get on the guest list, you can get in for free and the line wasn't very long when we arrived. If you're with a group, I highly recommend getting a table with bottle service so you have a place to sit.   It's not a huge space compared to the mega clubs, but it's fairly large. The main room has a bar and a dance floor with tables surrounding. The second room was playing hip hop/pop mashups. I'm not a huge fan of mashups, but that's just my own preference. Not a huge deal. I liked the small performances they would have on the stage. The staff was friendly and so was the security, which is kind of refreshing.   As far as clientele goes, I'd say that if you go to an off-strip gay club, you're going to see a ratio of 60/40 locals to visitors. I had the sense that Liaison's ratio of visitors was much higher due to the location and vibe. What sells this place for me is definitely the location and newness. I'd imagine the vibe changes each night depending on what's going on, so I'd recommend checking out their site for the most up-to-date info.

I've seen ads for the Saguaro and was excited to see what all the hype was about.  This hotel probably isn't the best if you have kids that need peace and quiet.  Don't get me wrong...it's nice, but the party/fun vibe is quite apparent.  Some of these negative reviews on Yelp are shocking.  Luckily for me, my experience here was quite pleasant.  Check in was super easy and fast.  The lobby is really cute with a cool bar in the back.  If you're hungry, there's Distrito which is a really great restaurant located inside the hotel.  The guest rooms are on the other side of the property, so you're going to have to walk (maybe further than you're used to) to your room with your bags.  Upon getting to our room, we discovered our key cards didn't work on the door so we had to walk all the way back to the front desk to redo our keys.  A bit of a hassle, but hey, these things happen.  Upon entering our room, we were pleasantly surprised.  It was comfortable, and everything looked nice and updated.  Flat screen, clock radio with iPod dock, nice toiletries, and cute modern bathroom.  I wasn't expecting all the updated amenities seeing how the buildings looked a bit older.  The pool was nice, complete with padded lounge chairs and a convenient poolside bar.  I was able to peek into the fitness center and it's really big with brand new super nice equipment.  I think it rivals some of the best hotel gyms I've seen.  For what it is, The Saguaro doesn't disappoint.  It's a casual hotel with some elegant touches.  If you're used to staying at B&B's or lavish resorts, I'd suggest sticking to what you know.   If you want something cool and different, check out the Saguaro!
