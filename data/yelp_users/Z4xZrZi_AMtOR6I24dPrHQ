I'm not a member of Costco, but I use their pharmacy for my dog's glaucoma medication. I called in her medication refill on a Saturday morning before they opened and the automated system said it wouldn't be ready 'til Monday. I left a voicemail requesting the refill by that afternoon.   I went to the store just after 12 and it was obvious that they hadn't checked their voicemail. The refill wasn't ready and the cashier at the pharmacy directed me to speak to the pharmacist at the new prescription drop-off window to see if they even had my dog's medication on hand. Why couldn't she do that?   So instead of my prescription being ready as requested (and they had plenty of time to check their voicemail), they had to process it as a new prescription which took 15-20 minutes.

This is the best music store in Phoenix. They have a great selection of sheet music and the staff is super friendly and helpful. If they don't have a piece you need, they will find it online and print it for you. They go the extra mile and do things like make sure it's in the key you need.   They are super knowledgeable and make sure you have all the information you need related to your purchase. I was in there yesterday to get a choir performance binder and a piece of sheet music. While one clerk (who I think is the owner) was finding my music online, the other clerk was taking the time to talk with a father and son (probably 8-10 years old) about the son's first violin and the proper way to care for the bow. He was patient and thorough with them - excellent customer service.

I went here the other night for an ice cream sundae with hot fudge and caramel sauce on it. I was disappointed that the hot fudge was overly sweet and gritty, like it was made from a powder mix that wasn't mixed enough.   The service was good, as was the remainder of my sundae.

This is a great hardware store in terms of service, products, and their convenient location. From the outside it looks small, but it's bigger than it looks. They have a large variety of products and the staff is super helpful and attentive. I much prefer to shop here than the big box hardware stores. They always have what I need and they didn't bat an eye when I brought my basset hound in with me once.

The staff at this shop is outstanding. They make you walk barefoot before they bring out shoes for you and take you outside to jog in each pair you try on. They are dedicated to making sure you get shoes that fit your feet and your needs. This is my go-to place whenever I need running shoes.   The staff are more than clerks. They are runners themselves and very knowledgeable about running.  Did I mention you get a discount on apparel when you buy shoes? These guys are freakin' awesome!  You might have to pay a little extra here compared to other sporting good stores, but the service more than makes up for the price. Other stores make you fend for yourself.

I went here for lunch with a colleague. They put us in a back booth which was perfect - quiet enough for us to get some work done. He had the fish tacos and seemed to enjoy them. I have the palette of a five year-old so I ordered a chicken quesadilla with refried beans added. It was delicious - way too much for one meal. The server was attentive but not overbearing. I was a little concerned about parking because that's an issue for a lot of restaurants on that strip of Camelback but since we met there at 1pm on a Friday, we had no problem with that.

I had a business lunch here recently and we had a wonderful time. The portions here are pretty big so we were both fine with ordering one item each a la carte. She had a tostada; I had a bean burrito. It was just the right amount. And their chips are delicious. It was quiet enough that we could have a conversation at normal volume and the staff was friendly and attentive without being over bearing.

They were they only I've ever visited that would let you try them on. When they didn't have the colors we wanted in stock, they took our numbers and said they'd call when they got them in.

I visited this "Tempe institution" last night and I enjoyed myself. Good customer service, good food. My friend and I both had the all-beef jumbo dog and fries. I like that they have veggie options and gluten-free buns. I also appreciated that they had dill pickles and not just sweet pickle relish.   I had a great time - very mellow and laid back...perfect for two friends who like hot dogs and good conversation.  When I come back, I think I want to try the 'white hot" sausage and a milkshake.

Capitol Collision did an awesome job on my car. They helped coordinate repairs with the insurance company, my rental car, and walked me through the whole process. I was in a little fender bender so they were able to fix my car and repaint my bumper in one day. They also cleaned the entire interior of my car - I swear it looks better today than the day I bought it.   I also love that Capitol is family/locally owned so I know my money is going right back into my community.

My steak-loving friend came to town so I suggested we do dinner at Durant's. We went on a Tuesday evening and I was pleased to see that it was still fairly busy when we walked in at 7:30. I love the classic feel of this restaurant - the staff is friendly, super polite, and polished in their bow ties. They were attentive without being overbearing.  He had a filet with garlic mashed potatoes and a small wedge salad. He devoured that steak. I had the salmon with mango glaze (nice kick without overpowering the fish) and a baked potato. We ordered a size of lobster mac and cheese for the table that was to die for. We finished off the meal by splitting a slice of cheesecake - so so good!

This is a great place to get gelato - wonderful flavors (and the friendly staff will give you as many samples as you want) and a cozy atmosphere. It's also attached to Hava Java which is nice if you or someone in your group is seeking a caffeine kick.   My only quibble is that it was a little noisy from the A/C or the display cases - but I have sensitive hearing.

I had lunch here with a colleague recently and we had a wonderful time. It was bit too chilly to sit in their lovely garden so we sat inside where it was more cozy.   Lunch was excellent. I had the Polpette (meatball sandwich) and my friend had the PLT, both with a side salad. My sandwich was one of the best meatball sandwiched I'd ever had. The bread was chewy; the meat was flavorful; and the cheese was melted to perfection. The portion size for the sandwich and salad was perfect.  The only thing this place has going against it is a lack of parking. I got there early so I could get free parking on the street about a block away (I don't believe in paying for parking when possible). There were meters and they have a complementary valet too for people willing to pay to park.

Bookmans is a great used bookstore. The staff is very friendly and helpful. One thing to keep in mind is it is a used bookstore - the entire stock is used so don't expect them to have the newest book on hand - I made that mistake.   I've also sold books here too and the process is fair. It's a much better deal to get store credit than cash.

I went here with my parents to celebrate my and my mom's birthdays. My parents are foodies and I have the palette of a five year-old so picking restaurants is challenging at times. We'd never been there before and navigating the farm in the dark was a bit of an adventure.   The food, the service, and the ambiance of this restaurant are top notch.  The food was good but a little too foo-foo for me. My parents loved it.

I attended a lunch event today that was catered by Jason's Deli. I was pleasantly surprised that they had a gluten-free lunch box for me. It had a turkey sandwich on gluten-free bread  and the bread was good! The chips and pickle were of course gluten free too. I'm pretty sure the craisin-oatmeal cookie was not gluten-free but it was good. (I'm sensitive to gluten but I don't have Celiac, and the lunch came with a warning that the deli's kitchen is not gluten-free and cross contamination is likely.)

I popped by this Starbucks because I wanted a scone. I appreciated that the calorie count was posted. Since I last had a Starbucks scone, they've changed the shape of their scones and the barista warmed it up without asking me. I don't like warm scones. I like their old scones better - at room temperature.

I met Steve at the Local First Arizona Fall Festival and he was so sweet. I hadn't bought a mattress in over a decade and I was nervous about getting the wrong one. I visited the shop a few weeks later (with my pillow) and he staff was super helpful. They showed me a lot of different mattresses in my price range and that fit my body needs. (I like a firmer mattress.) They encouraged me to really spend time on each one and get a feel for it. I never felt pressured or rushed. They never seemed annoyed when I walked back and forth between the two mattresses I was considering - repeatedly laying on each one. I bought my mattress on a Saturday and the crew delivered it on Sunday and hauled away my old sunken mattress. They were in and out in less than 5 minutes!

I had my car serviced here recently. I was pleased I could have the appointment time I wanted with only a few days' notice. My attendant was courteous, professional, and respected my decisions regarding my car maintenance. I had two quibbles regarding my recent visit:   #1 - When they called with the inspection results and suggested additional maintenance, they gave me an expected time of completion. When there was a delay, they didn't call me so I showed up at the expected completion time and my car wasn't ready for about another 90 minutes.   #2 - They washed my car but there were still spots on the hood from a recent bird bombing. They did an excellent job wiping down and vacuuming the interior.

I went here for lunch after a morning of medical tests. I had to fast through breakfast so I was starving. The falafel pita and grilled veggies hit the spot. Ethan the server was friendly and attentive. The food was delicious. Warning - the grilled veggies have quite a bit of garlic in them. I definitely needed a mint after that. The pita was delicious - great flavor in the falafel on chewy soft pita bread.   The thing that made Pita Jungle lose a star was their bathroom - the water in the sink doesn't stay on unless you're holding it down and the soap came out of the dispenser so forcefully it spattered on my shirt - neither are deal-breakers, but things I noted.

I'm a minimalist so I only buy things when I need them and when I buy stuff I want high quality items with some personality to them. This store is great for people like me. Everything is handmade by an Arizona artist and everything is beautiful and has a practical purpose. And I love that the layout of the store is open, simple, and clean. Overly cluttered stores make me crazy.

We went to US Egg today & it was terrible! The place was packed, which made it excessively noisy. The service was very slow, and when our food finally arrived, half of our group was given a cold meal. My friend ordered bacon and it was so badly undercooked that it was inedible. I requested that the chef substitute bacon for the ham in my breakfast burrito, and they got it wrong and left the meat out completely.  We were very disappointed with the experience, and we we will not be back. I think this is a place that does not function well when they have a full restaurant all morning.

Brand X does an amazing job creating custom t-shirts and whatever else I want. They are my go-to place when I need a custom shirt or gift.  They have turned me into a t-shirt snob because the quality of their shirts is so good that I can't buy cheap t-shirts anymore. I've brought in some challenging projects and they creative and attentive staff has always found a way to make it work.

The food is quite good too and they have many options for  people with gluten sensitivities. The only problem I have with Luci's is the tables are spaced too close together.

I would give them zero stars if I could.   I had a terrible experience with this company. My complex had a deal with them to do some mandatory upgrades to our plumbing so I hired them instead of my usual guy. My appointment was first thing on a Tuesday morning (8am-noon slot). When no one had shown up or called by 9:30am, I called them. They said they have a team meeting on Tuesday morning and crews were just being dispatched for the day. The crew came within my slot and got the work done...  And then I came home from work the next day and my kitchen was flooded. They made a mistake under my sink and it had been dripping for over 24 hours. I called them and someone came out to fix it. While he was doing so, he told me that the first guy did a poor job...  Two days later I ran my dishwasher, and it ran without water. Thinking it was a different problem, I called my home warranty provider and they sent a tech who said the issue was when plumber #2 was under my sink, he turned off my hot water and didn't turn it back on. I called Alliance to get reimbursed for the fix-it fee for the other plumber and the customer service rep balked at paying me. I had to go through a manager to get it resolved. I never plan to hire this company again.

Today was my first trip to Yogurtini & I was impressed. I'm generally not a fan of frozen yogurt because it's not as creamy as ice cream & it can have a chemically aftertaste. That was not the case here. All the yogurts I tested were flavorful: vanilla, chocolate, dulce de leche, & caramel macchiato. It tasted more like soft serve than yogurt. The only thing I would have changed is that I wished they had one or two more fruit flavors in today's selection.

I love that you can review the menu online and see the nutritional information for the items as prepared and if you omit ingredients. I had the Turkey Waldorf salad, modified to be gluten-free and with lower calories and it was delicious. It was so fresh and flavorful and the portion was huge (which I love). I loved that even with a full restaurant it wasn't so loud that you couldn't hear your dining partners.

Great people - highly recommend.

I had lunch with a friend here last week on a Thursday. We got there at 11:30 to avoid the lunch crowd. I liked that the menu had many options for spiciness ranging from not spicy to double Thai spicy. I ordered chicken chow mein, mild - because I like a little kick but not much. The portion of meat was generous; the noodles were unremarkable and the sauce had no kick at all. The spring roll that came with it was crunchy and delicious. My dining partner had the shrimp Thai fried rice and enjoyed it. I've had better Thai food other places in Phoenix, but this place will work if you're craving Thai food in downtown Phoenix.

If I'm doing a business networking coffee meeting in Scottsdale, Cartel is one of my go-to places - delicious coffee and my companion said their tea was excellent. Even though it wasn't on the official menu they made me a hot chocolate.   Cartel has good ambiance for getting work done - a lot of people sit at the tables with their laptops and earbuds. There are plenty of outlets to go around.  The staff is super friendly and mellow which I love.

I went to Flip Dunk today for a party where all the guests were adults. I stopped by once before to check out their long tumbling trampoline. I was disappointed to learn that this was off limits during the party. This is what I looked forward to the most.  Before we could jump we all had to sign waivers that basically said we're responsible for our actions and the company is not liable for anything that goes wrong. I usually don't mind these but then I saw the jumping area - it was a grid of small trampolines separated by padding. There were lots of little little kids running around, crossing trampolines without paying attention to where they were going or whose way they might be getting in. The staff seemed friendly but they did nothing to stop this dangerous running around. The only rules they seemed to enforce were the rules against sitting or laying on the trampolines and against bringing phones and cameras on the trampolines.   I'm surprised more kids didn't get hurt. I used to be an advanced gymnast so I was doing flips and split jumps. Several kids ran into me while running across my trampoline. Several parents were sitting upstairs, supposedly watching and none of them yelled at their kid to watch where they were going. I was pretty sure I was going to hit, kick, or land on a kid during the hour that we were there. It started to annoy me but then my fellow adult jumper reminded me that if that happened, the parents had signed the same waiver as me.  I don't intend to return and I would never encourage a parent to take their child here. It's too dangerous.

Office Max is an acceptable store for office supplies if you don't need any help, especially if you belong to an organization that gets you a discount. Otherwise shop somewhere else.   I recently went here to buy some furniture for my new office. I was ignored the whole time I was perusing the furniture area - probably 20 minutes and there was almost no other customers in the store. I placed the order for a desk and chair and paid extra to have both pieces delivered and the desk assembled. They were completely misleading about how this process worked. My desk was delivered on 1/8/2015 but the assembly team wouldn't be out to put it together until 1/16/2015! I ended up putting my desk together myself and getting a refund. I was disappointed also to see that my desk top had a dent and crack in it - not bad enough to make them replace it, but bad enough that I'll never buy furniture from these guys again.  I wrote a post about the whole experience if you want to read it: http://bit.ly/1xgjPju.

I went to a networking event at Lustre and we had a pretty bad experience. Our server was inattentive - about half our people had to go to the bar for drinks. (There were ~10 people in our group.) The flat breads were good but the rest of the food we ordered was bland. Our bill was all messed up - wrong prices for items and it took them way too long to figure out how to get a voided copy of the wrong bill for our hosts records.   One of our group members asked for her the bill and she said she saw our server drinking a martini instead of getting it for her.  The ambiance and the view from the rooftop was very nice, but overall, I don't recommend this place.

Twirl is a good place to get self-serve froyo and toppings. The caramel and nutella froyo are very good! They have a good topping selection and the clerk even offered to get me fresh toppings from the back when I told her I was gluten-intolerant to ensure that they hadn't had any other gluten-containing toppings dropped in the bins. I like that they have whipped cream available too. The only significant quibble I had was that the large table was a little too big for people who were trying to converse while sitting across from each other.

Eeko designed my postcards for an upcoming special mailing. They came out so gorgeous! And they delivered them to my office. The designer was super easy to work with and was very responsive to my feedback. I'm not very creative when it come to projects like this but they were able to take my muddled verbal descriptions of what I thought I wanted and gave me three options and we turned one of them into a postcard that I absolutely love. I strongly recommend these guys for your projects.  And they're a member of Local First Arizona and I'm a big fan of supporting local businesses when I can.

The food at Matt's is quite good. My issue is with the service. I'm gluten-intolerant and so I asked for my breakfast that normally comes with potatoes and toast to have extra potatoes instead of toast. I was taken aback when the server said no substitutions were allowed, not even for food sensitivities. I understand that a small restaurant that wants to turn tables quickly may not allow substitutions for any reason, but then they should clearly state that on the menu. I probably won't be back.

My friend and I had lunch here and had a wonderful time. He had the Roosevelt bagel and a vegan oatmeal banana cookie. I had the black bean soup. The food was so fresh and the environment was so inviting. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the mild sunny day.

The brisket was smokey and tender with an awesome barbecue sauce. The mac 'n' cheese was perfect comfort food. The staff was totally sweet too and told me the story of how they bought the truck in Florida and drove it across the country while they were making my lunch.  I highly recommend these guys.

I had lunch here with a friend today during the Art Detour. The place was full but they did something really nice and they would put 2 groups of 2 on a 6-top to get us seated faster. It worked out great. Once we were seated, the service was super slow. I think we waited 15 minutes before someone came to take our order. The food was five stars but the slow service took them down a notch.  I had the breakfast scramble and oh my goodness it was good - eggs, sausage, cheese, peppers, green chilis, and mushrooms on naan. It was delicious.  My friend had the Igby dog - vegetarian - her favorite. She also had a ginger ale and said it was really good.  I'll be back, but probably not when it's so busy.

My friend and I had breakfast here recently. I had pancakes and sausage. He had a Denver omelet. Service was fast and our coffee was regularly topped off. It's the kind of place you feel comfortable hanging out and chatting even after your meal is done. It was good diner fare food in a welcoming environment. There was a little jar of jam on the table and at first I was excited that it might be blackberry (but it wasn't), but it was still good. I felt very welcome and cozy here.

I've been to two events that had box lunches from Saddlecreek and each time was delicious. It's about as good as a business box lunch gets. The sandwiches are made with the most wonderful bread from a local bakery and the chocolate cookies are awesome.  I've had their fruit bread too at a conference and it was wonderful. I've heard they sell out of pastries every day. I wish they were able to bring more of their baked goods.

My friend and I went to the new Steak 'n Shake tonight. His friends raved about it so we decided to check it out. We were pretty disappointed. The burgers and fries taste like what you'd find at any other fast food restaurant but the other places are a lot cheaper. The milkshakes left a lot to be desired.  So we came, we tried, and we won't be back again.

I went to this Zia store for the first time - great selection and super friendly staff. When they didn't have what I was looking for, they contacted another Zia location that had it and arranged for it to be sent to this store for pick up.

We went here for lunch after my friend's graduation from ASU. There were 6 of us in the group and we had a wonderful time. I liked the simplicity of the restaurant - both in the concept and decor. The food was flavorful and delicious. I had one of the Italian pasties and it was like a folded pizza. It's a great place for a casual meal with friends.

I met a business contact here for lunch - it was delicious. We both had the street tacos on corn tortillas, each with a different filling. I had roasted chicken, pulled pork, and fish. They came with beans and rice. The rice was creamy and the beans were well cooked too.   My only quibble with my experience is I don't like raw tomatoes and I purposely selected tacos that didn't have tomatoes on them, but 2 of my 3 tacos had diced tomato on them that I had to pick off. Next time I'll tell the server "No raw tomatoes anywhere on the plate, please" regardless of what the menu says.

I had a business lunch here last week and it was great. I had their Shotgun Lunch Special - two tacos and tortilla soup for under $10. It was more than what I could eat so that was a great value. The flavors were quite good and I appreciate that a number of their offerings are gluten-free and well-marked in the menu.  The staff was impressive. I told them that I was meeting people and we needed to be able to talk, she selected a table that let us sit closer to each other. And when one of my dining companions knocked a glass bottle of hot sauce off the table and broke it, the staff was over in the flash and cleaned it up in under two minutes.  I really love that the owners. who have several restaurants in the area, bought a lot and turned it into extra parking.

I had to furnish a new place recently. I am generally indecisive so the prospect of buying all new furniture was overwhelming. The staff at Living Spaces doesn't get commission so they're helpful and not pushy. I teamed up with one of their designers who looked at my floor plan and helped me pick out pieces that fit my needs, personality, and budget. She made the process so easy - 5 stars for her!  The delivery is where they lose a star. I was given a 3-hour window for my delivery. The delivery guys arrived 45 minutes after the end of my 3-hour window and they delivered a box spring that had a 3-inch rip in the fabric so we had to schedule an exchange. Again I had a 3-hour window for the delivery (3pm-6pm) and they arrived at 5:55. The third delivery was my custom couch and they arrived well within the delivery window and delivered it with no problems..

I met a business contact here for lunch recently. The place is really small so I strongly recommend making a reservation - which they will do for a group of 2. I had the pulled pork and it was excellent.  Even though the place is small and busy, we never felt rushed. I really enjoyed the whole experience.

My friend and I went to breakfast here today. I know they're packed on the weekend, but during the week it's almost empty first thing in the morning.   I had the OMG French toast. It was dessert for breakfast: French toast with mascarpone, caramel sauce, and strawberries. My dining partner had the breakfast pot pie - it looked delicious.   Our coffee cups were always full. Our server was attentive but not overbearing.  I may not be back on the weekend because of how busy it gets, but I'll be back.

My friend and I stopped to get a beverage while we were walking around TMP. He got the berry banana smoothie - nothing special, what I make at home is better. I got "the buzz" juice - carrot, orange, lemon, and ginger - pretty good, but not worth paying $6.40 for it. While we were waiting for our drinks, we remarked how clean the place smelled and concluded that the place smelled like a combination of bleach and parsley.   Overall, it's not a bad place, but probably not worth going back.
