Great chicken burrito.  Store bought chips and possibly salsa too.  That was disappointing.  But go here for the chicken.  I'll definitely try a whole chicken (or two) to go next time.  Go early to avoid sketchy street parking.

Second time to Rita's.  The best Mexican food in the valley.  Great mix of real Mexican style recipes (the seafood) sonoran/southwest style favorites, and even fajitas (which I haven't had yet but given lack of good fajitas in az I bet these will be great.   The Chile rellenos I had today was the best I have ever had.

Great NY style pizza.  Double peperroni extra cheese and extra crispy is the way to go.  Not everyone knows the extra ceispyr trick (or likes crust that way) but lots of new yorkers like it that way and I have to agree.  The wings are average, but the special cheap.  So the 5 star rating is based on pizza alone.

Disappointing.  16 bucks for a sandwich and hummous is too much.  The lamb wrap was very light on lamb (maybe I'd get a bite every 3 bites).  The meat lacked flavor.  And when she delivers the hummus all surprised (as in you got the hummus too?) I later realized its because the sandwich came with fries.  Not exactly "healthy" as their healthy grill mantra states, nor was it on the big picture menu (showed it surrounded by grilled tomatoes).  Won't be coming back.

I just discovered this restaurant off of 27th Street and Broadway, half a mile from my office.  I will be a regular.  The food is VERY good.  I had the complimentary lemon grass soup, thai egg rolls, and green curry (with chicken).  All were very well prepared, great portion sizes, and spiced perfectly (I requested spice level 4 out of 5).  I also like that they offer brown rice - great for the carb conscious.  If you also work around the Broadway and 32nd Street area and have been disappointed for years by the lack of quality restaurants in the area do yourself a favor and try Chanpen Thai.  The dining area is a bit small/limited in seating, so if going with a larger party for lunch try to get there early.  They also deliver.

It's hard to add much more than what is already written for this restaurant, which properly backs up the high 4+ star rating (as of this review).   The owner/chef definitely cares about his food, the quality is high, the recipes amazing (the best roasted eggplant I had ever had) and the food a darn good value.     Although I won't deduct any stars because from a food standpoint it was so good, I would suggest the following:  1.  Great concept - and well explained on the website, but the limited chalkboard menu above the food line doesn't make it abundantly clear what your options are (such as an extra veggie costing more - and if so, how much?  2.  Consider a side of hummous w/out the meat/fill-in or falaffel.  Maybe a small side to accompany a pita for 2 bucks or so.  The regular hummous I tried was amazing.  I'd gladly order a pita and then add a side to that order.  3.  Expand to the west side!  This is a great restaurant and concept - I passed by as I work not too far, but won't forever.  I will definitely miss this place when that day comes.

In a desert of Chicago style gyros shops valley wide ive been looking for that oasis serving more authentic middle eastern style food.  At Shwarma King ive finally found it on the west side.  The more authentic style toasted sandwiches are excellent (and certainly more elegantly chowed down than a giant overflowing pita).  The hummous was perfectly spiced.  Not too much cumin as some shops do.  Not too peanutty flavored as some can be.  But perfect.  The lemon shining through but not overwhelming.  And the Falafel!  Best ive ever had.  As a valley native who misses the old Urban Cafe in Tempe, this place finally offers up a Middle Eastern style meal I will drive out of the way for.  Well done, and thanks to the owners who couldn't have been any nicer to a couple looking for a late meal (15 minutes before closing).  I can't wait to come back.
