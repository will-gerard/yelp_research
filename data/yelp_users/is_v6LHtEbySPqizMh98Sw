I'm not a frequent visitor at Magnum's, but I have definitely enjoyed my time here. It is a great place to visit with a few friends for drinks and cigars. If you're looking for a very relaxed environment, then this is the place for you. Take your time, and ask the employees what they would recommend - they know their stuff! Since I'm not a huge cigar guy, I made sure to let the guys know what I typically like, so they picked out the perfect cigar for me. Don't be intimidated by their overly stacked bar. Look over the menu and ask your waiter what they recommend! This is the perfect place for a sweet guys night. Don't pass by this place without stopping in for a drink or nice cigar!

I am typically a huge fan of Zipps! I love coming here with friends to enjoy food, drinks, and sports. I have been to many BIG sporting events here. Unfortunately, tonight was a huge let down. Although a couple important games were on, we were seated immediately since many tables were available. For a table of 6, we were given 1 menu and no silverware/napkins. We started by ordering drinks and food immediately. Drinks took 15 minutes, which is somewhat understandable due to the the amount of people at the bar. However, food took 55 minutes to come to our table and we were rarely visited by a waitress. We ordered 3 appetizers, 2 slices of pizza, and a burger. Bringing out appetizers after almost an hour is unacceptable. Our checks were not split up after requesting multiple checks and we had to reiterate our orders to the waitress since it was not originally noted what each of us ordered. After speaking with the manager, he explained they were understaffed and offered an apology. We were also given a generous discount on each meal which we were more than thankful for. All in all, we will most likely pick a new spot for sporting events after tonight's experience.

I've been to every Culinary Dropout location, and this is one is definitely my favorite! The yard is a great touch to this location - especially when the weather is great. Today, we came for a Friday happy hour and had a great time! Our waitress, Izzy, provided great service and always made sure our drinks were full. She even was accommodating with moving us to a larger table when an extra friend joined us! The vibe is great for laid back, social people that are looking for a fun place to play games, eat great food, and hang at the bar. I recommend grabbing a drink and some food at the bar before heading over to the yard for a game of corn hole! Be careful on the weekends though, it can get super busy!! However, this place is definitely worth a wait.

This is probably one of my most favorite "dive bars". It is definitely rewarding of 5 stars. I've lived in the uptown Phoenix area for a few years and love visiting this bar for multiple reasons. The bartenders aren't only friendly, but they love finding the "perfect" drink for you. Also, expect plenty of free treats from them. Although this place is relatively small, you can always find somewhere to sit/stand (super friendly atmosphere)! Come here with a small group of friends and be prepared to play some card games - they have it all! If you're looking for a bomb dessert, make sure to check-in and get the free brownie. It's a Reese's cup on steroids! I also recommend trying one of the homemade grilled cheeses. Make sure to check out their happy hour one day! Great deals until 8!!

I've started to consider myself a regular at Sauce. Ever since this location opened down the street from my house, I can't stop going! If you're looking for pizza, pasta, salad, or a sandwich, you have to check this place out. The environment is friendly and very welcoming. Staff is also super great at waiting on you. This is a great place for lunch or a casual dinner. I'd also recommend it as a good "first date" spot. The portions are a good size for the amount of money you pay! A cool thing they have available is the wine on tap. Who doesn't like a good glass of wine with their Italian food? You also have to make sure to grab a homemade cookie at the register! Whether you're looking for a good sit down meal or a quick to-go order, this is a place you've got to try.
