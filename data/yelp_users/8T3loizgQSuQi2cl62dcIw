There's a lady named Mari who's too unfriendly for  customer service that has worked the past couple of times we have eaten here.

The people are great and so is the atmosphere. Order the sea food pocket and general yangs chicken! You won't regret it!

I've been here 3 times so far and they do a great job! The barbers themselves are good friendly people. They care about the work they do and the prices are reasonable.
