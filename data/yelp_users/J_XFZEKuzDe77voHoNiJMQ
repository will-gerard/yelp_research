The only good bagel shop in all of phoenix.  Closest to an east coast bagel shop that I could find. Healthy Beth wrap is pretty much all I eat, its good. Staff is amazing

Great work, great price, had some last second alterations more than once, and they get it done. Just read the reviews. People love this place.

Borne Customs was referred to me by a friend. After being introduced to Troy (the owner) and discussing the project I wanted.  I was extremely pleased and comfortable with Troy leading the charge on my new build. Super nice down to earth guy who is extremely detailed oriented, he exceeded my very picky and high expectations. I would occasionally stop by and was more than welcomed to see how the build was going. It was awesome to see the process and his team labor over every detail. Troy made the whole process a breeze. I can't say enough about Borne Customs.

Went here for my shoulder because I had surgery done  on my labrum. They are very friendly and give every client their full attention, and they won't let you slack off. You learn alot in terms of posture and proper movement while performing the exercises. It's great because if you do any type of sport or training their proper techniques transfer over easily. One piece of advice is to do their recommended exercises at home when ever you can. It helps out big time. I had to learn the hard way.

I was looking for a tundra for fairly long time. Town and country really helped me find the right one. When the right one came on their lot. The correct model and price, they called me to let me know. My favorite part is that I did not feel the typical high pressure sales tactics that I could not stand from other dealers. With all the online price comparisons I know I got an amazing deal. Its been 3 years and 50k miles later my car is still running strong so I know their mechanics did a great job checking over the car.

Heaven in my mouth. Best bagels in AZ, always fresh. I know bagels pretty well being from NJ. They actually have Taylor Ham... Mind blown. Now that I know this place exists I will be editing some reviews I left for other bagel shops because they have alot to live up to now.

Not sure what's holding me back from a five star review, maybe the feel of the lobby.... Felt hollow / desolate. I know that may be a petty thing to gripe about but i feel it leads to the overall feeling of the place upon entering. Maybe some music to fill the empty space?Food was great, staff was awesome (more so than AMC) and their sound system cranked. Much better from last time i went, about 2.5 yrs ago. Better lighting chairs and tables.

Awesome service, very knowledgeable. They installed an awesome grill that can take some serious abuse. They even fixed my fire pit. I believe they mainly work in scottsdale. The location on goggle shows different than on yelp. Any who, was very pleased and think other people should use them.

I have been very happy with them. Pretty thorough, quick and nice people. I like that they call all the time the day before they come out.

Updated my review from 4-5. Great place, staff is super friendly.  Every review is spot on, great place. Tip: TRY THEIR KEVLAR COFFEE, fairly sure one of the only coffee shops that do this. I just wish they had a tad more emphasis on food. Is probably the best coffee shop in the old town area due to the space itself and staff.

8 months no product. I have tried all forms of contact. My next step will be to go to the store ( which according to yelp is closed) I understand delays happen however not keeping honest open lines of communication is not very  acceptable. I will gladly change my review if I get my jeans. However judging from other reviews it seems I may end up disputing charges on my card.

No Stars, Direct All hate mail to Roman Acevedo the owner. I understand business fail however the entire time they were terrible to get a hold of & deceitful, not open and honest. They sent an order / fulfillment confirmation but never sent anything. At least be honest and send an email saying you messed up the biz went under so I know to dispute it with my credit card company. Im cool with the fact that it went under, just be honest about it. Seems they threw more money at their websites and marketing trying to keep money rolling in with out doing the WORK. Seems they wanted all the glam and glitz of running a biz however no balls to bust ass and get stuff done.

Try their chocolate milk shake... Its Fire. With the abundance of trendy fro-yo and gelato places Petersen's is a breath of fresh air, when your being smothered by trendy candy crush flavors and insain jaw breaker toppings from other places. We went here because it was a favorite hang out spot of my mother in-law who grew up in Chicago, which is where petersens is originally from. The new local in AZ got her stamp of approval and is easily one of my favorite good old fashioned ice cream shops. Their ice cream alone is amazing and tastes like its make with quality ingredients. Creamy and delicious, we will be repeat customers for sure.  UPDATE: Ordered an ice cream cake from here and it's amazing.

Great layout. In the evenings the building cast a great shadow on the patio, which Was Awesome! I'm not to sure why they recently put the maze of metal gates on the inside of their patio.  I think it just ruined the outside space. Great pizza
