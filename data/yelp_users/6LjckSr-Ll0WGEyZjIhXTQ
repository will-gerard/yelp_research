I've heard this place is delicious and has clean food which I do enjoy. Eating healthy has now becoming a part of my lifestyle. I was told this place was a sister company of another restaurant.  It's kinda hidden when we first pulled up next to a bicycle shop. They had a patio out front which was a nice option if you didn't want to eat inside. I didn't know what to expect before entering but when I entered the place, it seemed as if I was taken back in time. I was a little confused at what I've heard and the mental thought I already had, and the incorporation that was now in front of me. It was like an old, vintage, antique-ish, theme. (Maybe this shop is like those in Italy?) One side was to-go and other side was dine in with tables. It wasn't a busy lunch day but maybe half the tables were filled with people during this time. It was quiet, no music, and the sounds of your table neighbors.  I like this for the fact that you can actually talk and hear your lunch dates. The tables were already set with fork, knife, napkin, and menu. Presented a nice clean atmosphere.  They had a chalkboard up against the wall that noted the all the daily special, in this case lunch specials including meals and drinks. Our waitress was so kind to read and tell us the daily special. Looking through the menu, it wasn't so detailed with descriptions of what was inside each sandwhich or salad. Since it was a new place for me to try, I was all game for what the surprise would be. They had their sandwhich and salads and veggie soup in the front and drinks in the back. I heard their sandwhiches are pretty scrumptious but I was in the mood for eating like a rabbit, so I opted for a salad. I ended up getting the 2 wash ranch salad I believe is the name? As far as my date, he had the special pulled beef sandwhich and their square pieces of appetizer pizza. To my surprise my salad was loaded. It came with a piece of bread wrapped in brown paper that reminded me that you would wrap fish if you were to get from a market. The salad had lots of dark mixed greens which had already been tossed in their dressing (delicious, but i cant figure out exactly what is in it!) and they had sliced one fresh tomato in half (which still had the vines on it) and a scoop of what looked like their version of chicken salad. Inside their chicken salad was tiny chops of chicken with red onion, celery, quinoa, and possibly minced parsely or basil? It was very delicous, light, refreshing, and made my tummy full and satisfied. Also, food came out quick. I think after ordering, it literally might have came out 7 min later. That was quite impressing. I would def recommend for people to try and I am definitely coming back for seconds another day, next time I'll try their sandwhiches.

I can't get enough of this place! Its worth the trip, sometimes 2 times a day even!! This place has delicious food! I usually get their pho but today i couldnt decide what to get, but after a preview, I tried their birds nest for the first time and omigod it hit the spot. Mixed veggies with pork, crab meat, whole shrimps sitting on top of deep fried noodles drizzled with the tastiest sauce; cant be beat anywhere else! Best in the west phoenix! Service is amazing. Walking through the door they greet you with warm hellos and smiles on their faces. I love coming here!

I have come many times here and it's never improved. Boy Oh boy are they slow! I'm actually writing this review right now in the drive thru lane. I wonder if being inside is just as slow.

I've heard a lot of good stuff about this shop and I can agree about what they all say! Dudes here are cool! These guys make you feel comfortable. Very helpful, especially for a picky juice vaper. Nice sized shop with tons of space. It's neat and clean with 2 big sectionals black leather couches to sit on and tons of gadgets and accessories for your mods. All display cases were line beautifully with stones and plants in which gave a nice theme in the shop. I was quite impressed.  Build station is personalized with stickers, which show personality! Juice bar, is nice, with a variety of all kinds of juices. Tons of different brands so you can stand and try for hours.  Having stools might play a better role. But my experience there was a good one. Thanks Manny! And Mr. Guy for the rewick.  Next Vegas trip, we'll be stopping by again.

Set an appointment with Kim, which I thought was the same gal that did my nails last time! I had a great experience before so of course I would continue to go back. Usually when I go to a different salon, they assume I would like a certain way and will do their way, and the end result usually leaves me dissatisfied. With my first set of acrylics at Lish, I asked her if she can do it the way I liked and what I wanted and she delivered with beautiful nails and even included, a fun conversation. I got an express pedi and with the 2 services, both completed, was under an hour! Quick service when I was on a time crunch with great results! Now I am back for my fill and another pedi! Since I forgot the first gals name, i was reminded by Kim that her name was Nancy!  Thank you Nancy for having one satisfied client and great at building client/customer rapport.  With this second time here for my nails (fill) with Kim; she is very precise and takes her time to make sure every nail is perfect. I like how she's focused and concentrates  on each nail.  I think she got both hang nails and ugly cuticle crud out!  Too be honest, it was a little early in the morning for me to get my nails done, having that I work a late shift and sleep even later, I wasn't in the mood to talk, and she didn't push the conversations, rather instead she put it all towards my nails! Thank you Kim! I def would recommend both ladies to any ladies out there wanting to get their nails done. Customer service here is excellent. When you first walk in, you are greeted by hellos, good morning, and bright early smiles from everyone and after signing in, asking if you want a bottle of water. And customer service doesn't stop there. While having your services, they ask if you need anything and making sure you're ok. This is one happy client! Thanks again Lish

I use to think when starving, anything would be tasty. Let's just say, it's ok. I've had better Banh mi sandwhiches. I got the classic banh mi (special meat with bbq meat, pickled daikon and carrots, cucumber, cilantro, jalapeno, and drizzled with a ooey sweet red sauce inside a french baguette)with a side of eggrolls (which comes in 3) and a taro boba. Their sandwhich had more pickled carrots and veggies then meat. Biting into it, there wasn't a balance of everything.   I tasted more of the veggies and baguette than then the meats. It was disappointing. The eggrolls was also a bummer. I thought I would be crunching into something delicious but instead it was a bite into mush. I couldn't quite put my finger on it but it looked and tasted like some veggie mashed with pork. I almost thought it was vegetarian eggrolls. Maybe it was? I am not quite sure what was in it because I had not read the description as I was just hungry and thinking....mmmm...eggrolls! But it wasn't an mmm reaction I got. I cant say anything horrible about my drink. The taro milk tea was nothing to special, just typical taro tea with boba. Boba wasn't fresh tasting, rubberish. I left not finishing my sandwhich and not satisfied.

I usually go to their first shop on 19th ave but since I live on this side of town, it's more convenient. Also working across the street helps me get things quick before work.  This shop has it all, from racks of juice, mods, and all vaping accessories. The staff here are professional yet cool as heck! They welcome you in like long time friends when you walk through the door! This is a gorgeous place with lots of space! Interior is very modern looking, with their signature colors: grey toned and white, and even their blue lights add that special touch.  Stainless steel seats in front of their stainless steel counter/juice bar. Comfort seating while I was trying out the juices. I love the music playing as well. This is a chill spot. Grabbed my juice before work and I can't wait to come back!
