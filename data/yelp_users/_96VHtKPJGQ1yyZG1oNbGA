Oh my god!  Stood and waited for over 25 minutes for a sales associate to assist me with speakers for my car...another associate called twice, yet no one came over to help me. I should have known better than to come here, it happens all of the time! A whole lot of blue shirts standing around, yet no one wants to help....I stopped on the way out, and explained my frustration and that the store just lost a sale! The guy at the door literally looked at me and shrugged his shoulders! I said to him, you don't even care! What a douchebag! Horrible service.... Horrible customer service!!!!

This is the third time we have dined here. The service is always great, but the quality of the food is seriously lacking. Tonight I ordered a 6 ounce steak, medium rare, with sweet potato and butter. When delivered, and cutting into my steak, it was beyond rare, cold and I could not eat it. The potato was cold as well, as the butter wouldn't even melt. When our server came by, I showed her the plate, and her response was, oh my god it's raw! She took the plate back to the kitchen, and brought a new plate a few minutes later. The steak was half the size of the first one, and it was still rare and cold. She stood there while I cut into it, and again stated that it was raw. She said that the kitchen was in a hurry and wanted to close early. I said please take it away, as I won't eat this.  It is not the servers fault. This is the LAST time we dine at Logan's. The couple across from us asked if our food was cold and raw, and I said yes. They stated that their dinner was cold and raw as well, and would not be back as well. Sorry Logan's, but you lost our business tonight, along with several other guests.

Went in for lunch last week. Our server introduced herself and stated that another gentleman would be her partner. He walked by our table 6 times and never stopped to see if we needed anything. We pushed out glasses to the edge of the table, in hopes that he would see we needed refills. Six times he passed us with the pitcher of iced tea and never stopped at our table. Our server only came by to drop off the check. We couldn't even get boxes to go. I was fuming mad, so I decided to wait to post this review, so that it wasn't an angry backlash. I have several hundred points with Chilis, and gave a friend the info, so she could use them, as I will never go into that Chilis again.
