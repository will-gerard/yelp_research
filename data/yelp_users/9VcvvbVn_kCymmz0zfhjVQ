Horrible customer service!!!! You can never find a manager if you need one! You have to have a stupid code just to go to the bathroom and then you have to find a staff member to give you the code which there are never any around --- good luck finding one! Horrible customer service! I was treated like I was an idiot because I didn't know a code existed and they quickly shouted out the code which was a combination of numbers and an asterisk at the end I had to ask again and was huffed at when I asked if they could repeat. Part of being in the grocery Industry is customer service! Horrible!!!!

My fianc√© proposed to me here last night and wow what amazing service! The entire staff went above and beyond! Thank you Judy in concierge for letting him sneak this past and help plan the night of my dreams! Thanks to the valet service for when we went to take our car to dinner and the tire was flat for changing our tire for us and even taking care of a ride to and from our evening plans! Room service was absolutely amazing and breakfast in bed was even better! Thank you for such amazing service for the best night of our lives!!!

Not even worth of a one star review! You don't have it posted anywhere that you charge gratuity, you charged gratuity and refused to take it off. Worst service I have ever experienced in my life!!! $17 sangria per glass and 2 drink minimum and I told the server I didn't want to drink anymore yet I was never told I could order soda. $34 I got the worst two sangrias of my life. Menu States a $1 up charge for sweet potato fries and you charged 2, and when I asked to change the charge the server got very upset. I will never return!!!
