I have been here numerous times. Every time "John" is there he finds a way to insult either myself or my wife. Dont get me wrong, I love their selection of books and other wares, its just "John" that turns me off of the place.

RIGHTS VIOLATION ALERT!  My wife had an appointment for a blood pregnancy test. We walk in for the appointment, and they refuse to do the test. Then they wouldn't allow me back there with her for her appointment. They  also forced her to recount events that happened several years ago, which threw her into a full-blown panic attack/PTSD attack. They still wouldn't allow me back there with her. So if you care about your loved ones at all, don't bother with this place.

I LOVE THIS DEALERSHIP! Every time we come in, they are fast and friendly. We are currently in the market for a new car, and they are happy to see us every time we come in with questions, or even just to say "HI". I would definitely recommend anyone who is looking into buying a ford to visit them, especially Jeff or Scott. Those two are great!

Great selection of products. She has Statues from various pagan faiths, plus a few fairies and dragons. Altar cloths, cloaks, skirts, runes, athames, incense. You name it, Jane probably has it! Not to mention she is knowledgeable and fun!

Great food for a great price! Where else can you get a good, filling breakfast for $2.99?

I have been a patient of Dr. Kline for going on a year. I have had nothing but good experiences with him. He helped me through a tough time, and I thank him for that. He is a wonderful Doctor. I couldn't have asked for better. I would definitely recommend him!
