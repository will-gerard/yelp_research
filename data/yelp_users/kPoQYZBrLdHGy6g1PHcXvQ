This resturant was absolutely delish!  We tried their shrimp cocktail that left my taste buds satisfied and had their seafood platter that had fried and grilled fish and shrimp,lobster etc plenty of tortillas and a a plate with rice and veggies.  They also had shrimp with fish rolled in bacon OMG.  My first time and it was great. Thy have a very impressive menu. The service was good and it was very clean.  I'll be back :)

Still HUNGRY.  Their sandwiches are such a disappointment we couldn't even finish...very little favor and gross fatty pieces and skin.  We did order Spring Rolls which were good with the peanut sauce.  The service was really slow, we got seated right away but it took several minutes to be offered anything to drink or order. We actually felt ignored most of the time.  Never came back to refill our water.   Our cousin order the PHO with meatballs and found it good but did not care much for the meatballs.  I wanted to like it...

I really enjoy coming here to get my nails done. They do a wonderful job on both pedis and nails. It is nice and clean inside. They are very friendly and welcoming. It is worth it to stop in and try it out.

We had the pleasure of meeting Andrea this weekend at a super bowl party and fortunate enough to have been given the opportunity to taste her yummy treats. We had her cup cakes, cookies and I absolutely LOVED her magic bars.  I will be sure to pay a visit to her bake shop to fulfill my magic bar cravings and see what else she has in store for my taste buds!

My first time visiting and am glad I stopped by. We had their Brussels sprout Nachos which are so great!  They have a handful of sauces to choose from for your tacos. We tried their shrimp and cod tacos both very flavorful. Their coconut rice was delish. The churro and soft serve ice cream were on point and their service was great.  I want to return maybe for their happy hour so I can get a taste of all their different tacos and have a coconut drink or ceviche, idk but am certain I will return very soon!
