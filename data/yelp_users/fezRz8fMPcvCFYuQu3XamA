One of the best places in town to get a New York Style Pastrami Sandwich. Every time I came into town from San Diego Miracle Mile  wound be the first place I eat at.

Nasty ......,  While the food server is making my Philly sandwich with gloves on he turns around and grabs a mop and starts mopping the floor then goes back to making my sandwich.  Just because you have gloves on doesn't mean you're okay with making peoples food after touching a mop. I just didn't eat the bread he had touched with the same gloves he touch the mop with. The employees need to be retrained on food handling skills.  I also asked a very simple question  "does the sandwich come with fries" the food server said yes. I get up to the cash register and she charges me for them. I ask her she says no they're extra. I guess they need to listening skills as well.   Never Again Will I eat here

The worst Persian food I ever ate. Hummus was tasteless. Gyro meat was that pre-sliced frozen meat you can buy at CostCo.  I won't be back. I have nothing more to say than stay away.  .......................................................................

DJ Tsunami.... Mixes music like a train wreck. The beats are off he either ends a song then starts up another or he completely destroys the mix. I don't know where they got him but he needs to go back.

I was going to try the place out, but after seeing the unappropriate political stickers of our President all over the place I decided to take my business elsewhere.  The owner of this establishment must remember he caters to the whole community not just a certain part of it. Yeah bumper stickers are funny but they also say a lot about a person.

Really they want to charge a $1.50 more to Substitute French Frys for a salad REALLY!  It costs them more for Frys  then it does for lettuce and Tomato. Every other Gyros place I've been to will substitute. NO LIE!    Good : they give a lot if gyros meat on gyros. Bad: it lacks tzatziki sauce and it's very oily Not impressed.

It was just Nasty!!! If you have no tastes buds then you might like it. I'm new to Phoenix and took a friend there for a quick bite. He ordered the egg foo yong which was cold.  Needless to say I was embarrassed for myself and for the restaurant. People say Oh they're great because they were on TV.  Yeah Diners, Drive Ins and DIVES.

Had a great pasta dish  ( chicken, broccoli, with mozzarella sauce) Actually very good.  Only complaint I could say was listening to the cook and his annoying whistling.

I wasn't impressed. The meat on the Philly was flavorless they nickel and dime you for mushrooms, peppers and onions. The cook had a problem with his spatula when he wasn't cooking he was banging on the grill making music which was very annoying.

Bluecorn enchiladas were fantastic. You pay for chips and salsa that are supposed to be made when ordered but mine weren't. Pricey but good.

Absolutely the slowest McDonald's on the planet.  It takes forever to get through the drive-through. I've done it three times, I will never go to that McDonald's again.

How could Fatburger even justify charging $12 for a half pound hamburger combo. I walked in looked at the menu and walked out. I'll give it another year before it's out of business

Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater. The shrimp on skewer was over cooked with no flavor and the Caribbean lobster tail had no favor what so ever. first time there and might just be the last.

Walk in to the counter girl didn't even acknowledge that I was there. She was to busy playing around with here cell phone texting. She was leaning against the counter facing my direction. I had to say HELLO to get her to put down her phone. Food isn't memorable and I'm sitting here right at the table in the restaurant writing this.

So far the best seafood I've had in Phoenix/Glendale. Had the the best Clam chowder and really good Mahi-Mahi grilled fish tacos. Went with a family member who had the fish and some Colossal Shrimp. The guy who took our order was very nice and came over to ask how the food was. I will be back!!!

First time eating here. Ordered the Pot Roast sandwich with a side Caesar salad and drink totaling $8.  I couldn't believe how tiny the sandwich was, looked like a kids meal or something off the 99 cent menu. It tasted ok but you could tell it was microwaved meat. Then the salad...... Opened it up took a look and noticed the lettuce was limp and wilted and the cherry tomatoes skin was wrinkled. I ended up throwing it out. Called the restaurant number on the receipt and complain to the manager who offered my money back. I told her I wasn't driving back to waste my time or money on their restaurant again. No wonder why the place always looks empty.  I won't be back.

Ordered the special Xlg pizza $20. Should've ordered Domino's would have tasted better. There was so much onion in it, it tasted like a onion pizza. Nasty

Had the Basil Chicken which was really good and flavorful. Tried the Thai Toast with spicy cucumber sauce, kinda like a crispy French toast. Waitress was very nice, place was clean with nice decor.  I'm usually the one that post negative reviews. I would be leery about some of these other negative reviews with these slanderous remarks.

Kevin the owner is the best very knowledgable and polite. He really knows his way around a head of hair. Gives the best head massages while washing your hair.

Great food Only one problem I don't like is that they put the silverware in a tin in the center of the tables. People cough, and talk over it which makes it not sanitary.

I really like this place but the drinks aren't very strong if you know what I mean. I'm a light weight when it comes to cocktails. I had a 7&7 and then a Long Island and felt a little buzz not much. The place is amazing inside the music needs a little work, DJ needs to pay more attention to the crowd and less to what he likes. But the DJ is a 10000 times better the DJ Tsunami at Charlie's who truly sucks.

They obviously don't know what a "Cheese Crisp" is  Keyword "Crisp" I saw them take a floor tortilla with some cheese in it and put it in the "microwave" This isn't even how you make a quesadilla.  They boxed it up and handed it to me and I told him it was a quesadilla not a cheese crisp.  The guy behind the counter told me they were the same thing only folded.  So I paid over $6 for a Cheese Crisp and got a $3 quesadilla.  I won't be back.
