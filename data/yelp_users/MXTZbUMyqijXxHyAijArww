My favorite neighborhood Thai food.   Beef salad, satay, green curry, yum! Food is great. Just a small family place. One cook and one server. Nothing fancy. Don't come for the decor, come to eat.  Country bar next door has live music at night, so you get a free concert through the wall.  Friendly, authentic, genuine and great food.

*UPDATE*  The country bar next door is out of business so no more loud crappy music! Bonus!

This was one of the worst meals ever.   We went because my wife received some giftcards from a patients family at the hospital she works at.   The service was lousy but the food was worse. Bland, uninspired and came cold to boot. They don't have garlic bread? I got a lame excuse for why. I grew up in NY. This is not italian food. A manger stopped by and asked how everything was and we said ok. All she had to do was look at our uneaten plates to know. I really didn't want to complain because I didn't want anything else from them. I just wanted to leave.   When we got home I realized that the nice people who had gone out of their way to give my wife a $100 gift card were just ripped off. I wrote to the company to let them know of my experience and have never heard back.    I have managed and worked at restaurants for over 25 years. I understand it's a tough job. Mistakes happen, but you should address them.   I usually don't complain, I just never go back. This was well beyond bad and the lack of follow up on a guests lousy experience speaks volumes. I will never darken the door of any of the OSI Restaurant Partners establishments (Outback, Fleming's, Roy's, Bonefish) if that's how they treat their guests.  Caveat emptor.

My son was taken there by his friends after breaking his wrist. He had his wrist reduced and they sent him home and told him to follow up with a doctor on Monday (his accident happened on Friday). My wife who is a nurse saw that he had an open fracture, meaning the bone had broken through the skin. She called over to the hospital she works at and the surgeon told her to bring or soon in right away, that he was at risk for infection and needed to be on IV antibiotics. We brought him in right away and he had surgery that day. Good thing we got a second opinion. I don't trust that hospital. I went to the ER there because it was close and they gave me some passion medicine for kidney stones and sent me home. When I went to my.doctor later that afternoon he admitted me to the hospital immediately with a perforated ureter. Good thing I followed up with my doctor our I would have been in real trouble. Avoid that place at all costs. I have given one star because zero stars is not an option.

If you need some delicious authentic Mexican food Pepe's is the place for you.  The Carnitas de Puerco, slow roasted pork in their delicious green sauce is out of this world. The Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole is fantastic too! It seems that if you close your eyes and point you will be rewarded with something incredibly yummy.  If you are tired of the same old chimichangas and the like head over to Pepe's for a taste of Mexico.

Great food, friendly family run business.  Benny makes the best tzatziki sauce in town.  I always get the souvlaki plate with their delicious rice and his wife remembers extra pita, extra sauce. My wife loves their gyros. Their chicken pita is great too. Everything is great.  Go there now.

Great pizza! As good as any pizza you will get anywhere in town. Cute old house with an inviting patio when it cools off. Had a wonderful meatball sandwich at lunch (they only do pizza at night). They have delicious crepes for desert.  If you want a great meal go to Cibo.

The food was great. I went on a Friday at lunchtime and the place was full. I had to wait about 10 minutes. It was totally worth it. I had the potstickers which were great. They tasted like they were made in house. I also had #23. h tiu x√†o thp cm / flat rice noodles with beef, pork, chicken & vegetables. It was similar to chow fun if you have had that before. The flavor was very good. The meat was tasty and all the veggies were fresh and crisp. The noodles were just right. Everything was well balanced. I have had the pho and spring rolls before and they were great as well. If you like asian food you should add Little Saigon into your rotation. It provides different flavors than Grand Dragon or Siamese Kitchen the Chinese and Thai restaurants I love on the west side. I can't wait to go back and try some other items.

This place is great. The papusas are fantastic and so are the banana leaf tamales. We had the sampler platter once to try some different things and everything was great. Service can be a tad slow so don't be in a hurry and your patience will be rewarded. Different flavors from Central America. Yay!

Saw the "Brooklyn Pizza" sign and being from there I had to stop and see if it was the real deal. Had a couple of slices and I'm in. Going back for some fresh pies and to try the Chicken Parmasean sub. Jonny, the owner is from Sheapshead Bay Brooklyn. Thanks for coming to the neighborhood,

Loved the food. We ordered off of the street taco menu. We had the pastor, conchinita pibil, chicken with pinon crema and pork Verde with cactus. Every taco was delicious. We  had a couple of skinny Margaritas, just tequilla, lime juice and agave . They were tasty. The food is upscale and so are the prices. Small two or three bite street tacos are $3 and up. Is it worth it? I would say yes. There are plenty of inexpensive taco shops if you want a huge $4 carne asada burrito and that has it's place. If you want an elevated Mexican food experience try this.

Great place! Obviously all the burgers are top notch. The Rehab burger is over a half pound of juicy deliciousness. You can also get a half size burger thst is still plenty big.  They cook the burgers the way you order them. Too many places ask how you want your burger cooked than completely ignore your choice. Plenty of non burger choices too, delicious salads, yummy sandwiches and wonderful pastas. Awesome milkshakes, fries, sweet potato tots and pig wings (just try it). Great drink specials and happy hour for the cocktail and beer drinkers. Last but not least is a friendly and knowledgeable staff eager to please. Run, don't walk over to Rehab today!

Went to Don's for the first time tonight. We got a x-large cheese pizza, chicken parm sandwich, meatball parm sandwich and chicken piccata dinner. Everything was delicious. It's a taste of New York. They are from Brooklyn, the best city in the world. Maybe I am biased because I am too. We tried a bunch of different dishes and each one was terrific. Can't wait to go back and try the Chicken Francese dinner, calzone, Chicken Alfredo and cheese cake. Welcome to the neighborhood!

Visited the store with my wife to check it out. It's a beautiful store with a cool vibe. All the products were laid out nicely. My wife loved the lingerie. Lots of cool sexy stuff. We had great service. Beth was very helpful and knowledgeable. This is definately our new place to shop. Head and shoulders above anywhere else in town. We'll be back!
