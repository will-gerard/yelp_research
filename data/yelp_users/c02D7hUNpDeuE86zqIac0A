Not too many good gun shops in the West Valley, however, I would NOT recommend guns plus. Management is very cocky and not helpful, every time I go in there customer service is the worst.  I will not go again.

Should have read the reviews, took my truck in for a quick wash and while waiting for a long time I noticed my truck was nowhere in sight. I had to ask around to located it. It was in the back because they drove it into a wall.  Now I have to keep going back so they can repair it and I still paid for the wash. They never offered anything to make it right.   Update; when I took my truck back to have them install part, manager apologized again and started on the right road to make things right.   After reading all the reviews I get a feeling that there is a serious customer service issue here, but I do know stuff happens and everyone deserves a second chance.   I recommend they get some serious help with training. I hope they can make lasting changes with customer service. Seeing around corners for their clients and be proactive not reactive when there is a problem.
