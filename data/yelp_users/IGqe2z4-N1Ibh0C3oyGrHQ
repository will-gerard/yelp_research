Love this place. Good food, fast service. Great staff. Take out is real fast. I am addicted to this wildcat omelette without potatoes. Good protein breakfast. Weekends tend to be crowded but never really long wait.

One the best restaurants around. Of course, since you are the chef, I encourage newbies to follow the instructions on the board for the sauces or you will be the only cook  you can blame for the bad experience. I have my favorite combination of sauces for the best taste. Occasionally a long line but, who wants to eat at a restaurant that no one likes?  A must eat

I have tried every other mongolian bbq in the valley and none compare to YC's. It is just plain better. Price is right for the portion. I pay extra for the box and go nutts at the line and take home the extra. Meat is always the best quality, the veggies are always fresh. Though busy at peak times, they always get you through the line quick.   YC's needs a seafood night with lobster and shrimp etc. I'd pay allot more a coupel times a month to step it up.  As for the frozen yogurt, don't bother. They need to pick up the brand Sweet Tomatoes uses and add a little fixin bar and I would pay the extra for dessert.

I hate giving this place two stars when the food was so good. Lasagna was great. Wings were amazing and big. But never came to refill drinks even once . Took 30 minutes just to take order. Not like it was packed. Just need to break down and hire some service staff. Whoever is in the kitchen did a great job.

She saved my life.   Ok, maybe that is a little overly dramatic, but pretty close to the truth. After getting out of the hospital for the third time in August last year, I went to my old friend Casey Grant for some help. She owned Fresh Start Wellness. My blood pressure was up, I was over 100lbs overweight, blood sugar up and I was battling an infection in my leg that was due to my lymphatic system shutting down. It would not respond to antibiotics. They call it metabolic syndrome. It was pretty clear, the grave was my only destination if I did not do something soon.   Casey did this zyto scan and it identified what was stressing my body and what kind of supplements would help me. When you are sick, you just cannot get motivated to do anything about being overweight. I started taking the supplements and followed her nutritional advice and within 30 days I had dropped 20lbs and I never felt like I was dieting. Suddenly I had more energy to exercise. It started with walks a night and now I am in the gym 3 to 5 days a week and have never felt so strong.   My leg looks like new. I discovered I have ankles. I dropped almost 70lbs but still have about 40 to 50 more to go. I know it is a lifetime commitment and I have fallen off of the wagon before, but with Casey's support and follow up AND accountability I know I can do it this time.  Thank you Casey.

Had an old friends reunion from our old neighborhood in chandler. Sunday night , not too slow, not too busy, ordered a wine and bourbon at the bar while we waited for everyone to show up. Great prices and decent selection. Seated us quickly, great variety on the menu. The pretzel appetizer easy die for. The calamari was also great. Mozzarella sticks were great, but the marinara was "different " great variety of menu choices one of our party had the salmon while another had a burger and fries. Across the spectrum was great food and service. Definitely going to make this a regular stop.

I contacted Erik about a year ago. I had reached a point in my health that I had already been in the hospital three times. I was suffering from issues very much related to my diet and weight. I have used many different protein shakes and meal replacement shakes and frankly, they all tasted bad. This was the first meal replacement that tasted amazingly good. Almost like cheating. It was easy to fit in two replacement shakes a day to help me with the change in my diet. I have lost a net of 50lbs and have another 50lbs to go and will definitely use this product.
