I LOVE this neighborhood restaurant. The best sushi roll on the menu is the Thai Tuna Roll. It's delicious! My husbands go-to menu choice is the ribs. They are consistently amazing. Do yourself a favor and order the red cabbage and goat cheese as one of your side dishes. This seasonal favorite is available in the winter only.

I truly love Postino Arcadia! I visit this spot often to enjoy their gorgeous patio. The food is consistently good and you can choose from a delicious variety. My favorite bruschetta pieces are the prosciutto, fig and jam, the ricotta with dates and pistachio and the goat cheese and peppers. Delicious! If the mood is striking in the direction of a salad, go for the chicken walnut salad. It doesn't disappoint! Happy hour is daily from 11-5pm with $5 glasses of wine. Tuesday nights you can get a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20. This is a great deal! Cheers!

This is a good patio spot in Scottsdale. The fig and ginger mule is a great take on a moscow mule; spicy and refreshing. The corn flatbread and beet salad are my top two food choices on the menu. I would say the only downside to this restaurant is happy hour is only offered in the bar and lounge. If you go to dinner early, unfortunately this great happy hour menu can't be enjoyed. Be sure you make reservations!

I have never experienced such a rude staff! First, the wait was pretty long on the Sunday morning we visited this restaurant, as to be expected, so my sister decided to grab some coffee as we waited. When she asked a server if the restaurant could make caffe latte's, she was told she should go to Starbucks for those things. Interesting response. I then asked if we could add an additional chair to our table of five, and they looked at me as if I should leave because that might be too much work. I ended up finding my own chair when nobody was willing to help me. Last, to top things off, we actually watched the manager of the restaurant ask two women sitting at a table next to us to leave because he had people waiting outside to eat! They hadn't even finished their meals!! I will never return to such poor service and overrated food.

My girlfriend and I recently celebrated our birthdays at Bourbon Steak with our husbands. The staff was knowledgable, friendly, and professional. The sommelier picked out some fabulous wines which paired beautifully with our meals. The tuna tartare is a must eat on the appetizer list. My husband I split a sirloin and the king crab with bearnaise. The sirloin was cooked to perfection, however I probably would not order the kind crab with bearnaise again. Bourbon Steak is the perfect place for a celebratory meal, especially during the holidays. The Fairmont Princess does a beautiful job with their holiday lights, however enjoy the lights prior to dinner as they turn off at 9pm.

Best brunch in AZ! The buffet spread is delicious and you certainly get your monies worth. Served is everything from crab legs to cheese to omelets to quesadillas. Mimosas are included and you can't beat the gorgeous views!

We really enjoy sitting on the patio listening to the live music on Friday and Saturday nights. The patio is dog friendly which we love! This is a great place for a burger and a glass of wine.

Lisa's Rum cakes does a fabulous job with each of their cakes. We ordered the Funfetti cake for my sisters bridal shower and it was a hit! They did a gorgeous job decorating the cake based on my directions. I highly recommend their cakes for any occasion!

This is the best culinary event in Phoenix! The food and wine vendors are some of my favorites in the valley. The event does a fabulous job with the space, shade and the number of people they allow in to the event. I highly recommend you buy your tickets the day they go on sale as this event sells out fast!

Love this restaurant! Five stars for service and atmosphere. The burrata and PB&J appetizers are both delicious. If you are to choose just one, I would go with the burrata. I ordered the chilean sea bass and it was cooked to perfection.  The corn creme brûlée was sensational and the roasted brussels sprouts were delicious. The ambiance by the pool is fun and relaxing. This restaurant is worth the price if you are in north scottsdale.

This is a delicious Arcadia restaurant. I seem to gravitate towards the truffle garlic bread and  the seasonal vegetable salad with arugula instead of kale. Add salmon to the salad for a bit a protein. For dessert, the salted caramel bundino is a must try treat! Other delicious dinner options include the ricotta gnocchi and the spaghetti and meatballs. If you join between 3-5pm, enjoy happy hour pricing of $5 glasses of wine and select appetizers.

O.H.S.O is a great place for a beer and good food. We most enjoy visiting O.H.S.O on Saturday and Sunday mornings as we can bring our dog and enjoy a mimosa and breakfast for $10 per person. This dog friendly restaurant offers easy access from the canal, homemade treats for your pup and a water bowel station so your furry friend never gets thirsty.

I have been seeing Tiffany, at fresh skins solutions, for almost 8 months. I LOVE the care she has given to my skin! I have seen dramatic improvements in the tone and brightness of my face. With options of microdermabrasion, facial and peels, Tiffany does a wonderful job determining what is best for your skin at the moment. I highly recommend Tiffany and fresh skin solutions!

I LOVE this restaurant! You can't go wrong whether you sit in the bar area or in the main restaurant. The dishes are culinary treats! The best meal ordered was the pork belly with polenta. So good. I'm still dreaming of that dish. The gimlet cocktail was my favorite of the ones ordered at our table. You can't go wrong with this chic, cute restaurant.

Rehab burger is a great place for a burger and wings in Old Town Scottsdale. The patio is small but on a beautiful day is a great place to enjoy a drink. We typically order the Gold Medal Wings and the BYOB. This is the perfect place to eat prior to a spring training game. Enjoy!

I recently broke my arm and I have not been able to style my own hair for close to 3 months. Drybar saved me! The location is fabulous and the staff is wonderful. I have been paired with most of the stylists and I haven't once been disappointed. I highly recommend this fantastic business.

Tucker was an excellent real estate agent to work with while my husband and I were searching for a home. He was attentive, detailed and informed. I would recommend him to anyone looking for an agent who excels in customer service and knowledge of the business.

I have been taking Pilates with the owner of this business for the last year. Billie is well educated, smart and informed. After just a few sessions with Billie, I have noticed a change in my tone and strength that I have not received with any other instructor. I would highly recommend Studio B Pilates to any person interested in changing how they feel and look!

My husband and I often come here to enjoy happy hour and maybe get something to eat. This is a great place to watch any game as TV's flank most of the restaurant. I often get the chicken sandwich without a bun and a salad. My husband enjoys the classic buffalo grilled drummettes  with ranch as the dipping sauce. We like to sit at the bar and we have always received excellent customer service. We will continue to visit this restaurant.

Ok...I seriously LOVE this restaurant. The food is delicious and the service is good. Unfortunately, I can't stand the chairs! The chairs are super uncomfortable and leave marks on your legs if you are wearing shorts or a dress. My husband and I still order take out from Hula's, but we won't eat at the restaurant.

This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. The menu is well thought out and the food is consistently good. The burrata appetizer is not to be missed. The short rib entree is a great dish. Enjoy!

Love this book store! I love the smell and feel of real books. Authors regularly have events at this store to read their new editions to the public. Visit Southern Rail restaurant before or after for a great meal!

You have to check out The Upton! My sisters and I came for dinner and we loved it. Great service and excellent food. My favorite appetizers were the ribs and the burrata. Order both. You won't be disappointed. For dinner we ordered the fried picnic chicken. So good! For dessert, try the smores. This fabulous new restaurant nestled in old town Scottsdale is a must try! Don't be surprised if this spot becomes your favorite neighborhood go to!

The moonjito was delicious! The serving staff is rather young. Our service was slow and at times, non existent. The food was just okay, but I think it had more to do with our server's poor attention our order rather than the food itself. We plan to return in a few months after the staff get their feet wet.

Buck &Rider is the new hot spot in Phoenix. My favorite menu items include the crab and macadamia sushi roll, the fresh pull apart dinner rolls, the Alaskan King crab legs and the pan seared scallops. Fresh fish and shellfish can be purchased to pick up for a delicious home-cooked meal. Sundays are a deal as they offer half off their bottles of wine and select sushi rolls. If it's a beautiful evening, you should sit on the patio. This is a must try seafood house!

Harkins Camelview has moved in to a brand new space. The lounge chairs, assigned seating, food and alcohol all make for a great movie experience. I would highly recommend checking this theater out!

Shake Shack is new to Scottsdale and so far it is a hit! The service is fast and the restaurant is great for kids. I ordered the Shackburger and cheese fries. Both were decent and reasonably priced. The best menu item I tried was the DustDevil Concrete. So good! Wine can be ordered by the glass or the half bottle. This place should be tried at least once!

We visited this restaurant for brunch on a Saturday. I ordered the avocado toast which was somewhat bland. However, a girlfriend of mine ordered the fried green tomato benedict which was amazing! I would absolutely return and try a different dish.
