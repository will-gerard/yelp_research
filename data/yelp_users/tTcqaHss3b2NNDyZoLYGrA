Go see my girl Katie at Grooming Humans.  She gave me a fun short shag...and gave me a great color job.    Next time I am in I need to grab a stack of cards because I am constantly being inquired about where I get my hair done....and I totally love to brag that it was at Grooming Humans.

I have been shopping at Fresh and Easy for years....so when I found out there was a F&E near my new job, I was super excited because I could run there for lunch, if I was low on stuff in the office OR shop there on the way home after hours.  On my first visit, I was mid-process of checking out and decided to pay with cash.  My  first $20 goes in no problem...the second one got stuck in the shoot and ended up ripping so the feeder would no longer take it.  I politely waved over the cashier and asked if she could help with the issue.    She walked away with my wounded bill, for what I assumed was to get a crisp $20...No.  She tapes the bill together on both sides.   As she hands it back to me she hovers over me and watches me attempt once to have issues inserting it into the bill feeder.  Which was unsuccessful.  She then reaches over my shoulder and starts rubbing the paper of the bill between her fingers and CLEARLY and DIRECTLY  asks me "Where did you get this?  This doesn't' feel like REAL money."    (AFTER she spent time with it TAPING it back together)  Now, I was cashier in college, so I know how to identify a counterfeit.  So I raise the bill to the light and see there is a money strip within it, and I took the time to show her.  She simply scoffed at me, kept insisting the weight of the paper wasn't right to be REAL money, and then goes to the monitor and forces it back to pay with a card and then walks away.    So I force the screen back to paying with cash and get the bill in the feeder on my second try.  I take my receipt and start to walk out...and she stops me and asks me "Did you pay for that, how did you get it to work?" Forcing me to open my hands to PROVE my receipt.  Guess what, Chandler F&E? -- I will NEVER return to your establishment.

I had a last minute project for a friend's Halloween costume.  I called them up asked them about solutions and there was no issue or rush charge.  I was able to get a custom made mug in two days.    I totally saved the day with Brand X's help!  Muchos Gracias!

As a Latina, I have to say its soooo Mexican in there....glitter murals of Pancho Villa and Frida Kahlo paired with Jaguars and Mayan Temples -- and nothing by salsa musica on the overhead speaker.  I highly approve!    HUUUUGE burritos!...make sure to try the wet ones (enchilada style) --  the sauce is homemade and perfectly spicy.    The cooks are amazingly considerate...asking about your preferences and giving your recommendations.    Great Horchata as well!

Record fast move! I will never move myself AGAIN. Never ever. If you need movers use Bulwark Moving! My guys were happy, friendly and awesomely courteous...even with a second floor move and in 111* heat. Ask for Big Mike and Armondo, awesome -- and kick-a$$ fast -- set of guys!

Sometimes when you go out, you can really good good, but lack luster service...and when this was true of the previous owners. But today, the interior is beautifully updated, the services is wonderfully friendly, and the good is just as awesome, if not better. Great buffet and lunch specials...and the owner comes out to give you recommendations and specials personally. It's tucked away, but a jewel in this strip mall.
