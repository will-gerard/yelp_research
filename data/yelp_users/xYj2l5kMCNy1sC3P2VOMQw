THE FOOD IS AWFUL.   Things ordered: - fried pork wontons. Over fried and greasy. The pork was flavorful, but the grease kind of undercut it and made it not great.  - tofu chow mein. To me, chow mein means fried noodles. I got lo mein. And the tofu was cold in the middle. I realize that working with soft tofu is difficult, but that shouldn't mean that you add it in last, leave it to cook for a minute and serve it when it's still cold. - lemon chicken. Fianc√© got this. Apparently it was typical fried lemon chicken. Can't really go wrong.   They also charge you for rice. $1.50 for steamed rice, $5.50 for a small fried rice and $7.50 for a large fried rice. Maybe it's just because it's Vegas pricing, but it's a little ridiculous.

There's this thing that Asian people usually do when looking for a good Asian restaurant, and that's to look for other Asians eating there. At least, that's what my fiance and I did when we were looking for a place to eat. We were bleeding money in Vegas (like everyone else) and wanted to find a place that had decent prices for decent food on the Strip. So we ended up at Noodle Asia.  The prices are slightly higher than what we would pay in Chinatown Houston, at least for what we ordered. We got flat rice noodles with beef and Chinese sausage fried rice. Both pretty tasty in their own right. However, some of the other things on the menu were priced ridiculously.   I would come back again if I felt like I spent too much money the day before, especially if I just wanted to stay on the Strip. Also, being in the Venetian helps since it was by far my favorite hotel/casino.

I was so disappointed by this restaurant! With such fabulous Yelp reviews and my love for Hubert Keller, I was expecting so much more.  Maybe it's because I'm from Texas, but when my fiance ordered a pulled pork sandwich, and the pork was anything but pulled (it was cubed), we were apprehensive about what else can come. Also, the way they served the food was so counterproductive. The best thing about lunch was the fries, and they were so obviously frozen. Not that that's a bad thing, it's just I expected so much more. I guess with the direction food is going, I thought that they would be hand cut.  I got a chicken sandwich. It was pretty good, but just kept getting worse as I continued eating since the sandwich kept getting more and more soggy.   I wouldn't come back. They need to find a new chef, or at least change the menu to fit the restaurant theme. With a name like Fleur, "Spanish" pulled pork sandwiches and boring chicken sandwiches just aren't sticking to the theme.

This was the absolute best meal I had in Vegas. I was a little apprehensive because we walked in, and there weren't very many guests. I expected more people there because it's a Mario Batali/Joe Bastianich restaurant, and we were in Vegas, and so I made reservations. Turns out, they were completely unnecessary.  First thing that came to our table: chickpea bruchetta. This was amazeballs. It was so good. Seasoned and perfectly cooked chickpeas with basil on toasted bread. I was surprised at how good it was because I'm usually not a fan of chickpeas.   I got the lamb and rapini (broccoli rabe) oricchette. I found it to be a little salty, but nothing I couldn't overcome. Of course I took the "chef recommendations" and added whatever they told me to.   For dessert, I got the lemon budino. It's basically a lemon souffle, for anyone who doesn't know what a budino is. I had to google it before I ordered. I didn't think it was very good.. It was too tart for me, and the honey didn't really help. Maybe I was already overstuffed from all the deliciousness that I had been eating previously. Dessert also came with a complementary nine bites. Unfortunately, due to my chocolate allergy, half of them were inedible, and the other half I assumed were contaminated by just being in the same bowl or storage unit as all the others.   Even though dessert seemed disappointing, I'm not deducting a star. Why? Because the service was completely amazing. Everyone working was so helpful, so kind, and so attentive. My fiance dropped his napkin on the floor while heading to the bathroom, and by the time he came back it was replaced. We ordered a bottle of wine, and the sommelier was very knowledgeable about the wine we got, and attentive enough to notice that we weren't there to spend more than $50 on a bottle. I've tried to find the wine we got there, just to have in our wine rack as a commemorative bottle or two, but unfortunately I've been unable to find it at our local Specs.   The next time I'm in Vegas, I'll either make it a point to come to this restaurant again, or at least show up to a different B&B restaurant. Such as Carnevino. But this was so good that I might be back without any questions. Maybe I'll just go to both.

Another free thing to do in Vegas. Another thing to take your breath away in the Bellagio. Apparently the conservatory changes by season, so you should definitely go every season to see what beauty they'll come up with. If I could have a conservatory like this in my house, I definitely would. Just imagine the work that it takes to maintain all these flowers!  If you walk to the gift store, you can find some pretty shot glasses/glassware to take home as souvenirs for family and friends, granted it's a little expensive. I think it was $12/shot glass. But, since you're in Vegas, and you're bleeding away all your money anyways, you may as well.

I only saw this at night, but it was so beautiful. Everyone should stop by and see the fountains, even if you've been to Vegas multiple times. Every time I end up in Vegas, I'm going to make it a point to see. At night, at least during a busy weekend, the fountains will go off every 5 or 10 minutes. So, if you don't get a good spot the first time, just hang around and when everyone is leaving, find a good spot to view the next show.   The fountains paired with classical or operatic music is definitely much more beautiful than when it's paired with modern music. Singin' in the Rain or a Michael Jackson song just doesn't feel right with the elegance of the fountains. If there was a night where they just did classical songs to the fountains, I would stay for hours.

THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE NIGHTCLUB.  I had so much fun! If you buy presale tickets, cover isn't too bad. I think it was $50 for guys and $20 for girls. Alcohol also wasn't too expensive, I think it was $15 for the majority of drinks. We found a really personable bartender that is originally from Texas and he made our drinks really well.  The club does get really crowded, and if you want to be on the floor where the DJ is that's not going to happen unless you get there early and stay there. Not being on the floor doesn't matter though, because you can hear the music and everyone is still mingling/dancing where the pools are.  Also, I think my fiance was impressed by some of the things I heard from guys trying to hit on me. "How can you text me if you don't have my number?" "This is my friend Mike. Sometimes we call him Magic Mike" "My abs get better as the night goes on" "Is that your smile on the floor? ... OH THERE IT IS!"  If we go back to Vegas, we'll definitely come back if it's still as good as it was this past weekend.  A lot of girls are complaining about the number of stairs. I didn't think it was that bad. Maybe the girls complaining just aren't used to walking up/down stairs.

So you're in Vegas, and you've been to all the buffets, and you're feeling the burn in  your wallet. Enter Twin Peaks. A typical chain restaurant that as you look over the prices you feel of wave of relief pass over you because the typical chain restaurant has the typical chain prices.   The food is meh. I mean, it's a Twin Peaks. I didn't expect it to be amazing, and it wasn't terrible. I probably wouldn't come back for the food. I would come back just for the experience and the fact that it doesn't hurt to pay the prices.  I got a margarita. It was strong, and it was delicious.  Our waitress decided to flirt with our friend, and we decided to pressure him into competing against her on the rock wall. And yes, he did get his butt kicked pretty badly. But it was worth all the additional tip we gave our waitress.

OH MY GOSH. Bacchanal is so delicious.  If you're going to go on a Vegas buffet binge, don't start here or else you'll just be disappointed by all the others. The buffet is massive. MASSIVE. And pretty much everything I ate was delicious.   I wasn't a fan of the truffle scalloped potatoes since the truffle oil was a little overwhelming. The korean short ribs were delicious. You can make your own crepes. The vanilla fleur de sel gelato was yummy.   I could keep going on and on and on about everything I ate, but the rule that we followed for Bacchanal was, "Eat until you can't eat any longer. Then take a breath, and do it again."  We didn't eat again for the rest of the night. #winning

I was disappointed in this restaurant. I realize that it's pub food, but still. I think that, like everyone has said, Gordon Ramsay needs to come back and whip the ex Hell's Kitchen winner back into shape.   We made a reservation for 1 pm and we wound up missing one of our people. We told our waiter that we were just going to order/eat without him, and it took so long for him to take our orders.   My fiance liked the bangers and mash, the fish and chips were a little sour tasting (weird). If you go, you should order the duck poutine, that was the best thing!

I got a recommendation to come here from the hotel I was staying at because the margaritas are supposed to be good. So, during a break from the conference I was attending, my friend and I came here for happy hour.   I got my typical margarita - mixed berry. It was pretty strong but still really tasty.   Our bartender recommended we get the dips to snack on as we chatted and drank our margaritas. The queso and the bean dip were both really good, and my friend really enjoyed the guac (which I'm not a huge fan of in general).   If I wind up back in this area, I'd definitely try out this place again on the sole fact they can make a solid margarita.
