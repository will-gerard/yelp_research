Frank Reach is not only the.best in the business but also very caring about his patients, ive been going to him on and off since I was pregnant with my oldest daughter 14 now. He has helped every physical pain ive had including a car accident.

I go past several cheaper Hardware stores to go to Arties. 2 reasons  CUSTOMER SERVICE and they get you in and out your not wondering for days trying to find something and parking a block away! Instantly your greeted and escorted to the area and get what you need. Always friendly and like I said the customer service is worth the trip! Bonus if you want to wander they have everything you never new you needed and more:)

12 hour happy hour rocks! Their Nutella coffees and new mexico burritos and awesome. Come back for lunch and have their cobb salad and soup of the day. Their 4 to 6 munchies are amazing the bruchettas are perfect with a variety of $5.00 glasses of wine. Dinners of the night are for people who really love  good food. The patio is perfect this time.of year. Also their free WiFi is icing on the cake!!

I had trusted this repair shop 3 times I had been hit. My own insurance  company  USAA  had a rep  in the shop I was dealing with. I just went  to sell my van and found out it had structural  damage that I was never told and the van should have been totaled. I just made at the auction  barely what the cost of the repairs were. On the last accident  on 06/11/2015. Stay far away from them. They seem great, I just learned a very costly lesson!!! I lost over $3000 on my vehicle
