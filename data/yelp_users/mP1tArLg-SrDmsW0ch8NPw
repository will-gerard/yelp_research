Horrible experience!  I traded in my 2010 Camero which they were to pay me for because I financed the new vehicle in full for the 0%.  Well they said they will mail me check in a few days for the car because they have to make sure there are no liens etc. I said sure ok.   Guess what...?  They never paid me for the car.... So a very long drawn out time consuming problem now!! Calling and emails... on and on...   Whats that old saying...'The checks in the mail'  Been 2 months!!! Lawsuit time!!!  I want to make clear that I had a good salesperson and this was not his fault. This is a management problem and mistake... A huge one that this place seems to have!

This is a great breakfast stop!  Gotta love the homemade biscuits... are you kidding me!  Awesome! CB is a huge chain but they do some great things.    The only thing is the way they have designed the space the servers are in the back a lot... too much.  They need to be on the floor more to make sure the cups stay filled up!

In house roasted beans!!!  First time last Friday night.  The espresso is great!  I enjoy high end beans like illy etc.  This place is cozy as well. Get a beer or wine or food and hang out.  Next time i gotta buy a bag a beans and see how it taste in my home machine...  Highly recommend!

I go here a lot.  Everyone there is friendly and remember me and my drink that I order.  It really don't get any better!  This place can get busy with a long line at times...

This is a great Starbucks!  Huge patio on the east side in the shade. Some lounge seating inside.  Gotta stop for my espresso..

This is an upscale restaurant.  Always good service and great food!  We found this place from going to the Blue Martini and The Skinny Italian Kitchen next door.

This is a great place!  My first time in a couple weeks and loved it!  Reminds me of Matro's Steak House.  I think these guy were some of  the prior owners of Mastro's.    We had a table of four.  Crab bisque for the starter. The steaks were perfect. Crab cakes were great!  The Lobster Mac n cheese was good. The cream corn was great!  Service was very good!  He was attentive but not too much. Not aggressive, humble and friendly service.  Just how I like it!  The bar looked like a good place to hang out.  Highly recommend this place.

Great burgers!  Been there several times. Walk up and order then they deliver to your table.   They do a good job here.  A bit long to get your food sometimes but not bad.

Pizza is pretty good.. But everything else I have gotten is not so great!  A turkey sandwich with 2 thin slices of meat... Not nice!  Norterra location is good.  But this one has some work to do!  But plenty of draft beer just to hang at the bar!  Service is slow... 30 min for food at lunch is not cool!!  Nice job on the build out.  Nicest one yet!  I will keep going and see if it gets better...

Great fast casual.  I like the food. Friendly service here. Which is huge for me. Will be a regular stop for a gyro or a salad.
