Juan's is my all-time favorite Mexican food restaurant.  Usually we call ahead and pick it up because the lunch rush CAN be a  bit daunting, but for all of the business they do, they seem to handle it as well as possible.   the service is always friendly and the portions are huge and cheap.  the salsa is fantastic!  if you're in a hurry, i recommend ordering to go or going EARLY or LATE.

oregano's i'm so so so so sorry that i tend to overlook you.  never again.  i promise.    oregano's has never let me  down.  well, once, but it's because i forgot they used fresh parmesan.  so when they asked if we wanted parmesan, i said  "yes"  and then was mortified when instead of a shaker of powder, there was fresh parmesan sprinkled  all over my pizza.  i like fresh parmesan on my pasta, but for some reason  i think it ruins a pizza.  this is a personal thing, so i can't hold it  against them.  i absolutely love that oregano's makes the patio the focal  point of the restaurant.  even in the summer when it's deathly hot, they somehow manage to make the patio appealing.  the misters cool it down, but don't turn the patio into a swamp.     the last time we went i was STARVING after  a very very long day that i may or may not have complely forgotten to eat.  by the time we arrived, the wait was 30 min. for 2 people *sigh*.  (there had been a sign outside NYPD pizza boasting no wait and my belly was tempted).  "no" i reminded myself "oreganos always has a wait and it's  always worth it."   the host told us that we  could sit at the bar if there was room and just to let him know if we found a spot and wanted to stay there.  so we  went to the bar, but it was pretty busy and there weren't 2 seats together.  the bartender offered  to move another chair around and a very nice couple said they could move down.  the bartender then took care  of taking us off of the list, which was nice.  the word "hospitality" came to mind (what a novel idea in the industry....)  i eyeballed a margarita and my hungry thirsty belly did a little dance.  i never would have considered getting a margarita here, but i'm so very glad i did.  it was quite possibly one of the best margaritas i've ever had.   great beverage, check!  knowing full-well that the pizza would take a good 30-45 minutes to come out i knew i had  to have an appetizer.  the calamari is always good, but i wanted something else.  once again, i ventured out of my comfort zone and remembering that once upon a time someone had told me the toasted ravioli were good, ordered those.  oh.my.goodness!!! the cheese was sooooo soft.  it was  like liquid gold.  i forgot to share and actually ended up scarfing most of the ravioli down.  amazing appetizer, check!  then the pizza came and it was scrumptious! (as i have come to expect)  however, they forgot to put pepperoni on it. BUMMER!  and it's not like they can just fire another one up really quick.  however, the bartender went and got  us some pepperoni -- not the cold handful, here's your damn pepperoni, now you can't complain stuff, but they actually heated the pepperoni up and it was  a PLATEFULL, so it wasn't QUITE the same, but pretty darn close! fixing an order-gone-wrong, check! (although it would have  been an added bonus to have a manager address the problem  with the customer.  but that's just me.)  i want to give it 5 stars, but i just can't. not yet.  i need to have a few  more amazing experiences there and then i'll probably bump it up.

this chipotle is SUPER TINY!! and so the line can be a bit crowded.  there's plenty of room on the patio, but that doesn't work out so well in the middle of summer when you might as well just go sit on the sun.  i was SHOCKED at how efficient and friendly they were here.   i mean, i've come to expect quick  friendly service at Chipotle, but everyone seemed to actually really ENJOY working there.  nice! and of course the food was  fresh and delicious!  this is a great location if you're going to take out, but if you want to eat on premises i recommend NOT going to eat lunch at noonish.  go early or late if possible.

this is by far my favorite bar in the valley.  the beer is fabulous and they have a fantastic late night menu and drink specials. i love that i can order food until 1am.  we always sit at the bar and have great service, but i can't attest to the service in the rest of the restaurant.   the patio is a great spot to sit and people-watch and relax.

i haven't been here in ages, but i'm sure much hasn't changed.  whoever said that they are over-priced must be from somewhere else because there prices are definitely low to average.  which is why there hasn't been a single incident when i haven't witnessed a bunch of over-served d-bags.  it takes a LOT for a bar to make me feel uncomfortable, but this one succeeded.  there are some great people that hang out there, but there are enough shady ones that it's just not worth it.  there are too many other dive bars in the area to ever go back here.

i've been raised on macayo's so i maaaayyyy be a little biased, but i really enjoy their chips and salsa and anything they put the baja sauce on.  the enchiladas are also really good and the cheese crisp is (usually) perfect.  i've never had an issue with service at this location that was noticeable one way or another.  my favorite macayos is still the one on 19th ave and thunderbird, but this one is a close second.

a friend recommended Carl to us a few months back when i had some MAJOR car issues.  My engine was COMPLETELY shot and he checked out the rest of my car to make sure it'd be worth replacing.  It was and so he found me a used (but not as used as my original) engine and negotiated the price with the seller to keep my cost as low as possible.  He definitely DIDN'T overcharge me and has continued to make sure my car is in the best shape possible.  The staff is friendly and they have transportation available if you live close.

i haven't been to Carrabba's in years and i've missed it so much!  we went the other night and everything was fantastic!  there were a couple of hiccups early on, but nothing at all major.  the calamari was nice and crispy, but not overly-breaded.  i ordered the linguini pescatore (minus scallops) and while the sauce wasn't as spicy as i recalled, the shrimp was FANTASTIC!  normally i take the shrimp out of my dishes and donate them to the rest of the table but not this time.  succulent meaty delicious.   and the service was pretty fabulous, too!  i felt bad for our server because my uncle had her box EVERYTHING and the wee one kept trying to talk to her.  she handled everything graciously and never missed a beat.   we will definitely be back.  definitely the best italian restaurant at their price-point.

i hate to ding Sprouts, but customer service is a big deal to me.  i've never had any complaints... their cashiers are always professional and friendly and when employees are on the floor stocking they've always asked if i was finding everything okay.  But the deli department.... NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL!  i went in to order a run of the mill deli platter.... meat and cheese  and also a condiment platter.... sliced tomato, onions, lettuce.  i had looked at what several local grocers had to offer online and really liked Sprouts.  Not to mention that i want to support local business.  But when i got to the deli counter they didn't have listed what i was looking for.  when i mentioned what i wanted all i got from the guy behind the deli counter was his own list of complaints.  he told me that he's done catering (great, then cater to MEEEE, YOUR CUSTOMER) and that he thinks the order form is cheap looking and misses the full-color pamphlets they used to have (probably what i saw online).   he talked me into their mini-sandwiches after very condescendingly stating that they GENERALLY like 24 hours notice.  since i was giving them 32 hours notice i wasn't sure why he was acting like it was a problem.  i don't know why i didn't just leave then and take my business somewhere else.  i SHOULD have and i KNOW better than to deal with service like that.  But still, i hoped for the best.... even after he said that he hoped that they didn't get too many more orders (implying that they wouldn't be able to handle the volume since i SO INCONSIDERATELY gave them less than 24 hours notice. can this guy do math?).  so 32 hours later we picked up the sandwiches.  there was a mix of chicken salad, tuna salad, ham, turkey and roast beef.   every sandwich was built EXACTLY the same dollop of mayo, dollop of dijon mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, alfalfa sprouts and meat (no cheese).  dijon mustard on CHICKEN SALAD??!?!?!!  i think not.   i'm highly disappointed in the service given.  i  should have asked if they had meat and cheese and could they put them on a platter for me.  better yet, i should have gone elsewhere that was less convenient, but with better customer service.     i will continue to go to Sprouts for meats and veggies, but will never ever ever shop their deli again.

the little man wanted to check out the restaurant with pigs in the front.  i remember coming to this place years ago and not being very impressed, but decided to give it another shot after little-man brought it up for the umpteenth time.  the food was okay, but definitely not the best bbq ive ever had.  the service was okay but i felt like the food took too long for bbq.  apparently, little-man's food wasn't very impressive, either, because he hasn't asked and for a 4 yr old, he's quite the connoisseur.

i've been here several times now.  at first i wasn't sure how i felt about it.  it never seems to be very busy, but the service is always very polite and friendly.  the food i feel mixed about.  it's  GOOD.  the meat is always tender and the dishes are really flavorful, but i never really found anything that i LOVED.  and yet i continued wanting to go back and give it another try.  (the chips and salsa are really good -- and of course if you know me, you know that i like to mix the regular and the hot  for my perfect salsa).  nothing just really grabbed me.  their pork isn't shredded  like  i'm used to, they use pork loin which is good, but the consistency of it just doesn't seem to mix well with the food.  and the beef is super tender, but i just hadn't found my perfect mix of flavors yet.  until i tried the shrimp rellano.  so good!  i've been burned by rellanos in the past so i don't usually get them anymore.  this was the best rellano!  it was breaded perfectly (not too much like some places where the breading completely overwhelms the other flavors) and the cheese was super smooth and just oozed out.  delish!  and our server recommended something for the wee one that i didn't see on the kids  menu (i could have been totally blind) and he loved  it!  bonus!

Oh, Ajo Al's.  You have deleted items off of your menu and try as I may I cannot find anything that i like in what remains.  Add to that an extremely lackluster server on our last visit and it will be a VERY long time before i return.  It's the small stuff like checking back in a timely fashion and not just saying "i'll SEE if i can get that taken off for you" since i clearly only had two or three bites.  and then as you're halfway to the kitchen remember to come back and ask me if there's anything else i want.  Don't drop the check before asking if we want dessert.  We did, but we went out for frozen yogurt instead since you had already dropped the check off.

in general, red robin isn't fantastic.  it's a bunch of ingredients over-piled to make you forget that the meat is barely there.    however, my mom heard good things about it and wanted to check it out.  i'd never been to this location before and i won't be going back. it was slow when we arrived and we were sat right away, but despite asking for a high chair, never got one.  about 5 minutes later someone came up and i thought they were our server.  they said our server would be right over and didn't even take a drink order.  i asked if we could at least get a high chair and they brought one right over.  still no server, but there was a manager that walked by several times oblivious to the fact that we had been sitting there now nearly 10 minutes with a restless toddler and NO DRINKS!  even if a place is busy, waiting 10 minutes for a simple "what can i getcha to drink" is unacceptable, but there were MAYBE a total of 5 tables occupied.  we finally left, still without being properly greeted.  i was going to ask to speak to a manager at the host stand, but there was no one there and the manager was behind the bar, shooting the breeze with employees.  so i guessed that would have been a pointless move.    so, if you absolutely MUST have an over-garnished, under-meated burger, please please consider going to a different location.

i hate shopping.  i particularly hate shopping for shoes.  i don't need to be  hounded or asked a million times if i'm *still* finding everything okay.  if i need help, i will ask for it.  But i also hate it when i DO ask for another size and they seem all put-out.    there is the perfect balance of helpfulness minus the pushiness at this shop.   while i was asked a few times if i was finding everything okay, it was never by the same person and always ended at that.  additionally i saw them assisting a handful of customers and informing them of their sale. (it's currently buy one, get one 1/2 off).  again, here's where i always feel pressure. "you know if you buy another pair...."  (as if i can't read any one of the gajillion posted signs...)  they were super-polite and just told me that if i came back with my voucher, i could still get the 1/2 off.   the next time i need shoes, this will be the first (and probably only) stop.

RIP OFF!  RIP OFF!!   I had my oil changed there out of convenience one day and they told me all sorts of stuff that i needed in addition and told me that they'd give me a discount if i did it that day.  i later took my car to my mechanic (which i should have done in the first place, but i needed a car wash, too...) and there was absolutely NOTHING that needed to be done.    The attached gas station is awful as well.  many times the credit card machine at the pumps don't work so you have to go inside where the service is the slowest i've ever seen in my life.  not to mention that sometimes they lock the beer coolers during the late-afternoon rush which would be okay if i could get some SERVICE, but they apparently don't know the meaning of the word.     The people who repair/replace glass in the auto-spa are CONSTANTLY bugging the customers at the gas station.  It's very annoying.  despite the convenience i will NEVER get gas there or step foot inside again.

HTC is fantastic! i had my belly-button piercing re-done there years and years and years ago at the Tempe location and was super-impressed with their professionalism, knowledge and cleanliness.    Recently i decided it was time to re-pierce my ears.  Somewhere along the way i got lazy and the holes have been closed for at least 5 years.  Ever since my 1st experience with HTC i knew that i would never ever ever let a piercing gun anywhere near my ears ever again.  But now that i live in Glendale i REALLY didn't want to drive all the way to tempe just to get my ears done.   And then i discovered there was a shop in Phoenix.  i literally turned my car around and went straight there.  When i walked in they were friendly and helpful (as always).  They asked all the right questions to make sure everything was exactly what i wanted.  Sure, it's going to cost more than a lot of places, but the quality and the service is WELL worth it.  "You get what you pay for" isn't always true, but in this case, it is.

I've been hearing about this place for years, but never ventured in.  I've been missing out.   The service was friendly and well-paced.  We had what we needed without being bombarded.  The prices were incredibly reasonable. We sat on the patio which had a good vibe, and I would like to check out the inside as well.  The food was really good.  I can't give it 5-stars because MY food was not incredible, but it IS pretty much what i expect from a grilled chicken breast -- I wasn't super-hungry so i ordered light and the chicken was fairly dry, but still really tasty.  The ribs, on  the other hand, were fantastic!!  Next time I go, I'll definitely be going with a larger appetite and indulging in appetizers and desserts as well.

yikes.  i'm not even sure where to begin... the bread and dip is fantastic.  the bruschetta is a win.  the service was.... s.l.o.w. and a bit pretentious.     we went with another couple and thank goodness the company couldn't be any better for what was an awkward experience at best.     unless you're an experienced chef or frequent hoidy-toidy places the menu may as well be in greek.  so it took us all awhile to figure out what we wanted to eat.  once we DID decide and ordered one of the menu items  had an ingredient that was no longer in season and the dish was COMPLETELY different than what was on the menu.  Then about 20 minutes after we initially ordered our server came back to clarify one of the orders and then scurried back to the computer to put in our order.   all in all we waited an HOUR for our food.  We didn't even realize it had been that long until our server told us.  they apologized for the wait and got us all dessert as well as taking off a meal that just wasn't very good.  to be honest, none of the food was worth the price tag.  the only reason they got 2 stars instead of 1 is because they recovered themselves well.  i know and understand that things happen and no one's perfect.  i appreciate the effort made to try to make us happy, but it would have been nice to know why things were taking so long ahead of time and to know that this wasn't the norm.  although after reading many other Yelp reviews, maybe it IS the norm...   if i lived closer to the area i would check out a brunch and try to give a better review, but i'm not making the drive and spending money there again.

famous dave's has always been really good.  i've been to the location in chandler and also in peoria and in both places, the service was good and the food comes  out QUICK.  i have my standard full rack of baby backs every time i go in.  i  love love love the variety of sauces.  they are all great and i can vary depending on my mood (although i usually like  to mix  the  devil's spit and the sweet and zesty).  the ribs are always fall-off the bone tender.   on our last visit i finally decided to try something besides ribs (okay, i got the combo so i still got my baby backs) and i got the brisket.  i felt safe since i was getting the combo.  too many times i have had brisket that's just too tough or  drowned in sauce to cover up the dryness.  i was in for quite a treat.   the brisket was in nice thick strips and it  literally melted in my mouth.  i don't think i had to chew them at all.   service was outstanding.  i like that even though it was busy and it's  super easy to turn tables easy i didn't feel rushed to get out.

dr. matsumoto and her team are the best!  she came recommended to me by a friend who also goes there.  they truly care about the WHOLE child and not just their medical care.  we have seen 3 of the pediatricians in the office and they have all been great.  we developed a special bond with Dr. Miller during a very lengthy health issue with my son.  it's a 45 minute drive for us now that we've moved, but we still make the drive  to see dr.  miller because we  trust her to make the right decisions and offer the best advice for my child's health.

it's great as a family-friendly sports bar.  the food is VERY reasonably priced and good. The beers weren't superb, but definitely not bad, either.   our server was great -- there when we needed him and not there when we didn't. the manager was available and made a point of going to the tables, which sometimes i find awkward, but this one seemed very genuine and sincere.  it's definitely a place we'll return to -- especially during football season.

let me make this clear:  this review is for THIS Chipotle and this Chipotle ONLY!  i've never had what i consider a friendly experience here.  (mental note: the one on 59th and thunderbird is closer.  i need to go there next time)  the last time i went in, it was on the heels of a great experience at another location (if i have time it'll be right above this one).  first of all, there was  a pretty long line considering that it wasn't really busy.  i considered the possiblity that there could be ONE customer  up there that wasn't sure what they wanted or something along those lines, but as the line crept along i realized that it wasn't a customer, but indeed the staff behind the counter.  when i ordered my vegetarian burrito, the burrito maker didn't seem to know  what went in it.  come on guys, you have a VERY basic, very SIMPLE menu.  the veggie burrito gets by default: onion and pepper mix, BLACK BEANS (unlike the other burritos where you get a choice -- of course you CAN substitute the pinto beans, but if you don't specify you get the black).  he points to the pepper and onion mix and asks if that's what i want. "yes".  then he put the rice in.  no beans until i reminded him.  i realize we all have our off days, but there was just a bunch of stuff off here.  no one was smiling or friendly and the burritos seemed a little smaller than what i'm used  to at a Chipotle.  If i'd never been to one before, i'd probably just suck it up and enjoy my delish food, but i KNOW this isn't the standard and was really disappointed.  from now on i MUST remember that there is another one in my vicinity and go there instead.

I've never had pho before, so i can't compare this place to anywhere else (hence only 4 stars), but i thoroughly enjoyed my food. For the record i ordered the meatball and shrimp pho.  if i had anything to do over, i would have ordered more spring rolls.  they were fantastic!  We went on Saturday for dinner and it was relatively slow.  The service was at a perfect pace and friendly.   it will definitely be a common stop.

I'm really disappointed at some of the other reviews I'm reading here and they are totally opposite of the experience i had a couple of months ago on a Saturday late afternoon. My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.  The bartender was friendly and attentive without making us feel like we needed to order.  in fact, dinner was perfectly paced (if you go out to enjoy an evening and aren't just trying to shovel food in your face, that is).  We basically already knew what we wanted before we walked in as we had some friends that had been there the week before, but we still browsed the menu to make sure.  We each got margaritas and we agree that they are the best margaritas we've ever had. They were hand-crafted.  no rose's lime juice around the rim here!  the lime was squeezed around the rim.  Keep in mind this was happy hour, so it cost all of $4.50.   We decided to go with the ahi tuna appetizer.  Being a fan of good sushi, i was hesitant to get ahi at a non-sushi restaurant, but i was not disappointed in the least.  The sauce was great, but didn't drown out the flavor of the tuna and the chips were the perfect complement. When we finished our appetizer, the bartender took our food order.  We both got the surf and turf (crab legs and flat iron steak).  It's a good thing we had time to chat inbetween the appetizer and dinner coming because there was absolutely NO TALKING when food was in front of us as we were too busy enjoying the deliciousness.   during dinner we opted for another round of margaritas because they were oh-so-tasty.  I really have no complaints about this place.  It's definitely a place i plan on frequenting, but haven't had the opportunity to go again.  Plans for that soon and i expect to have the same amazing food and service.

i have always enjoyed pita jungle.  i love that the product is about as consistent as it gets in all of the locations i've been to.  However their portions have always been too big for me to take little-man unless we share something and honestly, i don't feel like shelling out $8 for him to have his own entree unless i decide it's leftover-worthy.   but now they have a kids menu and it's FANTASTIC!  it has become one of his favorite spots.  the only downside is that if you go when they are really busy it can be a bit loud and hard to hear, but i'm here for the food.

it's too much.  i get that they're trying to be a place where a variety of people with different tastes can all get together, but... the variety has gone too far.  i don't WANT a place where i can get coffee, breakfast, lunch, snack, beer, wine, study tables and live entertainment.  i want a place that does one to a few things WELL instead of doing a bunch of things mediocre.    it IS a great place to meet with people -- much more room to chat than most starbucks or other chains and you can spend a few bucks on a beverage instead of going to a restaurant and feeling like you need to scurry away when you're done eating.  But i don't even want to spend the money on the sub-par beverages.  which brings me to the other "too much".  the prices are way too high.  it's at least as expensive as starbucks (if not more for some things) and i still haven't found anything that i thought was delicious.  the safest thing to do is to order an iced tea -- i've never felt like sending it back, but the coffee is too weak and tastes a little.... off.   and the small is still 16oz -- too much.    i want to fall in love with this place and i've given it several  goes, but i just can't.

This is quickly becoming a favorite.  i went there twice in one week -- impressive.  I went in with my son last week and we both enjoyed it.  At 3, he's already a lemonade connoisseur, so we had to try both the strawberry and regular lemonade.  They were both so delicious, he had to keep going back and forth between the two.  They  have good deals on kids food.  For $4 you get your choice of hot dog, grilled cheese, beef pizza puff or chicken tenders all served with fries -- pretty standard.  The first time i went in i got the crispy philly (steak).  it was absolutely amazing!!!  i definitely recommend getting that if you've never been in before.  The next time i ordered Armando Spicy Steak Philly and it was also very very good. i finished it and probably should have stopped, but my mom still had almost half of her crispy philly left and i had to devour that, too.  There are still several things i want to try.  Everything i've seen looks good.   The service is really good, too! The staff is very helpful and friendly.  Even though it's counter-service, they bring you your food and regularly check to see how things are and if you need anything else.  Some people may think it's a bit pricey, but the most expensive item on the menu is the MJ Club (8.49).  Most items are around $7.  You can keep your cost down by getting a regular soda instead of their lemonade (but you won't want to).  For the quality of food and service you get, it is WELL worth the price and i will be going back.  Maybe even later this week.

maybe it's because the gelato shop by me closed and i had been craving gelato for a good month when i stumbled across this place.  maybe it's because i was just thinking of the delight in my son's eyes when i would surprise him by bringing his favorite tasty treat.  whatever the reason, i LOVED this place.  there are a few cozy places to sit and the service was fantastic!  i was offered samples of anything i would like to try, but i already had my favorite picked (mango) and it was delicious.  i've never had gelato i didn't like, but what made this place stand out was definitely the genuine and friendly service.

This review is long long long overdue.  None of the staff was pretentious or acted as though they were burdened by my presence (like some OTHER music venues.  Yes, Marquee, i'm looking at you).  Not only were they not pretentious, they were actually friendly!  Dave in security went out of his way to provide a great experience for us.  I'm sure that all-ages shows are extremely stressful for staff and keeping the under-21's separate from the drinkers without being burdensome to either group and Club Red is doing it right.

I love love love Smashburger!!  The accomodating staff bumps them up from a four-star to a five-star.  The food is delicious, but the staff really seems to have the guest in mind.  When they make mistakes (which they will because they are human...), they do everything they can to accomodate.  We ordered several items for there and some to go and there wasn't even a hiccup, but i've seen both management and staff go out of their way to save dissatisfied guests.

Press Coffee Roasters is a MUST for me whenever i'm near The Scottsdale Quarter.  The coffee and espresso is A-MAZING!!!  i've never gotten anything fancy, so i can't vouch for any of that stuff, but i'm hard to please when it comes to americanos.  my only beef is that they charge you extra for larger sizes of americanos even though you're only getting more water.  I understand that a larger cup costs more, but we're talking about espresso and water here, not a latte.  Not to mention that if i get a larger size and they're NOT putting more espresso in, i have to pay for the extra water AND the espresso or it just tastes too watered down.  It just doesn't make sense to me.

We went here a few weeks ago and I was less than impressed.  I'm not a huge fan of sweets, but frozen yogurt is my weakness.  I tried EVERY flavor trying to find one that was to my liking and they ALL had an awful aftertaste.  I have never ever ever ever been in a froyo place where i couldn't find SOMETHING that i liked.  Also, the girl behind the counter didn't seem to want to be there.  I know it's not the greatest job in the world, but a smile would have been nice.

i didn't think it was possible for Oregano's to exceed my expectations.  You can see a previous review of their North Scottsdale location to know that the bar has been set pretty high (on an already high expectation-level from many years' experience...)     i was somewhat hesitant to go on the debut week of the Glendale (Peoria?  i think it depends on what side of the street you're on...) location, but i've been watching the progress and couldn't stand it anymore, so today was the day.   note:  there hasn't been a single time i've driven by since they opened on Tuesday that they haven't been packed.  i had to check the time yesterday (NOT lunchtime during the week when most normal folk would be working...) when they were full to the gills.    when we arrived, we were quoted an hour and 45 minute wait.  Since i'm accustomed to a 45 minute wait there anyway, this seemed perfectly reasonable.  and we were prepared.  the waiting area is extremely comfortable:  well shaded by the building and stocked with heaters above the seating area for when it gets a bit chilly.  beverages were offered to those of us waiting and pizza samples were a-plenty.  managers were graciously accommodating tables of 10+ and 20+ amidst the rest of us.  no.one.looked.stressed.  not even remotely.  everyone was smiling, polite, and attentive.  let me emphasize that last word:  despite the fact that the restaurant was crawling with customers, the staff was still friendly and ATTENTIVE (without even blinking, i might add).  The food was delicious as always.  Quality did not suffer even a little bit from the other experiences i've had (although i was expecting a small slump due to logistical issues of a new restaurant and not quite having a "flow' yet).    This is a location that is sure to be a huge success in years and years to come.  So glad we have one that is closer than a 30-minute drive!!! :D
