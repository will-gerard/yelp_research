The best groomers I have been too.  Bathed and brushed our curly haired labradoodle.  We are growing her coat out and she had some matting.  They took care of it so we didn't have to shave her...yet.

I have been to many ski shops before and never have I had the customer service experience like I had today.  Gil Salvador helped me with my boots that haven't been fitting well and with some orthotics for my falling arch issue.  Gil was the most knowledgeable and professional person I have ever worked with.  It didn't surprise me to learn that he actually is from Seattle.  If you need to buy equipment see Gil, I guarantee you will be impressed and happy with your equipment.

4 stars bc it's excellent value pizza. Getting pizza by the slice is the best way to order here. Great place for a 6-7 dollar lunch.  It's not a high end fancy place, just a great quick pizza place.  Service is great!

I have taken our Labradoodle to several places and this is the best.  She is also super excited when we go and is in a great mood when I pick her up.  Since I have started bringing my dog scheduling has taken longer but I am guessing it's because they have a lot of customers.

Sandwiches are great.  Order at the counter, fast and excellent sandwiches.  Love the Sandwiches, Salami, Caprese and Meatball.  Favorite place to go after golfing on this side of town.

Best Chinese I ever had.  Mongolian Beef and the dumplings are always top notch.  Even the rice is awesome.   Service will be slow probably.  Get the food to go if you are fussy about that stuff.

Being born in Arizona, I take my Mexican Food pretty seriously and this is one of my favorites. I go specifically for the Carne Adovada plate.  Next time I go back I will be trying the Habanero Burger that everyone keeps talking about.

It a hipster place for sure, but all types are welcome.  I think it is the best coffee in town and a great place's to hang out with friends.  And lets not kid ourselves, all the people on their computers are not working nor are they studying.  House music play on!

Another great customer service experience.  Had to wash my dog tonite last minute and Cynthia and Alexis went out of their way to accommodate us.  It's good service and great attitudes that make me drive here when other places are closer.

This place like other AMC is going down hill fast.  Just 2 yrs ago I would have given 4-5 stars.  Seats are Falling apart.   Cracks in leather.   Last time I went the armrest was missing.   I know this place gets a lot of business and I would think profitable.  However if they don't maintain it I will stop going soon.

Pictures on the menu.  Anytime there are pictures on the menu(exception Asian food) the place has reduced costs and decided to to profitable over serving good food.  This is not the same place I liked 10 years ago.  Maybe its a good stock, but not a good place to eat.

There are so many great places to get fast Mexican food and this isn't one of them.  It's not terrible, and I still go from time to time because its close.  It's clean, quick and convenient.

Great massage and appreciated his instructions on how to relax even before starting.  Nice small studio.  I recommend him for any type of massage, but if you are athletic and need a deep massage I would look no further.

Love these pies.  Apple Carmel is one of the best desserts in town.  I find myself craving the blackberry pie.  They are all good and present very well.  I put them out at my parties and everyone immediately starts talking about how good they look.   Supporting small business is another huge plus.

Great street tacos.  Warm corn tortillas, filled with a plentiful amount of Carne Asada, with cilantro and onions.  Hot sauce was great.  The hot stuff is REALLY hot though. It's not in a great area, but don't let that keep you from trying this place.  Also the staff is super friendly.

My favorite Asian place in area.  If you haven't had Cambodian don't let it scare you, its just like Vietnamese. Family run place, I see us frequenting this place for years to come.  Get the Basil Seed drink, its good and you probably havent had anything like it before.

Best ice cream in town, the Kitchen Sink sundae was phenomenal.  The staff is so energetic and have so much pride in their products.  Be careful as this place is habit forming!   :  )

I have a new Barber and it's Matthew.    I normally go to a place next to where I live, but I was hurting for time and got a haircut on my lunch break.  Matthew is polite, professional and gives a great haircut.  I have been to a of great barbershops, this place is the best of them.

I am sure the owners are nice so I hate to write this.  The service is bad.  Only the owners work the floor.   And the food is not good at all. It gets good rating I believe from people that live in the neighborhood.  For the life of me I don't know why they just don't make it order at the counter because the service is so slow.

Sorry I have to rate this place low.  All 5 of us didnt like our entrees at all.  Korean Fried chicken was below average, tasted like a big chicken wing.  Hamburgers werent any good.  Our apps, corn dogs and calamri were actually good but the service was poor.   The menu has potential, the food items look good on the menu but it doesnt turn out well.  If you are looking for a hipster place to hang out, drink good beers and eat apps this maybe your place in Scottsdale. Hopefully they can turn it around

We have taken our 1.5yr old labradoodle to 5 different groomers and they all had trouble with her.  Sometimes they can't even finish because she is too anxious and playful.  Wag N Wash has groomed her twice now perfectly.  Most recently Lindsey groomed her and did an amazing job.  I couldn't believe what an amazing job she did and she acted like it was no problem.  The store is super clean employees are so nice. For putting up with my pup and having such a wonderful attitude I wont go anywhere else.

Short rib pasta was good and my wife enjoyed the pork tenderloin. I like that the menu hits all price levels, starting with a hamburger- pizza-pasta-steaks.    Really happy this place opened in our neighborhood.

Cinnamon Carmel Buns are one of my favorite things to eat in the valley.  Love getting them at the Tammie Coe booth at Vincents on Saturday.  I regular get the english muffins for breakfast and cupcakes for special occasions at home.

Great restaurant for the neighborhood.    Great atmosphere and a perfect place for all ages.  Nice patio and inside is very spacious.  Had the tri tip sandwich.  Was a little small but that's alright bc most places serve too much.   We will be back when we are on that side of town.

Food and service was excellent.  I consider it the best steak place in town.  Originally had low expectations bc it can be a scene and thought it would lack substance.   Food was phenomenal.

Not impressed.  Barbecue sauce was to "ketchupy"  side werent good either.  Maybe I need to go back, my feeling is that it is a good place to drink bc they have "moonshine", but I was not impressed.  If the reviews still hold at 4 stars in another 6 months I may have to go back...always an optimist.

What happened?! 2 yrs ago when I went to location on 7th street it was good.  This used to be one of the best places to get Carne Asada in AZ. Not anymore.  I had a feeling it wasn't going to be good after I noticed they have pictures of food on the menu.  It's always a sign of too corporate.

Fun place to go with friends.  Different.  Not a big Hot Pot expert but I thought the food was great.  We followed the tip of Coconut Curry and Lemongrass and they were both excellent although lemongrass was better.  We chose Lamb and Steak can't miss with those two.   I suggest following the servers directions on how to cook.  We tried our own way and wish we had listened.

I can't speak for every massage therapist but I did see a MT named Analus that gave me one of the best massages I've ever had.  I left work early bc of lower back pain and she healed it, I swear.  I was a new man walking out of there.   She noticed the tightness was in my glutes and worked it out.  She was unbelievable .   Can't rate 5 stars bc it's still a Massage Envy and overall I don't feel it worthy.   Analus would be getting 6 stars!

Ribs have been great although better at times then others.  The crabs are great too.  Place can be super busy.   There's not many of these places around that's for sure but if you are in the mood for crab legs and or ribs I highly recommend it . It will be busy so go early!

Not BBQ.  I doubt they have a smoker.  Had brisket and pulled pork.  Tastes like something your mom makes in the crockpot.  No bark...at all.  I was going to order ribs and decided not too. Burgers and beers maybe good, but if you are expecting a niece barky and fatty piece of brisket head to lil miss or Rudys.

Not nearly as good as Barrio Cafe.  Had the Pollo burrito w Chorizo.  Simply average.  Chips were great. If you have the time go to Barrio Cafe in Phoenix.  It's awesome.  If you are from out of town definitely be sure to get to the one in Phoenix(it's the original..

I have a smoker and know what good bbq is.  This is not good bbq.  I realize this place just opened review maybe to early.  Had the burnt ends , pieces were really chopped, it was flavorful but not great.  Pulled pork was avg.  I felt the inside had no flow, and was kind of dirty.   I will review this place again.

Food is average.  Great place to hang out though .  Coffee is the best in the hood.   I have to admit the 4th star is more in potential.  I want it to succeed in our hood.  We need more cool places like this.

Just as excellent as the downtown location.   Had the Chick and Chop.  Normally I have to get the nice thick cuts of bacon though.   Sourdough toast tastes like it just flew in from SF.  And the preserves are so good I could drink it.  Wife had flapjacks, not a big pancake guy, We didn't  think they were that special.

To the point, great place and worth going to.  Korean Bbq Short Rib appetizer was delicious.  I will be back soon for those. The cook with fire, from wood!  So there is a little extra flavor and it hits perfectly on this dish.  I had the Notorious BIG burger and it was good.  Fries were good and definitely homemade. Wife had the trout and she wasn't crazy about it.   Personally I never had "great" trout anywhere. Great atmosphere,  it is a little loud in there but the food was good.   We will be back.
