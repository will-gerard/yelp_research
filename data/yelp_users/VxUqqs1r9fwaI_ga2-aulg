What to say about Ticoz? Mojitos! The food is good, I love the courtyard, and their happy hour prices are phenomenal.  FYI, it's not just drinks, they have an appetizer happy hour menu that you pretty much have to beg to hear about.  All in all a good experience, I've had better food, but this is a fun place.

If there was an option for 3 1/2 stars, I would have chosen that one. I bumped it up to 4 due to sushi and prices.  I love, love, love this place for sushi. It is my favorite in the valley. Have I had better sushi, yes, but not in Phoenix.    My biggest issue is the service. It can range from downright friendly, to "hello...I swear I am sitting here and I exist".  So word of warning, if you go on the right day (which to be honest can vary), you get great service and sushi, with reasonable prices. You go on an off-day (which seems more frequent), be prepared to wait, and wait...  Dozo, I do love you though you make me wait:)

I have gone here twice and both times our dog, Luna, was treated wonderfully. The first time was for an allergic reaction to a bite, and they got her well and us off with all the necessary medicine. Unfortunately, the 2nd time there was nothing they could do for her, but they provided us a private room and notified us about some different options we could choose from. At no time did I feel rushed nor pressured to use their services, and I appreciated everything they helped us with that day.  Five stars for their staff's kindness (from the front desk to the vets) and consideration during one of the hardest times we've ever had to face.

A group of four of us went last night for the first time. I had purchased a Groupon, and was excited to check out a new winery. The service when we arrived was dismal. It took a tour leader from another group to flag someone's attention. We had reservations yet they acted surprised to see us. Given all this, if the wine had been great, we could have forgiven the service...it was not great. I don't expect the wine to be of Napa or Sonoma quality, but at least make up for it with your service.  Disappointing, and I'll stick to other local wine bars moving forward. I honestly can't believe this place has an average of 4 stars...

This is a tough one to write and I was torn between two and three stars.  The sweat dripping down my back and arms made it the lower rating...  Here's the dealio; I make reservations for Restaurant Week for 6 people. I call the day before and ask if I can bump that number up. Sure, no problem they say, so I hang up happy as can be.  Imagine my surprise when we get to the restaurant and they have the original reservation only.  Our option is to crowd people into a small table or sit outside separate. We choose the latter, not really thinking about the lack of misters...  The reason why I'm truly upset is that there were other free tables inside but I'm sure they were reserved (how nice to hold it for them and not us...).  I'm not trying to be bitter, but I am still having heat flashes. The food was okay, I liked the Cresti de Gallo, but everything else was just okay. The owner brought out some flatbread as well as an apology, but I would have preferred my meal to be outstanding in lieue of burning up outside. At least I know to avoid NOCA for Restaurant Week moving forward

Here's the thing I can only rate a pest control company as five stars or no stars. Either they've killed the bugs, and I'm happy, or they haven't, and unsmiley face occurs.  HDE has been my go-to place for a few years now. I call them 2-3/year, and they take care of any bug issues. We had a problem with Black Widows, and after HDE came out, no problem. My only issue is the dead bugs I find after they come through, which is not their problem, and means they've done their job very well. Thanks for keeping me from screeching in terror at a spider invasion...

I will give this place a solid four stars. Great food and decent prices. You can't beat all day happy hour on Tuesdays... Plus, any place that can make a good Michelada is a sure thing for me.  Their tacos are delicious (I've tried most of them, and I usually end up with the shrimp, Fish and Pibil). Even without happy hour they aren't ridiculously priced. Start off with the guacamole and elote and your tummy will be a happy camper:)  One of my visits, they completely misplaced our dinner order, but the manager came out and apologized and gave us some free dessert. To be honest we were enjoying the apps and drinks that we didn't feel that bad anyway...but I do appreciate good service!

I drive all the way out here from Phoenix just to have Kim cut my hair! This is a great salon and I never walk out wondering what the heck happened to me.  Ask for Kim and you wont be sorry:)
