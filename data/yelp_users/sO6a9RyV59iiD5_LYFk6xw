I have been a big fan of this restaurant until this evening.  I had loved the fish and chips, but tonight the portion was measly and the chips were frozen fries instead of the waffle ones.  For the price, which I use to not mind because the food was exceptional was a rip off. Kids pizza was down right nasty.  Unfortunately, this neighborhood gem has turned into a huge disappointment.
