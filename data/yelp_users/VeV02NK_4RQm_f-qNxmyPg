I did go back and had the enchiladas plate which was what you'd expect but yummy and filling.  Good if you got the craving for mexican food. Easy on the wallet too.

I work in Tempe and this Counsin's Subs in quickly becoming one of my favorite lunch spots.  They are quick!  I've never waited more than 5 mins for my food.  Usually my sub is ready even before I get my fountain drink.  I love their cold veggie sub but the one that keeps me coming at night is their Italian Special.  I just don't want it to end.  I get it on their Italian bread and they have little containers with vinegar and oil off the to side that I shake up and drizzle on.  Give it a try if you are in a rush and wanting a tasty satisfying sub.

Walked in without an appointment on a Thursday and with my own design and walked out a couple hours later with a lovely new scroll work around my forearm by Tony (who had some excellent tunes on shuffle btw).  The shop is relaxed. Staff was friendly and unpretentious. They have all the artist portfolio's up front for you to browse through.  They had a tv in the waiting room and lots of tattoo magazines and the like as well as some tattoo flash, body jewelry, and merchandise to look through.  I felt very comfortable from beginning to end and as a result would recommend the shop and artist to my friends.  I'll be returning for more ink soon.

Anytime anyone tells me they like "good beer" I bring them here. That is, if they haven't already been.   There is an impressive assortment beer and fermented drinks here. The make your own 6 pack bit is awesome. The rotating tap is a winner as well. Their food is above average quality bar food. I can vouch for the sliders and potato salad as its what I always get but their personal pizzas and sandwiches always look and smell appetizing.   I appreciate the vibe at this place. The staff is friendly and attentive. No Scottsdale snootiness or Tempe douchyness (usually) and they have plenty of seating and a good assortment of board games and the like the play.   Really their motto says it all: "No crap on tap!"

I usually order the Afghani - spicy turkey.  I put everything on it and every minute of it is delicious.   Worth mentioning is their ice tea.  Its brewed. Not that brisk/syrup and water bullshizz I've been seeing everywhere.  And its yummy! They usually have two types to choose from.  A black tea and a jasmine green tea (I think).  I always bring a book with me since its usually a bit of a wait (5-10mins), especially during lunch.  But I've never had  a meal there that didn't warrant that.  Bonus: the employees are nice and friendly and the people that frequent the spot are well mannered folk who at the very least, are entertaining to watch.

I use to work in the same building Caf√© Boa and when the office caught onto the fabulous happy hour (5-7) it became a favorite spot.  Admittedly, I've never been here for anything other than happy hour but I mean to! Really I do...  $2 Stella and half off their signature martinis!  "Anastasia" is to die for: muddled strawberries and basil.  Sounds weird but its so very delicious (and strong depending on who makes it and how long they muddle the strawberries).  The drink has sparked so many conversations with the uninitiated ("what drink is that?"). The Orchard is also quite nice: pear and lavender.  Also many of their appetizers are half off during happy hour.  The shrimp and the capriatta are what I'd recommend. That being said, happy hour prices are only valid in the bar area which has limited seating so get there early and claim a spot because it can get crowded pretty quickly with business folks looking to unwind after work.  I've been only once or twice on the weekend as the happy hour is 7 days a week!  They do have a flat-screen up on the wall playing sports which takes away from the pleasant atmosphere for me.  If you want to watch a sports game go to the Tavern just a few feet away or one of the other very many establishments on Mill that cater to the sports aficionado.   Their music selection is above-average for me.  Chill, classy, downtempo, and comtemporary.  I've heard radiohead, massive attack, portishead, smiths played there; nothing jarring or overly trendy.  The lighting is nice, slightly dim. Small votive candles abound. They use to give free bread baskets with some rotating dips and spreads, I miss that.  The wait staff is friendly, hip, and knowledgeable but not pretentious.  I can't recall ever being displeased with the service here.  When it gets crowded obviously you are going to wait a bit for the server to make her rounds though.  I recommend sitting right up at the bar if its just you and other person, otherwise get there early and steak out one of the 2 long tables they have in the bar area.  The clientele is not the usual Tempe crowd.  In my experience its young professionals that veer more towards "hip" than "spirited" which is just fine with me; a welcome change from the usual Mill Ave scene.

I went to Thai Basil by myself today for lunch about 12:30. Ordered Peanut Curry (Panang) with tofu and no broccoli (personal preference) and a thai ice tea.  I got to choose my level of "heat" - I said "as hot as possible."The total came to just under $10 and less than 10 minutes later my food was ready.  Panang is one of my favorite thai dishes and its typically the first thing I order when going to a new thai restaurant.  Thai Basil's version of it had a thick sauce, which I love, and the tofu seemed to be grilled or cooked in some way that gave it a nice firm and chewy texture.  The meal also comes with rice (I took mine white) and a spring roll with that spicy clear-orange dipping sauce.  It was delicious.  The vegetables that came with the panang were big hearty pieces that were well cooked, not too soggy or hard.  The thai ice tea was thick and yummy, an excellent way to wash down the panang.  That being said, for ordering my dish "very hot" it was not all that spicy.  I'd say it was moderate, but I have a high spice tolerance.  I was surprised to see there was seating available in the peak of lunch hour, and next time I go, and there will be a next time, I'll bring some friends and grab a seat. The seating inside the restaurant is kind of cramped, I had to scoot out of the way to let the waitress's pass when I walked to and from the counter.

The beer selection sucks and the little bit of food I have had here was unimpressive. BUT! A good place to people watch? And be watched? If you're into that.

An impromptu Sunday night dinner invite from my significant other brought Tapino into my life.  I had no idea I was about to eat some of the best food of my life.  Let me say also that this was my first experience with tapas and that I'm by no means an experienced wine drinker, though I'm enthusiastic to learn.  The atmosphere was chill.  It was classy, no doubt.  I may have been a tad under dressed in jeans since I had no idea where I was going (downtown girl through and through) but was not treated any less by the waitstaff.  Chill downtemp/trip-hop was playing.  We were seated inside.  There was good mood lighting (even if they did have fake candles at the table).  What ensued was a stream deliciousness.  Everything was delicious. Everything. My favorite were the bacon wrapped dates and the short rib.  We drank a bottle of AZ stronghold. We ordered about 11 different plates between 2 of us.  We did not leave hungry but were not stuffed.  The service was excellent.  Very pleasant waitstaff.  My guy was a little irked that the wine was slightly chilled, I guess its suppose to be room temp.  It was still delicious to me.  The whole experience was so awesome.  A great pre-cursor to a hot sex.  Heh. I will definitely be back.

Those little suckers are filling.  They kinda sit like a loving brick in your gut which is why I don't frequent this place for lunch much unless I want to nap.  They have a pretty extensive list of "pasties" available, including quite a few vegetarian options.  They all come with dipping sauce.  The crust is to die for.  Service is good. Prompt and attentive.  Good Ice tea of the "tropical" variety.  Brewed.  They serve alcohol although I've never had as I've only been during lunch.  Upbeat atmosphere.  Good tunes.  What can I say, I'm a fan.

I like this place.  Especially on weekday nights.  Reasonable drink prices.  Decent selection (my faves are the Vanilla Porter and Frambois Lambic). Great mood lighting.  Good tunes.  I was just in there tonight (Monday) and there was live jazz going down.  First fridays its kinda crazy but if you hang out for a bit eventually you'll get a seat.  The art on the walls is kinda hit-or-miss.  Sometimes thought provoking.  Other times vomit-invoking (in the "how did this merit being hung on a wall in a public space" sense).  Interesting at the very least.  If you hate the bar vibe in Tempe like I do, you will likely enjoy this spot.  Wish they had beer on tap and some edibles (cheese, chocolate, nuts) though.

I eat at pita jungle at least once a week and at most about 3.  The Indian School spot is conveniently located between my apt and my work - a 10 mins drive from either.  My typical lunch there is the beef gyro ($6) with passion fruit ice tea which hits right on the money with my lunch budget - $10bucks. Sometimes i get a multiberry smoothie to go, which I highly recommend.  Its this lovely purple color, tastes of fresh berries, and its not too sweet - a healthy and refreshing alternative to desert.  I experience sudden inexplicable cravings for their beef gyro at times.  The meat is delicious, the pickle and tzatzikii compliment it so well... I'm getting cravings just thinking about it.  If you decide to get some hummus as a starter, I recommend the small order with 2 pitas (comes with 1) instead of the large order which seems better suited for 3+ people.  I had the seafood provencal from their seasonal menu yesterday, and it was so very delicious i was literally making yummy sounds (mmmm..!) after every bite.   Their lunch crowd has gone down in size recently, maybe because its so hot out.  The parking in that strip mall is hell during lunch time too.  There are various different lunch establishments and drivers can get pretty aggressive when they see a car pulling out.  The 2 seater tables they have inside are a little cramped.  I prefer more space between me fellow diners and myself and some of my heavier friends find it a little difficult to wedge between tables without interrupting seated diners. Also, forget about having a private conversation if there is a table seated next to yours. The tabletop is at capacity with 2 plates and 2 drinks.  The inside of this location has a huge mirror hanging that make it feel way bigger than it is.  It also brings in tons of light and lets you check out the crowd, or more notably, the hot hipster wait staff. That being said, I've never, not even during any super busy lunch rush visits, had bad or unsatisfactory service.  They run lunch rush like a well oiled machine.    One last thing, I am a very thirsty individual, and I love me some good iced tea, on a couple occasions I've been offered refills for my tea in to-go cups. I know its a small thing but, for me it goes a long way.

Love the vegetarian sampler, which I usually get with wheat pitas. Delicious falafel. And I think their baklava nests are also quite nice. You can taste just a hint of flower in there which is lovely.  They use the same flower essence in the lemonade, which I have to say *is* pretty good, especially since I don't really like lemonade. Its way too sweet though. Once I took it home and watered it down which made it much more refreshing. Otherwise I feel like I need some water to wash down the lemonade.

Ok. So I love this store.  I never thought I would re-live the childhood joy and anticipation of going to the toy store until I found this place. I'm so glad phoenix finally got a designer vinyl toy store!  its kind of our equivalent of kidrobot store only... better.   I limit myself to one visit per week as this place has really sparked my vinyl toy obsession.  They have an excellent selection of not only toys, but books on related things and artists.  As far as the toys go though, there are tons of blind box series to pick from and plenty of bigger limited items.  There are even some big limited pieces and prints on display, gallery style.  Toys range from $5 - $100's so there is something for everyone's price range.  They also have t-shirts, key chains, stickers, bags, stationary... a little seating area for you to sit down and enjoy the atmosphere and brows a magazine and cold beverage.  There is always good tunes playing and the staff is fun, friendly, and very knowledgeable.  There is a mailing list sign up by the register or you can subscribe to their blogs on myspace to receive updates on weekly new stuff and sales.  A great place to take friends from out of town or the suburbs or to buy gifts for any urbanites in your life.

HUGE inventory. Last time I went around the store like 4 times and kept finding new things I didn't see before.  So glad we have a spot like this in PHX.

Ok. So this was my second trip there.  The first time was early on a Tuesday about a year ago, and I remember it being somewhat enjoyable. This time was about 2pm on a Sunday.  We wait about 5 mins for a table even though there seems to be plenty of seating.  First of all, our waitress must have been stoned.  For her sake I hope she was not naturally that slow.  We had plenty of time to look over our menus since there seemed to be only 2 people working.  After telling her my order, included what I wanted as side, she informs me I have a choice of side and tells me my options. "Like I said, I'll have the bacon."  No water offered to start off with, had to request some water.  No refills offered for our tea. WTF? Who sees a visibly empty glass on a table and does not offer a refill.  The drink glass was tiny too.  Like juice-cup style.  The bacon sucked so bad.  Hard, thin, no flavor (maybe I'm spoiled from Matt's)   The portions were small.  The waitress look flustered and although she was cute and trendy looking, I don't go out to eat for trend watching.  I had the Sweet Potato pancakes.  She forgot the maple syrup.  Had to wait like 10 mins for her to come around so I could flag her down to bring some.  The "toast" was cold hard bread.  The crust was so hard it hurt my mouth.  The people around us seemed to be having a nice time.  Meanwhile I'm sitting there kinda disgusted actually with how everything is going down.  Maybe we were being discriminated against because we didnt get all spiffied up to go to brunch? I had time to speculate...  The only positive thing I can say was that it was a beautiful day outside and they had an impressive tea selection.  I got the impression this place put more emphasis on looking "cool and hip" on paper than good service and execution.  If you want to have long conversations, browse periodicals, being outside on a nice day, and be seen this might be the place for you.  If you want prompt service, generous yummy portions, keen waitstaff that recognize you exist and the money you are about to drop there goes towards their paycheck, not the best choice.

Its amazing how much they are charging for their flavorless greasy food. I was so underwhelmed I felt obligated to write this here review, which is also appropriately underwhelming. The best thing about the meal was the iced tea. Oh, I guess the service was decent.

We eat take out here once a week and I pretty much always get the same thing. Panang curry with tofu and brown rice - spicy. The dinner portion is big enough to save half for lunch the next day or for sharing IMO. Sometimes I get overtaken by the tastiness and grub it all down in one sitting though.  I'm so glad they have a downtown location as I really enjoy the Tempe location for lunch.  The thai tea here is also quite yummy and could double as desert.

Loved the casual dress code on the waitstaff.  Comfortable staff makes for happier staff makes for better service is what i'm saying because the quality of service was right on.  The decor was pleasant.  Dim, tea lights, and track lighting that seemed to be spotlighting the dishes as they landed in front of me.  An extensive wine list that was admittedly a bit overwhelming.  Server said we were free to sample if we wanted.  I had the Segway to drink - an alcoholic cucumber cocktail. Yummy and refreshing, didn't compete with my food.  Chilled melon soup was tasty.  Could have used something crunchy and/or salty in my opinion.   Entree was a scallops and chorizo over a cauliflower puree with corn.  Hell. Yes.  One of the tastiest things I've ever had the pleasure of consuming.  I forced myself to eat it slower than something so yummy might merit in an effort to make the experience last just a litttle bit longer.  Walked away full, with a spring in my step and a smile on my face.

A couple weeks ago I had the hottest meal of my life here.  At one point I literally thought I heard sirens and found myself zonning out on my conversation my mind instead wandering to where the nearest ER was and if my insurance would cover something like this.  Anyway,  it was a good thing.  A very good thing.   I love the panag and this place makes it the way I like it.  I usually get it Thai Hot which is their "hottest" spice level but this time, maybe the cooks had read some of the "not hot enough" flavored reviews on here, because he brought the heat.  Their Thai Iced-Tea is yummy.  It was my only saving grace.  I slowly sipped at when I felt tears welling in my eyes.    During lunch I'd say arrive early or just after lunch rush.  They have gotten better with their service from when they first opened several months ago.  When its packed you are going to wait though.  They offer this little bowl of hot seasoned water (soup?) before the meal which I think is nice.  Keeps you entertained while you wait for your food.  Also I love that they throw in a spring roll for dishes on their lunch menu.  Oh, the atmosphere in there is pretty nice for a spot tucked away in a strip mall.  Last time i was there they were playing some nice jazz.  The decor is earthy and warm.  One thing though, they could REALLY use a water feature.  Like a fountain or a fish tank.  Oh yeah, I don't think I'll be getting Thai Hot again. But I will most certainly be back.

Meh. I've had better $200 meals.  That includes 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 deserts, and a bottle of wine.  First off, my dish was oversalted.  Portions were small.  Cotton candy was surprising and unique but just cotton candy in the end.  The butter gelato was the highlight for me.  Service was good.  Atmosphere was nice. I have no problem spending money on fine dining as long I walk outta there beyond satisfied.  I mean, its all part of the experience yeah?  The food wasn't anything special to me.  I walked out of this place wishing I had spent that money elsewhere.  Might be back to try something else.  Maybe.

This was my restaurant of choice when I lived in Phoenix. I came here for 4 birthdays in a row. My birthdays that is. Service is always spectacular. Its been said before but the chorizo stuffed dates are not to be missed. The only downside is over-ordering and walking out of here in a comfort food coma.

Its yummy.  And it could be that I don't know any better (never been to any other self serve yogurt + toppings places after all) but the concept is brilliant and this is my first time experiencing it.  I love doing it myself just the way I KNOW i like it.  Adding all the toppings I want, sometimes 10 diff things... a pinch of this, a couple spoons of that ect.  The toppings seem to be decent quality and there is quite the variety.  I appreciate all the fruit. They switch up the yogurt flavors every day it seems... my favorite is the white boy vanilla with some chocolate or orange depending on my mood.  I typically add some of the regular tart on the bottom as it provides a nice lil kick.  If they don't have sample cups up front, just ask. And also they have customer loyalty cards if you think you'll be coming by frequently.  Yes its expensive.  But to me its worth it. I guess it all depends on how you like to eat your yogurt.

Birthday cake yogurt with fruity pebbles topping. The end.  I've gone here so much the price thing has started to bother me...  I cant afford to go at the rate i've been going (once a week)  Also, the clientele makes me feel kinda violent more times than not.  Particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.  The comments and laughter of uppity tweens is not for me.

Sometimes, I'd rather pay someone to deal with my feet than do it myself. Thus, after a quick look around yelp, I found this place. The next day I was there.  Its a quick drive from the 143 up 48th St for me. Arrived about 4:30. No wait. Picked a polish. Admittedly more choices than I expected and nicer brands too, OPI galore. To my delight there were some lovely darker colors.  The massage chair was nice. Rather intense but not uncomfortably so. A youngish man did my pedicure. There were probably about 5 other patrons in there getting their nails and toes done as well.  I got the "spa pedicure" $22. And It was surprisingly relaxing. Between the heavy duty chair massage, foot rubs, and leg massage, I found myself genuinely blissed out a couple time.  My pedicure on the other hand, was nice. Not bad. Not amazing. My big toe is a bit "fleshy" and I noticed upon closer inspection that there was a good 1/8 inch maybe on each side that was naked (sans polish) on both feet. Maybe he was trying to make my big toe look skinny (eek), but I would trade a couple mins off the leg massage for the full toe coverage (heh) my piggies require.  Regardless, I am still pleased and will definitely be returning and likely trying out some more services.

I go here for brunch every time I'm in Phoenix. And although I've tried most things on the menu, I usually get the ham sandwich with a baked egg, the porridge, and an iced coffee. Great service and atmosphere. Check out the lovely patio if the weather is good. I love you Astor!
