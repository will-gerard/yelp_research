The main reason that Ranch Market is great is because of the price.  It's cheap, you almost can't find cheaper produce around town.  However, it comes with a price.  The produce quality is hit and miss.  One week you may find great deals on grapes, but the cauliflower that was on deal starting two weeks earlier is still there and in pretty bad shape.  So you can stock up on the grapes, but you have to pass on the cauliflower.  That's sort of how it is.  That said, if you don't mind shopping like that, you can get a ton of fruit and veg, like bags full for $20.    The other thing is they don't really do organic options at all.  I've found that some of their produce (rarely, I should say, does this happen) but I'll examine the label and see that it's actually organic.  But it's just by happenstance, they don't have an organic section or options.  When it does happen though, it's a great deal, you can get it for really cheap.  But more often than not, the produce is not organic and is not local.  The oranges in the spring are almost always from Mesa though, so that's nice.  So it's sort of like the dollar store for produce.  You can get some great deals, you just need to be willing to pick through things and figure out what is decent quality.  Beyond the produce, they do also have a nice selection of cheeses and dry goods, along with local honeys, salsas, soup mixes, etc.  Those tend to be a little more pricey, but it's nice to be able to buy local products.  Overall, I wish I could give it 3.5 stars.  I'll err on the generous side and do 4.  What makes me want to vote it a little lower is the overall produce quality, the fact that most of the produce is not local, and that there are few, if any, organic options.  But I suppose all that comes at a price, and that's what Ranch Market is really good at is keeping the prices low.

I love this REI. They staff this location well so that there's always plenty of people to help you and they are all helpful and knowledgeable. It's not a huge REI, so they won't necessarily have everything (like I went to get a paddle board and lucked out as they had a few in the back, but they said typically the Paradise Valley store is the only one that carries a stock of them). The guy I spoke with with really knowledgeable about paddle boarding and helped me pick a board that would be good for riding with a dog.  They're very dog friendly. People were very nice to my dog and I've gotten a bunch of stuff for her at this REI as the sports equipment for dogs at Petsmarts and Petcos is crap. If you need actual trail shoes (that don't fall apart), winter running jackets, life vests, high visibility vests, etc for your dog, this is the place to go. They carry RuffWear gear, which is higher quality and more functional than most brands. And they have lots of stuff for larger dogs that often the pet stores don't carry.

I stopped in here a little after 1pm (they close at 2 and open again in the evening). It's not in the nicest part of Mesa, so I was worried how it would be inside. But it's a nice little hole in the wall. It's clean and the service was friendly.  I ordered the lunch sushi combo (which is 8 pcs sushi, 2 pc shrimp tempura, 2 pc vegetable tempura for $9) and some eel and avocado rolls. When it came out, I was shocked by the amount of fish. For me, I hate when you order sushi and its a giant lump of rice with a tiny sliver of fish on top. These sushi were a small lump of rice with a slab of fish. It's like two pieces of generously sliced sashimi, no kidding. In fact, I just moved half the fish to the rice and ate the other half as sashimi. The fish was fresh and good.  The roll was really good too. It was a little bigger/wider than I normally like. But the flavors were good, and again, lots of eel.  All of that food, plus a bowl of miso, a salad and a mug of green tea cost $18. That's a great value. So yeah, Sushi Kee may not ever win any culinary awards. They presentation isn't as good as what you might find in much more expensive Japanese restaurants. But they are good and a great value. If you want a lot of good sushi without taking out a second mortgage, check out Sushi Kee.

I always have pretty good experiences here.  And I almost always take my car here for service, with the Pep Boys Rewards, it definitely makes it worth it.  I've found the mechanics here to be honest about what service is needed, they don't try to rake you over the coals and get you to do a bunch of unnecessary stuff.  And there are usually good coupons online for whatever you need done that make the prices reasonable.

My experience was good. I walked in on a Friday after work, I had to wait maybe 5 minutes or so to get in a chair. And maybe another 5 before they started working on me.  I got a nice mani pedi. I like the gel nail polish because they cure it with UV lights and so it's completely dried and cured before you're done and ready to pay.  The people in the nail salon were nice and friendly. I felt welcome and I think they did a good job.

I love this Ace.  It is SO much better than the big box chains.  Because people can actually help you when you have a question.  We always go to Ace first, and we are always surprised that we don't have to go anywhere else.  Even though the store is not nearly as large as one of the mega-hardware stores, it stills always seems to carry the little odds and ends you need.  And people in the store know where things are and can give you advice if you don't know exactly what you're looking for.  Definitely go to Ace FIRST!

Yeah, this place is pretty legit.  Not fancy, but g-damn, the bagels are good.  Plus, the prepared bagels (I got the lox bagel) are pretty amazeballs.  I'm glad I impulse-bought a bunch of swiss cheese bagels while I was there.  Amazing.  This is your one-stop carb-shopping paradise.  Get 'er done.

So, I'm not exactly sure why I was cut off or kicked out. Because I spoke with the manager, and the security manager. And neither seemed to understand why I was kicked out, but neither seemed to be able to do anything about it either. They both said I was respectful to the server and staff. I had ordered one round of drinks for my friends, and paid 100% tip on top of the bill. Literally. But they said I was "over served" despite basically being very kind to the waitstaff and otherwise. So apparently, don't be kind to the waitstaff, bartenders, or other patrons or you'll be kicked out? Very bizarre. I spoke with the  security and bar management and they both said they didn't understand why that was the decision. But all my friends were inside that had been drinking for the same amount of time as me. So I'm not sure why I was flagged except that I'm friendly basically. A bit disappointing. Apparently not where you should go to drink if the point is to get drunk? Shame.

Super Farm Market is as good as it gets for East Valley farmers markets, if not the entire valley.  Every Thursday evening from 4:30-7:30 pm all year round, the market is on.  There's fresh, local produce, artisan breads and pastas, candies, cookies, cakes, salas, jams, honey, dog treats, vegan snacks, grass fed beef, and more.  Not to mention the farm sells farm fresh, artisan cheeses, butters, milk, ice cream, yogurt, and eggs.  And Udder Delights is there with desserts and ice cream.  It's by far the most convenient farmer's market as it's indoor year round.  And you go to each vendor and your charges are written on a ticket, so you pay once at the end (like a grocery) with cash or credit.    You can also visit Mooster's Mootique, the farm's gift shop, for all sorts of cute things for kids and adults alike.  The market also has a free petting zoo with sheep, goats and baby calves to keep the little ones entertained.  They usually do horse rides and hay rides during the market as well, so it's a great chance to see the farm if you haven't already.  If you live in the east valley, there's no reason not to be at Super Farm Market.

I have spent some time in Cornwall and have eaten my fair share of pasties.  So I was excited to try this place out.  Right off the bat though, I love that they have so many vegetarian and vegan options.  That's really nice.  I tried the balsamic portobello mushroom pasty, the chips, and the chocolate bread and butter pudding.  Overall, it was good.  I would say that, aside from the chips, it's not as authentic as I would have hoped for.  The pasty itself was a bit more "posh" than what you'd normally find.  To be fair, I didn't do a direct comparison.  In Cornwall, I had previously eaten the more traditional pasties like cheese and onion, pork and apple, etc.  But I'm not looking a gift horse in the mouth, as I said, I was very happy to have so many veggie options.  But the pasty did seem more posh in term of the pastry being more refined than what you'd normally see.  I mean, basically, the pasties they serve are actually probably better made and prepared than real pasties... the pastry is crisper but also a little tougher.  Overall, I like my pasty though.  The chocolate bread and butter pudding though, I'm afraid, was really not what I was expecting.  Real bread and butter pudding is made with chunks of bread and, you guessed it, soaked in butter (among other things).  What I was served was something more like a sponge cake soaked with brandy and comes with a little pot of creme anglaise (which I don't think I was ever served at any time in the UK, but hey ho!).  The sponge cake has more of a consistency of treacle tart/pudding.  Minus the treacle, of course.  And again, it tasted really nice and was a lovely dessert in it's own right, it was just not bread and butter pudding.  It looked like a striped cube, by the way.  So I guess for the food that's my review, that the food was very good in it's own right, and possibly is a posh version of those foods, but I didn't get that authentic homey feel from it like I hoped because it wasn't the real thing.  I would definitely go there again though.  The service was really good.  I liked the vibe of the place and the decor is cool.  And the food was tasty overall.  It's a nice, casual, fun restaurant.

We had a weird experience here. We were looking forward to trying the food based on the good reviews. When we came in, they said seat yourself. So we decided to sit at the bar area. The bartender came and gave us menus and then almost immediately asked for our drink orders, but I hadn't had any time to look at the menu (it was Sunday, so they have all day happy hour). Well I guess that was the kiss of death with our bartender because he literally never returned to us.   So we eventually moved down to the dining table area so that we could get service. I made eye contact with the waitress several times but she was I guess working a different section and never approached us. Then finally, our waitress stopped and asked if we were ok.   By this time we had been there 30 minutes already and no one had even taken a drink order. So we placed an order. But then my husband and I just decided that the whole thing was odd and uncomfortable and we didn't feel welcome. So we grabbed the other waitress and asked them to cancel our order. She asked why we wanted to leave and offered to comp our meals. But we just felt uncomfortable, so we left.   It seems like a local hangout, so you probably get good service if you are from QC and a regular. Or maybe we were just unlucky. But we weren't able to try it out. Not a great experience though, I've never left a restaurant like that before.  Also, the menu was weird too.  Most japanese places have a menu section that has other japanese foods that aren't sushi (like chirasu and teriyaki, etc.).  Not this place.  They have the paper sheet that you tick off the sushi or whatever that you want on that.  But beyond that, their actual menu has drinks, appetizers and then the "I hate sushi" menu that has burgers and stuff on it.  It seemed funny at first.  Except that if I go to a Japanese place, I probably want sushi.  So really, their menu is pretty limited.

We really enjoyed out visit to Red Koi. We went on a Sunday evening shortly after they opened  (at 5:00pm on Sundays). There were only two other tables dining when we came in. Our waiter was really friendly, but not overbearing.  The menu is good, we were able to pick from happy hour specials as well as the full menu. I got the small sashimi plate, seaweed salad and the shrimp and vegetable tempura. For dessert, I got the mango mousse cake for dessert. My husband and I also split the eel and white tuna nigiri. It was all really good, fresh, delicious.   I also thought the prices and portion sizes were competitive, very reasonable for Japanese. My husband got beef yakisoba and it was a nice big portion. With my meal, my husband's dinner, his cheesecake (which he said was very good) for dessert, and a carafe of sake, our total was $57. But we had really a lot of food.  It was great, and the atmosphere was really nice. I heard some Zero 7 and something from the Tron soundtrack, so they tend to play low key electronic music, very nice. My husband and I will definitely be going again, this was a nice find.

I just happened on this place via Yelp. I had just gone on a run (that was faster than I should have done) the day before and had a triathlon the next day. Waking up sore and tight, I needed an last minute sports massage and having called around to about 5 places, seemed out of luck. Fortunately, when I called Simple Cure, they had had a last minute cancellation so I got in.  I guess it was meant to be. Shay gave me the best sports massage I've ever gotten. I told her my IT bands were tight, I had some soreness in my back and deltoids. She did an amazing job and loosened everything up. Shay comes from a long line of female boxers, so she herself has a personal understanding of what athletes need.  I immediately bought a membership (which gives you a hefty discount on massages for the year). The location isn't convenient for me, but I won't go anywhere else for a sports massage again.  The price is, by the way, very competitive. Even without the member discount, a one hour specialty massage would be $65. So, quality and value makes me give them 5 stars.

Avante is fantastic.  I stumbled upon them as I was looking for a place to get a few things printed last minute for our animal rescue.  So I just stopped by the office.  They are really friendly, took on the job and actually printed while I waited.  And then on top of that, they donated the printing to our rescue.  They're fantastic!  About a week later, I had one day to get a poster printed for an event our rescue was doing.  So I emailed the files first thing in the morning to Renee (who is amazing), they had the poster printed by the end of the day!  The quality is great, the employees and service are exceptional, and the prices are competitive.  This is exactly the kind of place you want to do business with and support!

I had first used AZ Maid Beautiful several years ago after buying a Groupon or something like that.  I thought they were pretty good then.  Not overwhelmingly amazing, but pretty good.  Though they were on the expensive side of things.  I even then went to regular monthly service because one of the girls was really sweet and I felt comfortable with her in my home.  Then they sold the business and it went under new ownership.  Yikes.  Not great.  All of the maids starting changing, there was never any consistency as to who would show up.  They were often late or came at a completely different time than they were originally supposed to.  The rates went up.  The last time I tried to use them, I had called saying I needed to schedule a cleaning that week because I had people coming over to the house.  My call was never returned.  There's not even a business mailbox set up, it's just a cell phone voicemail, which I think the owner uses as her personal phone too.  I think I was called back by them at one point (not sure) but they just asked me who called them from my number (not identifying themselves personally or as a business).  It's just weird and unprofessional.  I just scheduled with a different cleaning company that has fantastic reviews on Yelp (Wave House Cleaning Company).  You call them and they actually answer as a business.  They were easy to set up with and their prices are much much better than AZ Maid Beautiful ($134.99 for a deep cleaning of a 3br, 2ba house, 1750 sqft... whereas at AZ Maid it's $185), so we'll see how it goes.

The waitstaff is really friendly and accommodating. The restaurant itself had a nice, casual atmosphere. And the food is good and they have tofu and vegetable options for every single dish, so it's easy if you're a vegetarian. Also, the prices are reasonable and the service is pretty quick. We'll definitely be back.

These guys deserve their high rating.  I tried them after dealing with a few cleaning services in the valley, and working for a while with AZ Maid Beautiful (which I don't recommend).  I had in-laws coming into town though and I hadn't as much as dusted or vacuumed in many moons.  I thought I'd give them a go, called and scheduled and was happy to hear that for a deep cleaning, it'd be $135 (we were paying AZ Maid Beautiful considerably more).    The cleaners showed up basically on time, about 15 minutes late, no big deal.  I can no more simply state that they did an incredible job.  Everything I thought would be done got done, plus stuff I didn't expect (like dusting on top of the fridge, cleaning the inside of the ovens).  I had to leave before they were done (they cleaned for like 4.5 hours), so I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to check the house after they finished.  But when I got home I was very pleased with everything.  Baseboards were clean, all the ceiling fans and lamp shades were clean, mirrors and windows were sparkling.  And the windows (inside) were extra, but only $14.  And they wet dusted the blinds for $25.  MUCH better than the $45 I paid AZ Maid Beautiful to wet dust the blinds, and the blinds look a billion times better than when they did it.  So my experience was that they provided a very high quality cleaning service with for a very competitive price resulting in a really great value.  I'd hire them again in a heart beat.  Keep up the high standards Wave House Cleaning, I'll keep coming back.

My review is based solely on the hard work and cleaning skills of Suzy. So my experience wasn't unblemished. For some reason, they only sent one poor girl, Suzy, to deep clean my 1800 sqft house when I said in the notes that it was a moving clean. When a house is empty, you may have less to dust without furniture, but way more to clean. So I'm not sure why the scheduler chose to do that, on the scheduling/office end of things I wasn't very happy. And the girl called to explain why it "shouldn't take that long and didn't need two people" despite the reality of the situation. Suzy had even called and texted asking them to send another person to help.  However, Suzy was a sweet girl and worked her butt off to get as much done as she could. She was cleaning frantically. I helped because we were showing the house that evening, and needs must. She wasn't able to get it finished, but bless her, she stayed well after she had to and even though it was her daughter's first day of school, she stayed the course and really gave it her all. Would definitely love to have a cleaner like her again. She did a great job and really just worked herself to the bone.  So the cleaner was great. The scheduling, not so great. I've never had any company, including this one which I've used before, send less than two people for a deep clean.

I also bought a voucher from Living Social for 3 man hours of cleaning.  I've called numerous times, but the voicemail just goes to a generic voicemail box.  There's not even any indication of this being a real business.  The website listed was also defunct and just redirected to the company that sells websites.    I called Living Social to get my money back.  The girl I spoke with said she recalled helping someone else who had problems with this same company.  Living Social did refund my money.  They offered to try to work with the company to "resolve my issues", I said though that with how sketchy this was, I'd just rather not have them in my home.  She said that occasionally a company they'll work with does get overwhelmed with the influx of business.  But it seems to me they should put a cap on the number of vouchers they offer then.    At any rate, this company is at best unreliable and unprofessional.  At worst, it's a scam.  Either way, I don't think I'll be recommending them to anyone I don't hate.

I love the Pawtique. It is such a great model, to have rescue animals available for adoption instead of pet stores peddling puppy mill dogs. For people who don't know about adoption and rescue, it's a fantastic resource.  The Pawtique is really clean. There are great volunteers who are helpful and friendly. And lots of really sweet cats, dogs, puppies and kittens. Plus they have some beds, clothing and other accessories for pets.  I read the negative comment about the treadmill. No offense, but it's clearly from someone who has no experience with training a dog to use a treadmill. Which is ok to not have experience, but not ok to make snap judgements without the experience.    First of all, all dogs, just like people, need exercise to be healthy. It's not just for overweight animals (though it is a great option for that). We have a boxer bulldog mix that is a rescue and for her first two years was extremely high energy. She was/is in great physical shape.  But without an outlet for her energy, she was destructive in the house (digging up plants, chewing things in and out of the house from electrical cords to furniture, clothing and papers).  This is another reason that many dogs NEED exercise.  My husband and I run with her, but during the summer, especially since she has a snub nose, it's just far too hot for her to run outside. So we trained her to use a dog-specific treadmill. It is a process to train them. They are usually scared or uncomfortable with it at first, and you do a lot of short duration trials using treats as motivation. Some dogs take to it better than others, our corgi took to it straight away and loved it. They would have been doing a demonstration at the Pawtique for educational purposes to help people who were interested in this option and show how it's done. Which is really useful for people. Sadly, I think this girl missed the point and instead of engaging with them and asking questions, she made a snap judgement about what she was looking at. I know the staff and volunteers there have always been very open with me and my questions, so I hope that in the future people will ask questions.  Anyway, it's a great place. I'd LOVE to see this model adopted elsewhere (heck, everywhere!!) to put an end to puppy mills and encourage more people to adopt, which saves lives. Visit Pawtique if you haven't!
