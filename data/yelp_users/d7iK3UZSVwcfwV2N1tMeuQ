Solid, high-end restaurant/bar but with the aptly named "tavern" ambience.

I live near this place and its the best place to take visitors!  They make it extra special, and have a good happy hour.

"She's new, go easy on her" said the other waitress. An hour-and-half later, the food we ordered was delivered--but not all at once... to our party of nine. The food was typical for a bar so my 2 stars ought not reflect upon that.   The only redeeming quality of this place is that it had no sign prohibiting firearms.

I do all my own engine work (except oil changes because that's a waste of my time) but I have no idea how to do body work.   I assumed body shops are out to bilk us out of my money, but I took a chance on sending them my black Ford Contour SVT that had smashed doors and bumper.   These guys obviously aren't computer guys cuz they have a really lame website, but I'll say this:  Apparently they're from the 50's when it was common to return items to the owner in better-than-new condition.  I've never seen my car so beautiful--glossy black and impeccable--even better than when I bought the car used.  The owner actually picked up my car, got his mechanic to get it running again, did whatever those body workers do, and then delivered it back to my house.  Compared to the other estimates I got from dealers and another south Scottsdale body shop, he did all this for like 30% less.

I highly recommend these guys.  I normally change my own oil but haven't had time in the past couple months.  They did it in less than 10 minutes for the cheapest price I could find--I have no idea how they beat Wal-Mart's price, but more power to 'em!

My jet boat has been patiently waiting for me to fix it for about a year now.  Yesterday was the day, but lo! There was a swarming bee hive inside the gunwales and under the engine hatch.    Combat Bugs came today right on time and took care of the bee removal.  They have been here before to remove another beehive, so this was my second experience with them.  They recommended that if I keep the boats sitting for an extended period, that I put pieces of "Hot Shot" available @Home Depot in a couple spots inside the boat.  They are friendly, professional, no-nonsense, and experienced.  The service cost $95 and comes with a 3-month guarantee.  UPDATE 9/30/10:  About 100 bees from a different hive came back to retrieve the honey and the honeycomb that they couldn't initially see inside the boat.  Combat Bugs came back to kill the bugs on guarantee, but bear in mind that "bee removal" and "honey removal" are two separate charges.  Bee removal is $95 and Honey removal is around $200.  I'm taking away one star because the worker didn't notice the huge amount of remaining honey on his first visit.

Location. Location. Location.  ...and then you gotta have good food.  Well this snazzy-yet-inexpensive restaurant served me up the best breakfast I've had outside mom's Sunday fare, for an astonishingly low price.  Not greasy, carefully pan-cooked seasoned potatos and scrambled eggs, and yup, toast CAN be that good.  On approach I thought I was going to an East Coast Panera Bread, or a friendly neighborhood albeit overpriced Paradise Bakery, but then I open the doors to a cavernous living room with a baking problem.    And if anyone from Wildflower is reading this, can you fix the annoyingly tippy table we sat at outside with one leg missing the rubber pad?  ***UPDATE: Table was fixed promptly the next day!***  Also, they bus the tables there, so just leave your plate where it is when you leave.

Had lunch delivered to the office today.  It was a half-hour late.  The meatball sub was decent but squished. The $5 cookie was blackened and burnt.  I'm embarrassed for them.

Just bought the new 9mm Glock 19 Generation IV from this shop that opened last year. Best price I could find in the Valley, even though it was quite a drive to Cave Creek. They also have 30-rd Glock magazines and a ton of gun accessories. I saw quite a bit of AR, 1911, and AK guns and parts while I was there. I had a feeding problem with one the 30-rd mags, and they immediately exchanged it, no questions asked.
