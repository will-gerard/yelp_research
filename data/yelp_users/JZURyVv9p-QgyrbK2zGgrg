I had a plan today- go to a highly rated coffee house and watch the sun rise... came across Coffee Rush and thought "Sunrise over the lake? Yes!"  However, what I came to was a crapshoot. I arrived at 5:35am to what seemed promising. There was a greasy barista talking to a customer in the lobby. What I came to find later that it was a greasy barista who was smoking and drinking his own coffee but saw me park and ran inside.  I got a latte with extra foam. There was no offer of for here ware (boo) and there was no latte art (double boo) and the foam was super bubbly (triple boo).  My plan was to get 15 pastries to take to work. THe barista shook his head against it. They don't make themm there and they are all saran wrapped from the day before when they come in. (quadruple boo?)  Greasy (who also had a ccent) took my payment (cash), gave me my change and then continued making my drink. No attempted hand washing or anything. Not even purell.  I walked out to the lake to a bunch of dirty tables and left. Greasy came outside to grab his coffee and lighter because some other customers were coming. Ew to you Coffee Rush!

This Hilton is legit. It is on a one-way street right on the lake. 2 establishments are inside. There is the Olive Lounge which is a bar in the lobby and then the chophouse which is a restaurant at the very front of the hotel.  I normally book the top floor corner room however it was unavailable at the time of check-in. I opted for a middle floor corner room with the lake view. We were very surprised at how quiet our room was even though there were 14 weddings on the terrace that weekend. The lake views were great! Our room was very bag with the fridge and lots of windows. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom had great counter space.  Since it is so close to the capital building, there is lots of things to do. They have valet parking for $20 a night or self parking for $17 a night.   Cons were all detail related: The bathroom fan did not work, The caulking in the bathroom was extremely sloppy, The windows did not open & the valet left the keys in the car so often there were other people in our car mistakenly when we were trying to leave (all rentals look the same).  They allow pets and have a little welcoming for them at the entrance. I felt like overall this was a classy hotel and I would definitely stay here again.

This is one of the only sit down establishments in the Las Vegas C terminal. The main draw is the bar - it is Jose Cuervo after all. If you would like food, I can only explain it as a sit down Taco Bell, except the quessadilla is $14 instead of $2.  The patrons here are the worst part. They are either too drunk, too sad, too happy or confused. If you are a poor weary traveller stuck on a layover here and want to sit down, I am sorry.  The guacamole and chips here is $10. Again, this is a Taco Bell - so picture Taco Bell guac.... yes, it's green but you question if it has avocado in it.... that's Jose Cuervo Taqileria.

This review is for brunch. They started doing brunch a couple months ago and have not worked out the kinks. They had 2 for 1 mimosas so we tried it.  They do not have coffee.   The menu was limited but enough to choose from. They had chorizo biscuits and gravy on jalape√±o biscuits. They had sandwiches and dessert on the brunch menu. The bread pudding looked good but was chewy and tasted microwaved.  They did not have soap in the bathroom. When I asked for soap they said someone probably stole it. Gross. Where are the employees washing up?  There is some patio seating. I would not come here.

I like the Arizona Biltmore. It is looking a little run down right now - like they are down their maintenance supervisor - but overall I am a fan.  The Biltmore is a historic and artsy place. It has beautiful grounds and pools, firepits, coffee shop and clothing retail.   The regular (classic) rooms run around $400 a night plus a $28 a night resort fee. Ubers are abundant so you can forgo the car rental. There are golf courses on site if you are into that.  They also have an onsite spa- $150 for a 50 min massage.  The Biltmore is a Hilton Waldorf Astoria. They have some more modern rooms now which I stayed in as well as cottages and suites.   I will be back!

Frank & Alberts is on-site at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel so you're probably coming here because your company is paying for your room and you don't have a car.  Lucky for you it's delicious. Service was great, food was great, drinks were great so everything is great.  When I was in my room I noticed that they had a short rib mac & cheese on the room service menu. I got a hankering for this mac & cheese so when we came to the restaurant to eat I expected it to be on the menu, however it was not. Guess what? They made it for me anyway. It was delicious.  The cheesecake is made in house and I highly recommend it. You should come here.

Frost was great. I like good customer service and they were very patient. Frost makes you feel like you are fancy and healthy with all the gelato propaganda.   There is always a line- even on a cold night. There are alot of flavors but you can try as many as you like. The hazelnut choco is very much like nutella. The fruit flavors are sweet and fresh. I also like that they give everyone a cookie in the icecream.   I would come here again. I can see why its popular.

Crudo is amazing. Best place to eat in Phoenix. I did the 3 course meal. The ahi plate was small but incredible. I also tried the butterfish and yellowtail plate but you can't beat the ahi.  I had the gnochitti fig plate which was amazing as well as the short rib plate.  The apple desert was my favorite of the 3 offered. Crudo was lare and could accomadate large parties.

I had a flight delay and wandered around until the pastry case caught my eye. I ordered the smoked salmon salad. It was pre arranged. I was shocked at how amazingly delicious it was. I want to fly back just to eat it again.  I got two cupcakes for dessert (because that's how I roll) and they were not as impressive. I had red velvet and coconut and both were bland and dry.  Next time I will try a scoop of gelato. I miss you salad....

Eastwind is great. I have been to places with the $4 sushi boats that float around but this conveyer system is different. They are 2 piece sashimi or 3-4 piece rolls and ALL the plates are $2!  What a deal. You get so much more variety and there is no waiting!   There is a crowns plaza hotel and shops across the street so there is a lot of demand for parking. Worst case scenario you park at the hotel.  Sushi was great. I had no complaints. Refilled drinks whenever they were low and they were busy. You could eat here on a 10 minute break since you don't have to wait to order.

Latte art at the aiport?! Yup!  Cartel in is the C terminal. Middle Cs. Southwest.  They have delish pastries, brownies and cookies and well as perfect coffee.  There is a bar hightop to sit at, but other than that, it is a small to go place. There is a Starbucks nearby but you can't beat Cartel. Plus, it sounds dangerous.

The Nook Kitchen is a small spot in Phoenix. They were very accomadating when we came with a group of 8.   The menu is slightly fancy, but affordable. I really enjoyed the scallops - maybe the best scallop plate I have ever had. The apple crisp dessert and affogato dessert were amazing as well.  I ubered here so I can't speak to parking. I would come here again.

I was pretty shocked at this Marshall's. it is next to Sprouts off Ray Rd. the brands here were Nordstrom Rack status. They are so fancy they have a guard by the door!  It's cool to have a random really nice Marshall's that you can shop. There is a Rack and TJ Maxx nearby.  I will def come here again when I am in Phoenix or Chandler. Yay!

So I am at the Phoenix Airport. I go through the Business class line and get a hankering for ice cream. I am an hour and a half early and no one is in my line. I yelp what to do next.... I see there is a highly rated creamery in terminal B. I am in Terminal C. That sounds close, right?  Nope.  10 minutes of walkways later I arrive. It is tiny but mighty. There are many freshy creamed ices and smells of waffle cones waft from the entry. I got the espresso and prailine. They were both delish. I finished my entire 2 scoops before I got back to my terminal. The C terminal is Southwest and the B terminal is American/US AIrways. Because it was great and I had a craving, it was worth the walk. The price was very good for such great ice cream.
