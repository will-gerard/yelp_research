James is the Jedi master of pool repair! Seriously, his knowledge of how a pool system operates and how to repair them is unsurpassed. He has fixed my pool issues for years and always has been top notch. He most recently diagnosed and fixed a problem with my pool over the phone!! (When my weekly pool guy said that issue would probably cost me over a thousand dollars). James is a stand up guy and we highly recommend him.

Ten members of my family made reservations for Sunday brunch today for mother's day! Horrible experience for service and especially the food! First off for 35 dollars per person their hardly was any food out, and what was out was dried out and hardly edible. So right off the bat 3 people in our party decided against doing the brunch because of how bad it looked so they ordered from the menu. I would love to tell you how that was but they never received their food. The rest of us still tried the brunch because the waitress promised more food...nothing got better even down to not having any plates. They weren't even busy so I don't know what happened with that. Worst part was we told the waitress how we felt and I'm sure she could see how displeased we were and didn't even offer to make things right...so after 230.00 Bill we left hungry and angry. By the way at least 2 different customers were nodding their head and felt how we did...do yourself a favor pay 10 bucks more and hit up the Phoenician for mother's day brunch.

Just tried this place for take out. We ordered pizza for the kids ,cheese steak sandwich for me and the Italian sandwich for my wife. We were very happy with our meals. I have never had a cheese steak in Philadelphia..yet but I imagine it would taste like the one I just ate. Best I have had so far. We will be going back
