For this Thanksgiving get together, we actually had a little drama. Unfortunately, I was the focus. Fortunately, I was quickly taken away by the Osso Bucco which was delicious and succulent in a tasty broth. A small fork was provided for digging out the marrow but was really needed was an anteater tongue or large sledgehammer to slurp up every morsel of marrow.  The Calamari starter was tender and perfectly seasoned. The maragarita goblets are fantastic old school bar cocktails and 2 were sufficient to make anyone happy. Come bring some family drama with some calamari, osso bucco, and cocktails for a great evening.

Quick and speedy and we got what we reserved. GREAT! Highly recommend getting a GPS; IMMENSE help in the spread out metropolis. Switching drivers was even easy at the return desk. Friendly helpful staff to get you going. Spend the extra for the GPS.

Get your walking shoes on this airport is pretty spread out without the aid of people movers. Also compared to newer updated airports, there are no power ports and the WiFi never connected on my laptop but worked on my iPhone. The airport needs some good upgrading in the near future. Bonus for not loosing my luggage and pick up and drop off locations are convenient and there are a ton of stores and eating places where you could easily have a 24 hr layover and never run out of food options. I noticed they had little museums scattered about the airport and it would have been fun to look at all of them if I had time. Security was quick and prompt and this is the first time I had the full body scan... I made sure to suck in my gut and flex.

We stayed here on business and initially the first two of us checked in without a hitch but the last two of us the hotel gave the rooms away even though they had a reservation. The hotel did compensate for the mistake with another hotel but there was a lot of hassle that should not have been. The room itself was clean and pretty standard, the water was hot, internet was good and we got a breakfast and happy hour cocktail. The breakfast is hot, bacon, eggs, potato buffett and a waffle maker; for the price of the room I would have expected a better breakfast like Quality Inn. Not planning to stay here again with so many other options.

When you need a tool for installing solar panels, this sears is pretty good. The staff are helpful and friendly and the tool department is HUGE... compared the ones we have here. They had a great selection and we spent over 500$ on stuff..

They had what i was looking for ... it wasn't easy to find but after asking 3 people I eventually found it. A folding table and shelving. The place is typically big and laid out like most other home depots. Know what to expect when you go and you won't be disappointed but if you want a lot of personal service stick to a local hardware store.

Oh, the old days of ice cream parlors is alive and well here at Mary's. The large booths fit our entire family and some weird concoctions of ice cream and flavors were ordered by the kids. My sister likes to load up her kids on sugar and this place does not disappoint. I had a simple sundae and was very happy with the toppings and sauce. During the Christmas holiday there is a massive display of cotton and figurines. Looking forward to visiting again the next holiday I am in town. Kind of sad that there are all these little islands of success surrounded by vacant lots of abysmal failures.

This review is just for the bazookie dessert, cookie with ice cream. It was such a whirlwind evening I don't even recall seeing this on the menu before it showed up at our table. As we pulled up into the lot right before they were closing we ordered 2 of these and quickly, illegally parked to devour our dessert. Imagine warm succulent cookie dough, crispy crust on the outside, warm gooey in the middle, and just cold ice cream floating on top. Orgasmic Heaven!! when is this coming to California?!?! Oh, the staff is warm and friendly and treats you like family even when they are about to close. Go!

Great rock scrambling!! I did feel a little wimpy when people were running what I am hiking... how sad. Love it for the easy access... except for the parking situation that sucks! And, since it is about the only major hill not many options.

In comparison to Sushi I can get here in the Bay Area, this was ok. The sashimi was fresh but the cuts were small for the price. The miso, served with a soup spoon?!?, is way to salty and powdery... they need to lighten up on the mix. We had maguro sashimi(small, $$$), unagi, hamachi, spicy scallop (very good, special order), tempura(batter was too thick and a little soggy), nigori sake (nice touch served in a bamboo thing. The place is loud; the staff are gorgeous; the atmosphere is fun. I would go back for drinks and an app but for real sushi i would wait until i got home.

Where do you bring your family of 16 when no one can figure out what they want? Here!! There is something for everyone on their extensive but limited menu and they can piece together any combination of sauce or pasta to satisfy any picky eater. My rowdy family ordered nearly the entire menu and the staff helped corral all of us and arrange the tables so we could all sit together. Definitely this was a very amiable and delicious restaurant where I am sure we will visit again.

What a fantastic park. I wish I had my mountain bike but hiking with non-hikers and a small 5 year old we were very limited in what we could explore. From the couple of bikers and hikers though this place was perfect for a simple kid friendly hike. We did get to see a road runner.

I want to go back in time so that I could be a kid today. This kicks butt over having to climb a sap covered pine tree or play on the rusted concrete and steel jungle gym of yesteryears. Everything is super safe here and well thought out for maximum kid engagement. Love it!!! Chasing a small one about the museum was a blast but my knees sure took a beating. Practice your bear crawls before coming here. The tree is a great starting point and then we skipped to the 3rd floor for some more running about and then bailed to eat out at the Phoenix Market and came back to explore the 2nd floor and the outdoor patio. I can't imagine going into the outdoor tube in the summer but in November it was very pleasant. The dining area had the basics but we did not feel like exploring that option. This place is definitely a solid day for the kids and the adults that can contort themselves enough to follow them. Definitely on the list for our next outing.

Hey you guys want a zero star walmart come to our mountain view walmart. This mega Walmart is fantastic! Honestly where else do you go on Thanksgiving to get cold medicine, eggs, avocado and prune juice. The blocks long store has everything you could want or need or don't need.

Amazingly delicious. I had the chicken and 2 sides and left wanting more. The portions are on the slender side but good for not feeling stuffed at the end of my meal. The fries are great but a little more generous helping... come on it is a potato. The chicken was finger licking sticky good. I could have devoured a whole bird easily... darn organic birds are soo petite. Bring on the GMO chicken the size of Godzilla with breasts as big as Texas. I would definitely come back for the chicken. We didn't try any of the baked goods but the cinnamon roll had a fedora of sweet tooth glazing that was begging to be eaten.
