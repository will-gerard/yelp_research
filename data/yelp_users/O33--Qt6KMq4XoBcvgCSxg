This location is awesome! The service is awesome! It may be a little small but that also means not very many people come to this one. It's also in and out when I go this location. And there's a Walmart right beside it!!

So sad that is the closest Walmart to me! It's  pretty dirty here. The makeup department is closed off because you have people stealing!

This location is pretty big! Two levels. The staff is usually nice, they greet you and help you as well. My only probably is that this place is ALWAYS a mess. All their things are every where. Other than that I don't mind going to this location.

This place is okay! We are close to west gate & they have a theatre so not many people come to this one it seems. It's clean! Just a little small.

The food is yummy! The bowl servings are pretty big, the bread they bring out (for free) is so fresh! The service is good, & food comes out fast, even when busy.

Little hidden gem in Glendale. Love this place, it's a great authentic hole in the wall place to have Korean food. The price is decent. They aren't open on Sunday though.  They close pretty early too, but still it's very delicious! It's our little spot that we like to share when we have company.

Ok, so this is literally thee best Korean joint I have found in Phoenix. When you walk in it's like you're in Korea! The lady was kind to us & taught us how to eat the food the right way. She even served us, as in put food into our mouth (it wasn't that weird lol)  If you like authentic, this is the place!  4 stars because the food was da bomb!! & because I killed a roach in the bathroom! it was a small baby one, & in the bathroom (who's never seen a roach in a bathroom right?).    It's our little hole in the wall gem!

I love this place! So many workers! So many seats! Very affordable prices! The hot stone massages are great! They even will bring u free water & snacks & coffee while getting your nails done! So many colors & services. The owners daughter is usually the receptionist when I go there & she is super nice!

I will only give this place a one star because of the guy up front (receptionist). First off the setting was kind of sketchy, I didn't like how they had clothes lines with curtains to separate the you from other costumers. The ladies in there didn't have respect for customers. They kept giggling and talking to each other. The girl that I had was VERYY LAZY about the massage. There was no pressure, as if she was just touching/ rubbing my skin. I asked her to apply more pressure kindly and she starting talking away with the other workers. Out of the 60 mins I would say only half the time she was actually "massaging". The other half she would walk out of the room to go & "grab something, or wash her hands. We'll I guess you get what you pay for...$25 but it felt like it should of been free honestly, I could of done better myself... Super disappointed. Just a waste of time and money..

If I could give this place a ZERO star rating I would!!!  The customer service sucks so bad, the workers made me feel like I didn't want to be there. I came in with two bags full of very good condition, some even w tags clothes but only wanted to buy a pair of sandals, new with tags, never used, ( I couldn't return, I lost my receipt) clearly said $30.99 on it & they offered me $3!! & in return they would sell it $20?!!? Hell no.  All the clothes there are over priced! You might as well buy your stuff new! People don't waste your time here, they seriously make you feel so uncomfortable. They are not welcoming, they will snob you. And it smells bad. They look at you and act as if this job is sooo important. They rob you of what you have and bank off of it. I'm just warning you . This store sucks.

I will say that the Thai Tea is the best I've had in Phoenix! The food is on the play side. The pad Thai wasn't the best the noodles were super sticky, I couldn't separate them at all. The Thai fried rice was delicious. & the beef yellow curry was on point!

My car feels and looks amazing! Danny seems like such a down to earth real guy. He's easy to talk to, he doesn't pressure you into getting the tint you don't want. He supports the troops and gave us a little discount. This place is legit everybody. The process was very easy. We dropped out car off in the morning and picked it up by noon with it detailed & all

Little great spot! My first time there today the owner(?) was very nice! She helped us with what was best and least popular. She even was nice to my kids. The boba is good the shaved ice was amazing!! Definitely will be back even with distance in the way.

I've been staying in these apartments for a little over 6 months now, & I really want to give a review only now because I have a few good things  I wanna say! Fist off when we moved here we were helped with open hands! This is our first apartment in the U.S.  & didn't really now requirement and all. We were shown 2 display apartments the same day, we were given many different quotes and options on which apartment best fit us (upon price and what layout and floor). Our apartment is the 2 bed 2 bath & with bigger living room space. The balcony is pretty big too!  So we have a dog and one day my husband was walking our dog, one of the workers saw him picking up after our dog, thanked him and gave him a $15 subway gift card! Pretty cool!  They always update us with upcoming events! They hide golden eggs on Easter and have prizes! They do balcony competition for Xmas!  They even do movies at the main pool!  They have a playground with sand!  &&& THIS IS THE ONLY REASON I GIVE 4 STARS!! - because of the playground! I have two kids who love to play at the playground, but just can't!!! Because people will take their dogs there and let them poop and not pick it up!! During the summer its too hot to even play on the jungle gym. It needs a canopy!! & a gate that doesn't allow dog inside!!  But, the gym is awesome, the dog park (gated) is awesome. The inside of the apartments are awesome! Super nice and up to date! The ac is nice and cold. The location is good too! 5 minutes from tanger outlet and west gate. Less than 5 mins to the 101.  10 mins from the military base!  They have garages so they clean up all the time!  I will be staying here for a while !

I have been going to this location for about 2-3 months now & I cannot even stress how awesome it is!!! The staff is the best! The receptionist are so nice and welcoming, they always have a smile on, which I love.  The actual clinic is very clean. I have seen 3 Chiropractic Docs there, they were all very helpful and knowledgable, but my favorite is Dr. Shay!! She is too good! She always fixes me up! This is the spot to go to, it's affordable and they really do help fix you up.

I'm a little nervous about eating here. I ordered 3 bento lunch specials & all were served to us less than 5 mins after ordering. Ummmm that didn't seem right to me. The costumer service was good though. I hate to say it but the Chicken and beef teriyaki tasted super fake!! Not even joking. The sushi was decent, the cups weren't washed good. I'm scared I might of ate something else beside chicken and beef :/ I'm preparing myself for some type of food poisoning.

I am a pizza lover like most people! And like like people who eat pizza they feel a bit guilty after eating it, but not here!!! I never ever feel guilty eating a whole pie to myself (& I do, every time I eat here). The staff is okay, they are friendly for the most part, the location is good too. The food though, omg the food is amazing!!!! Salads to pizza is da bomb!!  & they also support the troops, so don't hesitate to ask!
