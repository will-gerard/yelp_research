Hitting a casino or six is just part of the Spring Training ritual for my dad and I. We've been to casino's all over the Phoenix area, but this is the only one that I'd recommend. Great facility, friendly dealers, and lots of variety in the slots side of the house.

Joined a friend (who lives locally) and his family here for dinner last night. Can't imagine a better experience! Gorgeous patio, casual vibe, family-friendly, great service, and AMAZING food!  The antipasto salad was compact in size, but incredibly flavorful. The pizza (we had the pesto/sausage/gorgonzola on a whole wheat thin-crust) was fantastic. We had a total of four kids between us, and they each had a different pasta dish, all cooked perfectly. The warm cookie with vanilla ice cream for dessert was the perfect finish. Our little girl was asleep before we got her buckled into the car seat!  Can't wait to go back!

Well, the remodel is complete, but I think most of the budget was spent on improvements to the exterior of the property. Nothing special inside, and the room we spent our stay in was anything but a "suite". More like a railroad apartment, without doors to separate the bedroom from the living room. Bummer with a 2 year old.  Staff was friendly and accommodating, but if we had it to do over again, we'd have opted for a place with some doors (and a little more space).   Bed was just OK, comfort-wise.

If you've contracted some kind of horrible respiratory disease that can only be mitigated by high temperatures and arid climates, I guess I'm happy that you can watch live major league baseball. Other than that, I have a hard time thinking of nice things to say about the AZ Diamondbacks' home venue. Not sure which  I find most annoying, the southwestern teal motif, or the fans who seem to be more interested in the A/C unit that cools the place than the quality of baseball that's being played in it.   Check this one off the list. AZ is for Spring Training baseball.

I'm here for the first time at a conference. Conference stays don't always afford guests the opportunity to fully explore the amenities, but this much I can say for sure... there's only so much you can do to make people comfortable when it's closing in on 110 degrees outside!   Lovely property, "lazy river", quality restaurants, and friendly staff. Rooms are nothing to write home about (nice, but nothing too out of the ordinary). Close enough to all types of shopping, movies, and bars/restaurants, in case you feel the need to leave the resort. One piece of advice--park close, or pay for valet. Walking to your car mid-day can be a life-altering experience. I swear I saw a mirage as I was walking in from the parking lot yesterday!

Simply outstanding park, with a breathtaking view of the Pittsburgh skyline and the Roberto Clemente Bridge. Everything about this park is spot on, but my favorite feature is the "out of town" scoreboard, which features runners on base, as well as at bat and pitcher details. Ideal.

Outstanding Spring Training locale. Padres share this facility with the Mariners, and the folks who staff the place during spring baseball are some of the nicest folks you'll ever meet. Lots of practice fields, and access to players. If you're an autograph seeker, or just a fan of the game, this is a really unique (and at times surreal) experience. Great for young kids.  The fare at this park is the best of all spring training locations. They've got it all, and the layout is much more family-friendly than other parks. Lots of grass, shaded dining areas, and fun stuff for kids to play on/around.

Big  "$5.99 CAR WASH" banner with lots of small print at curbside should have been warning enough, but after driving nearly 400 miles to see some Spring Training baseball last weekend, my truck was covered in bugs, and I didn't think the cheap wash would get it anywhere near clean, so I pull in (after driving by about six "do it yourself" places).   Greeted by a slick salesman, wearing a company polo shirt. He's got the ticket in hand, and I select the $21.99 wash (figuring that paying for the upgraded wash will warrant the extra time my bug-covered truck would require). He asks if I want a wax, and I explain that I don't have time. He asks how much time I've got, and I tell him that we're headed to a game, and that I only have time for the wash. He exclaims that a wax would only take 25 minutes, total, which I quickly dismiss as fiction and explain that I just want whatever comes with the $21.99 wash. He then shifts to a choice of leather treatment for the interior, explaining that I've got a choice of Armor All, or some other cleaner. I say "dealer's choice", hoping to expedite the process, but he continues the inquisition, this time talking up some wheel-related upgrade. At this point, I exit the vehicle, explain for the the fourth time that I just want the $21.99 service, and request my ticket.   Lo and behold, my path is immediately intercepted by the auto glass repair dude, who wants to fix a chip he's identified in my windshield (how he could identify anything though all the bug guts is beyond me!) A simple no is not enough with this guy either, so he follows me for a few steps, extolling the virtues of his services before I disappear into the office to pay for my wash.   I assume (wrongly) that I'm out of the high-pressure zone, when the cashier explains that "today's wash could be free" if I just purchase a handful of future washes. At this point, I'm speechless, and just hand her my money while smiling and slowly shaking my head "no".  Sad, methinks, because these guys do pretty good work. They are only the second car wash I've ever been to that uses air hoses to flush water out of all the seams of your car body and windows (preventing streaking, which, with my black truck, negates the value of a wash almost every time.)  Note to ownership/management: Tap the brakes on the hard sell. Restructure the bonus program, and/or eliminate the commission piece. Partner with some of the high school groups that were promoting their own car washes all over the area this weekend, and give them a percentage of your take. Worst case, you'll build some goodwill with a group of future drivers (high school students). Best case, you'll also turn on a whole new group of customers to your quality washes. Judging by lack of business you were doing when I was there (Saturday morning = key business hours), you don't have much to lose!

After ten years of Spring Training in the Phoenix area, my dad and I have scaled back on the exploration of new breakfast joints. Chompies has a great menu, friendly service, and the food quality is consistently good. It's no DZ Akin's, but it's the closest thing we've found in our many visits.
