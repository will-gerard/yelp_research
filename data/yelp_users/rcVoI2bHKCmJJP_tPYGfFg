I have been here twice now and the first time i asked for no pickles i still ended up with them on my sandwich, after making them aware they then handed me a sandwich with the pickles taken off by hand. Now on my second go round i ordered the same things only to be given a chicken sandwhich with a processed chicken patty they see of my palm which is not very big... overall disappointed with there service and the food has really gone down hill. DONT GO HERE

Wow. The waitress was completely distracted, inattentive me and some friends waited for a half hour for sandwiches. There was two waiters who were also bar tending and my sandwich was cold, the solution was putting the cold soggy sand which back on the grill so it was just mush... No empathy, no offer to correct it, I will not be back. What a shit show!

Hey Mrs. Robinson!   The Graduate was a fantastic choice. Gorgeous 70's vintage feel with that modern twist you would expect from a boutique style hotel I especially liked the convenience of the Normal Diner attached for a real breakfast treat!  I want to especially thank Mark for answering a million questions about the area and accommodating my every need. I will definitely  be recommending this place to anyone looking for extreme comfort, culture and delicious food!
