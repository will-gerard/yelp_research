Years past, Wild Thaiger was a moribund place serving bland, forgettable fare so I barely recognized it when our party of six stopped in last night for my mom's birthday.   White tablecloth, good cutlery, big wine glasses, open kitchen, spicy dishes presented with flair - I'm impressed! I had beef Kiewan, a delicious green curry that packed solid (American-gauge) heat. The corn fritters are crunchy and good, served with jalapenos and cucumber. The coconut milk-based soup with chicken was a hit around the table. Pork, beef, ribs, vegetarian, salmon - everything got a solid thumbs up.   Good drinks. Our server was first rate and unusually sweet. Maybe it's not cutting edge Scottsdale, but Wild Thaiger serves up tongue tingling food at fair prices in an attractive interior space.  They've stepped up, and if you're in the neighborhood, you should too.

The food was fine on my only visit to Blue Fin, when my son and I stopped in on a hot, off peak summer afternoon following a library assignment., but what  we remember most was the elderly Japanese lady who refilled our drinks, took several moments to chat, and repeatedly referred to my son as "Son". Or possibly "San" - I'm not entirely sure.   She just had a gentle grace about her, from another culture, and another era, that made a lasting impression on my teenager. That was three or four months ago, and he still brings her up every so often.   "Hey Dad. Remember that lady at Blue Fin?"  "What's that?"  Oh, who am I kidding.  She made an impression on me too.

Perhaps not the worst eatery in the galaxy but this place reminds me of Death. Cornerstones appear to be below average, oversalted Italian and slow, sometimes indifferent service.  Old folks abound, perhaps reassured by the gimmicky old tyme nostalgia, with the trolley, fake tiffany lamps, etc. Instead, it transports me to the 1970s, to sprawling east coast chains off the turnpike I'd get dragged to as a kid - with waits, bland food, very young staff going thru the motions, and crap on the walls to distract from the underlying mediocrity.   It's not horrible, and will appeal to that handful of Americans actually older than me, but I've little interest recapturing the sleepy era this factory is shooting for.

At 1 PM, we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices. Only one seafood entree (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.    Entrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a nice surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable. My fish had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.    It's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.  Service seemed friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt.   Judging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back. Two stars for the ceviche.

Three keys for adults to enjoy this particular zoo.   1. Arrive as early as possible - it's cooler, less crowded and the animals are more active.    2. Buy a membership - members may enter an hour prior to opening, when it's more 'cooler', more 'less crowded' and animals are more 'more active'.  The $45 package incl two guest admissions, complimentary Zoolights tix and a couple ride freebies in addtn to unlimited zoo admission.  Now I pop in for a jog or power walk at 7 or 8am, once a month or so, and feel like I really get my money's worth.    3. It helps if you like to quietly observe animals.  Sounds obvious, but there's no SeaWorldesque shows or truly iconic draws banging you over the head here, like Shamu, polar bears or giant pandas.  But there IS a blase anteater coexisting with a red wolf. A gymnastic young orangutan. Playful otters and all the cool cats. Baboons. Javalina and a 700 lb tortoise.  Bighorn sheep loping impossibly along slippery buttes.  Zebras that look like paintings, posing with giant Maribou storks.   Plenty to see, if animals interest you.  Arrive early, avoid summer.

Macayos is like Chuck E. Cheese without the games. Lots of kids running around. Young servers navigating first jobs with little supervision and varied results. Often bland or lukewarm food that takes an eternity to order and arrive.   At least at Chuck E Cheese, the kids can run around and bang gophers on the head, or whatever, while you're waiting. Here, you just kind of bang your own head on the table.

Five stars?  Eek.    I dont wanna get all highbrow here, but prospective diners probably shouldnt harbor illusions about a place charging $7 for a couple of chicken fried "steaks" big enough to flop over the edge of the plate.    Neither of us finished our cow patties and we both felt a little sick afterwards. Not violently ill or anything, just that bloated, greasy feeling culminating in a concise bout of diarrhea.    The service is ok and it's cheap, but in terms of food quality, there are half a dozen better restaurants within a hundred yards of this place - seven if you count Taco Bell.

This isnt the most imaginative Indian buffet, but I like it for several reasons. Reasonably tasty fare, pleasant buffet service and AYCE prices around $9-10, but what I really appreciate is the subdued and somewhat elegant atmosphere, just a quarter mile south of the big do on Camelback.   There's a ton of busy Camelback restaurants, but it seems the choice is often between fast food, pizza or pricey event dining in the Biltmore or Esplanade. Flavors of India provides a relaxing, comfortable middle ground - sit down dining with real china and stemware at very affordable prices. That fills a niche this area needs.    Everybody forgets this place is right around the corner. It's rarely crowded and there's something comforting about getting out of the sun and the bustle and settling into FOI's dark environs for a leisurely Indian meal. The drink service. The naan. Chafing dishes being replenished. It's a gentle rhythm that suits me and nothing seems hurried like the corporate factories up the street. The people here seem to appreciate that you went a little out of your way to stop in, too.  I always leave feeling I've gotten my money's worth, and frankly, a little rejuvenated.   If you live in Mesa, I dont recommend making a special trip to find FOI.  It's not that good. But if you're in the neighborhood, stressed out from shopping and traffic, it's a soothing alternative, a bit off the beaten path.

When Cheesecake introduced their monstrosity to the Biltmore years ago, I was turned off by breathless staff pushing drinks and skimpy desserts, and by longer waits than a GP's office in flu season. But I have to say that, over time, I've warmed to this conglomerate - even as I subsequentyly learned that eating here regularly might kill me.      The staff has settled in and mostly toned it down, and now our entire family revolves through CF's front door with confidence, and suspiciously early for dinner, to avoid waiting room rigor mortis.  Overall food preparation is at least one notch below Houston's across the street and one notch above adjacent CPK, which is more impressive than it sounds considering the legendary breadth of Cheesecake's menu.     It's all respectably prepared, if fattening, and often quite good.  I like the fish tacos (standard fish but massive fixins) and the portabella and asparagus omelette. Mom gravitates towards sublime corn tamale cakes, and Chris is seduced by a salad presented in two huge conical mounds he likes to call "Dolly Parton".    There's an item or two on this menu to pique anyone's interest, and while the Factory probably wont serve up your best meal ever (unless you dont get out much), a truly disappointing meal here is rarer than Steak tartare. Portions are large and we almost always pass on dessert.   Not the kind of restaurant to whip out an engagement ring in (this is a Factory, after all), but a safe choice for the family, stargazing (Suns opponents staying at the Ritz eat here all the time), or a pre-movie dinner date. Well, safe until you die.

Used to special order birthday cakes from Karsh's, but service and execution is consistently better at Barb's. Prices recently went up - my last custom quarter sheet ran about $70 -  but they'll make you a delicious cake that's a work of art or a fun conversation piece.   Not Charm Cty/Ace of Cakes "wow" factor, where money is no object, but these are experienced bakers who care about your satisfaction and who seem to enjoy a good challenge. They'll consult with you, discuss options, take the necessary time to get it right. I've always been pleased with their final interpretations.

Houston's Esplanade always did more things right than not, but it had also been declining, almost imperceptibly, since the nineties. Pricing consistently outstripped inflation, the kitchen's impressive attention to detail began to slip on a couple entrees, and for some time, they ceased reciting prices on heavily marked up and misleadingly touted "specials" .    Our first visit to Hillstone represented an acceleration of that decline.   The stone and glass prairie style building's very attractive inside and out, but I couldnt find the front door. Neither could a bunch of other drivers, circling the property. Maybe the architect feels this adds to one's sense of discovery, but I found sardining my way through an overcrowded megabar at the wrong end of the building, in order to locate the restaurant checkstand, to be an unwelcome pain in the ass.   Our table split an attractively plated $17 sushi sampler that was tasty, but we never got plates.  The food's always been quality and still is, but a vinagrette on the steak and noodle salad wasmore acidic than before, and a fish entree was described as "a little overcooked".  Other entrees were excellent, as before. A small quality step down from across the street.   Our server oozed a scripted, contemptuous charm, designed to inflate the bill and tip with every breath, yet provided less tangible service than I normally get in an IHOP.  Houston's staff, at times, could be stiff and occasionally obsequious - but never this agressively insincere or useless.  My water glass was empty almost half the evening.  We asked for a bottle that eventually arrived, so we could serve ourselves. That ran out too, and sat for ages.  We intended to split a dessert, but the waiter pushed so hard the whole table felt condescended to and we opted to skip it.    To my astonishment, not once during the meal were we solicited as to how our food was or if we required anything.  At least not while we were eating, when it might've mattered. That changed as soon as my wife lingered over coffee, in lieu of dessert, which prompted our starched white shirt to "inquire" if she didnt like it - evidently because her cup didnt empty fast enough to turn his next table.    It was that kind of evening. Overpriced (everything's gone up a buck or two). Shitty, ingratiating service masquerading as fine dining.  There are more suits now, Managing (something other than service, evidently) By Walking Around.  Booths are smaller, so that a quarter of my upscale table space now belongs to a condiment caddy.  The old dining room hummed with a muffled energy; this one's just loud, like a diner or Suns game.  We frequented Houston's since it opened in 1988. Hundreds of times. But we felt uncomfortable and, frankly, kinda played here.   We'll give it another chance this summer. Houston's was too good not to. But if anyone from Hillstone is reading this, let me share the best part of our evening. It was in the crowded foyer, waiting for a table - something I'm normally impatient with anyway  - moreso because my 79 year old mom had no place to sit. (It was a cold, New Years eve night and everyone was cramped inside).  But you've got that wonderful, busy kitchen counter right there, and my wife struck up a little conversation with one of your hard working grill men.  We recognized him from across the street and exchanged wishes for a Happy New Year. That was the only genuine, pleasant interaction we had with your overly groomed staff all night.

I'm not a vegetarian, but who can honestly resist any manner of hash slung by a CULT? A cult right around the corner!!!  You dont even have to travel to California.  I came in with a good attitude, ready to acknowledge ( if not worship outright) all appropriate deities - but left a bewildered non believer.    We endured baffling service, and it pains me to say it, because there was not a hint of rudeness. Just communication obstacles that I suspect involved more than language. To make a long story short, we had no idea what we ordered, despite numerous attempts to probe our waitress for such rudimentary information.  It was comic, really, until the food arrived.   My mother's Vietnamese entree was more a Greek tragedy of inedibly chewy mock chicken (she had asked several times for something easy to chew). Mine was better, but I've forgotten what it was.  The Seventh Heaven Salad was ok (more like third or fourth heaven) and we both liked the cup of complimentary chicken soup. That was a nice touch, and something we could all understand.   It took several minutes to communicate that we wanted a knife. I ordered  Thai iced tea, which unbeknownst to me was 'code' for ice water. It's hard to get too mad though.  Despite the confusion, it's about the cheapest sit down restaurant around.  People seemed nice, in an interplanetary way. We had what amounted to a disappointing pot luck, and the service was extraordinarily weird.   Bon appetit !!

There's nothing the least bit elegant about Pat's and it wont be your Aunt Pittypat's cup o' tea, but newer restaurants selling antiseptic, faux authenticity look positively silly next to this guy.  It's a gritty, cramped throwback more than a prototype concept you'd see up the street (ie Pei Wei, Sauce, etc).  At Pat's, you open the front door, and might as well be in Coney Island or Bensonhurst.  The claustrophobic walls burst with New York kitsch, old license plates and smartass signs not to be taken too seriously.  ( There used to be a witch at the front counter, but she's apparently been liquidated and the folks now are helpful and pleasant. )We normally take out, but if you do eat in, dont expect to be waited on at a table- order first at the counter and they'll bring it out to you.    Pies are consistently delicious; not wood fired Bianco artisan or anything, just straight out of the oven NY style thin crust by a paesan who knows what he's doin' - not some part-timer reading a Dominos manual. My teenager says this is the best pizza he's ever had. Having grown up in Brooklyn, I'd say it's the genuine article and way better than the chains. Good olive oil and, of course, the dough. Cant tell you why, but it just tastes different than the chains and you'll taste it in a second.    The other day, I walked in with two teenagers and we each got the daily lunch special - two large cheese slices and a soda. It was $9.72. Not $9.72 each.....$9.72 TOTAL!!  The three of us. Now, there's no sides - hell, there's no utensils other than your hands, napkins and chin - but when was the last time you sat down in an establishment with three adult sized appetites and  had a delicious, satisfying lunch for ten bucks?    It aint the Sistine Chapel, but how can you say anything bad about a place like that?

A long time ago, when I was in my twenties, and the Phoenix dining scene was barer than Lady Godiva, Carlos was a focal point for friends, co-workers and me. We'd get off our crappy little jobs, and gladly wait for a table to relish huge portions of "Mexican food" dripping with cheese.  This was the 80's and we thought it was pretty wonderful.    A great deal has changed in twenty years. I've gotten older and crabbier. William Shatner is cool again. And the local restaurant scene has exploded with dazzling variety and quality.      When I escorted my mom here on a recent rainy day, a rush of distant memories streamed back from young adulthood. Nothing had changed here in two decades. The restaurant interior looked exactly as I had remembered. Young diners off work, more absorbed in office politics than in their massive taco salads and chimichangas - just like we used to be.  And my food looked and tasted remarkably like it did eons ago.   None of this, dear reader, is a good thing.   Carlos O'Brien's, apparently stupified by its lucrative formula of white people phoning in bland Mexican food dripping with Monterey Jack, is stuck in a 1980's fern bar masking an even broader, unholier time warp.   The restaurant world has evolved, raised the bar, and it's abundantly clear nobody here gives a shit.    To wit, I ordered fish tacos, which arrived, inexplicably, with no sauce or condiments of any kind. Just fish and dry cabbage in a tortilla?  To her credit, our waitress, who was perfectly pleasant, asked if I wanted any "sauce".  Um, yeah. This high maintenance fussbudget also likes milk on his cornflakes and syrup on his goddam waffles; please go to the trouble of fetching me this delightful "sauce" of yours.     Well it would be, if it resembled any fish taco sauce I've encountered since the Carter administration. Instead, our server cheerfully lugs back a ramekin brimming with industrial strength tarter sauce which, on this drizzly day, could have doubled as roof patch.   I know what you're thinking. New waitress. I'm overreacting. Please bear with me. First,  she's not a new waitress. I overheard her gabbing with another table (friends of hers, I guess) about serving them on previous visits, so she's not new. This isnt about the waitress.   Second, I've never been served a dry fish taco in my life. No slaw dressing, not even a lime. Isnt this rather standard  preparation the kitchen's responsibility?   Third, this is one of the half dozen lunch combos CB's been slinging in their sleep every weekday for thirty years. Could've been an oversight, but there's no misunderstanding about some off the wall request.   Fourth, why would our waitress immediately ask if I wanted "sauce" unless she customarily served it  knowing the kitchen puts no sauce on the tacos? This isnt an oversight, it's business as usual.    I want to re-emphasize that our waitress was not difficult at all. I'm not panning Carlos because of any personality clash. I'm panning Carlos because they're so out of touch with diners' basic expectations  in 2008. I'm panning them because, on a corporate or management level (not a waitress or cook level), they dont give a crap about what comes out of their kitchen.    There was a time when Carlos O'Brien's held Phoenix in the palm of their cheese encrusted hands, but this maturing culinary burg has passed them by.

I call it "The Fast Lane".  The kids who work the drive thru here always get it right, are incredibly fast, and unfailingly courteous - without overdone spiels or orchestrated upsells. This is the best of the new (technology, efficiency) combined with the best of the old (steady, hardworking kids, unburdened by consultants  keen on turning them into obnoxious 'sales associates'.)  Understated, bedrock service.  Kudos to the mgr. Your guys and gals do a terrific job.

A fairly well realized monument to unabashed corporate card excess, Fleming's dutifully enables the expense account crowd.         Food and service are sporadic and a poor value for anyone silly enough to be spending their own money here. My wife's tuna steak looked pretty, but was tough and fibrous. Salmon was satisfactory, but I can make better at home.   Underlings fully invested in steak grunted unanimous satisfaction at the appropriate times.   A hostess and bartender were both pleasant, charming even, however table service can be embarrassingly gushy (another reviewer mentioned ass-kissing).  This is the kind of place where bringing a pile of onion rings or a lettuce wedge to the table takes three chattering sycophants. We endured a flowery speech and unsolicited updates on lava cake, until it finally arrived half an hour after entrees were cleared. Hardly worth a wait.   The whole meal took forever, which in an attractive, upscale room is often confused with fine dining. Paul Fleming is a respected restauranteur, and rightly so based on my visits to his other kitchens. But I am not that confused.

The food raves are largely warranted, but what further separates Lo-Lo's is the service and multiracial atmosphere, which can be hard to come by in Phoenix.  Before I'd walked halfway across the street from our car towards the restaurant, we were acknowledged by an outdoor hostess. A couple minutes later, she beckoned us from inside the front door to "Come on in"  - as if this were a special clubhouse or night spot.    Inside, our waitress was friendly and knowledgable and a tag team staff is always breezing by, anticipating needs: refills, napkins, defibrillators.  A couple tables over, they fussed over an elderly patron like bees on a honeycomb.     There's a pleasant and thoroughly Black self confidence about Lo-Lo's that's, I dont know...affirming.  They're good at what they do, and treat everybody the same- which is quite well - even if you're a patronizing N. Phx yuppie on your annual sociological trek down to the hood.  We were the only Anglos in our area, and felt welcome and thoroughly taken care of.   Righteous chicken, laughably huge waffles. Lunch here and you may not eat again til breakfast.  Not fancy, but fine.  Worth a special trip.

This is not a great restaurant, but I am fond of this place.   It can be loud and the chairs are cheap.  Tables are too close together and sometimes wobble. But I am fond of it.   Mi Patio doesnt lure hordes of foodie hipsters like El Bravo or Carolinas and the simple Sonoran fare is not remarkably better than Carlos O'Brien's - yet I bristle at Carlos and cop an irrational, almost paternal sentiment towards this place.        I am fond of Mi Patio because this is the home of nice, hardworking people - and whether they know it or not, their familiar routines and personal instincts comfort me.  The way the old man greets us too loudly before the front door shuts completely behind us.  The way the server seamlessly catches my eye and beckons us to follow him to a back table.   The way you needn't ask the price of recited "specials" because Mi Patio is devoid of deception. The way tortillas, wrapped in tin foil, invariably stay hot through your meal.  The way mistakes are courteously corrected without self conscious indignation or crocodile fawning amok in "better" restaurants. The way someone, somewhere, is laughing.  The way the old man looks in your eye when he asks how your meal was. The way he notices how tall your kid's grown, even though you only make it in two or three times a year.  The way I have enough cash to cover the bill. The way we take leftovers home and enjoy them that night.     Growing up in the Camelback corridor, my son has been weaned on corporate and chain restaurants, many of which are quite good. But none of them send him home with cheap bubblegum or a corny riddle, or dare toussle his hair. One day, when my son is my age, this restaurant and the old men - both of us - will be gone.  Perhaps the restaurant name will be lost to memory. But I hope he associates unpretentious decency and a quirky tenderness with Mi Patio - enough to look back and say, "I was fond of that place."

This is simple food. Simple, unhealthy ingredients, presented in utilitarian environs.  I had hominy stew and it tasted fine in a Progresso soup kind of way,  but I guess my real disconnect with The Fry Bread House  is I didnt encounter anything remotely interesting - unless you count morbidly obese people on either side of the counter. Maybe I didnt look hard enough.    I guess for me, the joy of visiting an ethnic place is sampling a bit of the culture gastronomically and through the restaurant's atmosphere - and there doesnt seem to be much joy here. I wont say there's no pride. There's just very little imagination or pizzazz. Maybe it's a traditional culture thing, but I find it kinda sad.   The menu is very redundant. Decor is charmless. Service is not  bad but perfunctory.  The stew was too thin to really slather on my fry bread, and I'm quite certain no one here is concerned about any of it. .   It presents an interesting contrast with a place like LoLo's. Inexpensive ethnic. Limited, unhealthy menu. Plenty of fat people. Sure, the food's better at Lolo's, but it's deeper than that.  There's an attitude, a pride, an eagerness to show off their skillz that's somehow uplifting and fun, whereas The Fry Bread House comes across, to me anyway, as nondescript and depressing.

It feels weird being the first to review this Scottsdale fixture.  I saw the Roche Sisters (dont ask) here twenty years ago and something called the Capitol Steps last week.  Both shows were crowded.  I mean, where ARE you people?  Maybe I'm the first person, under 80 and aware of YELP, to witness a show here. Could that be?  Capitol Steps was pretty geriatric political humor. Lots of bailout and Cialis jokes. Overheard in the foyer:    My teen:  Dad, I like politics but everyone here is, like, forty years older than me!   Me: Sixty. And dont stare.   But, hey, next week the SCFA calendar takes a decidedly edgier turn,  so listen up Yelpers. Performing Dec 4th is....Yo' Mama!  Yeah, that's right sucka. Yo M...What's that? Oh. Really? Um...we have a schedule change to announce.  It seems that performing Dec 4th at SCFA is... Yo Yo Ma.  Sorry.    The theatre?  There are two. We were in the big one, named after Virginia Piper. Seats around 800. Steep incline. Reasonably intimate. Good acoustics. Attractive wood accents. It's quite nice, really. Feels new.    The second theatre seats a hundred and thirty, and in a bizarre twist of local nomenclature is NOT named after Virginia Piper. It's called The Stage, and is capable of hosting Dexys Midnight Runners concerts and Pauly Shore Film Retrospectives.  Simultaneously.  Nice venue, inside and out. Really. Nearby free parking. Go. Have the veal.

I guess Malee's has been around 25 years, but it seems like fifty, and I mean that in a good way.  The restaurant is both venerable and hip enough to comfortably pass as Scottsdale "special occasion" - without breaking the bank.    Is it as uniformly "special" as the finest resort dining room. No. Nobody here is going to fold your napkin into a swan and there's no focal Dale Chihuly wine rack or glorious mountain view. But if you play it smart, a memorable and exotic meal can be had in a charming locale.    Here's my advice, lemongrasshopper:     Make a dinner reservation. Table location and service are better when you do.  True most places, but moreso here .    Get the pot of soup.  Tom Ka Gai is a warming, communal ritual and helps smooth over slow Fri & Sat nite service.    Solicit server recommendations. Most of the menu resonates and Malee's tailors spice level to individual tastes well, but some dishes are consistently better than others.    Do all that, and I'm pretty sure you'll have a nice experience. Walk in cold, take a blind stab at the menu, and you're apt to be less impressed.   I like the atmosphere, especially in the main dining room. It's an older building, with low ceilings and residential style rooms. Dimly lit, but not clubby and masculine like Don & Charlies. An unseen piano gently tinkles in the background.  Older couples, younger out of towners, packs of gay foodies, the occasional family celebrating a birthday.  A pleasant, bustling mix.    There are art galleries and holiday lights on Main Street (which is more of a  quiet side street at night) and plenty of parking at dinner time.  Fine choice for a date or before a show,when you're trying to impress someone special with your inscrutable melange of bold yet traditional values - rather than simply with your wallet.

Our wait was five minutes, arriving at 4pm on a Friday and opting to sit at the bar. I hadnt been here in probably 14 years.    Both pizzas were a little disappointing. Very good certainly, but not out of this world. I still remember chomping into my first Wiseguy in the early nineties; how qualitatively better it tasted than any previous pizza.  How explosive flavors mingled in my mouth and how my companion and I raved at how awesome it was after, literally, every bite.   None of that happened this time. Sure, the competition has dramatically stepped up but I say, respectfully, that the product has slipped a little. My outer crust was burnt, pretty badly actually. Some wood oven char is expected and I dont normally even eat the ring,  but do wonder if Chris would've served this had he been on site. Companion's pie touted basil as a topping, but came with a tiny decorative leaf or two in the center. Disappointing.   Their olive oil is heavenly. Addictive. I'd lick it off Russell Pearce if that was an option. The caprese salad, drenched in that stuff, is a first class oral shindig.   The Anglo fellow tending Bar Bianco and Hispanic gentleman manning our restaurant bar both exuded the gentle, professional charm that makes dining out a pleasure. The hostess team was competent, but that whole dance of loitering inside a busy little restaurant to identify and engage them has always felt awkward to me. I guess I'm just shy and would prefer they stand under a spinning, electric umbrella, blinking "H-O-S-T-E-S-S".  But seriously, getting there 3:30 or so, now that they're open continuously from lunch, will reduce the legendary waits. That's a good thing, because regardless of the gloried past or my recollection of it, this is still a distinctive and mostly charming destination.

Barrio has issues, but the fare is unusually satisfying. Masterful even. Sure, it's busy and loud, a little too expensive, they dont take rezzies and the parking's cramped, but this is the kind of inventive, non-formulaic food  that makes dining out memorable, even joyful, and the other stuff worth enduring.    Tacos look small and naked on the plate, unflanked by rice or beans, but are delicate, yielding and delicious - overstuffed with marvelous fresh ingredients; not the "fresh" touted by Taco Bell, but dreamy cheese, flaky halibut, exquisite slow roasted pork, fresh avocado wedge, secret sauce,etc.  Messy, surprisingly filling and an absolutely first class oral shindig, completely divorced from "tacos" elsewhere, and well worth the 12 or 15 dollars or whatever it is they charge. I like the fish tacos at Cheesecake Factory (which are bigger), but Barrio's are gastronomically in a different league.   Soups are flavorful and textured.  My companions rave about the mole and the duck.  The pork torta is amazing.  To call the warm churros with ice cream a "treat" is a criminal understatement.  If you're on a budget, take your date just for the churros. Later, you will have sex.  It may not trump dessert, but you will have sex.  ( If for some reason, you dont, leave that person at once. You will never please them. )   Not everything on the menu elicits quite that euphoria, but there are half a dozen items that flip my feral bioswitch from "eat" to "devour", like a wolf over fresh kill.   It's like a click in my head, and this Silvana Salcido Esparza Comida de los Dioses, or whoever she is, deftly holds the switch.    I'll forego comment on the bar because, surprisingly, I dont drink.

I visited a couple times about 25 years ago, when my future wife was infatuated with one of the bartenders. TeePee seemed reasonably satisfying back then and I cant decide if tastes have changed that much or the food has objectively fallen off a cliff.   It may be a little of both.   Table service was friendly but inattentive, if that makes sense.  Decor is Flintstones meets Happy Days on the Oregon Trail. Or something.  Which would be fun....if the food was edible.  Prices run a buck or two higher than many Mexican chains; again, reasonable only if the food was better. Or even as good, as BajaFresh, Taco Bell or Chipotle.   In this industry, there's a thin line between venerable charm and past- its-prime trap, and if you insist on lousy ingredients and dont bother to ask customers how they want their heuvos cooked, then even if your front hostess is a doll, you're on the wrong side of that line.

I dont like the damn fries. Let's get that out of the way upfront. And the techno beat at four in the afternoon isnt my thing. But I liked everything else about FEZ.   You know about the food. It's very good. Not too expensive. What's best, however, is the service. From the moment we walked in, our ungainly intergenerational party of holiday misfits was welcomed and treated great. God knows what staff said about us back in the kitchen, but they were nice as pie out on the catwalk.   Of course, we're fairly nice too. But still. The staff was confident and charming and made us feel "at home" - if your home had Dali-esque chandeliers and a massive overhead speaker wedged into the ceiling, throbbing like Johnny Wadd.

Wish I'd happened upon joyce k's review, prior to trekking in here last night, cuz the $14 ahi burger jump started an oddly disappointing evening.  Very thin composite patty, neither grilled not seared pink inside, but griddled grey all the way through, like a Boca burger. The bun was maybe one grade above a commercial McDonald's bun. Soft and unsubstantial. Since this $14 entree excluded sides, I paid an additional $3 for "root vegetables", apparently Chelseas' code for 'colorless scoop of undercooked fried potato cubes'.    We'd eaten here a year or so prior and had a more than respectable meal with a charming young waiter, so were genuinely surprised at how cobbled together and prideless this dish appeared. Yet even I admired how our strategically inattentive waitress 'forgot' to ever swing by and inquire how little I was enjoying this star crossed (or was it Starkist?) patty.  She gets it...this restaurant biz.   A grand total of four beers on tap, starting at $7 a pint? You do realize, Chelseaphiles, the object of your rather pricy affectation abuts the backside of a gas station along the guanoed canal and a bug infested apartment eyesore looms across the street?  Yeah, sure. It's "Arcadia". Whatever you say.      As a weird and perhaps inappropriate aside, it took my actively searching wife and I most of the evening to spot a single 'person of color' in this sprawling, adequately lit establishment.  It was packed with a forty minute wait, so we're talking hundreds and hundreds of people.  I finally saw an older woman off in a corner who the missus confirmed vaguely looked Philipino. Sure, it's just one snapshot on a Thursday night, and I have nothing against PV Caucasians descending from hilltop palazzos for a "comfortable", burger, cookie and confab.  White folk gotta eat.  Heck, we're hungry, white and reside on a gentle knoll ourselves. But all the same, in a major city in 2011, it's probably fair to at least wonder if such a notable absence of color was entirely coincidental or, like some of the food and service, a product of less tasteful intentions.

Bumped into John Shadegg here Friday night, but this is still a reputable restaurant. The southwest cuisine has some zip and is broadly well executed. Table service is efficient,  but can be cool.     Dinner entrees and specials lean pricey, so I usually go for a green chile burger with a side of Azteca soup.  Conventional, but both elements are sizable, delicious and a relative steal at $11. The burger is a half pound of chuck, well dressed with a spongy roll. The soup is a spicy chicken tortilla variation with some subtle hints.  It's a satisfying plate for about the cost of my wife's 4 oz glass of vino.   If they had interesting beer on draught, like a really nice IPA, and more charming servers, this might be five star territory.  p.s. - sunday brunch is not a buffet, but the menu's inventive, elegant and delicious. Recommended.

Whatever you call it - Piestewa, Squaw Peak, or Phx Mountains Park - this is a remarkably accessible Sonoran landscape lodged in the middle of the nation's fifth largest city. Still free, with mountain expanses most visitors never explore.  Indeed, the park experience can be starkly divided between The Summit Trail and Everything Else.  On weekends, ascending the crag is akin to strolling in a parade, albeit at a dusty, jagged 16% incline. It's hard to find weekend parking, but it's an excellent 60-90 minute overall (up and down) workout, with ample cougars for you Wild Life lovers.      I'm more enamored with Everything Else.   Not just the Circumference(302) and Nature (304) paths you pick up at the back of the parking lot. But all the marked and unmarked trails beyond.  The 1A horse trail, the 8 and 8A on the east side, the VoAZ, 202, 8B and irregular link connectors, and the granddaddy 100, which runs west from Tatum, under the 51, thru North Mountain on 7th St all the way to Seventh Ave in Sunnyslope.  It's mindboggling to think you can hike (or mountain bike) 20 miles or more in the city with this kind of uninterrupted scenery, not once crossing a street grade intersection.    I've seen a rattler, gila monster and three coyotes on the outer trails, but that's over decades and several hundred hours in the preserve. It's quite rare to spot anything but birds, rabbits or squirrels. But, as I say, the scenery, relative solitude and physical and spiritual benefits of exploring these myriad mountains and valleys is priceless.   Bring water, and for longer hikes, skin protection.

I thought the old Pei Wei was okay, but didnt fully appreciate its subtle virtues until we walked in today. Sheesh. They removed all the comfy booths in favor of regimented food court tables, reduced the overall seating area, downgraded the condiment and self serve drink stations, replaced chinaware with plastic shells reminiscent of Kids Cuisine tv dinners. The whole thing is depressing.   The food is worse than before - at least mine was - and as others have mentioned the portions have gone on a crash diet.  Healthy upgrade, s'ppose, since my tongue informs me they've piled even more sugar and salt into their sauces - if that's possible.  The limited menu is a little cheaper, I think, but doesnt approach the variety, appeal or value Pei Wei built its rather middle of the road reputation on.   My bill was also screwed up. At least twice. First, they quoted the wrong remaining balance on my debit card, so I had them void the transaction and bill to another card, at which point they charged me for a phantom drink.  The manager wasnt able to credit that, so voided the entire sale again and billed me a third time. I now have three receipts.   It'll get straightened out  and I have no problem whatever with the girl in front, or anyone who works there. But these systematic, abrupt downgrades scream customer indifference....you can almost hear the sneering boardroom banter all the way from Manhattan.

Dont let the terminally sad interior of this dive fool you - the kitchen's consistency and quality control is top notch.  Chen & Wok's dozen or so ricebowl lunch specials (served before 5PM daily) brimming with meat and vegetables - each priced under $5 - are truly one of this town's culinary bargains. Less of a bargain at dinner.   I'm partial to the chicken curry bowl - succulent stir fried chicken with huge chunks of al dente carrots, onion and green pepper topped with an addictive thin sauce packing medium heat (not that tasteless thick, floury gravy goop passing as "curry" in so many fast food places). They get their chicken (or at least they used to) from Firpo Poultry Farm, and I think it's a step up from meat used at some other rice bowl joints.  Delicious and remarkably consistent.    Soups are served very hot (temperature) and are therapeutic on a cold or rainy day.  Take out orders are always packed up securely with plenty of condiments and utensils.  My teenaged son and I eat here semi-regularly and have a good time, slurping our food and people watching, but you'll wanna stay clear of the "dining room" if you're on a date or trying to impress anyone. I think they're trying to finally spruce it up a little, but it's got a ways to go before I would dine in with a genuine guest (ie stranger).  EDIT: Nov 29 2010  They've painted the place, put in new tables and chairs and even hung a couple pictures. You can officially eat here with a woman now!!

At the center of this operation is a fabulous crust. I had envisoned sort of a gigantic, doughy calzone filled with equal parts air and filling, but it's much better than that. The crust is a thin shell, like a pie crust, which gives the sandwich a firm, easy to handle structure while maximizing the filling cavity.   The chicken tikka masala was aromatic, beautifully seasoned and downright glorious. Just a wonderful sandwich, even without the complementary and complimentary yoghurt. Shepards pie and a traditional "Oggie" received raves as well.   Service was friendly and professional. My only quibble is that certain aspects of the decor scream Tempe dive bar more than outstanding niche restaurant - even at lunchtime. It's rather dark and small, the ceiling's painted black with what looks like auto body paint, furniture is beaten up, the back door glass is cracked and there's tacky boxes of supplies blocking what is already a narrow floor aisle.   Do I think they should invest in brass and wood paneling and pretend to be Houstons? No. I just think their food concept and execution is so unique and terrific that deferred maintenance and sloppiness around the edges kinda detracts from their hard earned, fundamental excellence.   It doesnt detract a lot. CPC honors and indeed transcends "British Cuisine" and is definitely worth a visit. The food is marvelous.  Service is good. Everyone seems to be having a good time.  But if you're older or fussy, like me, just dont expect Buckingham Palace.

Reserving specific seats is nice and the kids serving were polite, but  the rest of the concept and execution doesnt work for me. It's too dark to see menus, trailers are too loud to easily communicate with wait staff (let alone your companion), and  settling tabs during films is inevitably distracting.    I'm told their Cinema Suites format is more spacious than our "Fork & Screen" option,  but when the 400 pound patron in front of me descended into his Playskool-strength theatre seat - and into my knees with the force of a medium speed car accident, that less than luxurious 'impression' evoked something more akin to "Fuck & Scream" -  I literally blurted "Fuck" and screamed at  the bone cracking pain  radiating from both patellas.   When I slid over behind fatso's 100+ pound wife, she's banging into me too, so it's not their fault. The seats are just cheap, with lousy springs and they're hard to settle into comfortably.  I was kicked from behind periodically.  All by adults btw.  It's interesting how many yelpers rip kids and seem to feel 'adults only' or food/bev service somehow conveys a first class experience.  To me it felt more like a bad coach flight; cabin lighting's busted and some douchebag's  reclining into your space.

A fine place to pick up addictive Sonoran staples, or, if you dine in,  hepatitis.  I thought this was supposed to be the "nice" location, a step up from the gangland locale, but it's jammed with junkies, disgustingly dirty, with all the ambience of an Okie squatter's camp from "The Grapes of Wrath".  The original on Mohave is cleaner, less crowded and even with bulletholes and security bars over the windows, really quite charming compared to this.

I like what Hana is not as much as what it is.  It's not a concept. There arent any consultants or flowery speeches or aquariums flown in from Hawaii. Just quality fish prepared and served by what looks to be a talented and gracious extended Japanese family.   And by quality I dont mean it's Bluefin of The Highest Order or The Stylings of Nobuo, necessarily, just that Hana's stock is better than most places you're likely to walk into around here.   This Sonoran cheapskate thinks prices are generally fair for what you get.  $16 Umi No Sachi is a lightly dressed spring mix topped with a dozen or so sizable slabs of sashimi. Yeah, a dozen.  Big noodle soup bowls with tempura sides are $9-10. An appetizer of eight or so small fried oysters, crunchy outside, moist and briny within, was only $6.95.   Tables are too close together and the whole strip mall vibe is kinda cramped, if that sort of thing bothers you. The downside of BYOB is that the drink selection isnt very interesting.   All coastal cities have Japanese joints like this, but I'm delighted these folks decided to set up shop in CenPho. If you need the cushy banquette and garish aquarium, go to Scottsdale. If you need to impress a jaded epicure, try Nobuo at Heritage Square.  If you just want a satisfying, authentic and accessible Japanese fish fix, pay a visit to Hana.

Just one lunch visit to this oddly angled and hard to find storefront, and I'm convinced Bertha's value and attention to detail exceeds that found at more heralded, pricier luncheonettes.   Fresh squeezed lemonade is just that. The best potato salad ($1.95) I've encountered;  precisely softened baby reds dusted in dill and not too much mayo. Hefty, succulent curry chicken wrap ($6.50), perfectly balanced and assembled, accompanied by a fresh chocolate nut cookie.  $4 turkey chili, which was either 16 or 20 oz, and comes with nice brioche toast.   It's absurd to think my mom and me conveniently lunched here for less than $20, and brought home food, whereas later that evening, after waiting half an hour for a table, my wife and I spent more than twice that at Chelsea's, for a decidedly inferior meal.

My father's kitchen knife was decent, forty years ago. But after he passed away, his widow had a dilemma. It had dulled to the point where it couldnt cut flank steak to prepare Beef Stroganoff, yet she couldnt bear to replace it.  It reminded her of him.   So, my 78 yr old mom asked me to see if I could get it sharpened somewhere. You'd laugh if you saw the knife. It isnt high end and the handle is worn and gray, like cracked driftwood.  Yelpers liked PKH service, so off I went with Dad's knife and one El Cheapo of my own.  Honestly, I was hesitant approaching the door. This place is run by a chef, and the website drips with Japanese specialty knives costing hundreds of dollars. I took a breath, "steeled" myself, unsure what to expect.   Well, this guy, Eytan I guess, couldnt have been nicer.  Nice isnt even the word.  He examined my crummy knives intently, handled them like they were Faberge eggs, kindly educated me on the makers and explained in detail what he could and couldnt do to hone these particular blades. Turns out, the Italian maker of Dad's knife was pretty good. "These always come back", Eytan said, and he was right.   For less than ten dollars, this bona fide expert took what could've been a mundane, or  preoccupied or even sneering transaction and instead made me feel like Chris Bianco or someone, and more importantly, made an old lady very happy.   This guy's my hero and deserves your business as well.

The food here is wildly hit or miss, but if you're flexible and pay attention, a terrific seafood meal can be constructed at an obscenely low price.  I had 20 big New Zealand mussels, a raw oyster, 8-10 sushi pieces, dim sum, soup, steamed broccoli, a couple cooked chicken dishes, something called snowfish, Italy shrimp, crunchy green beans and Sprite - for $9.    Previous reviewer's caveat about raw food at discount buffets is well heeded, but on my visit, the shellfish generally outshone  steamtable entrees.  Cold mussels (steamed) were delicious with just a spritz of lemon - at a fraction of the cost in most restaurants. The mammoth oyster had a wonderful, fresh ocean smell, just like it's supposed to, and Alaskan crablegs disappeared faster than you can say "Deadliest Catch" or "Discovery Channel."     The sushi was freshly made but low grade (ie no really nice tuna ) and uninteresting.   A fried chicken dish was just terrible ( tough, chewy) and green beans were cold (malfunctioning burner?)   So, scout around a bit, with an eye towards which pans are being replenished and which ones sit and sit.  There's probably good reason.   My son and I really enjoyed our early dinner "adventure", along with several football players carbo loading, but this place isnt for everyone. It's quite filthy  and I wouldn't hang around the parking lot after dark.  Ambiance is westside All You Can Eat, and that eerie vibe from when this was Imperial Garden is completely in tact - like it's run by Chinese mafia kickboxers from Torrance or something. But that's half the fun, right?

What is a store? Is it a building? Is it a brand or an idea? No. It's a place they store stuff. Stuff you take home once you give them money. Today, Fresh and Easy was neither a store nor worthy of its name. It was "Tired and Difficult".  Like me.    I went there for a few things. The $5.99 mixed grill pack, featured front and center in their weekly ads.  They were "out".  They had chicken, but I didnt want four lbs of squawk.  I wanted a mix of beef, chicken, and if they happened to have any left, maybe a sausage or two. Like in the ad.  The only employee around to ask was busy with other customers. Screw it.   I migrated to one of the few everyday deals I can count on at F&e; their $7.99 large bottle of extra virgin olive oil.  There's usually a case or two on the shelf. Twenty or forty bottles. There were none. Fuck. This isnt even in the ad, or a special sale, where they might've had some run on it. It's been $7.99 for at least two years.    Since my wife is traveling, I asked our son (before he headed out the door for school) if he had any special requests from f&e. He said, "Dad, get me one of those indian frozen dinners they have. Like chicken tikka."   "You got it!"   He's a good kid. I was thinking of getting him an assortment of two or three. Wait. There's none of those anymore either! They used to have an entire freezer door dedicated to indian food. They didnt just downsize it - maybe it's not a big seller - there's not one goddam indian frozen food entree in the whole goddam "store".  They're not sold out. I looked at the shelf labels and they dont stock it at all anymore.   Good things? Store's clean, milk is $1.98 a gallon, and there's a friendly lady up front who's been there from the beginning.  But there's a reason they throw their $5 coupons at you like confetti. They dont take manufacturer coupons and there arent that many compelling  deals. But all that's secondary.   You're a store.   Store stuff.  I'll even give you money.

Preceding reviews provide an excellent sense of the flavor and amenities at central Phoenix's Granada Park, however as a longtime neighborhood resident, I'd be remiss if I didnt warn potential visitors about this urban legend's rarely broached dark side.   In the palo verde thicket between the restrooms and garbage canisters lurks a toxic, pedophiliac balrog, ten feet tall.  Please think of the children before you venture near this, or any, area of the park.   The lower pond is stocked with diabolical candiru, so gentleman BEWARE!!  I have avoided the pond for many years and also urinate problem free. Coincidence?     Finally, the snakes. In the brambles. On the trails. Coiled overhead, hanging from the shade trees. I'm not a herpetologist, but have yet to see a bite victim receive the needed medical attention in time to survive.  It all happens so quickly.     We're working feverishly to eradicate these grave dangers, but please  reconsider plans to visit my neighborhood park until it is, you know,  safe. We'll let you know when.

Little Rangoon features novel cuisine, well executed dishes and quite reasonable prices (thx to the 30% discount) . Seven of us shared a unique family style dinner in a pleasant atmosphere, for under $100 before tip.   We liked all four curries, but agreed the fish and pork belly were best, while beef and chicken seemed more an accomodation to western tastes. I normally dismiss tilapia as a cheap bland whitefish, but it's a knockout with the curry.  Everyone liked the Tobu salad, and Tea Leaf salad got raves from my wife, who's not a particularly adventurous eater. Deep fried opa squash has a flaky texture, like swordfish, and was also quite good.   What stands between Little Rangoon and five stars?  An owner waited on us, which has its charms, but he was also kinda tone deaf in terms of certain aspects of table service.  Portions arent big, and passing the shared plates around there was more a feeling of rationing than of plenty.  Nobody starved, of course, but a better server could've handled that and some other little things better. Not a huge deal.   Overall, we had a very positive experience, and recommend this place if you're seeking something different, arent in a hurry and dont want to break the bank. Dont let the hidden location or lack of customers discourage you.  The food really is quite good, with a handful of intriguing dishes, and worth the trip.

I'm old. So when the family roars that that we simply must try the new, hip, central Phx hangout, replete with twenty and thirtysomethings and focal wine rack, the blood kinda drains from my face. OK, I sigh. Let's get this phony, elitist jive over with.  Long waits. Gum chewing, drink pushing service. Overpriced food that looks and sounds better than it tastes.   Well, mares eat oats and does eat oats, but little Maizies aint too "jivey".   It's one of those tiny places without a foyer, so I open the front door and am smack dab self conscious. Ask for a menu, before my party arrives, and slip outside to review. Very friendly girl obliges. Once assembled, she offered three seating options: patio ( a little too warm), the bar (lumbar too old) and community table, which I immediately grab, having mastered the concept of ignoring adjacent strangers in elevators, bathrooms and at Motor Vehicles.   We had three non-exotic but terrific dinners.  Wife sighed over  salmon and pasta. Teenaged chili expert gave a big thumbs up to that and his chicken sandwich.   And I was really, really impressed with my Italian sub panini. Quality bread. Dense meats and cheese, perfectly dressed, marvelous texture and variety of tastes in every bite. Sandwich on par with Houston's and better than anything I've had at Pane Bianco or Corbin's (see other reviews). The noodle kugel didnt wow me but was unusual and a fun thing to have on the menu.    Overall, we received Houston's lunch quality (or very close to it), for two thirds the price, and were very pleased.  Server was first rate; mature, friendly, not pushy at all and reasonably attentive. Made us feel right at home.   The space tries too hard to be eclectic and hip, imo, but that's what kids want today, so whatever. Flat screens show sports, but not a sports bar vibe at all since the sound was muted; I'm a fan and barely knew they were there.   I withheld the fifth star only because this place was the noisiest restaurant I can remember being trapped in. Not music. Just Friday night people noise, bouncing off the concrete floors into my ear canals. Had to basically yell at companions all night and couldnt hear half their responses. Again, that's what the kids want, I guess, so carry on. Other than that, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with Maizies in every way, and have my eye on a quieter, cooler patio table for next time. Maybe around the holidays. Perfect time to ignore more nearby strangers.

I feel a little funny granting five stars, since that kind of rave implies everyone will love Al Hana - and I dont think that's true.  It helps to leave one's Scottsdale or Camelback corridor preconceptions in the parking lot, in order to find treasure within the area blight, and indeed, within the gray, dreary walls of Baiz Market.   If you approach Al Hana with a traveler's sense of wonder, however, this establishment is very cool.  The market is fascinating, especially the tiny bakery and butcher area in the back. The restaurant is more of a simple counter, no frills and limited menu, but rates an objective five stars based on food quality, value and service.  Delicious, cheap, and the young lady who helped us was very nice.  I dont need a sorbet course to give it five stars.   Maybe it's different during lunch hour, but at 5:30pm we were the only Anglos in this fairly large neighborhood facility.  Many women in hijabs and abayas.  Young men of varied Middle Eastern persuasion. In most respects, it felt like a market half way around the world.  Iraq or Jordan maybe.  Not every Arizonan's cup of tea, perhaps, but for foodophiles and the culturally curious, definitely recommended.

Indian food!  New fangled technology!  Cute name!   Central Location, convenient to light rail!   There's plenty to like, theoretically, but our experience  here was one and done. We arrived early evening, before a ballgame.  It seemed a little off peak, like maybe the B team was on duty.   We ordered via the touch screen, and after a couple tries, generated a receipt.  Then waited a long while for "fast food", and it seemed longer because you dont get a human confirmation that it's even in progress.  Half the wait, I wondered if there was a problem - moreso because workers behind the counter looked as disoriented and idle as we were.  Eventually, they brought the food (or we retrieved it, i forget), but none of this inspired much confidence or good will.    My curry was on the bland side. Not terrible, but this place is altogether too tentative.

The food's good, but you know that. The atmosphere's notable too.   Part of it is the young, hip servers who are usually efficient and always friendly and fun to look at.   Part of it is the location, offset a few blocks from Central. You can enjoy the big buildings, but you're not quite in the middle of it, logistically or spiritually.  This feels like an out of the way throwback for a tryst or a rendevous.  .   Part of it is the property itself and retro design. The narrow front desk and  foyer opening up into the bar and colorful restaurant to the right, and a snug courtyard pool towards the back. It feels like a pocket Vegas lodge from the fifties before everything there went on steroids.   Perhaps the biggest part of the atmosphere, though, is the late Don Bolles. This is where the reporter was murdered, in 1976, and where Phoenix arguably began its evolution from a mob run backwater into a modern major American city.   Every time I park my Fusion in that little lot, I wonder.  Is this the spot?  It's an important political and historical event in Arizona. We cant be sure who ordered the hit, but it's clear Bolles was a victim of domestic terrorism.  When you enter the hotel, there's a bust of the intrepid reporter on your left.  Enjoy your meal.   *****  Food: 5 stars Dessert, Drinks: 3.5 Service: 3.5 Atmosphere: 5

I dig the space and its clever orientation away from the street. You're literally steps away from roaring, belching Camelback, but might as well be in an architect's home in the foothills or a secluded art space.   I didnt like the potato pizza much and feel the one at Sauce is better, although I was impressed with The Parlor's crust.  This pie couldve stayed under the fire another minute or two - there was no carmelization of ingredients. It came with gorgonzola, pancetta, Yukon gold potatoes and leeks. Sounds pretty bold, right? Well, they were very sparing with the pancetta and gorgonzola, and the potatoes were sliced almost transparently thin, like chips.   We agreed the pizza needed something more, visually and gastronomically. Garlic. Red peppers. Rosemary. More pancetta. Something.   The butternut squash risotto was three or four star - I've had better. This was a liitle too al dente, and the squash, while appropriately tender and nicely dusted with walnuts (I think), lacked that savory flavor wallop indigenous to butternut squash.       Other entrees were better. A generous chicken and pear salad was a hit and an Italian sub looked and tasted great.  Just looking around, I'm inclined to think food here's generally quite good and I basically ordered the wrong things.  I would certainly return and try something else.   Table service was decent, not great, with no real slip ups, but you can also sense a vibe among certain staff that they think the privilege is mostly yours.  Not much of a reception when we arrived ("Inside or out?") and no one in front thanked us upon departure.  While my wife was scanning the wine list, a server waited tableside, then silently walked away. Apparently my wife takes too long for this energetic outfit.    116 valued Yelp colleagues are exactly right. This is four star territory.  Way too imaginative for three stars, too flawed for five.

Quality isnt up to Bianco's obsessive standards, but the menu is engaging and reasonably well executed. Service ranges from sharp to self absorbed.  The space is attractive, interesting and comfortable.    Dont get the soup of the day, no matter how much they push it - it's always watery and disappointing.  The pork sandwich sucks. Once I had a hair in my pizza, but we've been here a lot and otherwise hairless.     Favorites include:  Puttanesca pizza - tender calimari.  really nice with fennel and capers.  Margherita and sausage pizzas are bueno.   Duck Club - unique, complex  Shellfish linguine -  the $12 app portion (mussels, shrimp, calamari and clams, in spicy tomato broth)  is a steal.      For dessert, zeppole dipped in mascarpone and cranberry jam was really nice with coffee.      Food execution - 3.5 out of 5 stars Menu Appeal - 5 stars Drinks/Happy Hour - 5 stars Service - 3.5 stars Ambience - 4 stars Value - 3.5 stars

I lingered by the 24th street aperture around sunset, with a couple strangers, and wasnt too impressed at first. I heard a little squeaking from inside the tunnel, it smells pretty bad, and the bats are quite small. One or two fly out of the tunnel, then scoot right back in. Their flight is unusually jerky, not like a bird, and individual bats are difficult to follow. Think fast, drunken hummingbirds on steroids, that never completely suspend.   Anyway, a few more people showed up, and about fifteen minutes after offical sunset, more and more bats poured out. It was getting darker and I still couldnt tell if they were coming out and retreating back in  - that's how fast and small they are. But I could tell there were alot of them. Alot of specks racing down through the 30 ft deep Army Corps of Engineers' diversion channel.   That's when I saw it. The money shot that makes this a five star event. I turned my head up, away from the dark channel, toward the recently set sun in the west. And there, silhouetted against the lighter clouds, were hundreds of bats, arcing south and west together into the Phoenix night.  They came in waves. A group of fifty or so, then a lull, then another fifty. This went on for fifteen minutes and I probably saw more than a thousand bats by the time I left. Walking back home, a swarm came near enough to make me flinch, but my breath or movement - or maybe just my mass -activated their sonar and scattered them instantly in a different direction.   To think this unusual nature show transpires every night, less than a mile from the hustle and bustle of 24th and Camelback is pretty neat, I think, and I'm really glad I saw it. It may not be the Grand Canyon, but it might make you think about nature in a similar way, about it's mystery and splendor. It's free, a tiny bit scary but safe, and should capture most people's imaginations. Highly recommended.

A warm greeting means alot, but if that's the best part of one's take out experience, the establishment probably doesnt warrant four or five stars.  Portions are solid and prices fair, but there are a number of things Karey's could improve on.   First, the signature dishes we tried didnt have much wow factor at all.   The cute little lumpia are like Sharon Stone in 'Basic Instinct'. Blonde and delicious on the outside, dark and horrible within. The pork paste, or whatever it is, might as well be dog food. Sorry, but that's my honest opinion.  The authentic, custardy cassava cake was different (yay!) and cheap(yay!), but quite mild for a dessert, at least to my undiscerning, sugar-addled taste.     Our chicken sample was dry, the pork adobo and beef offered were better - the texture of the slow cooked beef reminded me of my mother's Yankee pot roast - only this had less flavor and seasoning.  My unadventerous teen said his beef burrito was one of the worst meals he's had in a while...not much juicy meat taste and a ridiculous amount of cheese which overpowered everything.    Second, the free samples are fun and appreciated but the context in which they're provided is a little awkward.  When we walked in, all the steamtrays were covered and there were no pictures of the food - at least not that I remember. Maybe there's a culinary reason for the covers, but you cant SEE or really SMELL any food!  So you're kind of at Karen's "mercy" to provide you with these toothpick samples.  She cheerfully offered three mainstays (chicken, beef, pork)...and then there was this sort of lull, where I guess we were supposed to "decide", despite a blackboard off to the side, listing four or five addtl specialties.     It's partly my fault. I asked about pancit and dropped a hint or two that I wanted to try a variety, but couldve been more forceful probing options.  By this time, however, we had already eaten six skewers and I felt a little piggish asking for more. And Karen didnt offer more. Were we hard sold something we didnt want? No.  But I felt gently steered toward a few standard selections and away from other (more exotic?) options, especially considering there was nobody behind us in line.  If the covers were off, or there were pictures, I'd have been more likely to say, "That looks interesting" or "that smells good, what's that?".   In lieu of a detailed, descriptive menu (there is none, although Karen was verbally descriptive and very helpful) I just think a customer benefits most from a visual display (think Miracle Mile Deli, Panda Express, etc) of ready to eat fare.       We stopped by around 5:30pm on a Thursday, and were at Karey's around  fifteen minutes.  There were no other customers.  Zero.  Tons of traffic driving home from work. And nobody.   At this point, I think Karey's is a more sincere than genuinely  savvy operation, but that could change by smoothing a few rough edges,  showcasing all their recipes and maybe a spicier sauce or two.    Two minor glitches.  We werent given a receipt copy for our take out order. Also, one of our plastic clamshells leaked on the way home.   The sauce was filled near the brim, but it was messy and annoying.  Good intentions...not so good execution.      There's definitely potential here and they're not too far from making this a terrific place with broad appeal.  Who wouldnt root for a relatively unfamiliar cuisine served up by such friendly folks?   But I think (for well intentioned Yelpers) to pretend they've already nailed it, largely on the strength of warm greetings and surprisingly mild fare with exotic names, may be setting Karey's up for a wave of unmet expectations. I know that's how we felt.

Fine dining is an inspirational art, not a tablecloth or pricepoint, and at the heart of that art is originality, virtuosity and charm. All three are very much on display in this talented, imaginative partnership.     No place is perfect.  We waited too long for the check. My chair was awkwardly angled next to a drain on the patio. But the culinary sense of discovery and service highs are frequent enough - and sufficiently high - to rather comfortably ensconce FnB in five star territory.   I suggest booking an earlier reservation, before the restaurant is really bustling, and heeding the detailed (and dead on) recommendations of Mr Milic.

Quality over quantity.  Nobuo might endear itself more to western clientele if they offered something actually filling, like a big, inappropriate bowl of mashed potatoes (or starchy Japanese equivalent), to tide diners over between delectable flights of ephemeral fancy.    The highlights really are wonderful. Try the sublime grapefruit/hamachi, steamed buns, soft shell crab sandwich and deep fried shrimp w/ papaya slaw. Courses are slowly paced, fostering conversation and savory anticipation. Servers instruct diners to scarf morsels like "shots", and this really does feel more like a leisurely evening of wine tasting than a traditional sit down dinner.   Dinner for five, sans drinks, was $200, and this skinny multiculturalist immediately rushed home to fix myself a sandwich. And some dessert.  I can only imagine the consternation of fat xenophobes at Nobuo.  If you're comfortable surrendering cash along with the gauche expectation of feeling full after a meal,  dinner here can be a lovely treat.  Otherwise, I might suggest sampling portions at lunch first to assess the situation.

I'm a sports and hiking guy and my mom's into primitive cultures and shopping. Sometimes it's hard finding activities to share, but we both have a hoot here.   It's set up the same each February, in an enormous pavillion, but is well organized and staffed.  We usually go on half price Sunday, after crowds thin a bit. There's still hordes of people and hundreds of thousands of books. You cant possibly sift through it all.   We both find bargains right up our alley and the books are so cheap you can pull the trigger on intriguing titles you might not purchase at a book store.  Even with the parking fee, it's an unparalleled value, for a good cause and brings people together.   Every year when I walk out of this place, with a bagful of books in one arm and my elderly mom on the other, it feels like a morning well spent.

We're pretentious. Not pretentious enough to actually shop in Whole Foods, but pretentious enough to laugh at those who do. From a distance. We used to stand outside on the sidewalk and point, but now there's a bar inside from which you can mock rubbernecking husbands strolling by with lattes, forlornly mouthing "Honey, is that a barrr? I didnt know they had a barrr in here."   The food eventually arrives from steamtables about a quarter mile away at the other end of the palace and when you try to close out your beer tab the POS slip charges you for, like, Progresso soup and a bunch of organic bananas. The whole thing is so stupid it's actually kind of fun.   Like I said, I'd never shop in Whole Foods, but the bar experience was offbeat in a mostly good way.  OK, OK, we picked up a couple items on the way out.

My teenager doesnt exactly look like a thug, but he's a big kid with beard stubble in a hooded sweatshirt and basketball shorts.  Not your typical H&D customer. He was in there just before Christmas, when it was human gridlock, and couldnt find a particular item on display - it cost around $7.    So, he asked a clerk, who cheerfully volunteered to scour the back room, and who located a case of crystalized ginger, to complete the sale.  People will say that's what a clerk "should" do, but we all know it often doesnt happen that seamlessly - especially not under those circumstances.  Very pleased.
