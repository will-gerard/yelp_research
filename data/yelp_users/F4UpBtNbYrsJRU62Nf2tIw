I needed to replace a key for my apartment, so I handed the guy my key and said "I need one just like this" to which he responded "I have one that shape but without the holes" so I told him that was fine and he made the key. I give my card to his daughter and then he hands me the key that has a big stamp on it with the name of the shop and its phone number. As I'm asking if there are any keys that don't have the name because it has to look like I got them at the same place she runs my card. Which wouldn't be a problem except they didn't have any I could use! And she was rude to while I was trying to explain that I couldn't use it with Hicks engraved one it... She said well all we can do it cover it with tape. Really? Tape is the solution? How about giving me my money back because I can't use the key and I specifically said they had to look the same? Ugh

I can't say enough good things about this place. The first time I came here was almost two years ago, and I've been trying to figure out where it was. We found it again tonight ant I couldn't be more happy. It looks like a biker bar that might make some people feel uncomfortable but don't judge it by its cover. The people are fun friendly and incredibly nice. I love this bar and there's karaoke on the weekend!

I live this place! The pizza and wings deal is amazing. My mother's restaurant is the perfect name for this place. The people who work there are so nice. Me and my boyfriend called to ordered a pizza and wings to go, unfortunately on the way there we had a minor medical emergency. Long story short we ended up getting there about an hour and a half after we were supposed to. They were so understanding and even offered to make are food fresh.

I live this place! I would go here everyday if I could afford it. The coffee is good and the costumer service is fast and very nice.

There was a little confusion when it came to what I wanted. I said pink and white meaning pink and white powder, when I realized the woman was going to put the light pink over white tips I asked for both powders. It seemed like she was a little upset, she told some one else what I wanted and he ended up doing my nails. I was worried because of the other reviews and the misunderstanding but my nails turned out GREAT. they are the best nails I've gotten in Phoenix. I suggest you try this place but be clear on what you want.
