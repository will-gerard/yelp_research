I LOVE Salon Estique! I've been going to Salon Estique for almost 15 years now - yes, that includes through college and graduate school, when I lived in other states. I purposefully flew back to go to Salon Estique, that's how great it is! (Don't worry, I also flew back to see family too!)  I've had nearly every service done at Salon Estique, but my favorites are the facials and waxing by Liz or Faye, as well as the haircuts and color.  For facials and waxing, you cannot do better than either Liz or Faye. Both are excellent, dedicated professionals who will NOT up-sell you on unnecessary products (ladies, you know what I'm talking about). There are several types of facial options available: one for teens, an Express Facial (~45 min.), and a full facial, which is ~90 minutes long.  I've done both, although the full facial is a better deal because not only do you get the facial, but you also get an eyebrow wax for the same price. Taking care of 2 things at once? Yes, please!  Liz and Faye do other types of waxing, which I won't go into detail about here, but let's just say... all the waxing they do is NOT painful, they do NOT re-use sticks (so, no infections or gross things, hooray!), and they're very aware of your pain tolerance and preferences.   As for haircut and color... I admit, I have had my hair cut and colored at other salons. The haircuts were okay, but no one can color like the Salon Estique ladies. Peggy, Laurie, and Eva are my favorites! They thoroughly listen to what you want, bring over color swatches to make sure you both are on the same page, and they provide ideas if you are unsure.   The ladies (and gents!) work with your face shape for haircuts, as well as the amount of time you'd like to spend on your hair. I've never been up-sold any products, and everyone I've worked with for hair coloring has always made sure I LOVE my color before I leave. They will re-do it for you if you don't like it! Just say something!  I love how everyone remembers your name here, and everyone on staff checks in with you to make sure everything is okay (ex. when you're waiting for your color to dry - staff checks in, brings you a magazine if you need it, and will bring you refreshments if you request it). Eva and Laurie always give me advice on hairstyles when I'm at a loss, and of course, they're fun and make a long day (I've got long hair--takes a while to color!) go much faster.  Message me if you have any questions-- as a 15 year customer (and I'm still in my 20s, so that says something!), there's much more about the salon and services that I don't mention here, but that I've had done, and I'd be happy to answer any other questions.

First of all, THE LOCATION HAS CHANGED. I followed Yelp's directions because I'm a tool and didn't look up the actual address online... yup, they're no longer at 333 E. Osborn. They're at 1313 E. Osborn. So... yeah.  That aside, o-m-g. For a doctor of this sort, Dr. Cyr is AMAZING. I have been to many women gynos (sorry, no dudes up in my lady-business) and I've had good ones and I've had atrocious ones.  My atrocious experiences have all been in Phoenix, so I had been without an ob-gyn for several months until a co-worker recommended Dr. Cyr. Lucky for me, I struck GOLD! Dr. Cyr, you're not allowed to retire. Sorry. (Don't worry, she's young; she won't retire anytime soon).  Cut to the chase. Reasons why Dr. Cyr is amazing:  1) She doesn't make me feel like a creepy weirdo for not being married nor wanting kids anytime soon. SERIOUSLY, I got grief from ob-gyns for 'not being ready for a family yet.' Um, guys, I can't even feed myself on a regular basis, and you want me to have a kid? Major fail. Dr. Cyr DOES NOT DO THIS. She didn't even bring up me wanting kids now or in the future. Thanks, Dr. Cyr!  2) I didn't wait a million hours to see her! At my last gyno doctor (who shall remain nameless), I waited 2 hours for my appt. Wtf?? Here, I waited no more than 20 minutes, and that was because I was filling out paperwork. YAY!  3) Dr. Cyr answered my questions professionally and fully. She didn't shirk around my more... awkward... questions, and she explained the options to me in plain English. She reassured me on some things that I was worried about, and she even made me laugh in the process. I NEVER laugh at the doctors! This is amazing!!  On a less quantifiable basis, I felt Dr. Cyr just 'got' me. It's hard to explain, but I felt comfortable talking to her and felt I could bring any issue up and she wouldn't judge me for it.   Shoot, I think I want to have a baby with Dr. Cyr now. Wait.. that's not quite what I meant... anyway, go see Dr. Cyr if you have lady-parts! You won't regret it!

Born and raised in Phoenix, I've been going to Cheese n' Stuff since I was 10 years old... I'm normally a vegetarian, but I make exceptions for this place, it's that good!!  Super atmosphere, incredibly great service, and delicious food. The owners are absolutely wonderful, and it's been family owned and operated since opening. The girls who help run it are so nice and friendly, and it's wonderful to see a truly family owned local shop in Central Phoenix.  I absolutely love the turkey and cheese sandwich with a little mayo and tomato. Plain, but sooo good! Price is very reasonable, especially for the superb location.   I've seen this place really crowded around lunch time during the week, but they are very efficient in getting your lunch to you quickly.   Cheese n' Stuff also sells a variety of Scandinavian products, likes cookies and lutefisk (whatever that is) plus lots of other foreign foods I've never heard of. If you're looking for an obscure Scandinavian food, you might want to check out this place first.  In short, I love this place. Yummy food at great prices, an excellent location on Central & Camelback (near Dutch Bros!), and family owned. Yay!

Just finished up paying nearly $250 for the 'service' here, which is probably clouding my judgment a bit, but I know I won't be back here.  Side note: why is it practically impossible to find a good dermatologist in Phoenix?? This has got to be Top 10 Skin Cancer City in the world, you'd think we'd have some good dermatologists, but I digress.  I never even saw a doctor here, something I find strange. I was a new patient having an all-over skin check, since I had some moles removed in the past (from other dermatologists) that were problematic.   I only saw the PA and, while he was all right, it was just weird having a male doctor, and he and I both weren't keen on the experience. I purposely scheduled my appointment with the female doctor, only to be told once I arrived that the male PA would be checking me. :-/  I got a suspicious looking mole excised, which ended up being foolish of me. It's taking forever to heal, was extremely expensive, and ended up not being a big deal. I guess that's why you have moles removed, to test them, I just think the price should have been discussed up front. $250?? For a mole removal? Note to self: never having moles removed again, no matter how suspicious they look! (jk but really)

I like Sky Harbor a lot. This could be because it's my "home" airport, in that I'm from Phoenix and I fly back pretty regularly (every 2 months or so).  I'm comparing it to 2 other airports I also fly/flew out of frequently: Denver, and Spokane. Denver: nightmare. Spokane: heaven.  Phoenix/Sky Harbor falls in between those two. SH is definitely not as hard to navigate as Denver. If you get lost in SH, you're pretty pathetic. No offense, but there are signs everywhere and you don't have to take a train. Also, there are moving walkways everywhere too. And, when I've been there, those skycap guys who drive you around (if you ask) are always around too. So you could ask for directions, if you were that lost.  On the other hand, terminal 4 can be a nightmare... when it comes to parking/being dropped off. I've done both, many times, and hot damn. I'm really surprised more people don't get into accidents at SH when they drop off people. Also, the security guys outside yell at you if you dare stay there longer for any more than 5 seconds. I mean, really. I was carrying a heavy bag walking to my boyfriend's car when a security guy yelled at him to "keep moving." Ummm... I'm right here dude!! Sorry I can't run any faster to catch his car!  I fly Southwest mostly, though I've flown Alaska (terminal 2). Terminal 2 is obviously a lot less bothersome than 4, because it's less used. However, I don't remember how good the food options are in Terminal 2 so... expect fast food.  Terminal 4 has pretty great food options. They've got my requirements: Einstein's and Starbucks. They also have some Mexican food restaurant options, and a Cinnabon! They really have a lot of options, so you won't starve.  Free wi-fi. YES!  Bags arrive quickly. YES! When Denver totally ruins your bag (thanks, DIA!) and it finally gets delivered in Phoenix, the Southwest front desk people are really nice and accommodating, no matter how pissed you are. I'm speaking from personal experience, in case you couldn't tell! :)  All in all, I'm always pleased with my trips to Phoenix. It's not as fabulous as Spokane but... it's also not Spokane, thank god!

I've been here twice, and I've yet to be disappointed.  I've been to my fair share of Kinko's (now called FedEx Office, I guess?) and usually the service is... average. Not bad, per se, but just kind of lacking.  NOT the case here! Each time I've been here, I've received absolutely stellar service. Seriously, if all companies could bottle the work ethic found at this FedEx, we would NEVER have customer service problems ever again.  The first time I came, I came in just before they closed with an emergency copy job for an important interview the next day. They saved my butt! Not only did they do it for me, they did it with a smile and chatted with me the whole time. Very friendly and professional.  Today I went in, planning on just making a couple (non-emergency) copies by myself... right when I walked in, a friendly face greeted me and, while I told her I didn't mind making the copies myself, she told me she'd be happy to do it, and in a fraction of the time it would have taken me.  I wasn't able to send my mail, unfortunately (note: FedEx does not ship to PO Boxes) BUT the service was wonderful and the lady who worked with me was very pleasant.  I really could not ask for quicker or more pleasant service... for all you ASU West people, definitely take advantage of this FedEx/Kinko's! They're probably a lot faster and, price-wise, comparable to the library ;)

I'm disappointed by the low rating this Macayo's has! It's the closest one to where we live, and we've had nothing but great service and delicious, quickly served food.  The last time we went (around 2 pm on a Friday-- admittedly not rush time, but still), we were seated promptly, greeted, asked about our drink order, and served. Our server was attentive and answered all our questions without any snark or exasperation.  Our food came out hot and was delicious-- I forgot exactly what my boyfriend had, but it was something with garlic cream sauce, which was out of this world. I had the California Burrito (or at least that's what I call it... it's the veggie burrito) and it was so good I couldn't wait to take it home for leftovers! (I was the tool who left it there though... booo!)  The meal was reasonably priced, our check came out correctly, and we were given excellent service. No complaints, and we'll be going again!

Very disappointing service on a recent US Airways flight (or rather, non-flight since my flight was canceled and then delayed/overbooked).  Long story short: I missed my best friend's wedding in Washington because US Airways canceled my morning flight, then couldn't guarantee me and my guest a spot on the next flight.  Being canceled and then delayed would have been egregious enough, but it's the incompetence of US Airways staff that did it for me. I was never offered to option to fly Alaska Airlines, their partner agency, and I only found out about that option from other re-booked passengers (that option was, of course, sold out when I went to inquire about it).  When attempting to fly on the 8 p.m. flight, I was told my guest and I could not sit together, but if we wanted to pay $31 each for 'premium' seats, we could. How convenient.  I would think waiting for 10 hours in the airport would qualify us for seats together or, god forbid, access to the US Airways lounge, but apparently my guest and I didn't deserve those options either.  I've lodged complaints with US Airways and with the DOT, and I encourage those who have similar bad experiences do so as well.

Omggg Pullano's, where do I even start? First of all, this place is crazy close to us, which is a huge bonus :) Ever since "Daddy-O's" (gag me) took over Casey Jones (such a sad day), we've been looking for a new cheap bar that has a good atmosphere.  Enter: Pullano's! My boyfriend's brother told us about it and we finally went a couple of weeks ago... score!! We've been back twice since and, if we didn't keep ordering practically the entire menu and EATING IT ALL, we would go back more often...  The pizza? Awesome! Customize, order straight off the menu, whatever. Certain days they offer crazy specials on pizza (one special offers you a large pizza for free, if I recall correctly), so that's always worth looking into.  Great prices on pitchers of beer-- end of story. Get crunk (or watch your friends get crunk-- DDs are our friends!) on pitchers of beer from $9 (domestic) to $13.25 (seemingly everything else).  The servers are all young and very friendly, which is totally sweet. We've never had a mean or grumpy server-- huge plus. You may even get lucky and have one of the owners serve you, which is so cute, in my opinion.  Thursdays are the days to get wings (although I don't know if this changes...?? Call or check online). When we went (on a Thursday), wings were $.40 and, according to my boyfriend, really good.  I'm personally a fan of the pizza (duh) and the happy hour prices for appetizers-- um, $4 for a GIANT plate of bruschetta? Yeah, sign me up!  The only "downsides", if you can call it that, is that the place is ALWAYS busy. We've gone on a Thursday night, a Saturday around 3 p.m, and a Friday around 8... not "dead" times but not exactly hopping... but Pullano's was BUSY. Be prepared to wait 5 min. more and have to maneuver around large parties (that inexplicably like to push their chairs into the aisle...)  The other thing is the menu--- holy crap. Be prepared to sit there for a solid 10 min. trying to understand it all if its your first time there. The menu is HUGE and the print is really tiny. I mean, I'm practically blind, so take that with a grain of salt, but still. It's tiny print. Just be warned.  That said-- don't go. This is my bar, y'all ;)

I can't even begin to describe how incredible Flowers by Jodi is - if you're looking for wedding flowers, just stop now and go with Jodi, trust me.  I interviewed 3 different florists for my wedding, and all of them were more expensive, less responsive, and offered fewer floral options than Jodi did. Many of them had a "minimum order" requirement, which sucked because my wedding was extremely small - I didn't need to order extra flowers I couldn't use!  Jodi didn't have any of these stipulations - there was no minimum order I had to meet, no trying to talk me out of my ideas for flowers.  Jodi has several giant photo albums so, if you're like me and only have a general idea of what you want, she will go through the albums with you to make sure you know exactly what you're getting and she knows exactly what you have in mind.   She also has color schemes and lists of flowers (with pictures) for you to pick from. I can't emphasize how helpful this was - having photos to see how the flowers looked in other people's weddings was AWESOME. We both were on the same page, which is really important when you're planning a wedding!  Her prices were also the BEST out of all the florists I interviewed - my husband and I paid for the wedding ourselves, and our budget was tight. When I told Jodi our budget, she didn't even blink an eye (and trust me - some florists were pretty rude when I told them our budget :()  Jodi worked with us to get us the best flowers that were in line with our budget. Best of all? We got more flowers with Jodi than we were quoted at any other florist. Best BEST of all? The flowers were drop dead gorgeous. My bouquet was huge, the reception flowers were stunning, and we received so many compliments the day of our wedding.  I can't emphasize what a pleasure it was to work with Jodi. She always answered my calls (even when I completely changed the color scheme on her 2 weeks before the wedding... thank you Jodi!), she worked within my budget, her staff was so nice, and the flowers were beyond what I expected. Jodi really made our wedding special. Go with Jodi! :)

Yes, I'm giving this Harkins in the midst of ghetto-Phoenix 5 stars. GTFO! Why?!  Well, to quote Anthony P. below, "If you can remember waaay back when to the old Christown theater, where you had to bring a gun and knife to safely enter and exit, you will be happy to know that things have changed greatly. Both the theater and parking lot are safe, clean, and well lit."  His comment, x100!  I definitely remember scaaaaryyyy wayyy ghetto old-Christown theater, the one I used to go to in middle school with all my little hoodrat friends (I mean that in the nicest way possible, hoodrat friends!). It was crazy ghetto, hobos all around, and I'm pretty sure I do remember hearing rumors of people getting knifed. I went with my Dad once when I was 12, and I remember even he was slightly worried (and he's former military). So yeah... gross.  Fast forward 8 years and I come back from a) being spoiled by the AMC on Camelback I went to in HS (bc I was soooo much classier in high school, ha!) and b) being away at college, and my boyfriend suggested we go to 'The Harkins at Christown."  What the what?? Was my boyfriend trying to have me killed? At least wait til you've got a life insurance policy on me!  That being said, we went (I was dragged), and my -mind- -was- -blown-! Brand new (ohhh shiny!), brightly lit, huge parking lot, friendly ticket and concessions stand kids, and stadium seating!! And CLEAN!! And no knife fights out front!!!  I can't even believe this is literally right around the corner from ghetto-Walmart.  The outdoor kiosk things do work now-- you can buy your ticket from them if no one is at the counter.  I am definitely going to this theater more often-- You can't beat the Harkins deal (shirt deal, loyalty cup deal), the prices are better than AMC, and it's just as decent a theater as AMC at Camelback too. Yay Harkins!

Soooo... I really -don't- want to review this place, because I would hate for you all to find it and crowd it up, but since I'm a good Yelper, I'll share this gem with you!  This is our favorite Mexican food place to go to, hands down. The boy and I have probably, combined, been here six times already within the past six months. A couple of things that make it so popular for us that we go, on average, once a month? Their mailer coupons, which offer a "buy one get one free" lunch AND dinner special, and their (now) $2.99 margaritas. Last time we came, their margaritas (all the time, not just happy hour) were $1.99, but apparently too many of you already are catching on, so they've raised the price a bit.  But for two people who are broke as jokes (literally... boo!), we get stuffed AND drunk, or what I like to call "fat and sassy."  We've never ordered anything from here that wasn't good... that is a comment from the boy, because while he ALWAYS tries something different, I always get the same thing. Why mess with perfection??  My favorite meal: the veggie burrito, which comes stuffed with spinach and other random veggie goodness, and guacamole IN the burrito-- awww yeah buddy! Side of Mexican rice and black beans (or you can be healthy and get a side of salad.) Get in my mouth!  The boy's favorite meal now is probably the chicken fajitas he had last night, but he's also had their enchiladas, a few of their fish dishes, and some of their "combined plates", which are HUGE plates of food.  Prices for full meals range from $7-$13, and the $13 plates that I've seen are huge! Most, if not all, dishes come with sides, like rice and beans or salad, and guacamole, so you're really getting your money's worth.  Like someone else noted, you can get drunk here for cheap, albeit not as cheap as before. The drinks are $2.99, big and incredibly strong. Mi Pueblo knows what's up!  We walked out of there last night (using our BOGO coupon) for $25, including tip and 4 margaritas. Not too shabby!  Also, word to the wise: it's seat yourself mostly, so save yourself the awkward moment of coming in and standing there, looking like a shlub. Grab a seat, they know you're there ;)

I used to absolutely love going to this Last Chance, oh say about 6-7 years ago when I was in high school. It had great quality stuff, was reasonably stocked, and, while ALWAYS crowded, the people shopping and working were pleasant and helpful. No pushing, no rude behavior, none of that. I used to get great dresses and shoes from here...  No more. I went to this Last Chance about a month ago to go shopping with my boyfriend, who needed nice dress shirts for work. I walked out with a lost faith in humanity, and a strong desire to gouge my eyes out. I'm not kidding. I will NOT shop here again unless bribed with a considerable amount of Yogurtology (across the street!)  Okay so my problem with LS now is... well, everything. We went around 11 AM on a Thursday, which is a reasonable time, I would think... no. It is incredibly crowded, stuffed full of rude customers.  Several times, while I was physically looking through a rack of shirts, women would push INTO me to push me out of the way and grab something they saw. This happened so many times, I gave up on looking (probably their goal.)  No one was there to help us in the dressing rooms, so the BF just walked in... don't know if this is policy??  Most sizes were way too big (he's an average/popular size), so we left with exactly two dress shirts.  Seven years ago, it was fun to go shopping at LS and you walked out with some incredible finds. I don't think you can find anything like that nowadays-- it's been overrun with people probably trying to re-sell online (I mean seriously-- this one older woman had SEVEN pairs of the same color/size/style jeans?? Really??)  Two stars because I didn't check the women's shoe department which, hope against hope, is still decent. And for the fact that the BF was able to find 2 decent shirts.

Started taking our 6 mo. old puppy to this dog park recently (for those of you who go... yes, she's the one who runs around making "squeaking noises"... it's her version of a bark :-/).  Rose Mofford is great! Not hard to find (it's on the south side of the softball fields) and has it's own, almost separate parking area.  The big dog park, which is what we use, is HUGE. Tons and tons of space for your crazy dog to run around. 'Rest areas'/water stations are set up on opposite ends of the park, which is really nice because if you forget to bring your own water dish, there's one there for your dog.  There's always an assortment of balls on the ground, so unless your dog is picky about the toy she plays with, just use those. In fact, I'd highly recommend AGAINST bringing your own ball... we did the first time, and it became lost in the abyss.   We've only had 2-3 problems with big dogs whose owners don't know how to manage their dogs. Each time, the owners finally did wise up and removed their dogs from the park, and only one of them blamed us for their dog being a bully, so that was nice.  However, we've been strongly cautioned against taking our dog to the park during 'after work hours' or on the weekends because apparently that's when people who REALLY don't know how to manage their dogs are out, so be forewarned. We haven't gone during those times yet, but just a heads up!  The only minus star is for the fact that occasionally the field is flooded, which turns the whole thing into a muddy pit of doom. The dogs love it, but the back of my car (with towels) and my shoes (the oldest, grossest pair I have) don't love it.

To summarize: I love Biltmore Commons Dental Care and, as a Phoenix native, have not found a better dentist or dental team than Dr. Sadowski and co.  I've been going to Dr. Sadowski for a year now, since moving back after college, and have had nothing but excellent service in all aspects.  The front office team is great-- they make sure to mail out reminders a month before your scheduled appointment, they call you the day before your appointment, and they are friendly and helpful when checking in/paying your co-pay.  By the way-- I've visited Dr. Sadowski when I didn't have dental insurance and was treated courteously by the staff. Never once was I "up-sold", I was put on an easy and simple payment plan, and I was treated fairly, just like every other customer (with insurance or not).   One of the front office ladies is a little brisk; however, she's from the east coast-- give her a break, people! She talks a little fast and she's efficient-- if you're messing around or don't have your stuff together, sure, maybe it looks like she's being "rude". It's clear that she's just very efficient and most west coasters aren't used to that. Be patient, y'all. Their office is busy!  As for hours-- don't know what other Yelpers were talking about-- their office closes at 4 P.M. most days. I don't know if they're open Fridays, but they DO NOT CLOSE UNTIL 4 P.M. Honestly, it's never been a problem for me-- I leave work a few minutes before my 3 p.m. appointment, never have had to wait, and I'm out the door before 4 p.m. (score!)  I have to be upfront: I don't have any teeth problems, so I don't actually know how Dr. Sadowski is with root canals, fillings, etc. All I know is that my teeth feel great, no one up-sells me anything, and I get a very thorough cleaning and look-over by the dentist. Dr. Sadowski always talks over any issues I've had and makes sure to look over areas that I think are "bad."  PS. Megan the dental hygienist is AMAZING-- I seconded Yelper Caitlin F.-- she is wonderful and I want to be her friend too!!! Try to have Megan clean your teeth- you'll love her!

Went here yesterday for two reasons-- to look at the dogs (we're going to get one soon!) and to check out the thrift store.  The thrift store is very, very reasonable and stocked pretty darn well. I found a really cute summer dress for $5, a price very worth it for something I need AND that goes to supporting the Humane Society!  Lots of cool stuff for pets-- kitty condos and scratchers, plus dry dog and cat food (along w/ some wet, too)... dog teeth cleaning stuff, plus collars for cats and dogs.  They have a large children's sections (clothes, shoes, some toys), lots of cookbooks, and a pretty solid sized housewares section. Everything seemed well-priced and the ladies working the front desk were very pleasant.  We then visited the dog, then the cat section, and I LOVED it! I've been to other shelters that put the more aggressive dogs out with the quiet dogs, and the result is loud pandemonium. The AZ Humane Society at this location separates the loud dogs from the quiet dogs (or so it seems... it could have been nap time ;) so the BF and I were able to spend a lot of time with each dog, really getting to watch them and read their biographies. The set up was very conducive to adopting a dog :)  The cats section was just as nice-- the kitties have a lot of room to roam, so it seems, and most looked well fed, clean, and happy (save for the poor little kitties whose tails were cut off, or had been found as strays).  Definitely a worthy place to support, and well worth a trip to check out the thrift store as well. I'm happy to support the AZ Humane Society!

After reading reviews on Yelp about various French pastry shops, my cousin and I decided to check out Scratch due to its affordable prices and relative proximity to my apartment.  She and I recently returned from a summer trip to Paris, and we've both been absolutely dying for French crepes since being back. Since the reviews on Yelp were so good, we decided Scratch would be the first place to go... and I have to say, this is probably THE place to go for French crepes!!  We went to Scratch during lunchtime on a weekday, and arrived at the perfect time (approx. 1:30 PM). Had we arrived any later, we may have not gotten a seat! The place was super easy to find, even with all the construction going on on Indian School, and is absolutely precious inside. There are enough tables to seat about 20 people (my estimate), plus a large wooden table in the middle of the restaurant that can accommodate large parties or those waiting for their to-go orders. The place mats are cute pink plastic doilies, and add to the really cute flair the restaurant has going for it.  Once we sat down, we got down to the business of ordering our French crepes with Nutella. While we waited for our order to come out, we observed ALL the other people who came into the restaurant. For being a French restaurant, during the middle of a HOT HOT Phoenix day, on a weekday, this place was really busy! I'm glad to see Scratch won't be going out of business any time soon. :)  As for our crepes... they came out to us piping hot, and were absolutely magical. They are lighter and slightly crispier than the ones we tried in France, BUT they had much, much more Nutella than what we got in France. As my cousin and I are both Nutella fiends, we loved this aspect of our crepes.  The presentation was gorgeous (2 Nutella crepes for $6) with a drizzling of cinnamon over the top. The crepes are stuffed with Nutella, so break out your napkin and maybe order one of their French coffees to go with...  Absolutely satisfying. The next time my cousin and I need to get our Nutella-crepe fix, we will return to Scratch! Their cupcakes and coffees/hot chocolates also look amazing, once we saw what other people were ordering and eating. Very good food for the price!

Called Epic on a Monday and was able to get an appointment on Thursday, which was awesome.   Some of the things we really liked: 1) Fast - it only took them about an hour to clean 5 medium-sized rooms, and they arrived within the time frame they said they would. 2) No up-selling - woo! 3) They were able to get us an appointment quickly.  The bad? 1) Brent said that if we paid in cash, we would get a Yelp discount of 5%. Well, we had cash, and our price came to $164 with the discount. However, we gave them $180 and they DIDN'T have change... so we basically paid the regular price. We had told Brent in advance that we would be paying in cash, and how do you not have any change? Granted, it wasn't Brent who was there, but still... a little shady. I guess the guys got a good tip... 2) The guys didn't have any coasters because some old person before us made the poor kids move his ENTIRE house... and put it back, with coasters. So by the time the guys got to our house, they weren't able to put back our furniture because they didn't have any coasters.  Not to mention, my boyfriend had moved literally all of our furniture into the garage, so the guys didn't have to do any work moving anything (well, they and my boyfriend moved one couch that was in the way... one... couch.) Soooo I understand we tip, but I think the not having cash and having to tip more than we would have was a little unfair.  HOWEVER, we would and will definitely use Epic Carpet again because Epic is professional and doesn't hassle you. Not getting hassled by scammy companies is totally worth it to me, so thank you, Epic!

Just got a letter from the Epic owner, Brent, which was very nice, and rather surprising. How often do you hear from owners of companies?? Brent addressed my concerns (viewable below) AND even sent us a $16 check to make up for our lack of a discount.   It's very impressive that a company pays attention to its reviews (Yelp or otherwise) and tries to address those concerns. As I mentioned in my first review below, I would have definitely used Epic in the future, but after Brent's thoughtful and polite letter to us, I plan on using Epic sooner than I planned, and I have gone out of my way to mention this company to co-workers and friends. In fact, people haven't believed me that an OWNER of a company actually apologized, so I have to show them the letter. Excellent customer service!  And just to confirm: I honestly did not even have a problem with Epic cleaners when it came to the actual CLEANING. They did an absolutely fantastic job, with no up-sell, and they got the icky pet smell out of our carpet like pros.   Epic is the antithesis of a shady company-- Brent truly cares about his customers and, even as a cynical city girl, I really appreciate Brent's dedication to his business and customers. There is absolutely no reason not to use Epic Carpet & Tile Care, and now that you know the owner truly cares about his customers, this should be the ONLY Carpet and Tile Care place you use!

I've been to the D'licious Dish twice in one month already, and both times with my mom/both parents. If you knew how picky my parents are when it comes to food, you would realize just how epic our visits have been.  The first time I went to the D'licious Dish was on accident. I was supposed to meet my Mom next door at the Two Hippies pizza place, but it was too crowded for her, so she decided to look in at the Dish. And thank goodness! She had the Caprese sandwich (mozzarella, basil?, and tomato, served warm and with a phenomenal dipping sauce) and I had the roasted veggie sandwich, which was packed with so many veggies, I had to take part of the meal home!  The best part about the Dish is that for the price, you get a huge meal. Not only are there tons of options for sandwiches, but you also can choose a 'side' with your sandwich. There are a ton of sides to choose from, from potato salad, egg salad, veggie salad, fruit salad... and those are just the ones my family/friends have tried!  The next time we went, I had the tuna sandwich, which was a little too salty for my taste unfortunately. Dad had the Tuna Melt sandwich on sourdough, and he couldn't stop raving about it. My friend had the roast beef sandwich, and he couldn't believe how much food we all got at such a reasonable price.  My favorite part of the Dish (and what bumps it up to 5 stars) is the vast selection of sweet treats they have. Again, the price is incredible for what you get. The cookies were (I believe) a dollar each, but they were big and very flavorful. My parents also tried some of the chocolate confections made by the San Francisco treat company (I'm getting the name wrong, but it's approx.) SO decadent--the 3 of us split the brownie and it was almost too much to finish!  The Dish is definitely a place my family will be going to a lot in the future! For the choices, price, and delicious array of chocolates and other goodies, I highly recommend the Dish!

My family and I still go here all the time, and it is still amazing. Now it's our fall back place if we can't decide what to eat, or if we're too lazy to cook something, or if we have guests and we want to take them to a "special" place.  Yes, this is the "special" place we bring guests to... because it's that amazing! Everyone can find something to eat here, from hardcore meat-eaters to die-hard vegans. Soooo good.  Basically, my update on this place is that it's so amazing, it's a continuous fall back place for my family and me to go to when we're in a pinch or when we can't agree on anything else. Yum!

JUST visited the Greek Pita a week ago, after driving past it for the past year and a half.  It was pretty worth it!  The bf and I have to give it a 3 1/2 stars... 3 from the BF and 4 from me (so it's a 4 on Yelp ;)  We each had the falafel pita with french fries. The bf said the falafel was too dry for him, but I found it pretty decent. My only complaint was that there was too much tahini sauce in my falafel, yet not enough in the bf's... we probably should have traded!  Other than that, I thought the pita was absolutely delicious. The fries were so-so, don't think I will order them in the future.  That said, the ambiance of The Greek Pita is really cool-it's well decorated and nicely set up. Lots of seating, lots of booths to make it semi-private. It's also really cool to see them shaving the gyro meat right in the kitchen! I mean, I'm not a meat eater, but the bf thought it was cool, so you know... if you're into that...  It's fairly well priced-- about $8 falafel and fries plate. Bf thought it was a little expensive for the quality, but I would imagine that's about average.  We will definitely be going again-- next on our list is the gyro for him, and the hummus platter for me!

I had been dying to try True Food Kitchen for a while now, after seeing reviews on it on various people's "Vegetarian" lists. I was even more psyched to see that it not only is close to where I live, but also took the place of that awful Coffee Plantation spot in the Biltmore! Yay!  I went with my somewhat reluctant meat-eating boyfriend, but he was quickly won over with their expansive alcohol menu and their plethora of meat dishes- all either local or organic. A place we can both agree on!  I ordered the honey lemonade ($3) which was the perfect balance between tart and sweet-- honey is a great sweetener! I was brought a refill just when my glass became less than half full-- bonus!  We also ordered the hummus appetizer (~$8), which we both enjoyed immensely. My boyfriend liked the tart olives and feta cheese, whereas I loved the cucumbers! There was more hummus left over as our pita bread slices dwindled, but that just means we loaded up our pieces!  For my main course, I had the TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce, and Tomato) ($9), which I really enjoyed. The tempeh was pretty crunchy, but it was balanced by the smooth avocado slices. The boyfriend ordered the Organic Ravioli with Ricotta cheese and kale pesto (~$13), which was super good! It came with 6 pieces of ravioli, which he thought was not enough at first, but after he cleaned his plate he said he was "stuffed." Good sign!! The plate also comes with a ton of meaty mushrooms, which made it even better in my opinion.   We definitely did not have room for dessert, but I've heard mixed reviews of the desserts so I'm not sure if that's something we'll end up trying. Our server was extremely attentive to us, did not pressure us into ordering anything extra, and was prompt in refilling water glasses, answering questions, and bringing the check.  The atmosphere is interesting- a mix of well-dressed business and retired people (think: khaki pants, button up shirts, sweater vests (in the winter); nurses just off work; people coming in for happy hour (jeans and nice shirts); and people just in off the street (shorts, casual shirts, even hats). I really liked this ambiance, because it doesn't make it too stuffy and turn people "off" of this locally grown, organic restaurant concept.  We would definitely be back in a heartbeat, but the only reason I marked it down was because we were sitting underneath their funky lights, and a spider fell out of the light on to my boyfriend's arm. He wasn't terribly bothered by it (other than 'wtf, why is there a spider on my arm?') but I would have freaked out. So... don't sit under the lights, if you can help it!

Omg, Loving Hut, you are so delicious!! You need to be next to my house, feeding me all the things on your menu all the time!! Yes, I would be the size of a house! No, I do not care!  Oh, hey there, Yelp reader....  Everything is vegan. You must know this up front. That means: NO meat, NO dairy, NO animal products. You must not be like my Dad and repeatedly say, 'This isn't a burger! There's no MEAT in it!' No, Dad, you knew this going in. Stop it, you're embarrassing me.  Don't be that guy.  That said: the menu is huge. American food (burgers, spaghetti (wait, that might be considered Italian), chicken nuggets); Chinese food (chow mein, sweet and sour tofu, miso soup); Indian food (curry and whatnot). Lots of stuff. I can't remember it all! Go look at their menu online; they have PICTURES!  I've been to the Loving Hut in San Francisco, so I know this stuff is good. This time I got the curry fried rice (Guru Rice I think it was called?). Spicy and delicious, just like I like it! Sprinkled with small chunks of tofu. I would have preferred larger chunks, but that's just me.  My Dad got brown rice because he is a big baby. He liked it.  My boyfriend got the sweet and sour tofu, and he LOVED it. He said it was the perfect combination of sweet and sour, but it leaned more sweet (which he prefers).  My Mom was sadly disappointed by her Buddy Burger-- she said it was too chewy. She did, however, love the 'Golden Nuggets' (aka 'chicken' nuggets) w/ sweet ketchup, and she loved her french fries. I tried the french fries-- personally, I recommend you add some more salt, but again, that's just me.  The prices are reasonable-- $5.50 for Mom's burger and $7.50 for my fried rice dish. The portions are big, in my opinion, so I found the prices fair. I even have leftovers!  Grab a menu when you come in, choose what you'd like, go to the front counter and order what you want by number (each meal is numbered). If you can't decide, like me, go with something that has a heart-shape next to it-- that means it's a House Favorite and you practically can't go wrong!  Loving Hut prefers you pay in cash (they have an explanation for it, read it if you want), but they absolutely accept credit and debit cards.  This location is on the corner of 35th Ave. and Union Hills, at the very end of the row closest to 35th Ave.  I'm a vegetarian, wannabe vegan, and my Mom is a vegetarian as well. However, my Dad and his prejudices aside, this IS a place you can take your non-veggie friends and family to as well. The layout is clean and it's not like it shoves vegetarianism down your throat (that might not be the best analogy...). You know what I mean. Don't be afraid to bring your non-veggie friends to this place, that's all I'm saying. :)

Love, love, LOVE Gallo Blanco! I discovered this cute little hotel restaurant when I lived around the corner in one of those dodgy apartment complexes, and now it's become one of my "go-to" places.  The bf and I went here last night for our anniversary (yeah, we love it), and we scored with the Happy Hour prices!  One thing-- GET THE GUACAMOLE!! I don't know exactly what is in it (other than avocado and tomatoes), but it is so good. Legit guacamole for sure! Also, I have no idea what the commenter below was smoking, but the chips at this place are AWESOME! You can tell the chips are homemade from tortillas-- thick and crunchy and NOT greasy!  Also, their sangrias are really tasty and strong! $5 during Happy Hour... you know you want it!  I got the veggie tacos last night (2 @ $1.25 a piece) and damn were they good. I love the way they make their corn tortillas-- light and fluffy and full of flavor. The tacos were really good too-- stuffed full of grilled veggies, pico de gallo, and more of that incredible guacamole!  I'm not a big eater, so you might want to get more than one... or do what we did, and order drinks and an appetizer. Yum :)  The bf got two carne asada tacos and one pork taco... he actually couldn't choose which one he liked more! He said the carne tacos were "very flavorful" but the pork tacos were "really tender"... basically, he loved both of them.  We haven't tried dessert at Gallo Blanco (we go elsewhere for our desserts!) but I'm sure they're not half bad.  The ambiance at the Clarendon is really nice-- the restaurant itself is secluded from the hotel and is very open air concept-y... big windows so you can see outside (you can sit outside too!) and low tables inside so you have a great view of the whole restaurant.  Also, as for dress... we saw all kinds of things. People in jeans and t-shirts, people in fancy clothes (again, we were there during Happy Hour so a lot of people had come straight from work), and some people in cocktail dresses. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is dressing formally (suit, prom dress). It's not that kind of place.

Michelle and Two Sparks Electric came really highly recommend, and this would have been a 5 star review if we hadn't just discovered what we discovered right now...  Unfortunately, while Michelle was in our attic, she broke the pipe connected to our air conditioner. This led to a slow leak in our attic, which we then discovered when we used our guest bathroom.   Now, in Michelle's defense, the pipe was old and fragile and easy to miss. It's inevitable it would have broken eventually on its own.  However, my boyfriend told Michelle about the air conditioner, and he let her know there was an alternate crawl space area she could have used that would have bypassed the A/C unit. She may have thought she was small enough to step over the A/C, but that's unfortunately not what happened.  Other than this, Michelle did do great work and was very reasonably priced. We had her wire for fans in our house.   Broken A/C pipe aside, I would recommend Michelle and Two Sparks Electric, and we would definitely use her services again. She's prompt, thorough, friendly and competent. You may just want to strongly advise her if you have an older house and older A/C unit. (Note: we fixed the pipe ourselves in under 2 hours. So, not a big deal, but the boyfriend is also fairly handy. Just something to keep in mind!)

I vacillate between giving this store a 3 or a 4, so I'm going to round up and hope my future trips are more successful :)  I'd been meaning to check out PLRG for... forever... and finally, after 'liking' them on Facebook (recommended!) I visited them this afternoon!  At first when we walked in, no one greeted us, which I was like :-/ about, but it turns out one of the ladies was on break and the other one was helping a customer. When the one lady returned from break, she immediately greeted us and offered to take my finds to the fitting room. Thanks, nice lady!  The store is small but well laid out, and very organized. If you are a 'small' or 'large' size, I'd almost recommend -not- going though... they have a HUGE selection of 'medium' tops, and a very good selection of size 4-10 skirts, but almost nothing for the large or small out there (whatever that definition means to you).  Their workout clothes selection is small, but growing, and they have great brands-- mostly lucy, but others as well. They also have a variety of sizes in the workout section, so it's worth a look.  Luckily, I'm a medium size (thanks, body!) and I found a lot of great stuff-- everything is in excellent condition, and the reviewers below are NOT joking when they say this is quality, name-brand stuff- Banana Republic, Ann Taylor, Inc... just a few examples of the stuff PLRG has!  Unfortunately, I only made out with 2 blouses-- really, the price got to me. This is NOT anything against PLRG, I just didn't want to spend any more money on things that I wasn't like :-D about.  I recommend following PLRG on Facebook-- they post multiple times a day and, if you see something you like, you can call them and request them to hold it for you until the end of the day.  If you happen to have some free time, make a day of it! Get some tea or a coffee at Luci's around the corner, shop and/or consign at PLRG, and then (after you're done trying things on), get a cupcake at the cupcake place next door! Hooray for 16th St. and Bethany!  I'll be back and hopefully will find more things that make me go :-D!

PLRG!! You are still a 4 in my book, but that doesn't mean I don't love you! I DO love you!  Updates for the fellow Yelpers: PLRG's 'large' and 'small' sections have expanded GREATLY! If you are anything less than a ~6 or higher than a ~10, you do actually have more options! HOORAY!!  Also, their workout section has expanded as well, and it is TERRIFIC. I didn't buy any athletic clothes because I enjoy wearing my disgusting old college t-shirts to the gym, but I did peruse the section and found it to be well-stocked. Yay! Lulu, lucy, Nike, I think I saw Adidas but I can't say for certain... lots of good name brand stuff.  Their shoe selection is phenomenal- I almost walked out with a pair of beautiful boots, but lucky for my wallet, they were a size too big.  As usual, their purse selection is, in my opinion, the best part of the whole store. I could not resist one of their purses, so sorry to my bank account... but it was so worth it!  One recommendation: SIGN UP to receive their emails and 'like' them on Facebook. They post their newest acquisitions on Facebook throughout the day, which is how I first fell in love with my newest purse. So this could be a good thing or a bad thing... anyway, loving PLRG, just wish I had more money!

So just to let you know, all the 37 filtered reviews below give this company five stars. Yes, ALL THIRTY-SEVEN people. If you don't believe me, feel free to check. Otherwise, trust me when I say I read through all of them.  Anyway, I really don't have too much to add other than to say this company is AWESOME, and I won't use any other company for my auto-glass needs.  Kelly, the owner, is friendly and to the point, and promptly took care of my insurance to handle the windshield replacement claim. Freddy, the installer, arrived 1/2 an hour ahead of schedule (when does that EVER happen???) and was done within an hour. Score!  Freddy even moved the oil-change stickers from my old windshield to the new glass, which I thought was very thoughtful and indicative of a company that thinks of truly everything.  Although I didn't mention it, Kelly reminded me of the $50 rebate check promo they're doing right now. If you get your windshield replaced by Blue Chip, they will send you a live check for $50... nope, not a gift card or even a Visa prepaid card, but an actual check to do whatever you want with. Umm... EXTRA awesome!

Yogurtology is the best!! Seriously, we live a solid 20 minutes away with no traffic, and I refuse to go anywhere else. For real... the boyfriend one time mentioned visiting another yogurt place near our house, and I told him talk like that was grounds for breaking up. I don't play when it comes to frozen yogurt...  Threats aside, this place is awesome. Once upon a time, the place was an old ice cream shop, so I see they converted it well (basically looks the same). Next to the Souper Salad and My Sister's Closet, parking is awesome and there is generally enough seating inside (with overflow chairs/tables outside).  Different flavors every single time we come here-- staples obviously are vanilla and chocolate, and they usually offer some type of sugar-free frozen yogurt option too, if you want/need that.  Toppings are varied and plentiful-- I'm a chocolate lover, so I always go for the Twix, chocolate sprinkles, and whatever else strikes my fancy. They also have crushed Andes occasionally, cherries all the time, plus mochi, coconut flakes, crushed Reese's Pieces... and toppings like Peanut Butter Sauce, Nutella, Marshmallow Fluff, Chocolate Syrup...  Pretty much if you can imagine it, they probably have it as a toppings. I'm not a fruit girl, but I know they always have kiwis, strawberries... maybe blueberries? Not sure, but they have a TON of fruit options as well as chocolate toppings :)  The place is bright white and very clean inside. I've never seen toppings splattered around, and although the outside tables can get a little messy, the inside tables generally stay pretty clean.  It seems like high school kid workers rotate in and out on a regular basis, so I can't say I have a favorite Yogurtology worker, but everyone there is really nice, friendly, and helpful.   One of the things that first made us love Yogurtology is how friendly and nice the workers are there. If you've never been before, they walk you through the process and offer you a ton of free samples. Very pleasant!  We basically go here once a week... if not more ;) If you're like us, sign up for their frequent member card - you get discounts like $3 off or a free yogurt. It's worth it!

I used to love this Yogurtology (see: glowing review below.) But now? I'll never be back.  Over the past month and a half, I've gone to Yogurtology 3 times (I'd be there more, but I live a solid 20 min. away with no traffic-- but it was really that good!)  During those 3 visits, I was treated rudely, ignored, and basically given the impression that my business was not wanted. What happened? Apparently, the same boy works every single day I've gone (and yes, he's a boy... obviously not even out of high school). He's rude, often has his friends in the shop, and is incompetent.  The high school students Yogurtology used to hire were great-- there was one guy in particular who was funny, outgoing, and gave the place energy! But not anymore.  First time I went-- no place to sit because this kid/worker's friends had taken all the inside spots. Not only were they taking a bunch of free samples, they were also loudly talking about how girls are all "hoes" and how ugly "hoes" are the worst-- come on, seriously??? In Yogurtology where there are children??  Second time-- no place to sit because this kid hadn't bothered off to clean off all the sticky tables. I literally had to eat my froyo in the car because there was no CLEAN place to sit.  This last time (today)?: Kid gave free samples to 3 people (a small family) standing in front of us. When my boyfriend and I walked up to ask him about trying the 'Spicy Banana Mango' (because seriously, who doesn't want to sample that???) he ignored us and walked away behind the counter.  Given all the other frozen yogurt shops closer to where I live, this is an incredibly stupid move for Yogurtology. Hire some real workers and fire this clown who obviously doesn't care enough to do his job right.  I will never, ever be back.

My goodness, I almost wasn't going to review this place (it's just a cupcake shop, should have good enough reviews), but really??? 3 stars??? Come on...  First of all, if you think their frosting is just as good or worse than 'funfetti frosting', please don't ever go to a cupcake shop again. Do us all a favor and go back to making cupcakes in your basement and leave the cupcake bakery reviewing to the adults.  I bought: one Chocolate Peanut Butter cupcake, one Lemon cupcake, one Chocolate Chip cupcake, and one German Chocolate Cake cupcake. I also wanted to buy: one Blueberry cupcake, one Strawberry cupcake, one Red Velvet cupcake... the list goes on.  First impressions: yes, the environment is 'sterile'. Sure, they could jazz up the walls with some decorations or whatever tickles your fancy, but they haven't. Go eat your cupcake at home, or in a park, if you want scenery. SMH here, people.  There is: a display of cupcakes. Seating, Walls. A fridge with milk in it. A cash register. A human to serve you. Standard bakery fare, I imagine. I found it fine and, daresay, completely acceptable for a cupcake shop. No, it's not like that cupcake shop in Vegas in between the Luxor and the other ones (yes, I've been there, no, I didn't review it, it was okay). But you're also in Vegas and those cupcakes were like $6 so...  It took 10 seconds for the nice lady to come and greet us. No, I didn't mentally count 10 seconds in my head because I was too busy being WOWED BY THE OPTIONS.  The cupcakes were $3.50. Apparently they've been $3.50 since at least 2011, so if this is still surprising to you... I don't really know what to say.  4 different people ate these cupcakes (all adults). I only got to try one (my own), because everyone had inhaled their cupcakes and didn't wait for me to finish pouring my milk. In my family, it's an incredible sign that I didn't get to try any other cupcake because my family members aren't fans of sweets and there's usually something always left over for me. No, THAT'S how delicious my family found these cupcakes.  All 4 adults enjoyed the heck out of their cupcakes (flavorful, moist, etc.), asked when I could purchase them more cupcakes from Cupcakes by Design, and one of them even demanded Cupcakes by Design for their birthday (okay, that was me).   Not one adult compared the frosting to funfetti, because God help the adult who compares $3.50 homemade cupcakes I just bought to cupcakes from a box!!  I personally liked the fact that the frosting didn't overwhelm the cupcake, but would I have complained if it did? NO, because that frosting was damn tasty, and I don't begrudge tasty frosting!  There's parking out front especially reserved for Cupcakes by Design, which is handy when Luci's customers have taken every single spot out front.  4 stars because it's a cupcake shop, I liked the cupcakes, and so did everyone else. I'll be back as soon as I'm in the area, and I hope Cupcakes by Design stays in business. They're worth $3.50 and they're worth you trying, even just once.

We went here during one of the crazy rainy days Phoenix rarely has, and although it was a Friday, there was hardly anyone here! I can't say that this is representative of every Friday night though; I think the rain kept people away.  While I can't comment on the Friday night atmosphere due to that reason, I can say: WOW to the food! As reviewers have noted, the pretzel bread is killer. Get it!!! I got the shrimp BLT (minus the BLT, I know it's sacrilege but I don't eat bacon) - SO good! My boyfriend got the chicken sandwich with the pretzel bread and he loved it. I wish I had the pretzel bread on mine... next time!  The best part to me was happy hour - SUCH good prices. We walked out of the bar spending less than $5 on drinks (granted, one of us was the DD, so only one person was drinking, but still. $5!!!) Speaking of driving, parking's actually not that bad. Parking downtown is free after 5 p.m., and there is plenty of street parking all around Bliss.  I can't wait to go back to Bliss when it's a little more crowded - we had awesome service from the staff, but I'd like to test it when it's busier. I LOVE the happy hour prices and can't wait to try the mac and cheese- people around us ordered it, and it looked HUGE. Yum!

Like Stephanie F., we had MANY, many failed attempts at getting good landscapers, we finally found (and now love) Macias Landscaping.  Today we were in a pickle: Our landscaping crew pulled a no-show, so we had no one to remove a big tree in the middle of a yard. To top it off, we were having rocks delivered within hours and -really- needed this tree gone!  We called Macias (plus a dozen other companies) and Macias Landscaping was the ONLY company to pick up on the first ring (good sign of a quality company that wants your business!)  Not only did Macias Landscaping show up within 2 hours, they charged us an incredibly reasonable price AND were done within an hour.  The crew was professional, hard-working, friendly, and very competent. I can't speak highly enough of Macias Landscaping-- they saved our butts AND were the best priced out of all the companies we called. I can't thank them enough-- they also saved my sanity! :)

Wow, I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet! I guess it opened earlier this year, so that might explain it...  I bought 2 Groupon-type coupons for massages for my boyfriend and me, and we redeemed them 3 weeks ago. Without the coupon, the massages would have been pricey (to me! around ~$100, not including tip). I haven't been to Massage Envy in a while, so I don't remember if this is cheaper or more expensive, but the ambiance at Athena's Temple is certainly VERY different from Massage Envy.  Personally, I'm a fan of spas that have an inviting atmosphere, dim lighting, and soothing music. Massage Envy does none of this for me, as I constantly feel I'm being sold something and bombarded with lights and noise.  Athena's Temple is completely different. Yes, it's in a strip mall, but one of the artfully designed ones you'll find in Scottsdale. It's not really too difficult to find. Also, once you get inside, you completely forget where you are (in a good way!)  When we arrived, we were the only ones in the day spa, and when we finished an hour later, there was only one other client there getting a pedicure. This was great for us, as we were checked in promptly and brought 2 glasses of water before our treatments.  The spa is laid out very nicely: when you walk in, you'll notice the big water fountain/rock waterfall near the waiting area. On the left side, there are chairs for the hairstylists, and on the right side, nail stations for the nail technicians.  In the back is where the pedicure chairs are, as well as the massage rooms.   As for the massages... WONDERFUL! My massage lady persuaded me to try the coconut oil over the lotion, which I'm really glad I did! I smelled like an Almond Joy for hours... it was awesome! My lady did chat with me a little more than I would have liked, but it was an interesting conversation so I didn't mind too much.  My boyfriend loved his massage, and apparently his masseuse did not talk to him at all, so he got a short nap. Apparently you have to be pretty explicit about what you do want worked on-- I forgot to remind my masseuse to work on my arms/hands, but my boyfriend did and he said it was incredible.  The amount of pressure was perfect for both of us, and we both have very different tastes, so that was pretty great! The ladies at the front desk were efficient and friendly. All in all, this day spa is beautiful, clean, and seems to have all the amenities you would expect from a spa. I give it an extra star for having that 'charm' factor by really playing up the Athena's Temple theme with the waterfall/rock garden.

If I could give this place minus stars, I would.  Listen, do yourself a favor. After reading my review, READ THE FILTERED REVIEWS! I am very disappointed in Yelp for filtering NINE reviews that all gave this place one star. 9 reviews with one star is a huge red flag, and Yelp is doing a disservice to everyone trying to investigate Anytime Garage Doors.  Anyway, I digress. THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE. Horrible, horrible, horrible.  1) They are NOT BBB accredited, their website is lying and they have been asked by the BBB to take that logo down. Red Flag #1. 2) Earlier this year, AGD's contractor's license had been suspended by the Registrar of Contractors. Red Flag #2. 3) They were investigated by 3 On Your Side for overcharging customers for absolutely frivolous things (read it here: http://www.azfamily.com/news/consumer/Anytime-Garage-Doors-Resolves-Dispute-Over-Repair-Bill-140899703.html)  As for our experience... absolutely horrendous. We are new homeowners, and I wanted a clicker to open the garage door. Yes, we should have checked online to see how much clickers go for, but we noticed AGD's sticker on our garage door and thought that replacing a clicker would be of little cost or even free.  Oh, how terribly, terribly wrong we were. First, we had a gem named "Paul" come out (seems like he's the only con artist who works there). "Paul" cursed the entire time he was setting up our clicker (which took all of 10 minutes), as if programming a clicker was so hard and we were such annoying customers. Red Flag #3.  While Paul was writing our ticket up, he proceeded to pull out a cigarette and puff away... right next to the open door in our house. Hey, jerk, some people are allergic to smoke and, go figure, it's UNPROFESSIONAL to smoke while making a service call! (I'm not even redflagging this because it's so ridiculous).  Then "Paul" tells us (just to program a clicker, mind you) it will be $120. ONE. HUNDRED. AND. TWENTY. DOLLARS. For a CLICKER.  At this point, we said absolutely not and started walking away. Then Paul starts whining like a petulant child about how we "said" we'd pay $65 (which we did, but that's before we realized how basically a moron could program a clicker... naive homeowners, we were.)  Then when we told him even $65 was too much for basically something that an armless monkey could do, he whined that we would still have to pay him "$25 for the service call."  F.M.L. We finally just decided to pay the $65 that he originally quoted us because we just wanted that damn clicker, but it left a sour taste is our mouths.  Lesson learned: buy a clicker on Amazon.com and watch a Youtube video for how to program it.   NEVER EVER EVER use these people. If you decide to use them, buyer beware. Seriously, just type in the word "garage" on the Yelp search bar and look for higher rated garage companies. DO SOME RESEARCH. We certainly learned a painful and expensive lesson.

Omg, I LOVE this place!!! Can that be enough for you, or must I add more? :)  Here's a rundown of Yogurtini's awesomeness: 1) Free samples until you DIE! (Or until you run out of those little free sample cone-things...) 2) Tons of flavors!!! My faves?: Cheesecake, Peanut Butter, Chocolate, and Red Velvet. The bf likes Vanilla and the Dulce de Leche (it's really sweet!) 3) Tons of toppings!! Lots of fruit, weird random cereal toppings (Cap'n Crunch, holla!), granola, etc. 4) Good price! Two small sized bowls filled to the top (and stuffed with toppings) are just under $8 (and you will be full, trust me) 5) Loyalty card!! Doooo it.... 6) The staff are friendly and nice, and they know what they're doing. I've never had a problem with them being rude or catering to their friends over paying customers, which is more than I can say for some froyo places (coughYogurtologycough)  There's nothing about this place I don't absolutely love!

First things first: the best way to get into this place (if, by some weird reason, you're only driving to the mall to visit this shop) is to park in the Nordstrom's garage (third floor, if you can), walk across the bridge, walk through the teen/kids sections, and hang a left. There it is! Very easy and less walking, for the lazy folks out there ;)  I mention that because I visited Fashion Square yesterday to ONLY visit Caketini-- yes, that's right, I didn't go shopping (crazy!).  Anyway-- the service at Caketini is unbelievably good. THREE people tried to cut in front of me in line (wtf??) but the Caketini girls noticed me and made a point to pick me out of the crowd, take my order, and get it to me in a very timely manner. Hooray for good customer service!  As for the treats: I tried 2 "Caketini truffles" (AKA cake pops) (brought one home for the bf) and a Jasmine Blueberry organic iced tea.  Verdict? DELICIOUS! I tried the peanut butter cake pop and the 'celebration' cake pop, and the boyfriend had the snickerdoodle cake pop. All three were moist, not at all dry, and not at all "too sweet." To each, their own tastes, but I don't really understand the complaints about Caketini's flavors... they're actually better than Starbucks, and having said that, I think it's unfair to compare Caketini to Starbucks...  But I digress. The iced tea itself was also amazing-- only $2.50 for a large iced tea that tastes EXACTLY like a Teavana iced tea.... only at much cheaper prices. If you've had Teavana iced tea, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't... let's just say, you can't compare Starbucks iced tea to Teavana tea.  (and before you think I hate Starbucks, I don't. I'm just saying you can't compare apples to oranges :)  All in all, I'm looking forward to stopping at Caketini any time I'm at Fashion Square. It's worth a visit to Caketini if you're at the mall!

I don't really know how I can review this bar without using expletives, but for your tender eyes, Yelpers, I'll try.  First of all-- this place isn't Casey Jones which, in my opinion, is a shame. Casey Jones used to be that awesome neighborhood bar you'd walk into, order some good, cheap, and stiff drinks, and watch the fights. Shoot, you could watch the fights, you could play pool, you could watch any game you wanted to, and the waitresses were prompt and knew their drinks.  My boyfriend and I went last night to Daddy-O's (UFC fight night, btw), and guess what? Half the TVs weren't on, and of course they were NOT showing the fights. When we asked the lady behind the bar about the fights, she just shrugged at us. (ok...??)  Needless to say, Daddy-O's was dead, except for maybe a handful of people (including us). Hmmm... maybe TURN ON SOME TVs??? You don't have to play the fights if you're too cheap to pay for it, but for God's sake, at least play the Olympics! Come on!  On to the drinks-- ha, what a joke. The waitresses don't even know what drinks they have, our girl didn't even know what a "Washington Apple shooter" was... so... yeah. No drink specials at all.  We've gone on a Saturday and also one another time during Happy Hour, and both times they weren't doing ANY drink specials. Hmm.. again... maybe to drive in business, you should have drink specials?? Go figure! (Maybe I should run this bar.)  Long story short: We'll never be back, which is a shame, because it's right around the corner from our house and USED to be amazing. But no games, no good vibes, no drink specials... you can do better at places down the road!

I'm going to give this place 2 stars instead of 1 because I'm going to return and... I have hope, you guys, I really do...  BUT... went here last Friday at lunchtime. Pulled up, place seemed extraordinarily sketchy, but my work friend and I were game. We parked and walked up only to find the place completely boarded up. There was spray paint that read 'Closed' on one of the doors-- is the place closed??  I heard people inside, so I walked over to the other door, which had a sign stating their hours. Too bad their hours were covered up with Sharpie-drawn hearts. What???  I tried to pull open the door, since I heard people inside the house/shack/restaurant, but the door must have been locked or rusted shut, because I couldn't open it.  We tried to find their hours online a head of time, but the website... dear Lord. Please invest in a friend or someone to update and fix whatever that mess is!  So, no I didn't get to eat at Aside of Heart. I have no idea when they're open, although according to Yelp it's 24/7.  I typically don't review places I haven't tried, but I'm asking for help here-- what is going on with this place?  My work friend and I are vegetarian, so like I said, we will be returning. Probably not on a Friday- maybe they're closed Fridays? We'll try it on a Wednesday...  Until then-- maybe someone could message me and give me a heads up when their hours are?? I'd really like to go!

Woohoo, I finally visit a place that's newly opened! Ahead of the curve for once! :)  Visited Federal Pizza after the great review from Chow Bella (I think...) regarding the Corn Coins. Went after work on a Thursday, and while the place was very busy, my friend and I were seated immediately.  Service was a little slow, but, like I said, it was very busy. Plus, the extra time gave us plenty of time to debate the menu and choose what we wanted!  We ended up ordering the At Last pizza, Corn Coins, and wine coolers (I had the hibiscus one-- delicious!)  The pizza was GREAT!! It has chiles on it, which adds a little spice and unexpected flavor. The crust held all the veggies really well, but the veggies didn't even overwhelm the pizza. All in all, great!  My friend didn't exactly like the thin crust, but as long as you know it's thinner crust pizza going in, you should be okay.  Disappointing? The Corn Coins. They got a great review from the New Times, but I just didn't like them. I don't know what I was expecting, but they were messy to eat, corn got all up in our teeth, and it was just generally 'meh.' If you love corn, or know what you're getting into with corn coins, go for it! I just wouldn't order it again. Also-- NOT recommended for first dates!  Unexpectedly amazing? The WINE COOLERS! Oh yeah buddy! They bring you the wine cooler in an old school glass bottle that you then pour yourself into a wine glass filled with ice.  My (raspberry? can't remember) hibiscus wine cooler was awesome!! Surprisingly strong, and incredibly delicious. I think I'm going to get 5... I mean 2... the next time I go to FP!  It was ~$20 for both of us, with an appetizer, a split pizza, and drinks. The only other thing I wasn't a fan of was the parking... I KNOW the owners of FP (along with their other restaurants) love doing the complimentary valet parking, I'm just not a fan of having to carry dollars around with me for tip. I don't really carry money around at all, and it's just something else to remember.  All said though, I'll go back. Mostly because of those wine coolers :)

So glad I finally got to visit Bragg's - it's close to work AND it's delicious. Such a fan, and I will be back!  Went with a bunch of coworkers, all omnivores (I'm the only veg), and we all (mostly) ordered something different. A rundown:  2 Chickpea burgers with rosemary potatoes: verdict? Delicious! The burger wasn't too dry OR too mushy, which is a real compliment. So many times I've had places try to make their burgers moist, which usually results in a mushy, unappetizing pile. Not Bragg's! They know how to make a solid chickpea burger.  Also, chickpea burger?! So clever, and so much better than the standard black bean burgers I'm used to ordering. Score!  I only wish I had more rosemary potatoes, but that's just me being greedy. They were SO good - on the crunchy side, but I like crunchy potatoes!  One person ordered the ELT (eggplant, lettuce and tomato), and she really liked it. We all tried a side of the eggplant bacon. Now, I don't like eggplant. At all. But this was surprisingly good! It was decently crunchy, but the marinade made it. BBQ-tasting sauce FTW!  On to the good part: the desserts!  Cookies - fabulous. Order them all. Eat all the cookies!!!  Magic bar - all right. I thought it was good, but my bf thought it was a little dry.   Peanut Butter Pie - OMG I'm so glad I only tried a bite, because it was TOO good. Eat all the Peanut Butter Pies good. Get it!  Fruit pies - we ordered two, and I can't for the life of me remember what they were. Not a fruit person (yeah, I know, it's weird). However, the fruit pies were really good! Fresh, fruity, good crust.  Pecan pie - now, I didn't try this one, but I gave it to my parents to try. They said it was too gritty... :-/ I didn't even tell them it was vegan, so I have to assume they're right.  Stick to the fruit and peanut butter pie if you don't want an unhappy surprise. Those I can guarantee!  My total, for a chickpea burger + drink + 1 cookie + magic bar + pecan pie + tip came to $25. Not bad considering how much food I consumed/shared/brought home.   Also, service here is a bit slow but very friendly. Go with a little bit of time to spare, but not a whole lot. Try to go early if you're going at lunch because it gets crowded and there's not a lot of space.  4 stars because I have to go back and give that pecan pie a second chance ;)

We LOVE Bonita's!! Owned by the same wonderful people who own Pullano's, Bonita's is turning into our new favorite place. It's honestly getting hard to choose between Pullano's and Bonita's... but Bonita's wins for those nights we need a quick, convenient meal.  First: the prices at Bonita's are phenomenal. We get a ton of food, plus a drink plus churros, and never walk out of there paying more than $25.  Second: Bonita's is not Taco Bell, nor is it Filiberto's. It is SO much better. Yes, it's fast-casual (meaning you can eat it there or take it to go, it's not a sit-down-and-get-served place), but everything seems to be made fresh and is definitely made to order.  There are way too many items I could recommend to you, but some of our favorites are the bean & cheese burrito, the tacos (any kind) and the CHURROS. I can't say enough about the churros - I've tried churros far and wide, in many different states, and Bonita's is seriously amazing.   Let me repeat: If you don't order the cajeta churro, you are not truly experiencing Bonita's. I don't even care if you're allergic to caramel - try the cajeta churro!! If you don't like it, your tastebuds are officially dead.  So good. Go. You likely won't be disappointed... and you definitely won't be disappointed if you choose that cajeta churro!
