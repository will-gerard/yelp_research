The Heard Museum is a great place to go to learn about Native American/Indian and tribal history. A lot of what you'll find are things taught in history class but I was a bit too obnoxious to pay attention to (as well as everything else in school) remember such things after the test. Visiting here was a nice refresher, and in many instance, a great learning experience.  When I visit museums, I'm always interested in the things that are centuries old. I didn't see much of that there. (And if I actually knew this part of history, there may be an explanation to this.) What I found interesting was (re)learning the adapting cultures, changes, and depictions of Native Americans from both their perspective and with the America they were becoming.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the sections on their education and of course, sports.  If you're a history buff, I would highly recommend going to The Heard Museum for a different perspective on American history.

Wow. I didn't see this one coming... I was expecting a basic hotel room when I was booked to stay there but what I found was a place that I pretty much could live.   Kitchen. Check. (Stove, dishwasher, and refrigerator!) TV. Check. Couch. Check. Big bed. Check. Comfortable, too. Decent sized bathroom. Check.  Yep, give me a place like this and just a few extra hundred square feet and I'm happy! It's like a blueprint for a man cave!  Complimentary breakfast is served each morning. They have a happy hour where they offer free beers and some light bites, which I would skip by the way (the food was no good).  The gym is very small but if you are satisfied with a treadmill and a some 25 lb weights, this should be sufficient to get a little movement.   Overall, a place I would consider staying when I have to visit Scottsdale on a yearly basis.

I had the opportunity to play this course twice while in Scottsdale for a business trip last week. Because the weather is so hot June is a slow time in the golf industry so 1) the cost of playing is dirt cheap and 2) if you don't mind the dry heat, you can play quickly without any waiting since only 60-80 golfers will play throughout the day.  Day 1 - The Palm course. A little bit of water here and there. Greens rolled beautifully. I didn't find this course to be too terribly difficult. Lots of straightaway holes. Most importantly, the course was in great condition. You'll like the front nine better than back nine, mainly because the front nine doesn't have any houses to look at and there weren't any burn spots on the ground.   Day 2 - The Pine course. This course offers a unique setup and with many challenges. The PGA Tour Monday qualifier happens at this course so you already know this course can play long and tough. Lots of water, tighter tee shots, and overall a better course to play, especially if you're a solid golfer.  A few other things to add about McCormick... Their practice facility is top notch. The driving range was full of grass and plush lies while the chipping and putting greens were great for practicing.  There's a full service restaurant inside if you want to grab a bite to eat after your round.   Since we were golfing on back to back days, the staff was so kind to hold on to our golf clubs and shoes overnight in their storage facility. That made it convenient for us!  Lastly, there are a lot of pretty mountain views. Soak it in, brah, soak it in.  A top notch golf course and facility!

I don't know Scottsdale too well but I'm pretty sure there aren't many waterfront views in the city. The joke with Uber drivers when we pass a canal is that there's the waterfront living. Chart House is located close to a golf course and there's a big lake that this restaurant sits on. With this you get a beautiful view of both the golf course and this lake. There isn't much light pollution so if you have the opportunity to sit outside (heat permitting), do so, and enjoy the evening skies.  Immediately upon entering their private dining room, I was excited for the views and what was in store with dinner.  What didn't I love about Chart House?  - Salad bar. Legit.  - Fire roasted shrimp - I took two when people weren't paying attention. - The captain cut prime rib - OMG, so delicious. This cut is 14 oz and now represents two weeks of red meat in my life per doctor orders. I'm glad I used my lifeline with these folks. This was juicy and tender and packed with amazing flavors. - Asparagus served with my rib was great. It's worth adding mushrooms as an additional side, too. - Cheesecake - ya know, service was so stellar that I didn't order the cheesecake. The server heard me say how much I love cheesecake and brought it out for me. I was on another company's tab so I assumed there was a big budget for the night so any conversation on food was assumed that it was an order. In normal circumstances, I assume they would normally ask and confirm before bringing a dessert to you. In this case, I was ecstatic.  It's definitely a fancy restaurant but knowing how hot it gets in AZ you can go casual and not feel out of place. Our party was almost 20 folks and service was impeccable.   I hope to return to Chart House in the future.

Great spot. Definite dive feel. Definite locals feel. A neighborhood gem I was told.  Stopped in for a quick dinner and ordered the salmon cakes with collard greens. Salmon cakes was a new thing to me. Not sure I would ever take something so good and make it into a cake again but I found the dish to be fairly decent. The collard greens tasted fresh. Now... The star of this entire meal was the biscuit and sweet potato. They were part of the main course but damn did I feel like I was enjoying dessert. So good that instead of eating everything together like I normally do I had to save these toe things for last. I highly recommend a visit even for just a biscuit and sweet potato!

If you're interested in maxing out those credit cards, this is the place to go. It's the booshie mall so I was told. Ya know, the place with all the high-end stores that cost you an arm and a leg. And sure enough, I found it to be that way. Among the many popular stores such as Nordstrom, Louis Vuitton, Coach, etc. you get a very clean, bright, and upscale feel to it.  Aldo isn't super costly by any means but damn, I managed to drop three bills on three pairs of shoes.  The surrounding area is also very nice. Within a few miles you'll find some really big houses on really big lots. Close to seven-figure home values if I were to guess. Fitting for a mall that is quite nice. I dig it.. I really hate malls but this one seemed to be a good one I wouldn't mind going to.

A friend once told me that strip clubs don't experience inflation. Back in the 80s he threw out $1 bills. Today, he would still throw out $1 bills. This logic make sense.  Enter Skin Cabaret. I pay for my party to get inside the place. This is a business trip and our chaperone took us to a strip club. (Full disclosure: the girlfriend has given permission to enter into such an establishment. Besides, give me the book on game and a $1,000,000 and I'm still useless in this environment so all bets are safe on me not doing anything stupid.) I receive my change and notice that there are $10 in $2 bills! $2 BILLS? These are still floating around? Did the city of Scottsdale or the governing body of strip clubs lobby for the continued production of $2 bills to combat such inflation my friend spoke of? The 21 year old kid rolling into this place may not even know a $2 bill exists. I would guess all the $2 bills circulating all throughout the United States are in Scottsdale, Arizona and chances are, the $2 bill you are pulling out of your wallet/purse at this moment has touched the lovely thigh/hip skin of a beautiful Scottsdale adult dancer.  True story. After I ran out of $2 bills I kindly exchanged two $1 bills with my chaperone so I can keep one as a souvenir.  By the way, it was a Wednesday and this place came out swinging with some talent. I couldn't even imagine a Friday/Saturday in this place.

Walking by and seeing $32 for a buffet dinner was a little bit of a cost shock to me. Then again it's Las Vegas. I've been here before for lunch and know that the food here is PHENOMENAL. Still not sure I peaked inside, saw crab legs and knew that I was going to get my money's worth. I did it right tonight.  You'll find a nicely decorated restaurant. Pay attention when checking  out the place. A fruit bar, in the middle of the restaurant, is an octopus that comes from the ceiling. How fitting for a sushi joint. The restaurant is well lit, clean and has a hip and trendy yet casual look that fits nicely into Vegas. My guess is that this place gets more than just tourists like me. I'd bet that locals come here quite often.  You'll find all types of sushi: typical California rolls to octopus, to different variations of tuna and salmon rolls.  I had a very significant share of their sashimi. Easily $20 worth served in any sushi restaurant. Their crab legs were not only delicious but the crab meat came out just perfect to dip into their melted butter. I think I had eight raw oysters, an easy $15 in any restaurant back home in Virginia Beach. They even serve hot foods to cater those who are intimated by raw fish. I tried a small piece of their prime rib and really enjoyed their flavorful bacon wrapped asparagus.  I finished off my fat kid adventure with an okay tasting green tea cheesecake. But what I really enjoyed was the strawberry-banana crepe offered in the dessert section made in front of me.  The best part of my trip here was my request for wet naps because of my sloppiness with my crab legs. I was expecting those stupid packaged wet naps you get at the store. Nope. We were given hot wet towels! Simple, but a short and awesome experience after a delicious dinner.  Okay, so I'm not often interested in spending $32 on my any meal but I will certainly come back again...perhaps even on this trip.

Because I didn't get murdered at the craps table. Any casino that doesn't take all your money is a good one in my book.  All jokes aside, this place was clean. It wasn't very smokey inside. Service was on point although the waitress did grab my beer that was half full.  Oh and when it comes to rooms, the view from 2578... the pool, the fountain show, and the Eiffel Tower. Spot on. That's a great place to park your luggage so you can sleep during the day after a night of mad partying.  I could work it to go back to this hotel again.

Some cool cat hanging outside of the doors at Caesar's Palace handed me a pass Sunday night and told me that I could get into this club without paying a cover charge. Sure, I'll save the $20. I was already down from a terrible run at the craps table. Crap!  Just like what I would expect in Vegas...a decent sized dance floor, surrounding VIP sections and beautiful people all over the place. I never go out on Sundays but being in the city that never sleeps I was playing with house time. I was definitely digging the music here. The DJ was playing an awesome mix of hip hop and Top 40 hits. Needless to say, I was gettin' it on the dance floor.  I paid $8 for each Coors Light bottle. A little steep if you ask me but I suppose that is the norm in LV. Good thing that I am a lightweight because this place becomes more fun when the beer vision kicks in.  Just saw a few reviews that said this place has dance floors on different levels. Wish someone told me because I was a one man wolf pack for the night and would have enjoyed checking out the different scenes here. Guess I'll be back here when I'm visiting Sin City again because this place is pure fun.

If you know me and you know me well then you know I love the movie, The Hangover.  Of course, I have to throw out a few references...  Julius Caesar really didn't live there. The place is pager friendly but I'm taking cool points away from you to be on the web reading this review with a pager on your hip. You won't find pay phones here.  I suppose this review is about the gambling experience I had here --- AWESOME. What a really cool place to hangout for the night. From what I understand this place is old but the atmosphere here is amazing. I would have thought that this place was recently built because everything here appears brand new. Everything here is taken care of daily and taken care of well. All things appear brand new to me.  People smoke here but the place doesn't smell like cigarettes. You'll find lots of action going on here even late at night or early in the morning (however you look at it). The dealers at the tables (I'm a craps shooter) are extremely friendly and they made my experience very memorable. You'll find a few different nightclubs here, Pure, being one that I previously reviewed.  One quick funny story. I was here in November 2010 with two friends who wanted to turn $200 into a $1,000 over a few hands of black jack. The dealer, a very old Asian man with a thick accent, spent almost six or seven minutes cutting the cards in front us and didn't say a single word to anyone (I was just watching my friends gamble). I was wondering why the hell it was taking him so long and within five hands and not even five minutes of dealing my buddies were each out $200. I suppose this dealer was trying to provide some sort of experience because dammit Vegas will get you.  I plan on making several more trips in my lifetime to Sin City and will soon not only patronize Caesar's Palace for gambling purposes but for the hotel stay, clubbing and for dining. You must visit this place if you are Las Vegas.

Ugh. I arrive at The Flamingo after traveling for what felt like 12 hours starving my ass off and decide to eat here because my buddy and I were just too exhausted to look elsewhere. Wish we took the 20 minutes to find another place...  Their sign said that their lunch buffet ends at 3pm and at 3:01pm the lady behind the desk gave us the lunch price. Kudos. Walking to our table I immediately noticed a Vegas hotel style restaurant with appealing outside views of a small walkway and a pretty water fountain. Cool. And then it goes downhill...  The only thing that was really good from this buffet were the crab legs. I had a fair share of them but they didn't have an crab leg crackers --- just a small utensil to pick out your crab meat. My task to stuff my face was very difficult. There was a small section open for sushi but the sushi there appeared to have been out for a few hours. All the cooked food appeared and tasted overcooked. They had a build your own nachos section but no chips. I was hoping that I would get at least something decent from the dessert aisle but the cookies were rock hard!  I suppose if you were to come here you should come during peak hours since food is always being shuffled. Looks like we were in the middle of a shift change or menu change from lunch to dinner. This is Las Vegas --- the world's number one tourist attraction. Step it up.

Very classy hotel to say the least. I only enjoyed one night but I will for sure come back for another. First, the place is absolutely gorgeous anywhere you can see it in Vegas. Inside you'll find a very modern looking hotel and casino. The place is quite spacious, clean and gives a refreshing taste as it is one of Vegas' newer hotels.  My favorite part of my stay here was how technologically advanced the hotel is. I walked into my room and it was an automated technological galore. All the lights turned on, my TV turned on and my blinds started to open. I was only on the the third floor, a "lower end" suite, so I know the higher you moved up the nicer the rooms and most likely the better the experience.  It's a different feel from all the other popular hotels in Vegas. You'll find a bit of a seasoned crowd with not too many young folks like me walking around. Apparently there is plenty to do here with nightclubs and shops. I just wish the Haze Club was open while I was here.  Overall, a nice stay and I will win my money back on the craps table! :-)

Story time. (Not a funny one though.)  I'm in Scottsdale. Played golf. Ate dinner. Off to bed. I wake up with some chest pain and difficulty breathing. I got up and moved around. The pain becomes less. Not too long after at 4am (I'm on EST) I take a walk throughout the resort area and find myself in the gym. I'm moving around more and more. Less pain. Before you know it, I'm getting a work out in early for the day. No pain anymore.  I golf at 7:30AM. No pain. I eat lunch. There's some slight pain. The afternoon rolls around. No pain. Go to the pool to get this sexiness tanner. No pain. Evening festivities begin. The pain begins again. I try to get through it. More pain at dinner. More pain for additional evening festivities. The night is over and I feel like gorillas are inside my chest pounding away. I try and sleep. Yeah, right. So much pain. Am I having a heart attack? What in the world is going on?  Time to Uber my sexy ass to the ER. Within 15 minutes around 11:45PM I'm at HonorHealth Medical Center. I check in as to their protocol and shortly after I'm sitting in a bed with attractive people surrounding me. My nurse was pretty attractive. My PA? She made my heart rate go up.  Okay, back to the seriousness of this review.  They asked questions. I gave answers. I provided information. They provided help. I came in with pain. They gave me what I needed and I left without it. These folks were top notch. This was my first visit to the ER and I felt taken care of by everyone. Every person I came across was friendly and attentive. Of course, I asked lots of questions out of curiosity and they took the time to explain everything to me.   Not only did I leave without pain, things are on the up and up (at least that's how I feel), and I am more knowledgeable about the condition I came with in the first place. I left confident and relieved.  I hope to not have to go back to this place but if I have to, I know I'm in good hands with this staff!

Hungry as a horse my buddy and I despite wanting to eat at the first place we saw in the mall opted for pizza here after visiting three other places for lunch today. It was a little after 2pm and after reading a sign that read something along the lines of being the best rated pizza spot we took their advertised word for it.  Ehhhhh... My total bill came out to $11.84 and that was a lunch special. WTH??? It wasn't any sort of gourmet pizza --- typical mall type pizza at beat. What did I get? I got an okay sized slice of a supreme pizza, a mediocre salad and a small sized drink. My guess is that things cost more in Vegas but damn. I had a few beers while rolling dice earlier so eating this filled me up but honestly I would have rather paid $25 for lunch elsewhere.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant was really clean. Being as hungry as we were most things would taste great but as for my experience here, ehhh, I've had better.

Well...  Seriously...  Okay...  Do you ever wonder why people are always walking around in the club? As in the entire time you're there someone is always walking by you? Is it all at one time the entire time that people are doing their people watch laps?  Let's be real. I'm in Scottsdale. Everyone walking around looks a Kardashian. I just want to stand around and stare. But I can't. Someone is always bumping into me. All this is no longer an issue when you know someone. We ended up meeting with a group of folks who had a VIP section. So instead of being in the walkway where everyone was moving around, we're hanging out, sitting around, observing the action, with bottle service, with someone smoking hot pouring drinks for everyone.  Sadly, I wasn't able to drink but I was able to enjoy the scenery.  Girls were dancing on the bar. They dressed rather scandalous. No complaints. Lots of drunk people in the club. Drinks being spilled. People falling all over the place. Loud music and good tracks from the DJ. Say what you want about Miley Cyrus. The place went lit when her Party in the USA hit came on.  I was never into the club scene but a night like this every once in a while is good for the soul. Even better, is at a place like this.

There's only one thing you need to order from Max's... Beef sisig!!! I had it twice while in Las Vegas and every bite was orgasmic. It really and truly was a dish that got my uber excited thinking about it.   Side note --- some of this dish somehow made it home from Las Vegas to Virginia Beach. Translation... I had more beef sisig for tonight's dinner. Translation... The orgasmic sensations continued.  Now if I were to throw in my two cents on everything else, this review would be four stars but when you follow my lead and go for only the beef sisig, you won't be disappointed and I hope you'll feel as excited as I am!

While there is so much about Scottsdale to love, add to this list a Topgolf location! (Soon coming to my hood, Virginia Beach, VA.) This was a nice way for me to finally experience this before having to wait hours and hours of waiting with the soon to open location in my hometown.  This is an experience. For an avid golfer like myself, I sometimes wonder how things like this will fare on a fun scale. Putt putt golf isn't fun. Could this be a glorified driving range? Not so much. It's really just a fun thing to do, golfer or not. Heck, even if you're not a golfer, you can just come out for food and drinks. Think Dave and Buster's with a golf club.  First, it's gorgeous. Lots of green, lots of lighting, lots of bins so you can have endless groups enjoying their time together. You hit into targets and based on how close you get to your target, you're awarded points. For folks that aren't good at golf and simply make contact, the ground is hard enough where your ball can roll into the hole for points (where golf on a golf course requires you to hit the ball in a specific direction and with hazards and natural terrain, a specific distance), thus making it enjoyable for anyone to score and compete in their many games.  The cool thing about playing at this location in the evening is the Talking Stick Resort in the background. Bright and continuously changing and waving lights emit the building and makes for something pretty to look at with the already pretty golf design of the driving range.  Could this be a weekly adventure for me? I think so. :)
