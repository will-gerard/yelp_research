Excellent gyros, very fresh yet still just a little greasy. Not the average prepackaged gyro meat that seems to be served at the majority of Greek places.

Excellent food. They will spice your dishes to your request, so if you don't like spicy be sure to let them know. The chicken tikka masala was perfect.

When I entered the line seemed to bizarrely start at the far end away from the door. I was then informed if i wanted a burger i instead needed to go to a different line which was the only register. This register was manned by what looked to be a twelve year old kid who was insanely slow at his job. He started serving people from the other line before helping me. After ten minutes of waiting, and being cut off multiple times such that I was further behind in line then where I started, and people who arrived after me already getting their food, I just left. The food might be good, I have no idea, I wasn't even allowed to order.
