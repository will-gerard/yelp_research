I used to love this place but now the service has gone downhill, they got rid of their good iced tea and substituted it with some chemical-taating off brand, their prices have gone WAY UP.  $9.75 for a sald with chicken in a stripmall joint is way too much, the waitress was rude and the greek music is sooooooo loud.  They added the suite next store to their dinig room, so they raised all their prices by 2 or 3 dollars each plate to compensate.  I liked them a lot better when thy were smaller, friendlier and didnt cut corners on the food.  Sadly this will be or last time coming here.

Worst pho I have ever had!  The waitress was soooo nice though.  She offered me another kind, but it was bland too.  I love pho and I have it all over the valley.  My husband and I came here to try it due to all the reviews, but honestly we hated it.  We ended up leaving and going somewhere else for good pho.  The pho here was tasteless, T)the broth had no flavor or aroma.  It was like hot water with noodles in it and two shrimp and one scallop.  My husband had the beef pho and I had the seafood pho.  His was just as bland.  The waitress then brought me a bowl of egg flower soup to try and it was the same way.  Even the summer rolls were a disapointment.  They didnt even come with peanut sauce but hoisin sauce instead and they tasted bland too.  I cant say enough about how kind the waitress though.  She was very understanding and apologetic.

If I could give them ZERO stars or Negative stars, I would!!!  I wouldn't send my worst enemy here!  This place is a joke!!!  I should have known not to come here after my husband was treated here a few years ago after a car accident, and was treated by morons.  But I did. I had surgery TWO days ago at Banner Gateway, where I was treated amazingly!!  Today, my calf started hurting really bad, and I was, and still am, afraid it could be a blood clot.  I returned to Banner Gateway, but after being triaged, I was told due to the flu epidemic, there would be a 3-4 hour wait, so my husband and I left to try somewhere else.  We ended up at this poor excuse for a hospital instead. The lady in the waiting room was very friendly and professional, but that's where it stopped.  I was taken back to a bed, and was told to get on it.  It was up really high, and I explained to guy that I just had surgery and I couldn't get up on it.  He just stared blankly at me, so I tried to get on, and almost fell, pulling on my incisions.  Then with a second attempt, I got on, but it was very painful to do so.  He then took my vitals, and walked about 15 feet away to put them into their system.  A female nurse walked over to him and asked what I was here for.  He told her that my leg hurt.  She said, "her leg hurts?" and rolled her eyes.  He told her that I had just had surgery two days ago, and she then said, "well then why the hell didn't she go back to where she had it done?"  Then a third nurse, named Megan, joined in on the banter while PICKING HER NOSE SEVERAL TIMES and wiping her runny nose with the back of her hand, AND COUGHING into her hand.  The she sat down at a desk, about 10 feet from me, and started putting syringes and needles together, and onto saline bags.  She not once washed her hands!!!  I was disgusted!  Then the other female nurse, (her name tag was backwards so I couldn't get her name) told them that I would be shipped off to another hospital, and told them that everyone is going to be diverted to other hospitals.  She spoke very loudly, so we could hear everything!  So at that point, I got out of bed, and my husband and I walked out.  Then Megan, the nose picker, came running after me to make sure I didn't leave before signing an AMA (against medical advice), but I refused to sign it because I was NEVER given any advice.  I laid in the bed for almost an hour listening to them talking about the show on tv that they were all watching, and the "cool" commercials.  I have worked at an urgent care in Mesa, for over 15 years now, and if any one of us ever treated a patient this way, we would be SERIOUSLY reprimanded and maybe even fired!!!

I work next door and I am addicted!!!  I have eaten there 4 times since they opened last week!  The falafel is the best I have ever had, as is the hummus, and the schwarma and the gyro and the babaganoosh!  They are so nice in there too, and very fast service.  The place is really pretty inside too.  They are very nice about accomodating my low carb diet, and will make special changes for me on the plates.  I am so glad they moved in next door!  I am bringing my husband for dinner this weekend. :-)

This little restaurant is owned and operated by a nice married couple.  My husband and I went in there tonight for the first time, and had a great experience.  The man and wife running it are very nice and super friendly.  The man took our order and his wife did the cooking. My husband had the ribeye and a salad and I had their Tuesday special, street tacos.  The ribeye was very good, grilled and seasoned nicely and was very flavorful.  The tacos were sooooo good!  You get 5 of them for $5 on Tuesdays, and they were delicious and came with homemade green salsa.  We will definitely go back.  I am excited to go after church on Sunday, to try one of their breakfast burritos.  The restaurant itself is very modest and small, and could use a makeover, but it was very clean and orderly.
