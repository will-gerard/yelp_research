I went to @coachnwillies last night, as part of the @downtownphoenix spring fling pub crawl. Coach & Willies is the reason negative ratings should be possible on @yelp.  I will never, ever return.  When we arrived, we ordered a beer, and a soda.  We also ordered nachos. They were piled high. This is a good thing.  Removing the first couple chips resulted in a couple olives falling on to the bar. I wiped them into a pile, but figured I'd wait until I was done, to catch anything else, and clean it up.  A few of us decided to have a shot, to celebrate a birthday-in-progress. I flagged one of the bartenders down.  He approaches me and says "Are you gonna stop making a mess on my bar?" Me: "Excuse me?" BT: "You're making a mess" Me: "I would like to order a drink, not get hassled" BT: "I don't care about your drinks, I only care about your tips" Me: "Well you're not exactly working for one at the moment" BT: "Are you going to order or not?"  I placed my order without any further comments, lest I inform him of my true feelings.  He takes my credit card and asks if I'd like to keep it open. I tell him no, because I have left my card in the past.  He returns with the receipt. On the "tip" line I write "NoFuckingWay!" I work in a service industry. You don't treat me like shit and still get a tip. Fuck you.  A while later I go to order a beer. This same motherfucker tells me I'm cut off.  Yes, I am cut off.  I have had maybe three beers, and a shot, in 5 hours.  I ask another bartender, and as he is about to pour me a beer, the first SOB hollers to him that I am cut off, then proceeds to show him my receipt.  Because, apparently, you not giving a tip is justification for him being a cocksucker.  I demand to see a manager, and one comes over. I tell him that the guy is cutting me off because I refused to tip him, and he tells me that the problem is that there is a $10 minimum on CC transactions.  Curiously, that isn't stated anywhere. Further, this "manager" took my first beer order, when I arrived, and made no mention of the minimum when I bought just the one beer, nor did the other bartender mention that when I paid for the shots, which actually totaled $24.  This "manager" was gracious enough to let me pay their establishment for service again. /sarcasm  I will recommend to every single person I know to never patronize that establishment, and I will never return to a place with such puerile and petty employees.

Let me start by saying that this struck me as a very white-washed mexican food restaurant. In other words, intended for the typical white American who is unfamiliar with quality mexican faire.  I appreciated the provision of chips and salsa, and the gentleman who brought them was VERY considerate and kind to have brought individual salsa cups for each of the five of us.  But it was like pulling teeth to get more.  I ordered the pork taquitos from the appetizer menu. $6.25 for six cigarette sized items that were undoubtedly frozen ten minutes prior.  The items that others at the table ordered appeared to be tasty, and one fellow patron literally cleared the plate.  If I were in the area with out of town guests who wanted mexican, and they were not well versed in the faire, I'd take them here.  Otherwise we'd go elsewhere.

I gave it a shot because it looked interesting from the street and had a nice patio.  I went, that's it, I'm done.  I ordered the Blue Plate Special, which today was a chicken green chili plate.  The chicken was quite dry, it came with wild rice (wtf?) and had tomato slices on a bed of leafy greens. W? T? F?  That screams out "filler".  There was pico de gallo which wasn't too bad. No idea if it was handmade or store bought, but it was the bright spot in my experience.  To drink I had a belgian wheat beer that was pretty good, but I ordered that one because the waiter said they didn't have Widmer Bros. Hefeweizen.  Despite there being a Widmer Bros. Hefeweizen neon sign hanging behind the bar.  The waitress, who, by the way, appeared to be old enough to have worked at Toms when it opened (80 years) was not good at all. Ten minutes from when I ordered my beer she came out empty handed to see if I was ready to order. When I asked about aforementioned beer she rolled her eyes and departed, returning with said beer, adorned with an orange slice, that I specifically requested it not have.  When my food was delivered, in a MOSTLY timely manner, she never returned.  Ever.  Despite my beer being empty.  I don't think I'll be going back to Toms, nor would I recommend it.

We were very rushed today. We waited a bit for a table, but once seated, had no service for quite a while.  Lena came and inquired of our drink order has been taken. We told her it hadn't, and she offered to take it, while explaining how slammed they'd been, and that she'd been scheduled to leave at 6, but was staying to help out.  She offered to take our food order, and get it put in right away. We received our food very quickly.  The efforts of this wonderful woman made our day considerably less stressful, and she should be highly commended.  P.S. I love the new decor

Went to @NYPD_Pizza for the first time tonight, because I had a coupon for a free entree.  Now, let me make it clear, I was an idiot, and I didn't print the coupon, because it clearly stated you could merely show it to your server from your phone.  So I did that. And because I did, I didn't read "the fine print", which clearly stated what exactly you were entitled to. The coupon: http://goo.gl/tuIS  So after we had placed our order, I looked at the coupon again, and noticed the listing of what was included in the entree selection. Feeling a case of caveat emptor, I searched out our server, and informed her of my mistake.  Her response was fantastic; she said what we had ordered already (shells florentine) would be probably be ok, but she would verify. She did indeed check, and they claimed that since neither I nor they caught until well after the order was placed (it was only about 5 or 10 mins...) they would go ahead and make the adjustment on my check.  That's customer service, beyond and above. I fully expected to have to change my order, or pay full price for the shells, and would not have felt that it were anyone's fault but my own.  The food was pretty tasty. Along with the shells, we ordered the Brooklyn Family Style pizza, which had pepperoni, sausage, and fresh basil.  The shells were pretty good, but nothing phenomenal.  The basil aroma that accompanied the arrival of the pie was wonderful! The sausage volume was a bit sparse, but the pizza was delicious, and I would recommend it.  It was a beautiful night, so we sat on the patio. The table that we were at had a slight ant problem, but once I cleared them, they didn't return.  Our server was a bit overwhelmed, but overall I think she did a decent job, and I made sure I showed my appreciation for her efforts.  I may back, but only if I were in the area.

Took my truck in today. Been pulling to the right for about forever. Or at least the last couple years.  Went here based on Yelp reviews. Glad I did.  Guy went out, put my truck on the rack. About 5 minutes later came in and said the tires were gonna make it wonky, since they weren't worn correctly.  I told him they were used tires, since I'm poor.  He said he could make it drive straight, based on the tires, or make it the way it's supposed to be, and the tires would make it pull anyway, until I get a good, matched set.  I told him to make it correct, and I'd get the tires when I could.  He goes back out, then about 10 minutes later comes back in and tell me the entire problem is tires. Says I might need a ball joint within a year, but everything else looks just fine.  Says "No charge. Keys are in it".  Thanks, Jack's, for the free inspection! I will come back when I need some work done!  P.S. locally-owned business, so please support them

Went to @VincentsOnCBack with the Chaparral High School Hospitality 2, and Culinary 2 classes, for an EATIQuette presentation about dining etiquette.  Fact: young people eating dinner with family has a greater impact on school performance than school attendance.  About the meal; Vegetable soup: very hearty, lots of veggies, squash, corn, carrots, potatoes, broth could have been richer.  Chicken was very moist and tender, potatoes au gratin had great flavor profile, but lacked caramelization, vegetables were crisp and delicious, béarnaise sauce was just the right amount, and tasted amazing.  French-style apple tart, with house-made vanilla ice cream, and vanilla and raspberry sauces.  Chef Vincent Guerithault came out to the dining room and addressed us, which was a wonderful experience.  And to top it all off, we all got gift cards!!  Many thanks to Chef Vincent, the servers, and the Rothschilds, for the wonderful experience today!  Note; TINY urinal stall! I could barely fit!

Tina was our server, she did a great job!  Came here for breakfast, on the recommendation of a great friend.  Had the #2 breakfast special, 2 eggs, hash browns, and a biscuit with gravy.  The biscuit and gravy were tasty, though likely premade gravy, and frozen biscuit. Not a complaint, just an observation.  The price of three meals was extremely reasonable.  I would recommend this place for breakfast.  I also hope to check the place out in the evening.

This place is definitely showing its age. It has withstood time in that it is still in operation, but it is in dire need of some serious renovation.  The "warm room", which is the snack bar, is often a disaster area. There is some sort of "camp" for kids, which apparently meets up in the warm room. Then destroys it. Then leaves it like that. I paid $2.50 for a "deluxe mocha", which was instant coffee, and powdered cocoa. How that constitutes "deluxe" I'll probably never know. There is no comfortable seating to be found anywhere. The skates were considerably aged. Ostensibly in an attempt to clear the condensation on the viewing glass (but failing miserably) there was a large fan blowing the cold air down toward the seating, just to ensure you weren't able to be warm at all. (Not a major problem the day I went, as it was approaching supernova temps outside) There was actually a diaper on the floor in the "warm room", that remained there for the entire duration I was at the rink, which was almost 3 hours.  I would sooner pay the cost to go to the Ice Den. It is far cleaner, much more maintained, has comfortable seating, much more, and much better amenities.

I love this library for two very important reasons; free WiFi, Air Conditioning.  I take my daughters to this location frequently, as there are plenty of in-house kids activities, plus we can check out movies and books for them, that I can still return when they're back home in CA.  But the summers, when the girls are here for an extended stay, this is our home away from home.  We will often ride our bikes down, and just hang out in the air conditioned comfort, playing games, or reading books. Sometimes the girls will do some computer-based activities, and I'll catch up on Facebook or Twitter, on my iPhone.  One of the things I love about Phoenix area libraries is the Culture Pass; you "check out" a culture pass and get free tickets and admission to area museums, including the Heard, the Bead museum, etc.  There is plenty of parking, and several bike racks available.  Go and check it out!

I've been going to Carlos O'Brien's since I was a child. It's one of the finest mexican food establishments in the valley!  I admit that I am in a perpetual rut with regards to their dishes; I never eat anything but chimichangas!  However, my mother always has the pollo fundido, which I've also tried; it's AMAZING!  I love their salsa as well.  I've been going for 20 years, I'm not stopping any time soon!

Sierra was my bartender, and later, Jessica, both gracious, and attentive.  Had the Gustido pequeño nachos, and a few Pacific Clara draughts.  Enjoyed a NASCAR race, and some good conversation.  Love this establishment, and will be back again, and again.

Had breakfast here this morning.  Two words; CHOCOLATE! FOUNTAIN!  Had the breakfast quesadilla, with chorizo. It was amazing!  And I don't know what brand of coffee they're serving, but it was really delicious.  I've never had a bad experience with this establishment, and would gladly visit daily.

I was a bit hesitant to return. My last visit left me feeling a bit cold. (A new-ish girl working the outside bar was giving a LOT of her attention to a particular patron, and drinks, food, etc. was slow coming)  Marvin was our server tonight. He's got LOTS of energy.  Had a carnitas chimichanga. Delicious, as always!  Love the flour chips, and the hot salsa.  I will be back.

Love it! Been living near this place for most of the last thirty years, and finally came tonight.  They had salad, with ranch, or Italian (go figure), or vinegar and oil.  The pasta choices were; spaghetti, with meatballs, and red sauce; pasta Primavera; bow tie pasta, with sausage, and Alfredo sauce  The meatballs were good portions, , and the red sauce was delicious.  The Primavera was good, but it's not really my gig.  The bow tie, with Alfredo, was delicious!  The bread was soft, with a nice crust.  Glad I finally came, after seeing it for thirty years.  Gonna have to come again.

Love the @StreetsofNY lunch specials!  Two slices of cheese pizza, plus drink; or one slice, and a salad (caesar or garden), plus drink, for $5.  Went with my girlfriend, and loved the atmosphere at this location.  Their pizza is some of the best to be had, and though our waitress was ostensibly unable to distinguish between ranch, and bleu cheese, it was a pleasant experience.  I will definitely return to this location, as it's very close to home. :)

This business makes me wish I could give negative stars.  Here's the deal; at the COB on 10-29, I had $12.52 in my account. For no discernible reason, they deducted an NSF fee from my account. Despite still being in the black.  The morning of 10-30, the Denny's transaction from the prior day, for $11, clears my account. And I get ANOTHER NSF FEE.  Because my account is overdrawn.  Because of the NSF fee from the previous night.  When I call the bank, they explain that the Denny's transaction had already put a "Hold" on my account, and that there was another transaction still pending, which, when combined with the Denny's transaction, but me in the red. And that, since I was already in the red, from the hold, and the pending, when the Denny's transaction actually cleared my account, because I had overdraft "protection"(1), they paid it, but I was already overdrawn, so they had to charge me an NSF fee.  I was on the verge of my head exploding.  I have withdrawn almost every dime from this institution (still have transactions pending) and will never work with them again.  Fuck this place. They will literally rob you.

From the moment I called, I knew I found a place that cared.  The gentleman was very straightforward on the phone. No suggestions that there might be an extra charge for anything, no mention of any "value adds", nothing of the sort that I've experienced at countless other facilities.  I asked him how much, he asked what year, make and model, I told him, he gave me a price.  I asked if they could get me done that day, he said yes.  Less than an hour later, I was there and home already.  Very nice.  I will be back for future lube and oil work.

They're not exactly a model of kind or friendly customer service.  They rejected me for a checking account. That isn't a problem, it's how they treated me after I was told; like "It's time for you to go".  A modicum of decency would have been nice, not getting shuffled out the door.

Oh @SouperSalad, for nearly $10, you can include a drink in the meal.  I enjoy the food, and the selection. I will probably return from time to time, because it's close, and it's a decent price for the kids, who can have water.  But really, I don't think the soda should be an additional cost.

I tried.  I really tried so very hard to like you.  I am thoroughly disgusted with that green car company bullshit, so I decided I was going to give you my business.  I'm done. You are every bit as bad a business, perhaps even worse.  The number of times I've tried to get a cab, only to have the taxi show up, TAKE SOMEONE ELSE, then try to get another cab in a timely manner, TYPICALLY ONLY TO CALL BACK AND FIND OUT A REPLACEMENT CAB WAS NEVER SENT, is more than 5, and at least 5 more than it should be.  Your dispatchers are deplorably rude, uninformed, disinterested, and generally lacking any decorum, or modicum of customer service.  Your drivers are largely friendly, but equally bad at customer service, and wholly lacking any knowledge of the area.  Tonight was the end; I was at a well known eatery, THE NAME OF WHICH WAS TRANSMITTED TO THE DRIVER, PER THEIR OWN STATEMENTS, when I used the app to hail a cab.  After an unreasonably long delay I receive a call from the driver, claiming to be "out front". I attempted to inquire if he was in the parking lot, or on the street, but he'd already ended the call.  I walk out to the parking lot, no cab. There is a side entrance, right off the street, so I go around the building to that entrance, no cab.  I call him back and ask his location. He says he is "out front", to which I respond that the entrance is on the south side of the building.  He says he only sees little houses.  What?  I ask again where he is, and simultaneously walk back around the building to the street entrance, and again ask where he is.  He asks which apartment I'm in.  What the fuck?!  I ask him, was the name of the establishment transmitted with the dispatch?  Yes.  DO YOU SEE A RESTAURANT WHERE YOU ARE AT?!  No.  I tell him to honk his horn, and I hear it, so I walk INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET, and see him a couple blocks north of me.  I tell him to come south, he is quite OBVIOUSLY not AT A RESTAURANT.  He tells me he was "just following the GPS".  Additionally, I have twice tried to take advantage of the $15/airport deal, only to twice be told "Oh that's not the right price they just haven't updated the website". It says that price tonight, March 17, on the newly updated website.  I could go on, but it's pointless.  I'm a truck driver. I travel to many destinations I am not familiar with. But I DAMN sure know how to locate A BUSINESS NAME!!!  The ignorance of the drivers, combined with the utter indifference of the dispatchers, is too much.  Fuck this company.  If you need a cab, I recommend Apache. Cash only, but better than any green, or yellow options.

This place is fantastic if you have children, and great even if you don't.  I remember going there as a child myself, riding the rails, enjoying the play areas.  There is a carousel, a couple snack bars, model railroads to view, several miniature trains to ride, plenty of picnic tables and benches, and a huge expanse of grass on which to run and play.  Great park!

Courtesy of @Shwaag, I dined at Fleming's with @CaymusCabernet, @RussellOnSteak and @MarianOnWine.  I should have written this sooner, but this is my 100th review, and I wanted to reserve that spot for this.  I attended an Interactive Wine Dinner, which was an amazing event, and I highly recommend attending one.  Our evening began with an amuse of Danish Bleu Cheese and Red Onion on Flatbread. The caramelized onion contrasted with the bleu cheese was phenomenal! I think I ate about 7 of them!  This was paired with Caymus' 2008 Conundrum; a blend of Napa and central coast varietals. This was my first experience with a blended white, and I am a fan! Vanilla, melon, pear, mild acidity, really amazing.  The combination of the sweet onions, and the vanilla and citrus of the Conundrum, made for a fantastic finish. Yumm!   Out next course was an heirloom tomato salad with burrata cheese  (mozzarella), arugula, and diced beets. I'm not a fan of tomatoes by themselves, but these were delicious, hearty, and very fresh. And the spice of the arugula paired with the acid of the tomato, and the creaminess of the burrata, made for a delectable salad. I finished it off, even the beets.  This was paired with the 2007 Mer Soleil Silver Unoaked Chardonnay. Very fruity, creamy, beautiful golden wine.  Paired with the acid of the tomatoes, and the creaminess of the burrata highlights the richness of the wine wonderfully.   For the main course we were served peppercorn-crusted New York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce, Sauteed Escarole and Fingerling Potatoes. The strip was what other cuts of beef aspire to be. The preparation is what other chefs aspire to accomplish. Simplistic, subtle, yet very powerful in both mouth feel, and flavor. The escarole was topped with shaved hard-boiled egg, which was unique, and definitely changed the impact of the escarole. (I'm not particularly fond of it myself) The fingerling potatoes were perfect. The bordelaise could have been delivered in a cup and I'd have happily drank it up.  Paired with this course were two Cabernet Sauvignons; a 2000, and a 2008.  The 2008 had far too many tannins for my liking. I don't want to pucker up like I've just eaten sand and have dry mouth. The 2000 was much more mild, and was rather delicious.  Both paired wonderfully with the grilled meat, and the saltiness of the herbs on the potatoes meshed well with the reds.   For dessert we were served Berry Trifle with sour cream pundcake and amaretto mascarpone Cream. OMG. I died and went to heaven. Which I don't believe in. But almost could have.  Topped with toasted almond slivers, this dessert was pure bliss. The berries floating in the rich mascarpone, resting atop that delicious yet sinfully good pound cake.  As if that wasn't enough to knock your socks off, they paired it with a 2004 Mer Soleil Late Viognier that alone could make you think you were drinking pure sugar, with great flavor. Apricot, honey, orange, balanced acid make for a lush and long finish.  An amazing dinner and dessert, but in addition to the fantastic food, we were connected via videoconference with Chef Russell Skall; Fleming's Executive Chef, Chuck Wagner; owner of Caymus Vineyards, and Marian Jansen op de Haar; Fleming's Director of Wine. They fielded questions from several locations that were all conferenced in, making it feel a bit more personal. :)  As if all that weren't enough, one of the servers mistakenly switched my tab with another party's. That didn't really bother me, as I understand that mistakes can happen.  How it was handled made me want to reserve my 100th review for them; Mike Head, one of the Operating Partner's for the Fleming's in the Scottsdale Hilton, had introduced himself during the event, and had provided me his business card. I was expecting a deposit the night of the event, so the next morning I checked my account, which was how I noticed the disparity between my tab, and the amount my account was debited. (It was a triple digit charge) I emailed Mike, explaining the situation, and requested he contact me. Later in the day I hadn't heard from him, so I called him.  Long story less long; he was going to contact my bank and, calling as a merchant, attempt to reverse the charge. He called me back to inform me that, rather than take a chance on there being any delay in me getting my funds back, he just went ahead and took cash to my bank, and deposited it in my account.  Nobody does that. Ever.  Mike Head of Fleming's did.  He even returned my gratuity for the mistake having been made in the first place.  And after all that, they still gave me a gift card to entice me to return. Mike Head, and Fleming's of Scottsdale, epitomize what customer service should alway be about.  Thank you Fleming's, Caymus Vineyards, Chef Skall, Mike Head, and most importantly, Shwaag, for such an amazing evening.  And thanks especially to my date, for being so beautiful. :)  If you haven't been to Fleming's, do so at your earliest opportunity.

Wish I could give negative stars.  Called ahead to verify they were open for business, was told that "everything was warming up", but yes, they were open.  Arrived at 9:36, left at 10:01.  My g/f waited at least five minutes to be seated, while I went to use the restroom.  Also, your waitress took my g/f's order and brought drinks, but never came back to the table after I came out of the restroom. And my g/f said the waitress wasn't even in her uniform yet, and changed after she took the order.  Never received the appetizer, never had my order taken.  Seriously, get some softer fucking toilet paper and paper towels. That's a really chickenshit way to make more profit.

Very bright and open feel in the dining room.  Nicole was my server.  Chorizo breakfast burrito; good size, plenty of meat and potatoes  I asked for only bananas and strawberries, rather than the normal fruit cup, however, the fruit should be mixed a bit before serving.  Prices are kinda steep ($9.25 for the burrito) so I won't likely go back soon, or often.  Good experience.

Had the lunch Pollo con queso special. The chicken was pretty dry, and had no discernible flavor.  The jalapeño cheese they topped it with wasn't very spicy, but was ok.  Our server was good, and they have decent salsa with their chips.  My second trip, mostly because it's close to work, and my coworker doesn't like Manuel's.  I may be back.

Had @CousinsSubs for lunch Tuesday.  The person at the counter was very nice, and gave me the combo price for a bag of chips, even though I didn't buy them at the same time.  That being said, the 2-for-$5 sandwiches were not anything remotely approaching "a good value".  The floor had visible mop streaks, likely from already-filthy water, the tables were sticky, there was a large collection of baskets on top of the trash can.  I would not return here unless there was nothing else available.

Used my @BoldBajaFresh @Groupon for lunch today.  I've always been a fan a Baja Fresh, and ate there quite often in CA.  The distance to the closest one here in AZ is excessive for regular visits.  I don't really know that they are worth reviewing, per se, but I wanted to relate my experience today at this particular location.  The chips we were given seemed stale to both my g/f and I. The manager took my old chips, and grabbed a new bag to hand me. Rather than proceed with that action, he also discarded them, and informed me he would make up a new batch, and deliver a double order to our table.  They came out hot and fresh, and delicious!  It was a nice display of customer service, an increasingly rare trait these days.  Thanks!

Another place I'd like to give a negative star review.  For starters, the lanes have entirely too much oil. I mean like, my ball towel was saturated before the night was over, and I didn't even play 3 entire games.  We were there sure a fundraiser, and entry was to include a pizza, and a pitcher of soda.  Realizing most of the other bowlers had already received, and consumed their pies, I inquired as to the location of ours, only to be informed that it had already been brought. Funny, nobody told me, or my hungry children.  The manager seemed quite displeased to be asked to provide us the pizza we were owed, and finally, begrudgingly, brought three measly slices. I asked if that was all we got, and he said "All the pizza have been brought out"  Dude, we DIDN'T GET OURS!  Whatever, they were just barely doing what they had to.  I would never voluntarily return there on my own, but I would probably go back if I was invited there.  For the record, I prefer Brunswick lanes over AMF, and I prefer small establishments, rather than large corporate ventures.

Took my daughter to @DennysAllnightr for her Birthday Grand Slam.  Nobody came to the table for almost 20 mins.  Our server was Penny.  No coffee refills in the first 40 mins.  Time from placing order till delivered was close to 25 mins.  Food was same quality as always at Denny's, which is fine.  But the service was severely lacking.  I'm disappointed, even for Denny's.

I can't even tell you how much I love @BillJohnsonsAZ!  I have been going there since I was knee-high to a grasshopper, and they have never disappointed me.  Pulled pork, beef brisket, and hot links, is the perfect combination, to get a taste of everything that is wonderful about Big Apple.  The atmosphere alone would keep me coming back, time and again; sawdust on the floor, western decor (including miniature covered wagon lamps), and the waiters and waitresses are all packing heat, in the form of a .44 on their hips.  Used to be they could draw the guns, but now they're bolted to the holster. Sad reflection on the regression our society has gone through, that a prop must be secured "for the public safety".  They have a delicious apple pie dessert, that is properly served with american cheese. I personally prefer it with a scoop of vanilla.  And don't think they're only about lunch or dinner; they have a great breakfast menu. They also have M-F 6-11 AM specials, including a homemade cinnamon roll.  I have been to Big Apple more times than I can count, and I will return again.  And again.

The waitress couldn't tell me which Shock Top they had on tap, and didn't know that a mudslide isn't always a frozen drink.  And thanks place only takes cash.  Fuck this place.

Have been wanting to go here for a few years.  Today I went, and very much enjoyed the experience.  I had the Catalan omelette: Schreiner's chorizo, kalamata olives, provolone, tomatoes, onions. It was quite delicious!  I also had the Mexican chocolate latte, which was soooo good!  It being in Scottsdale, I'm not likely to go often, but I'd return.

I was seated at the bar. A very nice young man was working the bar an provided good conversation.  I was offered a DELICIOUS chicken, bacon, bleu cheese amuse. Yum!  I ordered a pine nut pesto pizza, which wad delivered by the chef! :)  The crust was perfect! Thick enough for structure and substance, but thin enough to "hide" behind the flavors of tomato and pine nut pesto. The cheese was also just right.  Delicious!  I also had the chicken panini, which was fantastic! The bread was a bit hard, but I think I was too busy talking and let it sit too long.  All in all I'd definitely recommend L'Academie if you're in that area of Scottsdale.

I had a chorizo and egg burrito, my friend had a carne asada burrito, and I had a medium drink, and it was all less than $10.  That alone makes me like this place.  The fact that the burrito was pretty good sized, and extremely tasty, makes me love this place!  It's not in my neck of the woods, but I may be training in the area for another week. If so, I intend to stop in and try the nachos.

If I had to describe how a resort hotel should be, I would describe the Hospitality Suite Resort.  The room was huge, and perfect for our little family staycation.  The kitchen, while unused by us, was large enough to be able to cook and dine in the room, providing a four-burner stove, with oven, and an apartment sized refrigerator.  There was a bar in the room, with stools, perfect for making the kids feel grown up.  The bedroom was good sized, with a HUGE walk-in closet!  The pool bar has a free happy hour nightly, from 5 PM to 6:30 PM. We did not take advantage of it, but that's a really great way to keep the clientele happy.  The rooms come with complimentary hot breakfast, served at the adjacent J.J.'s Cantina restaurant. The choices for the hot breakfast were plentiful, including french toast, eggs and bacon/sausage, etc. A great value-add, which more resort type hotels need to invest in.  Being there for the two days, I saw much more interaction between guests than I have seen in quite a while. While not everyone seeks that type of interaction, it's nice to see the environment not only allow for it, but encourage it, as I believe Hospitality Suite Resort does.  The counter staff were always friendly, helpful, smiling people, who perfectly represent the establishment.  The location is central to much of what there is to see and do in and around Scottsdale.  They offer free WiFi throughout the establishment, which is another value-add that not enough hotels, or even resorts, provide.  If I had visitors coming in from out of town, and staying more than one night, I would HIGHLY recommend Hospitality Suite Resort.  I will definitely be keeping them in mind for my next staycation, as well. :)

The patsitsio was amazing!  Roasted red potatoes and rice pilaf with a pasta dish may be starch overkill, but to it's all good!  The hummus was delicious, with a nice bite to it.  I love sitting on the patio and people-watching the folks on Mill Ave. stroll by.  Don't get down to Mill a lot, but when I do, I try to get some Opa!

The one thing @Starbucks excels at is providing a comfortable environment to just "hang out".  Free WiFi, usually ample power outlets, air conditioned, comfy seating, and all the free water you can drink.  For these reasons I still go.  And I am grateful.

Our Server was Steve, and he was excellent.  The bread basket was fantastic, the rosemary bread, and the creamy butter were amazing.  Ordered the guacamole; very creamy, great flavor, enjoyed that very much.  The entree came with salad and a soup. The soup was chicken tortilla soup. Really excellent handmade soup, with lots of chicken, lots of veggies. Delicious!  For my entree I had the prime rib; it was the perfect temperature, and served with creamy horseradish, and a delicious au jus.  I have been to Monti's previously, but it had been a while. I was happy to recall what I'd been missing.

Went to Cerreta's with my two daughters. They can't appreciate the humor in the machine that is a duplicate of the one in the famous I Love Lucy episode, but they sure do appreciate the white chocolate with red drizzle covered pretzles the machine was pumping out.  I love taking this short but interesting tour through the factory. Where else are you gonna see ten-pound bars of chocolate? Or a 7 foot high chocolate heart? Or a 300-lb chocolate football?  The factory does open house tours regularly, but I usually only end up in Glendale for Glendale Glitters or Chocolate Affaire.  If you find yourself in Glendale, stop by. Lots of fun!

I took my daughters here for halloween activities, and to find a pumpkin.  The place is really neat, and a great destination for families with children.  There is a corn pit (think ball pit, but with kernels of dried corn instead), a tomato gun (compressed air, shoots about 200 yards), snack bar area with some good choices, various things to climb on, some children's craft activities.  Shorter drive than Schnepf Farms, albeit less to do.  I look forward to returning for halloween this year.

The regular location for #techlunchnorth, I was there again today.  I have been a fan of Chino Bandido for many years, and was pleased to be able to return, after moving back to AZ.  Today I ordered the jerk chicken, and carnitas.  The jerk chicken is always one of my choices; it's moist and tender, and the seasonings have enough of a kick to make it "jerk", but not enough for you to want to call the cook that.  The carnitas seemed a bit dry today. I've had it in the past, but today something seemed off.  Chicken-fried rice, and black beans, to round out the meal.  And the cookie is always a delicious treat after the meal.  Easy and fast, and good flavor. A perfect combination.

I enjoy Rosie's for the food and atmosphere, but really I like it here because many of my friends are here often.  I have not had any of their entrees, but their appetizers are pretty tasty. I prefer the pretzel with cheese and mustard. The mustard is face-puckering good.  The place starts getting pretty loud toward the end of happy hour, so conversation at that time is tenuous.  They have a nice patio area, both downstairs and upstairs.  The staff are usually pretty attentive, but there are exceptions.  They have free wifi, and many of the booths on the east side of the restaurant have outlets, so it's a nice coworking environment, during the day time hours.  I will return.

Carly's is in a very unassuming little building in the downtown area of Phoenix. There are two doors, but only one works. For people like me, that can be a bit of an embarrassment.  The bartender was quick to come and offer me a drink. They have quite a wide range of beers and ales to choose from. I chose a Guiness because, well, it's Guiness.  After some conversation I decided it was time to eat.  I ordered the cuban.  Two words; GREAT Cuban!  Seriously, that was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  Evar!  The cost was quite reasonable, great food, great beer selection, they have private parking, and it's downtown. What more can you ask?

Went to Half Moon for an @SMCPhoenix after party.  The room we were put in was nice and large, and basically private.  Our waitress, Claire, was very attentive and personable.  Good selection of beers available. I opted for the Blue Moon, because I am partial to hefeweizens. It didn't disappoint.  I wasn't extremely hungry, so I looked to their appetizer choices. I ordered the garlic breadsticks.  Wow. They were FUCKING AMAZING!!!!!!  The garlic had a particular sweetness, and the cheese was slightly gooey, but not like napalm on your tongue.  The sauce was pretty good too, but I was so focused on the breadsticks, I couldn't say for sure.  They easily made a meal. I was full, and happy.  The location of this establishment dictates I won't be back often, but I will back.

#WVFN rolled in to Haus Murphy's last night.  For starters, they have proper 32oz glasses, so they're already a hit in my book.  Started the eating part of the night with a couple giant pretzels.  Giant is correct; the thing was as big as my head! And big, puffy, salty, and delicious! With the brown mustard, it was definitely a hit!  We ordered the Bauernplatte, which is listed as a combo for two, but handily accommodated three of us.  The schnitzel was delicious, the german fried potatoes were delicious, bratwurst was ok.  I avoided the red cabbage because I'm not a fan, but the other diners stated it was fantastic.  Beer: Weihenstephan Hefeweizen was everything a wheat beer should be; rich and full-bodied, but not too heavy, with a very light citrus attribute.  Franziskaner Weissbier was phenomenal! Delicious, rich, perfect.  Franziskaner Dunkel was superb.  Can't wait to sample the remainder of their selections.  The live music was really awesome.  They have a nice patio, with misters, so even in the summer it should be pleasant.  I would never have guessed a place like this existed in Glendale. Now that I'm aware of its existence, I will certainly try to return.

Used my @CorbinsBarGrill @GrouponPhoenix today.  Jasmine was our server, and was also tending bar. She was quite distracted. I don't think it was entirely her fault, but the service was less than what I would have expected.  Mom had a cheese crisp with grilled chicken and ancho chiles.  The girls and I had clam chowder, and pesto cheese bread.  LOTS of potatoes in the chowder, a decent amount of cheese on the bread.  Country music on the radio was ideal for me.  I like Corbin's, and I'll be back again.

Appetizers: Dolmades Beef, pork, rice stuffed grape leaves HUGE, delicious!  Tiropites Flaky phyllo dough baked with parmesan and feta cheese inside Amazing!  Saganaki Flambeau Kefalograviera (sheep's milk cheese) baked with olive oil, brought to the table in a flaming dish, drizzled with fresh squeezed lemon juice. Laid atop their thick sliced garlic bread, this is outstanding!  Spanakopites Flaky phyllo dough baked with spinach and feta cheese inside This classic Greek treat is a must have, and theirs was great!  Main courses: Pasteetso Lasagna, Greek style; Pastisio noodles with beef, tomatoes, and onions, and a cream sauce with cinnamon The potato topping was beautifully creamy!  Mousaka (a personal favorite dish) Similar to Pasteetso, but with eggplant instead of noodles Same amazing topping!  Capama Lamb stew served over rice Not my dish, but the bite I tasted was delightful  Baklava Cheesecake Oh. My. God. One of the most delicious slices of cheesecake I've ever enjoyed, served with a piece of Baklava on top, and garnished with ridiculously good hand made whipped cream, sprinkled with cinnamon The Baklava, also hand made, was also just incredible  As great as the food is, the atmosphere created by the restaurateur makes the experience so much better  Definitely must return!

One of the loveliest and quaint little bars I have ever been to in my life!  It's in what was once a residential home on a residential street. This, to me, adds considerably to its appeal!  They have an appreciable selection of beers and ales in the bottle. I don't drink wine so I can't comment, but there were people drinking some.  The lighting was perfect. The atmosphere was VERY pleasant! The pricing was good.  Definitely need to go back!

My first meal at @PHXPublicMarket.  The evening air was beautiful, so I opted for a patio spot. A bit on the loud side for phone conversations, but not excessive for socializing.  Ordered the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie, did not regret it one bit.  PERFECT crust! Thick top layer, thin sides, great color, nice, crisp edges.  The Chile was amazing! Good colors, great flavor profile, excellent heat, big chunks of pork.  The portion size was just about perfect, though I could have easily consumed another.  I waited far too long to dine at the market. My experience was fantastic!

I joined @rscottjones for lunch at @JasonsDeli.  I had the quarter-muff DEAL. (Quarter muffaletta, and I opted for the seafood gumbo)  If what I had constitutes a quarter of a full sandwich, I could feed my family on one muffaletta; it was HUGE! Definitely enough to satisfy me, and an especially great combination with the gumbo.  The gentleman at the counter warned me that the gumbo was very spicy. While there was a bit of a bite, it was certainly not as much as he led me to believe, which was actually a little bit of a disappointment. (I love it hot!)  A delicious, and pretty quick, lunch.  Bonus; free softserve ice cream!  I'll be back, as it's close to work.

Amazing amount of food. Meals come with either fries or a greek salad.  I went with the original gyro, and a salad.  The salad was delicious, with just enough dressing.  The gyro was fantastic, with fresh tomatoes and tzatziki.  Prices are above fast good, but the quality is definitely there, and it's nice to support local businesses.

I've been to Freddy's a dozen times, at least. My mother introduced me and my daughters to it a couple years back.  I invariably get the patty melt and love it.  Their fries are almost matchsticks, and quite tasty!  The concretes are fantastic!  Prices are reasonable for the food you get.

My first visit to @StFrancisPHX was part of the @FoodiesLikeUs Light Rail Dine Around (#PHXLRDA).  There was about 20 or so in our group, including wheelchair-bound attendees.  My initial impression wasn't a great one, as I got the impression that finding seating for us all, together, was more a chore for them, than doing business. It was later explained to me that our group inadvertently caused the problem.  Once we were seated, they brought out some bread, and oil. The bread was tasty, but there was maybe 8 oz of oil, for 20+ people.  On the recommendation of some people I trust, I ordered the Chile Verde.  It did not disappoint! Served in a mini iron skillet, with a nice chile right on top, and a couple wedges of corn bread, the meal was fantastic.  The chile had a very noticeable "bulkiness" to it, that I look for in good chile. Plenty of meat, and plenty of burn, without trying to permanently destroy taste buds.  The corn bread was a tad dry, which made it a bit too crumbly and fragile for really getting into dipping, but it was delicious, and soaked up the flavor quite nicely.  As this was our second stop, and I (stupidly) had over-indulged at our first location, AND we still had dessert to obtain, I was unable to finish my meal. But St. Francis has great little togo containers, so I now have lunch for tomorrow!  As a chef, I appreciated, and enjoyed, the open style kitchen. It's always a pleasure to observe people when they cook, but considerably more so when I know the food could be/is my own dish.  Overall, I had a good experience. I would certainly love to return, and fully intend on doing so, especially when the weather cools a bit, so I can enjoy the patio. I would also love to have the window seat upstairs.

Visited @HanaSushi for the first time, today.  Ordered a spicy tuna roll, a Yellowtail roll, a Vegas roll, and the Volcano roll.  The spicy tuna was delicious, and had a great presentation. The Yellowtail roll was good, but underwhelming. The Vegas roll was amazing! The crispy edge made for a unique experience in sushi. The Volcano roll was out of this world fantastic! The top layer of white fish, with the spicy sauce, and the added characteristic of it being baked, made for what is my new favorite dish.  I will definitely be returning.

Got 2 free kids admission coupons, so I paid for myself, and my daughters and I took the tour.  It was really neat to learn about that part of Phoenix's past, and I absolutely love historic architecture!  The players, in period costume, made the tour that much more entertaining.  I love the layout of the house, as well.  The after tour, which included much of Heritage Square, and a side exhibit of vintage undergarments, was quite interesting.  This isn't really something I would likely do again for myself, but I would consider taking out of town guests on the tour.

I took my children and my mother to Pioneer. I love giving my children history, especially local history.  Boy is there plenty of it here!  To quote another Yelper's review; "Screw Rawhide- come see the real deal!" http://www.yelp.com/biz/pioneer-living-history-village-phoenix#hrid:Ww3p283AMifbSn4sj-E-YA  The museum covers what was once an actual village or town prior to and just after the turn of the 20th century, Pioneer Arizona.  Many of the buildings are original structures from the town, while others are recreations or were brought in from other areas of Arizona.  The museum covers a large expanse of land and there is quite a bit of walking involved if you want to see everything.  But it's WORTH IT!  We spent about 5 or 6 hours there, finishing off our day at the adjacent restaurant, enjoying an ice cold Sioux City Sarsaparilla! (well, I enjoyed, my daughters turned up their noses)  We broke up the day with a nice picnic at the available tables.  There is a live blacksmith shop on-site who makes nails while you watch. There is an event area where they perform, but it was being worked on the day we visited, so no gunfights.  The close proximity to downtown Phoenix makes it an ideal destination for tourists and locals alike. MUCH closer, and MUCH more enjoyable than I imagine Rawhide is. (now, anyway. I haven't been to Rawhide since they moved)  A MUST SEE!

I went to @SwitchWineBar for the @Dine4AZ #Dine4AZTweetUp. I previously went as part of the Light Rail Pub Crawl, and was not very impressed.  I am now a fan. $3 Italian Drunken Sodas, $3 Caipirinhas, and a great spread of food.  They had a turkey sandwich, with fresh, handmade strawberry jam, that was so delicious, and reminded me of a Monte Cristo, but not fried. I could eat one of these every day!  The location is very convenient for light rail, and is close enough to downtown.  The beer selection was "ok, the drunken italian soda was really nice, and sneaks up on you, but the Caipirinhas were simply fantastic.  I'm thinking I may have to try their brunch, before I make a solid determination about our future together.  But I really enjoyed the TweetUp, and my impression of Switch moved up quite a bit.

I was surprised when I walked in; I had the impression from the exterior that the place was much smaller, and I expected only a counter, and perhaps a few tables. Pleasant surprise to be seated, with a waitress to attend.  The menu alone made my mouth water, just envisioning all the dishes.  I chose the Del Rey Torta, simply for the meat content, which is considerable, and it has egg. You can't go wrong with egg on a meat sandwich.  When the sandwich arrived, I thought perhaps my meal, and my mother's, were on the same plate; it was huge! It could easily feed a small family. Or a large chef. :)  One thing that was odd; potato chips with my torta. I suppose it was ignorant of me to think that a mexican food place would have tortilla chips, but that's what I've been conditioned to expect. Upon reflection, potato chips are a more fitting accompaniment to a sandwich, contents of said sandwich notwithstanding.  The salsa that was served with the meal was phenomenal. Not too spicy, but a nice bite, with a slightly smoky flavor. Delicious!  The sandwich was, as the menu implies, a meat paradise, with egg. I can't recall for certain, but I believe there were 5 kinds of meat, including chorizo. You can't ever go wrong with chorizo.  The prices are very reasonable, even ridiculously low, given the volume of food.  The torta turned out to be much more than I could finish in one sitting, but I think I may have been intimidated. I will have to challenge the menu again, at a later date.  I would recommend Los Reyes to anyone seeking something non-traditional, in the Sunnyslope area. Its location on 7th street makes it equally favorably for those traveling from downtown, even on public transportation.  I will definitely be returning.

I have heard about Pete's and had always wanted to try it.  I happened to be waiting across the street for a bus, so I decided today was the day.  I should have caught the bus.  It wasn't BAD food, but it was a long way from what I'd imagined.  The fish isn't even something unique; it's frozen patties, deep fried and served. The chips (french fries) are also frozen. Blech!  They provide some ketchup-based sauce (ostensibly) for dipping. I asked for tartar sauce and was told it was $0.35 for 2 oz or $0.70 for 4 oz. (What a bargain)  I declined.  The fish and fries were not the worst thing I've ever eaten, but for $5 bucks I would like more than frozen fish patties and frozen fries thrown into hot fat and chunked on a plate.  I won't be paying Pete a return visit anytime in the near future.  As an aside; this particular location (I can't speak for other locations) has outdoor seating. Only. Today was a nice day and sitting outside was nice.  But there are no restrooms available.  Save your money for better quality food elsewhere.

Yes, I'm reviewing @ChickfilA, but with good reason.  Marissa worked the counter today, and epitomized service with a smile!  She delivered our food to the table, and even asked if we needed refills on our drinks.  She was one of the friendliest people I've ever encountered at a fast food restaurant, and should be praised by her employer.  The food is pretty good, and I would probably go to Chik fil-A before KFC.  But I just want to rave about the service.

Had breakfast here the other day. There aren't many places left where you can get a two egg breakfast, with potatoes, and a bagel, for $5.99.  The latke was delicious, and very well done!  The cheddar/jalapeño bagel was really delicious!  The other thing that I love is that you get plenty of cream cheese to go with your bagel.  This wasn't my first visit, and won't be my last.

I dropped in to @SweetRepublic, finally, because they tweeted about their Chocolate Guinness, and a limited edition Jameson Irish Cream.  I have had their ice cream in the past, both from the truck, and at other events, and was already a fan.  Now, I'm fanatical.  The Jameson was amazingly good! I couldn't believe how well the flavor was represented, without having the harshness of the alcohol bite.  But the Chocolate Guinness won the day. It was so good, I ordered a pint to take home. (Unexplainably, it is still in the freezer. I will remedy that today!)  The location is right by my work, so I anticipate returning, again and again.  Jan and Helen are wonderful girls, and they have created something truly amazing. I congratulate them, and look forward to more of their creations.  And their commitment to using local ingredients makes me happy to spend my money there, rather than a chain, who doesn't concern themselves with the area.

Went to @districtkitchen today, after doing the National Day of Action Against SB1070 Phoenix March.  Having previously been an employee of the hotel, I was looking forward to being a patron of the restaurant.  It didn't disappoint. (mostly)  I enjoyed their hefeweizen. (Seeing a pattern here?)  I was feeling a bit peckish, so I ordered the cheesy corn dogs, because there is never a bad time for a corn dog.  I was not aware they were only half corn dogs. Alas, there were three halves brought out on a plate. (slight disappointment)  They were served with three types of mustard; horseradish, coarse deli, and dijon.  The mustards were VERY tasty, but I didn't care much for the color of the horseradish mustard; kind of purple-ish.  Had a couple more beers, and decided I was still hungry. It helped that it was now happy hour. :)  I was pondering the buffalo sliders, but I decided to get a hamburger. I was glad I made that choice. Turns out the corn dogs only made me more hungry than I thought I was.  The burger was delicious! (thanks, guys!)  Filled me right up.  I am glad I finally had the opportunity to patronize the District, and I look forward to returning again, and again.  Also, as I arrived too late to be seated in the dining room, I sat at the bar. Matt was the bartender, and I commend his service; my beer never went empty without the question of "Another?" being asked, and my food was delivered promptly. Matt also made great conversation, when there was a moment.  Only other thing I'd say; the coffee in the carafe at the bar was not terribly hot.

I love pupusas!  OMG they are so delicious!  I had two; one with just pork meat and one with mixed beans, pork and cheese.  I WANT TO EAT NOTHING ELSE!  And the price can't be beat! $2.10 US each!  They are served with something not unlike coleslaw which is kind of sour. It makes a lovely contrast to the savory of the pupusa.  The only complaint I had; need more beer selection.  I had no idea a treasure like this was so close to where I live!  YUM!

I went back to @SalvadorenoAZ tonight, after seeing a mini pupusa picture tonight on Facebook.  So glad I did; it'd been WAAAY too long!  I got the three pupusa combo, but should have gotten the two, as I barely finished two of them. And I had none of the slaw stuff that comes with it.  As I write this, I fear I may actually explode.  If you have never had a pupusa, your life has no meaning or purpose.  Ok, that might be a bit harsh, but just a little.  These things are so good, it's a wonder they don't have a line out the door all the time!  While I was in tonight I had a wonderful conversation with the owner about things they are working on, and let me tell you, I'm super excited.  Tomorrow, improve your life, and get thee to one of the Salvadoreño restaurants around the valley, post haste!  Then come here, and tell everyone how magical it is!  BTW: they have vegetarian, and vegan options, if you're "one of those people"...

I was invited to @SalvadorenoAZ for a special preview tasting of their Fuego #pupusa, with jalepenos and queso.  It was AMAZING!!! Muy delicioso!!  I decided I wanted more, so I ordered a fuego carne asada pupusa.  It is now the only thing I will be ordering!!!  Thank you, @SalvadoreñoAZ!!!

I returned to Hanny's with the @FoodiesLikeUs Light Rail Dine Around (#PHXLRDA).  We were initially served trays of thinly-sliced prosciutto, cheese, pistachios, and cantaloupe. They also brought bruscetta, and tapenade, which was delicious.  After a short while, they tried to kill me.  Seriously, they brought out two types of pizza; a pepperoni and sausage, and combination style pizza.  The pizzas were hands-down some of the best pizza I've ever had in my life. It was amazing.  Both come on think crust, the way pizza is meant to be. The sausage and pepperoni is now my most sought after food.  If I told you I ate an entire pizza, it's more likely an understatement than exaggeration.  I did not have any cocktails, but I love the look of their copper cups when they're ice cold.  I enjoyed myself, and will return to Hanny's, without a doubt.

Went there for a tweetup event.  Nice location. Parking garage is a bit far from the actual restaurant, but whatever. At least they didn't require valet.  The tweetup took place on the back patio, which was reserved for the event. Really, REALLY nice layout on the patio. The inside looked pretty nice, but I didn't pay a lot of attention.  Half-price happy hour was fantastic! $4 brew whose name I can't recall, $5 personal pizza, with ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE (FTW!) that was delicious (despite being curiously named the Kona), and pretty good coffee for $2.50.  I'd go back here in a second for a nice dinner date or client meeting. (If I had clients)  The staff was MOSTLY attentive, but there were a lot of people present. I'll ignore that aspect for the time being.  Can't yet say I'd HIGHLY recommend as I have only sampled the lighter faire, but I would recommend this place to those looking for something in the North Valley.

The location is very convenient for me as it is 4 blocks from work.  On Mondays they have a kids sing and dance activity at 10 AM, which is a lot of fun.  They have a good selection of books, music CDs, and DVDs.  They also have drive-thru drop-off and pick-up.

Love the pulpy orange juice, appreciate the coffee carafe.  Ordered the chicken-fried steak and eggs, with a biscuit and side of gravy.  Steak was a tad bit tough, probably the cut rather than the cooking. Gravy was very good, excellent texture and mouth feel, good flavor. Biscuit was great, eggs were well prepared.  Free WiFi is nice.  The location dictates I'm not likely to return, but it was nice.

I went to @avalonscttsdle with @PHXtastecasting.  We were served a tasting menu, courtesy of Chef Charles Stotts.  We started with an ahi with ponzu. It was amazing, and had a wonderfully distinct sesame flavor! We also had carpaccio, very soft and tender.  Next up, three soups; Lobster Bisque,  Bacon Vichyssoise, and Creamy Tomato The bisque was velvety smooth, powerful, but with a subtle lobster essence. Creamy, warm, and delicious! The vichyssoise had a hint of bacon, very creamy and smooth. A perfect cold-day soup! The tomato soup. I'm not a tomato soup fan, but I would spend my last few dollars for this soup. Slightly peppery, but not too bold, great consistency. With grilled cheese, you'd never need anything else!  Next up were the entrees and sides. Polenta; subtle flavor, creamy texture. Pork; bacon wrapped, served with apple sauce. Reminded me of the leaves changing color. Bone marrow bread pudding; let me just say, I would kill for this. I don't mean that abstractly. I would murder you for yours if you had some. Twice. It's that good. It is the epitome of comfort food. Lobster tails; eh. Kinda tough, but good flavor. Ricotta gnocchi; nice flavor, perfect consistency. New York Strip; perfect temperature and color, really good flavor. It would be a crime to put any kind of sauce or seasoning on this steak. Spinach; delicious!  Dessert was a red velvet cheesecake ensemble; 2 oz scoop of cheesecake on a medallion of red velvet cake, with a cream cheese frosting. SOOOO GOOOOD!!!  Avalon was a great time. Nice decor, good lighting, but they lose a star because I didn't like the way there were nothing but extremely high-end cars parked right in front by the door.  I may return, but the cost dictates it won't be soon, or often.

I was quite excited at the prospect of going to Bantu. I've recently been learning about African culture and cuisine and was looking forward to tasting it.  I can't say I'm happy with the results.  The location is decent; close enough to downtown to be convenient. Parking is plentiful.  The decor is not what I would call African. More an amalgam of all previous incarnations of restaurants at this location; Mediterranean, Italian, French.  The dining room is quite small. There are a few tables for four and one large raised table that seats approx. 10. The patio is quite spacious, but there is a considerable amount of traffic noise from 7th Avenue.  The waitress started me off with fried plantains and a spicy sauce for dipping.  The plantains tasted and felt like what I'd imagine a banana flavored potato chip would taste and feel like. Not at all unpleasant, and I ate several.  The sauce, while spicy, was more reminiscent of Latin America than Africa.  Still, it was a nice complement to the plantains.  I ordered coconut stew with chicken, and rice. It was quite tasty, but mildly unpleasant in that the chicken was almost as much bone as meat. Other diners I was with shared that complaint.  The rice was good; fluffy, properly cooked.  I was quite disappointed when I ordered what the waitress said was an African beer only to learn that it was in fact a Vietnamese beer.  All in all the experience was enjoyable, but the food was hardly enough to draw me back.

Ok, seriously @Starbucks, there should not be visible evidence on the toilet seat that the prior user was... um.... having a bad day.  Gross.  No other comments. That's just unacceptable.  BTW: after being there at least 90 minutes, I used the restroom again just prior to leaving, and there had been zero cleaning done.  NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS LOCATION!

This used to be Johnny's Uptown.  Started our evening here for the Lightrail Pubcrawl.  The location is in the back corner of a strip mall, and isn't obvious. More signage would help.  The interior is nice. They have an interesting raised seating area in the rear of the place that, when packed, would be appreciated.  The prices weren't great, but as we were doing the pub crawl we were afforded discounts for having worn the t shirt.  I would not likely return, as the musical genre isn't my norm, and the pricing is a bit high. But it is a nice place, and they should be thanked for their participation in the pub crawl.

I went to @PostinoCentral for lunch today. cc: @PostinoWineCafe  (How interesting that they don't even use the twitter for this location)  I won't be going back any time soon. I am required to give at least one star. The second star was because the food was actually very good.  You most definitely did not earn two stars.  When I come to your establishment, it is not your place to determine that my not ordering something gives you license to treat me and my party like shit.  Water was spilled on one of our group by one of the servers, and no offer was made to get a napkin, or help clean it up.  Our actual server, who was adorned with diamond studs in her chest, gave the very distinct impression that everything she was doing for us was a chore.  At the end of the meal, when I asked her to separate the checks, she nearly had a conniption. Excuse me for asking you to do your job, and not make assumptions about me or my party, simply because we aren't all falling over ourselves to buy each other's meal.  I had the Nine Iron panini. It was pretty tasty. I had it with the salad, which was also delicious.  Neither, individually or collectively, could have been good enough to overcome the deplorable treatment we received.  Perhaps the fact that I wear a cowboy hat and boots is what gave the waitress the idea she had license to be an unreasonable bitch.  Perhaps it's that we (our group) doesn't fit the wine-snob, or urban hipster stereotype.  Regardless, you lost a potential regular. Nicely done.

Cinnamon roll was delicious, if a bit dry.  The table at the edge of the door, with the breeze blowing, was fantastic.  The tater tots were pretty good, the burger was very well presented, but was a bit uncooked.  The funky monkey French toast was goddamned amazing! HUGE slices, extra thick. Definitely want that again!  Great atmosphere, great food. Only complaint was our food was quite staggered.

First time to @galloblanco tonight. What a great experience!  Went for a social/journalist type event, #JDEB. Had a nice evening, chatting, getting to know a few new people.  Enjoyed the $5 pints of hefeweizen, and appreciated the bartender's attentiveness to my dislike of fruit in my beer. (Orange in wheat beer?! Amateur!)  After a while, the hunger set in, and a few of us decided to have dinner in the restaurant.  I ordered the sopa del dia, which was chicken tortilla, and the breakfast burrrito (served all day, woot!) which was chorizo and egg, one of the few perfect meals in existence.  I had high hopes and expectations for this meal, as many of my friends dine here regularly.  The food did not disappoint in the slightest!  The soup was VERY hearty! Chock full of generous chunks of chicken, and flavorful bits of tortilla, and plenty of flavor. Delicious! And nearly a meal on its own.  But I was hungry, so not quite.  The burrito was superb! For starters, it was huge. Given the price, and the type of establishment I had assumed GB to be, I wasn't expecting such a large portion.  Nonetheless, the burrito was delicious, and had plenty of egg and chorizo, and a very tasty pico, rolled into a nice-sized tortilla.  The bartender, as well as our restaurant server, were attentive, and very personable.  Oh, did I mention they serve Cartel Coffee?  Yes. Another plus for them.  Gallo is on the west side of town, and a distance south of me, but I think it is now imperative that I return, as often as possible.  I am dying to try their chilaquiles! And the guac, as I didn't get the chance tonight.  Yes, I will be back, without question!

Went to @ClarendonHotel for the Halloween bash. Stopped in to @GalloBlanco for dinner.  My girlfriend's first time in.  We ordered one each of the cochinita (pork), carne asada beef, and pescado (fish) tacos.  The pork was PHENOMENAL! Great flavor and seasoning, delicious.  The beef was equally good, but my girl dominated that one. :D  The fish taco, with ahi and red cabbage, and guacamole, was unbelievably good. See, I'm not a fan of seafood in my tacos. Or even in any of my mexican food.  But I would order a dozen of these, and want more!  The crunch of the cabbage was a great contrast to the ahi, and the guacamole made for a perfect finish.  Thanks for another great meal! You have a new fan, as well. :)

Joined @SMUNCHPhoenix at @GalloBlanco.  For my first breakfast at Gallo, I ordered Chilaquiles Verde, and my girlfriend had the Chorizo and Eggs.  We were both very happy with our choices!  The chilaquiles was delicious, with the crispy corn tortillas providing a nice contrast.  The chorizo and eggs were definitely in line with what I consider to be authentic.  I am definitely a fan of Gallo, and will return as often as time and money allow.

Dropped in to @LocalBreeze with @ClsBallerina and @PhxDowntowner, and I'm very glad I did.  I've been meaning to get down to visit, but since I don't live in Downtown, it's not easy.  I had a Georgia Peach Tea, which was about 90% peach vodka, and 10% not vodka, and 100% delicious. I can see this being my go to drink at Local Breeze.  For my late dinner, I opted for the Fernando's Chicken sandwich, because the pepperoncini and jalapeño jack caught my eye. That was a hell of a good sandwich!  I didn't pay much attention to the actual venue, mostly because I was already slightly inebriated when I arrived, and considerably more so when I left, thanks to the tea.  But I will definitely be back.

Dropped in today for #SMUNCH with @SMUNCHPhoenix.  I think I am in love!  Had the Bananas Foster French Toast, and the Sawmill Gravy with Biscuits.  Wow.  The french toast is indescribably delicious! The bananas foster topping is simply delectable, and the thick-sliced challah bread makes for a treat of epic proportions!  Plus, the full order of french toast is a meal for two! Huge!  For the kids, we ordered the PB&J french toast, half order.  They couldn't even finish it!  We sat outside, near the bar. The verandah was PERFECT!  Local Breeze is one of the places that make me wish I could live downtown.  Well done!

I only had drinks, no food.  The bartender was very attentive, and poured a great drink.  There was a DJ with a decent mix. A bit loud for my tastes, but I'm more of a social person than a dancer. It's really for everyone's benefit.  The atmosphere was very nice. I love the patio setting. I also like that it is right on a major pedestrian street, which allows for great people-watching.  I'd go back. I'd like to try the food, too.

I got wind of the @PetiteMaisonAZ Staff Dinner, w/ Guest @ChefBeckett, from @JuxtaPalate, so I decided to check it out.  I'm so very glad I did.  For a fantastic price, I had two of the best enchiladas I may have ever eaten; Rock Shrimp & Cheese Enchiladas w/Avocado Salsa & Guajillo Chile Sauce  The presentation was great, with plenty of color, and good contrast. The guajillo sauce thoroughly covered, but did not drench.  Each bite was chock full of shrimp and gooey cheese, and there wasn't any variation of content that is often found in enchiladas.  From first bite to last, it was a pleasure to enjoy.  The venue itself is tiny, with maybe 8 or 10 tables, and bar seating for about 12 or 14. Tonight it was PACKED!  Wendy, whom I believe is a manager (sorry, Wendy) informed me that on the Guest Chef nights, the Staff Dinners have larger turnouts. Given the attendance tonight, I can readily accept that as truth.  I have been wanting to try Petite Maison for quite some time, but time and money haven't always worked in my favor. I am thankful to Ty for announcing this particular Staff Dinner, and introducing me to the wonders Petite Maison possesses.  I must return soon to try the Saumon Fume Rillette!  Thanks to Chef Beckett for the wonderful meal, and a hearty good luck to him in his new venture!

Free homemade soup!  I had the lemon chicken rice soup. Very hearty, chunks of celery, and carrot, flavorful broth, tender, but not overcooked rice. Delicious!  For my meal I had the classic gyro combo. Generous amount of meat, decent amount of tzatziki, soft and warm pita, chunks of tomato and onion.  Delicious! Would return!

I wasn't terribly hungry, so I just had the Muffaletta Cheese Bread appetizer.  It was amazing! And a meal in and of itself!  Good beer selection, nice patio.  This particular location isn't near me, so I wouldn't likely return, or if I did, often.  But I would go back if I were in the area.

Had the cilantro jalapeño hummus. It was amazing!  The amount of hummus was too much for the two warm pieces of pita bread, which means I get leftovers!  I have enjoyed my experience every time I have been to Pita Jungle. I don't live close, but I will probably go back.

Went to @robertemmetsaz with @mikescott8 and @dsrthoney. My second time there.  Nice place. Has a good neighborhood kinda feel to it I appreciate.  Had some food this time, prepared by the wonderful Danny, who tears it up in the little kitchen.  I had a burger that was supposed to be pretty hot, and had him add bacon, then I put some Tabasco on for good measure. (I like my burgers to make me sweat)  Let me tell you, that was hands down one of the best burgers I've had in my life. The patty was huge, and the cook time was perfect. (They never even asked how I wanted it) I mowed through it so fast I think people wondered if I tasted it at all.  The fries were pretty good, too. But the nachos, those were awesome. I only had a few, but delicious!  It was a Wednesday night, and they were doing trivia. Their trivia night has an advantage over many other places; you can win real prizes.  First prize gets a $25 gift card to Robert Emmet's. Second prize gets a free pitcher of beer.  You have to have at least 2 players on your team. The questions were pretty tough, and I don't think I'd have won.  The dude running trivia is kinda loud, so if that bothers you, skip Wed. night.  Otherwise, get thee to Robert Emmet's post-haste, and enjoy thyself! And if you see Bobby or Lea, tell 'em Vern sent you.

Though I've been to the museum previously, I just went for the Women Who Rock exhibit.  The exhibit was wonderful, and the pieces were laid out well.  The museum provided a complimentary photo booth, which my children enjoyed.  The price of admission dictates infrequent visits, but I have always enjoyed going, and will return.

Went to ask getting my body guard screen cover replaced. I was told I need to register online, and they'll send a replacement in the mail.  Asked the dumbass employee "How do you remove it". He proceeds to start peeling it, cracking the fuck out of it.  I tell him I never instructed him to do so, and thus I feel they owe me a new one.  He says I need to register online, blah blah.  I tell him I want a manager.  Todd comes out, full of attitude, essentially tells me tough shit, I asked the employee to remove it.  Now I have no screen protector, and likely won't, until I come back from my next road trip.  Fucking assholes.

Serious shithole.  Dumbass drivers, sitting in the fuel island, eating their fucking meals.  The entire complex reeks of urine, not just the peeing lot.  Would never choose to stay here. You have to pay $10 for the night, or buy $50 fuel, or have $20 in receipts from the store/fast food places (total combined). For $10 you can stay at Danny's, across from the Flying J. Much cleaner, nicer facilities, and has security.

Attended the @SpaFitFinder launch party, with @spacephx.  I can't say much about the place, other than, even taking into consideration the number of people present, it felt cramped.  The TrimTini (?) I had was really delicious; vodkatini with lemon zest.  A very nice gentleman, who works at Urban 7, was very gracious in making sure to stop by every time he brought out a new platter of hors d'oeuvres. Everything he brought was delicious, including the ceviche, which I'm not particularly fond of.  Urban 7 isn't the type of place I'm attracted to, so it's not likely I will return any time soon.  But it was a nice event, and I enjoyed myself.

Went to @smashburger for a @PHXtastecasting event.  Our hosts, Kurt and Christina, were amazing. Very informative, and very helpful in guiding us through both the menu, as well as the background of the restaurant and the company.  I have never been to a burger joint that offered a fried egg, to go on your burger, so I of COURSE had to get it.  I went with the 1/2 Lb. Arizona Smashburger; Habanero cheese, guacamole, chipotle mayo, and jalapenos, on a chipotle bun, with added Applewood Smoked Bacon, and the aforementioned fried egg.  The burger patty was so big, it literally eclipsed the bun! The egg was a beautiful addition! I put the top bun on and SMASHED!!!  First bite was AMAZING!!!  Personally, I would not have the guac, as I think it detracts from the heat of the habanero and chipotle too much, but I definitely enjoyed the burger!  I would also not get this particular burger with the egg, as it doesn't, in my mind, mesh well with the other ingredients. Perhaps WITH the egg, but WITHOUT the guac, might improve it.  The smashfries are pure goodness! Tossed with garlic oil, rosemary, garlic, and other herbs, they were fantastic!  The haystack onions were delicious, but I didn't have enough to say more about them.  One of the menu items that sets Smash Burger apart, are their veggie frites; flash fried asparagus, carrot sticks, and green beans.  SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD!!!!!!  Served ranch dressing, but not at all needed.  We were able to sample both the chocolate, and strawberry shakes.  Both were delicious, but the strawberry stood out as being something more than you can get at BK or Jack in the Box. Really good.  They also have salads available, and all of their burger items can be "smashchicken" orders, but really, what's the point?  They have a selection of beer and wine available, which is kind of unique for a burger joint. The beer selection is very nice, offering amber and hefeweizen choices, as well as some more mainstream selections.  I am, without a doubt, a fan. I wish I lived closer, but it isn't too far away.

I went to @TheVigAZ Uptown, originally for just a couple beers, but I ended up having the crab and artichoke dip, with the spiced pita bread.  OMG!!!  The pita chips were delicious alone, but the crab and artichoke dip was amazing!!  Had a couple hefeweizen's, as well.  Love the space in the back; kind of an outdoor feel, but not really outside.  The bocce ball pit is pretty cool. If I go back, I may try to get a game going.  Prices are reasonable.  I will be back.

Went to @TheVigAZ Uptown with @UpAgency this morning to see @BrittneyShipp, and be part of a remote video segment.  I will give them a pass for the staff shortcomings today; things were a bit hectic for them, with the news crew being on site.  We were there for quite a while, so The Vig provided everyone with a nice "starter" of yogurt, granola, and sliced strawberries. It was delicious, and would easily make a great, light, healthy breakfast.  When we were able to order, we chose the french toast, the huevo banco, the Uptown and At 'Em, and one of the childrens dishes. (We shared, and took some home. Don't judge)  The french toast was simply AMAZING! Didn't even use the syrup, as it wasn't needed.  The huevo banco was also fantastic! It was my first experience with sauteed bananas, and I'm definitely a fan!  The pork was juicy and delicious, and the tortilla base was really good.  The orange juice was wonderful. The coffee was nice and hot, but not as readily available as I hoped.  This was my first experience having an actual meal at The Vig Uptown. I will excuse the issues I observed as being the result of the news crew.  In any case, they were not enough to dissuade future visits. In fact, I think The Vig Uptown may soon become a regular haunt for me. I'm hoping to get a good game of bocce ball in.  Thanks again to both The Vig and Up Agency, and especially to Ty, for being such a great guy!  P.S. One of these days I'll get myself over to the original Vig.

Wow. I've enjoyed @TheVigAZ Uptown on all my previous visits.  My most recent experience could rightly be called the opposite of everything before.  I am recently single. I decided yesterday to get out of the house to get out of my funk.  I did something I really never do; I went out, alone.  I don't really like to go out into social situations alone, for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that I think society tends to treat individuals who are in a social setting as pariahs.  The servers at The Vig Uptown hammered home how much that notion of being a pariah is true.  I went out onto the back patio area, and sat down.  There were two or three other tables with people out there, and the inside wasn't packed.  I watched as one server fawned over one particular table, but failed to even acknowledge my presence.  My irritation increased when a couple new people arrived, and joined the group already at that table. They then relocated to the seating around the fire pit.  The server was quick to attend to the new arrivals, and even enlisted the assistance of another server in getting all fresh glasses of water for everyone.  And yet, I sat.  There were two other servers that were attending to the other tables, but neither of them seemed to notice my presence, either.  I sat for just over 20 minutes with nary a nod of the head, much less a glass of water, or a drink order. Sad, because I was looking forward to trying the orange kreamsicle.  I decided my singular presence was not welcome.  As I exited the building, I informed the young lady at the front that I had waited 20 minutes without so much as a visit to ask if I wanted to order anything.  I suppose one might argue that I could merely have flagged someone down, rather than come home and write an angry tirade on Yelp.  But no, it is not my obligation as your customer to be seen, it is entirely your obligation, as a service-based business, to be attentive of your customers, and serve their needs.  On this day, you fell flat on your face.  I don't know if that has pushed me to the point I will not return, but I definitely have some animosity over this experience.

@TheVigAZ Uptown has redeemed themselves.  I went last night with a friend, just for cocktails. Sat on the patio.  Our server was very attentive, and made us both feel very comfortable.  I finally got to try the Oranje Kreamsicle. OH EMM GEE  It tastes almost exactly like a 50/50 bar, with vodka.  And seriously, that's just awesome!  My companion had a couple glasses of cab, and had no complaints.  The DJ arrived, and had a pretty decent selection of music.  I ordered the double down, and it was really delicious. The baba ganoush was really flavorful.  Overall a nice time was had.  (Full disclosure; as a result of my previous experience, I was contacted by the owner, who apologized, and sent me a gift card, which I used last night. It did not cover the tab entirely, so I do not feel any bias should be assumed, as there exists none. My review is as honest as it would be if I were paying 100%. That being said, Thank You Mr. Woodbury. I will definitely be returning to The Vig Uptown)  I have yet to try the original Vig. I should do that.

Went for the $5 burger night. Chorizo seasoned beef on a bun is definitely a winning concept. With red onions, lettuce, and chipotle mayo, it was amazing.  The shoestring fries are always a hit.  Also had the Double Down. Love the hummus, and the baba ganoush was a hit with my companion.

Oh @TheVigAZ, you usually do so well, but when you fail me, it's always an epic fail. Last night, you fell flat on your face.  I ordered the Vigazz Burger, anticipating greatness.  My girlfriend and her daughter received their food, and finished their meals. I got nothing.  While my girlfriend was still eating, I inquired with one of the back servers about my burger, and was told it was almost ready.  15 or 20 minutes after my party finished eating, I was still waiting.  The other people around me, who'd ordered around the same time as I (some before, most after) were finished with their meals, and still I waited.  I had by this time decided I no longer wanted my meal, but no server was present to inform.  While I waited for the server to come by to deliver the inevitable check, I noticed people who'd arrived AFTER we ordered, getting their meals.  And still, I waited.  Finally, after over 30 minutes, and nearly having to yell to get her attention (she was delivering more food to people who came long after we ordered, right next to us), our server came over.  When we informed her that I did not receive my meal, and that my girlfriend's order was incorrect (onions and tomatoes present, despite a request to not have them), and instructed her to remove my meal, she just asked if I wanted it to-go.  When your service comes up so short as to completely miss a meal, you don't merely offer to make it to-go.  In fairness, when she brought the check, she stated she'd spoken to the manager, and he'd also removed my girlfriend's burger from the bill.  It was a nice gesture, but last night it was too little, too late. I went home hungry, with a major headache.  I love The Vig, but sometimes it's a major disappointment...

Great patio!  $4 PBR, Schlitz, and Hamm's!  Brisket sliders with grilled onions are amazing!  Good service, friendly staff.  One bad thing; the greyhound I ordered had no discernible liquor in it.

I joined @PatrickEm and @PaulValach at @TheDucePHX for brunch this morning.  I had their cinnamon pecan french toast, but without the pecans.  It was simply amazing!  Amanda was our server, and she epitomizes what I think a server should be. Keep her around, Duce!  Also had fresh-squeezed orange juice. Delicious!  I think the Duce would do well to add a few fans, just to move the air a bit.  But I really enjoy this place, and will definitely be back.

Tonight the @phxtastecasting crew rolled in to @BigDaddysBBQAZ for our #bigdaddystasting.  Right off the bat, I knew this was my kind of place; cast iron bath tubs full of iced-down beer behind the bar, a big Budweiser Clydesdale mural on the brick wall, a wall-rack loaded down with mesquite for the smoker.  Oliver was our gracious host for the evening. He attended to us with aplomb, ensuring we were all comfortable, and had drinks, prior to the feast commencing.  I partook of the Big Daddy's BBQ Honey Ale, which was served ice cold in a frosty mug.  This is a beer to savor. This is a beer that makes the heat dissipate, and settles the nerves. Delicious, subtle, not too heavy.  We began our feeding frenzy with the house smoked wings. They are served with a dipping sauce, but if you appreciate the beauty of smoked meats, you won't have need of it. Drumettes and wings are served, along with the obligatory celery sticks.  Refreshingly absent was sign of ranch dressing. That alone made me smile. (Yes, S.L., I thought of you...)  Next we were treated to fried pickles. They were still very hot, but that only made them that more scrumptious! They did have something akin to ranch sauce, but I did not dip, as there was no need.  Then began the cavalcade of smoked meat; ribs and brisket, smoked for 14-16 hours, served on a platter, with the custom house bbq sauce; pulled pork, smoked for 4 hours, served with the house bbq sauce; tri-tip, served with the house bbq sauce  The ribs were un-frikkin-believably good. Best ribs I've ever had in my adult life, hands down. They use a proprietary rub, that we were informed would soon be available for purchase. I considered lifting some from the kitchen, it was so good.  The brisket was tender and juicy, and oh so good. Tri-tip should always aspire to what Big Daddy's produces. The color was perfect, as was the texture and flavor.  The pulled pork was so good, you could eat it with a fork, right off the platter, and you would never get a weird look from anyone. Mostly because they would also be doing it. The pork also comes with perfect-sized, grilled slider buns.  We were also provided with baked beans, that were sweet, but with a slight bite to them that cut the sweetness. The cornbread was devine; cake-y, and slightly sweet, but a perfect addition to any bbq meal. The cole slaw was good, but nothing great. It doesn't need improvement. Sweet potato french fries, with cinnamon and sugar, made a nice complement to the meal.  For me, however, the pièce de résistance, the highlight of the evening, was the mac and cheese. According to Oliver, they cook 50 pounds of raw pasta a day, which equates to 150 pounds of mac, before the cheese. I could not believe it was only 50 pounds.  Made with several different kinds of cheese, panned, then baked, to crisp the top.  This was one of the three best mac and cheese dishes I've ever had in my life.  And I know mac and cheese.  I had to bring some home it was so good.  The decor consists of picnic tables, with umbrellas, and has a general "ranch" kind of feel. Perfect for a redneck like me!  They also have a patio, replete with misters for the Arizona heat. There are also a couple large, garage-style doors, that are opened in the evening, providing an outdoorsy kind of feel to the entire dining area.  There is shuffleboard available in the bar, and a miniature "General Store" area, with golden oldies such as "Boston Baked Beans" candy.  And last, but surely not least, each meal comes with a casino chip, that you may save for a future visit (yeah right!), or cash in right away, for a dessert treat. The dessert choices are those you would find on an ice-cream truck; Drumstick, ice cream bar, chocolate-chip cookie ice cream sandwich, bullets, etc.  I will return to Big Daddy's, and I will bring my children. I'm certain we will all leave very happy, and VERY full.

Went to @eatverde for my first #smunch with @smunchphoenix.  Right off the bat, this is a combined review, as I'm including my experience tasting Verde's red and green pork from the @GetYourPHX event at @CoHootsPHX.  The layout, and interior decor of Verde is simple, minimalist, but perfect for the image they seem to want to present; don't get caught up thinking about the seats, or the tables, or the art, just enjoy the incredible food we make.  And they do.  The green chile pork is simply the best I've had, ever. The red chile pork is fantastic, and I would die a happy man if I never ate anything else.  Yes, it is that good.  But wait, it gets better; they make their own tortillas, by hand, from scratch ingredients.  And how are the tortillas, you ask.  Let me just say that I probably ate about 2 dozen, when Joe brought his product to Co+Hoots.  This morning, for Smunch, I opted for a chorizo and egg burrito, because morning + Mexican food = chorizo. (I think that's actually what it means in Spanish)  Honestly, I was slightly disappointed by the chorizo. I know most people dislike chorizo because it is so greasy. But what they don't understand, and I do, is that the oil is where the flavor is. The spices permeate the oil, not the meat. Sure, the meat has flavor, but when the meat is too dry, it certainly has a decreased presence.  Admittedly, I may have had too-high expectations for all things Verde, after experiencing the bliss of their green chile pork.  Regardless, the burrito was tasty, and a sizable portion, for a really good price. There was a good amount of egg, as well. I will likely get it again, simply because chorizo is my go-to for breakfast.  One more thing; the coffee. I was informed that it was merely a generic coffee brand, but the flavor was considerably better than Denny's or Carrow's, or even the Circle K coffee. I didn't just appreciate the coffee, I enjoyed it.  For the burrito alone, I would have only given 4 stars. But the combination of the previous pork experience, the pleasant coffee experience, and the interior that I definitely appreciate, I will give them five.  I will, without question, return to Verde, time and again.

Pastrami tasted good, but had a lot of tough tissue, and was near impossible to bite through. Rye bread was low-quality.  Curly fries were tasty.  Cole slaw was yummy! Really the highlight of the meal.  Lemon bar was delicious, if a bit subdued. (I like the lemon to pucker my face)  The brownie was warm and chocolatey, but too many nuts.  Probably my only visit, unless someone invites me.

I was invited to a special @SmashBurgerPHX Sneak Peek Preview Party. Of course I attended!  Our hosts, Kurt and Christina, whom I'd met previously, at the SmashBurger location on Cambelback, were again amazing. Very attentive to everyone's needs. Quick to pass you a sample of their DELICIOUS shakes, or a cup for some soda while waiting in line.  Tonight I opted for the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Smashburger, with an added fried egg, and chipotle sauce and mayo. I also added some Cholula, because it's so damn good!  We also had an order of their fantastic haystack onions, and an order of their signature Smashfries, which I described in my other review; "The smashfries are pure goodness! Tossed with garlic oil, rosemary, garlic, and other herbs, they were fantastic!"  Sadly, they were out of their veggie frittes, which was sad, but understandable, given the popularity of the free food event. :D  I have been really wanting to get back to SmashBurger since the previous @PHXTasteCasting event, but life and finances have prevented me. I was OVERjoyed at getting the VIP invite!  Thanks again, Kurt and Christina!!!  P.S. I did not see, and did not inquire about, any beer or wine. I know it is available at the Camelback location. Perhaps they are awaiting a license?  P.P.S. If anyone wants to see my previous review of a different SmashBurger location; http://goo.gl/QldC

I needed to get an MMR shot for my new job. The county health department provided me with the number for the Take Care Clinic, who confirmed that I could receive the vaccination with just a walk-in, no appointment required.  As my doctor wanted a $75 fee on top of the $85 for the vaccine, and Take Care only charged me $95.99 total, it was a no-brainer.  Due to my own error in not carefully looking at the website, I showed up just as the Nurse Practitioner was needing to take lunch.  I occupied myself for an hour, then returned. Unfortunately, she did not return until 40 minutes after I did.  Alas, I was the first patient in the queue, and once she was ready to receive patients, I was in and out relatively quickly.  The N.P., whose name I can not recall at the moment, had very good bedside manners, and answered my questions, without any hint of being bothered by them. (Something I've grown accustomed to from many in the medical profession)  Once the vaccine was administered, and the requisite wait time expired, she ensured I had everything I needed, including an additional copy of the record of my vaccination, with her own handwritten notes.  I had a very good experience, and would not hesitate to recommend a Take Care Clinic to anyone.  Take Care Clinics are available at many Walgreens locations, but check the website to be sure.

Received an invite to @SugarShackAZ Sports Grill Blogger/Social Media Dinner, thanks to @Table12Xtina.  Emma, our server, had a really GREAT smile, and really great service!  The grilled romaine salad was amazing! The balsamic was perfect! And the caramelized onions, bacon, and bleu cheese really made it pop!  The cuban sandwich was out of this world! The garlic mayo, and dijon mustard (a break from tradition) made this my new favorite Cuban sandwich in the valley. (Sorry, Carly's...) Get it with either the tots or the onion rings!  The Sugar Shack's owners, Todd and Trisha Steadman, came to our table to introduce themselves, and thank us for coming. Todd is a really great guy, and he seemed genuinely interested in our feedback on the food.  Looking forward to heading back to The Sugar Shack! $1 domestics on Wednesdays!

I went to @BlissreBAR for @RadiatePHX, and I'm very glad to have done so.  The business is actually in two buildings, with the bar on the right, and the restaurant on the left.  The bar itself is a bit on the small side, but having been to the previous business (Nine 05) I can say that I will enjoy many cocktails on their patio, which is huge.  The drink prices are very reasonable, and their beer selection, while small, is packed with goodness!  After having a few beers, some of us decided to take advantage of the Tuesday Two-Fer; two burgers, two beers (domestic only Si) and a large order of fries, for $20.  Now, $10 may sound a bit high for a burger, but let me tell you, I would pay $10 for the burger I had there without a doubt. And don't forget, that also includes a beer, and fries.  And not just any old fries; you get your choice of parmesan fries, vinegar and salt, and traditional. We opted for the parmesan, and I was very happy with them.  The burger was thick and juicy (#TWSS), and came with two different kinds cheese, lettuce, tomato (which I declined), and bacon. Not just any bacon, thick, applewood smoked, nommy delicious, BACON!  While I don't live near downtown, I do love seeing the area flourishing, and it's wonderful to see this corner alive again. The location is great, and its proximity to Roosevelt for First Friday portends great things for them.  I will definitely be back.

Went to #buzzcation @blissrebar. Enjoyed the evening immensely.  Sat down for some grub, had the pretzel bread, and the loaded mac-and-cheese.  The pretzel bread came with a honey-mustard sauce that was amazing, a cheese sauce that was fantastic, and a tomato jam that I didn't try because I don't like ketchup.  I have always loved the space they occupy, and think they have one of the best patios in town.  Always have a good time there, and will definitely be back.

Jane, one of the owners, is one of the most gracious, and pleasant business owners I know.  Tanya is one of the most awesome bartenders (and friends) I've ever known.  I have been going for about a year, and I feel like this is my "Cheers". I know many of the other patrons, and I know the staff well. They always treat me like a friend, and the atmosphere is very welcoming.  They also have free WiFi, and one of the best patios in Phoenix.  They have free pool every Wednesday night, and pool tournaments every Tue. and Thurs., plus free ping pong on the patio, and foosball and darts in the front room.  They have several large-screen televisions, with various sports events on.  If you like small, semi-dive bars, and you've not been, stop in and tell 'em Vern sent you. Trust me, you'll like it.

I'm adding one star for the patio, because it's a pretty awesome patio, despite the temperature the day I visited.  I had the chorizo and eggs breakfast.  Pretty good, but not great or amazing.  I gather this would be a more enjoyable place for an evening of beer drinking. I'll have to come back for that sometime.

Great little place, recommended to me by Tonia M. Bartz.  I went in today, and found a great pan (don't underestimate a great pan), and an ice cream maker, with two freezer bowls.  The thing is, I bought this same ice cream maker at a garage sale, not realizing it was missing the freezer bowl.  Now I have two complete ice cream makers to feed my inner fat kid!!  Good prices, too!

I went to #FirstService at @BigEarlsBBQ.  I love the decor! And the music was top notch redneck music!  Stephanie should bring water for everyone at the table  HUGE chunks in the bleu cheese!  Nachos was a good mixture of meat and cheese, and more than enough to be a meal.  Five cheese Mac'n had great flavor!  Pulled pork was tender and juicy. Baked beans great.  Potato salad had good flavor, but we were so stuffed we couldn't finish it.  I'm definitely headed back ASAP!

Flies everywhere up front. Seriously, at the bar, there must have been 20-30 buzzing around. Put up some damned flypaper, or get an air screen. Something.  Horrible waitress. She poured my beer till it overflowed, then just let the foam settle, then handed it to me, without topping it off, or wiping the glass.  We moved to a table, because we didn't want the flies to get in the wings we ordered.  On the way to our table, the waitress dropped plate, which shattered, causing broken shards of plate to hit me in the face. Seriously. She didn't say a word.  After we ate the wings, which were good enough to make me not hate having to give the one star, she came and asked if I wanted more water. I said no, I'm ok. She took my water! It wasn't empty, and I didn't ask her to remove it! WTF?!  Also, the men's bathroom was in disrepair, and smelled awful. The toilet appeared to be non-functional, there were tools and parts all over the floor, no sign on the door indicating a problem, nothing.  What a disaster that whole experience turned out to be! This place is definitely going on my "Never Return" list!

Pricey, but pretty damn good.  They would have had 5 stars, but inexplicably there was neither garlic or sesame oil available. In fact, all the sauces had some sort of sugar element, and were very "ketchupy".  Do not want.  They have a rewards program that sounds pretty good, but I won't be going there often given the distance.  I'd return with the person I went with, though. :)

Was invited to the @MonsterlandAZ grand re-opening. My roommate was the head chef, and had a table reserved for our party (30 people) for 7 PM.  The problem centered around the GM arbitrarily deciding that our party was not on the list, despite being shown by multiple people that we were, and arbitrarily deciding that we could be shuffled down the priority chain.  We agreed to wait for other tables to clear, and chose to move next door for drinks, while we waited for our table.  By 10 PM we decided to eat at the restaurant next door.  Myself and my friend left, but we learned that none of our party actually made it in to the venue, other than drinks.  This was a gross display of poor customer service, and ridiculous favoritism on the part of the GM.  I have not ever been, and will not ever go.

How can you not want to eat here?! The sign says "Breakfast, Lunch, Bacon"!!!  I had a chorizo and egg burrito that was really tasty.  I also had a maple bacon donut that very nearly put me in a (delicious and satisfactory) sugar coma!  The patio was wonderful, the service punctual, and the company was the best!  I will be back!

My mother got horse riding lessons for my girls, and Linda was a great instructor! Emily rode Rebel, a 13 year gelding, and Grace rode Caprice, an 8 year mare.  Linda was extremely patient with the girls, and helped them build their confidence on the horses. She taught them the proper way to hold the reins, how your feet should be positioned in the stirrups, and proper posture while riding.  Grace was much more confident, and by the end of the lesson was trotting around the arena very well.  Emily trotted a bit, but was more reserved.  It was a great experience for my girls, and I will probably take them back over the summer.

I arrived very early to pick up my daughters, so I went in for a beer.  I had a Negra Modelo, and after a bit, felt hungry.  Their prices are a bit extreme for just a snack, but the fresh-made guacamole sounded delicious, and was reasonably priced.  They prepare it table-side, and the anticipation of watching it being prepared makes it taste better. (True story)  It had large chunks of avocado, jalapenos, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, lemon juice, and is topped with pomegranate seeds.  One of the most amazing guacamoles I've ever had, and I have had, and made dozens of recipes.  I may have to head to the location outside the airport, and try one of their entrees.  If I spend any significant amount of time in the airport again, I'll certainly hit this spot again!

Took my daughters here for a quick, light meal.  I was unfamiliar with the business, and didn't know all their sandwiches were pressed.  I had a turkey sandwich, with bacon, and feta. It was AMAZING!  My daughters had turkey, and roast beef sandwiches, which were equally delicious.  I met the owner, who was very pleasant, and gracious.  I will likely return.

We went on a weekday, which probably helped minimize the notorious wait time.  We were seated at a high table, in the front/private dining room, which also serves as a storage location. There was a lot of traffic in and out, but not to the point of being bothersome, and the view out the front window made it well worth it.  I ordered the special, a Denver scramble, and had cinnamon raisin toast, with homemade strawberry jam.  The scramble was delicious, but the jam was amazing!  I enjoyed my meal, and my experience, and will likely return.

I had been eagerly anticipating the opening of a brewhouse in my neighborhood! I wasn't able to visit them, as my job keeps me away a lot.  Yesterday, I finally had the opportunity, and I'm so very glad I went.  Amy was a fantastic server! Friendly, attentive, efficient.  Ordered the seven flight. Started with the IPA. Not too hoppy, which is the biggest reason I'm not a fan of IPAs. Good balance. Brown: Nice rich flavor, no strong aftertaste Porter: A bit more dark and bitter than I prefer, but still tasty Belgian: Delicious, smooth, distinctly Belgian. Very much enjoyed this. Blonde: Eh, mostly men on this one. Not bad, just not really notable. Good basic beer for non beer lovers. Funk: has a very strong Weiss impression, like a shandy. Very refreshing, with definite citrus, and wheat impressions. Most liked beer so far! Hefeweizen: It's a hefe. An excellent hefe, to be sure, but I'm still impressed with the funk. This would be my winter beer, while the funk is my summer  Had the crab dip. VERY creamy, nice blackened top, very rich, delicious.  Ordered the steak sandwich, with both pepperjack, and bleu cheese. MESSY. Spicy, in a great way. The roll it's served on gets a bit too soggy, but is otherwise a great sandwich roll. Served with a metric tonne of fries!  I was given a sample of their bacon jam, and let me tell you, it's fantastic!  The live music was pleasant as well.  Candy, one of the owners, came out after my meal, and spoke to me for a bit about the business, and the challenges they faced getting approval, and also about the deplorable state of pay for cooks in Arizona.  Candy graciously discounted my bill, which will never elicit a complaint from me!

I've been three times now, and they have not lost steam.  Last night I enjoyed several glasses of the Lips of Faith Pluot (I had a designated driver), and I got to sample a new brew, but the name escapes me.  Our server, Nya (pronounced knee uh) was excellent, and very attendant.  We ordered the crab dip, the lumpia, and the BBQ sticks.  Nya brought some pretzel bread, and explained that the first lumpia order had been burned, so this should tide us over. It was very nice, and the honey butter was delicious!  The BBQ sticks were amazing; tender, flavorful, delicious! The lumpia was also great, but the sauce it's served with was fantastic!  This is definitely a great establishment, and Candy is a wonderful person, unafraid to come out and speak with her customers.  I will absolutely be returning.

Took my mother, and my daughters to dinner @NMTBrew tonight.  Once again had the lovely Nya as our server.  Had an order of Lumpia, which my mother, and my daughters enjoyed very much, including the peanut sauce.  I ordered the Shepherd's Pie. The mashed potato topping was delicious, and the carrots were perfectly tender. The meat was well seasoned, and very tender, and delicious. The portion size appeared to be on the smallish side, however, once I dug in, it became clear this would be a perfect amount of food.  My oldest daughter had the "Poppin' Chicken", chicken tenders, with a lovely light breading. The meat was tender, and not the least bit dry, which is very typical in fried chicken tenders.  My younger daughter had the "Cheesy Surprise", a sinfully cheesy macaroni dish.  My mother had the Grilled Sausage Platter. She claimed it was delicious, but I was not privileged enough to have sampled. :'(  My daughters each received a scoop of ice cream, for having completed the riddles on their menu. (And because they're adorable)  The musical talents of LuAnn and friends were a very pleasant addition to the evening, and the weather was gorgeous enough to sit on the patio. (My first patio experience)  I will be back, again, and again, and again....  P.S. I also refilled two growlers tonight; one Hoodoo Hefe, which I've not yet tried, and one Kaiserlich Dunkleweiss, which I thoroughly enjoyed the last time.

I went back to @NMTBrew tonight, because it's really that amazing.  Amy was our server. She quickly informed us that the guest brew, the Pumpkin Porter, was out, and that they had just that hour tapped the Mountain Stout.  I sampled it, as well as their Mild Child, a "succulent blonde".  The blonde was nice, but it's beginner beer.  The Stout, however, definitely for refined palettes.  Just had some crab dip for dinner.  Was very pleasantly surprised to have a visit from owner/brewmaster Rob, who came to discuss the Stout.  We discussed many different things, and I congratulated him on he, and Candy's success with their venture.  Sitting on the patio was initially a bit warm, but by the time we left, it was a nice night.  Can't get enough of this place!

We had a Groupon for the classic crust combination meal  We ordered the combo pizza, and tortellini alfredo  The pizza had a thin crust and ample toppings but not so much sauce that it overwhelms  The though the sauce was quite thick, the tortellini Alfredo was fantastic, topped with ribbons of shaved Parmesan  The combination meal also comes with zeppoli, which is a sort of Italian donut, to me reminiscent of the Native American fry bread  They're quite delicious, and I believe they would pair well with a nice Italian espresso  I would consider ordering from this establishment for delivery, but honestly, I'm not likely to return simply based on the location

They had a pulled pork sandwich special the day I was there  That was one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever enjoyed  Their fries are tasty, and not heavily greasy  They have a great patio, but my daughter was too chilly  They appeared to have a nice craft beer selection  They have peanuts avaliable for a snack, which is rare  I would absolutely return
