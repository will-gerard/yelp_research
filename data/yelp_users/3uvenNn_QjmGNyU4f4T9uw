Takes "sprawl" to a whole new level.  By the time we walked all the way to our "in terminal" rental car, I had lost 5 pounds.

We happened upon this place while we were in from out of town and didn't know any better. Man, did we luck out.  Grimaldi's reminds us that all chains are not inherently evil.  Hostess and bartender were both super nice, professional, and attentive.  We sat at the bar while we waited for our order, which we took to go.  Wine list was respectable, and they have a decent draft beer selection (a couple of standards, a couple of seasonals, a couple of locals...).  Pizza was outstanding - they have not forgotten their NY roots.  Delicious crust generously topped with pepperoni, onions, and shrooms.  In a word, fuhgedaboutit!  "Small" Mediterranean salad was really ample, though they could have been a tad more generous with the ingredients that make it Mediterranean.  Tasty dressing, obviously homemade.    All for a fair price.  We were pleasantly impressed and would go back if we ever find ourselves in Scottsdale again (which we kind of hope we do not).

Old Town Scottsdale - ten hundred tchotchke shops in a contrived wild west setting - all selling the same stuff.  Nothing unique or original. But we did get some great close-ups of a hummingbird hanging around one of the salvias planted along the street which saved this outing from being a complete and utter snoozefest.

for me, the difference between a 4-star place and a 5-star place is some extra something, some WOW factor.  at daily dose for us that bump came in the form of the service.  our server brooke was super attentive, and friendly, despite the fact that the place was packed - she made us feel like her only table.  she never seemed harried or rushed, despite taking care of so many, and made time for just the right amount of small talk in the midst of her professional and efficient service.  high five to brooke.  food was very good and reasonably priced.  I had the caprese grilled cheese, which was a unique take on two of my faves - grilled cheese and caprese salad.  and judging by my empty plate, it worked.  i chose a salad as my side and was grateful and duly impressed by the thought and creativity that they put into it - rather than most places that just throw some sad, lonely lettuce on a plate and call it a side salad.  one of my companions managed to finish "the gladiator" and mumbled "very good" right before he passed out.  other companion just had beer, but was impressed with the selection.  all in all, daily dose has it figured out.  they are a bright spot in the otherwise soul-less "old town" of scottsdale.  it is definitely worth the wait you will inevitably have - because the word is out!
