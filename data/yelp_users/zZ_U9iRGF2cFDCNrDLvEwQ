Just stopped in for free lunch for Veteran's Day. I had the 16th St Burger and Horseradish Mashed Potatoes. WOW! I sat at the bar. The service was awesome and everyone made a point to thank me for my service. Feeling proud after this visit.

I have been coming here for years. One of my favorite spots in Tempe. The food is always great. Today I had the Abe Froman Pizza, yum! My favorite server is Noelle, I try to sit in her section when I come because she always gives excellent service. Always earns a great tip.  Update: Just ran into an old friend, the staff was kind enough to relocate me to a bigger table without changing servers, even though the restaurant is busy.

I went to 2 Fry's stores today looking for 1 ingredient for Christmas Dinner. They close at 9:00 tonight so I had to hurry. I arrived at this store at 8:55 pm and they refused to let me in saying they were closed. They had a security guard standing outside denying entrance. I needed 1 item, arrived prior to the closing time and I was entrance.

I spoke too Steve today. I needed some last minute equipment prior to my next five trip. He was very helpful and knowledgeable. The prices are very reasonable even when compared to the internet discount dive shops. I will definitely go back.

Every good thing you've heard about this place is true. The staff is excellent and the beer is awesome. Try the Pizza it's the best.

Awesome as usual. The eggs Benedict is my favorite here. Eggs are always poached perfectly. Best Bloody Mary in Mesa.

I used to go to Minder Binders before they closed. I am equally impressed with the new opening. CHERI is an awesome bartender! The wings weren't the best, but Cheri more than made up for it.
