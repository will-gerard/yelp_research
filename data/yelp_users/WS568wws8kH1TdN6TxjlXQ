The food was just ok. Waste of food. They throw away what you can't finish. No take away. Drinks are not included in the $21.29 cost to binge eat. Helping America to stay one of the fattest countries.

The nachos were made with no care or consideration. Described as "piled high", but when they came out, they were maybe 2 or 3 layers of chips with all of the toppings just slopped on top. I ordered the shredded pollo and nothing about that chicken was shredded. There were 5-6 small bite size chunks. I know Mexican food can be easily made by pretty much anyone with any sense of taste or appreciation for Mexican food, but not this place. I've seen better things served at Del Taco. I wasn't expecting fine Mexican dining, but how do you get nachos wrong. Each bite and chip should have some cheese, at least. Chips, cheese, toppings, repeat for 2 more layers. It's not rocket surgery! This place should serve burgers and sandwiches and leave the Mexican food off of the menu. I'm willing to give them another shot, but this first experience was a total bummer.

The best ceviche mixto! The lomo saltado is always on point as well as the tallarin saltado. My favorite Peruvian spot in Phoenix.
