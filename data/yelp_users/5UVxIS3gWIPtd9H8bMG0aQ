Beer and wings! Great beer selection. Love this place. It doesn't try to be anything other than what it is. Sit at the bar, have a beer, and try some amazing wings. You won't be disappointed.

My boyfriend and I love Thai food. we have been to most Thai restaurants in the east valley. That being said, Thai paradise has the BEST Thai food we've ever had!! The place is small and tucked into a strip mall, but don't let that stop you! The owner/ server puts out some amazing food. Try the Pad See Ew, def my favorite!! Thai Paradise is a hidden gem!

I really wanted to like this place. It has really great reviews and I love supporting local small businesses. However... my boyfriend and I didn't have the best experience. When we first walked in, it was the cutest little cafe surrounded by a courtyard with wild birds chirping. It was so beautiful! So, we decided to sit outside. We went inside to get sat and the host asked us, two for lunch? It was 11:15 am on Saturday and we wanted breakfast. We tried to explain and the host went on to tell us that if we wanted breakfast she would have to talk to the cook, because she might've put everything away. But she might be able to make pancakes? None of this made any sense but we ended up taking a lunch menu and a breakfast menu. When she came out to take our order, she continued to ramble on about how they don't think they could do breakfast. We give up and we ordered lunch. we sit for about ten minutes and another table near us gets sat. I overhear them ordering breakfast which kind of irritated me. I let it go and still hold high hopes for this monte cristo I've heard such amazing things about. What feels like a while later, we finally get our food. It's nothing special. It's really just okay. My boyfriend had ordered and pastrami on rye and it was dry and overcooked and they didn't even put the sauce on it (that's why he ordered it), so we had to ask for it. Overall, we wouldn't go back. Maybe for breakfast... lol.

Honestly I wanted to like this place and with such high reviews, I thought I would. However, my mani was just okay. The design was a little sloppy I asked for and it didn't last long at all. Idk if I just had the new girl but it was not good. I don't think I will be back.

Amazing food and service! Loved the lemon blueberry pancake! So fluffy! Also tried the country Benedict- which was also delish! A must try for breakfast!

Beats out any of it's competition. The tortillas are made fresh- which makes a huge difference in the flavor. I've never had a bad experience at any of their locations. SO glad we decided to give it a try. Definitely have become a regular.  P.S.- that creamy cilantro dressing is so good- my husband and I have to get extra sides of it... which anything we order... try it :)

Really loved this place! Wanted some coffee after lunch at crust, so thought I would try this place out. Ended up with a chocolate croissant and dirty chai latte. Both were delicious! Croissant was soft and the chocolate was rich and creamy. Latte was perfect temperature and tasted like holidays in a cup! Cannot wait to go back and try more!

My husband I are big lovers of the original Thai chili in Gilbert, so when we saw this location open, we came immediately! Flavors are just as great as the original! Fast, delicious Thai food!
