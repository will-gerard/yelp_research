We have always enjoyed this cafe for brunch but they blew us out of the park tonight with a private party we had in their patio. They let us bring our decorations, helped us move tables around, and also allowed for split checks which is usually a pain to restaurants. I was worried about the traffic on 7th street being so loud but it wasn't even an issue- the patio had such a great atmosphere with the lights and the warmers. And the food was as always- AMAZING! The owners are from Maryland and they serve the best crab cakes in town- worth the visit! You won't be disappointed in this charming restaurant with quality food and service.

So now I know my worth to Ace.     I have always used this store as a super convenient Hardware store...,NEVER AGAIN!!!  I was returning air condition filters for a different size ... Simple right--- WRONG.   This exchange was not in their policy so they could not do it.  Sometimes a business manager needs to look past a store policy to retain a great client.  The filters probably cost them 2 bucks: compared to the hundreds of dollars that I have spent and  the hundreds that I would have spent in the future... I am glad to know that your appreciation of local clients is not worth 2 bucks.... ACE I am disappointed in you.
