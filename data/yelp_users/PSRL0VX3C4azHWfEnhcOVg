The selection was big but the quality of the food reminded me of a cafeteria. My cousin and I agreed that the food tasted as if it was sitting out for a while. The dessert section was an over load of cupcakes that were way too sweet. We would of been happier if there was a variety of sweets.

I haven't eaten at this restaurant in a few years and I'm glad that I decided to give it a shot again! All I can say is....OMFG, everything we ordered was making me drool while  I was chewing. DELICIOUS!!!

HUGE selection of Gel colors. I've never been so overwhelmed with choices. Dawn did my nails. I was pleased with her because she did a careful job and she knew I was on a time crunch so she worked as fast as she can to get me out of there. Convenient because it is down the street from our house in Vegas.

The service was decent. A small restaurant. This place is down the street from my boyfriend and I's house in Las Vegas so we decided to try it out. We both did the all you can eat menu. I liked the fact that you can order half sized orders of all the rolls. This gives you a chance to have variety. My boyfriend and I agreed that the texture of the rolls were boring and we would of liked there to be some sort of crunch rather than it being mushy. The quality and flavors were somewhat disappointing.

OMG! This place is amazing. I've dined at Raku about 10 times. Every dish is so passionately made by Japanese chefs from Tokyo. Every time I took a bite of any item I ordered it was so delicious, you would think that it is a delicacy. If you are not an open minded person with food, I wouldn't recommend eating here. Most of the dishes are unique. It's always a packed house, it doesn't help that the occupancy is only for 50.

I dropped in as a visitor with my boyfriend last Friday for the 9am class. Vili checked us in at the front and got us ready to go. He was also our trainer for the class. I loved that there was only 5 of us taking the class. 9am is pretty early for Las Vegas. The space was big, they also had a lot of equipment.   The WOD involved Tabata. It was a great work out, high intensity. Vili was a great trainer and coached me one on one when he had the chance. He was also encouraging towards everyone. Since my boyfriend and I have a house in Vegas we will definitely be back!

My man and I agree that this place is legit. The interior is swanky and modern. Lots of white and orange, with cool panels of micro suede fabric walls that are a bit plush.   The customer service is superb. The waiters take the time to have small conversations here and there. They check on you enough to not be annoying and interruptive.   I ordered the Jerk Fried Chicken with waffles. It was a generous portion. My man ordered the Mexican stew with eggs on top. We both had no complaints and pretty much devoured our plates. The only thing I wish was improved was the waffles. I like when the exterior is a bit crunchy. We liked that they brought out little complimentary fruit cups before our meal. The prices are very reasonable. We paid below 30 bucks!   We will definitely come back to test out their other menu options. Caribbean/American fusion. We appreciate unique menus.

Good Service, although I will never return because I ended up getting food poisoning and it ruined my whole Friday!

This place is down the street from our house in Vegas. We decided to grab a couple coffee drinks through the drive thru before our trip back to Irvine.  First of all the variety and wide span of selection is awesome. Every choice was unique, which I'm always a sucker for. I wanted to try everything! I got the "Dirty Chai Latte" hot which is Chai with a shot of espresso. Delicious! My Husband got a cold "Date Night" which is Strawberry Chocolate coffee. Very different, I dig it.

Okay, I can't get over how my taste buds were totally HAPPY about the food I ate here. It is one of the most memorable and best breakfasts that I have ever had! I got the Smoked Salmon Benedict...cream cheese Hollandaise, GENUIS!!!!! The Sweet Potato Pancakes with Caramel sauce, I mean c'mon this should be against the law. It is so delicious!!! Now I'm depressed thinking about how far away from home this place is. =(
