This has a super cool patio overlooking some of the larger building downtown, but also the fountains and trees of the area.  The crowd was a mixture of youth (high school) and families the night I visited. Our server was ok, but seemed annoyed when we asked for things. The flaming cheese was worth the other issues.  Nom Nom Nom.

Fast and efficient.  Stop by and they can usually get you in within about 10 to 15 minutes.  A polish change is $12 and that is similar to places outside the terminal.  You can grab a mani / pedi or get a Swedish or deep tissue massage.  Everyone is friendly and so far everyone has done a great job.   My nail tech took the time to go back and clean up all the edges before the top coat.... If you are stuck on a layover, what's better than a massage or quick polish change?

I have to admit that I only had charcuterie, mussels and cocktails on the patio here.  However, it was still a STRONG showing.  The patio has a great view in downtown near a lot of hotels, the staff was awesome and the only disappointing thing of the night was that they had run out of oysters... oh, tear!  The cocktails were also tasty and if I were this butcher... I would be arrogant too.. for good reason!   I would absolutely come back here again and would love to try a main course!
