I hate to be a downer....  My dear friend and I came in after our mid morning trip to the gym hoping to get some coffee and a light bite.  I settled on the Organic yogurt and granola and a protein shake after asking a few questions about the granola (I don't like oily granola) and inquiring about the brand of protein powder used. I didn't feel like my questions were answered very well but I was hungry and it was crunch time. My friend got a vanilla latte and a tuna sandwich....we sat down....  I watch the guy begin to make my protein shake....The container for the Protein read Smart Gainer http://www.nextag.com/ids-smart-gainer/search-html 600 calories and counting.  read it for yourself...make since for a weight lifter or a very skinny person trying to gain weight....but I just came from the gym and worked really hard to run off those damn calories. I do not want my protein shake to be a weight gainer....I want in to be what it say it is...simple protein shake.....anyway I watched them make my granola as well...not Organic like they said. I think its important to use what you say you are using...they were using yoplait. Not organic. Humph.  On the other hand the tuna sand was pretty good....props on the sandwich but I'm not coming back anytime soon.

Tom Bachner, the GM is a massive asshole. Normally I would not say this on a public website, but after talking to him on the phone, he was a total prick and offered no assistance or help of any kind...I was just trying to figure out why I was charged 79.00 dollars instead of $20.00. My friends had a really bad meal as well and one got sick within an hour of eating there. The food, I have to say was horrible, the service was extremely bad. Seriously...Pull it together. Skip this restaurant on your next Vegas trip. Zero customer service skills.

The only reason I'm changing my review is for the best waiter ever. Seriously. I have never had service in Arizona as good as his. John is an amazing waiter who clearly takes pride in his work. This to me is hard to come by. When you get good service it just makes everything taste better :)  My mom and I are very picky eaters...no oils, no dairy, no wheat or gluten. He was very understanding and didn't make us feel like changing around the menu was a bother (it has to be). He was on top of everything. Anticipated every want or need.   If you eat here, ask to sit in Johns section. It will be a great experience!

Don't order take out. There portions are so small. I was really disappointed. My chicken was literally raw inside, the service was crap, they forgot my dressing. All I ordered was sides and a piece of grilled chicken. Simple enough...I thought. Stick to the other location till they get all there kinks worked out.   The Biltmore location is much more laid back and not nearly as trendy and wannabe hollywood.  The waitstaff is much more together and the portions are consistent. Im staying with that location.
