Service? I think NOT.  Have been here on many a drunk night and it seems as though they have traded in the nice bar staff and they recieved a crabby jerk instead!  Though I think you might expect a little crabbiness from a place like this (dive bar, homemade games, icky bathrooms, etc.) the guy on this past Sunday was over the top.  After asking if they had Skyy brand of vodka the guy game me a look as though I was ordering a fruit smoothie blended drink and then kept the look on his face for the next 45 minutes we were there.  If you aren't happy being a bartender... find a NEW job! The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because in an attempt to escape the bartender we went out to the patio and had fun playing Jenga!

Took in my old laptop that had crashed and they were very honest in telling me it would be better for me just to purchase something new.  Thas is right! They turned down the "repair" job and gave me some great advice!  THANKS!

Have you tried the "BUZZ BERRY CHAI"? By far the BEST drink here.  Love having this local gem close by and the addition of the drive thru makes it perfect!

This service was great!  I left a message and Steve called right back and made the appointment, he called a few days before to confirm and then again to let me know he was on the way.  He showed up right on time and did a great job.  My carpets look beautiful again and he explained everything before he started which I liked.  The price was exactly what he quoted (no tricky up-charges) and he even killed a scorpion that was on my carpet! Would definitely recommend Steve and Carpet MD!

Easy to find, plenty of parking on the street mid-day, online appointment scheduling and "paperwork", a GRRRREAAT! adjustment AND only $25~??? Nothing could have made this experience any better.  I highly recommend it!

Had another great experience with Dr. Troy! Super easy to get to when you need a mid-day appointment!
