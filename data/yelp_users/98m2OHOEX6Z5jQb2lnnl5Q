All right.  It's come-to-Jesus time.  It's hard to watch a thriving business implode, but that's what is happening here.  I've been a regular at this Teakwoods for about 7 years now.  My husband and I liked the atmosphere, food and friendliness so much that it's safe to say we even considered this when we bought our house (within walking distance) back in 2007.  Everyone who worked there was welcoming and hard-working, from the bartenders to the servers to the bussers.  The wings (and other dishes) were great (especially as sports-bar food goes), beer selection was good, prices were reasonable.  We've seen staff (and management) come and go, but we've remained loyal, and actually have stayed good friends with many current and ex-employees, who have become like family to us.  But things have been steadily going downhill, and now I think they've nearly reached rock bottom.    It started with cosmetic stuff.  Leaky ceilings, scruffy empty shelves behind the bar for a long time, mismatched and shabby (and some downright uncomfortable) furnishings, tatty bathrooms.  Then, the food.  We used to look forward to the daily specials; now it seems management is finding ways to "repurpose" leftovers or overstocks in new and unappealing ways and, frankly, in weird combinations.  Sliced hot dogs on a lavosh? Really?  Even one of my previously favorite appetizers, the caprese (oh--now spelled "caprice" on the menu) tastes bland and worn out.  I used to LOVE the creamy, cheesy, meaty cheeseburger soup when it appeared on the menu, but I had it just a couple of days ago and was disappointed to find it watery, virtually tasteless, and sorely lacking in the meat department.  Prices were raised (during the recent Arizona Beer Week; talk about opportunistic!), and a rash of regulars left in protest, and have stayed away.  But I and a dozen or so other regulars remained, largely because of the friendly and efficient service of a few remaining long-time servers there, along with a few awesome bartenders and wonderful bussers.  The service in general had also gone down over time, but management seems to want to drive it right into the dirt, as they decided this week to get rid of two of their best servers.  That was the last straw for pretty much all of the regulars who had remained.  I feel like I'm going through a divorce.  It's sad and depressing to watch, slowly but surely, a decent business and a fun place run into the ground (going much the same direction, apparently, as the recently closed Maricopa and Phoenix locations of Teakwoods have gone) by bad management and poor decisions, who put "profits" over people.  Why did I even give this place TWO stars? For the handful of wonderful staff who remain--AND for the wings, which are still great.  But if you MUST have them, I'd advise you to get them to go!

I have been to several chiropractors over the years and, frankly, was never too impressed with their "move 'em in, move 'em out" mentality.  Dr. Mike Martin is SO far away from that; he really knows his stuff, combines massage with manipulation...I've NEVER walked away from here without feeling anything but amazing.  HIGHLY recommended, especially for those who have their doubts about chiropractors!

It appears from reading the other reviews here that this place hasn't changed for the better.  These people are CROOKS, and any condo complex/HOA who hires them needs to have their heads examined.  We have been going to an annual holiday dinner at a family member's home, in a gated condo complex, for YEARS, always parking in the same spot immediately in front of the home.  This year, when two visiting couples (myself and my husband were one of them) came out of the house to drive home--no cars! We called the police to see if they were stolen, as there were no "no parking" signs, no red curbs, no warnings, nothing.  The police told us they had been towed (only 10 minutes before we came out!) by this "business" (and I use that term loosely).  When we called THEIR number, we reached a voice mail.  Eventually they phoned us back, only after the police had informed them that we had personal property in the cars, including prescription medications that were urgently needed.  They reluctantly agreed to let us go get the cars at the impound lot (although it was "highly against policy")---provided we paid $300 cash for EACH car.  The impound lot was only two miles from the home we were at.  This was no more than a money-making scheme and highway robbery!!!

I can't recommend Brenda highly enough! We started using her to look after our 3 dogs (and now also 1 cat) last year, and we have been SO impressed with her level of care and communication! Her prices are quite reasonable, and it is so nice to know our pets can just stay in our home, where they are comfortable, and have someone come visit, feed them, and play with them.  Brenda always sends texts messages (often with photos!) of the animals to "say Hi", and we now can go away with confidence knowing the furry members of our family are well looked after!

There is really nothing not to like here! Great homemade pastas (ask about the pasta tasting menu!), wonderful pizzas, appetizers...a phenomenal charcuterie board...oh, and the "crack" known as the chef's focaccia (not on menu...you need to ask)...an unbelievable thin bread stuffed with mascarpone/ricotta cheese and drizzled with honey...OMG. Crispy chicken thigh is also outstanding. Fantastic happy hour from 4-7 pm. Get here now.
