Love this family owned Italian deli.  They are the cooks and that staff, and they always remember your name, even when you have not been their in years.  Love the photos of the senior classes from Saguaro High School, definitely supports the locals.  Get the chicken salad sandwich or the chicken steak, you will not be disappointed.

This venue is perfect for small productions and great acting.  I have been to several shows, and they rarely disappoint.

If you use Discount Tire once, you will never go to another tire shop...they are just that good.

The Manager Bill, Phil and Adam did an amazing job taking care of my 2007 Toyota FJ. I had some issues with tire sizing with the wheels I had, and they went above and beyond to make me a satisfied customer.

Had to move it up to five stars. These people are great for large orders for those office breakfast meetings and helps to call it in before. Great Bagels, and have been around for a long time.  Same owners, and consistent good food.

I have been coming here since I was a baby...so for 46 years, and it rarely disappoints.  I find the larger the steak, the better the cut and taste, so order a big one and share.

Pretty good bagels for Arizona.  Definitely remind me of New York bagels.

Dinner with four Hall of Famers sitting around me...Nolan Ryan, George Brett, Joe Morgan and Ken Griffey Sr., not bad, but the food was really good.  A nice surprise on the West Side!

Chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good. Service was OK.

My favorite neighborhood restaurant. Food is awesome and the staff is very friendly. Green Chili Pork and the Big Ass Burger are amazing with a Goose Island Belgian Style Ale.

I was disappointed when they gave me the sale price for my return on a known defective item that they put on sale since it was defective (Wallflower Night Light).  In these cases when it is known to be defective, they should exchange at full price.

My girlfriend won $15K in Pei Gow poker there, so we love the place and hope the luck continues.

Sadly, I have to put in a negative for my most recent experience at my favorite bar in Old Town.  I was excited to share my favorite hang out with my cousins in from Illinois, for dinner before St. Patrick's Day festivities.  The bouncer said he could not let any more patrons in since they didn't have enough staff to cover all the tables.  Half of the tables were EMPTY!!!    The manager came out and said they were short staffed, some people didn't come in and we would have to wait about 30 minutes, or until enough people left.  I can certainly understand the predicament, however this manager was unapologetic.  I convinced my cousins to come back later for a night cap and some appetizers, and the same manager delivered our food and said, "I see you cam back!"  Again, no apology for the situation, and didn't even offer a free drink or appetizer for our inconvenience.    I love this place, and will come back based on my past experiences, but the manager needs serious customer experience training, because my cousins said they will never go back based on this bad experience.

So, I went here because it had four and a half stars on Yelp. Would have never found this place on my own as it is tucked on a side street along the runway of the Scottsdale airport.  The food did not disappoint.  The bread was average, but the dipping sauce made up for it.  The only reason it did not get five stars is that it's wine selection is pretty limited.  Service was great, perfect for families.

Good burgers and good Bloody Mary's with bacon.  Everything is better with bacon, even the vodka was infused with bacon fat.

Grilled Chicken Cesar not up to par as in the past. Croutons were burnt and chicken was dry.

It is a typical airport Starbucks.  They really need to be more efficient when people are needing a bite to eat and coffee before they board their flight.

Moscow Mules and the scallops were amazing, while their chopped salad was bigger and just as good as Cowboy Chio's.

Their cheese grits are the best grits I have ever had...and this is in Arizona!!!  Fresh squeezed orange juice and flavorful dishes, makes Butters, my favorite breakfast place.

Really good Mexican food.  I recommend the guacamole and the green chili burro.  Margaritas were OK, but nothing special.

Food was good but the service was poor. The waiter was out of sync with the support staff and we had to ask for everything and in some cases twice. Diet coke refill never arrived.

Wonderful wood fired pizza. The Cremini mushrooms are wonderful on the sausage pizza. This little hole in the wall pizza joint is worth searching for, just east of Handlebar J's.  They even have a portable wood fire pizza oven for catering.

Great atmosphere, eclectic menu, great service at a fair price.  Everything I like in a restaurant.  The goat cheese fritters were amazing, but need to ask for more bread if you order.  The crispy thighs were good, but looking forward to ordering more items off their varied menu.
