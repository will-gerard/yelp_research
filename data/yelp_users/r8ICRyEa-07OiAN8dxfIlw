I was in this location the other day shopping with my daughter.  We see another customer that has a disability that causes her difficulties walking.  I then see a couple of employees that were stocking and what appeared to be maybe a team lead or asst manager making fun of the customer. Imitating her walk, laughing and having a good ole time.  I was so unbelievably shocked, how do you explain that to a child.  The unprofessionalism astounds me.

I shop at this Lowes location regularly.  I have had 2 seperate amazing customer service experiences.  First, I was shopping for door knobs for my new home.  If anyone has shopped for door knobs you know that there are alot of options, shapes, colors, prices etc.  I do not remember the associates name but she was so helpful and personable.  I liked the ability to change my locks on my own but was somewhat scared of the safety of it.  She was very on top of her product knowledge and was very helpful.  She even remembered me a couple weeks later and asked me how my install went.  Second, I was shopping for a new bathroom countertop.  I had choose the one that I wanted and an associate came to make sure that I didn't have any questions etc.  I told him that I had made my choice.  He helped me get it off the shelf and even took it upon himself to open the box and make sure that it was damage free.  I honestly would not have thought to do that on my own.  We inspected it, taped it up... he walked me up to the check out, loaded it in my truck.  Very nice man again I wish I remembered his name.  All of the associates at the Thunderbird location are always helpful and kind.

We have been going to this Denny's for 3-4 years now.  My spouse and I have breakfast with our very close friend on Sunday's often.  Our daughter and I go there sometimes on Friday's before school as well as special treat.  Very friendly staff, I cannot remember ever having bad service.  A lot of the servers have been there for the whole time we have been going there.  A lot of them know us.  Very nice people.  It is still Denny's so of course it's not 5 star dining but the service is great!

You can't really go wrong with Valle Luna.  I have been going there for years, used to go to the East valley location every week when I lived on that side of town.  Good food, good price!

Well, we attempted to try out the Main Ingredient after being referred by a friend, only to have an amazingly long wait and to be greeted by one of the rudest people I have ever met in my life. Needless to say they do not deserve our business or yours. There are a lot more local places that appreciate you and your business, give them your money.

Very good food at a good price. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I didn't like the tables much but other than that it was excellent.
