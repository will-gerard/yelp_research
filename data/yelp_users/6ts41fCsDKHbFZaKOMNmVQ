The fam and I headed on down to Honey Bears this past Saturday to get our BBQ on!   Honey Bears never disappoints!   I had the shredded BBQ chicken sandwich with a side of the cowboy beans, sooo spicy and delicious!   Also their french fries may be sent from heaven! SO GOOD!   I always go for the Big Red at the soda machine, that is a rare soda to find on tap and Honey Bears has it!   Thanks for another tasty lunch!

I always enjoy a good trip to the zoo!   I took a few days off work because my aunt was in town and she had never been to the PHX zoo! My sister is a member and had an extra pass so that was cool, but to avoid paying all together we swooped by a library on the way to the zoo and picked up one of those FREE cultural passes so we all got in for free.   We arrived just after 10 and it was already in the high 90's. SO HOT. The zoo was pretty vacant as it was hot as all get out and it was a Monday.   We got to see all of the animals though some were sleeping in the shade, but who could blame them.   My one complaint is that NONE of the little stands along the paths were open to buy bottled water or frozen treats. Sure there were vending machines but we had to walk all the way back to the front to grab waters.   The little water park areas along the way are rad. We stopped and my niece played in the water for a good 30 minutes and got cooled down.   Also my favorite part is Monkey Village! You get to actually go in and hang out with the monkeys! They were being so crazy and jumping over our heads and even got down on the ground and were just meer feet away! Such a great time!   For sure go when it gets cooler but be prepared to fight the crowds.

Little shout out to Lori and the floral department staff.   I needed some special order flowers that were in season but not a common item any store carried. I called and spoke to Lori and she told me that she could get them in for me.  The day I picked them  up a very nice girl in the floral dept. helped me out. The flowers were amazing! I will for sure be going back here for floral needs!

Oh Cheese N' Stuff how I love thee!   I didn't know of The Cheese until I started dating my now husband. He has been going here since he was a little boy. His whole family is obsessed with this place, to the point that not only does the owner know them by heart and knows what they order, but so does the owners kids! That's customer service!   I usually get the tuna, its AMAZING but this past Saturday I went for the #5 which is the turkey sammich on a sub roll with Russian dressing! So yum!    Also, I am wayyyyyy picky about my macaroni salad, and cNs's mac salad is the bomb nonnie! I promise!   I topped off my lunch with a cream soda!   Yes its old and cramped, but the sandwiches make up for all of that.

Ive been going here over the years.   The food is always spot on. I can't think of a visit where I left dissatisfied.   I love that I can order Italian or Asian or a little bit of both.   Last night I ordered the Orange Zest chicken and hubs got the seafood Au gratin. Both were fresh and very tasty. We also had the spicy shrimp lettuce wraps to start.They are spicy but have a great flavor.   I must echo the other reviewers about the service. GOOD LORD. Seriously slowest.service.ever. Last night we waited a good 15 minutes for our server to come back with the bill and the hubs credit card. Not cool. We've decided that when we go next time to ask for our bill the second our food comes out.

I went to I Do I Do because it was right down the street from my house. I had already purchased my wedding gown but still needed Bridesmaid dresses and Tuxes for the guys.  Our original sales girl was great and very helpful. I had 9 girls in my party so dress shopping was a bit hecktic. I took 4 with me the first time, 2 had to make their own appointments and then I took the last 3 in...so I tried to make it as easy as possible. The store hours they keep are almost next to impossible to shop around, because twice they told me they didnt ALLOW bridesmaid dress shopping on satrudays...What business doesnt let customers come in to shop and GIVE THEM MONEY? Thats where all of our issues started  The assistant Mgr was the nasty girl ever. She made my bridesmaids feel unwelcome and she was very rude to me. The owner of the shop finally stepped in adn after that it was smooth sailing.   DO NOT use the alterations person they recomend that is next door to them, they botched one of te girls dresses so badly it was almost unwearable!   We did get the guys tuxes through I do I do which carries the Jims Formalwear Line. The guys tuxes looked soooo good! We had only a slight issue with one of them not fitting and it was fixed asap!   They do have a good selection. They just need better staffing.

The portions you get at Ajo Als are crazy town! I ordered a taco and a tamale for lunch and I have never seen a tamale that gigantic before! Both were super tasty and I would for sure order them again!   The chips and salsa are good. The service was a wee bit slow, we went on a Sunday afternoon and there weren't many people there.

The Hubs and his mom and dad andI all went here on Saturday night. Its walking distance from their house and we go here a few times a year.  I like going on Fridays much better because they have a great fried fish that is only unfortunatly sold on Fridays :( This time around I ordered the chopped steak, it was pretty decent, its loaded with lots of grilled onions. I love the mashed potatos and the side salads come with tons of chopped up green olives, which anything involving green olives gets a plus in my book!   My mother in law got the catfish, I snuk a bite and it was pretty good. Not fisy at all. The hubs got the tbone. He asked for it medium, but it came out on the very rare side. He ate it anyway and said it was good.   I love that they have Shiner Bock here. That is up on my list of favorite beers!

Phoenix City Grille is A OK in my book! Great food and service!   We were here last Friday, it was my father in laws 60th bday celebration, there were about 20-25 of us. And yes we had reservations! They actually have a private room for large parties! Super Sweet!   We only had one waitress, but it seemed that we were her only table while we were there. She was pretty on top of things, my wine glass never hit empty. She took our orders and I was surprised at how fast the food came out, very impressive.   I ordered the Tilapia, it had an almond (I think) crust with a raspberry sauce served over roasted veggies. The tilapia was amazing and so were the veggies, though the veggie portion was very small, one more small scoop wont break the bank PCG!   Its a cozy and dark/romantic type setting.

Once we were seated our wiatress was quick to take our drink order.   I ordered the griddled corn cakes and that has all I have thoguht about since taking my last bite. They were beyond amazing!   I have never been here for brunch before but think I will need to go back very soon! Such a great brunch to honor an awesome mother in law!

Only go to the Swizzle Inn if you like good times. If you do not like to have good times then no Swizzle Inn for you!   The hubs and I used to live with in crawling distance of the Swizz, loved how close we were. Now we live about a $15 cab ride away :(   We hit up the Swizz this past Saturday, it had been a while since I had been there. And boy did I miss it. The crowd is always a nice random mix of people. The bartender is always on the ball and the wait for a drink isn't long at all.   I do wish their tap selection was a bit better/broader...but whatev. This place has an indoor atrium of an ocean scene so it can do whatever the hell it wants!   The jukebox has rad tunes! The pool table is always hoppen. Only go here if you like good times.

We hit up the Rokerij on Friday night for an early bday celebration for the hubs! Sooo glad I made reservations, the line to be seated stayed strong the whole time we were there, one group would get seated as another entered the building, the places was jam packed!   Our waiter, Clark was ON IT all night! He was a great waiter and went above and beyond!   The food was pretty decent. I ordered the Rokerij burger medium well, but it came out on the medium/medium rare tip...But I dealt and ate it. I had a side of the roasted beets which were pretty fantastic.   We ordered a couple apps, calamari, onion rings and prime rib and brie cheese toasts...all were delicious!

I Loooooooove being a Yelp Elite!!!!  We seriously get the red carpet rolled out for us!   The Capital Grille and its staff went above and beyond!!! One waiter in particular really stuck out, John was so knowledgeable, friendly and just fun to talk to,   THE FOOD!!!!!! OMG! I have been to this location before for dinner! Love their french onion soup!  The lunch plates are just terrific! I loved the crab cake slider and those french fries, oh my!  I could have drank a gallon of the roasted red pepper soup!   I may or may not have eaten three coconut cream pies! I have never had one that delicious before!   The rotating Yelp ice sculpture was a nice touch! So fancy!   I enjoyed getting schooled on the different cuts of meat. So informative!   Thanks so much to Lindsey, Yelp, and the Capital Grille for hosting such an amazing and memorable event!

The Wrigley Mansion holds a spot in my heart already (its where the husband first told me he loved me, so romantic)   This place is top notch and extremely impressive whether you are having lunch or just drinks.   My aunt is visiting from out of town and I really wanted to give her a good time. I had mentioned that we should try to get reservations at the Wrigley and her eyes lit up! As it turns out, in the 30 years she has been coming to visit no one has ever taken her there! I called and was able to get a lunch reservation for the very next day!   Everyone there is so friendly, from the valet to the hostess to the waiters and staff. Our lunch was AMAZING! I had the french onion soup and grilled veggie panini, soooooooooo tasty!   After wards we roamed the halls and learned some cool facts about The mansion!   This place is fantastic! If you want to impress a date, take them here for dinner! If you want to have a fabulous lunch (and let me note, not pricey at all, for 3 of us our bill was just barely over $40!!!) GO HERE!

Loooooooooooove me some Houston's!   The hubs and I really dig this place, also whenever out of town family comes in, Houston's is always our first stop on the laundry list of places to hit up.   We always start off with the artichoke dip. Freaken HEAVEN!   The hubs usually gets the Hawaiian rib eye    My usual tends to be the Grilled Chicken Salad, they put this amazing dressing on it that is phenomenal! Also, I generally order my salad with a side of fries, because 1. they are the most amazing fries I have ever had in my life and 2. I am a fat kid and fat kids love french fries. End of story.   One things that i think Houston's could improve on is their dessert selection, its kinda weak. Delicious, but weak. I love dessert and Houston's dessert list does not fulfill my fatty needs. But that's ok, I will live.   The wait staff is always on point! They are always knowledgeable of what the daily specials are and super friendly.   Also they now offer complimentary valet parking, SCORE!

Houston's has always been the "go to" restaurant for my in-laws. Whenever anyone is visiting from out of town we go to Houston's for a nice casual dinner.   We were a little sad when they told us they were closing, but excited that they were building a brand new building just down the road.   Last night the Hubs, mother in law and I decided to hit up Houston's. We pulled up to the valet and no one was there, we look and Houston's is gone. Then we looked and noticed the Hillstone sign was lit.   The hubs and MIL didn't believe me that Hillstone and Houston's were the same company. But they are! Woot!   The new building is AMAZING! I loved the patio, though they will only serve apps and drinks out there, they wont let you have dinner out there which is to bad considering last night was perfect out door dinning weather.   The new building has that same Houston's vibe, only its way bigger! It now features two bars AND a sushi bar!   The food is still the same and still just as amazing as it always is!   One note of complaint however. The old Houston's used to offer a Riesling by the glass, now its only by the bottle, which is a total bummer because that's all my MIL will drink.   We really had a great experience as we always do with this company.

We went here for dinner this past Saturday for Restaurant week.   Its a cute little place with lots of little rooms. The decor is a little old and boring.   The food and service was pretty great.   The lack of music was deadening. There was zero atmosphere here.   The little basket of bread they brought out was decent though the mini croissants were very very chewy and a bit burnt.   I ordered the Baked brie puff pastry with fig sauce, freaken YUM!  We also ordered the beet and goat cheese salad off the regular menu to share, it was really good but the price for the portion is a total joke!   For dinner I ordered the bean ravioli, it was just ok.   For dessert I got the flourless chocolate cake, it was really dry, not sure if that's how its supposed to be. The husband ordered the pecan pie, I snuck a bite and it was amazing!   We had a really great time but I wasn't floored or wowed and glad I didn't have to pay the regular prices as they were very high.

I really don't know what I could say to really give this place the review it deserves!   T. Cooks was OUTSTANDING and above my expectations!!!!   Hubs and I went here this past Monday for our 2 year wedding anniversary! We had never been and I had been wanting to try it out.   We were shown to our table and they had rose petals scattered around, nice touch.   Our waiter Dan was great. Full of knowledge about the wine selection and very personable.   We started with crab cakes, I don't really eat crab, But I finished it off, so good! I loved the crispness of the out side of the cake and the sweet corn sauce it was placed upon.   Next up was soup. Hubs got the lobster bisque and I got the nights special which was a cauliflower puree and cheese soup. AMAZING! I love that they bring the bowl out empty (well there is fun little accompaniments in there) and then pour the soup right there, very fancy.   Out came the entrees. Hubs had the prime rib and I had the Dover sole. The fish was cooked perfectly. We ate until we were in a food coma.   But that's not all, as it turns out a friend of ours waiters there, he wasn't working that night but called and told them it was our anniversary, hence the flowers on our table, as we did not tell them when we made reservations. They brought out a dessert platter on the house! It had about four different desserts on it and all were decadent!   We really had a great time here and cant wait to go back!

Even in the chaos, the LGO always comes through!   I've never had anything but the french pancakes with EVERYTHING on them! So yummy, though I noticed the last couple times I have gone in they have gotten a bit stingy with the creme, honey and fruit...for the price, pile a tiny bit more on please :)   The hubs usually gets the commuter sandwich and never has any complaints. They have great OJ and iced tea!   I've never gone here to shop, I've only bought MJ potato rolls from here during the holidays, it was first come first served and I was told they would start selling them at 9 a.m. so there I was promptly at 9. When I asked the girl who was standing around handing out menus where I could find the rolls, she was clueless. She tried to give me English muffins. I told her again that I was looking for the MJ/tammie Coe dinner rolls. I get a blank stair. Then the hubs spies them in the corner behind the cheese case and just went back there and grabbed 2 dozen for us. Those rolls are a huge hit with our family!   The parking is a big fat fail.   Its a fun place, great atmosphere and tasty breakfasts!   Their pizza's are pretty fabulous as well!

I went here last night. I was SOOOO excited to FINALLY go to The Chicago Hamburger Co.. I have been driving past that place ever since I was little, but never got to go in.   Well last night was the night. The hubs and his friend Josh have both gone a few times and rave about how awesome it is. I HAD to go!   Well....It wasn't what I expected. I will give them that the service was friendly and we had our food in about 10-15 minutes. They were pretty busy, but it came quick.   I got two double meat cheese sliders. I was only able to choke down one. The meat was not good at all, it tasted sour. The buns were really mushy. The grilled onions tasted like they had been made days ago and warmed back up. I pawned off my other burger on the hubs.   We all split a couple other things because I wanted to try it all.   The cheese fries....GROSS. They were soggy...like the fries tasted soggy before the cheese was ever put on. And the cheese had ZERO flavor, I wanted to dump salt and pepper all over it to give it some sort of flavor. anything.   The Frito Pie...Now I was way stoked that they had Frito pie on the menu. There used to be this hot dog cart in this industrial area that had bomb Frito pies and I hadn't had one in about 7 years. Well, the chili was disgusting. In all my life I have never had chili like the Chicago Hamburger Co. It tasted like a bag of sugar accidentally got knocked over into the chili as they were making it and they just let it ride. So so sweet...so un edible.   The Onion Rings...They were good. Nice and crisp. Really thin though and the batter they use isn't very special at all. But I would eat them again and be happy.   Over all....Its mediocre. I would never ask to go back, but if the hubs really wanted to go there for sliders again, I would go and try something different. They have a turkey burger which sounds good.   Sorry Chicago Hamburger Co I really really wanted to like you.

I like Pat's Pizza Plus!   Its not the best pizza I have ever had, but its not the worst either. Its just right there in the middle good pizza.   The crust is always perfect, that sauce is always delightful. I like to eat in and get a small side salad (while the salad is a bit lacking you get these glorious little rolls made from heaven)   Like one yelp-er said, all the off putting signs are a bit much, but I have also witnessed the type of clientele that go in there and have been tempted a few times to bitch slap someone for their oblivious rudeness to the employees of Pat's.

I am sooooooooooooo glad my sister referred me to this place.   She has a special needs dog and takes her here and the staff there is always good to her dog. So when I was freaking out about finding a good place to board my dog Ladmo, she suggested Sherry's.   I've boarded Ladmo at the vet before and they did a fine job, but there he had to be in a cage and only got to come out like 3 times a day. If it was one night, then maybe, but we were going to be gone for 3 nights and I couldn't stand to think about him in a cage.   So I looked up Sherry's, no reviews on here which is a shame. But I took a risk, knowing my sister uses this place and her dog always comes back alive and in good shape was enough for me to take the leap.   Sherry's charged the same price as my vet, but for $25 a day at Sherry's Ladmo got his own ROOM! A 4 foot by 8 foot space all to himself versus a small cage/kennel. Also Ladmo got to play with all the other dogs his size in the indoor play area and got to go outside every hour for breaks in the covered misted outdoor area.   He seemed to have had a blast. I was able to have fun on my vacation and not worry about him being locked up. I will FOR SURE WITH OUT A DOUBT be taking Ladmo back here for any boarding needs. They do grooming as well but he is in love with his groomer at Petsmart so we will keep going there, but I may enroll him in daycare ($15 for 12 hours) just so he can go and be social with other dogs. Heck maybe the other dogs will teach him how pooping on the floor is bad, hopefully he runs with a good pack of pups.

Ladmo gives Sherry's a 5 paw review!   Still loving me some Sherry's!   We were having our roof replaced this past week and didn't want to leave our little pup Ladmo home all day to be scared and stressed out by all the banging on the roof.   So off to Sherry's he went. Each morning I would drop him off and pick him up on my way home from work.   He was soooo chill and relaxed (he is normally a hyper dog) he got to play with other dogs all day long, I can tell he had a blast!   On his last day I had them give him a bath, he is so nice and fluffy!   I also found out they charge a whole heck of a lot less for grooming then where we usually go. So we may pay a visit for grooming.

I walked in this morning. There are 2 employees standing at the counter. NEITHER looks up to even say hello to me. (Although, as what looked to be the morning shift was arriving over the course of the 15 minutes I was there, they said good morning to everyone who worked with them that walked through the door)   This place is a "print center" and they could not print on simple card stock that my regular home printer can print on. So lame. The card stock kept jamming so they wouldn't print anymore for me, even though it was printing them beautifully, they were just jamming when they were coming out so they had to keep opening the machine.   At any rate, 1 star because for being a print center they should be able to PRINT.

I have been going here for a good 10 years (followed them from their old location)   The girls up front are always so friendly and even though I only see them once a year they know my name and genuinely seem happy to see me. Rosey is so nice!   The nurses are nice enough from the interaction Ive had with them.   I generally see Gretchen and she is AMAZING! She is like the cool aunt you love to go shopping with! She answers all questions thoroughly and really makes the whole experience as easy as possible.   Great office! I recommend them to anyone who asks!

I am sad to see all the negative reviews....though it seems that a good majority is for the sushi, which, I do not eat.   I am pretty much IN LOVE with the Chicken Katsu here. I order it with a side of teriyaki (I like to dip my chicken Katsu in the teriyaki sauce, then the Katsu sauce for a sweet and savory flavor)   The Tempura is always great, we get a mixed starter.   The miso is tasty.   I love the little salad they serve with the peanut dressing, its the first thing I eat off my plate. So good!   I didn't give them 5 stars because this last time we went (Tuesday night) our waitress was a total space Cadette. She looked like she was barely old enough to work. Had zero personality. Just wasn't feeling her at all.   Other then that, this is one of my go to spots when I have a deep need for some Chicken Katsu. I have had this dish at other restaurants and none come close to Shoguns.

Still giving them a 4 for the food. It is ALWAYS amazing. However the service is at a TWO :(  the service is getting worse and worse by the visit :(  A few weeks ago me and a few girlfriends went on a Friday night. Yes they were super busy but our waiter may have been the worst waiter I have ever encountered anywhere. Ever.   Drinks were messed up. Drinks would take a solid 20 minutes to com if they came at all. Everybody's food came out great but when the bill came he had billed us for a few extra things. At one point he was not comprehending that 2 + 1 = 3 and not FOUR. Good grief!   We had the manager at our table several times. He did take care of us and made things right. But dang.   I reallllly hope they get their act together. I love eating here but really can not take one more bad service from them.

After going to a few different wedding dress shops in the city I decided to stop into Azteca on a whim. They were accomodating even though I didnt have an appointment.  I tried on about 7 dresses. The girls there are helpful, but there are some language barrier issues...So thats why i gave it 4 stars.   I ended up purchasing an Allure Couture gown off the rack,  they had some crazy sale going and since I bought the sample gown I only paid $300 for the $1300 gown! AND it fit like a glove, only needed to have the bustle sewn in!

I took a couple days off last month to hang with my sister and her babies (ages 2 and 3 weeks).   We wanted to do something fun with the 2 year old but indoors as its been hot out. We got to As You Wish at 10 am right opened and they were JAM PACKED! Apparently they have classes and class wasn't out yet. At first they were a bit snotty and asked if we had a reservation, when we told them we didn't they took down our name and number and said they would call us when a table was free.   About 20 minutes later they called and were ready for us. We had no clue that a Monday morning at a Pottery place would be the happening place.   For $28 my niece painted a ceramic puppy. The cost to paint was only $8 but the price of the pieces they have to paint there are way over priced.   My niece had fun and she loves her green and purple puppy.

Fast Eddies is your typical diner!   Great fast food, great service, low prices!   I am a big fan of their patty melt, and I love the crinkle cut fries!   We've gone for breakfast, lunch and dinner and haven't had any bad experiences yet.   The decor is lacking, and scary and I feel like I am on the tilt-a-whirl but other then that, Eddies is good if you just want a good bite to eat with out any fuss.

Have I mentioned I wish I could go here every day?   The hubs, Mother in law and I all headed over to the Lamar on Saturday afternoon for some massages. Even though the place was wayyyy busier then I have ever seen it, we did not have to wait for our appointments.   Everyone enjoyed their massages and we hung around and took advantage of the steam room afterwards.   Love the Lamar!

I love supporting mom and pop type places!   This place is right down the street from my work. I stop in maybe only 10 times a year, but every time I do I always ask myself why I dont go back more.   Ive only ever gone in the morning for coffee and one of their tasty breakfast sandwiches or fresh bagels! Always amazing! They also have a lunch menu which I have never tried out, I am cheap when it comes to sandwiches and thier prices for that are a touch high, although they do have a program where if you bring in your receipt from your morning coffee you get a discount of some sort. I may have to give it a shot.   The service is always fast and friendly! It kind of has that Friends coffee shop type vibe going on.

Still digging on this place. It is now under new ownership but that hasn't changed them in the slightest.   I stopped in this morning got a wheat everything bagel toasted with butter, SUPER YUM! And a turtle praline latte of sorts. STEAMED CHOCOLATE MILK PEOPLE!!!   If you find yourself in the area give them a whirl. I haven't been dissatisfied yet.

I wish they bottled and sold the salad dressing! Its crack people! Crack on a salad! Cant.Get.Enough.  5. The lunch size sweet and sour chicken is great! If you are really hungry its just enough, or not so hungry its good for a little lunch tomorrow! And the chicken is crisp yet light, and its not drenched in sauce, its just perfectly sauced...always!   I heart you Flo's, I really do. I haven't even taken the hubs here yet, you are like my  little secret! I need to take the hubs here, he will love it and most likely leave me to make out with the salad dressing, cause its that amazing!

Sooo I was super excited to go to Morton's, it was the hubs and my first date since having a baby 3 months ago. We got all dolled up and off we went. We met another couple their for Restaurant Week.   My boss had warned me that the noise level was excessive and that the steaks were average. I wish I would have listened and just went to Ruth's Chris where we know the food is always great and you can carry on a conversation with out yelling like you are in a bar at a punk rock concert.   Even going during Restaurant Week where the 3 course meal was $40 a person our bill for 4 people came out to well over $400. We all had several drinks each, but they so kindly do not put prices next to the drinks, so you have no idea how much you are spending.   First course I ordered the chopped salad, it was nice, it was a salad...how hard is it.   Second course I ordered the 6 oz fillet medium well. It was nothing amazing. Just ok.  I had that with the side of cream corn, it was gross. I also ordered a side of the onion & Bacon mac and cheese for the table...it didn't come out until we were all almost done with our meals. And I am sad I ordered it because it was not good at all.   Third course, I ordered the Key Lime Pie, it was not edible. It tasted like Lysol. Very chemically tasting.   So all in all, was it the worst experience I have ever had? No. Would I go back? No.

Woot Woot!!!  After going to the grocery store and buying what I thought was the correct battery only to find out that those small 3V batteries come in a multitude of sizes which the grocery store only carries the standard size I knew that Batteries Plus would help me out.   I walk in and am greeted promptly by the store manager. I show him what I am looking for and he produces the battery in under a minute!   I will now be able to weigh myself again, wah wah.   Thank you Battery Plus! You rule!

If I could marry Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles I WOULD! (shhhh dont tell my husband!!)   I LOVE THIS PLACE! And I am a girl who does NOT eat meat off the bone. I dont eat chicken off the bone, I dont eat ribs off the bone, Steak, NOTHING...But at Lo Lo's I sure as hell do!!!! Best fried chicken you will find anywhere! Hands down!   I always get the Betty Boop and depending on how hungray I am an extra Breast! The hubs and I usually split a bowl of their grits, which are AMAZING! Sometimes we do the grits with salt and pepper other times load it up with Syrup! Yummmm  I love that they have Kool Aid there! Seriously RAD!   If you havent gone to Lo Lo's yet you are missing out. They do have a new Scottsdale location that is far less scary to go to (At the Phx location I always wonder if my car will be there when we are done eating, so far so good!!)   You need to go, you will thank me ;)

****NEWS FLASH****  Lolo's now has the BLUE kool-aide! ::dies::  Hubs and I found ourselves on the south side of Phoenix last night, I looked at him and said we are right by Lolo's, no other discussion was needed.   The waffles were even more amazing then the last time, if that is even possible. The chicken was fantastic, looove me the Betty Boop!

This review breaks my heart.   A few friends and I met up at the down town location, I was excited to see that the newly renovated and expanded LoLo's was now open for business! It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!  That's about where the love ends with this review sadly.   We were waiting for one other friend to arrive, they would not seat us until he was there, I have never had this issue at Lolo's. But wait we did.   When we were finally seated the waitress took our food and drink order. 10 minutes goes by, no drinks. She comes to our table and says they are our of glasses and we have to wait for clean ones. We asked her if she could just put them in to-go cups, we didn't need the mason jars, she says sure. 10 more minutes go by. Finally out come our drinks, in mason jars. OI.   Next up is the wait for the food. We literally waited an HOUR AND A HALF for our food to come to the table, and I believe the only reason why we got it then was because we had complained to the manager. The table that was seated 10 minutes after us, got fed up and left at about the hour 15 mark and walked out. A table next to us who had received their bill sat and waited a solid 20 minutes just to pay the dang thing! Our waitress completely ignored our table and section the whole time we waited. There were not even drink refills in that 1.5 hour wait. NOTHING. I got up and found a waitress and pointed out our table at the hour mark and asked how long the food wait was, she said 40 minutes, when I told her we were already well passed that she said she would find out what was going on. Nothing. Then our waitress walks by our section at the hour 15 mark we ask her what the hell is going on, we get no real response. FINALLY we are at 1.5 hours and we are ready to walk, our friend goes and finds the manager and asks him whats going on and to please come talk to us. 2 minutes later the manager comes to our table with food! Yesssssss only its wrong, BOO :( They delivered 2 orders of stupid fries to the table, when we told him we only ordered one he said well we are just going to throw this away so keep it, which I am glad we did because it was going to still be a while for all the food to come out correctly. My friends order was the veggie plate, 2 of the 4 sides were wrong, then they tried to deliver the same wrong veggie plate again. She finally gets all of her food. meanwhile myself and a friend are STILL waiting for ours. Then he gets his and the manager says so that's it right??? Ummmm no...how about bringing the pregnant lady her food, eh?  My food finally materializes and I am happy. The tell me that they are out of french fries but that they just cut up some potato's and made some fries, fine by me. My friend ordered the catfish and specifically asked the waitress for malt vinegar, she brings him out a cup of white vinegar....who does that?   Ive been to both locations plenty of times and have never had this type of experience. It was seriously the worst....and to top that all off when our bill came there wasn't one bit of a discount on it, after all of that, everything we had been through, nothing. we were pretty disappointed in how the staff handled themselves. Not cool Lolo's, not cool at all. I think its rad that you expanded, but if you cant handle the customer load then whats the point?

I am sure if my husband sees this he may just very well divorce me!  He has been going to the OHW since he was a kid, and even though I am an AZ native as well, I had never been here.   So last Friday after work, I said I need a burger and a beer, and we ended up here vs our usual Originial Wineburger (the 19th ave and Bethany location).   I thought the atmosphere was fun, they are going for the this-place-is-old-as-hell-and-may-fall-apart-at-any-moment-yet-clean look.  Our order was taken very quickly, but its kind of confusing that you order at one register and then walk around, and stand and wait to be noticed to pay at the other register only 10 feet from the one you were just at...but whatev.   Our food was out very fast! We each ordered burgers, then we split some fries and onion rings. The onion rings will get me to go back again, they were soooo good! The fries were ok. My burger was dry, had no flavor and the bun was stale as all get out.   The condiment bar, ie the build your own burger, didn't impress me. There was nothing special on it. Seriously toss some green olives on there and you may peak my interest...but everything on the condiment stand could easily be in bottles at each table.   I went to the bar and got 2 bottles of Stella...for $8, holy heck! Not cool. We sure as heck werent in Scottsdale last I checked we were in the avenues.   I do have to say, one thing that actually made my mouth drop open and then when I showed it to the hubs his mouth also dropped open in disbelief was that they have Barqs RED CREAM SODA!!! Thats like the holy grail of sodas right there! If they offered vanilla ice cream there I may have just moved in and lived off of red cream soda floats for the rest of my life or until I slipped into a diabetic coma.   If the hubs wants to go back I will not fight it only because of the red cream soda and the onion rings. But as far as burgers go, give me a Original Wineburger, I like burgers that have flavor, are juicy and on amazing freshly baked buns!

Do you love fabric?  Are you into taking risks in life, such as going to the South side of PHX?  Do you enjoy getting amazing service from a man who looks like a roughed up Samuel L. Jackson, minus a few fingers?   Then H & R Sales is your place!   The fabric selection here is sooooo good! They also have just about every finishing touch you could think of that involves any sort of fabric/leather/vinyl project.   Redoing your car or boats interior, this would be your place.   Making draperies, reupholstering a headboard or any other furniture item, this is your place.   Looking for a fancy nail head, a zipper, a gaggle of blinged out fringe to tie back your curtains, this is your place.   Its a huge warehouse that is surprisingly air conditioned. It is in a rough part of town, but when I pulled in I felt left out as there were like 4 Lexus' in the parking lot. If you are not into dodging bums and crazy passer bys on bicycles, then maybe this isn't the place for you.   I found a GREAT fabric for my next DIY project around the house and the staff was soooo friendly and didn't rush me even though I came barreling in 20 minutes before they closed.

Oh. My. YUM!  Ive driven past this seedy strip mall a million and one times and never would have suspected a tasty Chinese place resided inside.   Some friends from out of town were visiting, they wanted Chinese and jumped on Yelp. The Prime popped up...none of us had ever been so we figured we would give it a whirl.   they get 5 stars for food. Every single dish was AMAZING and the egg drop soup was THE BEST I have ever had! The crab puffs were tasty, but had onions in them (which I loooove onions) just wasn't a fan of the onion in them. We had 4 dishes on the table and everyone enjoyed everything, there wasn't a scrap left on the plates, even the picky toddlers that were with us got down.   Minus one star for service. There was one waitress and from what i could see, one cook. There were 4 tables of 2, a 3 top and then us 5 adults and 3 toddles. It took a very long time for food to come out and when it did it trickled out slowly.....BUT the food was soooo good we didn't care, everyone was excited for the next dish!   We will FOR SURE be going back again regardless of staffing issues.

I Heart the Melrose Vintage!   This shop is too cute for words! I loooove all the vintage furniture and decor items, just wish they didn't cost my first born.   The scrapbook section is UNREAL! I don't even scrapbook, yet I found myself spending an hour and a half in this store just thinking up all the fun little crafty things I could do!   This is definitely not the type of shop you take the hubs to, mine would have a melt down in 3 seconds flat if I even tried to pull bringing him in here!   The baby section is swoon worthy but very $$$

Oh boy.   I've been on a big fish and chips kick lately.   We rolled through the drive thru on Saturday night.   The food is cheap....and rubbery...and stale....if fish and chips could have a stale taste, this place takes the win.   I did like their dipping sauce, it was garlicy...I do like mine sweet, but it was a nice change.   And I know its deep fried,but damn...the little napkin they put in the bottom of your to go box was all translucent from soaking up the oil.   As the hubs put it...this place is good if you are really good and drunk, otherwise, pass.

Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaah We went to the Winey last night AND they added WET FRIES to the menu!   (well its not technically on the menu yet, but there are little signs telling you to try them)   SUPER TASTY! The gravy was a little on the thin side for my liking, but it was realllly flavorful anyway. Totally a must order when we go back!

So, its Friday night and the hubs and I need to make a Costco run. We figure we will grab a hot dog or slice of pizza at Costco, but apparently Costco food court is the place to be on a Friday night, the line was crazy town long.   Before I blacked out and went into a hunger induced rage, the hubs escorted me over to the Charleys Grilled Sub area. I was hesitant, but couldn't muster up the will power to stand in the costco line and not get stabby.   I ordered the Chicken Philly. It was ok. The bread was the best part of the sandwich, Hubs and I split a drink and an order of frys.   The frys came with oozy cheese and nasty bacon. Super gross. BUT if you like fake cheese ooze and fake bacon crumbles then these are for you.   The tables that surround the Charleys area were all soooo filthy. I wiped one clean with a napkin and noticed everyone else who came to eat here had to wipe a table clean. The employee's clearly do not care to make a clean space for customers to eat. I know this is a food court-ish setting (However its just Charleys and Costco and costco has their own tables) someone needs to be wiping these tables down. Even if its not ever customer, at least make an attempt.   At any rate, I do not believe I will be eating here again. I will stand in the long Costco line. Lesson learned.

OH DEAR LORD! (and not in a good way)   So I've been wanting to check this place out for over a year now. This past Saturday I finally convince the hubs to go with me.   This is a place that takes donations from people who are renovating their homes, you can find anything home related as far as building materials and the like go.   I was pumped on finding a bath vanity, people have reported that they have stuff there from high end homes.   We must have been on a very very off day as everything there looked to be from the 80's mayyyybe 90's and older. Nothing current or that would even fly in a bath remodel these days.   The appliances they offer there are old as hell as well, there wasn't anything worth looking at. And used toilets? EW!

I needed to go to Urgent Care a couple weeks ago.   This place was the closest so off we went.   The waiting area leaves much to be desired, but whatever. We waited for maybe 20 minutes before being called back.   The nurse who saw me was very nice and friendly and truly seemed concerned about me.   There was never more then 15-20 minutes that went by that the nurse or doctor wasn't in my room.   I wish I remembered the doctors name, she was sooo nice! (young with short hair and just adorable) She was very concerned about me, they did an EKG and xray on my lungs which looked great but she felt I needed blood work done more urgently then they can provide and strongly urged me to go to the ER.   The rooms are old but there was a tv in there to keep us entertained.   If I ever needed to go to an Urgent Care again I would not hesitate to go here again.

You know you are getting old when you are excited about finding a rad paint store!   The guys here are always super friendly and extremely helpful.   I've always been pleased with my paint purchases.   The hours kinda suck they close at 5 during the week, however they open super early. So I just called in my order in the afternoon, I needed 6 paint samples, and drove by at 645 in the morning the next day and they had them ready for me. They are open on Saturdays, but again for a limited time. That's my only gripe.   The products they sell are top notch and the color selection they have is vast.

Dear Albertsons on 19th Ave and Northern.  You SUCK!  Seriously, wow. I decided to give Albertsons a whirl on Saturday for my dinner party grocery needs. I needed a ton of produce and meat.   I bought a 10 pound bag of potatos, got home and they ALL had eyes, they were soft to the touch and green. I bought 3 pears, they had some bad bruising on the inside that wasn't easily detected from the outside (otherwise I wouldn't have bought them). I bought 1 sweet potato, started to peel it and it had black spots all over it.   Who ever is running the produce dept over there is not on top of things.   The meat selection was good. Better then my close by Fry's.   I liked the wide aisles, but it was hard to find things.   I will stick to my Fry's and Safeway that are much closer and don't sell bad produce.

ILOVETHECRACKERBARREL!!!!!!!!!!!!   The Cracker Barrel has been a family "bon voyage" breakfast staple. When ever we go to visit the parents or they come to visit us, on the last day we always end up at the CB for breakfast!   I always get the Sunrise Sampler because you get a little bit of everything!  That heavenly hash brown casserole is INSANE, I could eat it for the rest of my life! true story!   The grits, with the warm maple syrup and gobs of butter, yummmm!   The baked apples.GAH!   The biscuits and gravy, lord have mercy!   The smoked Sausage! I always ask for all sausage, And skip the one piece of bacon and one piece of ham, pile on that tasty sausage please!   The eggs are a after thought for me and fill in the blanks while I am trying to figure out what to eat next!   The service is always great! We are generally a table of 6-12 people, and they always get our order right.

Lets set the scene.   Its 7 am on Black Friday. I am 6th in line outside in the freezing ass 40 something degree weather with a bunch of people that looked like they had played D&D all.night.long.   I am on a mission. The husbands bday and Christmas are both fast approaching. The husband has talked no stop ever since we met about how badly he wanted/needed a new drum set.   Guitar Center is selling a $1200 Pearl set for $600 bones, Sweet.   So I size up my competition, I mean the people in line around me. None of The immediate people around me are there for the drum set, but I can hear a few people back talking about the exact drum set. I've never set foot in a GC before. I have no music skill what so ever. So I ask the people in front of me where the drum section is so I can make a break for it when they unlock the doors. They inform me and I get my game face on.   The doors fly open at 8 and off I go. I see a sale associate standing in front of the drum section, I make eye contact with him and give him a gesture to let him know I mean business.   The person I dealt with was named Sean (Or at least that's the name of the cashier on my receipt) He was extremely helpful, He answered all the questions I had and even lugged all the drum boxes out to my car for me and loaded them up. I had a very good experience here.

So I live in the ghetto and this is the Home Depot I go to even though there is one a tad closer to my house.   The staff here is always very friendly and very very helpful! On my recent trip Denny in the hardware section was beyond helpful, I wouldnt have been able to complete my project without his help!   The Hubs and I also purchased carpeting from here for our bedrooms. They look great and were installed quickly!

Well....I got sucked in. I already dislike Domino's to begin with...But I have been seeing all those commercials where they are bagging on themselves and saying how the pizza is completely new and improved.   Well that's a load of Horse $h!t.   We ordered a pizza last night because I am a bad wife and haven't gone grocery shopping. I say to the hubs, hey lets give it a shot. He moans in disgust. I say, well they say its completely new and improved, lets just try it out.   We ordered on line. That was really cool. You can follow your order in the shop while they are making it. We even knew our delivery drivers name before he got to our door because the update told us his name and that he just left. That's rad...I would give Domino's a 3 just on this alone!   We ordered their new pizza with the special crust and then new fancy sauce. Kept it simple and just got pepperoni on it. We also got an order of cheese bread sticks and some of there boneless chicken kicker things.   The chicken kickers were tasty. I really liked the dipping sauce.   The cheese bread was yummy as well!   The new fan-dangled pizza....HOLY GROSS!!! Same old Domino's people...   Do not get sucked into the hype of that dumb commercial.   The commercial should go more like:  Hey we have been getting complaints that our pizza sucks.  So we changed it up and guess what PIZZA STILL SUCKS!   Our cat that always begs for food didn't even come around asking for pizza. That's pretty bad, that cat will eat anything! In fact, from now on, any take out we get will have a Tuki (our cat) rating on it.   Tuki gives this zero stars, as he didn't even want it near him.

Yummmmmmmmmmmm!  We moved to this area a year ago and every time I drive by this place I keep telling myself I want to try it.  Well the hubs and I finally did this weekend! Sooooo freaken tasty!!! I didn't get to go inside, I was outside with the dog, but the hubs said it ruled with all kinds of delightful items!  The canoli's were AMAZING!!! I could eat 10 right now!  The sandwiches were so good, my only complaint (and reason why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars) is that they ONLY offer a 10". Thats a load of crap, cut that in half and let people buy a 5" for the love of god! The hubs and I come from two different sandwich camps, I love mustard and mayo on mine and he is only a mayo guy, so we cant even split a sandwich. wah wah.  I am really excited to go back and check this place out for myself. They have a full deli counter and I cant wait to drool over the pastry case!

Cannoli's. People, if you even THINK you know what a good cannoli tastes like, then you are sorely mistaken. Romanelli's hands down has the best cannoli's I've ever had.  Ridiculous!   The people who work here are so extremely friendly. I dropped in yesterday at 10 minutes til closing and I wasn't rushed at all. I ordered 2 sandwiches, a pound of the macaroni salad and made my way to the register.   I noticed they were all out of cannoli's but the lady behind the counter had 2 made up for me, THAT's customer service!   If you ever find yourself over by Metro Center and want a sub or even some baked zitti or lasagna go give them a whirl!

So I fall asleep watching the food network, I wake up and was sleeping through a show about amazing hot dog places all across the U.S., now, I am not a hot dog fan, but I must have had some sort of hot dog subliminal message pumped into my brain while I slept, because I needed a hot dog like 10 minutes ago.   I jump on Yelp to find a hot dog place near my house....They are all closed on Sunday or further then I care to drive. So I think, hey, lets hit up Lenny's, I bet they have a decent dog.   I believe I gained 5 pounds from this meal. I ordered the polish sausage, mustard, onion and relish. Fries and a butterscotch shake.   The polish sausage was insanely good, in fact, I cant stop thinking about it! Its a MUST try!   The fries are fantastic, they put season salt on them! Who else does that? No one! I could eat these french fries all day long.   AND lets not forget the butterscotch shake! People, this was my very first butterscotch shake, I was a butterscotch shake virgin. I am soooo glad I no longer am, because now I am a butterscotch shake slut! I will do what I can to get my paws on one of these amazing treats. Do yourself a favor and order the large, your eyes will fall out of their sockets when you see how large it is. I have been nursing mine for 3 days now. Its HUGE! You could easily split it with 2-3 people!   Lenny's, I heart you.

I went here yesterday and had a really great experience!   I was on a mission to purchase a treadmill. I was over in the section for only a minute or two when Randy, a sales associate approached me and asked if I needed help. I asked him the few questions I had, satisfied with the answers I told him which one I wanted to purchase.   He rang me up and sent me on my way to the pick up area.   The pick up area is pretty dismal, but Sears goal is to not have you wait. you walk in and scan your receipt under a bar code reader, a monitor displays the progress of your order. In less then 50 seconds (And this is not an exaggeration, as the screen was counting down how long the process would take) Wes was walking through the double doors with my brand new treadmill! He loaded it up in my car and off I went!   The whole purchasing process from beginning to end was MAYBE 30 minutes total! Totally great experience!

First off I thought I had already review Lai Lai but I guess not.  Had I reviewed it I would have given it a solid 3.  Now I want to give it a zero.   I don't know what happened but the Mongolian BBQ no longer exists. The hubs and I went in there this past Friday and it was all ripped out.   They tried to get us to stay to order off the menu, which was just Chinese food...I reallllly wanted Mongolian BBQ.   So sad. They are right down the street from us. No more Lai Lai for me.

So I ran into Safeway on my way home from work for a few things, I didn't need a cart but a hand basket would have worked, but they were all gone.   I said F it and off I went.   By the time I got to the produce section I had my hands full with a loaf of bread, some cheese and a 5lb bag of potatos and en route to the meat section for some sausage when an employee (I am thinking meat department, he had a white coat on) approached me and asked if he could go get a cart for me! That's customer service!   I thanked him, but I was on my way to the check out after grabbing one more item.   Every employee here is always sooo nice.

Just took our new Pup into Palm Glen and boy was I impressed! The staff there is so nice and cares about the animals.  The vet we met with took extra time with us since we were first time puppy owners and gave us a bunch of useful tips and advice on how to train our dog.   They do boarding and grooming as well! Which we will be using in the near future

Still loving this place! They are always so friendly and helpful!   We have since boarded and had Ladmo groomed here since my first review.   The groomer is great with him and doesn't force things. If Ladmo feels uncomfortable, she only does as much as he allows her to.   We also had him boarded here over Thanksgiving. He seemed to have a great time, They gave him a bath before pick up and charged WAY LESS then Petsmart does for their boarding!

So the pup hit the one year mark and had to go in for his shots and a well check. The doctor we had been seeing has since moved away, so I was pretty bummed....Until we met Dr. Svoboda!!!!   HE RULES!!!! He was so good with Ladmo and answered all our questions!   I am so thankful I found Palm Glen, the staff is always so excited to see Ladmo and they are all so friendly. Keep it up!

The hubs and I went here a few weeks ago looking for an entertainment center. We ended up leaving with out an entertainment center but a brand new sectional instead!   The hubs and I had no plans to buy, but when we saw the sectional we both stopped dead in our tracks. We never agree on anything when it comes to decor so we knew we had to buy, but we weren't a fan of the color or material. Oscar helped us out. We got to custom order a couch with out paying anything additional!!! How rad is that! The Roomstore lets you change out fabrics and even switch out pillow patterns. Only bummer is since its custom we have to wait 6-8 weeks. But that's ok, we will wait!   Thanks to Oscar for not only helping us out but not hovering over us like a vulture like some furniture stores do!

I think all sandwich shops should have a drive thru!   I live close by and like to roll through here at least once a month.  The sandwiches are always spot on! And dont get me started on their BBQ chips!   The employees are a bit "cracky" but super friendly and funny and I love them!   This location has been there for years and I hope it stays that way!

You know, sometimes you just need some old school ghetto Italian food, and the OG services that purpose for me!   Yes....I am a fan of Olive Garden, THERE I said it! I could live off of their salad and bread sticks alone!   I always order the same thing and it always tastes the same. That's one thing a chain restaurant like the OG has going for them, consistently the same. Doesn't matter where I go in the U.S. my eggplant parmigiana will always taste and look the same.   Last Friday I didn't want to cook and I wanted Italian. Since we are still somewhat new to the 'hood and don't know all the local spots yet, we jumped in the car and went to Olive Garden. When we pulled up there were people EVERYWHERE, like laying in the grass outside of the restaurant all homeless style. I thought for sure it would be an hour wait, but the hostess said 20-30 minutes. We saddled up to the bar, got an adult beverage and 20 minutes later we were being shown to our seat.   I must say, our waiter was FANTASTIC! His name was Will and he deserves a raise! He was on top of the ball, had a bit of cheese about him on the delivery of his lines, but it was never annoying (I HATE when waiters pour on the cheese and don't know when to stop, or how to be funny) But no Will, dude was all over it and great!   Our dinners arrived fast, tasted great and our drinks never got low.

I had a really great experience here!   I called on Wednesday and spoke to Trevor, told him my make, model and year and he looked up some tires for me and gave me a quote for an out the door price.   I did call around and found that not only did Discount have the best prices but they had a really helpful and friendly staff, other places I called acted like it was a bother to give a quote over the phone.   Friday after work Trevor was there to help me when I dropped off my car. I didn't want to wait around so he told me I could leave my car there and pick it up in the morning. Rad!   So yeah, New tires, Very exciting!

Since when did Swensens start sucking, or has it always and I just had lower standards in high school?   So the hubs and I dropped off the pup over at Petsmart to be groomed and want to grab a quick bite. We see Swensens and both get excited as neither of us have been there since high school.   We walk in and are seated promptly. Our waiter was friendly and quick.   We both ordered a burger & fries and we split a malt.   The burger were pretty sad. You can tell they are not fresh and that they come from a freezer, the patties were pretty rubbery. We both order burgers that came on sourdough bread grilled in a garlic butter and Parmesan cheese spread. The bread was boarder line burned/unedible. Not grilled at all,but charred and black. The fries were decent.   The malt was tasty. But nothing show stopping.   Swensens is probably good for ice cream and that's it. I wouldn't go here for a meal ever again.

Woah. The Wright House has soooo much potential, but they fail big time.   I was a bridesmaid a couple of weeks ago at a wedding and reception that were held at the Wright House. I actually told my friend the bride that if I were in her shoes I would not tip her coordinator (Tiffany) a dime. Reasoning below: 1. Tiffany told us that she would be near the wedding and visible all night, We could NEVER find her and all 4 bridesmaids would have to go looking for her if we had a question/issue.   2. When we were doing the rehearsal, we had issues with some of the bridesmaids sinking into the grass, instead of offering a solution we got a snide "I cant pour concrete in one day" remark from her. Not cool. The brides step dad brought 2 stepping stones from his own yard for the girls to stand on, problem solved.   3. Tiffany told us that the bridal suite would be locked AT ALL TIMES and that we could leave our purses and valuables in there. She said to just come find her (ya right) when ever we needed anything. On 5 occasions through out the night I went to the room and it was UNLOCKED each time and no Tiffany in sight. Not cool. The Wright House is on a very busy street and any one could walk off the street and right inside and could have taken our things.   4. I thought the DJ was our personal butler! Before the reception got started he took the whole bridal parties drink order, brought us our drinks and got us refills when we needed. I didn't realize he was the DJ until it was time to get the reception started. You would think that Tiffany would maybe check on us like he did, no such luck.   5. When the bride went back the following day to get the rest of her stuff, some things had been misplaced and not kept safe like Tiffany had told her they would be.   As for the place itself. The garden/ceremony area is sooo beautiful and very well maintained.   The reception hall and bridal suite on the other hand is a JOKE. The carpets in the bridal suit were filthy! The reception hall had decorative tables displaying flowers and such, the tables were shabby and you could see broken off pieces just hanging from them.    Its a shame. This place could really be nice. It needs updating, cleaning and a new staff.

I am completely floored by all the reviews that are less then 5 stars! Seriously people, its ice cream, don't be so serious!   I have been coming to the Sugar Bowl for yearssssss, I cant get enough of this place!   Its always packed on the weekends, but the wait is hardly ever grueling.   They do serve food here, think sandwiches your rad grandma would make you on a Sunday afternoon. Not mind blowing, but certainty yummy and hit the spot!   I have only ever had the Top Hat here, I sub the vanilla ice cream for the coffee ice cream. This sundae is my crack! Its the fluffiest puff pastry, they cut off the top, cram a bunch of fabulous ice cream inside, put the little top back on and then smother it in the thickest, gooiest most heavenly hot fudge, ask for extra napkins (I always end up with a ring of hot fudge around my mouth like a 6 year old)!!!   Yes the place has old ass wallpaper, its called history people its been around since 1958! Unlike the ever changing landscape and buildings of AZ this one has stayed true to itself. Forget the disco lights and loud music of MoJo, give me the big cushy pink booths and chipped tile floors of the glorious Sugar Bowl!!!

Meh. Its average (at best) Italian food.   We went here last week for a dinner with the hubs company.   We were in a small semiprivate room and there were maybe 15 people in our group. Our waiter was pretty bad, acted like he didn't want to be there, and at one point when someone FINALLY got his attention after attempting to flag him down twice to ask for a drink refill he actually snarled his lip a bit!   The food. Some was really good, some was really bad. I had the Caesar salad, it was salad, its hard to mess up. I also had a piece of the plain bread...its really "doughy". For the main course there was the chicken Marsala which was very sweet, almost to sweet. The baked zitti tasted pretty spot on and was the best of the three. Lastly there was the fettuccine Alfredo, holy blob of white tasteless pasta. I salt and peppered and added more grated parm to it and it still lacked flavor, it was beyond gross.   For dessert there was cheese cake and chocolate cake. The cheese cake had no crust but was decent. The chocolate cake was pretty moist and good.   Will I go back here again? Only if invited by someone else and they are paying, no way would I put my own money towards this place.

Not only is George and Son's super tasty, but George himself is one of the funniest nicest guys you will meet!   My company has hosted the annual Christmas luncheon at Georges two years in a row now, and there is a good reason why, The food is ALWAYS spot on and the service is always above and beyond!   My boss always orders ahead of time and it seems like coarse after coarse comes out from the kitchen.   Some of the highlights that stick out in my head, The Shrimp with glazed walnuts, the noodles w/chicken, and the pot stickers. We had about 8 different dishes and I cant pretend to remember them all.   One note of warning. George likes to mess with people. My boss had duck sent to the table, George set the plate in front of me with the ducks fried head just staring back at me! Eeeep! hahah   If you are up in this neck of the woods go drop by!

Pita Jungle can do NO WRONG in my eyes!   The food has always been amazing! I have been going here for 10 years or so and have never left displeased.  Also they are a home spun local business, which always makes me happy!   Yes, they do have hipper then thou hipster working there, but those hipsters can sure make a mean hummus!   I have many favorites which is starting to make it hard when I go there, because I want them all! Pita Jungles portions are always so generous that I have never even finished what I ordered.   My new fav is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, the mix of the lentils and rice with the caramelized onions over the fresh mixed greens with that lemon vinaigrette is WHOA! Its incredibly filling, split it with 2 or 4 friends, seriously!   Another fav is off the starters section, but its so much food that I never finish! The lavosh pita crisp! Its like a fancy spicy supped up cheese crisp!   Thank You Pita Jungle for bringing bomb diggity food to the valley!

We grabbed some dinner here last night before catching a show at Gammage.   We were the ONLY people in this place, yet the staff acted like they were slammed, very short with us and it took quite some time for our order to come out.  The food was good, though the bread bowls that the soup came in tasted like they were a few days old, very dry and crumbly vs the normal super fresh tasting bread bowls you get here.

So my doctor has put me on a mandatory 1 month vegan diet. Lucky for me Green is a vegan restaurant!   I have always wanted to try Green, but had never really had an excuse to go.   So Friday night the hubs and I make the trek across town. We arrived about 630 and it was JAM PACKED. Not a seat to be had. At Green you stand in line and place your order at the register and pay for it then. You find a seat and a waiter will come out and yell your name and then deliver your food.   We placed our order and took a table outside as that was all there was. Kinda sucked, but oh well. It did start to rain, but there was a little over hang keeping us dry.  We ordered starters. Crab Puffs and Spicy Buffalo "wings" Both were pretty good. The crab puffs were spot on, you really couldn't tell a difference between them and the real thing. The "wings" were good as well, but for sure a big difference between the real thing and the mock. But still tasty.   The hubs ordered the Original "g" Spicy Po-Boy, a Spicy buffalo mock chicken sammie and I got the Mum's Meatball Po-Boy. Both were really very good. The Thyme fries are really crisp and tasty, but like other reviews, you cant really taste the thyme, not sure whats up with that.   After we were done, we decided to get a couple Tsoynamis to go. I am a ice cream FREAK, so that WAS going to be my biggest challenge getting through the 1 month Vegan diet...but not anymore. OMG...The tsoynami's are AMAZING!!! I had the Deez Hazelnuts, freaken fantastic! The hubs got the Betterfinger (Greens version of a butterfinger) SO GOOD!!!!   We will be going back to green even after I am done with my 1 month stint as a vegan.

I am completely blown away by all the less then 4 star reviews! I have been going to Lo Cascio's for a good 10-12 years and I have never once had a bad experience here. EVER.  Yes the decor is out dated, but really does that effect your eating experience that much? Me thinks not.   And I honestly love the "kitschy" music piped through....since when was Sinatra kitschy?   The hubs, a friend and I all went this past Saturday night. We got there about 7:30 and the parking lot was PACKED! When we got inside we were asked if we had reservations, we told them no and they sid it would be a few minutes. No big deal. We waited maybe 5 minutes.   Our waitress was sooo friendly and helpful. We all had questions and were going back and forth on what to get.   The fresh bread loafs are always a favorite. The soups always change and are terrific.  For starters we got the Mozzarella Marinara and the Calamari Fritto. The mozzarella is a MUST! Seriously it will change the way you view fried mozzarella for the rest of your life. I promise.   I ordered the Gnocchi with pink sauce. OH MY! The gnocchi is made fresh in house and you can tell! Little pillows of heaven! The pink sauce was top notch.  Hubs had the veal, and ate every last bit. He said it was amazing. I would not know as I passed on trying it.   Our friend got the Fantasy Chicken (I think that was the name) It was sooo light and totally outstanding!   We also all got cannolis and coffees at the end, great way to cap off a tasty meal.   So for 3 meals, 2 apps, 3 desserts, 3 coffees and I think 5 glasses of wine hit the table our total bill was only $168. I honestly thought it was going to be well above $200 the way we got down on that dinner.   This is one of my all time fav italian places to hit up. And love supporting mom and pop places.

the hubs and I went and saw Young Frankenstein (thanks Yelp!) here last night! The musical was sooooooooooo good! So funny! Loved it!   We got to Gammage at like 6 and got super front row parking, picked up our tickets at Will Call (easy peasy) and then met up with our friend for dinner who was kind enough to drop us back off at Gammage.   The staff could be a little more helpful, the girl at the front door scanned my ticket and just handed it back to me. I just stood there, noooo idea where I needed to go, I asked her for a little help and she gladly gave it to me, though how hard is it while you are scanning a ticket to say doors to your right, or up the ramp or whatev.   Our seats were amazing, we were in the terrace balcony, row 3.   Some things I noticed about Gammage that need improvement on:   -The bathrooms! GOOD LORD! I've been to truck stops with cleaner bathrooms then this place. It was so dark and dingy in there. Yuck. Also there are only 5 stalls for a gaggle of women, luckily I assessed this situation before the show started so at intermission I jammed it to the restroom. When I came out the line went around the wall and down the ramp, ridiculous.   -The sound cut in and out a few times while the actors were singing or talking, so that was a bit frustrating.   -The temperature was soooooooo cold   -I will never book a center stage seat, you have to climb over like 20-30 chairs/people to get to the middle, a row in the middle would have been totally appropriate for people to get t the center more easily.   All in all it was an enjoyable experience.

The hubs and I are always looking for some good pizza joints. This one is right down the street! They don't deliver, which is a bummer, but it is a 2 minute drive, so its no big D.   We ordered a thin crust pizza, their deep dish takes 45 minutes ( get crabby when I get hungry, so we will have to plan ahead for that)! We got green olives, Italian sausage and garlic on the pie. The garlic threw the whole pizza off for us. There was waaaay to much. Next time we will go sans garlic. Loved the green olives and italian sausage!   We also ordered some fried zucchini. It was tasty, but limp :(   We will for sure be ordering from here again!

We gave Vito's another shot last night. This time we did no garlic on the pizza....it was AMAZING!!! They are right down the street, and are quickly becoming our go to pizza place!  Also I forgot to mention, they cut their pizza in little square, that automatically makes it better in my book!

From the looks of all the reviews maybe we ordered on an off night or ordered the wrong things. We did not have such a great experience.   We got a menu on our door and decided to give this place a try. I placed a phone order and the lady taking my order sounded like she could care less if we were ordering from there.   The food did arrive quick, the menu states allow 45 minutes but i think it got there in about 20, which caught us off guard. I was ::cough:: unavailable and the hubs was doing dishes when the door bell rang. He answered the door about a MINUTE after the door rang and the delivery guy flat out asked him if he was taking a nap! Kinda funny, kinda not.   Hubs ordered some type of sandwich which he was immediately pissed off about. There was barely any meat on it, the bread was rock hard and it just looked like it had sat around all day.   I ordered the Eggplant parm meal which came with some garlic toast and a side salad. The salad was very small and very old looking, wilted lettuce. The pasta was cooked, the sauce was ok, the eggplant was hard to find under the mountain of cheese, which lots of cheese is usually a good thing, but this cheese doesn't like to budge and was like a solid mass.   Maybe after reading other reviews we will try something else but our first impression was less then stellar.

I heart the King Wah!   Its your typical Chinese take out. Its always consistently good. Its not over the top the best I have ever had, but it is far from the worst.   We always order the sweet and sour chicken (all white meat) and the vegetable low mien with a side of crab puffs and fried wontons.   I have never had one complaint about the food. Its always delivered hot and fast. While I am not huge fan of the crab puffs (I am super picky about my puffs) The Hubs lurvs them!   We are so glad we found out about the Wah, its right down the street and good for those nights you don't feel like cooking.   Tuki gives the SS chicken 4 tails!

wah wah...to the new owners of the Wah :(   So King Wah closed for like a month back in October. They reopened as promised...but under completely new ownership.   Menu is the same....but the food, Its different....in a not the same tasty Wah we are used to.   Tuki didn't even beg for food.   We are sad, this was our go to Chinese delivery. Now we must take on the task of finding something new.

LIVE BULL RIDING FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Wednesday nights are armature nights (though you could have fooled me)   The hubs and I headed up as our friends son is apprenticing to be a rodeo clown (Who knew that was possible)   We had a total blast! Those bulls are feisty!   We didn't make it inside, but could hear the live band jamming out. We did hit up the BBQ buffet, pretty dang tasty. For $10 you get a POUND of meat, 2 sides and a biscuit. The hubs and I split a plate and they let you get several different kinds of meat, whatever adds up to a pound.   We will be going back up here again real soon.

I know this makes me un-Arizonan but I am not a fan of Durants.   the husbands family loooooooooooves this place, so I find myself here at least once a year.   So right now its Durants 60th anniversary, and they are giving out free dessert for LIFE tokens. My in-laws are out of town and begged us to go eat dinner (on their dime) to pick up these dessert tokens. So we went this past Sunday.   We had a reservation and were seated right away. The one thing I LOVE about this place is the atmosphere. It is AMAZING, its dark, romantic, and has that amazing 50's vibe I love.   The food is what gets me. For the price you are paying you would expect something fantastic, and it NEVER is.   The salad they bring you is some mixed greens, **maybe** five croutons, and a couple pieces (and by a couple I mean 3 or 4) pieces of very very small diced cucumber overloaded with salad dressing.   The New York Strip has always been over cooked (I ask for it medium it comes out with no pink at all) chewy and full of grizzle and lacking flavor.   The garlic mashed potato's are spot on. But its mashed potato's, you cant really screw those up (unless you're my mom)   The desserts are generally fantastic, on this night we split the creme bruele trio and they were smooth and creamy.   I guess its the price that gets me, for the quality of food you are getting. For 2 people with no Apps or alcohol ordered, our bill with tip was $115. That is OUTRAGEOUS for a poor quality steak. I would rather go to Ruth's Chris where it is always perfect.   Sorry Durant's.

I cant believe I haven't reviewed this place! I've been going here since they opened! The food is always amazing! It is always packed so be prepared to wait. They do take reservations for 6 or more, but that doesn't mean you'll get seated right away.   We went here this past Saturday in honor of the day of my birth. We had 7 with us and had reservations for 630, which I thought we would beat the crowd, but was mistaken. We had to wait for our table for a good 20 minutes, but all good things are worth a wait.   A smooth ass piano player was in the courtyard belting out old classics from Sinatra to the Commodores! Loved him!   Our waiter was good but you could tell he had more tables then he could manage.   The food was amazing as per usual. LOVE the pizza and salads here! My favorite pizza is the Cappriccosa. I have a hard time picking a salad there because I want them all. My top go to's are the Omera or the pear salad, so tasty!   And ALWAYS save room for dessert, the Fresca crepe is my all time favorite!

I've been here a few times and always had a nice time, but I now feel compelled to write a review.  My friend and I went here last night for dinner. Though they were already very busy at only 530, the service was quick and friendly and our food came very fast.   We decided to split the Brussels sprout salad and the short rib tacos.  We were both very excited for the salad, we are both huge Brussels sprouts people. However it fell very short. It would have been a million times better if they served it warm and the Brussels sprouts slightly sauteed. Instead its just a pile of cold chopped up Brussels sprouts and very spars bacon and almonds with 2 slivers of cheese. wah wah.  The short rib tacos were the STAR of the meal and a total meal saver! These were absolutely outstanding says the girl who is not a fan of ribs. I honestly can not stop thinking about them! The flour tortillas that come with are made fresh and you can taste it. It would be helpful if the tortillas were about an inch bigger, but that's my only complaint.   I seriously will only ever get these taco for as long as I go to Chelseas! So yum!   the atmosphere here is very nice. I love all the over sized lamps and flower arrangements. The bathrooms are nice and clean. The booth we were in was a bit saggy and could stand to be a bit firmer, but thats minor.   Keep it up Chelsea's!

I am honestly shocked to see all the less then 5 star reviews on here.   Matt's Big Breakfast serves up an amazing breakfast Every. Single. Time! They are consistent and generally always fast (once you do get seated)   The lack of seating does suck, but the wait is always always ALWAYS worth it!   This small family run business holds a special spot in my heart! The hubs and I used to go here every Saturday when we first started dating. They all know us in there and are always so excited to see us when we do make it back there from time to time. You don't get that at other breakfast/lunch joints around here (family run or not)!   Matts breakfast is so amazing and their lunch menu, Oh. My. YUMMY!!   The egg salad is probably my favorite lunch choice there, the husband swear by the big butter burger!   And breakfast is always a tough choice. They always have a tempting special of the day...If I don't go with the special, then sometimes I do a custom omelet, or the waffle...I HAVE to have bacon and the rosemary potato's whenever I go regardless of what I order. They are a must!   We love Matt's and the whole Matt's family!

Its been a while since the hubs and I had been to Matt's.   We woke up on New Years Eve and I knew Matt's had to be our last breakfast of the year.   We got there at about 930 and were 5th in line! Wooooot!   The hubs and I grabbed a spot on one of the benches and had fun watching all the newbs come up. They always walk right past all the people standing outside waiting, past the sign in page and march inside like they own the place. soooo funny.   The food and service is still as great as its ever been! The waffle was sent from heaven and so was the bacon!   Even though our visits have become few and far between due to moving further away, Ernie still knows who we are and keeps teasing us and asking when we are going to have kids, she is like a distant aunt! Love her!   Keep it up Matts!

This review is going to be based solely on the service, as I looooove the pizza and salads here.   We went in this past Friday, they were busy but not jam packed, there were plenty of open tables.   There were 6 in our party. We ordered 5 pizzas and 2 salads.   4 pizza come out pretty quickly. As the waiter (Who looked like he might be the manager, as he had on a different shirt then the rest of the staff) went to give my little 13 year old cousin her pizza he full on hits her in the head with the pizza plate. She sits there stunned, says ouch, and is holding her head where he hit her. He doesn't even say sorry, instead he says "Ive never seen that happen" and WALKS AWAY. We were all kind of shocked, no sorry???   So 4 pizza are on the table. My mother in law had ordered her own pizza. It become obvious they forgot. We question them on it, the server mumbles something and then another 10-15 minutes go by and out comes her pizza, again no apology.   Ive never experienced service like this at any of the Sauce locations I've been to.   Come on Sauce, step it up.

First of all I cant believe I haven't review Sierra Bonita yet. Our family loves this place! The buttermilk chicken is always a crowd pleaser so is their signature salad, so yum!   The past Sunday I hosted a baby shower in their private rooms. PEOPLE LISTEN UP if you need an event space they do not charge a room fee or make you meet a minimum!!! AMAZING!   Nate the owner, Maria the event coordinator and Michelle our waitress were all just fabulous! When I had a minor freak out that the linens were going to be tan and not white Maria pulled some strings and at no extra cost to me had white linens for my event!   The food was fabulous, all the guests enjoyed their meals. We went during the brunch. And for 16 people with nonalcoholic drinks, tax AND tip my bill was only $280!! That's a damn deal folks!!!   I encourage you to not only go here for dinner but host any party you might want some privacy and exceptional service! P.S. the private rooms are underground and your guests get to ride down via elevator, so it kinda makes it really cool!

Tammie Coe's Coconut cupcake is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITES! Freaken DROOL! Soooo good! My mother in law works close by and sometimes brings a couple of Tammies cuppys with her!  I have had a couple of Tammies cakes. The cake itself is good and so is the filling, but I am not a fan of her fondant in the slightest.   AND lets not forget MJ Breads!   WOAH! I am in serious love with the potato rolls that they make for the holidays. Their buttermilk rolls are tasty as well! These are great rolls for kicking up your holiday spread a couple notches!

OH MAN! I attended a shower this past Saturday that had a Tammie Coe cake there! It was unbelievable!   The cake was a sponge cake, it had some kind of custard filling that may have been made by angels with layers of fresh diced strawberries. So heavenly!

This little Coffee shop is cool as hell! Its in an old gas station and has tons of character!   During nice weather they roll up their garage doors and let the inside and outside become one!   The service is always fast and friendly! The drinks and pastries always hit the spot!   I always make it a point to hit this place up when I am doing my antiquing in the Melrose district!

Oh wow!  I drive past this place on the I-17 like a bazillion times a month, and I always say to myself that I want to go there, but always forget about it when I am hungry... Well Lucky for me I remembered this place last Saturday when I got home from work and didn't want to cook.   So the hubs and I set out to go. It is a bit hard to find, but we know how to get there now off of 27th ave vs getting on the I-17 and driving past it to find it. When we pulled into the parking lot I knew it was going to be a nice dinner. The parking lot is PRETTY! How often do you see a pretty parking lot, and in Phoenix no less. Its covered with trees and that pleases me.   We were seated right away and our waitress was right there to take our order. We told her it was our first time there and she gave us the whole run down of the place.   We ordered the onion block, it was tasty but I wasn't a fan of the dipping sauces they offered. The waitress brought us a chipotle ranch that almost sent me running for the hills, not good.   For dinner the hubs ordered some plate full of meat, I think he got the beef ribs along with a side of mac and cheese and pecan coleslaw. He said the ribs were really good, I didn't try them as I am a sissy when it comes to meat on bones. I did taste the mac, it was creamy but not cheesy enough for me, but I am super picky about my mac and cheese. Same goes for coleslaw, there is no middle ground its either great or not so great...unfortunatley Bobby Q's coleslaw fell in the not so great, it just has zero flavor. But that wont stop us from going back.   I ordered the beef brisket sandwich, OH MY HEAVEN! Soooo good! I ordered mine with the shoestring fries, they were really yummy! Very similar to Houston's fries! Also the waitress brought us out a little carafe of extra BBQ sauce which was super tasty and I slathered my sandwich with it.   We had no room for dessert, so the waitress brought us these cute little donuts which the hubs and I were so excited to eat, we took them home and place them on the counter. Apparently our cat and the dog were in co-hoots with one another, as the cat knocked the bag of donuts on the ground and the pup took off with them :(   The atmosphere and decor is very cool, its nice and cozy and dark in the place. We are fans and will for sure be going back!

This place is AMAZING!!! Dont let the name fool you into thinking its only doll house items, they have some of THE COOLEST toys I have ever seen! After working in the airpark for almost 10 years I finally went into this place as I was in need of a birthday gift and saw the "& Toys" on their sign. I am so glad I did! It is now my #1 go to spot  for all the kiddo's in my life! They have toys for all age ranges from infants on up. We just had a baby and I have to reign it in when I go in so I dont go broke. I have now been back 3 times in the past month since I discovered this place. All the toys I have brought to birthday parties have been a huge hit and very unique! I cant wait to do all my Christmas shopping here.

I just caught the Pixies here on Friday night and forgot how much I loved the Mesa Amphitheater! Its been a few years since i've been there, in fact I think the last time I was there was the last time the Pixies were here.   One big down fall is the parking situation. Although by some sort of weasel like Magic my sister and I were able to get in the line for the parking lot and got the last spot for only $5! Score.   The line to get in was a bit of a cluster f*ck, but I ran into Dallas G. and chatted him up a bit, so that was cool.   Once in my sister and I got some pretty prime seats. We each brought in a 20 oz. bottle of water so we didn't have to pay some crazy price to keep hydrated, more venues should do this.   The sound was AMAZING!   My only other compliant is all the smoke. I get that its outside, but damn.... I felt sick to my stomach when we left. Maybe if they made a designated smoking area to keep it all in one place would be cool....but there I go showing my old again.

DUDES!!! This place means serious business!   The hubs and I have gone twice in the past 2 weeks and have had a great experience both times.   The first time we went I used the Yelp APP to find a place open on Sunday night that served French Onion Soup and Corbin's popped up so off we went! The French Onion was great! We also got the house made potato chips. Now I am not much of a feta girl nor am I a fan of hot sauce in any way shape or form.... Corbin's puts BOTH on their potato's chips and it freaken BLEW MY MIND!!!!! Seriously people get the chips!!!!  They make deserts fresh daily so they are always changing. The staff is super friendly and the place has a casual vibe to it.   We have found a new favorite low key awesome food go to place!

This place is adorable but a little hard to find when its dark outside, we drove past it and had to circle back around.   The place was jam packed this past Saturday and our group of nine were actually able to swoop in on a little corner booth, score! Our waitress was there with in seconds which surprised me considering how busy they were I was expecting to wait but so glad we didn't. She took our drink order and with in 5 minutes we were all enjoying our beverages!   We only stayed for one drink as we had other places we wanted to go. This place is very cozy and romantic. I hear they have great food, I must try it next time, as I love Matt's Big Breakfast and this is the same family that runs that breakfast joint!   They also had live music, just a guy in the corner playing guitar and singing, he was good and set a nice vibe.   I will be back! Hi Ernie!!!

Hrmmm im honestly surprised at the lack of 5 star reviews for this location.  I have been stopping in here for 5 or so years and have never had one bad experience.   I stopped in on Wednesday, got a bagel with schmear and a large hot chia tea latte.   My complaints are that the drinks come WAY SUPER HOT and the bagels always come with so much cream cheese that I have to scrap some off. Seriously, and those aren't bad complaints, im just picky.   The service is always outstanding and fast! I never have to wait more then 3 minutes to get my hot drink and bagel in my hand.  Keep up the good work!

How freaken AWESOME is this place!?!??!   Ladmo our Shih Tzu was in need of a bath. We usually tackle this task at home or take him to Petsmart. Our bathroom tub is draining slow (most likely due to washing him at home, and it was Christmas eve, so there was no way of getting him a same day appointment at Petsmart)   Enter Wag n" Wash. I remember seeing this place every time I would cruise the Melrose District but never stopped in. Boy Am I so glad we went in!   It was crowded when we got there, we had to park about a block away and walk over. The store was packed, but we were greeted promptly. We told them it was our first time and we were here for a wash. They said it would be a bit of a wait, but no less then a minute went by and they called our name to go back to the washroom.   We actually had FUN washing our dog. We did the middle package (I think it was $15, which included our choice of shampoo (We went with a whitening brightener since ladmo has a lot of white fur), conditioner, leave in conditioner AND doggie cologne! One of the staff came over and gave us the run down.   Any time we had a question there was a staff member with in arms reach to ask.   The blow drying also went reallllly well. Usually at home, when we get to the blow drying part, Ladmo losses his mind and turns into what closely resembles the Tasmanian devil...whipping about and biting us. At Wag n Wash he was calm, in fact I think he may have liked it.   I will for sure give their grooming services a shot and see how that goes.   The store itself has tons of great products for dogs and cats. Our cats went nuts over the organic catnip toys! Ladmo loves the training treats from the bakery area.   So thankful for a place like Wag N' Wash!

If you like hunting and sifting then this place is for you! It is jam packed with all kinds of stuff!   There is room upon room, there is even a crazy room full of every kind of old window imaginable!   Beware there is no A/C, at least it felt like that this past Tuesday when the high was 109, but they do have a ton of fans on all over the place. Also I wouldn't wear white, its a bit dusty.   the one thing I found didn't have a price tag on it and neither of the employees could tell me how much it was, one said $45 the other said $60+, they said if I waited they'd call the owner, but I was on a tight schedule. Oh well, I might go back and see if its priced.   My aunt found a few things in there she couldn't live with out.   Cool place to spend a day searching for old relics.

5 of us went to the Cork'n Cleaver on New Years Day. We had a reservation.  When we arrived we were seated promptly....at the very very back of the restaurant in a room where no other people were sitting. I'm not sure if it was because we are "young" (all in our 30's)... we were dressed dressy casual, all the guys had a button up or Polo on. Not sure what the seclusion was for.   We were seated, a girl came by for our drink order. When our waiter finally came over he handed us a meat cleaver! The menu is actually on a huge "knife". That sucker was heavy. I told him that it was all of our first times being there. He just said ok. Really? No informing us of the place. No welcome. Nothing. I was less then impressed.  We all finally ordered, the cool thing is you get a side and a trip to the salad bar for the cost of your meal. Prices there ranged between about $29-45. Ruth's Chris prices but they included a side and salad so its a good deal. They brag about the large salad bar, and while yes it is large, and I thought the chilled metal plates where neat, the salad bar was not impressive. The cucumbers and carrots were in realllly thick slices, not one bite or manageable slices. They also had caviar and anchovies on the bar....along with gummy bears and some sort of ambrosia grandma looking concoction. Pretty random selection.  The dinners arrived, 3 people all ordered the prime rib and all ordered it medium and with a baked potato...hard to mess up right? Wrong, they brought out some rice to one of them? My friend and I both got the New York strip. I was less then impressed. For $39 I expected a lot better cut and the way it was cooked just wasn't great. I asked for medium well, There was no pink at all.   Overall for the price you get a ton of food...but is that always best?  I don't see us going back. It wasn't terrible, but not impressive in the least. The services was very lacking.

My birthday was this past Saturday. I wanted a place that's low key and has a good mellow vibe.   I've been to the Lost Leaf a few times, and I love the homey feel it has.   We scored the front room that had a table and a tiny bar pushed against the wall, it was cozy for the 10 or so of us that were there.   They have a great beer and wine selection. They had a live band playing but not sure who it was, all I know is they murdered one of my favorite cure songs. Also there was no cover to get in even though they had live music, so that's cool.   The place was hopping but never felt like it was to busy, we got our drinks nice and quick and never had to wait. The Lost Leaf is one of those nice hidden gems in the valley.

Pretty cute place!   I had never heard of it until a friend invited us to join him for a show.   The seating is awesome, not a bad seat! Though the seating is a bit cramped (ie. not tall person friendly).  The production we went and saw was Little Shop of Horrors, it was not that good, we left during intermission.   I would be game for seeing something else here, I liked how intimate it was.

Ive been to Zoe's a few times in the past, but this review is about their catering.   My mother in law has us over for dinner last night, but didn't want to cook, so she placed an order with Zoe's and dinner was made!   We had a Greek salad which was HUGE! Fresh and tasty! One drawback however, they forgot to give us the salad dressing, no worries though, we whipped up our own.   Next up the rice pilaf, it was pretty good. Maybe a tad over cooked, but the flavor was good.   Lastly, the chicken kabobs! HOLY YUM! They were cooked perfectly. I don't like tomato's in the slightest, but I went ahead and tried one from the kabob and proceeded to eat 4 more tomato's, these things were insanely amazing!   Good job Zoe's, thanks for making dinner a snap! :)

ONE STAR. That's right.   The one star is NOT for the donuts or the coffee...because it RULES! The one star is for the terrible terrible TERRIBLE service that I receive every.Single.Time.I go here.   This location is right down the street from my house and is on my way to work. So I stop in at least once a week. I only go here because its the only DD near my house and on my route to work. That's it.   Every time I place an order they cut me off while I am still talking. I order a medium skim milk latte with hazelnut and one splenda. I will start to stay medium latte and they cut me off, "do you want it hot" yes a hot latte with skim milk annnd..."Do you want any flavor in it?"...yes I was just trying to say with hazelnut annnd.."Do you want any sweetner?"...gah,,,yes with one splenda.   If they would just SHUT UP AND LISTEN I would answer all their questions in my order. I don't talk slow or with a speech impediment, so its not like these questions need to be drawn out of me, I am literally speaking and they are talking over me. I HATE THAT.   Then you get to the window. They give me my drink, And I also always get a french crueler (LOVE THEM). They never ever give you a napkin. I had no idea there was a shortage of napkins. I always have to ask (more like shout, as the girl is always walking away from the window before I can barely grab the bag from her) They act as if I am putting them out by asking for a napkin.   And if you get an iced drink...you have to ask for a straw. WTH Dunkin D!?!!?   My latte is always perfect and my french crueler is always a dream...but the service here is lacking in so many ways its frustrating.   Please step it up Dunkin Donuts.

So I swing through old Dunkin D this morning...Its Friday and I need a french crueler damn it!   This time I tricked them so they couldn't cut me off..I ordered a Hot, Medium 1 splenda with hazelnut latte! HAHA! Try to cut me off and ask me a question now bitches!   I pull up to the window and the guy working it has a name badge that says he is the store manager...I think, rad! He will do everything correctly.   Nope...Handed me my donut and my drink and started walking away.   I say "Excuse me", he still has his back to me, Then I lean out the window..."EXCUSE ME!!" He looks blankly at me...Ummmm Napkin???   Seriously...I don't know if they train these people NOT to give out napkins at the drive through or what. But its frustrating.   My french crueler and latte were heaven as usual. Maybe one day they will get bumped up to 3 stars if they ever give me a napkin without being prompted or giving me attitude when they hand it to me.

I wasn't very impressed with it at all.  All the renovations are nice, and it was nice to be able to sit and have a beer while I watched the movie but everything else sucked.  The service sucked.  The food sucked. The as to the service, they take your order on a little ipad sort of thing, each person is assigned a seat number...I don't believe they actually record the seat down as the waitress continually brought everything to me. other peoples food and drinks...and checks! Ugh. ALSO she brought my 15 year old cousin a BEER! WTF! We all received our food at the same time, except for my husband...he had ordered a burger and for some reason it took a good 15 minutes to arrive.  Drink service was quick.  The food itself was sub-par. I got chicken tenders. They did not have the taste or texture of chicken. they were really weird.   I would say save your money and don't order dinner here. We will be back, but will only do drinks and light snacks.

I hate to give any Pita Jungle 1 star, I loooooooooove pita jungle!  But this place deserves it.   I went here last Saturday with my sister and a friend.   Our waitress was quick to take our drink order. At that time we placed an order for some hummus to snack on while we waited as they were super busy. Our drinks were delivered, but no hummus...we figure it will be out any moment....10 minutes go by and some other person comes to our table with our lunch order sans hummus...The waitress shows up and we ask if we could still have the hummus we ordered, she acted as if we just asked her to do something out side of her job description. Then my sister and I dig into our food, we both ordered the same exact thing and we both asked for chicken in our salads, neither of our salads had chicken. When we brought this to our waitresses attention she got all mad and huffed and puffed and we just told her to make sure we didn't get charged for the chicken as we didn't receive it.   She really sucked. Every time she came to our table she acted like a big bitch.   The waitress that was waiting on the section next to us was dressed in an outfit that was so ridiculous. Tank top, cowboy boots and shorts that were SO SHORT you could seriously almost see her lady parts.   This is not an over exaggeration, I don't even own bathing suits that short. This chick could have hit up the beach for a tan and not gotten any tan lines, that's how short these shorts were. She was barley covered and I was thankful she was not our waitress as I didn't want any rouge hairs in my meal. I can not believe that the PJ allows their wait staff to dress however they want with out any set reasonable guidelines.   THe food was awesome, the experience...not so much.

Well I was thinking to myself last night that I would be giving this location a 3.   HOWEVER, that just went down the drain. Last night the hubs and I ate dinner here. I am currently on this strict vegan diet, so I asked the waiter if the black bean burger was vegan. He said he wasn't sure but that he would check. A minute later he comes back and says yes it is. SCORE! I eat half of it and boxed up the rest for lunch, which I will no longer be able to eat BECAUSE THE DAMN BURGER IS NOT VEGAN! I went on PJ's website this morning to find out calories and what not, because I track that stuff, they had a whole section listing what is vegan and what is not,and sure as shit, the black bean burger was listed on their site as NOT being vegan...why the staff doesn't have access to this info I do not know.   So anyway.....Our actual experience was ok. This time around all the employees were actually dressed and no goods were hanging out. Our waiter sucked. He never checked on us once the food came, never came to give us refills, our plates were cleared away by someone else, a box was brought to me by someone else, we had our credit card sitting on the table for a good ten minutes waiting for the bill. They did get a wee bit busy, but they seriously had about 6 people working that night for that very small location.   I'm not sure what is up with this location. It has always been like pulling teeth to get decent service there. The food is always good but the service is lacking.

OK so, you know the drill, Hubs was hungry and I haven't gone grocery shopping in like two weeks. Give me a break my cat died and work has been hell. So. My husband is hungry, its Friday night, and I am a bad wife as there is nothing to eat aside from some Frito's and some 1 week old cupcakes from my sister in laws wedding in L.A.   My go to Chinese place is closed for the month of October, shit, I tell him some of my Fav Yelpers have yelped about this place and it is minutes from our house. Off we go.   As we park, I remind myself what others have yelped, don't let the appearance scare you off. We walk in and there is only one other couple in the place. A lady meets us at the door and tells us to sit wherever.   We find ourselves at a table by the window. The table cloth is stained, the floors are beyond dirty. I keep chanting the food will be amazing.   First up, the corn egg drop soup. I liked it a lot, it had a subtle pepper taste to it.   Next up the Crab puffs with a dipping sauce that I wasn't totally sure what it was. Usually you get a sweet and sour sauce with crab puffs. The sauce they served was fruity, I thought it tasted like fruity pebbles. It was good whatever it was.   Next out were the entrees. I played it safe and went with Orange Chicken, hubs went with Shrimp in Lobster sauce. We ate it ALL! Every thing was perfect!   Lastly came the egg rolls. She had forgotten we had ordered them so we had to remind her. I was unaware that egg rolls even existed in that size! They were like mini burritos! HUGE! They were made fresh right on the spot and were stuffed to the gills with chicken, shrimp and all kinds of tasty veggies!   If appearance matters to you, then this is not your place.  If amazing, fresh, cheap, fast Chinese food is for you, then Wahsun is for you!

Wow.  Never thought the day would come when I would review a Golden Corral.  However this past glorious Sunday my WT family, when told they could pick ANYWHERE they wanted to go for lunch, no need to worry about the tab, they picked the GC.   This was my first experience with this place. I've only done buffets in Vegas.   Currently my doctor has me on a strict Vegan diet, so I already knew I was in for it with selection food wise.   I was excited to see the spinach and green beans, and then disappointed when I saw they were loaded with ham or bacon. Wah wah.   I had some very water logged Brussels sprouts. Some steamed carrots. Pears and beets that for sure came out of a can. Some french fries and a wheat roll.   When Our waitress sat us, I asked her if any of the rolls were vegan. I got a blank stare and then the "I don't know what you are talking about" response. I explained to her what vegan was, she then pointed to the bakery area and told me I would have to flag down one of the bakers if I wanted to know what was in the rolls. So I did, and the baker was very friendly and pointed out to options I could have. Score!   Our waitress was really very friendly and came by the table often.   This was for sure not a place for me. Its all institutional food, boiled and over cooked beyond belief.

I was in here this past Sunday for some issues I was having.   Everyone from the front desk to the nurses and doctors were just fantastic!   They really took their time with me. Explained what was going on. And were just really very friendly.   If I ever have a need to go to a hospital again (hopefully not) I wouldn't hesitate to go here.

Seriously sooo much fun!  I went to the rock for the first time this past Saturday for a baccalaureate party. I had SUCH a blast! The drag queens looked amazing and were soooo funny! Loved how much they interacted with the audience. Be sure to bring some dollar bills with you to tip them ;)  The wait staff was pretty quick and attentive even with a packed house.  I cant wait to go back!

Dear Chick Fil A  Thank you for providing a bountiful lunch today.  I heart dipping my waffle fries in your honey.  Your 3 piece chicken strip meal can **almost** do no wrong. While I appreciate your use of real chicken, I do not really appreciate the greasy chicken glaze you leave on my fingers when I feast upon you.  I appreciate you for having diet Dr. Pepper and bunny turd ice!  Also, though I did not get the cole slaw today, it must be acknowledged! I am picky about my slaw, and yours is damn tasty!  So thank you chick fil a! You are minutes away from my work and saved me from starving at my desk today!

We had as best experience as you can when you are in an emergency situation with your pet.  Our dog had been neutered on a Monday in December at a vets office, he had a retracted testical, so there was more surgery invovled then the normal neutering. I stayed home monday with him, the hubs stayed home tuesday with him. We had a cone on his head...Thursday we came home from work to find he had manuvered around the cone and had licked his stitches OPEN...it was bad. The vet was closed, and I had remember seeing the Emergency Animal hospital...so off we went. It was about 6pm.  They took the pup and said to wait or come back in 45 minutes so they could inspect him. After 45 minutes we got some bad news... the pup had licked it to the point that there was dead tissue and a raging infection. And it was going to cost close to $1,000. ::gulp::  They did say they could clean out the infection and stitch him up and we could take him to the vet the next day, but we didnt want to risk things getting worse just to save a few bucks. So he stayed there, over night.   The staff was really great (aside from the very unfriendly older receptionist) I called and check in on him at 11 pm and then again at 7am. Once we had him home I probably called the hospital AT LEAST 5-8 times asking random questions and they were always more then happy to answer them.   Pup had to have 2 drains put in, dead tissue and muscle removed, a ton of stitches...it was a tough 2 weeks of recovery...but he is back to his sassy puppy self.

So the pool store we had been going to closed. Bummer.   Fortunately we remembered this place was right up the street from our house!   Its super old school in there. Nothing fancy, but they have all the chemicals you could need and they also work on your pool pumps and vacuums right there so that's handy!   Our pool developed the black algae :( We took in pictures and a sample of our water and they set us straight. Black algae was wiped out and pool is back to new!   We will definitely be making this our new pool go to place.

This may very well be the scariest Walgreen's in all of existence!   Lets set the scene. Its Saturday night at about 10pm. My sister and I are having a yard sale bright and early the next morning...The hubs and I run out of stickers to price our sweet items.   Off to Walgreen's we go.   I cant even begin to describe the clientele. They could have rivaled ANY of the people that you see on Peopleofwalmart.com FOR FREAKEN SERIOUS.   The place was a shambles and there were seriously about 10 people in front of us in line.   Its dirty, its scary, I will not be going in there again. I will take my chances at a Walmart next time, at least there I know what to expect!

I loooooove this spa!!!   I went this past Sunday, for the second time ever and had such a lovely experience. My husband set me up for an hour long Swedish massage and for the Orange Blossom Royal Manicure. Both technicians I had, I believe Tara for the massage and Lana for the manicure were just amazing. Very professional and fantastic at their jobs.   The spa itself is a very relaxing environment. One complaint, I am not a fan of how the locker room faces into the waiting room area, you know, for when you are getting changed??  Not very private. Love the steam room and Jacuzzi.   One negative, the front desk staff messed up big time. My husband had originally booked these treatments as a surprise for my first mothers day, left his name and number for them to contact...well, since I had been there before, they didn't read the notes and called and left a voice mail to remind me of my spa treatments...which my husband had not told me about as they were to be a surprise. So he was wayyy bummed out, since it was my first mothers day and the gift had been "Ruined". I will say though that even though the surprise was ruined, I enjoyed myself very much and the spa manager stepped up and did a great job making things "right". Hopefully they will speak to the staff about attention to detail.   I seriously can not wait to go back. Next time I want to try out one of the Watsu aquatic massages, sounds so amazing.

aaaaaaaaaaack!   I just stopped by here for a slice and salad combo. I hadnt been in for a couple years, and man things have changed.  first up was the salad. I was so psyched on life when I saw how huge it was! One bite and I quickly knew I wouldnt be eating much more. I got the ceasar salad and the dressing tasted "off", the salad itself was pretty warm. Not a welcoming salad at all.   Then came the pizza. The pizza here used to be really good. Not so much anymore. It was all dried out and crusty.   I tossed my lunch and am thankful I had an apple squirrled away in the fridge. $8 down the drain.

This is the DQ the hubs and I roll through. There is one much closer to our house, but it doesn't have a drive through, and generally when i want DQ I am already in my PJ's and not looking so presentable.   So we drive a tiny bit further for the luxury of staying in the car.   So, we roll through last week. They were busy, but the line moved fast. We get to the window and the girl is all out of sorts and mumbling stuff we don't know what she is saying. She goes to get our ice cream and almost gets into a fight with one of her fellow coworkers. She comes back to the window and looks all sorts of stabby. We get our blizzards and split!   The ice cream is always good. They have messed up our order a few times, and the people that work there generally scare me. But I love ice cream and will get my fix any way I can

No reviews for Love Carpet yet?   I have had them out to my house twice this year and have been satisfied both times.   They are always on time and sometimes even early, but never late!   They do the job quickly and efficiently. My gross super old carpet looks pretty dang good when they leave.   The tech was courteous and not creepy in the least.

What a cute little place to have breakfast!  I just recently attended a bridal shower brunch here and it was so cute!   The food was super tasty, I had the creamy corn porridge with maple glazed sausage and cinnamon sugar roasted apples. I took a chance on it, it sounded like it had a 50/50 chance of being either really good or really heinous! And boy was I glad when it came out and was soooo good!  This place could be 5 stars if the staff wasn't so lax and a little more attentive. This was the whole table (8 ladies) first time coming to this place, we were not instructed that drinks were self serves for the basics (water, coffee, juice) we had to figure that out on our own, and no one at our table was asked if they would like a mimosa or any other drink other then the self serve stuff.  I do look forward to going back!

Such a cute shop! The staff is always super duper friendly!!   They have an amazing inventory, great finds for gifts and some antiques.   The upstairs is now a cute little clothing boutique and there was a sweet little dog when I visited!  The prices are more on the higher end, but the itmes here are all cleaned up and refurbished, so if you are looking for something old but looks semi new then this is a great place to start your hunt.   For sure hit this place up around the holidays, there are always cute items to be bought!

Hello BB!!!! I think I love you!   I found out about Bountiful Baskets a couple weeks ago. Last week I was able to participate!   We got sooo much amazingly tasty fruits and veggies! I am STILL working on getting it all eaten up!   The 8:15 a.m. pick up is a bit of a killer, but I can get past that for a wonderful basket full of tastiness.   Keep up the good work BB!!!!

Oh man! I can't believe I hadnt reviewed this place yet!   We went here for the hubs bday last month. My boss is a big foodie and I asked him what his top 5 fav restaurants in Phx/Scottsdale were and Roka was on that list. So the hubs, his parents and I went.   We had reservations to sit at the grill bar so we could watch all the action.   Roka Akor has been named one of the top 10 places to get sushi in the country by Bon Appetit...I DO NOT eat sushi...Ive tried it at RA, ShoGun and Kona grill...I just do not like sushi. BUT I thought, if this place has "the best" I should at least try it here....OMG!!!!! I LOVE SUSHI! At least I love Roka's sushi! I tried the Crispy Prawn Maki Roll (it was heaven), Roka's signature soft shell crab maki roll (Divine) and something else that I cant remember because I was beginning to put myself into a sushi coma.   Who would have thought I liked sushi. Not me.   You MUST MUST MUST try the BBQ Rice skewer! It was the bomb-nonny.   I was the driver so I didnt get to have any real drinks, but I did have a sip of the three different Shochu's the hubs ordered and all were amazing! They had a really tasty non alcoholic drink that had ginger in it that I ordered and it was bubbly and tasty!   For 4 people I think our bill was around $300...but we ordered a TON of food and a TON of drinks (well they did, not me)   Its a great first date or special occasion type of place, a little pricey for an every day dinner kind of night.

Over Easy is just not very good.   I was excited to add a new breakfast spot to my rotation, sadly this will not be one of them.   Let me start by saying, I gave this place 2 chances. I always go back if I had bad service/food the first time, in case it was a fluke.   1st visit, we wait for 30 or so minutes (there were only 2 of us). We get seated at the counter, where we were promptly ignored. They were jamming busy, We finally flagged down someone after a good 10 minutes of watching people go past us. We order drinks and our food.   I see a 4 top get seated well after us. Well after we ordered our food. Not only do they get their food wayyy before us, BUT THEY FINISHED EATING before our food ever came to us!!! Not cool, at all.   2nd time we go back, we get seated on the covered outside patio. I was worried it would be to hot, but they have fans and it does a good job of keeping it cooled down in the hot summers. This time, same freaken situation. People being served way after we had ordered/been seated.   The hubs and I are always easy people to wait on. We are very easy going and understand how things go in restaurants as we have both worked in them before. I don't know who does the hiring or running of things over there, but WOW.   Wont be going back here again.   p.s. I guess i never spoke about the food. The 1st visit I ordered a waffle. since we sat at the bar, we could watch things being made. After the 3rd attempt of making my waffle, it was placed on a plate and sat under the warmer for a good 20 minutes or so. Which Had I known that was my waffle, I would have just walked back in the kitchen and grabbed it myself. The Husband ordered an omelet which should have been easy to make and have come up at the same time or near when my waffle did. No such luck.    The second time I ordered their signature Over Easy dish...I thought I was going to black out, it was soooo soggy and so just flat out disgusting that I went home hungry :(

So the hubs and I decided to stop in here last night. We live fairly close by and had never been, though we drive past it a fair amount, we've just never stopped in.   So we slide on in around 6:30 or so and are promptly greeted and told we can take a seat where ever we want. We chose to sit at one of the big round tables on top of a barrel! The place is very much what I would expect an Irish pub to look like. Lots of dark heavy wood that puts off a real welcoming vibe.   Our waiter Joey was outstanding! He was so friendly and helpful!   Now, lets get serious and talk about what matters most, THE FOOD! They were having a half price apps special so we ordered up some crab cakes and wings. The crab cakes were really great! The hubs chowed down on the wings and seemed to really enjoy them.   For entrees I ordered the fish and chips. Seriously, WHOA! Might be some of the best fish and chips I've ever had! The huge portion of cod was cooked perfectly! The batter was just right, not to heavy, just right. The chips were great, skin on hand cut fries, seasoned to perfection!   The hubs had the flat iron steak sandwich. Its served on a crusty bread, which the hubs was not a fan of. He said the steak had a good flavor to it but would probably order something different next time.   We really had a nice time here. A man was in the back singing and playing guitar. We will for sure be coming back here!

I am taking a star away sadly :(   We went in this past Monday. I order my usual, a Stella. I am told they no longer have that on tap and wasnt offered a bottle, so I am not sure if they carry it anymore.  :( This makes kiki a sad lady.   We were starving so we started with an app. We waited over 20-30 minutes for our app to come out. The place wasnt busy at all and there were multiple waitresses. We actually had forgotten we ordered the app when it did finally come out.   It took another 20 minutes for our order to come out. Not sure what was going on there.   The food was just as fantastic as always!

I loooooooooooooove me some Hissyfits!!!   I've been shopping here for years, even though I JUST had a baby 3 months ago! I have lots of Little's in my life and know that if I want to find something cool and unique, that HF is where to go! I think their pricing is spot on and you can really score some great items!   Twice a year they do something called The Hullabaloo, where they bring in tons of amazing crafters (mostly moms) who sell THE MOST amazing items ever! I did a ton of my Christmas shopping at their fall event and all the kids I shopped for loved what they got. I missed the spring event, so I am chomping at the bit for this years fall Hullabaloo!   And on a side note, the owner is FANTASTIC! I am pretty sure all the negative reviewers have sticks up their asses because I have never had one bad experience here!

Best money ever spent!   They arrived right on time and got straight to work!   They had us out of our old house and into our new house in under 4 hours! AMAZING!   Nothing was broken, scratched or harmed.   We just bought our first home, so we wont be moving for a long time, but I will be highly recommending these guys to anyone who asks for a mover!

So last Monday the hubs and I got invited out to join some friends for $3 burgers at Maizies ($4 if you add cheese)  For 4 burgers (All with cheese on them) and 4 beers our total bill was only $30!!!!!!!! That is a smoking deal if I ever did see one!   Our burgers came out fast and hot. They serve them on chibata bread! They give you a little side of chipotle mayo that is delicious, but not enough to cover a burger.   Our waiter was super fast and friendly! We will for sure be going back

oooooooooh man am I SO GLAD this place isn't near my house, I would gain 20 pounds in no time!   My sister took me here for the first time a couple weeks ago and my mind was blown by all the unique flavors they served!   The shop itself is very cute and modern. I like that they have a section in the back with a bunch of board games, very cool.   As for the ice cream I got the dutch chocolate and the horchata. The horchata was so so good, I cant stop thinking about it!   The following week I took the husband there. Again the ice cream was very good but the service was terrible. It was an older lady behind the counter and she really couldn't care less that we were standing there. She let me sample an ice cream and then I just stood there for a good 5 minutes while she did other things behind the counter. We did finally get served but my husband wasn't impressed with the serves one bit. This time I got my ice cream in a waffle cone, the cone was so light and airy, I loved it!

This is my go to spot for grocery and other household needs. Its on my way home from work, so its easy for me to swoop in and grab what I need.   I love their archers farm brand of products! I haven't been disappointed yet!   The staff is always super friendly and helpful! I also fill my prescriptions here and they have always been great!   Last night I went in for some groceries and went through Ellen's check out line. Seriously, nicest lady I have ever met. She was soooo sweet, so friendly and just a real pleasure to talk to. I was sad when I had to pay and leave, could have chatted with her all night.

The hubs strained his neck and was in need of a massage...and I decided to take advantage of that and get a massage for myself as well.   This was both of our first time going to a Massage Envy.   We both had a great experience. My masseuse was David and he did such a great job, I was really relaxed when we left.   The one thing I didn't like was the hard sale at the end when you are checking out, I understand that's what they are supposed to do but I wasn't a fan.   All in all it was a great experience and if we are in need of some cheap and easy to get into massages we will for sure go here again.

So after tasting this place at the Yelp Science Center party I KNEW I had to go check this place out! I had never even heard of a Pupusas until that fateful Yelp night.   The hubs and I rolled in about 7:30ish. We were the only ones in the place aside from the waiter and the cook. We took a seat and the waiter came on over with menus in hand. He was really helpful, I told him I didn't know what I had at the yelp party but I wanted it again. I had the shredded beef, bean and cheese pupusas. So tasty.   The hubs and I also split an order of the potato and cheese puff things. It was like a deep fried mashed potato missile! So crunchy on the out side yet so fluffy on the inside.   Hubs got 3 pupusas, two shrimp and a steak. I sampled the steak and it was pretty bomb! He went nuts over the shrimp, but I skipped trying it out, wasn't in the shrimp frame of mind. The one thing I wasn't a total fan of was the coleslaw, it has a very vinegary, dill, I don't know what kind of taste. I am VERY finicky with my coleslaw though, hubs said he liked it.   The restaurant itself is nothing to write home about. Its olllllld. The tables and chairs are from the late 80's and worn. There was some rad gangsta rap playing over the speakers and Bones reruns on the tv, but when I noticed the time and asked if they could switch the tv to american idol (yes I am a nerd) He gladly did so and turned down the rap. Pretty rad.   So for an iced tea, a total of four pupusas and some tasty deep fried potato puff guys, the bill was only $13.99 (with the coupon they gave out at the yelp event). We left very full.

I have given this place three chances. Why I will never know. Each time has been unpleasant   Its close to my work and today I wanted a salad for lunch. There were only 3 tables of people, all already enjoying (I think) their salads. So I think it will go fast and I order one to go. 10-15 minutes later I finally get it. No clue why ti took that long. Seriously.   So here I sit at my desk, trying to choke down the most disgusting salad I have ever come upon. Wendy's makes better salads then this place! I ordered a BBQ Chicken Salad. The chicken is actually grey in color, GREY, so I have picked around all of it. The salad is really soggy and I have no idea what the dressing is, but its wrong! Just Wrong! I'm starving and now out the $9.50 I paid for this bowl of nasty :( I feel like a sucker.   Also they asked me if I wanted a roll. I said yes....never got it ;( Thanks for ruining my lunch Tossed.

True Foods is truely yummy!   I FINALLY went here last night after hearing from tons of friends how great this place was. Love the way it is designed! I seriously want one of those huge wood tables in my house, and reallllly had to stop my self from rolling off with one of those cute planters!   We started off with some hummus. It was mighty tasty, but just like other restaurants that serve hummus ::cough cough pitajungle:: they never give you enough pits for all the hummus. I loved the addition of onions and olive and cucumber to the mix.   I also had the "soda" of the day. A strawberry rhubarb concoction. It was very refreshing.   For dinner I had the farmers market salad. Sooooo good! So Fresh! loved the peas and asparagus pieces in it.   For dessert we split the strawberry rhubarb crisp! I didnt even feel bad about getting dessert, it was so light and fresh!   I will for sure be going back here, just wish it was a few bucks less a plate! Also the staff is all really weird and overly overly nice.

There is a reason why Flores A/C doesn't have any reviews under 5 stars.... This is a stand up company with an amazing owner!   My a/c unit suffered major damage after the great hail storm of Oct. '10.   My first call was not to Flores, I called out a company referred to me by a parent of a friend. The tech seemed nice enough. They said the unit was a goner and would need to be replaced and quote me $8900 for a total unit replacement. I know nothing about how much these things cost to replace. I called my insurance company, they said that I didn't need a new unit and that it could be fixed and to find another quote.   I jumped on Yelp, and with in a few reviews knew that Flores would be my company of choice. I called and they came out to my house the same day. Miguel echoed what the first company had said, that it was a total unit replacement and quoted me $4900 HALF of what the first company quoted and I hadn't even told him about the other quote! I called my ins co to relay the info and again they said it had to be fixed and not replaced.   I was stuck in a rock and a hard place until Miguel went out to my house and went onto the roof with my insurance adjuster and showed him how bad the damage was and that the parts were no longer made. That meeting sealed the deal and my insurance company agreed to replace my unit!   Miguel told me that the units were running about a week out to get ordered in, and exactly a week later I called and it had just arrived. The very next day (yesterday) Miguel and his crew was at my house installing my new unit! I had to go to work so I couldn't wait for the full install, Miguel told me he would get everything done that he could do on the roof and meet me back at my house when I got home to do the start up and install my new thermostat inside. Seriously, such accommodating customer service!! He was at my house with in 15 minutes of calling him!   I AM OVER THE MOON that I have found a reliable HONEST air conditioning company. Something that is very important living in the desert. I asked if they did anything else (Some a/c cos do plumbing as well) but sadly they only do a/c and heating work.   Please use Flores A/C! Support the small family owned companies! You will not be disappointed!

I was looking for a nail place on the West side to meet up with some of my cousins, I found Angles and we decided to give them a shot.   5 of us walked in with out appointments (3 pedis, 2 manis) they were able to accommodate us all with in 10-15 minutes of walking in.   Everyone was very happy with how their nails turned out.

My wedding flowers were seriously nothing but AMAZING!   I had a budget and Amanda figured out how to get use of every penny of it! It looked like we spent thousands upon thousands of dollars on our wedding when we didnt at all!   Our wedding was HUGE and Amanda was totally capable of handling our flower load!   Let me break it down for you  35 Centerpieces...yes 35.  NINE bridesmaid bouquets!   NINE groomsmen botineers!   ONE super amazing grooms boutineer! I mentioned to her that my husband loved suculants...and on his wedding day she found a itty bitty one inch big suculant and put it in his boutineer!   ONE bridal bouquet that was simply breath taking!   And dont even get me started on the flower arch for the gazino! It was dripping with flowers!   LOVED Amanda! Loved her work! Loved her creativity! LOVE LOVE LOVE her!

I hate to give such a cute place so few stars.   The hubs and I met up with a couple this past Tuesday, they had heard great things about Floyd's and we are always up for trying something new, so off we went.   When you walk in there is no real hostess, a girl kinda yelled from across the room to sit where ever we wanted. So we did.   We started off with the spinach and artichoke dip. Not one person in our group liked it, in fact we sent it back. It was BEYOND watery and had zero flavor. Very clear that it was frozen spinach that had not been strained.   I ordered the turkey burger. I took two bites and was done. The thickness and texture and taste is all off. I did however get tatter tots as my side and those were damn tasty!   Hubs got the Philly and ate all of it, said he liked it.   One of our friends got the Apple and asparagus salad, she said it was tasty.   The other friend got the shrimp scampi, again a very very watery dish. He ate it because he was hungry and was worried about sending a second dish back. But he complained about it the whole way through.   At the end the waitress brought us out a deep dish cookie on the house for the bad artichoke dip, which was cool of them and it was very good.   The waitress we had was as cute as could be and really nice.   The place is super cute, the patio area outside has a lounge vibe to it and I bet is wonderful at night and in the fall.   I feel like there are way to many items on the menu which is causing lack luster dishes to go out. If they paired down the menu and had more of a focus food wise they could be really good.

Oh WOW!!!!   I've only heard about this place through the reviews on Yelp, and from those alone I KNEW I had to go here!   So the hubs and I set out on Saturday night at about 630ish. We arrived and it was already pretty busy. All the tables were seated and there were people in the lounge area. However the bar was open, and we could be seated immediately, so we snagged a couple stools.   We were hungry and wanted to try a couple things. For starters we got the cheese curds and the fries and gravy. The curds were ok, I would have liked a crunchier batter on them, but they were seasoned very well. the Fries and gravy were the show stopper of the appetizers! herbed parsnips and potato's, Gruyere cheese and THE MOST heavenly mushroom gravy. Seriously soooooo good!   Next up were the shrimp po'boys. They are served on freaken popovers!!!! These little gems were mouth watering! And I really don't eat a whole lot of shrimp, but damn!   Last was the main event. Citrus brined fried chicken and white cheddar cheese waffles! GOOD LORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cant stop thinking about that meal!   We had a couple glasses of wine and some of that house made ginger ale, phenominal!  The bartender/our waitress was soooo friendly, loved her!   The atmosphere was pretty chill.   The location is kinda ghetto...not the building, its beautiful, but its in a neighborhood that's a touch iffy, but whatev, I'll go anywhere for great food!   Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention, they bring a little ball of cookie dough out as a bite of dessert, FOR FREE! Just the right amount after the feast we had!   We will for sure be going back, hopefully the bar will be open, because they were quoting people 45 minute waits all night long and I am sooo not down for that kind of wait.

The Tuck Shop hates your baby.      This past weekend my husband, 2 other couples, myself and our 1 year old attempted to eat at the Tuck Shop. We had told them all how amazing this place was and were jazzed to eat there as it had been a couple years since we had been in.  We got there right at 5 when they opened, as we were around the corner at the PHX Art Museum. We walked in and were promptly greeted. We asked for 6 adults plus a high chair...when we got a dead pan "we don't have high chairs" response.   Tuck Shop you are sending a very loud and clear message that you do not care to serve families. (insert slow clap here)

Went to meet up with some family on the East side of town this weekend. I told them I had some diet restrictions and they suggested Pita Jungle, which I was stoked on as I love me some PJ! I didn't know they had expanded that far east!   It was a Friday night and the place was hopping! We were seated pretty quickly and our waiter was on point all night!   The food came out a tad slow, but it was all great and everyone enjoyed their meals.

I am sooooo glad there is now a PJ much closer to my work! It is all of 7 minutes away.   I had a reallllllllllly bad craving for some Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus so I called in an order to go and added a side order of lentils and rice.   My total bill was $11. That's why its only get 4 stars. The prices seem to keep going up as each new location opens.   Though, for that $11 I got a large order of the most tastiest hummus ever. AND the side order of lentils and rice is so ridiculously large that I have been eating it for 3 days now. I was expecting a cup sized amount, instead it looks to have been at least 4-5 cups worth!   I've gone in to dine here a few times as well and haven't had any issues. Keep it up PJ!

My beloved hairdresser moved to Tucson **sobs in corner**   This place is down the street from me and I needed a haircut and color soooo badly. I've been twice now and have had Becca (Rebeca) do my hair each time. She has done a fantastic job and my $55 hair cut and 2 color jobby gets just as many compliments as it did when I was going to my amazing stylist!!   I will keep going back and will follow Becca to whatever salon she ends up going to whenever she graduates!   NOTE: You can pay via a credit card BUT you cant tip the stylist, so bring cash!

This place has some of the coolest stuff ever!   You have got to check out the outside area out back, AMAZING finds!   Inside the shop you will find all kinds of neat stuff you never knew you needed and a sweet little orange tabby sleeping amongst the treasures.   It does get a bit warm in there during the hot months.

Well, Hello there captain yummy!   The hubs and I met up with the mother & sister in law this past Sunday for brunch. We must have gotten there at the perfect time, 11 a.m., as there was no wait and we were seated quickly. When we left around 11:45 the line to be seated was insanely long.   The food was great! I had the cibatta french toast with a side of bacon and a Bellini to wash it all down. The french toast was just lovely. I generally don't order french toast because its usually to soggy, but not at Postino's! It was a slice of french toast heaven with a super tasty creme sauce and fresh sliced strawberry on top. The bacon was decent, but no Matt's Big Breakfast type of goodness.   Our waitress was on top of things even as the place filled up, our glasses of iced tea never got empty.   We will for sure be checking this place out again!

So the place goes by a couple names, Its also known as Mr. Sushi. So when you are trying to find it, just look for the Marie Calendars, turn into that parking lot and then drive straight back to the little hidden strip mall area. The sign on the building says Akaihana, The sign on the window says Mr. Sushi....A bit confusing.   We got there at about 6pm last night. There were a few tables seated but it was pretty dead. We got seated right away and placed a drink order.   They have a pretty large menu and offer a TON of sushi. We placed our order and had everything in about 20 minute. Pretty fast.   Now, Like I said in my Roka Akor review...I am not a sushi girl, AT ALL. So I ordered the vegetable tempura dinner. It was tasty. I did sneak a couple pieces of sushi to see if I liked it.   The soft shell crab roll was gross. I was not a fan, it had a real fishy flavor to it. ACK!   On the other hand, the tempura fried shrimp roll was YUMMO!   I did not eat the other stuff, there was a spicy tuna roll and some other something that the hubs ordered.   By the time we left (8pm) the place had filled up. It looked like there was only one waitress, but she was running her ass off and doing a good job at keeping everyone happy.   I would go back here if someone said they wanted to go, but its not on my list of must go to places.   Give it a try.

I had dinner here for the first time last night. Its a fun little place. Like super tiny. You will feel like you are at a fancy rave or something, the music pumping through there was horrible. The tables are super close together, I am pretty sure my ass touched the persons head sitting behind me when I tried to get in my seat.   Our waitress was great and on top of things. Food came out at a nice pace.   I dont east sushi so I got a few small items. Started with some Miso soup, super tasty! Then a cucumber salad, it was good but would have loved more onion in it. I also got the tempura vegetables, they were decent but I was bummed that there wasnt any broccoli, also the dipping sauce is a bit salty. Over all though I liked it a lot.  It was a nice little dinner. Would I go back here on my own, probably not. Would I go back here if someone asked me to go with them? Yes.

Meh.  I was really excited to try this place out. I saw that they had ballpark pretzels so I was psyched! When we arrived there were no parking spots, so we had to go across the street to Safeway and walk over. Not that big of a deal.   We were seated right away. I liked that they had big booths and the picnic tables were fun.   Our waitress couldn't have cared less that we were there. We even told her it was our first time there and she didn't even welcome us or tell us anything about the place.  We ordered the ballpark pretzel to start. I wasn't impressed with it at all. Its more bread like, very fluffy, not like a ballpark pretzel in the slightest. The cheese dipping sauce that came with it was underwhelming. Total bum out.  Our meals came pretty quickly. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad, it was good. I liked the dressing and the fact that it was shaved chicken. I really liked the tortilla strips in it (though that's more like for a taco salad?) Overall it was a decent salad, they could use better quality lettuce in it, it seemed to be mostly iceberg.   My husband got the prime dip with a side of onion rings. He said the sandwich was just ok, not terrible but not memorable either. The onion rings were a joke. They had zero taste and honestly tasted like the onion rings that you buy in the freezer section of the grocery store. We each ate one and then he took the rings off his plate and set them off to the side. No one wanted to eat them. I actually asked the waitress if the onion rings were made FRESH, she said yes, I said really because they taste like they came out of the freezer, she said, welllll ummmmm ya I think they are frozen. NOT cool to lie to customers.   My mother in law got the fish and chips. The fish was actually pretty decent, I stole a bite. However, once again frozen run of the mil french fries and the coleslaw was not edible.   When the bill came I noticed they charged us $1 for the horrible onion rings. I told my husband and when the waitress came back he asked her why. As I had said previously, we had told her it was our first time, when she asked him what side he wanted he said he didn't know what they were so she listed them off for him and did not tell us that the onion rings were a "premium" side dish and were extra. Seriously it is only a $1 and we wouldn't have even made a deal out of it if they would have actually been edible. So we asked her if she could take the $1 off as they were terrible and we didnt eat them and we weren't even told they were extra. She sends the manager over, seriously. To take a $1 off. He told us he could take the $1 off or give us a free dessert. We went with the $1 off as we were all ready to get out of this place. He didnt even ask why.  So there you have it. Its a cool looking place, looks like they have a nice patio. The food is underwhelming. For 3 dinners, 2 beers and an app our bill was about $64.   Would I go back here on my own? No. Would I go back here if some one asked me to join them? No.

The hubs and I have been driving by this place for almost 2 years and finally stopped in! This could be dangerous folks!   Bosa Donuts is super tasty! Everything we got was so fresh and just delightful. I sampled ::mumbles:: four donuts and really liked them all.   One negative however....The coffee is the worst. Gas station grade.   So get your donuts here and go elswhere for your coffee needs.

WOW!!!!!!  So glad I went here! My mother in law goes here. My husband was in NEED of a pedicure (When you start referring to the bottom of your souls looking like alligator assholes you know its time for a pedicure) Since I was dragging him to his very first pedicure I figured I would take one for the team and get one as well.   They did such a nice job! I liked how the pedicure chairs were in the back and closed off so you weren't on display to the rest of the shop. It is really nicely decorated in here. The staff is friendly enough, same language barriers as any where else.   We did the works and added the sugar scrub and also did the paraffin wax treatment, all in all with tip for two top of the line pedicures it was $100. Not to bad.   I will for sure be going back! They do gels here and I really want to try those out!

What a beautiful bar!   I went for my first time this past Saturday for Doom Disco. The dj's played amazing jams all night long. The drinks were cheap and the beer selection was pretty fantastic!   The unisex bathroom is really cool looking, but ya, im not totally into that.

So far I have only had the frozen custard...The Pecan turtle concoction to be exact, I would eat 10 if I didnt think my husband would judge me.   We plan to go back and try the burgers!

I've gone back a few times since my last review. Every single experience has been fantastic! The burgers are pretty good, BUT do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin OMFG!!! Sooooo freaken amazing!   Also their onion rings are pretty much perfect!   And the fried cheese curd...just get it! I was a little creeped out eating something called cheese curd, but holy deliciousness!

First off....I am not pregnant nor do I own a child of my own. However my friends keep spitting out babies like there is no tomorrow. So I have been averaging about a gazillion baby showers each month. OI.   I have now gotten to the point that I almost cry tears of joy when a friend registers at Buy Buy Baby. It is seriously the most organized retail store EVER, well next to Bed Bath and Beyond (Which, they are owned by the same company, so the organization thing makes perfect sense)    Usually when I go to a place like Babys R Us and get one of those registry forms printed out, it is a total cluster fluck. I never know where things are, its all over the place, I feel like I am participating in a blindfolded Easter egg hunt. but not at Buy Buy Baby. Holy heck. They print out the registry info and its all organized by each section and each aisle in each section, and guess what, the order in which the registry prints out is the same order in which the store is laid out! Easy peasy!   Thank you buy buy baby for making my baby shopping experiences effortless! Oh and they take the 20% off coupons from Bed Bath and Beyond as well! Double Score!

My sister and I went here on Sunday for spa week.   When we arrived the receptionist asked if it was our first time. My sister had been there before, but I hadn't. All that got me was some paper work to fill out, every other spa I have been to usually gives a little tour of the place.   Luckily we arrived about 15 minutes before our services as there are only TWO chairs inside to wait for your service, everyone who arrived after us, about 5 other girls, had to sit outside, and it was roughly 94 yesterday.   The massage itself was nice. I had Seth and he did a really great job. I told him I liked a lot of pressure and that my back was jacked. He spent a lot of time on my back. the one thing I was sad he didn't do was the head rub and ear lobe pinching, but whatev.   The room we were in was amazing. It had a huge soaking tub, shower and bathroom area. Very nice.   Will I go back? Maybe for spa week...but probably not for a full service treatment.

STILL drooling from my visit this past Saturday!   I attended a baby shower in one of the private rooms. Let me first say that the decor in this place is AMAZING! I want to live in this restaurant! Also the staff was extremely nice and very attentive. Our main waiter was Eric and he took great care of us.   The food was SO GOOD! We had the Kobe sliders, french fries, mac and cheese, the chopped salad and some tasty little rolls that were paired with an herb butter that I am pretty sure was laced with crack, all of it was beyond amazing.   I took home some of the mac and cheese and just ate it for lunch, three days later and its still moist and delicious!   Keep it up! I cant wait to go back and try out the full menu, though I don't know how that's gonna work because I am going to need one of each that I just listed above. Oi.

Seriously. Modern Steak may be my new favorite place to eat.   Ive only been for lunch so far, still need to do dinner there.   Once again Eric was our waiter and he was just amazing and remembered us from the shower we had been to a few months prior.   The food was just beyond perfect!   My one "complaint" the hostesses wear very very short dresses. Like inappropriately short. Other then that this place can do no wrong in my eyes.

For what it is, this place is pretty decent, its like a fast food Italian place, only you sit down. So not really fast food...but its no upscale Italian eatery.   We ordered the artichoke, shrimp and crab dip to start. It should just be called artichoke dip, as the shrimp and crab was very lacking...maybe 5 little bits in there.   I ordered a Mista side salad and it was soooo heavily loaded down with crap, sometimes less is more!   Now, the dinner was pretty tasty! I got the roasted Brussels sprout and pancetta pasta, heavenly!!! Though i wish they would have put MORE Brussels sprouts and less pancetta, but over all pretty decent.   We enjoyed it and will probably go back again.

I had my first waxing experience (other then eyebrows) here last week.   I was nervous as I had never been waxed down south, however the girl I was with was amazing and made it as quick and comfortable as possible.   The place itself is very nice and has a spa like feel to it.   I booked an appointment for another 3 weeks so ya :)

WOW!   The hubs and I were meeting up with a friend and her lad, she suggested TMI and boy am I glad she did!   TMI is a super cute historic house with tons of charm. The staff was extremely friendly and quick. The pricing was very reasonable.   We ordered some olives to start, the citrus on them kinda threw me off a bit, but they were still tasty. For my meal I got the grilled cheese with a side salad. The salad was fresh and light. The grilled cheese freaken RULED! I don't know how I am going to go back to this place and order anything different, seriously folks, this might be the grilled cheese to end all grilled cheese sandwiches.   I cant wait for better weather so we can sit out on their cute patio!

Lord have mercy!!!   We went and checked out the Culinary Dropout (finally) this past Friday for the hubs birthday. We love Fox restaurants and hadn't been to this one yet.   The atmosphere is really cool, kinda loud and totally fun.   Our waitress was the cutest thing ever! She was on top of everything and a real pleasure, I don't remember her name but she had blond and pink hair and looked like a pin up model!   For starters we got the soft pretzel bites with the fondue. Seriously amazing, you will be cheating yourself if you do not order these.   For dinner I got the fried chicken with the honey  drizzle, I loved it, super crunchy! However the mashed potato's that came with were very "gluey", I was not a fan of that.   For dessert we had to order two because we couldn't decide between what to get, and I am glad we did! We were only going to get the peanut butter cup which was super amazing but then at the last minute I also tossed on the Carmel pudding dessert topped with the Carmel popcorn...OH MY GOD...I could eat this every day and never get tired of it!   I am currently pregnant so I couldn't sample any of the cocktails, but the menu for them looked amazing, the husband ordered the crushed Irishmen and said it was very tasty!

So once again I didnt go grocery shopping....I think all of my reviews are starting to sound like this.   The Hubs and I remembered that we have driven by this place many times, but had never stopped in. We are big fans of Lo Lo's so Off Da Hook was really being scrutinized by us.   We both ordered the fried Chicken. The order comes with 2 sides each, I got the greens and yams, Hubs got mac and cheese and potato salad. It also comes with corn bread  The chicken was AMAZING! The breading is very light and fluffy!  The greens were really good, had a great flavor to them!  The Yams were sooo tasty and hot as all hell!  The mac and cheese was OK. I am a big mac and cheese snob though. The hubs liked it...me not so much.  THe potato salad was good. I liked it though it didnt taste homemade or look homemade....it was still good none the less.  The corn bread was really realllllly good  Our waiter was fast and friendly, though he never came back to check on us, and there was only one other couple in the whole place. So that didnt sit to well with me, as I love great service.   All in all its a great place to grab some fried chicken! We will for sure be going back!!

This review makes me sad, but yeah.   So we went back for another go of this place, we love chicken and waffles.   We walk in and are seated. Our server comes over and rattles off a list of about 5 or 6 things they are out of, kinda disappointing. But whatev. We find things we want to eat.   The Mac and cheese tasted like it was 5 days old and had been re-heated and re-heated and re-heated more then it should have.   The corn bread was very lack luster this go around.   AND THEN IT HAPPENED. Something NO restaurant wants to happen. I am eating my chicken breast and half way into it, RAW chicken! I wanted to die and instantly felt sick to my stomach...   The server was very apologetic and did take my meal off the tab, but dang, that was upsetting. It will be a while before the husband can convince me to give this place another chance.

So. After 8 years of owning a Ford, it left me stranded on the road one to many times.   So I bought a '06 Hyundai Elentra (from a different location). Ive never owned a foreign car, this car appealed to me because of the low miles and still had a warranty.   Well....it started to act a little funny. So I called up Discover Hyundai, as they are miles from my work. I spoke to Tim in the service department and he was more then helpful.   They had to keep the car for 2 days, because they couldn't get it to do what I was telling them it was doing...but they were persistent and finally were able to duplicate my issue.   Everything was under my warranty. I was back on the road by the end of day 2!   I will for sure be going back here for all normal maintenance and if any other issues arise. Thanks Tim!

The hubs and I attended the musical Hair at Gammage this past Tuesday (thanks Yelp!). We came straight from work and were in need of some dinner.   This Chipotle happens to be right across the street. Awesometown.   The place was slam packed. There wasn't one free seat inside or out. So we got in line anyway hoping for a place to sit. I told the hubs what I wanted in the event that I saw a table free up so I could swoop in on it. And swoop I did!   Everything was good, as always. It was my first time going to this one, and most likely wont go back considering how ridiculously busy it was, I don't like to have to street fight people for a place to eat my dinner.

This place is adorable in a grandma sort of way!   It is way the heck out there though on Power and McKellips...   I went here yesterday for a bridal shower. Its a tea house and gift shop. The dinning room area for the tea is super cute, old antique tables and chairs, and fine china.   The hostess came out and explained to us the proper way to drink your tea...as it turns out I have zero tea etiquette   The food comes out in courses. First was a mixed fruit bowl. Second was a spinach and sausage keish, then a tower of assorted tea sandwiches and butterscotch scones. All was very tasty.   If I ever find myself needing a fancy tea party fix, I would go back here again.

This place is amazing!  The hubs and I are expecting our first baby and I was told this was the store to register at! I already knew this though, Ive been to many many baby showers and have always loved shopping at Buy Buy Baby over Babies R Us. BBB is organized in a way that makes so much sense.   The man how helped us set up our registry was super informative and very helpful. the staff that we encountered along the way was very friendly and helpful as well, no one was ever pushy.   I see a lot of trips to BBB in our future!

Wow.   I've never felt so unwelcome at an eating establishment ever before.   Last week the hubs and I drive over to his moms house (our old hood). She lives on the same exact block the Vig Uptown resides on. So we walk on over. We are all very excited to try the newbie that just popped up in the neighborhood.   We walk in. Where we stand for FIVE (yes 5) minutes before the person who I am guessing is the host finally wanders on over. He looks us up and down. We say there are 3 of us. He looks at the list and says "Oooooh, ya. We are pretty busy. I don't see you being seated any time soon" we look at each other all baffled....One of us asks, can you give us an estimated time when a table might be available.... he looks around and says..."um, yeah, like I said we are pretty busy"   Oooooooook then. We walk out, cross the street and go eat at the Phoenix City Grill, where they are always happy to see us, seat us and serve us.   Dear Vig, you might think you are all that, but seriously. Get over yourself. The hubs family has lived on that block for 34 years, they have seen restaurants come and go. If you keep up your attitude, you will find yourself pushing your LOCAL customers away.

OI. I reallllly wanted to like this place.   After my last review, one of the owners reached out and emailed me, apologized and asked me to give them another shot. Love how much they care about their customers.  The remodel they have done is AMAZING! I loved the enclosed patio area, so cool, literally, I thought the temp would be horrible back there but it was so nice.   First off, the hostess. Sweetest girl ever! She told us it looked like a 20-25 minutes wait and that we could find a spot on the patio and enjoy a drink while we waited for our table. We lucked out and found a spot, this place was SLAMMING for a Tuesday! A nice waitress in a skirt that ALMOST showed some butt cheek came over and took our order. We were hungry so we ordered some guacamole to tide us over for our "twenty five minute wait". 30 minutes go by and we think that the waitress has totally forgotten about our order. I go up to the hostess to see how much longer we have to go "you are next" she says, Rad! 5 minutes later out comes our gauc, finally. The gauc was decent, we all loved the chips, they were like crack. Another TWENTY minutes goes by, so now we have waited double over what our estimated time of wait was. I really wish she would have been honest with us and just said its going to be a 45 Min- Hour wait. It was CLEAR when she gave us the 20-25 minute wait she was either fudging to keep us there, or had no clue on how to quote a wait for a table. But seriously, sweetest girl ever.   FINALLY we get shown to our table. We are EXCITED. We have been dying to try this place out. Like I mentioned in my first review, the MIL lives in the neighborhood behind the Vig, so we are fans of places we can walk to! The waitress actually cracked a joke about how we probably all know what we wanted to eat since we had waited so long.   The food came out relatively fast....the fries were all warm, but all the sandwiches were luke warm at best. Im pretty sure mine and the hubs were meant to be hot. Our cheese was melty but everything else was room temp/luke warm.   Lets start with mine first, the honey ham & provolone. I took one bite and was astonished by its lack of flavor. It should have been bursting with flavor, it had ham, provolone cheese, grilled pineapple, dijon mayo and a pablono chile! It was flavorless. The only thing that had flavor was the chile that brought mad heat. I tried a few bites with out the chile to get the flavor of the sandwich, zero. I cut off a piece for the hubs and MIL to try to see if it wasn't just me. Nothing. It was a luke warm pile of meat and cheese that tasted like nothing. At least I had some sweet potato fries to munch.   Next up the hubs, He got the uptown steak sandwich, Asked for it medium. It had sliced bistro tenderloin with wild mushrooms, caramelized onions, arugula, roasted red peppers, Swiss cheese and horseradish mayo on a sub roll. First off, they cut the sandwich in half for you which is awesome, but had the chef been paying attention he would have seen the middle ends of the sandwich were verging on RAW (like red)!! So gross. The hubs picked all the raw looking pieces out, took a bite, NO FLAVOR! A sandwich that has roasted red peppers and caramelized onions and horsey mayo should for sure have flavor!?! This was not the case, he cut a piece off for each of us to try. We all looked at each other in disbelief, how could there be no flavor. Really people, this is not an over exaggerated story, I wish it were. He also got onion rings. Now in my family, onion rings get devoured, in fact fights usually occur as to who gets the last ring. We each take an onion ring, now have you ever eaten those fried batter pieces at the bottom of the Long John Silvers fish baskets? Those little clumps of fried batter that have zero taste? Well, that was what these onion rings tasted like, a bunch of fried nothing.   Lastly the MIL's Turkey sandwich. It had turkey breast with dill havarti, cranberry chutney, roasted tomatoes, cole slaw and honey-mustard mayo on pretzel bread. We all swooned at the pretzel bun! This one wasn't as tasteless as mine and the husbands sandwiches. It was ok. She also ordered the regular french fries. Those were good.   I know this review is getting long and winded, but I want to give an honest full run down of why I gave only 2 stars.   Our waitress only came back once to check on us and was never to be seen until the check came. A different waiter came by and asked if we wanted boxes as each of our plates looked completely untouched. We all said no (in unison).   It for sure has a nice happy hour atmosphere and prices. That has got to be a reason why this place was packed both times we have gone (530-6ish). I've never been to the 1st location to compare the two food and service wise. It has tons of potential, and it looks like plenty of people love The Vig, maybe we went on an off night? I'm sorry Vig, you are just not for me.

I went here a couple months ago to grab a bowl of noodles before the Violent Femmes played. The ramen was alright. I ate most of it with out complaint....However, when I got home my stomach was tore up from the floor up. Like, not good.... And then I started reflecting back on the visit. The tables were filthy...we had to push dirty dishes aside just to sit down...they weren't packed by any means, but about 5 un-bused tables, just sitting there with dirty dishes, we needed one of the larger tables to accommodate us.  The bathrooms were equally dirty.  While I liked the noodles, I am not sure if my sickness was from the food, the uncleanliness of the establishment or something totally different. But ya. Not going back.

I dropped in here for the first time this past Friday to attend a private event in the back bar area.   The place is very open and has a very modern and chic feel to it.   The servers were all very friendly and quick to refill peoples drinks.   The food was alright but everything was stone cold which was a bum out. The spinach cheese dip for the chips was so cold it had ceased up and you couldn't dip a chip in there. The soft pretzels were soft and tasty but ice cold. Wah wah.

Hello. I think I love you!   I FINALLY got to try out short leash dogs at the Yelp pleY event!  The corn dogs were probably my favorite! Though the other little bites were just as fantastic! I cant wait to actually eat a meal from this place!   Keep it up! You guys rule!

Pretty cool concept for an accessory store, sections of the store are broken apart by color. Makes shopping soooo much easier!   Super fun to shop in. The store associates are friendly and do not pester you asking if they can help every 5 seconds, so thats a plus.

So I work in the air park and get pretty tired of the selection and the prices.   So I see a place opened up called Jimmy John's. I had no idea what it was, with a name like that I was expecting BBQ or a hot dog place, but this wasn't the case.   It was sub sandwiches. TASTY and cheap sandwiches at that.   So I strolled in there today at lunch rush, I placed my order, I had 2 sammies and a pickle to go. I ask them if they are going to call my name or a order number, the guy at the register says they will call out my sandwich. Ok.   I go over to the pick up area. They call out my first sandwich, and just toss it on the counter, I ask for a bag, a girl behind the counter barks at me to just grab a bag (there is a pile of bags behind the counter with in customers reach) So I grab a bag and bag up my first sandwich. A few other people have now gathered around the pick up area....My next sandwich is called out w/ a pickle. As I go to reach for it another guy reaches for it as well....I almost had to play rock, paper, scissors for my lunch as he had ordered the same exact thing....they REALLLLLLY need to have a better system, like say, call out the order numbers that the register generates right there on the receipt vs. calling out what sandwich is up, just on the slight chance that two people ordered the same exact thing. Lucky for him he was a gentleman and let me take the sandwich and pickle and wait for the next one to come up.   I would have given them 5 stars, but the whole sandwich pick up system is such a cluster f*ck.

Alright...This was my third time going back and I don't think I will be back again, as my ratings keep going down and down.   The hubs and I were near by and hungry. He had never been so I said we should stop by.   We get there, there is one other table of people eating, the place is empty and there are NINE employees working. It did not seem like there was a manager working as what transpired was out of control.   Two male employees are bickering back and forth, LOUDLY...like super loud, we could hear everything that was going on the whole time we were there. I was waiting for fists to fly at any second. You would think if there was a manager on duty, they would have split the two guys up or sent one home early. It was really very uncomfortable. The raised their voices to each other the WHOLE time we were there.   Next an employee walks in with burgers and fries and hot dogs from Five Guys next door. Employees are all hanging around a table eating and talking and really having a great time. I was floored. None seemed to be on a legitimate break as they would hang around the table, eat, go do some work, then come back and talk and eat. No employee looked to be over the age of 18.   We go to bite into our sandwiches and it seems that all the distractions really made for poor sandwich making. I ordered a Vegetarian, I open it up and its missing the sprouts. Hubs orders the Vito, and asks them to put mayo on it instead of the dressing.....they opt to put nothing on it. So we both had to take our sandwiches back up and ask them to fix them.   This was the hubs first time and he never wants to go back there. It was really just not a good experience at all.

Man was I ever disappointed in Rico's. My sister and I had a staycation and stayed at the Pointe, in the morning I suggested we walk over to Rico's. I had been to Rico's once before when Yelp hosted a Christmas party there and the food was sooo tasty so I KNEW the food would be good.  However, this was not the case. The food that came out was extremely beautiful! Plated very nice and we couldn't wait to jump in. I had the Lemony griddle cakes with blueberry compote. The griddle cake had ZERO trace of lemon flavor at all, with a description like "lemony" I was expecting a flavor burst, also they were very spongy and dry. My sister got the rum raisin french toast, again there really wasn't much flavor to it. We were both very disappointed in our breakfasts and for the price it just wasn't worth it.

I took a new route to work this morning and decided to swing through the drive thru for a coffee and french crueler.   The lady on the speaker was soooo friendly and didn't cut me off while I placed my order like my usual DD does.   I got up to the window and was treated with more friendly service.   I knocked them down a star, because just like my usual Dunkin D, this place has napkins on lock down as well and you have to ask for them. They must train them not to give napkins out unless requested. Weird.

OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!   This place doesn't open up yet until 10/25 however my mother-in-law received an invitation from Seasons 52 via her Amex card. The waitress told us that depending on the type of card holder you are you either got invited to lunch or to dinner. We went to dinner, go MIL charging it up with the AMEX!   The restaurant itself is very beautiful, dimly let and romantic. Think Houston's. We sat in a booth in the bar area. The bar is HUGE and had a mini grand piano in it with a girl singing her heart out. She was actually singing the song the hubs and I had our first dance to as we were being seated, its like they freaken were trying to romance us!   Our waitress Megan was great! She was extremely knowledgeable and helped guide us through everything, explaining the wines, telling us about the concept of the restaurant, describing the dishes perfectly. We didn't get to see her too much as they had a full house, but she was by just enough that she never was annoying and we never were in need. Great service!   THE FOOD! Oh man! It was all free with the invite from Amex so we really lived it up! Seasons 52's concept is really awesome. They only serve what is actually IN season and they try to use organic and local whenever possible, so their menu changes quarterly. Also they have a special side menu that changes weekly.   For starters we got one of their flat breads, we chose one off the special side menu, it was artichoke and goats cheese with roasted red peppers. It was totally WOW! The flat bread was sooo thin, yet it held up to the ingredients and stayed crisp. We also ordered their caramelized crab and shrimp stuffed mushrooms, I don't really like mushrooms or shrimp or crab for that matter and I ate TWO of these suckers, they were wonderful.   Next up were the entrees!  I ordered the wood roasted pork tenderloin, it came on a bed of polenta and wilted spinach along with some cremini mushrooms. The pork was cooked perfectly and the polenta was to die for.  Hubs ordered the roasted rack of New Zealand lamb, he said it was fantastic, I don't do lamb, they are to cute so I have no idea how it tasted. He ate the whole thing so it must have been good.  My MIL ordered the mesquite grilled filet mingnon, it was accompanied with baby carrots, asparagus and mashed potato's, I had a taste of all of it and it may be what I order when we go back, it was all over the top delicious!  We also ordered a side of the roasted golden beets with wasabi dipping sauce off the special side menu, I could have eaten these all night long and was kind of sad I had to share. I hope these make it on the special menu more often, they were so simple yet so amazing!   Finally desserts and coffee! I had a regular decaf as it was well passed 8 and I am an old lady and cant have caffeine passed noon. Hubs ordered and espresso and MIL got a latte. All came out piping hot and very good. Then out came the tray of desserts, Seasons 52 has cornered the "mini indulgence" They serve little desserts that are about 3 or 4 bites big. We ordered SIX different ones and had fun trying them all.  We had the Mocha Macciato, Chocolate peanut butter mouse, Pumpkin pie and ginger snap crust, old fashion carrot cake and finally pecan pie with vanilla mouse! They were all ridiculously amazing. My top two if I HAD to only pick two would be the pumpkin and gingersnap crust and the Pecan pie, HEAVENLY!   The pricing here is very fair. Apps are under $8, Entrees are about $11-$26-ish and the desserts are all $2.50!!!!   I can't wait for Seasons 52 to officially open so we can go back!

This is one of two stores now in the valley! The second location is in downtown Scottsdale.   What a fun shop!   I needed something unique for Christmas for my hard to shop for boss.   This place hit the mark.   I picked up a bottle of the blood orange olive oil, a bottle of the pomegranate balsamic vinegar and a black truffle oil for good measure.   The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. the shop is very cute and has a sort of apothecary vibe to it.   I cant wait to go back and shop for myself!

Oh. My. YUM!!!!!  I had a coupon for a free pizza (thanks to a Yelp event) and have never been to this place so we decided to make the drive and check it out. Sooo glad we did!   I wish I would have gotten our waiters name, he would have gotten a 1 star. We were seated and sat and sat and sat. It was a Thursday (5/24) at about 6pm, there were maybe 3 other tables with people. NO ONE acknowledged us for a solid 10 minutes. We finally flagged down a bus boy who went and got our waiter. The waiter was not personable at all. Whatev. Although twice a lady brought our food out to us, she was so super nice and we had even said to her that we wished she was our waitress, very personal and nice.   We ordered several things to try since it was our first time. We did an order of wings, an antipasto salad, the mozzarella and then a pepperoni pizza.  I don't eat wings, so I cant say how they were, but they were the biggest I've ever seen and the guys really liked them a lot!   The antipasto was fresh and tasty! We will for sure be ordering that again. Note a small is big enough for 4 people!   The fried mozzarella was super tasty! Very different! Loved it! Not the best I've had though, that award goes to Lo Cascio, but I will for sure order it every time I go!   The pizza was HUGE! A large will easily feed 5 people. It was so different, loved the amount of cheese on it, though I do wish there was slightly more sauce on it, the sauce is soooo tasty!   This will for sure be a repeat place for us!

Woot!!! So excited to have a In and Out close to the house!   The hubs went by on Friday night and picked up some burgers and fries for dinner! So Yum! Everything always tastes so fresh! I am a huge fan of the fries!   I think its great that they put an In and Out in the location they did, Metro needs some new life breathed into it! Plus its right off the I-17 which makes sense for the long distance travelers to swoop in and grab something to eat.

Can I get a WHAT WHAT!!!!!   Never in all my years did I think I would go to a Cost Cutters and get a PHENOMENAL hair cut. I am a hair snob like that, if I'm not spending $100's then I don't feel like I am getting a good cut. Until this past Friday when I was beyond desperate! I NEEEEEEDED a hair cut, in fact I needed a new look. I was fully prepared to bust out my toe nail clippers and start hacking away.   This place was on my way home from work, they take walk ins or you can make an appointment.   I sat down in Lisa's chair and she got to work. When I walked in my hair was borderline soccer mom. When I walked out I felt like I needed to start a rock band or something! This is one rocking do! My hair has been lagging and really needed some spunk put in it.   And HOLY CHEAP BATMAN! Ive been paying $100's++ for some time now, at Cost Cutters its like $20 for a wash and cut and the color prices were really cheap as well, might have to go back and give them a whirl, they use Paul Mitchell color and products and have all the other fancy and fun hair products that a lot of the top salons carry.   I know people don't like to "cheat" on their stylists but in this economy, do yourself a favor and check them out, you get a great cut for very little moo-la!   And go see Lisa! She is a total gem and said she wouldn't let me walk out of her salon with soccer mom hair! Love that!

So.Freaken.Tasty.  I FINALLY convinced the hubs that even though the parking situation here is bleak (we earned this from going to Churn a few times) that we should give Windsor a shot. Upon pulling up to the valet we learned it was free (Tips only) Woot!   There were 5 of us and we were starved. We ordered 4 apps! We got the pretzel with the cheese dip, it was pretty nom worthy. We also got the corn dog poppers, they were ok, I wish the breading was more dense like the breading at the fair. We also got the chips, pretty dang tasty oh and also the kabobs which were good, nothing amazing but not terrible either.   Next up the food. A friend and I decided to split two items so we could taste test. I got the pulled pork sandwich and he got the burger with the caramelized onions. Both were great though I favor the burger over the pork.   We also had 5 pitchers of STELLA!!!! Stella on tap is pretty rare! So excited about that!   we will for sure be going back to Windsor!

Two words. Pretzel Cone!!!   Seriously people! Holy YUM! I was on the search for a new ice cream place and am sooo glad I found Churn! This is the cutest little shop around.   The shop itself is kinda hard to find, there isnt much signage (Hint its just north of the Circle K. Parking is a nightmare. They do offer valet as its sister (Or maybe cousin) restaurant, Windsor, is right next door but who gets their car valeted for ice cream?? Parking is the only thing from letting this place be a five!   The ice cream was creamy and soooo fresh tasting! They have all sorts of tempting treats, I am for sure getting one of those rice krispie treats next time!   I hope this little shop is here to stay!

Updating my review!   Solid 5 stars!   I found out that the valet is FREE (but you gotta tip) AND there is a little seating area out back! Totally didn't know about that!   So now I can actually park my car and sit and enjoy my treats! woot woot!

Janet was a god send for my wedding! We bought all the bridesmaids dresses well in advance, well months after they were ordered we found out my sister, the MOH would be 6 months pregnant, super exciting but how would she fir in her mermaid dress!?!?! Janet to the rescue, we had a standing appointment for THREE DAYS before my wedding, my sister went in and Janet worked her magic! My sister looked amazing!   I've sent numerous friends to Janet and all have had fantastic experiences. Janet is so friendly, she felt like a long lost aunt or something.   Do not hesitate to use her

For 2 burgers, and order of frys, an order of onion rings and a large drink the bill was only $15. Pretty decent. Its a step above fast food burgers but by no means a gourmet burger. I ordered the burger with pineapple and terriyaki sauce. The pineapple had little flavor, and same with the sauce. Though it wasn't horrible.  The place is very very clean and the staff was extremely nice.   The hubs and I will venture back in here again for sure.

The hubs and I decided to check this place out Friday night.   We loaded up the pup and headed off.   We always roll through drive thrus and go home to eat. The staff there was sooooo friendly! They even gave our dog a little doggy biscuit, how cool is that!   The meal itself was tasty. The breading is like a light crackery crisp yumminess going on. The sauce is great but wish there were other options. The coleslaw was tasty. Hubs went nuts over the bread but I wish it was toasted on both sides. The fries are nothing special, but ok.   We really liked this place a lot and will for sure be back!

Love me some Rita's and will use any excuse to drive 25 minutes out of the way to get it! I've even brought a cooler and ice packs with me to get it home to my family in its frozen glory.  The root beer Italian ice with vanilla custard on it is a totally upgraded root beer float! I havent met a flavor I didnt like here! I thought the cotton candy would be too sweet, nope, delicious! The pear? Sooo refreshing! The cherry....drooooools.

Glad to finally go to a PJ where all the girls are actually CLOTHED! I love me some PJ but always hate going in and having to be subjected to the waitresses in barely there clothing, the girls here are tastefully dressed.   This is for sure the most upscale looking of all the PJ's.   The food was all just as good as it is at the other locations. My only complaint is that I ordered the nachos and they gave me a HUGE portion of chips and almost no cheese or other toppings. Usually the nachos are smothered in toppings so this was disappointing.   I will go back here againl

Yum!  My bosses wife picked up a bunch of pizzas from here last week and brought them into the office. I don't know what all she got but the pieces I tried were very tasty. I loved their sauce and the chewy crust! I snagged a piece of bread that comes with the salads and it was also very good.  Its a pretty far drive from where I live so not sure if I will ever get to have the tastiness of LAMP again, but if I am ever in the area and hungry this will be my spot!

Dear lord! So our company had its Christmas luncheon here last Friday, So glad I got to have this pizza again!   The restaurant itself is small and narrow but very cute and was able to accommodate our group of 12.   For a starter I got the meatballs, and had offered to share them with the people sitting around me. I wish I hadn't, they were Soho tasty!   For a pizza I ordered the Gem and had them add some green olives to it. AMAZING!   MY bosses wife ordered the Kensington and offered to let me try it. I normally don't like white pizza, but it looked interesting with the arugula piled high on it. But ones I bit into it I had a food gasam in my mouth! Under the arugula was FIGS!!! Seriously people, who puts figs on a pizza???? Lamp does, and thank god they do because I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I took the last bite! I will FOR SURE be making the 40+ drive up to this place from my house and dragging my husband along as he HAS to try this pizza!!! Just amazing!

Well, Im finding it really hard to believe all the hype, everyone has been telling me to go to Smashburger, that its amazing.  Well I went. And it was not amazing. I left pissed off that I just $30 something on a couple tasteless burgers and less then spectacular onion strings and a very lumpy shake.   Save your money.

My husband and I have now used the BLT team TWICE and have had nothing but great experiences with them. Rachel, Shannon and their whole team were on the ball and in constant contact with me letting me know where we were in the process and what was coming up next.  Whenever I had a question (and most of them flat our silly) they always answered them quickly and never made me feel dumb for asking questions and always gave me tons of great information so I was well informed.  Our most recent experience just closed last week and we are extremely satisfied by the rate we were given and how our whole loan was handled.   Not only would I use them again for any future mortgage needs I would highly recommend any of my friends and family to use them and only them!

I want to give a shout out to Accent Marble & Granite, especially to Jenni, Michael and Jesus! This team did such a fantastic job!  Jenni & Jesus helped me figure out what granite I was wanting, helped me with choosing an edging style and found sinks for me that were a heck of a lot less then Home Depot and looked just like the fancy Kholer sink I was about to drop a couple hundred on!   Michael came out on time to measure everything and was very quick and efficient. Jesus arrived on time and got to work right away installing our new counters and sinks in both of our bathrooms! They look amazing!   I will FOR SURE being going back to Accent Marble & Granite when its time to do the kitchen! They also carry engineered and solid surface counter tops as well! So they are a one stop shop for sure.   Also it is family owned and operated and I always feel good supporting the small guys!

We finally tried out Five Guys!   I liked how simple the menu was, though I was pretty sad to see that there weren't any milk shakes on the menu.   The amount of fries they give you is obscene! We got one regular and one Cajun style, and between 3 fry loving people still had a PILE left over.   The burgers are made to order with tons of great toppings to choose from. I do wish they would use a bit of a better quality bun, but that is my only real complaint.

Seriously amazing cupcakes!!!   Just the right amount of sweetness with out being too over the top sugary!   Unfortunately for me, The Sweet Tooth Fairy is one block from my office...totally helping me keep this baby weight on.   I've had cookies, cupcakes and cake bites from TSTF and ALL of them have hit the spot. My favorite is the toasted coconut cupcakes, its one serious cupcake!   The shop itself is very pretty and classic, I love all the marble and glass cases.

So if you are one of those girls who isnt really girlie and never really figured out how to style your hair, then this place is for you!!!   Ive been twice now  in the past month and have had great experiences each time! ALSO my hair is very thick and straight and NEVER keeps a curl, well the people working here are masters and my hair stays styled for at least 2-3 days afterward!   I love the atmosphere and just how dang adorable it is in there! I had to use the bathroom yesterday and was such a pretty bathroom, I had bathroom envy big time!   I will for sure keep going back for all my blow out needs!

Soooooooooooooooo amazing!!! I am so pumped that there is finally a legit doughnut shop in the area. The staff is super friendly and pleasant.   There really are no words to describe the doughnuts here. They are all so amazing!   The lemon filled is like a little cloud of heaven. So light!   The french crueler....Holy smokes! I wish I could eat 10 of them!   I stopped in this morning and picked up 3 dozen! Dropped some off at my daughters daycare and took 2 dozen in to work, I was totally the Monday morning hero today! Thank you Northern Perks!

This is one of my favorite go to spots for amazingly unique greeting cards (even some slightly offensive ones ::wink wink::) I could seriously go broke in this place! Love all the cute little gifts they have as well. They have beautiful wrapping paper that is a bit on the pricey side, so its a nice splurge when giving an extra special gift, they will even gift wrap for you!
