This place is my Cheers.  I go in there with the same people all the time and when we walk in the staff greets us with a smile and knows our names and they know what my favorite drink is (whiskey on the rocks).  I don't know what this says about my friends and I and our drinking habits, but it says a lot for the staff.  They make you feel welcome and you feel like part of the Pranksters family.  The drinks are strong and pretty cheap, and they have one of the best reubens around in my opinion.  And the onion rings are killer too.  If you want a bar where you can go to just feel comfortable and have a nice conversation with some friends, or meet some interesting and friendly new people, this is the place.  If you are saying "fuck it...I just wanna dance!" then go somewhere else.

I really tried to give it no stars.  I've lived right down the street from Pete's my entire life and I have to say, after today, this is literally the last place on Earth that I would ever, ever go to eat.    When I pulled up to the drive thru, there was one car in front of me.  By the time I got to the window, it had been ten minutes.  Another five passed before the very unpleasant person in the window even acknowledged my presence.  A couple of minutes after that, I got my food, which I gave a way-too-nice "thank you!" for.  The lady working the window said nothing and slammed the window closed.    That was enough for me to say ok, I will never go back there.  I really don't like bad service and this was the worst.  Especially since I could have been a way bigger bitch about the wait.  At least the people who work at every other fast food chain feign niceness to their customers.   Really I just wanted onion rings, and as soon as I got home I took one look at them and thought "oh, HELL no."  They were the worst I've ever had.  I also got the "superburger,"  which I will assume they named ironically.  I don't know how you mess up a burger that bad, but about an inch of the perimeter of the burger was more or less a fossil.  It was disgusting.  Like, take a burger from Mickey D's, shrink it, remove half of the toppings, and stick it under a 150 watt lightbulb for 3 days.    Look, I know not to expect a 5 star meal from a drive thru window, but this was absolutely absurd.  You could get a better burger literally ANYWHERE else.  As for decent onion rings within a 3 mile radius of my house...the search continues.

I had never been to Old Town Scottsdale as a 21 year old before.  I had no desire to, either, because I assumed it was a bunch of douche bag bars, which is not my scene.  But some of my friends who had also never been to Old Town wanted to go, and somebody suggested Firehouse.  Much to my surprise, it was a bunch of douchebags!! Oh wait, that was not surprising.  I was there for about 20 minutes and was never offered a drink, not that I wanted a drink tying me down to that place anyways.  We left pretty quickly.  I guess if you like loud music, slow service, sloppy drunks, and grinding on Jersey Shore look alikes, you would like this place.  I didn't.
