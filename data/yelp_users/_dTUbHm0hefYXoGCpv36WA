These guys are using Groupon to rip people off. Horrible company. They say its $50 dollars on Groupon to clean your dryer vent and air ducts. Then when they get to your house they say your dryer vent is clogged with out even looking at it, and say the group on does not cover it. (Again not even looking at the dryer vent, no air pressure, no flash lights, nothing, and they know its clogged? What?) They tell me it will cost $180 with no discount at all. What the hell did I buy a coupon for? They also say you have to choose Air Duct or Dryer Vent cleaning. Not both. Even when the groupon say clearly says on it. "Air Duct AND dryer Vent Cleaning." Complete wast of $50 dollars. They are keeping peoples money for doing nothing at all but driving around telling people there is no discount and that there is nothing they can do unless you pay them tons of money. Such a horrible company. I'm so mad.
