My boss invited my to lunch today and we ended up here. I've lived in Arizona most of my life and have driven past hundreds of times but never stopped.   Great bag lunch special for around $5 includes a selection of sausage with a variety of condiments, bag of chips and a can of soda. I went with the jalape√±o cheese and was not disappointed.   You can also stop by and pick up sausage and other meats by the pound. Potato and macaroni salads are also available. Best of all they have pierogi with a number of fillings.   If you haven't stopped, you're missing out.

My wife and received tickets for this show as a perk for staying 3 nights at Mandalay Bay. Our seats were located in the upper section on the left side of the theater but the view was not bad at all. I have read many reviews that say it is actually better to sit in the upper section. I felt the story line itself was fairly easy to follow. The costumes and acrobatics were exactly what I would expect from a Cirque du Soleil show. The thing that amazed me most about this show was the stage itself. I am still trying to wrap my mind around the creativity, engineering and cost that went in to creating something so spectacular. I would recommend this show to anyone who has the opportunity to attend.

Great burgers, friendly staff, unlimited fries and open late. What more could you ask for?

I took my wife to this show expecting to see some great illusions with a touch of Cirque. Instead we witnessed a handful of Mindfreak clips which can be seen for free via youtube and 12 versions of the disappear then reappear somewhere else act. As we left the theater I seriously thought about locating a police officer to report a robbery. I must admit that Criss Angel did a wonderful job of making my money disappear.   If you are set on seeing a show in Vegas I would suggest anything but this. Better yet, take the $100 you would have paid per ticket and give it to one of the homeless people you see on the bridges or place a healthy bet on one of the roulette tables. Either way you have a much better shot at feeling good about yourself then you would after leaving this show.

Excellent breakfast burritos and chorizo platter. Also try the tacos, rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole. I wish the carnitas was actual shredded pork but it is more of a cut up pork chop. No complaints overall although I have had a french fry end up in my burrito once. Would also be nice if they packaged the food separately. If you get a combo that includes enchiladas they put the other item (taco, burrito, etc.) on top of the enchilada. Makes it a bit messy and would prefer the other item be wrapped separately.   Staff is friendly and the food comes out pretty quick.

Good food at a great price. I usually get the gyro platter. The small Greek salad that it comes with is large enough for my wife to take to work for lunch. Much more than one person should eat for sure!
