middle of the road.  I'd give it 2.5 stars.  the shrimp fried rice was very good, the teriyaki chicken good, the orange chicken pretty blech.  Overall, I'd say it was decent.  Not great, not good, but not terrible.  Just average.

Outstanding quality body shop.  Trusted them with my BMW and they did an amazing job.

Love the pizza here!  This place would get 5 stars, except you have to beg for napkins at this place.  They give you 1 napkin (pizza is greasy), and if you go up to the counter, they have them behind the counter so you have to wait for someone at the other end of the counter to come down to get you more than 1 napkin.  Pretty lame.  I guess napkins are expensive now???

pretty terrible pizza joint.  I like TJ's much more.  I've tried this place twice, and both times, it was pretty bad.  The first time, I just ordered two slices.  They took two pretty old cheese pieces of pizza out of their warming rack, threw on pepperoni and mushroom on top if it, and just served it.  I think the pizza had been in the warming rack for several hours.  The second time I tried them, I just ordered a small pizza so I knew it would be fresh.  It was, very bleah, even for pizza.  Don't  waste your money.

If you want to get ripped off, call JR Perkins.  They charge a large service call fee, AND a high installation fee, and don't wrap it into one.  Most companies waive the service call fee if you get work done with them.  JR Perkins does not, and doesn't tell you that up front either.  Most companies perform the same work for about 1/2 as much and don't price gouge.  If I could give 1/2 a star, I would.

They sold me a discontinued toilet, installed in an hour, and charged me $380.00.  The toilet, which I looked up the brand and model number later that day, costs $89.00.  So, not only did they sell me a discontinued toilet and didn't tell me which is pretty lame, but they charged me almost $300.00 for one hour of labor as well. Pretty sketchy business practices.

I like Earl's, not fancy, but very good food most of the time.  I had their Cajun Blackened Chicken and 1/2 rib combo, and it was outstanding.  The environment is very nice, the bar area is cool with a large central bar on the left hand side of the building as you go in. Also, their artichoke dip is outstanding.  Fair prices as well across the board for their food.

* Pizza is outstanding. * Garlic Cheese Breadsticks are incredible. * Wings are above average. * Owner really takes care of his customers. * Fast delivery, and NO DELIVERY CHARGE like most places. * Only negative is they close very early some nights.  Overall, great place, excellent food, fair prices.  I'm hooked.

5-star pizza! Great if you love thin crust pizza. The seating isn't great in here, but the pizza is outstanding.

Outstanding taco's and tequila here!  They have over 100 brands of tequila and some of the best taco's I've had in a long long time.  I kind of expected it to be good, but not amazing, but I was wrong.  The food was way better than I expected.    I tried 3 different taco's from the 13 they offered, and all 3 were incredibly good.  The free chips and salsa were very good.  They had 2 different salsa's as well, the red was very good, but the green salsa was just incredible.  The bartender said the red just recently won a "Best Salsa in Phoenix" award from someone, but I was way more impressed with the green salsa (which I almost didnt try, as just by looking at it, you wouldnt think it would be good).  Pretty friendly environment inside and great staff.    I went for lunch, but it seems like it would get pretty busy for the bar crowd after dinner on the weekends, especially being right next to Patty's 1st Avenue Lounge.  Definitely a cool hangout, and a little nicer on the inside than I expected at least in terms of the tables, but then the booths and the bar seemed like more chill areas and more casual for sure.    I hope this place makes it and stays a long time.  They could use another TV or two in the bar area (at least downstairs), but thats hardly a complaint.  I was very impressed overall.  Definitely worth your time to go check out.

These things are outstanding.  Just went there yesterday for the first time, and these were amazing.  I bought the bundlets, which are 3.99 each.  I tried the Chocolate Chocolate Chip, Red Velvet, and White Chocolate Raspberry.  All them them were great, but I liked the Red Velvet the best.  The icing on them is very good too.  I highly recommend this place and will definitely go there again.

Checked out Red Mango for the first time, excellent frozen yogurt!  I really liked the pomegrante flavored one.  The rest were very good, but not amazing like the pomegrante.  Not really much seating in this place, so get your yogurt to go.

Ordered from them last night, the owner or manager was really cool.  His delivery driver took off early, but he zipped out himself for the last delivery.  Pizza was very good, cut into squares, lots of cheese, great ingredients.    The only thing knocking them down to 4 stars, is they are pricey.  Not even just pricey, but almost overpriced.  I'm sure if you're just buying a couple slices over lunch, its not bad, but as a whole pizza, its expensive.  A large cheese pizza was 16 bucks, another 2.25 for each topping (I had two), add on tax and delivery charge, and the total was 24.75, NOT INCLUDING TIP!  Ouch.  Good pizza?  Yes, its VERY good!  Good value?  mmmmmmmmmm, not so much.  Try to find a coupon just to make it normal priced.

Went there for the first time today.  Excellent burger, and all the extra's on the burger are free which is pretty nice.  It was just over 10 bucks for a cheeseburger, regular fries, and large drink. The food was excellent.  I ding it down to 4 stars though, just because anything this good has to be unhealthy, and its definitely greasy.   The grease from the fries saturated my brown paper take-out bag.  They also squished the top of my bun pretty bad when wrapping it up in tin foil.  I'm guessing if you eat there, you don't have this problem as much.  Still, 4 stars for an excellent burger and fries place.  Definitely a step up over In-N-Out.

I hired CertaPro to rip out the shelves and rods in my master closet, patch, texture, and paint the closet, as well as paint the ceiling in my living room.  They were extremely professional and took great care to make sure no paint dripped on my floor, couch, or TV.  They were great with the details and touched up requested spots as well.  I am very happy with the end result.

Outstanding pizza.  I wish you could buy it in a smaller size though than 18".

Tried it 3 times and was disappointed each time.  The pizza is very underwhelming.  I was really excited to have a new pizza place in the area, too.  It's too bad.

The wings, cheese bread, and calzones are all excellent.  The pizza is good, but not great.  The various flavored crusts though really help.  Definitely happy they made it up to N. Phoenix.
