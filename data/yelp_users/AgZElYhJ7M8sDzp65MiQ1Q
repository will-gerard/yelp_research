AMAZINGGGG!!!!! I discovered Oregano's while in college at ASU and I have since gotten every family member, boyfriend, friend, etc. addicted.  My favorites include: Vino Bambino, Cheesy Garlic Bread, Italian Gold wings (with a side of medium dipping sauce), Big Rig with meatballs, and a half chocolate chip half white chocolate Pizookie! It's safe to say you will be in a food coma after consuming all of this so beware. On top of delicious food and fun drinks (the sangria is a fave) the staff is always on top of it. Plus they have very clever sayings on their shirts! This is an absolute must for everyone!!

I will try to be as honest and fair as I possibly can in this review but it will NOT be pretty....  I was a very loyal customer of Discount Cab during my college years and never really had anything bad to say. Yes, there was the occasional late pick up or unpleasant driver but I used them over any other company (in fact they were the only one I had in my phone).  When I started traveling back and forth to California on a regular basis I used them to schedule my airport trips because I felt they were very reliable for a cab company... that was a HUGE MISTAKE!!!!   The first incident occurred when I made a reservation, received a confirmation email, and they never showed up. When they were about 5 minutes late I called just to check on the status and they informed me no one was on their way and something must have happened. She apologized and said the first person she could dispatch to me would be about 20-30 min. Since I was catching a flight that was not going to work so I refused the service and found a different way to get to the airport.   Fool me once, shame on you....Fool me twice, shame one me....  Based on my previous years of service I gave them a second chance. This time I was waiting outside with my suitcase and saw the cab drive by but they never slowed down and never called to say they were there. I proceeded to run after him waving my arms thinking he would see me and stop... nope. He made one loop then exited the apartment complex. I called the dispatch center and they said, "he made an attempt to pick up but you were not outside." If I wasn't outside then how did I see him and call?!?!?! At that point I was DONE and driving myself to the airport. I asked to speak to a manager and unfortunately my poor experience did not end there. When I spoke to the manager he apologized profusely and told me to save any receipts for my parking at the airport and they would pay them. Well, when I got back and called him with my receipts asking what email he would like me to send them to he denied every speaking to me and refused to pay any portion. After a long argument I vowed never to use them ever again!   I will warn all of you to NEVER use Discount Cab!!!!!!!

This place is Heaven!! Scottsdale has needed an ice cream place for a long time and this place is AMAZING!!! They make ice cream from scratch with liquid nitrogen and have unique flavor offerings as well as toppings. I don't think my taste buds even have a way to describe how perfect it was. Creamy, crunchy, sweet perfection. My boyfriend got an Oreo milkshake that was also delicious. Hands down best ice cream and it's fun to watch!!
