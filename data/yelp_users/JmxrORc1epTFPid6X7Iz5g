UNFRIENDLY TO TATTOOED PEOPLE. The other night a friend and I were out having a few drinks in Tempe market place for her co-workers birthday. We stay for one drink and decide to change venues. One of my friends co-workers suggested we go this place called Cadillac Ranch. On our way into Cadillac Ranch I was stopped at the door being informed that people like me were not allowed in this establishment. My first reaction was shock followed immediately with anger. I wondered what the exact problem was so I asked the door guy why People like me were not allowed in. He says "Well you have Tattoos on your neck" This immediately struck a nerve and I directed the bouncer to bring the manager to me. The manager was less than helpful, getting twenty feet away from me touching the sides of his neck and giving me a shoulder shrug. So I got no help from anyone and was ignored by management. I was shocked and appalled to find out That is how they treat people in this place. I have no gang affiliated tattoos of any sort and am a normal person with a normal life. I gave them NO reason to make them think I was going to start trouble. I think my tattoos are beautiful and in no way offensive. Long story short we leave along with around 10 - 12 people from our group that were inside already. I can personally say that I will direct anyone and everyone I know tattooed or not to stay far away from this establishment as they are not friendly to the tattoo / artistic community. And would not wish for any of my Family, friends, or aquatints to be belittled or have to put up with that type of ignorance they seem to be so adamant to show off to the public and potential future clientele.

So, I wrote a review on this place a while back about how this place was unfriendly to tattooed people and wouldn't even let me get close to the front door and was pleased to see that I got a little apology from the owner. But when I read the actual comment she left, it was this  "Thank you for taking the time to write this review. I apologize your level of service expectations were not met. It's our mission to please every customer with wonderful food, outstanding service, awesome entertainment and speedy service. Sincerely, Jessica (Marketing/ Event Coordinator) Cadillac Ranch Tempe"  First of all Jessica, I didn't actually experience any service at your establishment, or even had a chance to have my expectations met or not. My experience wasn't the kind that you can go, "Sorry for the service"  And Thank you so much for cutting and pasting this generic apology on every bad review Cadillac ranch gets. (Didn't think we would notice that?) By you doing that, It honestly just showed me that you truly didn't care about making it right at all by actually reading what happened in my experience there and apologizing for it. Instead you picked all the reviews with one star and stuck the same apology over and over hoping that would be enough to appease the public. I would say I have never been so insulted in my life but if you actually take the two minutes out of your busy day to actually read my review this time. you will obviously see otherwise. Thank you "Jessica" and Cadillac ranch staff for once again showing your true colors when it comes to customer service by doing the bare minimum.  Next time actually read the review.    -Thank you-
