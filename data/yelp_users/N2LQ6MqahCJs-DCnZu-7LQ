Love this place come here too much  If I go alone I sit at the bar. Wonderful service nice bartenders  If I go with my boyfriend we sit in the dining area servers are super nice too! Usually get snow or king crab and a shrimp basket with the amazing Cajun fries!!! Sangria is on point  only complaint is it's so popular sometimes the wait is long. But it's usually shorter than what they quote me

Great food and product! I just don't understand why it takes so long for everything! I go through the drive thru, expect to be there at least 10 minutes. I've ordered a sandwich, smoothies, and coffee  Always takes that long  Currently sitting in the drive thru waiting for JUST a coffee. It's been 12 minutes since I got my receipt. And prob a few more minutes since I actually ordered.  Not sure I'll come back unless I have a lot of time to kill. I've given it like 5 chances, with no change
