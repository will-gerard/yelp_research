Its unfortunate that even being a Diamond member, I couldn't enter the hotel to visit a friend who came from overseas.  The twitter/media folks have no understanding that they really shouldn't make their top tier customers upset over something like this (I guess they have some 4th of July event).  I'll give business to hotels that actually value me as a customer and not play stupid games.   In the end, I made a reservation, registered, saw my friend, then called American Express and charged them back.  Did it really take that?  That's the reason the hotel isn't on anyone's social radar anymore.  (I have to excuse my friend because she didn't know any better).

I really liked it!  We sat up at the bar, had some wine, a couple of the signature entrees.   Will definitely go back soon!

First time I had been there!   Ordered a few appetizers and both were great!  It has a great feel inside and I would definitely come back!

I just recently signed up for their service .  The owner of the local franchise came out to my home and explained their service model, products, schedule and the like.  I have to tell you, they are trustworthy, thorough and very customer dedicated.  I have a 3000sqft home and during the initial inspection they make a plan on how to clean your house in the most effective way.  I'm on a bi weekly rotation now and their folks do an excellent job.  If you have an area that may need closer attention, they are more than happy to take care of it (of if you happen not to be home) they will come back and take care of it with the manager on hand.  I also liked that they use "green" products (they bring everything with them, the only thing they use of mine is my own trash bags (at my request)).  Very great people and a pleasure to do business with.  Reasonable rates and I couldn't be more pleased.  PLUS my dog likes the team that comes to my house.  I invite you to come over if you don't believe the great work that they do.  Thanks!  JP

This is my new favorite Thursday night place!  Bar tenders are super nice, and the environment is friendly and inviting.    You can meet all sorts of different types of people!  Funny how trivia tends to bring people together!  Love the place!  Keep up the good work!

I've been coming to Christopher's (old location and now new) for about 10 years.....   I can't think of a better restaurant.   I can go on and on about how wonderful they are, but if you need a restaurant to go to with great atmosphere, friendly staff and awesome food, this is it.  - Don't go anywhere else!

It's unfortunate that a hotel brand isn't able to get their act together on the simple things.   From sending up (room service) the wrong wine, to being unable to correctly make a burger on their late nite menu (TWICE) , then have conversations with their mgt staff close to 1am.  I can spend my travel dollars anywhere I choose.  This Sheraton needs to realize that business travelers have that option and they need to be able totals care of customer simple requests.     I don't need to be explaining Starwood's service standards at 1am to their designated manager.  I rather be asleep and with my tummy full than frustrated that I gave my money to a hotel that doesn't have their stuff together.     Last time I stay here.   Save yourself money and stay at the Westin down the street.

Great place!!  I drove by it by accident, stopped in for a glass of wine and fell in love with it!!  Owner Mike is great and Mark the chef is a super guy as well.    Definitely check it out!

I am huge fan of Michael Mina restaurants!  From San Francisco to Scottsdale I will go out of my way to experience his different concepts.  Always a great experience..except AF.  The food - fantastic!  Great presentation..flavorful and unique in combination of ingredients.   Why a one star rating?  Service..  Service kills any positive thoughts I had about AF.  With so many choices we have as diners, restaurants should put their best foot forward when it comes to service.  I do not accept restaurants providing excellent food and mediocre service.  We must have had the new server that they just hired away from Applebees.. and let me tell you after spending $300 for two of us I expect better.  He would hardly talk, and when he did, it was mumbled.  Hardly came around to see if we needed anything, was laughing and joking with his other table and barely said two words to us.    Why the attitude I don't know.  It was that way from the start.  My recommendation is don't use your weakest talent to take care of your strongest customers.  Just doesn't work.     Even after sending a quick note about out disappointment to their people.. No one seemed to care.  And at this point neither do I - off to new and different restaurants.

I've used Sir Carpet 3 times in the last few months.  I have 2 dogs so they've had some accidents.  They are professional, on time and a great service provider.    They do a fantastic job every single time and I've also used them to clean my tile floors in my kitchen.     Can't say enough about them!  Keep it up!

Prime example of a restaurant/bar whose management doesn't understand its customers.  From slow service to overcharging, I've been there twice now and both times had what I consider ridiculously bad experiences.     The management's answer to everything is to cancel out the bill, but they wont fix any service problems.  When I ask to speak the the GM, I get handed a handwritten note with his email on it.    Providing good service isn't rocket science.  I'm dumbfounded that they still can't get it together.    Save your money..give it to another place that values you as a customer.
