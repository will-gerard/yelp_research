I have been coming to Bamboo house for at least 8 or 9 years now and have never been unsatisfied. The lunch specials are a perfect portion size, at amazing prices.  The orange chicken or orange beef are the best I've had anywhere.  I strongly suggest this place if you are looking for amazing Chinese at a great price!

Get here in the morning if you are interesting in lifting without waiting all the time... Doing cardio might be difficult in the morning. Staff seems friendly, equipment is clean, all in all a good place to workout.

Pegasus Cleaning is great!  I have a high standard when it comes to clean, and they more than exceeded it.   Prices are more than reasonable for what kind of work you get out of them, and they were right on time.  I would suggest anyone use Pegasus for cleaning needs! Only reason I am giving them a 4 not a 5 is due to a reschedule, they explained the situation and it ended up not being a problem.

I went into Delta Metals with some scrap metal I had left over from misc. household projects, and they were extremely friendly.  They explained to me their pricing and gave me a really good deal for stuff I thought was worthless.    I strongly suggest going to Delta Metals for your scrap or recycling needs, They are the best priced Recycling Center I could find!  Although it wasn't for me, due to my extremely small volume, they explained to me how setting up an account could benefit through fixed prices rather than daily market pricing (which can flux quite a bit).

This food truck has it going on.... I am a huge burger fan and these are top notch! I ordered the Black and Blue burger and it was amazing. The balance of flavors, the juicy patty, smoked bacon and fresh baked bun can't be beaten.   They also have fresh lemonade, I had the mango, and it was phenomenal!  If claim to be a burger fan, your list is not complete until you try these!

So, I had always been a white truffle swiss burger guy myself, but I asked the folks at Aioli Burger to surprise me with anything but the falafel Burger. They gave me the "Aioli Burger" and it was awesome, only problem is now I don't have a favorite burger I have two. These burgers are out of this world.

My office ordered catering for a lunch group of 30 - we selected the chicken and carne options for meat, a green salad, and Modern Tortilla provided all the toppings.  The delivery was on time, and the food was hot.  While setting up the food the employee asked me when the party planned on eating, and provided specific instruction on the tortillas as to ensure they did not get cold or soft.    The lunch was a hit and we would definitely use them again!
