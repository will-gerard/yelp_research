Super disappointed in the bar service by bar tender Andre. I thought he he waiting on me to order because I wasn't paying attention,  when I turned around I said "sorry" and started to say "Id like" and he cut me off saying "wait a minute! " no please or sorry I'm putting in another order...then he said "what do you want?" In a very unpleasant tone. I ordered and he gave me the beer with out even looking at me this entire order.  no thx or have a good night or anything.  I come here and often,  when I take a table the service is always wonderful and warm. They always remember me and treat me like a familiar  face they are happy to see. I'm much happier spending more of my $ when I'm treated this way. This guy made me feel awkward and was very unpleasant to deal with.

Decided to try something new (the lumberjack Burger) it was delicious!!  And to make up for my last experience the manager covered my meal and my sons meal! As, always my waitress was super sweet.
