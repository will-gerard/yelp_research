Not a fan.  Had the sesame chicken lunch combo and did not like it at all.  The soup if a veggie and if you want egg drop it's a $1.00 more, the fried rice has nothing fried it's just yellow rice.  The chicken was hard and the sauce wasn't good.  It was just not a good experience.

Went to Red Devil with a few friends to experience their wings and pizza.  I was not impress with the food at all.  My friends liked it but for me the Pizza had a cardboard taste to it.  I'm from Chicago where Pizza is Pizza and this place did not do it for me.  Sorry!

So after reading all these reviews I thought to take a chance so I went to explore.  I arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately.  The atmosphere was ok, and the bar looked a bit disorganized.  I ordered the the sesame chicken and egg drop soup.  I asked if I could pay extra for shrimp fried rice but was told no.  I chose the fried rice vs white or brown.  Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it.  On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked.  The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.  The fried rice looked like it was done in a hurry with many white spots in it and with little taste.  The egg role wasn't bad although they did not serve with hot mustard sauce.  I will not be returning to this place.

Go there for lunch about twice a week.  Portions are great and the service is very good too.  Their food is also very good and different in some cases where I've been pleasantly surprised.  Will continue going there and will recommend.

Been looking for a good Italian restaurant and finally found one.  My wife and I went here for dinner on Sunday night.  Everything we had was excellent.  I recommend you come by and try it out.  I will be back for more.  Best Italian in town. The owner has been there for 30 years and does all the cooking.

This place is great. I only experienced take out but the food was great. A bit pricey but well worth it. Will definitely return to dine inside. Would recommend the tamales and carne a safe tacos.

I've gone to this place several times for their 3 combination plate.  I always get the seseame chicken with the fried rice and add $2.00 worth of shrimp.  It's the best I've had since I've been here in Phoenix.  I've also order shrimp fried rice and love it.  Great place, decor not that great but very good food.  Will continue going there.

Went to this place for dinner after reading the reviews. Not what I am looking for as far as Chinese food is concerned for my taste.  Portions were decent but lacked taste.  Will not return as there are better places out there for me.

As I read reviews and see things like "it's unhealthy", and "tasteless food", I can only disagree.  I've been to this Outback Steakhouse several times a week and love it.  The seasoning is always on point and I never had a bad experience there.  Like someone said in their review " the average person is either too lazy or too ignorant to realize that a good NY Strip can be prepared for half the price and in half the time", so why are you dining at Outback then?    By the way the Caesar salad was awesome and the bread is fresh.  Sounds like you are an unhappy individual to begin with and probably tip under 15% or want management to review your post and offer something for free.

Weekend hours are incorrect. They open at at 11am.   They have new menu items that are awesome. The shrimp and scallop pasta and the shrimp risotto are my favorite. All their pastas are fresh. Great atmosphere.

I went to this place for dinner this past week with my family.  I ordered the sausage rigatoni and my wife ordered the seafood angel hair pasta.  We also had the mussels in rustic roma sauce which was amazing!  The experience was great and the service was also very good.  I would be returning as I actually enjoyed this place vs. other Italian places I've been to.  I would recommend it to others.

I ordered from this place twice.  The first time was ok and the 2nd was horrible and they got my sweet and sour pork order wrong.  I tried to call in another order and the guy on the phone didn't let me explain what I wanted and told me to not order from there again if I wasn't happy.  I never went back, I think there are many other places where the food is way better than this place as well as the service.  I don't need to spend my money at a place that does not value it's customers.  Also, the place is a filthy dive.

Went to this place over the weekend and ordered 12 wings for pickup.  I only had the wings this time around and they were very good.  You can usually pull around the drive through but there was a car in front of me so I opted to enter the restaurant instead.  The owner was at the cash registered and from placing my order over the phone with a female employee to my encounter with the staff when I arrived and despite them being busy was great.  The customer service experienced this time around was way better than a previous experience I had in the begging of the year.  I will be returning for the wings which I enjoyed very much!

This place is decent however lacks cleanliness which is concern for me when I want to dine in. Food is good I had their teriyaki rice bowl and their ultimate meat bowl which was also pretty good.  I think Yogis on Camelback j's the best rice bowl place in the valley though.

Dear Yelp, There has to be a better way to write a review of a closed business so others know that it's closed without having to continuously get messages that j can't post that because my review is short. Maybe a business j's. Loses button or something????    Pink Lotus is closed for business. The owner retired. That's all folksssssssss.

Lenny's burgers are fantastic.  One of the best burgers out here.  They are a bit pricey especially charging extra for the cheese and fries can add up to $10+.  Overall good place to get an occasional burger from time to time.

Went to Texas Roadhouse a few times and I am a big fan. I order to eat and yes I ordered the NY Steak (18 or 20 oz), it was delicious! I also ordered the onion appetizer dish which was out of this world.  Highly recommended.  Service is always spot on too.

This store's customer service is awesome. I upgraded my wife's phone from a 4s to a 6s plus and Nathan took care of us. He gave us great service a store credit for my wife's old phone. I got 2 great speaker, a screen protector and a case for my wife's new phone for free due to the 240 store credit.  Nathan also applied the screen protector and ported all the photos and info from the old phone. He also went over every detail of the upgrade.  I haven't experienced customer service like that in a longtime.  This will be my store for all my sprint needs.   Thanks

Gave this place a try despite customer service challenges in a few reviews. Place looks nice and family owned. Although I wasn't greeted immediately the person at the counter did take order quickly and I was thanked as I got my order. The sandwiches was awesome served on fresh made bread. I didn't see an issue with this place. I will return.

WARNING!!!! DO NOT GO THROUGH THE DRIVE THROUGH.  Went there last Saturday and waited 20 minutes in line at the drive through.  Thought it was an isolated incident so went back Sunday afternoon, waited 15 minutes.  When I finally got to the window I saw a manager wearing a white button down shirt and black jeans wearing glasses, I told him my complaint and he mumbled something and turned away.  Never any apologies and what's worst no one seemed to care.  I will never go there!

Went to this place with family for a birthday party and tried various items from the menu.  Wasn't impressed with the food and the quality of the items.  I've had better and will not be back since there are better places to dine at in the valley.  Sorry for being kind of harsh but I am only being real.

After reading all the hype I decided to check this place out.  I checked out their online menu and the lobster in black bean garlic sauce caught my eye so I headed out the door with my wife and son and went for dinner.  I did not order the stir fry.  I arrived at the location and was greeted by an older asian woman who sat us and got our beverages.  I ordered shrimp fried rice, lobster in black bean garlic sauce, pot stickers and my wife ordered the peking beef.  The food arrived and as soon as I saw the lobster I knew we had a problem.  The plate itself looked messy and unappealing.  The lobster was way overcooked and hard, I did not consume half of the dish.  The taste was very lacking and the sauce was very bland.  The shrimp fry rice was basic with peas and carrots in the dish.  The pot stickers were delicious.  The peking beef was okay.  Needless to say I will not be returning to this place and would not recommend it to anyone else. I did communicate my dislike to someone who looked like the owner or manager.

While in Tempe decided to get some Chinese food.  After searching Yelp we decided to go to China King.  The restaurant has a wedding reception feel to it.  We ordered shrimp fried rice, the beef in french sauce, scallops in XO sauce and my wide ordered the spare ribs in black bean garlic sauce which they made special for her since they are not on the menu.  We enjoyed our meals and they were very tasty.  I would go back and recommend to others.

Went to this place for lunch with family today.  Wasn't impressed and after going to the one on 83rd and Bell which was a much better experience.  Arrived and was seated by host.  Drinks brought out quickly, ordered the mussels in rusted garlic sauce, Cesar salad, rigatoni alla diavolo, my wife ordered the mussels in alfredo sauce.  I ordered a childs pizza for my son.  Had to ask for bread which is usually not requested in Italian restaurants.  Server Mary brought bread when requested but with no butter, brought salad and never offered Parmesan cheese.  Food came out and compared to the 83rd Ave location it was bland and my son's pizza looked like they had someone training for the first day.  The thing wasn't even round.  Nonetheless I will be returning to that location.  The place was stuffy too.

This used to be one of favorite places so after a while of not having lunch there I decided to go for my birthday. I was more than disappointed. The concept that u so much loved had changed completely. They no longer brought out and made the sauce at your table. When I asked I was told that corporate changed it to by request only. Despite requesting it I never got it. No sugar for my ice t and the food was not the same. Needless to say I will not be returning to this chain anymore. Corporate strikes again. So long PF Changs.  It was a good run while it lasted.

Went here for the first time. Was expecting more but was disappointed and will not be back. I felt as they nuclear and dime you. I ordered the shrimp poor boy for 11 bucks, j asked the girl at the counter if it came with anything and she said no. I asked so it's a la cart? And she said yes. So I decided to order a side of coleslaw and 4 shrimps. I also ordered two cocktail Sauces for the shrimp. When my good arrived I was surprised that the poor boy came with only lettuce and tomato and the fried shrimp no sauces whatsoever. It was the driest sandwich I've ever earned. I had to grab some mayo for it. The shrimp was as expected but what posted me off the most was that the sandwich h did come with fries but the girl at the counter reflected to  tell me that. I also noticed complementary cocktail sauce by the soda machine which would've been free. Unfortunately I saw that after I had paid. In addition the food came without my coleslaw so I had to ask for it despite already paying for it. Will not recommend it be returning.

Drove by this place many times but never really stopped in until today. I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which is on sour dough bread and it was very good. It came with hash browns which were excellent. It's a down to earth style diner and the atmosphere reminded me on Chicago. Great place I will definitely return.

Great little place located off of Bethany just west of I 17.  It's on the south side of the street and if you don't look for it you will miss it.  Little family type place where they have a good Chef that is popular with the Spanish TV channel.  Great food, they open at 6am and you can order anything from breakfast to Pizza and Burritos (yes even that early).  The place is small and is usually packed on the weekends.  They only accept cash so don't bring plastic.  Their Burritos are only $2.50 and are fresh.

I've been here several times since I think this is one of the better Chinese restaurants in the valley.  From their egg rolls to their main courses the food is always very tasty and service is always pretty good.  I always order the shrimp fried rice, egg role and the mangolian beef.  The restaurant is very nice and the decor is friendly, inviting and can be a great intimate setting.

Well being a loyal customer sometimes has its disappointments. Today I went to Dutch Bros on Camelback and Central as this is one of my favorite places to get my usually iced beverage but I've noticed that lately they have been filling the cup all the way with ice. Last time I was there I asked for light ice and they still filled it past the half way mark. Today I requested less than half ice in my beverage because I was tired of getting half the product and paying close to five dollars for it They tried to hit me with a speech about charging me an additional fifty cents to top it off. What happened to these guys?  They use to be so good to their customers. Now it seems it's all about the profits. I remember when they first opened and I still gm there. I have spent hundreds of dollars at this establishment. Hope they make a change or I'm gonna Starbuck it again!

This place is pretty good.  The food is excellent and the service varies from slow to fast depending on the day of the week.  It's packed on Saturdays.  They just expanded and the place is bigger now.  This is the 2nd time I've been there and the experience this time was a lot better.  The food is fresh and the flavors are great.  The menu is 3 pages and has lots of choices.  Would recommend.

Felt like some Chinese food so I yelped Chinese food and this place popped up. I decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. This place is very good and different from any other Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. They offer you a selection of protein and a selection of sauces so I decided to have shrimp and pepper and tomatoes in dark sauce. It was excellent. It came with fried rice and I ordered a beverage and an egg roll all for under $13.00.   Service was great too. I definitely will be returning to this place and recommend it too.

I had a crack on my BMW 545I windshield and didn't understand the process on the whole insurance coverage. I was worried that my premiums would go up and that I would have to pay a deductible. I called my insurance company and they said I could replace it with no charge or issues. They recommended a few business they use. I decided to look on yelp as I usually do before making final decisions and found Blue Chip Auto Glass. I called them and immediately noticed how professional and knowledgable they are. They handled everything for me and came to my home and installed my new windshield. I highly recommend this company. I am so happy with the service, quality and professionalism. A+. It didn't cost me a dime.

Just had some work done for my transmission which went defective after so many complaints to the dealer about it. The car was slamming a lot and turned out the transmission was bad. Worked with Brian and Trinity from Phoenix Bimmer and was able to get a new one on my extended warranty. I gotta say I love these ppl they are very professional and communicated with me every step of the way. Brian did a great job and my car feels like new again. No more slamming. Forget the dealership I'm glad I found these guys.

As I scroll down and read some of these reviews I laugh because those of you that have experienced a real "Chicago" hotdog or italian beef would know that we are the best at it. First if you're looking for just a "regular" hotdog go to Teddy's or some place that broils them. I go to Joey's frequently and they are the best hotdog place out here. Living in Chicago all my life then moving out here I have to say it was a hard 3 years trying to find a real chicago dog. I went there yesterday and had an italian beef dipped with hot peppers. Awesome!!

Went to Woody's BBQ with my family on a busy Friday night.  The service was very slow and we waited almost an hour before the food came out.  The place was crowded.  We ordered a slab of ribs, onion rings and a combination plate with all the meats.  My wife enjoyed her dish and the slab of ribs were just OK for me.  The onion rings weren't that great.  I saw a manager yelling at a service from our table.  Don't know what the issue was but it was unprofessional.  He was really on her.  Don't think I will be back, I have a better experience at Famous Dave's.

I go here at least twice a month.  It's an awesome experience and the staff is friendly and on the ball.  I always stack up on the seafood items, add some mushrooms and spinach and choose my sauce.  I also get double rice noodle.  You can also get free white or brown rice when your server brings you your bowl.  I will continue going there.

Although Yogis are found around the valley the first one I went to was the one in Phone on Camelback road and 16th street.  The one on Happy Valley is ok but I wasn't impressed. As a comparison to the one in Phoenix on Camelback I have to say that this one is not as generous with their portions. I think they should be equally as good but did not feel that way. I though this may have been a one off but I returned a second time and they were consistent with their same portions which did not compare to the one on Camelback. I was disappointed with the portion size and the quality of the chicken which I found to be cold and a not dry. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl and ordered the large one at that.  I will keep going to the one on Camelback.

This place is clean and very friendly. The food is very good and fresh too. I am writing this review because you can tell this restaurant is operated by a family and I really wish the owner reads this review. I want to give the owner kudos for being real. I love this place because they play Christian music on the radio and are not afraid as they shouldn't be to be proud of this. Don't get me wrong I'm not a church going person but do believe in God and in this day and age where prayer is banned in our schools and other places I am relieved that there are still people out there that keep it real. Good job!  God bless and keep it up. Love your concept.   Thanks!

Go to Burger King it's better than this store. Don't get me wrong I usually love 5 Guys Burgers but I've been to this specific restaurant twice and both times I've had bad experiences.   First time they put one piece of lettuce on my burger. I was so pissed and felt that they were probably short on it so I didn't say anything. Really 1 small piece? Fries were also undercooked and soggy.    Today as I was driving around I decided to try it again just in case they had a bad day on my first visit. I ordered the same as I have before when my order was ready I noticed my burger meat patty was so flat I didn't know if it was because they were messing with me or a training issue.  The bun was stale and the fries (you guessed it undercooked and soggy).  I am done and decided to just go elsewhere.   Needless to say I will NEVER go to this store again.   Management should focus on training staff on freshness and not pushing stale buns. Also don't flatted the patty to the point that you don't taste it.

I am giving this place 1 star due to the fact that not only is it small but I went in today to eat and it was so hot that I decided not to eat here. Management should really consider improving air flow. I will not even give them the opportunity as I am a beer drinker and I dread drinking beer that is cool Vs cold.  I won't be returning. I even told the server that it was really hot inside. She agreed with me but that was it. My wife did eat and she does like it. Not me.

Ok after seeing some mixed review I decided to give it a try and report my experience at this place. I am here as j write this review.   First I cannot comment on what this place was 6 to 8 months ago I can only report my experience as of today.   This is is better than other buffet places out there. The food is pretty good and well with the money. I tried a variety of things and they were all good to me. The service was good the server refreshed my drink immediately and the place was clear and the decor was new and warm. For a meal under 13 bucks I will definitely repeat. To sum it up this place is good Buffett food for a low price.   That's my review. Enjoy!

I own a business walking distance from this place and decided to take several employees there for breakfast this week.  Food was as expected okay.  The real disappointment was someone from my party asked if they can switch the English Muffin for a waffle and charge us for the difference.  The server said no.  Not good as other places would've jumped to creating a great experience.  As we all know business survive on repeat local business.  We won't be back there as the customer service just wasn't there.  I can't understand why they have 2-3 employees outside on the streets with signs to get business but once you're there they can't meet your your simple expectations.  I mean, really?  Charge us for the freakin waffle and serve it, don't just tell us no.

I went to this place after reviewing some of the posted reviews.  I love chinese food and have tried many places.  This place was OK, nothing great or better than some of the places I've been too.  The decor and atmosphere were nice but the food was bland for my taste.  I will stay with my other chinese places.  Thanks

Great wings and atmosphere.  The place is new so it looks good and feels good.  Service is a bit slow and food can take a while to get to you when they are busy.  This is something they need to work on but that won;t stop me from returning to this particular one.  (Go Bears)!

Great food. Not a restaurant but there is an outdoor area where you can eat. This place is more take out/ catering.
