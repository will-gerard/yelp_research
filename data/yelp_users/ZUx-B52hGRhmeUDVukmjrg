This is a delicious neighborhood restaurant!  I can't speak to their sushi much because I have become such a fan of other items on the menu. The handful plus times I have had sashimi here it has always been good.  Now on to my favorites! The Asian nachos are a must get. Instead of tortilla chips they use wonton chips. Topped with a yummy cheese sauce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. Their guacamole is a mix of avocado and edamame. Yum! Add some chicken and these are super yummy and great for sharing.  During my most recent visit here I discovered they have a new edamame. Bun Bo Edamame. It's very spicy. Too spicy for my tongue but the friend I was with loved it.  Saved the best for last - the Mojo dessert. I am not a big dessert person, but I almost always order dessert here. It looks like a sushi roll. You get rice krispy treats, rolled up with Nutella, ice cream and a brownie in the middle. Delicious!!!

This is a nice treat I allow myself once in a while. I love the garlic bagel. (Truth...I wish Einstein's did not put sesame seeds on their garlic bagel but they added that years ago and I don't think they will ever switch back.)  The service here has always been quick and they almost always give just the right amout of cream cheese.

I love this store. It's always a fun treat when I find myself with the time to stop in. The sales staff are super friendly and not at all pushy. They have a wide selection of quality, modern decor. I would love to decorate my whole home with Copenhagen pieces...if only I could afford to. Maybe someday!

Such a great dive bar! Nice bartenders. Drink specials daily. Pool table. Darts.  Oh yeah...and best ladies restroom in a dive bar ever! This is how I always sold this place to friends when suggesting we go here. Then I realized one day that they actually received a Phoenix New Times award for that exact thing. And it's true. You know how it is ladies...typically at a dive bar you don't want to have to go to the bathroom unless you absolutely have to. Here it is a pleasure. Clean, scented lotion, other important lady products if needed. It's not at all what you would expect.  Also, if you get a chance come here around Christmas time. It's like a mini version of Coach House with lights and decorations everywhere.

So the birthday boy and I went here the other night because he wanted to get his treat of a free scoop. Unfortunately, we learned after driving out of our way to get here that they no longer honor birthday coupons. I understand there is a cost associated with accepting the coupon, but it seems as though it would be a small one for loyal customers. I think the company as a whole should accept a coupon or have a way of notifying people when they search for locations near them.

My mom was going to be coming back from the airport at a time I was unavailable to pick her up. We decided what made the most economical sense was to drop her car off at an airport parking lot for her to pick up the next day instead of spending a lot of money for a week of parking or a super shuttle to her house. So I found a coupon for this parking lot where we have parked many times in the past for $6.50/day with a free shuttle from the airport.   When she picked up the car the next day she gave the ticket to the attendant which is supposed to tell them what to charge based on how long you have been there. The car was there for less than 24 hours. When the attendant first rang up the ticket there must have been a prior ticket still in the system because she told my mom her total was $23.50. What?!? My mom told her it had been there less than 24 hours and that she gave her a coupon for $6.50. So the attendant corrected it and told my mom that her total is $9.50. When my mom asked about the difference between $6.50 and her total she was told that it was a $3.00 fuel and service charge.   This "fuel and service charge" is ridiculous. The coupon says $6.50 per day. Said nothing about additional fees may apply. Also advertised "free shuttle". So clearly the shuttle is not "free" if this fuel and service charge applies. When I dropped the car off I was not told about any additional fees either.   $3.00 is not a huge amount but I went here specifically because of the coupon. If I had known other fees would be added on top of the price I would have found her cheaper pricing elsewhere. I will not be returning here for my airport parking needs in the future if they tack on unannounced "fees" at the end. The attendant was very rude to my mom when she questioned the fee and the attitude was pretty much...if you want your car back pay it...

This is the first Einstein's I have been in that just has garlic on their garlic bagel! Love it!!! Every other Einstein's years back started putting sesame seeds on the garlic bagels. That was a frustrating change since I love garlic and strongly dislike sesame. But they are still good enough that I manage to overlook that. Imagine my delight today when I ordered a garlic bagel and it was just that, no sesame seeds. I hope they will all adopt this at all locations in the near future. It makes me a happy girl! =)

My mom and I went back recently and I have to give them kudos for turning up the steam room. It was great this time. Just the right amout of steam!  And the staff is so very friendly.   It is still not the same as a resort spa, but that is ok so long as that is not what you are expecting.

I highly recommend Dr. Bruce Schwartz and Pima Dental! They have a beautiful and inviting new office, with state of the art technology. The entire staff is so friendly and professional. Dr. Schwartz is genuine, intelligent and really cares about what is right for the patient. If you are looking for a great dentist, Pima Dental is the one.

The original fish taco's...yum, my favorite! I have also tried other things here and enjoyed them all. But my go to is their original taco, hold the cabbage.   The only non positive thing I have to say is that I am not a fan of any of their salsas. But that ok because everything I have had doesn't need them.  If you are looking for something affordable and tasty this is a good pick!

This is a great spot for brunch! I definitely recommend sitting on the patio, as it can be quite loud inside. The food is delicious. I love the french toast. They make great coffee and a strong cocktail. Service can be hit or miss.

I love Godiva! Yummy chocolate whenever you feel the need to treat yourself. Stopped in the other day and Vicki was so helpful and friendly. She gave me a couple of samles of different things which helped me settle on getting their milk chocolate caramels. Yum!

3 words...Twice Baked Potato! Oh my, these are so good!!! I love these so much I have even ordered them to go when we are grilling steaks at home. But it is always nice we we go there for dinner too.   The rest is good as well. I've had the filet, prime rib, various appetizers, a delicious orange martini.   Only once did I not enjoy my food. The one time I decided to order the peppercorn steak. Way too peppercorny. (is that a word? ;-)) It did live true to it's name but way too much. Couldn't taste anything else.  So stick with the basics and definitely get the twice baked potato.

I really, really wanted to give this spa 5 stars. It is truly beautiful but there were a couple of small things that made it not quite 5 stars for me. I would have given it a 4 and a half if I could have.   I'll start with the good stuff!  -Most gorgeous spa I have ever been to.  -Best "resort" massage I have ever received.  -Love the waterfall pool...it's like an extra massage!   Could be improved...  -Swiss shower felt amazing but I was a little short for it. And my friend who is even shorter couldn't enjoy it. Maybe a small step stool would be a nice addition for the vertically challenged. =)  -I was not a fan of the scented shower products. Just a personal preference but my friend and I were not a fan.  -It is GREAT that they finally serve alcohol at the spa pool. However, I was surprised that it is only served on weekends and last call is really early. (Last call was either 2:30 or 3:30pm on a Sunday. Early considering the spa is open till 10pm.   The two biggest reasons I was not able to give this place the 5 stars I wanted to...  -I thought the spa food was terrible. =( Not a very wide selection. The item I ended up choosing was not very tasty.  -When I entered the hot tub in the women's locker room I hurt my foot. Turns out that there is a vent cover to a drain or something at the base of the stairs that was missing. After being in the hot tub for a few minutes another spa goer found the cover floating next to them. She set it next to the spa. I was concerned that someone else might hurt their foot so I told the staff about the issue and that the cover was next to the hot tub. I was told they would fix it immediately. However, when I went to use the hot tub later that day...the drain was still uncovered and the cover that had been sitting next to the hot tub was removed. I am quite concerned that a safety issue such as this was not fixed and there was no warning to other guests. I hope no one else hurt their foot that day.   All that being said, we did have a fabulous day at the spa and I will certainly come back in the future. I'll just make sure to eat a big meal before I go and watch my step! =)

This is one of my favorite happy hour spots on Mill. They have the best Chambord margarita's! Be careful though...they are strong. Another must order item on the menu is the Tejas Trio.

I will start off by saying I know nothing about cigars... But I was out with a friend that wanted to buy a cigar for her friend. (She knows nothing about cigars either...) The young guy working that night seemed very knowledgeable about cigars and was incredibly helpful. If you want a cigar and some guidance this is the perfect place to find what you are looking for.

This store always makes me smile. It is a great place for a unique gift or something fun to treat yourself. They have everything from quirky books, drinking tools, fun nail polish, and on and on. If you get the chance definitely stop in and explore. You won't be disappointed!   They also have great bags they put your purchase in that you can use again and again for other things. And the staff is always super friendly.

This review is based only on visiting the hotel for attractions, restaurants, etc. You can see my reviews for House of Blues and Shark Reef Aquarium. My biggest frustration with the hotel is the horrible signage for visitor parking. I have been to many places on the strip and this one was by far the hardest to figure out where to park at. I would think you would want to make it easy for people to visit your establishment.

As I have mentioned in a couple of my other reviews, I am not a big fan of burgers. However, after a good experience at Smashburger I figured maybe I could enjoy if they are done right. A friend had kept wanting to try this place so I finally gave in.  My thoughts? Meh. I was completely underwhelmed by this place. I love their fries. It's the only thing I have had there before and those are still good. The burger though? No flavor... I asked for it minus the arugula (not a fan of the stuff) and I realized after I had left disappointed that they also managed to leave the bacon off. I certainly didn't ask for that. If that had been on there it might have been a little better. But even then I don't think it would have been a good burger.   If someone talks me in to going here again I will likely just stick with the fries. Get the combination basket, half sweet potato and half regular.

I love, love, love Cibo! I know it has tons of great reviews but I feel it is time to add my own. In my opinion Cibo is better than Pizzeria Bianco and way less wait.   This is a great place for sharing. My favorite night at Cibo goes like this... The delicious pesto salad. ( I am not usually a big salad person but this one is quite interesting.) Then on to the pizza. I generally get the margherita pizza but had the diavola the other day and now I am hooked. For desert all of the crepes are amazing. And if you've never had limoncello I highly recommend you try it! And of course you can always share a bottle of wine for dinner.   Great food, reasonable prices and beautiful patio!

Oddly enough I had never been to a Bison Witches location before last week and then I ended up visiting the Tempe and Tucson locations within a couple days of each other.   My impression at both...fussy wait staff and not particularly attentive. I already reviewed Tucson, so this review will just be about Tempe.   A group of friends went there for happy hour. It took me a while to get our servers attention to order a drink. When I did get to place my order she wasn't familiar with the specials. I was told something was on happy hour but turned out it wasn't. So when she came back to tell me I picked another choice.  My boyfriend was stuck working late so I asked if I could order a happy hour beer for him. The waitress said no because she would need to see his ID. I understand it is Tempe but come on, really? I didn't have to tell the truth...I guess I should have just ordered it instead of asking. We were not a table of college kids, it was a table full of adults. I told her his age and said she is more than welcome to check his ID when he gets there. She seemed annoyed but finally agreed. She wouldn't bring it out till he got there. That was fine by me since that means he would get a cold beer instead of a warm one. Then when he did get there it took a while to get her back to the table to let her know he was there.  A friend did order the broccoli soup in the bread bowl. I got to have a taste and it was pretty good.  I just wasn't particularly impressed with this place. And with so many great options on Mill for happy hour, I am not sure I will return.

I have been eager to try this place for a while and we finally went here for dinner the other night. It is a small restaurant with a nice charm. Although, for the prices I would expect a little fancier atmosphere.  For dinner we ordered the Fuego Seafood Chile Relleno. The dish was tasty with a bit a kick. Since most of the dish was spicy it was served with a side of candied cabbage. I've never had that before... It was quite interesting and a fun contrast to the spiciness of everything else.   I ordered the dragonberry mojito. They have awards for their mojito's so I was expecting a lot. It was good but I would have preferred a little less mint and a little more dragonberry. But it was still good.  Overall I enjoyed the experience and am glad I finally got to try it.

Personally, I love their $5, one topping, large pizza with free flavored crust.   They have many crust flavors to choose from.But my favorite, hand's down, is the garlic and herb. YUM!!!   The pizza itself is fairly standard and tasty for a takeout pizza.  I will mention though that while this pizza tastes great fresh, it is not particularly great when reheated. Some pizzas taste better the next day...this is not one of them. It is ok reheated or cold but no where near as good as other pizza chains for leftovers.  (Please note, the $5 price is only valid at a handful of locations.)

We recently went to Yelp's Ultimate pleY Date! and received a couple coupons to Zoe's. I'm really glad we did! I tried this place when it first opened but haven't returned because I am not particularly a fan of Greek food. So I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. =)  Perry was behind the counter when we went in and she was so friendly and helpful! She helped with some recommendations. I ended up getting a grilled chicken pasta and my boyfriend got the chicken kabobs. Both were very tasty.

My mom wanted taco bell the other night, so we stopped in for a quick bite and I don't think I will be back. The location seemed dirty. I ordered the cheese nachos and was very disgusted when the order came out. They were on the typical fast food tray, but unfortunately there was no tray liner. I have seen how "clean" those trays are so needless to say I didn't eat the chips that rolled out on the tray. Lucky for me...when you order the nachos you don't get enough cheese for all the chips anyways, so I was still able to finish the cheese.

This is not my typical Fry's, however I was nearby running errands and figured it would be convienent to stop here instead of going to my regular Fry's.   The layout seemed odd and not logical. The shelf for the sale item my mom was looking for was empty. So we asked an employee if they could check to see if there was any in the back. It looked like they were restocking at the time so the chances seemed good that there might be. We asked the first employee we saw and he pushed us off to another employee. She seemed annoyed by our presense but asked what we were looking for and said she would go look. She must have then pushed us off to someone else because about 5 minutes later some guy we hadn't seen before walked up and asked if we were looking for something as the girl we had previously talked to walked by. So we told him what we were looking for. He disappeared for quite a while. When we finally did see him again he seemed to be chatting and socializing with another worker. After watching that for a few minutes it was clear he was just hanging out and not looking for our item so we decided to buy the couple things we had and leave. Mom decided she would stop at another Fry's since getting help at this one was going nowhere. On our way out the last guy that helped us (I use that term very loosely) saw us and said they didn't have what we were looking for and that he tried to find us. Well we didn't feel like waiting unitl he was done with his social conversation. It's hard to believe they had so many employees working but we couldn't get a simple answer if they had one product in stock after waiiting about 15 minutes.   Next time I will make sure I just go to my regular Fry's, even if it is slightly out of the way.

This is a grocery store like I have never seen before! Valet parking or covered spaces for those that park themselves. Once your inside you almost forget you are in a Fry's. Feels more like a high end whole foods or AJ's, but still with Fry's prices. Too bad it wasn't closer to home. I wouldn't mind filling up my cart here more often.

Largest grocery store ever! And in a good way.   This store has -A huge produce department -A huge fresh meat department -An infinite selection of tortillas -A full bakery -A jewelry store (you can get a piece of jewelry fixed while you shop) -Fresh cotton candy -A beverage bar with smoothies and lots of other things -And so much more  Definitely give your self a little time to explore. They have the regular items you will find at any other grocery store but also a lot of other obscure things you may have never tried before.   They are also typically the best deal for avocados in town. So if you are having a fiesta or just want an interesting grocery store experience then head over to your nearby Ranch Market.

I love the Orbit!!! It is a great free service for Tempe residents. As a full time ASU student, this service saves me so much money in parking or transit fees.   It definitely has its pros and cons...but can you really complain when it is free and useful?   In addition to using it to get to and from ASU, we have also used it for Mill Avenue and Tempe Marketplace.   The schedule is frequent but not necessarily consistent. It would be nice if it would run later it the day.  It is a bouncy ride, so hang on.  It is quite the diverse group of riders. People watching is never short of interesting.  The drivers, for the most part, are friendly and helpful.  Overall, I love this free service and am very thankful it exists!

I went here for lunch the other day and really enjoyed my meal.   I ordered the elephant garlic lunch plate. It was definitely very garlicky, which I loved! Many times when I order something with garlic in the name, I am disappointed to find it not true to the name. This place lived up to it's name and that makes this garlic girl happy!   They ask you how spicy you want your meal. I went with medium. That was perfect for eating it there (with the exception of one really hot bite, yikes!). But I did have leftovers, thanks to the good size portion. The heat definitely intensifies in the leftovers!!! So unless you plan on finishing or sharing your meal, you may want to opt for slightly lower heat setting so that your leftovers don't knock your socks off.  I was not a fan of the soup they give you at the beginning. The service was just ok.

I had to stop in here the other day to check on a book and I enjoyed checking out all the ASU gear they have. They have a large selection and very reasonably priced. I may need to buy a few items since I am now an ASU coed.  I highly recommend picking up the various student coupon books on campus. I don't recall which book this store has a few coupon in but it is in one of them.  I still think it is cheaper to get books online but for all your other ASU needs, I highly recommend. The staff is super nice and helpful!  Oh, and as a nice bonus...when I checked out they gave me a free daily planner. Not that I actually use a paper calendar anymore but it was nice anyhow. I will give it to my mom! =)

This Costco is huge! Almost twice as big as your average Costco...so make sure to wear comfortable shoes.   The selection here is also very different than other locations. It caters mostly to small businesses, but is open to all Costco members. If you need something in bulk but the regular Costco is not big enough (I know this sounds crazy right) then you have found the right place. For example, do you need 25 pounds of pepperoni or half of a lamb? But it is also great if you want to get meat or fruit for a party. The prices seem about the same or slightly lower per ounce/unit than the typical Costco.   Also, the staff was very friendly and helpful. They are happy to answer any questions you might have and if you need help finding something they will personally walk you over to it, rather than point and leave you to find it yourself.   This location is worth a stop if you are in the area or if you are hosting a large gathering.

Best martini I have ever had! I have tried a few different ones on the super long list to choose from but Triple Chocolate is my favorite!   They give you the martini glass and the shaker. This is great for two reasons. One - you get more martini than can possibly fit in one glass. Two - they don't fill it to the brim so you can actually walk around with your martini glass without spilling and wasting the delicious beverage.  Make sure when you are leaving you ask for a True Blue Lady VIP Card. (If you are a lady that is...) Next time you go, just show your card at the door and you get a ticket which is good for your first martini on the house. A free $12 delicious martini? Yes, please!!!  The food here is tasty. The flatbreads are good. So is the spinach dip.  They do play the music a bit too loud in the bar for happy hour. It makes it hard to hear the person right next to you. So just sip your martini and people watch.

I really like this place. The black bean burrito is great! Good portions. If you order in you get complimentary chips and salsa. Quick service. Fun decor.  The reason for the deduction of one star is because the place often seems like cleaning supplies. I appreciate that they try to keep the place clean but please try to do it at the end of the day or get less strong smelling products. It's not the most appetizing smell. I don't want to feel like I am eating my burrito with a side of Windex, I would rather smell my food.

Meh...that about sums up my thoughts on The Grind. Not great, not terrible.  I enjoyed the decor. The burgers are huge. A group of 4 of us went in for a special they were having so we all had to have the BLT Burger. Maybe if I had been able to pick a different burger this review might be different, but the BLT burger just didn't have much flavor. The fries were tasty. Asked for some orange slices to come with my beer to sweeten it up but they never came. My boyfriend had to go up to the bar to ask for them. When the bill came it was originally incorrect but they eventually fixed it to slightly better than the original special. I say eventually because once the waitress dropped off the bill it took her forever to come back. And it was a slow night so it was not due to other tables,  So like I said...some good, some bad. Overall just meh...  (Full disclosure - I am not a big fan of burgers in general. My boyfriend is though and he felt the same about the burger.)

I was really on the fence if I should give this review 3 or 4 stars.  Stopped in yesterday for the s'mores milkshake. This was my first visit to Beckett's Table and I've been wanting to try it ever since I heard a review about their chocolate covered bacon! The chocolate covered bacon is served as part of their s'mores dessert. For Arizona Dairy month they have made this dessert into a milkshake.  The milkshake was tasty but just ok in my opinion. I think it had one or two too many flavors going on for my preference. It had the standard s'mores ingredients of marshmallow, chocolate, graham crackers and also had an addition of bacon, caramel and peanut butter. I think if the peanut butter had been left out it would have been way better! (I like peanut butter but it just seemed to take away from the other delicious flavors instead of add to them.)   The part of the shake I was looking forward to the most was the chocolate covered bacon! Sadly, the piece that came with the shake tasted burnt. (This coming from someone who likes their bacon very well done!) But when we mentioned it to our server he was very nice and brought us out two more pieces of chocolate covered bacon to make up for it. And those ones tasted better. =)  Speaking of the service...it was great. This is the reason for the 4 stars. The atmosphere is lovely. They are very attentive on filling up your water glass and making sure you enjoyed everything. It was great till the end, when we wanted to get our check...which took a while. But I don't hold that against them...our server seemed to have too many tables to look after.   I hope to stop in again to try their food when I have more time.

Love, love, love Arizona Spa Girls!!!  I can't say enough good things about them. Lisa, the owner is amazing and so nice. She organizes the best events and deals for all of us spa loving girls (and guys) in Arizona. If you like to be pampered, and who doesn't, you must sign up for their email list and follow them on facebook.   Lots of great articles on spa treatments, coupons to try out services, events to check out new places and my absolute favorite, Summer Spa Series!  I always enjoy a good massage but rarely can justify treating myself to a spa day at a local spa. It's just so expensive! Until Spa Girls that is. Their summer spa series is a great, affordable way to check out a spa you have been wanting to try. You get to go to a great kick-off event where you get a goody bag filled with great samples, coupons, etc. As well as food, cocktails and mini services. Then you go back sometime in the following month for your spa day. Oh, and a part of your ticket purchase goes to charity! So you can feel good about being good to yourself and others!  I can not recommend this enough. Check it out, you will not be disappointed!!

I loved this place and will definitely be back.   Super friendly service. Lots of choices on the menu I wanted to try. Great for my vegan/veggie/gluten free friends, but plenty of options for everyone else too.  They have cucumber water, if that is your thing. I thought it was a nice touch but I am not a fan of cucumbers. Our waitress was more than happy to get me cucumber free water upon request.  I ordered the combo plate where you get to pick 4 items of your choosing. Everything was tasty and it is a good way to get a variety.  One side note - I tried my friend's spinach dip. I was not a fan of that one item. Other than that though, no complaints.  I can't wait to go back and try the other things I wanted on the menu.

To start off...I am not a big fan of burgers. It is about the last thing I will pick as a food option given a choice. Well we came here for a burger one night and wow, I was impressed. The burger was delicious!!! We both got the BBQ, Bacon and Cheddar burger. The best parts of this burger were the haystack onions and the bacon. I got the BBQ sauce on the side. The burger was SO juicy! The fries were delicious. The staff went out of their way to be super friendly and helpful.   Now if given the choice...I just may pick a burger as an option to eat, so long as it is at a Smashburger.

I went to the grand opening of the new location of Primp and Blow with high hopes. They sent me an e-mail for the kick off event advertising free eyebrow waxing and make-up applications. The e-mail was quite timely because I was in need of having my eyebrows waxed.   When I got there about 5:20pm they seemed quite busy and disorganized. Which honestly, I can understand for a grand opening so I tried to cut them a little slack. When I asked the girl at the front desk about eyebrow waxing she seemed unsure what I was talking about, said she would write down my name and ask, that I should check back with her in 10-15 minutes. When I checked back the next girl I talked to had put me on the list and said it would be about 15 minutes to just come and check back at the desk. After another 15 minutes I checked back and got the same response. This happened a few times. I finally was taken back to have my eyebrows waxed around 6:20pm. Yes, an hour after I got there. Thnakfully they had some yummy food and good music for the grand opening so still trying to give them the benefit of the doubt here.   The girl that took me back never introduced herself, so I do not know the name of the person I am reviewing. At the very beginning I explained to her my brows are very simple, I just do a little underneath and a little in between my brows. I told her I didn't need shaping, just keep the shape I have and clean up the hair underneath my brow.   The first thing she does is put wax ABOVE my eyebrow. As you know, once wax is applied there is only one way it is coming off. :-( So she waxed the top of one brow even though I specifiaclly told her just underneath and between. Yikes, but can't undo it now.  Then she does between and underneath, does a quick pluck of a few strays and says she is done. Um ok...I've never had them not hand me a mirror when they are done.... bad sign. So I hop up to look in the mirror only to find out that she went way thinner than the natural shape of my brows! Way thinner than I ever go. When I mention this to her she say "wow, and I never shape, I just follow the line of the brow." Well....that's not true because mine are now scary thin. =( Nothing I can do to get them back but just wait. And hope they grow back in the way I used to have them.   So while I was clearly not happy with my thin brows (even though I am still trying as best I can to be nice at this point) I didn't even receive an apology from her. Nothing...   I was very disappointed in my experience here and will not be returning to have anything waxed in the future.  On a side note, a few friends went that night for blowouts and make-up applications. They were split. A couple liked their hair and not their make-up, a couple liked their make-up and not their hair. And one friend left nearly in tears because she hated both her hair and make-up so much. Not so great for opening night when you are trying to do your best to get return customers.

What originally brought me to this place was an AZ Spa Girl event. The event was fun with mini services and food and I bought a special they had to try Crybaby eyelash treatment for half price.   My friend and I returned the other day to get our Crybaby applied. This is a temporary mascara that lasts for 2-3 weeks. According to The Beauty Scene it is a local product and I love to support local!  The treatment itself was nice. They lay you in on a vibrating pod bed which is pretty relaxing.   The Crybaby itself is ok. I probably wouldn't do it again at full price but it was fun to try. It's nice to cut a step out of your beauty routine each day. Most people will still touch up with regular mascara though. I have been since a couple spots were missed on the application.   I really appreciated the complimentary eyebrow wax that Janel gave me but I was really shocked she didn't ask my permission first.... What if I didn't want them waxed or if I was growing them out? It would have been too late because it was already on my face.   My overall impression was everyone there was very friendly and helpful. The service was enjoyable even though I don't think the product is for me. The bonus wax was super nice but hopefully they ask before wax is on the skin next time, just in case.

We only had a chance to stop in here briefly for June's milkshake shop but I am looking forward to coming back to try the food. The tots look delish. Can't wait to try them!   I love the decor of this place! So many fun elements and a great view of downtown.

Thanks to Lindsey for another great Yelp event. And thanks to Mood Swings for having us Yelpers. It was a fun night filled with champagne, appetizers and mini spa services.   The chair massage was great! They were even so nice as to let me get the mini manicure. I wasn't sure if I would be able to since I had shellac nail polish on my hands and I know it is a pain to remove...but they said no problem and just had me soak my nails for 10 minutes. Thank you!   I look forward to coming back for a mani/pedi or a massage!

I was not a particular fan of this place. Went on a Friday evening after work. A friend wanted to try it because we always enjoy supporting new, local places.  They do have a very large selections of beer but the process is very confusing. All of the beers on tap are written on a very large chalkboard above the bar. They use several different colors of chalk for each selection making it very hard to read. It may be easier if they pick one color of chalk for each type of beer, that way it is easy to find what you want. Or have #1-5 be one type of beer, #6-10 another and so on. My boyfriend spent so long trying to find a beer on the board because of this. Two of our friends were so overwhelmed with the way the selections were presented they just asked the server to surprise them with a choice.   The acoustics in the place are terrible. It was so loud inside that it was hard to carry on a conversation at the table.   Also, no happy hour. This would be a great way to draw in an after work crowd.

This is the Starbucks located on the 1st floor of the WP Carey School of Business at ASU. It's funny to think that we have our very own Starbucks, considering there is one in the MU which is the next building over. But when you need coffee, you need coffee!!   Always quick friendly service. Try to stop by at non-peak times. Sometimes the line can get all the way to the door.

This review is based on the franchise concept of Steak 'n Shake. The negative reviews comparing it to a full version of Steak 'n Shake do not do it justice because it can not compare, different concept, limited menu, different service. At first, I was a little disappointed but when I asked the employee she explained the differences between the Signature and full version.   The burger was tasty, which is a lot coming from me because I am not a big burger person. I was slightly disappointed because the burger I ordered was supposed to come with crispy onion strings and I didn't realize they were missing until I was reheating my leftovers.  The fries are delicious. Perfect amount of salt and crispiness.  The shake was ok. Can't go wrong with a ice cream shake. But just average...probably not worth the price.  The food is very affordable but the shakes are a bit spendy, in my opinion.   I will definitely be back.

The WP Carey School of Business is a great school. Highly ranked and you will get a great education.  It has the perfect location on campus. Right next to the gym and the MU. We even have our own Starbucks. Anything you want or need is right there.
