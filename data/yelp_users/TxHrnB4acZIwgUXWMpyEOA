I used to live walking distance away from Aunt C's, and it was always a good time no matter what night we'd pay a visit even before the bocce ball court was installed.  The prices I think are a little inflated for their attachment to the Squaw Peak Hilton but as a regular you figure out that the flour chips and salsa fill you up VERY well and a couple of cold beers/margarita's go a long way with an appetizer and can be considered a meal.    There may have been (very) few slip-ups over the years of visiting thus the 4 outta 5. But I have to admit we had our wedding rehearsal dinner here in the back room and they handled everything exceptionally from the whoops, we need another table, to wowing my new family here in AZ as well as my family from back east with great food and sopapillas (yum!), as well as keeping the margarita pitchers filled all night.  The outdoor patios and gardens make this place feel as though it's your own back yard, keep up the good work Aunt C's!!!!!!!!!!!

Uncle Sam's cheese steaks are great... but don't try anything else.  I thought I'd try a stromboli which is rare to find here in AZ as an ex-east coaster.  I walked in and placed an order to go which is also probably a bad idea due to the fact that the person taking my order didn't listen.  An additional mistake is not checking my order and catching it before I left but I ended up with a calzone which has ricotta cheese which I hate.  I had two bites and threw it away.  The crust is tasteless and somehow the steak tasted so bland outside of that fresh roll.  May not be back for awhile.
