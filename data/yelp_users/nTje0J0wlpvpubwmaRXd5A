Coming here is a treat, I definitely look forward to having lunch here when ever I get a chance... The staff is great and the food is yummy my fav is the Teriyaki Chicken Wrap :) with some fruit on the side! Definitely a nice place to have lunch with your friends. Try to avoid the rush so go before or after, because its a small place not much seating and when its packed its packed and kinda noisy you can barely hear yourself think much less have a conversation with someone but I guess that just shows Its popular at lunch time ;-)

As a former starbucks barista I know only to expect the best from starbucks but this particular location is my least fav the drinks always taste bad and i leave unhappy so i gave them a few trys and each time they failed so i will no longer visit this location.

Ok so I always like to give second chances but 3rd time you mess up Im kinda over it. I have had plenty of problems with this location, from messing up my order to over charging me to delivery problems. I had a driver say he couldn't come up to the 3rd floor to bring me my pizza that I had to go down to him and get it, if thats the case I should have just picked up the order myself. Then another one had nerve to forget my drinks and wanted to still charge me for them and expected a tip. Obviously customer service is not their priority!

Worst Applebee's ever, this location reminded me why I stopped eating at this chain period. First the wait for the food was long and they weren't even busy second we asked for medium rare on our sirloin and all our meat was well done. drinks never got refilled we ordered mixed drinks that took over 30 min to get. Oh and the manager asked us what kinda sauce we wanted and I guess he forgot to bring us the A1 cause he never came back. Our waitress wasn't attentive. Applebee's is not the spot like it use to be years ago. This location sucks take your business somewhere else!
