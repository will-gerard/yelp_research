I'm not the type of person to leave reviews, and this is my first one... ever. I get my car detailed every couple of months because I am a clean freak with an extra sensitive sense of smell, so I can say this with the utmost authority: This place is absolutely INCREDIBLE! My vehicle looked and smelled better than it did when I purchased it at the dealership! Their customer service is 5-star! I've already spread the word to friends and family, but I want to tell the world! I highly, highly recommend Deluxe Detail & Tint. They will not only meet your expectations, but they will blow them out of the water!

Everyone that works here is so happy and nice!!! I just got a matching tire (got a flat yesterday) to my set of Pirelli Tires for only $45! The set of 4 at Discount Tire cost me almost $700. I'm blown away! I waited WAY less time too! Every time I go to Discount, I plan on waiting at least 2 hours. I waited here less than one hour. THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! Oh and they have a shop dog, Toyo!

This is my favorite Anthropologie location aside from San Francisco (multiple stories of heaven)! The manager is absolutely amazing! I love her so much! She has remembered me from years and years ago of me shopping at the Scottsdale. I truly feel like a VIP every time I come by to shop. A while back, I was ordering some curtains and I mentioned an online-only chandelier I had my eye on. A month or so later, she called me and let me know that while they were re-doing their bedroom display, she found the same chandelier I wanted tucked behind other supplies in their storage room. She offered to sell it to me and even gave me a bit of a discount for a few scrapes and a little dust. I was blown away! The chandelier now is the focal point of my room, and I love it so much! Not only are the products they sell amazing and unique, but their customer service can't be beat!

This place is super dirty... So dirty that it smells. Staff (hate to say it) looked like they hadn't showered in at least a week. Plus, there was a GIANT cockroach on the ceiling. I was skeeved out. I couldn't wait to get out of there. My dirty diet coke is going straight to the trash.
