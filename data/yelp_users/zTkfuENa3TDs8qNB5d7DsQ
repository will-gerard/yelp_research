Pong Pong is just what everyone has stated it is: Chinese Fast Food, BUT if you like Shrimp Lo Mein like I ENJOY Shrimp Lo Mein, you'll understand why i pass other places to go here. Most inexpensive places will give you inexpensive shrimp...which are usually small and not very tasty. Pong Pong, on the other hand, has the BIGGEST shrimp of any other Chinese place in it's price range.  You can stand-by and watch your food get made if you like. The view of the kitchen when you are in the restaurant practically guarantees cleanliness. And one final warning....your food will be fresh and it will be HOT !!

I was impressed with the atmosphere at this dentist's office. The staff was super friendly...but not fake. Dr. Fulcher was gentle, professional, and made me aware of everything he was doing before he did it. I will actually look forward to my next trip to the dentist !!

We utilized this company for a catered lunch group function for 40 people and I have to say, we are so glad we did. Our event was on a Saturday and even though they are closed on Saturdays, the owner still met with me to pick up the food at the predetermined time. Everything was neatly wrapped and marked and all the food was very fresh and met our expectations.

This location could use a visit from Chef Gordon! After being seated outdoors, I ordered 4 things: Wings, Garlic Cheese Bread, Fries, and a Diamond Back Triple Pizza. After 15 minutes, the pizza comes out, which immediately ruined the idea and purpose of an APPETIZER... I was on my second piece of pizza when the fries and garlic bread arrived. By the time the wings arrived, we weren't really even hungry anymore. We still tipped the waitress $10 and wrote it off on the idea that everything won't always be perfect in life.   This is where you earned less than one star SoNY.. That night, we are Black Friday shopping for a big ticket item and we realize they charged us the $40.54 for our meal and also authorized our card for another $112.00...which made the difference of getting the TV at the price I wanted and have waited months to purchase.   When I called the manager the next day, he assured me that it was just a mistake and the money would go back on my account after the bank released the authorization. DUDE, THAT WAS $112 of MY MONEY that you prevented me from accessing when I needed it. Furthermore, when I told him of my experience dining at his establishment his only comment about a pizza coming out 20 minutes before my wings was, "Well, that's weird.."   No, what's weird is that you would allow someone to have an experience in your establishment that GUARANTEES they won't return and all you can say is "That's weird" Streets of New York is not worth the hassle for mediocre food and poor service. AVOID THIS PLACE is you value your hard-earned money.

I tried this barter organization for one of my companies and the year I had my account left a bad taste in my mouth. Like the time I had canvas stretched photos enlarged and paid $45 each for 8 of them, while the company had a sidewalk sign in their lobby advertising a $35 price for the exact same thing I was getting. Or the time they posted a REFURBISHED security system on their Facebook page for $220 and I found out after the fact, that it was being shipped from Texas and it cost me $220+$15shipping+their $22.00 VCA fee= $257.00 for something I could of got off Amazon for 202.99 (shipped FREE) that wasn't a refurb. Or the time they posted 30 rolls of paper towel on their Facebook page for $120 (YES, $4.00 a roll) and when I commented that it showed everything that was wrong with this organization, it was promptly deleted. Rather than addressing the issues they have, they delete it.  Take it from someone who gathered over $6,000 in trade dollars and spent over a year as a member of this organization: unless you like getting gouged on pricing, surprise shipping charges, and being censored for daring to say something about it, AVOID this company!

Living in a 4 Bdrm house with 3 other roommates can be like going to the dentists when it comes to cleaning.Nobody wants to clean up after anyone else, so generally speaking, it stays pretty dirty. Upon having the opportunity to get discounted cleaning on their membership program, I decided to go ahead and pay for bi-monthly cleanings for the next 6 months. Today was the cleaners first day here and Elisa did a great job!! I showed her the common areas of the home and she went to work. Were not terribly picky, because we realize the house IS dirty... but everything I have experienced with this company said I needed to tip her and come here to share my experience for other's sake.

The first time i ever had Fat Boys Pizza I was AMAZED, but couldn't understand what it was about the food. After some careful thought I decided this: Corporate Amerika is all about consistency, so when you order a Papa J's or Pizza Cut pizza, it's going to taste the same no matter where you live. They do this, thanks in part, to processed ingredients and recipes which are canned, shipped, and sold.  Fat Boys is a little different. The cheese is REAL (not processed) and you can taste the difference when a crust is not frozen. At first, I thought it was a tad greasy, but I now crave the greasy pepperoni cause i know that means it's REAL and not processed crapola that's had the grease removed to appease the masses.   If you want something that is new and different than the corporate pizza pies you've been eating.....try Fat Boys !!

New Year's Eve was not what we had intended this year, thanks in part to what must be the worst bar in the world. There were less than 20 people here between 8-9 PM and THREE tables with 2 stools each. Their "Grand Opening" celebration was everything but, as they only had the ability to seat 6 people, but I was NOT one of them. A very limited drink selection which could only be gotten after the bartender decided to put down their smart-phone. Needless to say, we didn't stay long and I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.
