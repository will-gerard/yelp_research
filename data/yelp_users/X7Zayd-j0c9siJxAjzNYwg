I ordered these wings three times just to make sure before I made a comment. The works wings, crispy are the best wings I've ever had anywhere. Absolute perfection....finished on the grill the way a wing should be.

These folks are AWESOME! Great customer service and very friendly. Honest people. If you are looking for some cool pieces or need something repaired this is your spot. Gotta love the small mom and pop shops that are still around. Check them out!

Crust taste like a saltine cracker, sauce is just as flavorless. My dog wouldn't even eat it. You're better off buying a frozen pizza. Don't waste your money. $22 for 14" of crap.

Overpriced, tiny portions. Whiskey sour was good and the lasagne was alright. Decent atmosphere. I'm pretty sure the waiter had a fake accent.

Awesome stuff! Its better than any other electronic device protection I've ever used and it has a lifetime warranty. The customer service was top notch and informative. They professionally install it for you so you don't mess it up yourself. They also have carbon fiber color skins to change the color of your device, I chose Black.
