My husband and I just moved to Phoenix from Northern California, the land of good Thai, and Wild Thaiger was the first Thai place we tried in the Valley of the Sun. Let's just say that the quality ingredients and enticing flavors made us feel a little less homesick. The prices were not rock-bottom, but I am always willing to pay a little more for good food and larger portions, both of which Wild Thaiger offers. The papaya salad was refreshing and really authentic, although the shrimp were a little fishy for our tastes. The soup we had was also very flavorful and best of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken. And lest I forgot alcohol - the crowning glory of any meal - the specialty drinks offered seemed like they would be too sweet or weak, so my sister and I got Cosmos. They were appropriately strong and actually quite good! All around, a really great experience.

We went back here this past Saturday night with a friend from out of town and liked it just as much as we did when we tried it a few months ago. My Cosmopolitan was just as big and tasty as it was last time, and the service was still attentive and friendly. My friend is a pescetarian/flexitarian (doesn't eat meat except for fish), and we were really pleased to find that all of the dishes we ordered that we usually get with meat were still absolutely delicious. Specifically, the Pad See Ew (which we usually get with chicken or beef) was still savory with just the fried tofu and perhaps even more amazing, the Mussaman curry (which usually comes with a deliciously braised beef) was still really flavorful and was complimented nicely by the tofu. Even after trying a decent number of other Thai places in Phoenix, we like Wild Thaiger for the full bar, consistently good flavors, great service, and fun atmosphere, and we will definitely continue to come here often.

My two-star rating for Sam's Cafe is based on our experience there for happy hour in the bar. If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I'll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour.   We went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam's Cafe.   The next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out.   The third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something "southwestern." None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid's and McCormick & Schmick's are two great examples.   The final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, "Are you sure you don't want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?" Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you're having such a good time. As persuasive as his "selling techniques" were, we weren't (having a good time), so we didn't (order more).

Since I love sushi and have been eating all varieties of Asian food since high school, I tend to avoid ordering teriyaki dishes when I go to Japanese restaurants. Not only do I find the teriyaki sauce that Japanese places typically use to be too sweet, but there is always so much - sushi, edamame, seaweed salads - at good Japanese places that I would rather spend my money on and fill my stomach with. Going forward, Blue Fin will be an exception to this no-teriyaki rule of mine. In fact, I may even go there *because* of the teriyaki.   My husband and I stopped in for lunch. We both ordered the teriyaki combos (served with salad and rice) - he got beef and I got the white-meat chicken. Both were priced around $6. The food took a while to come out, and there were no seats left inside, so we had to sit outside, but the owner/manager was super nice, offering to re-seat us inside when tables became available and to bring us our food when it was ready.   When she brought our plates, we were shocked at how huge the portions were. Yes, there was tons of salad (with a delicious sesame dressing) and white rice, but there was also a *lot* of meat. My husband and I believe ourselves to have larger-than-average appetites, but we could barely finish one plate and vowed to split one next time. So, the portions were huge, but the teriyaki flavor was also amazing. It was subtle and flavorful but not too sweet, serving to bring out the flavor of the meat and not just provide a sticky and overwhelming glaze. The black sesame seeds and spicy powder they put on the table were nice add-ons but weren't even necessary since the sauce was so flavorful. I am, however, docking The Blue Fin a star because the quality of my husband's beef wasn't as high as that of the chicken; it was fatty and hard to chew.   After years of avoiding teriyaki, The Blue Fin makes me actually crave it. Plus, it's affordable and has a super-friendly staff. I will definitely be back.

I think Calamari F. pretty much summed it up. OSF serves absolutely inedible "Italian" food that is far worse than the usual Americanized Italian fare you get at chain Italian restaurants like Olive Garden. I would have rather had seafood alfredo from Red Lobster. The prices were also very high. The only good thing about our experience was the "free" spumoni ice cream that comes with every entree purchase. Avoid at all costs.

From the street, my husband and I thought Zoe's Kitchen would be like Panera - that is, we thought it would serve fast, flavorful, and good-quality lunch fare. None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross.   We stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option.   Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara.   We sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a "few more minutes." She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!  It wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches. If they can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in order volume, they should hire more staff members.   As if the slow service wasn't painful enough, my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black). After one bit of the accompanying slaw, which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy, I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager, handed her the plate, and asked her to refund me for my plate. To her credit, she complied, but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return.   My husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable. The bread was a plain roll, the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed, and the "Greek" marinara tasted like Prego. The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chips!  I guarantee you that we won't be back to Zoe's Kitchen. We are huge fans of fast, casual, and fresh lunch food, but we found the food at Zoe's to be anything but.

I have not been to a business-related convention or event here, nor have I managed a booth during a business-related convention or event here, so I can't directly comment on the experience of attending or organizing a conference here. However, having handled some of the tradeshow logistics at my last job, I can tell you that the parking, setup, staffing, and overall accessibility of a conference venue can really make or break the day of anyone who is managing or staffing a booth, and it seems that the layout of the Phoenix Convention Center, as well as the fairly low-key vibe of this part of downtown, would make this a decent venue for business and industry events.   My husband and I stopped in here last Friday to walk around the Arizona Home and Building Expo (summary: some cool design ideas; lots of over-priced offers and garage cabinet makers; better to go on Kudzu.com, Angie's List, and online forums such as Yelp and get people's actual feedback as to contractors and vendors they've used). The architecture is unique and compelling, the grounds seem clean and well-maintained, and the inside is relatively easy to navigate. The staff we encountered was also friendly and helpful. Absent hands-on experience with participating in a conference here for business-related reasons, I would have to say this place seems like a great conference/convention venue.

I was looking to create some custom signs for my themed birthday party and turned to FASTSIGNS because it is located just a few blocks from my house. I was really glad I ended up choosing them because my experience was really great.   To start with, when I emailed the online quote request, I got a prompt - and very thorough - response from Jeff. Unlike some businesses that respond to quote requests with a zillion other questions, Jeff took a stab right away at specs/materials and an estimate. This made me so much more likely to engage and really saved me a lot of back-and-forth (which I just don't have time to do during the work week).   When I picked up the signs, they were great quality and the work was as I pictured it. I also thought the prices were reasonable for custom signs.   Overall, I was very happy with my FASTSIGNS experience and would definitely go back for any future sign needs!

I'll echo everyone else here in saying that all of the previous reviews were written before "Jimmychu" started working here and really started impacting the culture and feeling of the place. I hadn't been there back in the day (even though it's a few blocks from my house) because of the negative reviews but decided to take a chance on it when I had been drinking, couldn't drive but decided I wanted to get my nails done (don't judge, OK?).   I walked over to Cali Nails at 6:45 (they close at 7), but was greeted with a smile and service right away (by the other Jimmy).   It took about 1.25 hours and $50 to get a fantastic gel manicure (from Jimmychu) and a good spa pedicure (from Rose). I was very pleased with the shape of my nails and I like how just because a few were short, he didn't try to trim them all down. It's been almost two weeks, and they're still looking good. Plus, as other reviewers, were mentioned the two Jimmys are just a lot of fun and genuinely seem to enjoy their jobs, which made it really fun to be there.   I will definitely be back. Maybe I'll just make it my post-HH habit! :)

Although I love to enjoy a glass (or a bottle) of wine late at night or with a fancier dinner, I usually prefer a good cocktail, especially when I'm at happy hour planning to take the edge off of a long, stressful day.   For that reason, I tend not to frequent wine bars like Cheuvront during happy hour. However, when my husband and I met Kristin S and her husband there for happy hour a few weeks ago, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Cheuvront also has a full bar. Unfortunately, the discounted specialty cocktails they offered during happy hour weren't particularly appealing (I tend to shy away from martinis with names like "Grapetini"), and the cucumber mojito I did try was way too sweet, but it was really nice to know that they had a full bar.   They also featured a small happy hour menu with 7-8 items for $5 each. Unlike some other reviewers, I wasn't that impressed with the mac and cheese (it didn't have nearly enough cheese and had none of the crispiness I usually associate with the homemade version of the dish). We also found the mini pizza to be just average (although the slightly creamy tomato sauce was delicious).   However, the Ancho Pork Empanadas with a side of orange marmalade were absolutely delectable, and the pate was a really generous portion for the price. We also enjoyed the dinner salad we ordered off the regular menu (the shallot vinaigrette was delicious) and the Pumpkin Bread Pudding, which was a little dry but had great flavor. Our dining companions both had the Salad Niscoise, featuring ahi tuna, which looked filling but light.   In terms of service and atmosphere, we were pretty impressed. We appreciated the fact that we could sit a regular table and order off the happy hour menu, and our server was definitely available when we needed him. I also loved the urban but not over-the-top decor; there are some nice loft-like touches (slick floors, metal accents, ceiling beams) throughout that fit in beautifully with the residential Artisan Lofts that occupy the rest of the building.    Cheuvront is a solidly enjoyable place to kick back after a long day of work. Although some of their happy hour food and cocktails could use some improvement, I was impressed by the atmosphere, service, and most of the dishes. I will definitely be back to give this place another try.

Chinese food has become so Americanized that it's easy to forget (or never know) about the flavors and preparation styles that characterize authentic and regionally-specific Chinese food. A few months ago, I had a great experience learning about authentic Sichuan from Helen Y when she invited me to join her at Szechwan Palace in the Chinese Cultural Center, and this past weekend, she invited my husband and me, along with some other very fortunate Yelpers, including David S B, Jason W, and Alexander C, to eat some more amazing and authentic Chinese at Lao Ching Hing (according to her review, their Chinese menu features mostly Shanghainese food with some Sichuan dishes and a few Cantonese dishes).   Just as at Szechwan Palace, the atmosphere of the restaurant was nothing special. In fact, it was a little messy, at least in the little area with the large round table where they sat us - we were surrounded by all of these rows of boxes and random containers. Oh, well - atmosphere aside, the service was friendly and prompt (our waters were always kept full), and the food was incredible. So that you are able to order some more authentic items, I'll give you a breakdown of what Helen ordered for us off the Chinese menu (which she has so generously translated and posted to the business info section of this review):   *Cold jellyfish in scallion oil - This had a nice semi-chewy texture (reminded me of octupus) and a vinegary sauce. Reminded me of kim chi, which I love.  *Wok-fried rice cakes - Little oval noodles (same texture as Chow Fun) in a savory light sauce with fresh, crunchy vegetables *1/2 crispy duck - Tender meat with crispy skin; served with Hoisin sauce *"Ants Climbing Up a Tree" - Unusual name but tasty dish. It was vermicelli (thin noodles) with a minced meat and chili sauce.  *Whole salt and pepper shrimp - These were crispy and had the perfect amount of salt and pepper coating. The shrimp themselves were a little fishy, though. Highly recommend eating them whole (including the eyes!) *Beef tendon and tripe in scallion oil - I wasn't wild about the texture, but the spicy sauce was really savory and flavorful. *Soup dumplings - Little dumplings filled with soup broth that you have to eat in one big bite. They were good, but I preferred the ones that we had at Szechwan Palace.  *Fish pieces w/ sauce - I could be wrong, but I think these were  the "spicy soybean paste with sliced fish" from the menu. They were very bony and difficult to eat, but I enjoyed the flavor.  *Peking spare ribs - Delicious! Had the most savory sauce and really tender meat.  *Drunken chicken - Not a huge fan of this dish. The chicken was a bit dry, instead of falling off the bone, and the skin wasn't crispy at all.  *Chopped Shanghainese greens with tofu in sesame oil  - Served cold. Was really flavorful and light and would be great as a vegetarian appetizer.  *Sauteed "snake" gourd with soy beans - To the best of my knowledge, this consisted of pieces of sauteed squash with soy beans in a clear, mild sauce. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was the perfect complement.  *Steamed and deep-fried bun - This came in the shape of a long roll that we had to cut into individual pieces. It was delicious doughy and slightly crispy on the outside and was fabulous dipped in some chili sauce.  *Green onion pancake - This has always been one of my favorite authentic Chinese dishes and has a wonderful mealy texture. Again, excellent dipped in chili sauce! *Deep-fried shredded potato - Being that we went at 11:30 on a Sunday, my eye was drawn to this hash-brown-like dish. Didn't regret my choice because it was delicious. Comprised of undercooked and crunchy potato slices in a sauce with chiles.   One note - nothing we got was ridiculously spicy, but the chili sauce that comes on the table allows you to spice everything to taste and added flavor (and not just mind-numbing heat) to every dish I tried.   15 dishes! I may have forgotten to mention a dish or two, but as you can see, we had a veritable Shanghai feast! In this day and age, feasts usually cost a pretty penny, but the 9 of us walked out having only spent $20 each. Paying that little money for so much incredible and authentic food is just freaking incredible. I guarantee that my husband and I will be back!

Cha-ching! I got lucky my first time at Szechwan Palace! I had Helen Y. with me (Jason W. was along for the culinary experience as well), and she helped us navigate the Chinese menu, explaining about Szechwan cuisine and selecting some different dishes for us to try. I don't remember everything we tried, but the two standout dishes were definitely the fish filets and the water-boiled beef. The fish was cooked perfectly, with a creamy texture and a simple, sweet flavor. The water-boiled beef was spicy and so satisfying - my sinuses totally felt clearer as I ate it! I also enjoyed the soup buns. I'm not a big lamb fan, but the lamb riblets that Helen described in her review were good and would probably be a big hit with anyone who doesn't mind the gamier taste.   The restaurant's atmosphere isn't anything to write home about, but the service was decent and the prices (about $15 a person) were definitely really reasonable for the amount and quality of the food we tried. Thanks to Helen for introducing me to this place. When I go back with my husband (or anyone else who can't read the Chinese menu), at least I will have a few already-established favorites to order!

Blech! Eek! Yuck! Went here last Saturday with my compadres, Myles M, Kristin S and a few others. We had been day drinking substantially and still thought the food was barely edible. Having grown up in California, I am completely aware of the variety of "Mexican food" that exists. I've had true authentic food with cactus, Americanized Tex Mex like they serve at places like Chevy's and drive-through places like Filiberto's, and I'm ok with eating at the less authentic end of the spectrum. That being said, I still expect my food to be made with decent ingredients, to be flavorful and to be a good value for the money. And the food at Macayo's is none of those.   The special shrimp burrito we got had a decently spicy sauce, but the tortilla was soggy and greasy. The Spanish rice was the worst I've ever had. My friend's "grilled veggie" fajitas were overcooked, mushy, STEAMED veggies like carrots and broccoli. What a curse to be a vegetarian in this joint! The house salsa was OK but I've had better from a jar.   The only saving grace of this place was that it was crowded and lively on a Saturday night (always something I miss dining in Central Phoenix). The pitcher of margaritas we got was also decent and not too sweet.   Sorry, Obama, and sorry to everyone else who gave this place a decent review. Macayo's sucks and I'm not afraid to say it.

Kudos Karsh's!   Recently, for Stevey P's birthday, a friend suggested getting him a cake with a photo of his favorite person: Brenda Dickson. If you don't know who she is, search for her on You Tube. Then, search for "Brenda Dickson parody" and watch that. Now you're in the loop.   I volunteered to take care of ordering the cake. Little did I know just how difficult it would be to find a bakery in Phoenix that makes photo cakes! I finally stumbled upon Karsh's and was pleasantly surprised not only by the fact that they made photo cakes, but by how friendly and competent the person I ordered from was. They proved this ten times over when they didn't laugh when I said that I wanted the cake to say "Welcome to My Face." Like I said--you have to watch the video to understand.   Anyway, the prices were also very reasonable: it was only $40 for a photo cake with chocolate cake and chocolate filling that would feed 8-12. Also, I only ordered a few days in advance and they said it would be no problem to have the cake ready in time.   My great experience with Karsh's was complete when I went to pick up the cake and had the woman on duty ask me what "Welcome to My Face" meant. I told her exactly what I told you, my trusty Yelper: watch the video. Once you do, you'll understand. And if you don't, well we'll still have our memory of the delicious chocolatey cake with the face of a wannabe fashion icon who tattoos eyebrows on cats.

I have consistently great service experiences here and haven't chosen to go to an auto service chain for my VW as a result. I'm deducting a star for the shrinking hours (anyone remember when this place was open until 9pm-ish on weekdays?), but the people are always friendly and helpful and treat me (with my GTI under warranty) no differently than when I paid out of pocked for my previous VW (Rabbit). They've even thrown in a complimentary car wash a few times. 4 stars!

I'm giving Apollo's four stars because it has a lot of things I look for in a bar. It's clean and well-maintained (including the "Goddesses" restroom). It also has friendly staff, a diverse group of patrons, a great outdoor patio (featuring appropriately-themed "Roman" columns), and perhaps, most importantly, features karaoke on Thursday - Saturday nights. My husband and I went on a Friday night for karaoke with Stevey P and Kristin S and their SOs and had a great time.   The singers' talent is definitely better than your average karaoke dive bar, and the song choice was good, but as an avid karaoke singer, I didn't like the fact that there was no separate stage or area carved out for the current singer to stand. We just had to stand by our chairs or between tables and strain our necks to look up at the lyrics. Karaoke also wasn't the central focus of the place, with much *very loud* talking and socializing going on in spite of (or because of?) the singing. I'm not going to penalize Apollo's for this too much, though, because I know only serious karaoke freaks like me want it to be the focus.    One other complaint - some of us in the group were also a little disappointed with our weak our drinks were - I don't know if this was just crowd control, but with a final tab of $70 or so, we expected to be feeling a little more loopy than we did for most of the night. Speaking of feeling loopy, we were appreciative of how helpful the bartenders were when we wanted to call a cab, and one came fairly quickly after they called one for us.   Apparently, the company that does karaoke here is the same as the one that does it at Kobalt (another gay bar in Midtown's Park Central complex). If you are into a social and dynamic bar scene with a pretty diverse crowd and karaoke as part of the experience, you will really like Apollo. However, if you ever want to go somewhere a little more low-key and really focus on the karaoke part, you might want to check Kobalt out.

I totally agree with Thomas S. that Pier 1 has gotten really over-priced for its own good. I also think that they could stand to expand their offerings to include some furnishings and decor that are a little more modern/urban (like the loft collection West Elm just introduced). I think they could update their offerings without messing up their overall concept. I get kind of tired of seeing the same dark wood furniture pieces with ethnic embossing over and over again, especially when one dresser has a $600 price tag.   That being said, Pier 1 is an awesome place to pick up accessories to complete or add to your current furniture and decor. My personal favorites: their reeds/feathers/silk flowers, plates (buy one cool one and display on the stand they sell separately), martini glasses (we have two striped ones displayed on our wet bar), trays, and candles/candle accessories. They also always have a huge variety of colors, which is really helpful if you have something particular in mind; this is not the case at Ikea or Target, which tend to have decor in stock that is only in specific seasonal or featured colors.   This particular location of Pier 1 has a really friendly and helpful staff. When I went a little overboard (spent too much) on a recent trip and brought about half of the stuff back to return, they were really nice about it. A lot of places give you attitude when you return a bunch of items, but they didn't, which I appreciated.

This place definitely has some downsides (food that isn't exactly innovative, less-than-inspiring atmosphere), but it definitely has a lot of good things going for it too. The service is attentive, the grilled fish is fresh and very flavorful, the oysters are awesome (and we all know good oysters are hard to come by in the desert) and only cost $.95 during seafood happy hour (weeknights and weekend days), and the prices are very reasonable given the quality of the fish.   My sister and went here for lunch this past weekend. I had four Miyagi oysters (which, again, were only $.95 because it was noon on Saturday) that were perfectly briny and super-fresh. She had the side salad, which she said was good, although the house dressing had a bit of a funky taste. We both had the rainbow trout and the basil cherry tomatoes and rice for side dishes. The fish itself was so flavorful and not too greasy, although she did report that her portion had a lot of really small bones, and the rice side dish was good. I would recommend avoiding the basil tomatoes, though - even though the tomatoes themselves were fresh, they were absolutely covered in black pepper, which made them inedible. Our server was nice and kept the drink refills coming. For $40 including tip, we had two appetizers, two entrees, and a soda and left very satisfied. If you are looking for innovation or trendy atmosphere, you probably want to go elsewhere, but if you want good-quality seafood and reasonable prices, you will really enjoy the Fish Market.

I found Burland here on Yelp (thanks, guys!) when searching for a jewelry appraiser. While a generally responsible person, I recently dropped my rings in a pool and realized (after my sister found them) that I really needed an updated appraisal to ensure that if I actually had lost the rings, my insurance would pay out the full value. Why does it always take a scare to get me to do the responsible thing? Sigh.   I called earlier on a weekday to get more information and the woman who answered was incredibly helpful. I said I was interested in an appraisal and she promptly let me know the hours the appraiser was available and how much it would cost. Given that you often have to fish for information, I highly appreciated how upfront she was.   I ended up going into the store on a Saturday around noon and was immediately greeted by a very friendly couple, who owned the store. The woman immediately noticed how dirty my rings were and asked if she could clean them - I loved how willing she was to help before even knowing if I was going to buy something.   The owner got me started right away by making copies of my existing diamond certificate and previous appraisal (helpful hint: make sure to bring any similar paperwork you have). Then, the appraiser came out and let me know that he could take care of the appraisal in 45 minutes. I decided to go shopping at Old Navy and come back.   When I got back, the appraiser was done, as promised. (Score another one for honesty!). He walked me through all of his paperwork in detail and then sent me on my way with a smile.   What a great local shop run by genuine and skilled people! I would definitely not hesitate to come back for my future jewelry needs and I highly recommend Burland to others looking to get an appraisal.

McCormick's is my new favorite spot for two of the things that make me the happiest: 1) freshly squeezed and mixed margaritas; and 2) a happy hour that features decent and really cheap food. I could go without the uninspired main menu and the fairly stuffy after-work crowd, but I plan to return as much as possible for the amazing margaritas and ridiculously cheap happy hour food!  I first learned about the restaurant when I posted a thread in the Yelp Phoenix talk forums - I was trying to find out where I could go in Phoenix to get a really good margarita (that is, made with freshly squeezed juices and hand-mixed). A few people (thank you, Jim K. and Natalie G.!) suggested McCormick's, which surprised me because old-school seafood places don't tend to specialize in much besides wine, beer, and old-fashioned drinks like martinis and Manhattans. Anyway, I was thrilled to discover that they were right - that is one perfect margarita!  It was refreshing, strong, and the perfect combination of sweet and sour. When we complimented the bartender (who was really nice and helpful) on the margarita, he explained that they use only freshly squeezed lime and lemon juices, sugar cubes or simple syrup, and tequila. Yum.   On to the happy hour part (happy hour is M-F from 3:30 to 6:30, btw). When we arrived and took a seat at the bar, there were paper menus that featured the list of happy hour appetizers. There were five appetizers that were $1.95 (this time, the choices were: the 1/2 pound burger with fries, blackened fish tacos, fried clam strips, steamed mussels, and a seafood tostada) and several that were $4.95 (pulled pork sandwich, shrimp cocktail, and one or two others that I can't remember). We had the pulled pork sandwich, which was actually surprisingly flavorful, the fried clam strips (crispy and not too fishy), the burger (decent but a little overcooked and dry), and the seafood tostada (just ok). A whole dinner's worth of food for around $11! Even though the food wasn't outstanding, it was definitely solid and along with the margaritas, made for an enjoyable and satisfying happy hour.

We went back to McCormick's happy hour last Friday and were pleased to find that the margaritas and super-discounted food were just as good as we remembered. We had four of the $1.95 plates (some of which had changed since the last time we went) and two of their freshly-squeezed, freshly-mixed margaritas.   The margaritas were also still absolutely  delicious, but we were a little disappointed to find out that they still cost $10 even with well tequila (last time we had gotten Patron and therefore expected a higher price tag). I still recommend trying them if you're a true margarita fan, but just know that you'll have to shell out a pretty penny (5 times as much as the happy hour price for the bruschetta, in fact).   One other note - if you're going to go check this place out (and either smoke or don't mind smoke), go while the weather is still nice but a bit cooler and sit on the patio (the side by the bar is happy hour seating). It was so beautiful outside when we went, the misters were refreshing, and when we looked up, there was a beautiful (and unexpected) view of the mountains across Camelback.

We finally went back to Merc Bar last Saturday night and as I suspected would happen, I liked the place a lot better when it was dark outside! My husband and I took my sister (who was in town for the weekend) to meet a few friends before dinner at Lola Tapas (review to come in a few minutes).   We were the first people in the bar, which was a little awkward at first but kind of nice, since we had a fancy, chic space all to ourselves! We all enjoyed our drinks, including my husband's and my dirty martinis. My only gripe was that they didn't come with the blue cheese olives mentioned on the menu already in them. Instead, the server brought them to our table and then asked if we wanted the olives.   I still don't think I'd linger at Merc Bar for hours (unless I was drinking Red Bull drinks to stay awake!) because I find the vibe just a bit too underground for my tastes, but I will definitely be back for a pre or post dinner drink.

Thai is my favorite cuisine on Earth, and in the four months or so that we've lived in Phoenix, we've tried quite a few places and have assembled a roster of places in the Valley that serve at least decent Thai. I'm happy to say that after eating at Thai Lahna with Jim W. and his wife Audrey, we now have another Thai place besides Swaddee (in Chandler) and Wild Thaiger (in downtown) that we're not just ok with going to but actually excited about.   I'm docking Thai Lahna one star for the *really* slow service (I don't recommend going if you're on the verge of starving or with people you don't have much to say to), the less-than-stellar appetizers (the chicken satay was pretty bland and we've had better angel wings elsewhere), and that damn bright light from cars that were parking that kept blinding us that Jim W. mentioned in his review.   All this aside, Thai Lahna's super-flavorful main dishes merit four stars. The Khung Nahm Prik Pow was filled with high-quality shrimp (rare for Phoenix!), lots of well-chosenand fresh vegetables, and a really complex and rich curry and chili sauce. It was different than any sautee I've had at a Thai restaurant before but incredibly delicious. The Mussaman Curry was also a real standout. The beef wasn't as high-quality or tender as the beef that comes in Wild Thaiger's version of the same dish, but the curry itself was rich, flavorful, and not overly coconutty (if that isn't a word, it should be). The pineapple fried rice was also super satisfying, but be forewarned that if you ask for it spicy (as my husband did), it will be just that - sinus-clearing spicy. My husband and I weren't in love with the Pad Thai (Phaht Thai on their menu) - we prefer it a little more savory and a little less saucey - but it was one of the better we've had in Phoenix and Jim W. is right that the noodles' sweetness was necessary in this case to balance out the intense spiciness of that rice!  Thai Lahna serves authentic and flavorful Thai food that meets our Bay Area standards, and we will definitely be back. We won't, however, come when we are too hungry and we will probably avoid the appetizers and just go straight to the entree good stuff.

Sometimes, an establishment gets an extra star boost for being unique. As the only ice rink in Phoenix, Arcadia Ice Arena is just that kind of place. And, needless to say, in an area that is consistently warm and a goddamn inferno in several months of the year, why shouldn't I reward a place that allows me to enter frigid temperatures and relax by taking a few spins around the ice?   Granted, the place is in a moderately sketchy shopping center and the arena itself is rundown, but the staff is generally nice, the ice is well maintained and the prices are affordable (even before the recent slurry of Groupons). And, yes, I did just use a ice-related word.   The best part about Arcadia Ice Arena? The fantastic bar, Ice House, featuring a ton of different local and craft beers, microwave popcorn, live music on weekend nights, darts and a great view of the rink. What a one-of-a-kind experience to have here in the Valley of the Sun!

My husband and I went here to get the car washed before we headed to some nearby dealers to try to trade it in. As many people have already said, the nonstop sales pitches from the moment we pulled in were really rather irritating. After iterating several times that we were not interested in getting the car detailed or waxed, the sales guy returned at least 3 more times to our vehicle saying that his boss had "authorized" him to lower the price "once again." We didn't give in to his pressure, but it felt very frustrating to have to assert ourselves so many times. The wash itself was satisfactory, but as Jake mentions in his review, the "hassling" and sales pitches made me not want to go back.

This place offers cheap, good eats that are pretty much non-existent at the vast majority of US airports. The veggie sandwich and Thai chicken wrap were both quite good, although the Thai chicken wrap did taste more Chinese than Thai. Each only set us back $6 or so. Service was very friendly. The only thing we didn't enjoy was the supposedly infamous cookies - they were so sweet they left my mouth filled with little sores. Not a great way to end an otherwise very satisfying airport meal.

Anyone who's been to South Phoenix knows that Mexican restaurants in that area are about as ubiquitous as bad drivers in Phoenix. My husband and I have lived in the area for 9 months or so but have always been a bit intimidated by just how much selection there is. To make matters worse, there aren't many Yelp reviews of places around here, so we keep feeling like any choice we make is uninformed. (Whatever did we do before Yelp?!)   One night, we decided to drive down Central and look for the restaurant that was the most crowded with locals. (Naturally, Poncho's was crowded but we have been there before and find it good but not particularly authentic). Las Glorias--a white and blue building with fish painted on it--was packed, so we made a mental note and decided to return. We came back on New Year's Day when it was decidedly less crowded but the food did not disappoint. In fact, it was downright delicious and this place is definitely our new local favorite.   As you can see from the pictures, this place is even more themed inside. There is kitschy nautical decor everywhere--my personal favorite is the lighthouse on the wall that lights up. This place could be covered in real barnacles, though, and I wouldn't care. The food was just that good. To start with, the tortilla chips were hot and fresh out of the oven and the salsa was perfect with the perfect consistency and flavor.   For our entrees, I got the Camarones Culichi ($12.50), and my husband got the Camarón y Filete Empanizado ($12.50), which is essentially breaded fish and shrimp served with rice, beans and salad. My shrimp were the freshest I've had in Phoenix with a sweet flavor and firm texture and the culichi sauce (a spicy green chili cheese sauce) was creamy but spicy at the same time. Even when I had finished the shrimp, I found myself dipping chips into the sauce. Can't let something that good go to waste! My husband's fish and shrimp were also excellent, with a slightly spicy and crunchy breading. They were even better dipped in one of the provided hot sauces (don't remember the name but it had a brownish color and tasted smoky).   Our experience at Las Glorias was so great the first time that we decided to order to go from there recently. It's nice that they have a website with a menu since most local Mexican places do not. That time, we sampled the Camarones a la Diabla (again, great shrimp and kickin' flavor), the Crab Enchiladas w/ green sauce (incredible flavor and not too rich, but we could have gone without the few shell pieces we encountered), and the Ceviche Tostada (super fresh and perfectly spicy and a steal at only $3).   You may have a local Mexican spot you love but there's something distinct and really wonderful about a seafood-only Mexican restaurant with eccentric decor and excellent fresh food. Venture on down Central (yes, south of downtown) and try it for yourself!

Yelpers! You're letting me down here. Why has no one else reviewed Las Glorias yet? There are so many good reasons to go but I'll list a few:  *It's only 10 minutes south of downtown. Yes, it's South Phoenix, but you'll go further for Los Dos Molinos and it's not even that great.  *The people are incredibly nice. They don't speak any English so you'll have to order in Spanish, but they're always polite and smiling when I go in to eat or pick up.  *The food is damn good. Fresh seafood options include incredible ceviche tostadas, mouthwatering Camarones Culichi, grilled fish in garlic sauce and more.  *This place needs the support of more Yelpers to survive. It's weathered the last two years, but I'm always afraid they'll close their doors. And that would be a loss.   Come on, give it a shot! If you don't want to eat in, you can order to go. We've done it many times and the food is always great to have in front of the TV with beer.

The most amazing thing about Ranch Market is that it successfully combines all the disparate elements that people in Phoenix and L.A. (where I grew up) experience about Mexican culture and food into one exciting, colorful, and interesting shopping experience. Growing up, my dad often took me and my sister to local taco stands and Mexican juice places (where they made fresh horchata, agua fresca, smoothies, and juices). We also often made a point to stop at the little street carts where Mexican men would serve up freshly sliced mango, pineapple, and papaya, coat them in lime juice and chili salt, and then pass them on to us for mere pennies. These stands, holes in the wall bursting with locals, and street carts were all part of how I experienced Mexican food growing up, and I absolutely love how Ranch Market re-creates this experience in the context of a full-service market.   When you walk in to the market, we were immediately wowed by all of the colorful decor - streamers, pinatas, signage - and by the very varied selection of meats at the butcher counter. If you are interested, you can get a full-on cow's head for only $29.99! We turned the corner and realized that not only was there aisle upon aisle of dry and canned goods, but that the entire perimeter of the inside of the market was lined with little specialized stands where you could go to buy certain types of items to take home *and* try something right then and there - just like the taco stands and carts of my youth! As an example, you can walk up to the seafood counter and purchase octopus to take home and make a ceviche with, but you can also buy some fresh seafood tacos to eat as you shop! There were similar counters for the dairy, fruit drinks/horchatas, breads/pastries, and desserts categories.   Perhaps even more exciting - there is a full eatery/cafeteria right inside the market that serves affordable and delicious Mexican fare. We ordered some assorted tacos, a carne asada quesadilla, and a drink, and it was only $9 or so for everything. The carnitas and chicken were decent, but the tortillas were warm and fresh, and the carne asada was out of this world. I usually find carne asada to be a bit tough and under-seasoned, but here it was tender but still chewy and rich with flavor.   We didn't actually do any grocery shopping, but we want to go back at some point soon (maybe at lunchtime) and buy some stuff to take home while sampling some goods from the different specialized stands. Some things that caught my eye to buy or try:  *Pre-seasoned steak fajitas from the butcher *Seafood tacos from the seafood counter *Fresh fruit yogurt from the dairy area *Cuban sandwich from the eatery *Fresh-squeezed carrot juice from the juice stand *Rice pudding from the dessert counter  ...and many more! If you love Mexican food, stop in to the Ranch Market. You'll have your own list soon enough!

I just found something else incredible about Ranch Market, and I'm going to have to up it to 5 stars as a result. Wednesdays are special produce days, which means that tons of different produce items are on special for 3 pounds for $.99. Yes, my friends. $.99.   I had seen the special pricing advertised on the flyers we get every now and then, but had been hesitant to make a special trip there in case the produce was bad-quality or ran out after, say, 10 am. Well, I went today around 1 pm, and I can tell you that the produce is neither bad-quality or gone after 10 am. There were tons of the special advertised items, and 90% looked super-fresh.   I left with 2-3 pounds of bananas, tomatoes, peaches, key limes, and avocados, all of which cost me a mere $5.62. And just think - just yesterday, I spent $2 for 3 tomatoes at Whole Foods. I'll definitely be back at least every other Wednesday to snag some of these special deals.

For anyone who lives in the South Mountain area or South Tempe, this a conveniently-located, family-owned produce stand, bakery, and sandwich shop that features fresh, locally-owned ingredients and really friendly people. My husband stopped there for a sandwich the other day - for only ~$5, he got a turkey sandwich, chips, and a beverage. He said that the meat wasn't great quality, but that the freshly-baked bread was phenomenal. He told me that they had a great selection of dates and figs (my favorite appetizers to make are bacon-wrapped dates and figs with blue cheese, but I always have a hard time finding them, especially figs), so I went back the other day to see their selection for myself.   The woman working greeted me with a smile, asked if I needed help, and offered me a sample of fresh watermelon (it was so juicy and sweet!). I told her I was looking for figs - unfortunately, they didn't have any fresh black ones, but they had some bagged white ones which I haven't been able to find at Fry's or Fresh & Easy. The price was pretty high ($4.50), but I didn't mind, since I knew they would be really fresh and that I would be supporting a family-run business and local growers. Plus, I already had the blue cheese and wanted to make my appetizer!   The only drawback of my experience was the $1.00 transaction fee they charged for paying with debit card. They had a little disclaimer up about being a family-run establishment, and I do understand that the economy's bad, but the fee is really high, even compared to mom-and-pop restaurants in the area. Well, when all was said and done, the figs were delicious, and I am excited to go back and try some more of their produce and baked goods.

First of all, I love this place. I plan to come here regularly as long as I live in Phoenix. Before I go on to expound upon the wonders of my first dining experience here, I need to make a brief but passionate comment about the location of this restaurant. I agree that Poncho's  is a gem, but I think it does a disservice to the residents of this area to think of Poncho's as good *given the area*. Part of what makes restaurants like Poncho's so great is that they are family-run, with the passion and experience of many generations fueling their current success. In my limited time here, South Phoenix strikes me as an area that has a lot of heart and soul to it - a lot of the homes in the neighborhood have been in the family for generations, and certain restaurants here reflect this sense of the past and of community. I loved my first experience at Poncho's because it's such a great dining experience with real ties to the South Phoenix community, not in spite of this fact.   OK, that being said, on to the food and drink! We started with thin, crispy, perfectly salted chips with some hot salsa in a bottle - best starter ever! We ordered margaritas, and our waitress (who was really down-to-earth and helpful) asked if we wanted the "big bowl" ones. "Hmmm, why not," we said (they were priced at $6.50, which is really reasonable). And we didn't regret our choice! They were a little sweet for my taste, but they still had a really great lime flavor and tasted pretty strong. Much better than the limeade Los Dos Molinos tries to pass off as margarita mix! And once we had them along with the chips, the mix started to taste less sweet and became the perfect compliment to the spice of the salsa.   When we first saw the prices of the food, we were shocked! It was so cheap! It's really impressive that the owners have managed to keep the quality and portions so high while keeping prices so low. Based on Yelp reviews, I recommended to my husband that he try the Pollo Fundido (~$7). I tried two a la carte items - the chile relleno w/ chicken (~$5) and the shredded beef enchilada ($3.50). Everything was so rich but so good! The fried shell and the jalapeno cream cheese on the Pollo were so satisfying, the enchilada sauce was really flavorful, and the chicken was moist. The beans and rice were also really good. We enjoyed every minute of our entrees, which we continued to wash down with the margaritas.   We left feeling full but satisfied, and we definitely look forward to coming back soon (perhaps for happy hour or to sit in the cantina, which was really lively). Thank you, Poncho's! I'm glad you exist!

Just like Patrick B, I had bad experiences with Laveen Animal Hospital and needed a new veterinary home for  my cats. Since owning our first cat back in California five years ago, we have not really had great experiences with vets. The pet food scare of several years ago, as well as Californians' growing obsession with pampering their companion animals, probably led to an inflation of vets' prices and a deflation of their genuine concern for the animals.   Dr. Yocham at Southside has been a refreshing change from all of that. His direct, to-the-point, no-BS style is helpful when all we really want is to hear the symptoms, diagnosis and potential solutions. You know, that thing they call medicine? Furthermore, the office is no-frills, with no attempt to "upsell" you with a ton of expensive food and accessories. Finally, the prices are very reasonable which is always nice to see in today's veterinary scene.   Unfortunately, while a few of our encounters at Southside have been run-of-the-mill vet visits, the large majority of our interactions have been related to flife-threatening issues: my little kitty Simon's bout with the fatal disease, FIP, and my other cat Bauer's recent bladder blockage. Adorable Simon didn't make it after six months of fighting the disease, but when we finally put him down at Southside, Dr. Yocham and his staff were appropriately somber and patient with us as we said our good-byes. Recently, with Bauer's unexpected condition, Dr. Yocham thoroughly examined him, told us the problem and gave us three options. While we ended up choosing the most expensive option (a surgery that is supposed to prevent future blockages entirely), we still felt that he presented us with choices and explained why the other two weren't the best for Bauer's long-term health. After his four-day hospitalization and a subsequent suture removal, Bauer is doing great and appears healthier than ever.   Lest I forget the supporting cast, Southside's staff is also very kind and seems genuinely interested in animals. They compliment Dr. Yocham's expert and direct style.   If you're looking for a different kind of vet care, I highly recommend Southside. Do, however, be forewarned that they don't take appointments. That's their only drawback (although, in some cases, when they've been busy but we've had a more serious situation, it's proven a positive thing.)

I've never been a huge fan of bagel sandwiches. I've always preferred just getting a toasted bagel and cream cheese when I frequent a bagel shop. However, the Nosh Bagelry not only has really, really good bagels and cream cheese (with lots of flavors to choose from for both), they also have affordably-priced and delicious bagel sandwiches. My husband and I tried the Nosh Veggie sandwich and the Nosh French Dip. The Veggie was standard but delicious, with veggie cream cheese and a bagel of my choice (I chose onion, naturally), and for only $4.99, I also got potato salad and a pickle. I know the French Dip ($5.99) sounds strange on a bagel, but it was surprisingly really good. The roast beef was decent, and the garlic bagel he chose added a little something special. One delicious touch was that the bagel was buttered; this, along with the au jus, made it rich and flavorful. I will definitely return here for either breakfast or lunch if I'm in the area.

What a sub-par dining experience! I bought my husband a $100 gift card to the Melting Pot for his last birthday; we love fondue and make it frequently at home, but it's always a lot of work, and I thought it would be fun to sit back and let someone else stir the pot, if you will. Well, 2 valuable Friday-night hours and $150 (including the gift card) later, I wished we had stayed at home and created shredded mountains of Gruyere and Fontina ourselves. We selected the "Perfect Night Out" (ha!) menu, which allowed you to choose a cheese fondue, a salad, types of meat, style of broth fondue (for cooking the meat) and a dessert fondue. We both had dirty martinis with Absolut, which were $8.50 - so overpriced. We could have gotten Gray Goose martinis for that price elsewhere.   Anyway, the cheese fondue fixings arrived, and our server (who was really, really nice and pretty much the only good thing about our dining experience) threw them all in the pot, gave them a quick stir, and Voila!, the worst fondue ever was born. It tasted like melted cheddar, and that's it! There was no complexity or richness at all. The bread cubes for dipping were stale, the mixed veggies just contained cauliflower and baby carrots. The Granny Smith apples were decent, but we finished the first course totally unimpressed (and already staring at our watches!). Next up were the salads. They may have been the worst salads we've ever had. The mushroom spinach salad was drenched in jaw-numbingly sweet dressing, and the Caesar salad dressing was sweet too (?!).    At this point, the meat course arrived, and our server mixed up the "Coq Au Vin" broth (this was an $8 upgrade from the regular bouillon broth), dumping an entire carafe of burgundy wine into the fondue pot. After we began eating this course, my husband correctly pointed out that that was wine we could have drunk instead of sending to a flavorless fate in that pot, and I wholeheartedly agree. The meat was either really overseasoned or underseasoned - as an example, the sirloin cubes were coated in stale, dry herbs, but the chicken, which was supposed to have a vanilla essence, tasted just like dr y chicken. To be fair, the shrimp and lobster tail were decent, but I would have rather gone to Red Lobster and had a lifetime supply of shrimp and lobster tail for much less than we paid for this meal. The dipping sauces that came with this course were also confusing - there were like 8 of them, and except for the melted herb butter, they all tasted totally unappealing. The teriyaki glaze and sweet and sour were the worst - they reminded me of sauces that come on a Yoshinoya rice bowl.   Whew, ok, so at this point, we were ready to just get the check and leave before dessert. I am glad that we decided to stick around, since the dessert was the only good part of the meal. We ordered the dark chocolate and Disaronno Amaretto fondue, and we really enjoyed the bananas, rice krispie treats, and strawberries coated with the perfectly melted sauce. The coated marshmellows were strange, though, and we left them on the plate. Based on the taste, quality, and value of this food, I wanted to give this place one star. The incredibly attentive service (don't kill the messenger or, in this case, the deliverer, right?) and dessert made me throw a star back on. If you have $150 to blow, you could have a great meal at Durant's or Elements (or a FEAST at tons of other places); why spend it on an over-hyped and flavorless Melting Pot dinner?

After going to this Joann's location, I don't think I'll ever go to Michael's again! As Amy B said, this is one of the Joann's superstores, which means that it's massive. Not only does it have an enormous selection of fabric, which Michael's does not, it has aisles upon aisles of well-organized items (including but not limited to ribbons, trims, stickers, scrapbook papers, vase fillers, frames, stamps, stencils) for your craft and home decor projects. Also, if you are the crafty type or looking to save money, you can find tons of wedding accessories and project ideas here. This is the kind of place that you could go into without any project ideas, wander around to get inspiration, and leave with an idea *and* the supplies you'll need to execute the vision. As Amy B mentioned, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and checking out was a breeze. I will definitely be back!

Our experience at Thai Basil was sub-par at best. The chicken satay that came with the appetizer sampler was decent, but the rest of the items (fried sweet potato, fried tofu, spring rolls) did not have a crispy enough coating. Perhaps even worse, the coating tasted more like one that belonged on a corn dog than on an Thai morsel.   When we had finished our appetizers, the waiter brought out our spicy clear noodle dish, but not our beef red curry. We decided not to wait to start eating and dove into the noodle dish. It tasted like noodles sauteed in hot sauce and...that's it. In my opinion, good noodle dishes have a complexity - for example, a good pad Thai has hints of tamarine, peanut, lime, and fish sauce. This noodle dish had one level to it, and the one level wasn't even that good.   About 10 minutes later, the waiter returned with our red curry, started to set it down on the table, and then hurriedly excused himself, going back to the kitchen with the dish. 5 minutes later, he returned with the same dish and apologized, saying that before "it was too rare." Well, it was now the opposite of rare - tough and chewy. Additionally, the curry sauce was thin and milky-tasting, not thick and properly balanced between the spice and coconut milk. Oh, and in case it wasn't bad enough already, the rice was chewy and a bit dry as if it had been made the previous day.   So that was our experience at Thai Basil. Not great. Not even good. To be fair, the check was very low for such a decent amount of food, but I would have rather spent $20-$30 more and had a good Thai meal at Wild Thaiger or Malee's Bistro.

My husband and I ended up at Desert Ridge in the middle of a day of physically and emotionally exhausting car shopping. I admit up front that feeling cheated by car salesmen all morning may have made me more likely to squeeze as much enjoyment as possible from Malee's, and that's exactly what happened. Before moving to Phoenix, we had tried the location on Main - we remembered it being good, but a little dark inside. This location was definitely more P.F. Chang's than dimly-lit lounge and at least for lunch, it was nice to sit in a well-lit, comfortably air-conditioned restaurant and enjoy some quality if standard Thai food. The menu certainly had some less-than-authentic options (crab puffs) and was tailored towards people new to or afraid of "ethnic cuisine" (there were indicators on certain parts of the menu like "if you're new to Thai, start here!"). However, the duck curry and jalapeno fried rice we had contained really good quality ingredients (the duck curry was full of tender, large slices of duck breast) and were actually quite flavorful. Next time, we'll say spicy for the curry, though, because medium meant just a hint of spice. To sum it all up, this was a great place to have standard but good Thai-ish food, and if you focus on some of the less fusion-y dishes like the curry, rice, and noodles, you will have a good dining experience.

Swaddee is Thai heaven. Period.   Coming from the Bay Area, I have very high standards for Thai food. In the two months since moving here, I have found some places in the Phoenix area that offer good-quality and flavorful Thai food (Wild Thaiger in downtown, Benjarong in Mesa, Malee's in Desert Ridge and Scottsdale), but I have been waiting to find Thai mecca - a place with incredibly savory and well-balanced food that is served with an authentic level of spiciness. That place is Swaddee. In regards to the price, I am always willing to pay a few dollars more for food that is just that much better than its counterparts, and I would definitely pay more for Swaddee's cuisine than for that at Thai Basil down the road in Ahwatukee, which I found inauthentic and almost inedible.   We started our meal with the papaya salad and tom yum soup. The papaya was crispy and just the right flavor (sweet but not overwhelming), and the dressing was tangy. We asked for it to be '3' level of spiciness (on a scale of '1' to '5') and found that it had a kick without being overwhelming. The soup was unbelievably flavorful with just the right balance between sweet (tamarind) and sour (lime and kaffir). The chicken pieces floating in the broth were really large and tender - no dark meat chunks in this soup!  For our entrees, we had the Pad Thai and Roasted Duck Curry. Many places do their Pad Thai differently with the choice of preparation depending a lot on the region in Thailand that the owners hail from. This particular style of Pad Thai features a thicker sauce which is light on the peanut but heavy on the tamarind and lime flavors (a true "sweet and sour," if you will); it was delicious. We selected '4' as the level of spiciness and found this to add a real kick without obscuring the flavor. As if these first three dishes weren't good enough, the Roasted Duck Curry blew us out of the water. Again, the curry was a thicker consistency than it is at many other Thai places here in Phoenix - almost like a creamy soup. Instead of being that electric red color, it looked like cinnamon. It was absolutely phenomenal - it had a richness of flavor with hints of rarely used spices (like cumin) accented (but not overwhelmed) by the coconut milk. The duck itself was roasted and super-tender and the pineapple was fresh.   All told, our two appetizers, two entrees, and two sodas came out to $45, probably about $15 more than we spent for the same quantity of food at Thai Elephant or Thai Basil, both places we aren't huge fans of, but it was so worth it. This is true Thai food - not watered down or tamed for the masses - that masters the difficult task of balancing sweet and sour, bold and mild. I will be back many, many times.

We were craving food from this place so badly the other night that I drove all the way from South Phoenix to Chandler to pick some up! The food was ready just a few minutes after I got there, and they must have packaged it *really* well (or made it super hot) because it was still hot when I got home 30 minutes later. We didn't try anything new (just the Pad Thai and duck curry, our favorites from last time), but it was just as delicious. The only change I made was ordering our curry "5" (on the 1 to 5 spiciness scale) - it was definitely hot but not as hot as we would get in the Bay Area when we asked for spicy. Can't wait to go back again!

When it comes to book shopping, I'm more of a get-in-and-go type than a browser. I usually go out to buy a book for a specific purpose (e.g., an upcoming trip where I'll have lots of down time), so I appreciate when bookstores lay out books in the front for quick selecting. Borders usually does a really good job of separating out some quick picks by type (new non-fiction, clearance, bestsellers), so it's a good fit for my book shopping style.   I went to this location to pick a book for this upcoming weekend (my husband is taking the AZ bar exam early next week, so I'll have a lot of alone time) and quickly found something that looked interesting on the bestsellers table. The downside of Borders is that the prices are high compared to  buying a book online (my top choice is Amazon.com), but the upside is that it's easier to browse than on Amazon, where I usually find book shopping overwhelming if I don't have a specific book or genre in mind.   The staff at this particular location are friendly and the parking is definitely ample. There is also a Seattle's Best inside this location, a coffee shop I love, but I didn't buy anything from it on my first visit here.

Guess I'm the odd woman out in this string of reviews! My husband and I stayed here on Memorial Day evening to get away for our anniversary, and we both detested almost every aspect of our experience. Thanks a lot, Priceline! We had bid $75 for a "Resort" in the Phoenix area, and at that bid, we probably deserved what we got, but we're still a little bitter :). When we pulled up the driveway to check in, it seemed promising. There were lots of trees and flowers, and everything looked really clean.   The bad part started when we went in to check in. The clerk informed us that they were only "40% full" and therefore had our pick of room locations - any floor, any view, etc. We told him we wanted a first-floor pool view. Easy enough. Then he asked if we "preferred" two queens or a king. Well, since we weren't planning on having any additional overnight guests, we let him know we preferred a king. Well, despite the 40% occupation rate that he had advertised just seconds earlier, he told us that this "upgrade" would carry a $20 fee. We declined and were really annoyed - rather than make a hospitable gesture and offer us a king, which clearly wasn't in high demand - they insisted on charging us. Just a lost opportunity to please the customer! As someone else already mentioned, the resort fee of $16 also seemed useless - it included overnight parking (on a roof-top, unshaded lot), free internet (IF you happened to bring our laptop, which most pleasure travelers wouldn't), 2 bike rentals (we just wanted to go to the pool!), and a "coffee bar" (some carafes of coffee on a table in a dark corridor). Blech.   We went to our room, at least hoping it would be nice. Well, it wasn't. To start with, it was incredible dark, but rather than offering curtains, the first-floor room had dark wood plantation shutters - opening them barely let any light in. One of the floor lamps was also broken. The dark wood trim, accessories, and enormous amoire gave off more of a Spanish monastery vibe than a posh Scottsdale resort. The bathroom was also nothing to write home about - the shower was really small and the curtain looked dingy. To top it all off, we turned on the TV and every channel had a fuzzy picture.   So, you ask, were there any positives? Ok, ok, sitting out by the pool was great (although I attribute that more to the gorgeous Phoenix weather) than the pool (the surface was peeling in a bunch of places, and the walls around the pool were literally covered in moss, which looked to be due to neglect and not a stylistic choice) but the $3.50 well margaritas we had at the pool bar (happy hour 3:30-6:30) were surprisingly good, as were the crab taquitos we ordered as a snack. If you love outdated and overgrown, you'll love this resort. Otherwise, avoid it.

I have a very special place in my heart for hole-in-the-wall bars that serve an eclectic mix of patrons who are brought together by their mutual love for cheap drinks and some good, old-fashioned karaoke. Final Round is one of those places, and I am so glad we decided to give it a try last Friday night after a night of drinking and eating on Mill Avenue (and not just because we were looking for a casual, comfortable, be-yourself kind of place after the flashy scene at Ra!).   I was the designated driver, so I didn't drink anything, but my husband and sister managed to have 3-4 drinks each for only $15 or so (each!). What a deal! They were also offering Red Bull/vodkas for $2, which is pretty much the price of a Red Bull. We sat at a table inside to be closer to the karaoke, but there were two nice large round tables on the outdoor smoking patio, which a lot of people were enjoying. We didn't have food, which I imagine isn't great, although it's a real plus in my mind that if we had wanted to have fries or something to cope with the munchies, we could have.   The bartender herself was nice, but the real highlight for us was how nice and welcoming the guy doing karaoke was. From what we could tell, he works at Final Round and just runs the karaoke on Fridays (as opposed to to the KJs who are paid to come in and bring their own show/equipment). Since he noticed we were new to the place, he took the time to come over and chat with us. It's always nice when someone working somewhere takes the time to make you feel welcome. The sound system itself was surprisingly good, as was the song selection. Because the bar wasn't super-busy, we all got to sing three times in two hours, which is definitely not the case at a lot of karaoke places we've been to.   Because I love karaoke, I have a hard time evaluating bars that offer it from a non-karaoke-lover's perspective. I'll do my best to take a step back, though, and comment on this bar from that point of view - if you like a comfortable dive bar scene where the drinks are cheap and are ok with their not being any sort of hip scene, you will still love Final Round, even if you don't love karaoke. If you also happen to like karaoke, you'll love it even more (just like I do!).

My husband has been craving good NY-style pizza for a while now, and I found Venezia's thanks to Yelp. I went in person to place a to-go order and the place was really busy - it was filled with people sitting down to eat, waiting for to pick-up a phone order, and placing to-go orders. The woman who took my order was still really friendly and patient, despite how busy it was. I ordered a large one-topping pizza ($10.50 with a coupon I found in the paper menu sitting on the counter), a dozen Honey Hot boneless wings ($7.99), and a small salad ($2.99). The wait was 20-25 minutes but the woman was upfront about how long it would be, and the food was definitely worth the wait!  The pizza was really good - tomato sauce that was savory, not sweet, the right amount of real mozzarella, and a crust that was the perfect combination of crunchy and chewy. The wings weren't the best I've ever had, but they used good-quality chicken and had a pretty flavorful sauce. The salad was also pretty good, with fresh lettuce and pepperoncinis. A lot of pizza places skimp on the salad, but this was a decent side salad for ~$3.   Venezia's is a great place to get good-quality NY pizza and sides. They deliver, but I'm not sure how far they'll go. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and give Seamus McCaffrey four solid stars. Given that I don't really like pubs or pub food, I think that four stars is a pretty high rating.   My rating is based on three major things about the place:   1. The outdoor smoking patio with high tables is really nice if you like to smoke when you drink. It's small but certainly serves its purpose. If you don't like being around smoke, you won't agree with this reason. But you have been forewarned and you can feel free to discount my review.   2. The patrons are a really interesting mix of people. When my husband and I went for happy hour, we saw business men in suits and pony-tailed, t-shirt-clad bikers alike enjoying themselves and relaxing after a hard day at work.   3. Maybe I haven't been too enough pubs to know any better, but I really felt like this place had some heart to it--maybe not soul, but certainly heart. When we went for happy hour, I felt like I was hanging out somewhere that had personality (something I can't say about pretty much every other place I've been downtown). While fun, chic, upscale bars have their appeal, sometimes it's nice to just enjoy a beverage in the comfort of a spot that's a bit more real.   Well, folks, these are my reasons. I fully accept that they may not appeal to you, but if anything I've said strikes a cord and you're looking for a chill place to hang out downtown, check Seamus McCaffrey out.

We went to My Florist with four other people we met through Yelp. The idea was to have brunch (it was 11 am on a Sunday), but when we arrived and were seated, we were extremely disappointed to find out that they were no longer serving brunch! It was pretty hard to recover from this blow, but we were hungry and already seated, so we had to force ourselves to abandon dreams of pancakes and eggs and pick something from their lunch menu.   I chose the portobello sandwich ($10.25), and my husband got the roast beef sandwich ($12.50). We both also got Bloody Marys. Both the sandwiches and drinks were disappointing. The portobello sandwich was ok, although the mushroom was a little overcooked and rubbery and the foccacia was a bit greasy. My husband's roast beef sandwich was even worse, though. Not only was the roast beef far from "rare," as the menu promised it would be, but it looked like My Florist had picked up Subway's leftover cold cuts and repackaged them in a sandwich that cost 3 times the price. The cheddar also tasted super standard (think Kraft singles). For $12.50, the sandwich should have tasted a lot more premium that it did.   We did enjoy the light and bright atmosphere inside the cafe and thought it was a good environment for conversation (not too loud, but not quiet and awkward), but were very disappointed with the food. If we actually wake up early enough on a Sunday to make it there before 11, we might give this place another chance for brunch, but since we don't live that close, we probably won't go out of our way to come back.

I've never been much of a gym rat, so take this review with a dose of salt (which, along with sugar, is the only thing that motivates me to work out in the first place). I love food and drink, so exercising has really become my golden ticket to my personal Wonka factory, where I can consume as I please but still stay relatively trim.   And when I first started really working out a few years ago, I quickly realized that the only way for me to be successful was to accept one of my other personal flaws (outside of gluttony): impatience. I can barely go a few minutes at a desk without wanting to do something or talk to someone, so expecting myself to diligently pound a treadmill for an hour at a time is a sure guarantee of failure. That's why I started to do kickboxing at Lee's Martial Arts in Laveen (see my review). The diversity of exercises, the pumping music and motivation of an instructor made it easy to stay engaged for the full hour required to really burn calories and get in shape.   Given that, when we moved to Central Phoenix a few months ago, I wanted to find a new workout home where classes were a priority--and I didn't have to pay a fortune to get that in addition to basic gym privileges. With that as my criteria, the Y has been more than satisfactory. The cost (only $70 per month for two adults) is really reasonable, the instructors are motivating and seem genuinely happy to be teaching, the free weight room has tons of good equipment for any extra toning I want to do, the locker rooms are clean and the staff is all friendly and helpful. Plus, I can continue to do kickboxing with Marco (great instructor) every Monday and Wednesday at 5:30. I also really like that the facility is housed in an old building. In a city of strip malls and new construction, God knows we could use a little character.   Of course, the Y has downsides (bad parking as others have mentioned, awkward layout, less-than-high-end showering facilities and sub-par food choices), but it's well worth the money, and my waistline, wallet and attention span are all the better since joining.

I totally agree with Stevey  P - the best thing about Heritage Square is that it preserves the past while still celebrating modern culture. Yes, you can see beautifully-restored Victorian homes and imagine how things used to be, but you can also have some of the country's best pizza at Pizzeria Bianco, down a pint at Rose & Crown, or take part in celebrations of different cultures and social groups. We walked around here for the first time this past Friday, when it was deathly hot out, but I look forward to cooler weather, when my husband and I can come here and sit one of of the gorgeous, shaded benches and just take in the scene.

The fact that Networks had four stars a few days ago and now only averages three demonstrates the potential impact of not treating your customers well, especially when six out of eight of them just happen to be Yelpers who are not afraid to write about their bad experience.   I was part of the group of 8 that stopped by Networks during last Saturday's pub crawl (which was featuring drink specials and food samples from downtown businesses). This event was clearly planned in order to generate more business for these local spots, which makes the manager's refusal to give us $1 beer and wine or any sort of meaningful concession (when the downtown pub crawl materials said "$1 beer, $1 signature wines" with no "off" anywhere in sight) that much worse.   You are certainly free to check this place out for yourself and maybe these four one-star reviews won't do anything to change Networks' core crowd of patrons, but I can guarantee you that Networks lost the approval (and referral) of five very grumpy Yelpers!  P.S. Congealed, cold pizza cut into miniature slices doesn't count as a "food sample."

Echoing Tracy, this place is truly a wonderful animal shelter. While of course recognizing the differences in fundraising and available resources in the animal shelter world, Campus for Compassion should still be recognized as a clean and hospitable place for homeless pets where the staff is super-friendly and genuinely cares. In other words, while some shelters, especially city or county-run ones, can't necessarily be blamed for the poor conditions their animals are housed in, it is still refreshing to see a non-profit organization that's making every effort to provide a shelter that's on a whole other level. This place is literally a few blocks from our house, and since the moment we moved in, we have literally been there two times a week to check out all of the new kittens (it's full-on kitten season right now!). Last Friday afternoon, we finally succumbed and adopted two beautiful little tabby brothers. (We already have two cats, so we knew that we were in for a crazy month or two!). The adoption counselors were patient and kind and treated us with respect both when we played with the kittens in the "get acquainted" rooms and when we sat down to fill out our paperwork. Do be forewarned that they take a long time to fill out all of the adoption paperwork and get the process finalized, so don't expect to just be in and out. If you want to adopt a homeless pet from a great organization run by great people, definitely stop by here! As a side note, they also have a little pet shop with food, supplies, and toys - because it's a nonprofit, everything is tax-free and the proceeds go back to the Humane Society.

Just wanted to add that the Humane Society's partnership with VCA Animal Hospitals (offering up to $500 per pet of free post-adoption care for certain standard infections and medications) was amazing. Do note that there are time restrictions (I think the offer is up 2 weeks after adoption). We ended up going to VCA Elliot Park in Tempe (see my separate review for them) for our two new kittens and having two visits each, as well as antibiotics, completely covered. This was such a big help, as the costs right after adoption are often the greatest (because of shelter conditions, etc). I hope it incentivizes a lot of people to adopt who otherwise couldn't afford it. More good homes for all of the adorable kittens we see every time we go!

My husband and I tried this place for lunch the other day and were really impressed. The portions were humongous, and the prices were very reasonable given the portion size (and quality!). You know, sort of like Applebee's current "right portion, right price" promotion, except that at Vaqueros, the portions make you feel like you're getting a lot of real value for your money. The decor is no-frills, but the woman working at the register was super-friendly, and the free salsa bar with pickled carrots and chips was a great way to start our lunch.   I had the carnitas (~$7.50) and my husband had the burro/enchilada combo plate ($6.50). The carnitas weren't as savory as the ones I've had elsewhere (Los Dos Molinos is a good example), but they were seasoned well and came with some of the best rice and beans I've ever had. My husband's seasoned beef (in the burro) was also not intensely fllavorful but was still decent. His enchilada was a real standout; the sauce had just the right amount of chile flavor and spice and the cheese was perfectly gooey - not soggy, not congealed. We wished we had forgone things with meat and just ordered 6 cheese enchiladas as our meal! Overall, though, we were definitely impressed with the food and would definitely return.   Just as an FYI - they do take credit cards but charge a transaction fee ($.50) so you might want to just bring cash. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention - they have a drive-thru!

Part of the reason I wanted to get a tattoo in the first place is that I am such a planner to a fault that I wanted to put myself through an experience that I wouldn't be able to completely control every aspect of. That being said, once I had made the decision, I researched my potential tattoo shop and artist very carefully. After all, I only wanted to lose a bit of control once I actually knew I was in the capable hands of a professional!   I started here on Yelp, noticing right away that there weren't that many tattoo shops even reviewed. Urban Art stood out to me, not only because it had a high star rating, but because everyone who had actually gotten a tattoo there (as opposed to a piercing) gave it five stars. That didn't seem to be true of the other places I read about. To be fair, No Regrets Tattoo had a pretty high star rating, but I don't know, the name freaked me out a bit! (I'm sure that's not the effect they wanted to have!).   Anyway, my decision to go to Urban Art for my first tattoo was cemented when I was at Habit Salon in Mesa getting my hair done (great experience, review to come!) and noticed that the stylist next to my station had a gorgeous sleeve tattoo with lots of great color and beautiful flowers. I asked her where she had gone and she said that she had gone to Justin at Urban Art. You can't beat being able to see someone's amazing work in person, so I was totally sold!  I called a few days later to make an appointment and was blown away by how nice and professional the person I spoke with was. (After going there, I learned that her name was Samantha.) From my past piercing experiences, I guess I just expected some attitude. I told her that I wanted to make an appointment with Justin and asked what the next steps were. She told me that I needed to come in for a consultation, but once I told her that I lived pretty far (on the Phoenix/Laveen border), she said it was OK if I emailed Justin directly to give him the details and schedule a time. I'm sure it's standard practice to go in and discuss the design, but I'm glad they gave me the opportunity to schedule based on my own constraints.   I emailed Justin that night with some specific ideas of what I wanted to incorporate into the design and he responded very quickly thanking me for my email and confirming my appointment (for mid-September). He told me that I would see the design when I got there. He also quoted me a price, which seemed very reasonable, and the estimated time he thought it would take.   The day of my appointment (after 48 hours of a dry spell since you're not supposed to drink anything so I didn't. Like I said, I'm a planner), I arrived with my husband nervous as all hell. Everyone who worked there was so friendly and professional, which definitely put me at ease, although I got really antsy sitting in the "living room" area watching people come in and out to get piercings. ("Lucky bastards only have to have a second of two of pain," I thought as I waited). Justin greeted me soon after I got there and showed me the sketch of the design he had come up with. I was so impressed by how he took my words and translated them into pictures.   The actual tattooing experience was, in some ways, more painful than I thought it would be, but Justin handled the experience in a professional--almost clinical--way. I kind of escaped into a zone where I just fought through the pain to be proud of what I was putting myself through, and he respected that, not trying to chat me up or force me to act a different way than I felt in the moment. I guess in the end being serious about it allows the artist to be serious as well, so don't go drunk and stupid to get art done on yourself and expect it to turn out like a masterpiece. Anyway, when all was said and done (after about an hour and 15 minutes), I got bandaged and then went up to pay. I left feeling on top of the world (those endorphins are crazy!).   The funny thing about tattoos is that you almost can't completely judge the professionalism and expertise of the artist until you're done and a few weeks out, when you can see how well the tattoo heals and how great the design looks on my healed skin (and with clothes). In my case, the tattoo healed incredibly, which I contribute partially to my own (typical) attentiveness to the "process," but also to his steady hand and expertise. I've gotten many compliments on the design as well, which you can see in the picture that I uploaded.   I'm already thinking of my next tattoo (which everyone who has gotten one says you will!) and I am 110% confident that I will go back to Justin at Urban Art. As I said though, you won't be able to really understand until you do it yourself--so what are you waiting for?

Since my first experience at Urban Art, I have definitely turned into a loyal customer, getting my next three tattoos (yes, I've had three more since the first one!) at this same location. However, for the last two, I've gone to Neil. (I think Justin was booked the first time around and I decided to try someone else at the shop. The second time around, I chose to work with Neil and my husband actually got his first tattoo from Justin.)   I am definitely more than happy with Neil's work. He and Justin are friends with some common artistic leanings but distinct styles at the same time, so it's cool to have tattoos from both of them. I definitely appreciated both of their willingness to talk through my tattoo ideas and make recommendations inspired by but elevating my vision.   On another positive note, Neil is a really fun and interesting person, which makes the tattooing go by relatively quickly. (Yes, it still hurts, but with the right breathing and good conversation, it's survivable!). With my last tattoo (a back piece that took around 12 hours in multiple sessions), that personality was definitely a huge plus!   If you are looking for a great tattoo from a professional yet outgoing artist, I highly recommend Neil!

I'm among the many Yelpers that went to the Comedy Spot last Sunday to check out the esteemed Thomas S. do his thing during the Amateur/Open Mic Night. He definitely did us proud, and some of the other comics were quite funny, too. Maybe the fact that we only paid $10 each made my comic expectations a little lower, but I thought that the vast majority of comics were funny and had creative and well-timed routines. Do note that we purchased our tickets ahead of time through their website, which is probably a good move since the place is so small.   I, too, liked the intimate and laid-back vibe of the venue. The staff was really cool, and the ones who performed were comic naturals. I, do, have a few gripes, though. I also loved the cozy seating that allowed us to be up close and personal with the many characters in the audience (cougars in pink, Madonna look-a-like, and loud, attention-seeking redhead, anyone?), but being on the end of the curved booth seating, I was craning my neck the entire time to see the stage. I also thought the drinks were pretty weak (albeit relatively cheap for a place with a minimum), and the soda water was flat. On the upside, the cocktail waitress was efficient and we didn't wait long for the drinks to arrive.   Oh, I almost forgot to mention. When I went to the bathroom (which is always an awkward move if the comic performing likes to make canned statements like "Well, of course HE has to go TAKE A CRAP right when I start performing"), I discovered this whole back corridor area with a separate bar. It was forest-themed or something and kind of reminded me of some Disneyland ride (like the Pirates of the Caribbean or Splash Mountain). I don't know what they usually use it for, but this particular night, they had the comics stashed back there until their turn came. Strange stuff.   Anyway, the Comedy Spot was a good place to get some solid entertainment for not that much cash, and I liked the unpretentious vibe. We'll probably check it out again at some point.

My husband and I were really excited to try Cowboy Ciao after all the rave reviews we'd seen on Yelp and were definitely not disappointed - at least not by the food and drinks. The fact that we were less than impressed with the atmosphere (really dark, decor kind of reminded me of Black Angus) and staff (our server was overly enthusiastic when presenting the specials but not around when you needed more water or the check) isn't enough to make me take away a star or two because the food and drinks were delicious and well-prepared enough to make the experience a great one despite these drawbacks.   I got the Movie Star Martini, and my husband got some version of the Manhattan (can't remember the name) - both drinks tasted like well-thought-out concoctions and were definitely worth the $10-$12 (which is something I cannot say for many over-priced restaurant cocktails). We started with the oh-so-famous Chopped and it was heavenly. We actually didn't like the Buffalo Carpaccio as much as we hoped we would - while the meat itself was tender and fresh, the chef had overseasoned it and the espresso and cumin flavors were overpowering.   For our entrees, we had the pork chop stuffed with blue cheese and bread pudding and the short ribs with cherry bbq sauce. We were both impressed that the server asked if we were ok with having the pork slightly undercooked -this preparation is really the most flavorful, but many people remain uncomfortable with undercooked pork because of the trichinosis incidents of many years ago. Having it prepared this way made it so tender, and the meat's flavor was complemented by the bread pudding, figs/raisins, and flavorful sauce that accompanied it. The beef short ribs were also deliciously tender and came with a hearty but so rich serving of pecan grits. My favorite part was definitely the tangy barbecue sauce with whole cherries in it.   Overall, this was a great (although expensive!) meal, and I am sure that we will return to Cowboy Ciao (maybe with guests from out of town) although the slightly-pretentious decor, service, and concept will probably prevent us from making this a more frequent destination.

The thing about reviews on a 1-to-5-star scale is that you can't be as precise as you want to be or call out specific aspects of the restaurant experience (service, food, ambience, clientele, etc.) that are truly deserving of a higher or lower rating. All you can really do is go on an overall impression that is made higher or lower depending on which of these factors matter more or less to you personally. Me - I'm all about the food and drink. Things like excellent service or a great setting can push me up that extra notch, but they won't be determinative unless they're truly specactular. Elements was a dining experience that had some of these truly spectacular qualities and therefore made my rating much higher than it would have been if I were just considering the food and drink.   My husband and I went on Memorial Day for our two-year wedding anniversary; we had reserved in advance using OpenTable.com and I put that it was our anniversary and requested a "table with a view" in the special requests section. This worked out quite well, since we were immediately seated at a "lower booth" down by the huge picture windows even though we arrived 15 minutes early. The booth was super-private and had the most unobstructed view in the restaurant. Our server was very professional and attentive - he made sure to space our courses out, to not open our bottle of prosecco until we had finished our cocktails, and to refill water and check in often but not too often. The drinks were quite expensive - we both got a signature cocktail at $15 - but fairly unique. Mine featured a snap-pea vodka (interesting!), and my husband got something with some special gin. They were definitely enjoyable, although not blow-your-mind in a $15-a-pop kind of way. The prosecco was also decent and the only really reasonably-priced item we had at $28 for a bottle.   We started the meal with the Tuna Tartare and the spanish-inspired quail with chorizo. The Tuna Tartare was good but nothing spectular - the fish was certainly fresh, but none of the flavors of the avocado or cucumber mound it topped stood out or really complemented the fish and at $20 for the plate, I could have gotten two plates of the same dish for the same price at a different restaurant. For my entree, I had the special, which was black cod on top of potato cake with a single clam on top. It was priced around $35. My husband had the niraigi (sp?), which is actually striped marlin, which came with a cucumber salad and jasmine rice. It was also around $35. Both fishes were fresh, and the sides were flavorful enough, but neither dish stood out or was particularly outstanding.   That being said, however, being there in a private booth with the most beautiful desert view in the city, we truly felt that we would have been hard-pressed to celebrate our special occasion in a more special way - even if the food were better. The view and service were just that good. If you want romance and a great dining experience on a special occasion, go to Elements. If you want to simply check out the resort (Sanctuary) and see the view but not spend a ton of money, go to Jade Bar (attached to the restaurant but in a separate room).

The day after a fun and crazy house party, my husband and I discovered that the lens on our Canon PowerShot was slightly dented and wouldn't go back into the camera body. Because it recognized a "lens error," the camera also wouldn't take pictures. I called Canon's support line but they insisted that I send the camera in for a free diagnosis. I was suspicious that the issue wouldn't be covered under warranty and we would end up having to pay a lot to have them repair it. So, based on a recommendation from a Yelp talk thread (thanks, Chris T!), I decided to check out Tempe Camera.   When I walked in the main entrance, I quickly saw the repair desk on the right (it was clearly marked and easy to spot). There was no line, so the woman working behind the counter called me right up. She patiently listened as I explained the problem. She did say that the lens issue would not be covered under Canon's warranty and that Tempe Camera would cost me ~$175 to repair ($100 for part; $75 for repair). I truly appreciated how up front she was about the cost and the fact that she didn't try to convince me to pay for repairs when replacement would probably cost the same or less. This honesty made the business come across as very reputable and trustworthy.   I doubt I will be back to Tempe Camera since my photography efforts are limited to taking digital pictures of my cats and posting them on Facebook and it seems that it costs more to fix digital cameras than to replace them. However, I appreciated Tempe Camera's integrity and would recommend them to anyone who takes photography seriously and has a really nice camera that needs repairs.

Kristin S has always raved about this place as being an amazing happy hour spot, so my husband and I met her, as well as Melissa H and her husband, there for some discounted appetizers and drinks. Since Kristin had mentioned that the bar fills up really quickly during happy hour (which happens everyday from 4 - 7 pm), those of us who could arrive around 4:30 did. It didn't end up being that crowded after all, but given that the only bar-area seating consists of seats at the smallish bar and a few high tables, I would still recommend arriving as early as you can so that you don't end up missing the great happy hour deals.   All of us ended up finding a drink deal that fit our mood at the moment: Melissa and her husband got some draft beer for only $2, Kristin took advantage of the wine specials (50% of wine by the glass), and my husband and I each sampled two signature cocktails that were discounted from $12 to $8. The Prosciutto e Melone and XXX martinis were good but not spectacular, but we both thought that the Anastasia (vodka, basil, and muddled strawberries) and the Blueberry Lemon Drop (with fresh blueberries) were distinctive and delicious. Next time, we'll probably have wine and beer, though, so we can really experience how cheap Caffe Boa's happy hour can be!  In terms of food, the following appetizers are 50% off during happy hour: bruschetta, antipasto platter, Shrimp Adriatico, and Capriatta (essentially a Caprese salad). Since all of these appetizers (except for the antipasto platter, which is normally $15) are usually $6 - $10, you can truly eat well for cheap! We tried all of these four apps except for the Capriatta. I especially enjoyed the Shrimp Adriatico's spicy and savory tomato-based sauce (excellent to dip bread in!) and the antipasto platter was presented well and featured some high-quality meats, cheeses, and vegetables.   As everyone has already said, Caffe Boa's happy hour offers discounted and good drinks and appetizers in an non-Mill Avenue environment. I doubt I'll return for dinner, but I will definitely stop by the bar area between 4 and 7 at some point soon!

Tott's is not a place you would go out of your way to frequent if you didn't like or work in the area. If you do, however, live or work in the area, I would highly recommend checking it for a fast and decent Asian lunch or dinner. And, yes, I use the word Asian, not Chinese - even though the dishes on the menu are primarily Chinese (although even that word is used loosely), the owners' inclusion of select Thai and Japanese dishes makes the cuisine more Asian than Chinese. Sort of like the food at Pei Wei, which just happens to be in the same center, but cheaper, more flavorful, and served with a little more heart.   I was in the area picking up some medicine at our vet, so I thought I'd stop in and try one of Tott's lunch specials. Parking was a little tight in that particular part of the center, but I lucked out and found a decent spot that someone was pulling out of. When I went inside, I was impressed by the clean and simple decor - the red/black loft-like ceiling and tile backsplash behind the register were especially nice touches.   I was also impressed by how amicable and helpful the GM was. When I placed my order (the $5.99 lunch special of Spicy Szechuan with tofu and brown rice) and asked how spicy it would be on a scale of 1 to 5 (since the signature chili symbol on a Chinese menu doesn't usually mean much), he took the time to explain that it was prepared medium-spicy and that if I really wanted to experience the full savoriness of the dish, I would probably enjoy having it spicy. He even added in a comment about how he approved of my choice since "spicy is good for the body"! Even though he was super-busy during the "lunch rush," I definitely appreciated his willingness to assist me in making my food the way I like it.   I sat down and put my number card on the edge of the table, but I didn't have to wait long for my food. The GM came over with it just 3 or 4 minutes later. The portions of the tofu/veggies and rice were quite substantial, and I could see that the veggies were fresh by how crisp and colorful they were. I was also impressed by the flavor of the dish; while the sauce was definitely your run-of-the-mill Americanized brown gravy, the spiciness was definitely there and the tofu and veggies were cooked really well. When I was done eating, I felt satisfied but not too heavy.   Tott's is a clean, friendly, and flavorful alternative to other fast-food Chinese joints or to Chinese restaurants offering lunch specials. I will definitely be back if I'm in the area again.

I love cake donuts so much, so I'm really glad I don't attend more gatherings like church services or potlucks where donuts are often served because I would be in serious trouble. Since I stay away from these types of events and therefore from temptation, I'm fortunate enough to only have a truly serious craving (the kind that will actually drive me to go online and look up the closest donut place) every so often.   The other day, after hearing about Dunkin Donuts' recent re-opening, I got one of these cravings - a serious, insatiable longing for a cakey, moist, buttery donut. Thanks to Yelp (and Eric P's review), I found this little shop right at the intersection of Central and Southern (right near the South Phoenix Ranch Market location).   My husband and I went in around 3 pm and got two cake donuts to try (one chocolate and one cinnamon crumble). They were only $.75 each, and they were absolutely perfect. The texture and flavor were exactly how they should have been, and we were especially impressed by how fresh (and not stale) they tasted for the time of day it was. Only problem now is to figure out how to not make this place (which is basically on the way from our house to anything we go to in downtown or Central Phoenix) a regular stop!

I had high hopes for Lux partly because of my desire for independent and unique businesses to succeed but also because I'm an Italophile who loves real espresso and secretly wishes she could wake up every morning in Rome, walk down to the neighborhood bar, and grab a cornetto (Italian version of croissant) and a rich, deep espresso. Since I obviously can't do that, I am always hoping that I can find a place locally that can re-create that nonchalant but cultured atmosphere so prevalent in European establishments and, of course, make some damn good espresso.   Lux definitely gets some points for approximating the refined but casual feel of cafes and coffee shops in places like New York and Paris, and I very much appreciate places that remind us that eating and drinking are just as much an experience as they are about refueling quickly before we go off to our next daily task. However, because "la dolce vita" is not just about atmosphere but is also about taste and quality, I have to express my disappointment in the espresso we were served. It just wasn't that good. It was quite bitter, in fact, and it left a bit of a bad aftertaste in my mouth. I kind of expected more from the hype (and from the fact that I paid $2.50 for it).   To be fair to Lux, I've been back since and the espresso and americanos were much better on my subsequent visits. In any event, it's always nice to take a break from the frenzied pace of life and to avoid the Starbucks drive-thrus as much as possible.

After months of avoiding Los Dos Molinos in favor of places with better service and margaritas, we decided to return last Saturday night and give the place another chance. We were actually even less impressed with the experience than last time.   My blue corn enchiladas were still quite good, but my husband's chimichanga was just average. I guarantee you that you can get a better chimichanga for half the price at many of the other great Mexican restaurants in South Phoenix. The accompanying rice was also really dry; I think the rice at Poncho's is a lot better.   I also gave the tequila-flavored limeade--I mean, margaritas--another chance, but was still completely disgusted by them. The most amusing part is that after I told the server that I found them to be too limey and sweet last time, he admitted that they mix the margaritas up in advance and that if the server doesn't properly "stir" the mix, they can be "too sweet." He then promised me that it would be "better this time." I guess I'm a sucker for ordering one anyway (I guess I had this morbid desire to see if it was really going to be as bad as last time), but shame on Los Dos Molinos for approaching margarita-making like they're serving drinks at a college party.   Finally, the service is totally pretentious for no reason. I understand that this restaurant is very popular, but I don't feel that the owners take much pride in putting out consistently good-quality food and drinks or in being a place where people feel comfortable and want to linger with friends.   Los Dos Molinos must always be so busy because people are lured by the exotic spiciness (and maybe falsely equate spiciness with authenticity), but I have a feeling that discerning restaurant-goers who notice (and care about) the details might not be in love with the place.

Imperial Palace is not just outdated because it's old, dingy, and still has popcorn ceilings in the guest rooms. It's outdated because it has this non-specific, non-unique, pan-Asian decor that originated long before the now-common concept of Asian fusion. In fact, Imperial Palace was re-themed in 1979, when using the term "Oriental" was still acceptable. I'm pretty sure nothing has changed since then, even though Asian decor now conjures up bamboo, rich greens and browns, and soft fabrics far more than it does pagodas, blocky script font, or a blue and white color scheme.   My husband and I have been inside Imperial Palace many times before to gamble, check out the celebrity impersonators/dealers (gotta love that Charro wannabe calling out roulette numbers!), and sing at the karaoke lounge (which used to be located downstairs in the little detached space in front of the main entrance and is now inside the main hotel). However, we had never stayed there, choosing instead to spend a bit extra (or on a good weekend, significantly less!) for a hotel that was a lot nicer (our favorites include Aladdin/Planet Hollywood, Bally's, and Mandalay Bay). This particular weekend, however, was Veteran's Day and also happened to be the weekend Madonna was in town for a show and the weekend of a massive bull-riding convention (always forget these kind of things exist!).   Anyway, hotels were a lot more expensive than we were used to paying in Vegas and we were only planning to be in town for the night, so we ended up choosing the Imperial Palace. I knew from the pictures on the web site that the rooms were going to be hideous, but I could never have anticipated just how dingy and unappealing they were. The walls had a yellowish tint, the furniture was peeling, and the concrete on the patio was almost black from various, un-identified stains. We were also weirded out by the sign on the patio door that said "This door may self-lock from the outside." What a relief that we weren't planning to spend a second out there anyway!   I agree that Imperial Palace is in a great location. I also know that most people (like my husband and I) will not spend much time in their hotel room while in Vegas. I also still think that IP is a true, character-filled kind of spot to gamble while you are out and about. However, unless you plan to be with friends (and not with a SO or spouse that you may actually want to be close to) and are truly not snobby about your accommodations (be honest with yourself, people!), you may want to spend a bit extra and actually stay elsewhere. If you do decide to take the plunge, bring some Febreeze and check your diva self at the door!

I rarely give a place four stars if I don't plan to return there. SW Steakhouse will be an exception to that rule. Although my husband and I aren't huge steakhouse people, which is especially true when we go to Vegas and want to try something really different or exotic, and therefore probably won't go back to SW Steakhouse, we enjoyed our experience there this past visit and thought that the service and food were really good.   We went with the group of 7 that Kristin S and Melissa H were also part of. I agree with Kristin that the restaurant's atmosphere is really nice--upscale without being over-the-top (a balance that is hard to strike in Vegas, I think). The bathrooms (located behind the bar) were also really sleek. I also agree with both of them that the service was attentive and professional. My meal flowed very nicely, and we were never short of refills on our water or alcoholic beverages.   Speaking of drinks, my husband and I really enjoyed our dirty vodka martinis and thought they were really well-mixed. I also thought that my friend's ginger pear martini was really smooth and had great fruit flavor without being saccharin. I can't comment on the wine or beer selection since I didn't have (or think about having) either.   In terms of food, we started off with a dozen oysters. Admittedly, I have not had the privilege or pleasure of tasting the best oysters our nation has to offer (part of the sacrifice you make by living in California and then Arizona), but I have still had many oysters in my time and thought that these were among the best. Many other upscale restaurants and bars in Vegas serve oysters, but they don't seem as committed as SW obviously did to serving the freshest and most flavorful.   For entrees, I shared the scallops and ahi tuna with my friend. We found the scallops to be really well cooked (not grainy or overly tough) and super fresh (no metallic taste at all) and the accompanying pea/parmesan risotto to be hearty yet delicate, but the ahi tuna was very disappointing. It was overcooked and had a very bland taste to it; we definitely didn't taste the Meyer lemon that was supposed to be the dish's signature flavor. This alone is worth docking SW a star over, since I think ahi tuna is a dish that every restaurant worth the salt should be able to produce a good (even if standard) version of.   I also tried a bite of my friend's steak and found it be very tender and flavorful, but I'm no steak connoisseur, so if you are deciding whether the steak at SW will pass the cut (no pun intended), I would read a few other reviews. The final thing I tried was my husband's goat cheese ravioli (ordered off of the appetizer section of the menu)--while the dish was un-original, the filling was rich and the ravioli perfectly al dente. Definitely a solidly flavorful dish.   Overall, SW definitely delivered, although upon returning to Vegas (which will be soon, I'm sure), I'll probably take the $80 per person my husband and I spent at SW and spend it somewhere with a bit more focus on culinary innovation and creative execution.

Went back to FEZ last night for a couple of appetizers and martinis and had an excellent time! I really enjoyed the calmer Tuesday evening scene (we went during Friday happy hour last time) and loved sitting at a table (which I usually feel guilty doing if I'm not having a full meal). Our server was really attentive and friendly, and I finally got to meet Thomas S., who was really cool and so much fun to chat with!   I think that FEZ's specialty martinis are delicious - a lot better than the margaritas we had last time. I had the Orange Marmalade martini (which was only $5 because it was Svedka Tuesday, meaning that all specialty martinis with Svedka vodka were only $5), and it was deliciously citrusy without being overly sweet. My husband got the Svedka martini "lightly dirty," and it was also perfectly mixed- whoever made the drink understood his desired level of dirtiness (mind out of gutter, please!). The lettuce wraps were as good as everyone raves about, and the lettuce spears it came with were the perfect size and texture (I hate when the lettuce pieces provided with wraps are too small or flimsy to hold the contents). The spicy harissa fries were also really good - the spicy powder was really flavorful, and the fries themselves fit our definition of perfect fries (not too thick, not too thin, not too soggy, not too crispy!).   I think that FEZ really shines in the specialty martini department, and most of the food we've tried there has been great. I do think that if you're looking for a quiet spot to share some drinks/appetizers and chat, you'll probably want to go later on a weekday and not during happy hour. That being said, if you want a happening place (and 2-4-1 margaritas), check them out during happy hour!

I first tried Mamma Mia's at the Yelp Birthday Party event (at the Phoenix Art Museum). I honestly wasn't super impressed by the pasta (I believe it was a penne vodka)--I found it a bit soggy and the sauce a bit too creamy for my taste. However, I remember thinking that the pizza was really simple but good NY-style pizza with slightly crispy thin crust, sauce that's not too zesty or sweet, and just the right amount of good-quality cheese.   The employees manning the table at the event that night were also super friendly and even offered me a free pizza token when they found out they delivered to my office (located just a few blocks away).   Since then, I've had Mamma Mia's pizza twice: once when a few co-workers and I cashed in the token and got a cheese pizza delivered to the office and again recently when a co-worker and I stopped in for the $3.50 lunch special (two slices and a soda). Both times, the pizza lived up to the stuff I tried at the museum event. I was also really impressed with the quick delivery (and friendly delivery man).   I'm sure I will be back to this Mamma Mia's location many times (or at the very least, I will be calling them for delivery to my office!).

Definitely agree with other reviewers that Parasol is a perfect spot for what I'd like to call a "transitional moment"--you know, a time when you find yourself wanting a spot to sit back and enjoy an alcoholic beverage but ultimately have other destinations you want to end up. I definitely can't see myself spending more than an hour or two at this lounge, but it (specifically, the Parasol Down portion) was the perfect place to unwind after dinner at SW and keep the buzz going until the next planned stop (Blush).   Our cocktail server was really friendly and brought our drinks really quickly. Considering we were in the Wynn, the drinks weren't too overpriced. I believe it was about $80 or so for a round (plus a second for a few people). The seating situation was a little less than ideal for a group of 7; we had to pull up chairs from a bunch of other table and the table was a little too small to comfortably fit everyone's drinks. I also wasn't thrilled with the light level -- if it were a little earlier in the night, I'd be ok with the whole lounge being so brightly lit, but I think they could turn the lights down a notch and give the place a bit more atmosphere.   Those small complaints aside, I was happy with the time we spent at Parasol. I definitely nominate it for the "Best Place to Stop on Your Way Somewhere Else" award!

The Grand Avenue Tavern is on the corner of Grand Avenue and 24th Avenue, an intersection in an area that is dotted with industrial warehouses, auto repair shops, and strip clubs. This particular building is right up against a very seedy looking motel that advertises singles starting at just $29.95. (What a steal!) As other reviewers have already said, you would definitely not expect to find a sleek, clean, and modern bar in this spot. But in many ways this place's unexpected style is part of its charm.   When we walked in, we found ourselves in a really dimly lit room that looked like just another dive bar, and we wondered whether all the Yelpers who raved about how classy these place was despite the locale had been talking about a different place! However, once we sat down at the U-shaped bar and our eyes adjusted, we observed all the details that really make this place stand out from the crowd - beautiful glass storage for liquor bottles, a sleek mahogany tone to the bar counter, sleek flat-screen TVs that were built into the bar cabinetry, and plentiful seating. The bartender who took our drink order was efficient and friendly, and the drinks (only $4 during happy hour) were nice and strong. The only downside was the DJ was playing the music so loudly that we couldn't hear each other talk, so we decided to check out the outside patio.   We were so glad we did because the patio was even nicer than the inside of the bar. The ground was covered in Mediterranean pavers, and there were plenty of nice-looking and comfortable outdoor furniture sets. There was also a canopy over the space, as well as misters, to keep things cool. We sat on a L-shaped couch in the corner and enjoyed the rest of our drinks. Because the furniture was oriented to allow for individual groups/couples to carve out separate areas within the space, we were able to talk and hear each other, while still enjoying the bar ambience. I really appreciate the fact that the bar owner took the time to create such a nice outdoor space and therefore provide an alternative to the noisy bar area.   I noticed on the bar's website that they have karaoke on Wednesday nights, so we will have to go back to check that out. Since we live on the Phoenix/Laveen border, this location is convenient for us and may just become a regular spot.

I've been to Padre's twice now - once for a full dinner and a second time for a margarita and a bite. I really like the bar area, find the service to be friendly and attentive, and think that certain dishes on the are top-notch. On the downside, the dining area (as opposed to the bar) is dull, the parking is tight, and the margaritas aren't all they're cracked up to be.   Both times we've gone, we've really loved the food. The cilantro mousse was a really interesting and different accompaniment to chips, and the black bean soup was a flavorful and rich starter. As far as main dishes,  the duck tacos are absolutely outstanding. Wow. We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside. I'm not a huge steak person, and I love the way their duck combines the juiciness and charred texture of steak with the lightness of poultry. Both times, we also had super-friendly servers who were very attentive.   We did not fall head-over-heels for the margaritas, though. We tried the $5 Padre's Margarita and found it to be way too sweet. Not the worst margarita we've had, but nothing outstanding either; I much prefer the house margaritas at Z Tejas if I'm going to go cheap, or the fresh-squeezed/hand-mixed ones at McCormick's if I feel like splurging.   We also weren't huge fans of the dining area. The first time, we chose to sat there, whereas the second time we were offered a table since the bar area was full. It's just kind of closed off and uninspiring, with ugly gold ceiling fans and no windows. Atmosphere isn't everything, but it would be nice for the dining area to complement or highlight the inventiveness and passion that clearly goes into the food.   A few final notes:   1. Parking is tight, and even if you're lucky enough to find a spot in front, good luck getting out of it. I had to do a three-point turn just to pull out of the angled spot!  2. There appears to be a big patio on the left side of the building. I'm not sure if food is served there, but it looked like a really pretty spot to have a drink and talk. 3. Happy hour is M-F from 4-6 pm in the bar area only. Beer is $2.50, margaritas are $3, mojo martinis and wine of the day are $5, and mojitos are $6. There is a special 6-item bar food menu with prices ranging from $5 to $7.

I'm not normally one to let a business' really cool atmosphere or architecture influence my impression of the place more than its food or drinks (would I like the donuts at one of those stands with a huge donut shape on top more than any other donuts?), but I might have to make an exception for Copper Star. We stopped by earlier this week for Yelp office hours (thanks again, Gabi, for organizing) and got an iced latte. It was good, but what really impressed me about this place is that it's in an old converted gas station! I just think that is so fun and cool, and it adds so much to the place's charm. I didn't get to try any of the pastries or sandwiches, and I'd love to come back to try the peach latte that Sofia L raves about, for now, I'll just say that this is a local business with good espresso and friendly staff that's in an old gas station - how cool is that?!

There seems to be a bit of debate going on between the existing Arlecchino reviewers: is Arlecchino's gelato better or worse than the gelato in Italy? Well, that's sort of like asking whether the cheese steaks at a highly-rated cheese steak shop in L.A. run by an individual born and raised in Philadelphia are better than the ones you get in Philadelphia. The answer is that every  food's place of origin has businesses that make it well and places that make it not so well. Therefore, while it's probable that Italy and Philadelphia have *more* places that make better gelato and cheese steaks, respectively, there are certainly places elsewhere in the world that make these products superbly, especially if the owners are themselves authentic, as well as dedicated to their craft.   Being an Italophile myself, I always love discovering restaurants and food destinations run by Italians. 9 times out of 10, their product will be memorable and will remind me of the best version I had while in Italy (I've spent 9 months there over 5 visits). Arlecchino is no exception. The owner is Italian (you can still hear the accent), and he makes all of his gelatos from scratch, with the passion you would expect from an individual whose native culture centers around fresh, delicious, and satisfying food.   I tried Arlecchino with fellow Yelpers after the Radio Milano Elite event (that restaurant is right across the street). Thank you, Jason W, for the suggestion. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor I chose (Peanut Butter Chocolate) and found the texture and consistency to be super-authentic. The price was also really reasonable, given what a lot of upscale ice cream/yogurt shops are charging these days. The owner, who was scooping and running the register, seemed personable, and it was so nice to see him so involved with the nuts and bolts of the business.   The only downside to my Arlecchino experience was that I didn't get to compare certain flavors to the ones I tried in Italy (hazelnut, pistachio, mixed berry, etc.). Since I ordered peanut butter/chocolate, this inability to compare is definitely my own fault, though, so I won't fault Arlecchino! The owners are doing Italian gelato proud, and that deserves five stars.

Acacia Cafe does not have the most mind-blowing breakfast I've ever had and a few of the dishes could stand to be a little more flavorful, but in my opinion, there are two things that rocket this cute little spot right up to a four-star rating:  1) The prices are really low for the quality you get. 2) You can get actual hot breakfast favorites in a coffee-shop setting.   We took two friends who were in town there last Sunday (when Acacia features a special expanded hot breakfast menu, with 5-6 additional selections) and we were all pleasantly surprised by the fact that we were able to get five tasty and high-quality breakfast items and three juices for under $50. The Monte Cristo sandwich could have used some improvement  - the bread was pretty dry and didn't have that great moist, eggy French toast flavor - and the orange pecan pancakes just tasted like regular pancakes with some pecans and orange slices on top. That being said, the Southwestern Eggs Benedict was phenomenal and the strawberry waffles were rich and delicious, just the way I like them! The orange juice (which came in small and large) was also really fresh.   The woman who took our order was also super friendly and added to the neighborhood feel of the place. Once we placed the order, we sat down at the little cafe tables and waited for our food. The food didn't come out super quickly but this is understandable given that everything was made fresh to order. I definitely like breakfast places with waiter service, but it was definitely nice to have a more cafe-like feel for a change, and I'm sure that the more casual service concept trickles down to us, the consumers, in the form of lower prices.   I will definitely be back to Acacia for breakfast at some point soon!

I now work just a few minutes away from Acacia and got lunch from there today. Based on the reviews, I decided to try the veggie panini ($6.50). It was solidly delicious but not stellar. In particular, the foccacia was a bit dry. I think that the not-so-Vigan sandwich at the nearby Vig (that may not be the exact name of the sandwich, but it's close) is a lot better (albeit $2 or $3 dollars more expensive). I still think this spot is a quality and affordable lunch spot, and the service is always outstanding, but I'm not adding on the extra star based on the veggie sandwich I tried.

I can't give Clarendon the full five stars because I haven't actually stayed there as a hotel guest, but I think the modern decor, striking lobby, rooftop deck, and cordial staff merit four stars even though I haven't seen the rooms. We had a friend in town for the weekend and I thought it would be fun to stop by in the early evening to grab a drink and hang out on the rooftop deck. We were so happy we did because the panoramic views from the deck were absolutely stunning (hard to believe that you can see so much just by going up six floors) and the drinks that the bartender stationed on the roof mixed for us were really good (he makes a mean, not-too-sweet margarita if that's your thing!).   There weren't many other people there (it was a Sunday night around 6 pm) - ok, to be honest, we were the only people on the rooftop deck (although the restaurant/bar and pool area were a little more occupied), but in some ways, that was part of the charm. We just got our drinks, sat down on the very modern and super-comfortable orange sectionals, and caught up on each other's news while watching the amazingly beautiful sunset reflect off the buildings downtown and the mountains on all sides of us.   If you are in town for a weekend getaway and want to stay somewhere with a more urban feel (but also get a chance to see Phoenix's natural beauty at night), I think you would really enjoy staying here. There is also a lot within walking distance, which isn't true of many nicer Phoenix-area hotels. Or, you could do what we did and just stop by for an hour or two and enjoy some good drinks on the amazing rooftop deck!

In my opinion, a good sandwich is hard to find. I'm not a huge sandwich person, and I usually prefer sandwiches that are more like a good entree that just happens to be between two slices of bread. The veggie melt ($9) at City Bakery was a lot like that - fresh veggies (tomatoes, red peppers, artichoke hearts, and wild mushrooms) in a really tangy marinade with hummus and goat cheese just happened to have found their way between two slices of foccacia, even though their ultimate destination could have been an antipasto plate or a Mediterranean sampler. Cerebral, I know, but in my opinion, that's what a good sandwich is all about!   My husband's sandwich, on the other hand, was not really a collection of well-matched, stand-out ingredients paired with complementary bread. It was the Roasted Chicken sandwich ($9). Instead of tasting like chicken pulled off of a roasted whole bird and paired with bread and cheese, it tasted like dried pieces of chicken breast that were practically drowning in goat cheese and then masked with two enormous slices of baguette. Not so great.   The white bean salad that comes on the side of the sandwiches was one of the best side dishes I've had in a long time. It was seasoned with light olive oil and filled with tangy sun-dried tomatoes. I just wished that it had been a larger portion - four spoonfuls, and it was gone.   I would order that veggie melt sandwich again in a second. But, I hope that more of their $9 - $10 sandwiches feature more than just dry and pretty flavorless meat thrown onto some bread and sent off to the customer without a second thought. For that price, we deserve better.

As several reviewers have already said, this place is a wonderful spot for a quality-driven and affordable happy hour experience. The bar food is all 50% off during happy hour and well drinks are $4. We went around 6 pm and had two well drinks, a delicious Kobe burger, a chicken sandwich, and ahi tuna for ~$22. What a deal! The bartender was very cordial, and we had a great time sitting at the bar enjoying our meal and drinks (and, yes, I said MEAL!). I love happy hours that let you have a whole dinner but pay half the price! If you're ever in the South mountain area or near the Baseline/Guadalupe exit on the I-10, you should definitely check this place out for happy hour.

Dear Vig Hater,  If you don't like going to places with snobby, "Scottsdale" patrons, don't pick a restaurant/bar that looks trendy, has trendy menu descriptions, and describes itself as a "modern tavern." If you want something more laidback, find yourself a local spot with a more casual feel and leave the Vig alone!  Christine  Dear Christine,  It's definitely possible that a trendy place draws a crowd who either is or considers themselves trendy, but I have another problem with the Vig: it's in a sketchy neighborhood! I don't feel comfortable coming here at night or parking next to the check cashing place.   Vig Hater  Dear Vig Hater,   The area around the Vig borders Arcadia, considered one of the nicest neighborhoods in Phoenix. I wonder where you live that you consider this area "ghetto." If you have an aversion to check cashing joints and Circle Ks, I strongly suggest you never make the field trip to Pizza A Metro.  Christine  Dear Christine,  But isn't the food at the Vig not that great?  Vig Hater  Dear Vig Hater,  There, I'm going to have to meet you in the middle. My veggie sandwich (called "The Vigan") with a side of sweet potato fries was really well-prepared, but I can see some of the other dishes being more amusingly-named than well-executed. Since this place is only two minutes from my office, I plan to go back for happy hour or dinner. I will definitely update when I do.   Christine  TO BE CONTINUED...

Dear Vig Hater,  I went back to The Vig for happy hour a few weeks ago, and I'm going to have to officially declare my disagreement with you. Even thought it was ridiculously crowded (and we had to wait for a seat on the patio at a mere 5 p.m.!), I thought the happy hour scene was dynamic and exciting; people were having a lot of fun, and the whole place felt alive. Plus, the well drinks were really cheap and the duck & mushroom quesadilla I had was really well-executed and satisfying. I would return here for lunch or happy hour in a second, and that my friend, makes for a five-star experience.   Christine

Definitely agree with Alicia B that this place is a better version of Panera (which, as an aside, apparently used to be much better when it was a St. Louis chain and not a national enterprise with 1000+ stores). What always disappoints me about Panera is that the sandwiches sound really good in the menu descriptions but are rather disappointing in their ingredient quality and execution. Luckily for me, Wildflower, which is only 3 minutes from my office, has great-sounding sandwiches that live up to their descriptions.   So far, I've tried the Roasted Sweet Potato sandwich (with roasted sweet potato, fresh mozzarella, fig confit, tomato, arugula, marinated fennel and balsamic vinaigrette on herb foccacia), which was absolutely wonderful. I was worried that the ingredients were random and wouldn't necessarily fit together, but I found that the sweetness of the sweet potato and fig combined perfectly with the creaminess of the mozzarella, the bitterness of the arugula and fennel, and the acidity of the balsamic. What a truly impressive vegetarian sandwich!   I also love the Mixed Grill sandwich (featuring ham, roasted turkey breast, swiss, cheddar, caramelized onions, dill pickle, and honey mustard on herb bread). It's a lot simpler than the Sweet Potato sandwich but still features great, fresh flavors that all go really well together. Both sandwiches are really large and are only $7.19 (including a side).  I'm giving Wildflower a 4 rather than a 5 because the side (the signature slaw) and cookie (cranberry oatmeal) I tried weren't as impressive as the sandwiches. I much prefer the slaw from City Bakery and the cookies from Panera. All in all, though, Wildflower really impressed me, and I am sure I will return many times to get a great gourmet sandwich for a relatively low price. I've also heard great things about the pumpkin soup, so I will have to try that at some point soon.

Holy crap. I have found the holy grail of veggie sandwiches. As anyone who eats with me often knows (and as you can probably tell from my reviews), I tend to prefer vegetarian lunch options than meat ones. Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I'm picky about meat quality and I often don't think meat adds much to sandwiches, so I tend to stick to sandwiches with roasted vegetables and cheese or a pita with hummus/falafel.   Anyway, I had already tried the roasted sweet potato sandwich at Wildflower - although the fig confit was a bit too sweet for me, it definitely went well with the mozzarella and the sweet potato. Then, last week at work, I tried the Portabello Picnic (roasted portobello, zucchini, eggplant, roma tomato, arugula and herb goat cheese on grilled Pasilla Chili Rye) and thought it was really, really good. Often, restaurants totally overcook portabellos and eggplant but this portobello, eggplant, and zucchini was tender (but not mushy) and tasted perfectly fresh. The herb goat cheese and slightly savory rye bread complemented each other and provided the perfect finishes to the delicious roasted vegetables. Loved every bite!  Even if you're not a vegetarian, I think you will find this sandwich hearty and satisfying.

My husband and I went to Yasu about a week ago. It's the first Japanese restaurant we've tried since we moved to Phoenix about a month ago - we decided to go based on the stellar Yelp reviews and were definitely not disappointed. I can't give Yasu all five stars because some of the hot dishes we tried were not as flavorful as we had hoped (based on the reviews and the prices!), but we found the sushi and other fish dishes to be really fresh and flavorful, the service to be attentive, and the overall vibe to be trendy but laid-back. We started with two rolls - Spicy Yellowtail (~$7) and the Phoenix (shrimp tempura) (~$9) - which were both perfect. The rice was the right consistency (not too sticky or soggy) and the fish was fresher than most we've had in California, let alone the desert. At the recommendation of our server, we tried the octopus carpaccio, one of the daily specials, and fell in love. The octopus was sweet and tender and topped with a delicious sauce and sliced jalapenos. Next, another special (the miso eggplant) arrived and it was amazing - tender with a sweet and incredibly flavorful brown sauce. Up until this point, we were in love with everything about our Yasu experience. The next two dishes were a little disappointing. The rib-eye steak that everyone raved about was pretty much just that - rib-eye steak. It wasn't that tender and it didn't have much flavor besides that of the grill. The dipping sauces were good but didn't really make up for how inherently standard the steak tasted. The shrimp fondue dish was also disappointing - it was basically just shrimp covered in batter that you dipped in boiling sweet and sour sauce. The shrimp tasted frozen and the whole dish just felt a little forced. However, these two dishes aside, we loved Yasu for the fresh sushi (which is probably harder to find that good Asian-inspired steak), the amazing octopus and eggplant, and the good service. We would definitely go back.

Ok, I rarely give establishments one star, especially not when I initially gave the place three stars or above. I will have to make an exception for Sun Asian Kitchen. The first time my husband and I went there (the experience I based my first review on), the food definitely wasn't outstanding or authentic, but it was decent. The fact that it was the only non-hole-in-the-wall Asian place in South Phoenix also made me settle on a solid three stars.   Last night, on my way back from Tucson, my husband called in an order and I went to pick it up. We got the crab wontons, chicken chow fun, and Mongolian beef. When I got home with the food (after waiting 10 extra minutes for the food to be ready), we sat down to eat, ready for some standard but satisfying Chinese.   Well, we were in for a big disappointment. The food was awful, literally disgusting. To start with, the chicken in the chow fun was literally formed and the farthest thing from breast you can get - my husband said it reminded him of the way the chicken meat in McNuggets used to be before they upgraded to all white meat. I figure if McDonalds can make the switch, so can this place. I picked out all the chicken, hoping that the chow fun would at least be decent, but it was super-oily, so much so it was almost inedible. The crab wontons had literally two flecks of artificial crab in them and were basically stuffed with straight cream cheese. Not good. The beef was also terrible quality, the only saving grace of the dish being the flavorful sauce and scallions. We both felt really sick after the little we did eat and wished that we had taken our $25 and gone to Panda Express instead. Yeah, it was that bad.   The biggest irony of all is that the restaurant actually claims that they use top-quality meat. On their website, they state that they only use  "top quality meat, seafood  and  the  freshest  garden vegetables to cook your food  to ensure  an authentic and memorable eating experience." Yeah. Right. I know there's a recession going on, but serving meat worse than McDonald's is inexcusable and will certainly keep us from spending our valuable food dollars there. A place called Pan Asia (advertises itself is having sushi and Chinese fusion) is about to open up across the street (24th and Baseline) in the center; it will be exciting to have another Asian restaurant in South Phoenix to choose from, and I hope that the competition will force Sun Asian Kitchen to live up to their own promise to use only the highest-quality ingredients.

This market is literally around the corner from our house. I had driven by it a bunch of times when we first moved in but just thought it was yet another convenience/liquor store until I read Kristin C's awesome review. I had no idea that that little place had so much history! I sent Kristin a compliment for her review and said that I was planning to stop by, but she wrote back saying that the place was under new ownership and that I might not find the market to be the same as when she went to it back in March of 2007. She was right.   On the way home the other night, we decided to stop to get some soda water and limes. We found it to be a fairly well-stocked market (they had limes but not soda water, although that seems to fairly common around here, since neither Fresh & Easy nor CVS carries it) with a good selection of wine and refrigerated goods (including tortillas). The woman working was extremely friendly and suggested a Mexican sparkling mineral water instead of the soda water they didn't carry. However, I didn't see all of the amazing homemade goods or antiques/collectibles that Kristin described. These (along with the plans for dog treats and an adjoining restaurant) may have disappeared when the ownership changed.   That being said, this is still a great little neighborhood spot with tons of character and really friendly employees. Given how close it is to our house, I'm sure we'll be back all the time to pick up limes, beer/wine, or other food items.

This place can feel a bit stuffy-steakhouse, and its view certainly does not compare to the one in Oakland, CA (which overlooks the bay and has a fabulous view of the SF skyline), but it does a really great job creating solid steakhouse classics with modern twists. The Broadway Pea Salad is a nice way to get some veggies without eating lettuce. The Prime Rib is beyond belief and will make it difficult to enjoy the same cut elsewhere. The Lavender Cosmo is a really good cocktail and comes in a glass rimmed with lavender-infused sugar. When we went a few weeks ago, they had a delicious and inventive dessert - ice cream sandwiches made from chipotle brownies with cherry brandy ice cream. We noticed on the door that they also have late happy hour - want to go back and try that at some point.

Just wanted to add more information about Kincaid's happy hour(s):  Looks like they have happy hour *every day* from 4pm-6pm and reverse happy hour from 9pm-close! During these two time blocks, all appetizers are half off and mojitos, house chardonnay/cabernet, and all beers on tap are only $3. Yeah, I'll be heading back there for one of these happy hours very soon!

I already really liked Kincaid's as a fancier dinner option, but thanks to Sunny B (who went to check out their happy hour based on the information I saw on the door when I was there for dinner), I tried their happy hour, and I was impressed enough to bump this place up to 5 stars.   There is a list of 10 or so appetizers that are pulled from the regular menu, and all are 50% off during happy hour. Drink specials (mojitos, margaritas, draft beers, house chardonnay/cabernet) are actually $4 now, but that's still damn cheap! It's also worth noting that even outside of happy hour, they have a short bar menu that is much cheaper than their normal fare.   We had five appetizers (macadamia-nut encrusted Brie w/ sliced house bread, fried calamari, sweet potato fries, teriyaki tenderloins w/ rice, and Kobe meatloaf sliders), one margarita, and two glasses of wine, and our total cheack was $38.50! That would be a sweet deal even if the appetizers weren't good, but all of them were excellent and quite filling. We essentially got a full dinner, which always makes for a successful happy hour!  Our server, Jennifer, was also super courteous and attentive. She was available when we needed her but didn't rush us either. We also really appreciated when she offered me a second glass of wine "at happy hour price" even though it was basically 6 pm already.   If you live anywhere near the Collier Center (corner of 2nd Street and Washington), work downtown, or have friends that work downtown, you will want to check this place out for happy hour. We couldn't believe how empty Kincaid's was, despite offering these crazy and wonderful happy hour deals, but I'd like to believe that after this review, it won't be! Check it out - you won't be disappointed.

If you live close by, this is a great spot for some good old-fashioned karaoke (on Thursdays and Sundays) and really, really cheap drinks. We went for the first time last night and had a great time. Staff and patrons were all very friendly.

I haven't been to the location yet, so I can't comment on that. However, my husband and I got 8 of these in the mail the other day as a gift and they were pretty damn delicious. The tropical one (with pineapple and coconut) was especially unique and flavorful. I doubt I'd order them as a gift (since they are $25 or so for 8 cookies), but I'm impressed with the couple who started the business' entrepreneurship and really enjoyed the cookies. I do wish they would have done a better job editing the text on the inside of the box - a bunch of the sentences didn't make sense and it looked more like a teenage girls' IM conversation than marketing copy. Oh, well - I still have 4 cookies in the freezer to be thawed in enjoyed in, let's say, the next 48 hours!

My biggest complaint about Pita Jungle is its name, which makes the place sound more like a fast-food Mediterranean joint like Extreme Pita than an upscale, healthy restaurant. In fact, even though I've worked nearby for over three months now and driven by countless times, I've avoided going there because I didn't know it was the kind of place it is. Of course, I know now, but I think the name was a poor choice for communicating what the restaurant's all about.   Anyway, that little naming issue aside, Pita Jungle is a great choice for a time when you'd like to have a sit-down lunch or dinner but pay reasonable prices that are more reflective of a faster dining option. Additionally, the portions are very large for the price. I went with a co-worker, and our two dishes and two sodas came out to less than $20 total. While none of the menu choices seemed mind-blowingly creative to me, my co-workers swears by the black bean burger and I thought my falafel pita was light and flavorful (and a steal at only $5.25!).   Now that I know that Pita Jungle is a restaurant serving fresh and healthy food, I have a feeling I'll be back pretty often.

I first learned about Dream Dinners when my friend Camie invited me to a private event there. To sign up, i had to go the Dream Dinners website, find the session/time, enter the "secret password" (ours was "mimosa" which was a good sign!) and then select the meals you want to make. A few observations/facts from my ordering experience:  *You order in 3- or 6-serving increments  *The minimum order is 36 servings *The average price per serving is somewhere between $3 and $6 *Virtually every option had meat as a main ingredient  Given that I'm a fish-eating vegetarian and I don't have kids, I'm probably not squarely in the middle of Dream Dinners' target market. But Camie really wanted me to make it to the event and insisted that I give Laura, the owner, a call. So I did. She was very helpful and accommodating and told me that not only could I sub fish or shrimp for any of the meat or chicken options (although it might be an extra charge), but they also had soy strips available at no extra cost. Plus, she agreed to let me do an 18-serving trial. Sweet! There's nothing I love more than a business owner who will go that extra mile to earn my business.   Well, the event itself was really fun. Mimosas were a-flowin' (they let the event host bring alcohol with no extra fee) and my sister, Abigail O, and I had a lot of fun assembling all of the ingredient bags. Making the calzone was also really fun! The facilities themselves were super clean and well air-conditioned, and it was just a great, easy experience. The staff was also on hand to help with any missing ingredients or answer questions.   The other highlight of the event was showing Laura the features of Yelp for business owners. From the looks of the business listing, she's gone in and taken full advantage of them. I really respect business owners that will experiment with new ways to get customers and I welcome her to the Yelp community :)  Oh, and you're probably wondering whether the food is good. I'm happy to report that the things I've tried so far have been good. Being totally obsessed with spicy, flavorful ethnic food, I don't think I'd have Dream Dinners every night, but the convenience, solid, dependable flavors and great service are definitely going to make it an option for me in my busy life!

In our six months living in South Phoenix, my husband and I avoided this place, thinking that it would just be another Applebee's, Chili's, Native New Yorker - you know, a chain with typical, bland American food. We finally decided to check it out last Wednesday night (our night for a mid-week outing) and were pleasantly surprised.   We sat out on the covered patio, which is really nice. It's really spacious, has two sections (one with low tables and one with high tables), features three huge flat screens, and has plenty of misters. You can also smoke on the patio, since the entrance to the restaurant is around the other side.   Our server greeted us promptly and was very friendly. To drink, we ordered vodka sodas, which were priced very well at $2.75 a pop! We noticed that on the menu they feature tons of different burger preparations/styles and let you choose your patty type (between an Angus patty, Kobe patty (for $3 more), a chicken breast, turkey burger, and a veggie patty) and your bread type (ciabatta, sesame bun, multigrain bun, sourdough, multigrain bread, rye, and bed of lettuce, which is nice for those watching their carb intake!). We had heard good things about their veggie burger, so we got the Southwestern style burger with the veggie patty. We also got the seasoned fries and a dozen hot honey BBQ wings (which are $.40 each on Wednesdays).   All in all, we were really impressed with the food. The veggie burger was among the best I've had, the fries were crispy and not too greasy, and the wings were flavorful with a nice kick of spice. We also only spent $30 or so for all of the food and three drinks.   This is a great spot for some mid-week relaxation, cheap drinks, and solid food. With the weather as nice as it is right now, the patio is also a great feature. We will most definitely return.

It's hard to find a good vet these days. I swear that the tainted pet food crisis of last year made vets even more likely to push unnecessary and expensive "recommended" tests, treatments, and pills on pet owners. What happened to vets that just love animals? Anyway, I selected this vet because my husband and I adopted two 2-month old kittens from the AZ Humane Society's Campus for Compassion on Friday and VCA is the selected provider of the free (within 5 days) appointment that you get after adopting from a shelter. Having adopted four previous shelter cats, my husband and I have been to a few of these free appointments. Usually, the vets seem upset that they have to give services free even though these appointments give them an opportunity to secure future clientele, and they try to convince you to add a bunch of bloodwork or fecal exams to the bill. This vet did not.   Furthermore, they cover up to $500 of necessary medical services for specified respiratory, digestive, and other conditions for each pet that is adopted from the Humane Society (this is in addition to the free first appointment and free goodies!). The Office Manager and front desk staff were super friendly when I was checking in. They offered me free kitten food and printed cat ownership information. The technician was gentle and patient, and the vet himself was really kind and seemed to genuinely be interested in the kittens and their well-being. I'm sorry that this hospital is so far from our house because otherwise, we would return to them in a second for our two new feline babies and our two existing cats.

I second Kristin's nomination of this Target as the best Target ever! It's a super-clean and well-stocked location, and the staff is definitely really friendly and helpful. Every time I've gone, I've had employees ask me if I needed help finding anything, and today, when I had a full cart and left my wallet in the car, one of the team members offered to watch my cart while I ran out to the car. It also has a Starbucks inside, which is a huge plus for those Saturday or Sunday morning trips!

The way I feel about Rubio's is pretty much the way I feel about Panda Express - if you have to eat there as an alternative to the real thing, you'll have an acceptable meal but wish you had gone somewhere spicier/more authentic/less greasy. Their chips and salsa bar isn't bad, and some of their food items (like the new grilled veggie tacos) are decent, but many other items just fall short. Also, anything that has shrimp in it features tiny, bland-tasting shrimp and will cost you extra. If you have to, go ahead, but in this neighborhood (and in the rest of Phoenix), you'll be able to find better Mexican food for lower prices.

When my sister and I were little, we used to rebel against the very idea of a thrift store. We hated the smell (you know, the one that reminds you of visiting a nursing home) and were horrified by the thought of wearing something someone else had worn.  To this day, I'm still not thrilled by the idea of hand-me-downs from an unidentified stranger. That being said, my husband and I stumbled upon the every other Saturday 50% off sale at the Goodwill on Camelback and have been pretty excited about going back since. We were in this part of Tempe this morning, saw this location, and realized that it was not only a much bigger location than the Camelback one but also that it was again 50% off Saturday.   We didn't spend long here--there's that smell, after all--but we did come out victorious. For $40, we emerged with two *huge* house plants for $7.50 each, a gorgeous silver pot/vase for $5, 3 sun dresses for me at $3.50 each and a t-shirt for $2.50. Once I wash the clothes with my own detergent, all I'll remember is that I would have paid $100 or so for these items anywhere else.   If you can get past the physical and psychological barriers to buying used clothing, you might find some really cute and cheap items--and score yourself some deals on home decor items. And, as you can imagine, the foray into used-goods land feels all the more worth it when you go on a 50% off Saturday and get the stuff for even cheaper.

Sol y Sombra was really far to drive from South Phoenix, but was totally worth it - the tapas were really high-quality and flavorful for the price. We had reserved a table on OpenTable.com but were about 20 minutes late (we took the first Pima Road exit on 101 instead of the second - anyone know what I'm talking about?!), so we got seated at a table in the bar area. It was definitely a good spot for people-watching but not as romantic (or quiet) as some of the tables in the main area seemed. Oh well! At least we got to see some of Scottsdale's best (and worst) dressed. I went to a really elite prep school in Los Angeles, but I was on financial aid and never really part of the in crowd. When I would sit around imagining what my cool peers did together in their spare time, I imagined something like the bar scene at Sol Y Sombra - girls in flowered dresses and heels flitting around guys in European wear with expensive watches.   Ah, well, I digress. The tapas were simply delicious. We had the tortilla espanola, stuffed piquillo pepper, sauteed clams (or were they mussels?) with chorizo, baby back ribs, calamari, manchego cheese/serrano ham/fig. The calamari was a real standout - as my husband commented, this calamari's crust was what restaurants are trying to achieve when they say that their calamari is "lightly fried." To finish the meal, we had the vanilla scented grilled pear with goat cheese and almonds. It might be one of the best things I've ever tried and it was the perfect end to the meal. All told, the food we had (7 dishes) was about $80. My Matador cocktail (tasted like tequila with orange juice) was $8. Not too bad for really light, fresh, flavorful tapas! And if you felt marginalized in highschool, you might feel empowered showing up and being one of  (or near) the in crowd at Sol y Sombra. Just don't forget to dress your best!

We went back to T-Bone last night with a friend from out of town. We had vodka sodas, which were well-mixed and cheap. My husband and I tried the "combo" (only $15) this time, which featured 1/4 of a chicken and a fillet - the chicken was just as moist and delicious as last time, and the fillet was so tender and cooked to just the right level of doneness I requested (as was my husband and my friend's meat). The sides were just as unremarkable as last time, but the meat was even more flavorful than I remember. That flavor, combined with the delicious apple pie a la mode and the incredible view, which was amazing to share with our guest, makes me bump T-Bone up a star.

My husband and I were in Mesa to go to California Pools' office, and I wanted to try a place in the area that had good reviews. Thanks to Anandita and Ropryo's glowing reviews, we decided to try Bejarong and were definitely not disappointed. We love Wild Thaiger (http://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-thaiger-phoenix#hrid:zfCY37S7fV5Nuy_tn-8chg) and Malee's Thai Bistro (http://www.yelp.com/biz/malees-thai-bistro-at-desert-ridge-phoenix#hrid:f05UYWsJKAfrx5o5srSXCg) for upscale Thai in a trendy environment, but ever since we moved to Phoenix, we have been looking for that hole-in-the-wall, no-frills Thai spot. Benjarong was just that type of place. The server was really friendly and gave us big glasses of ice water almost immediately after we sat down. We ordered Pad Thai with chicken ($8.95) and red curry with beef  ($8.95) and were really happy with both dishes. Pad Thai tends to be overly sweet and/or peanuty, but this version had just a hint of all the right things (tamarind, peanut, fish sauce) and let the flavor of the rice noodles and perfectly cooked chicken breast shine through. We asked for it medium and the chef added real pieces of chili that were perfectly spread throughout the dish and added tons of great flavor. The curry was also delicious. We asked for it spicy, so there wasn't a ton of coconut flavor, which a lot of people expect, but the flavor was very authentic and robust. The beef was a little overdone, but the veggies and pineapple all tasted very fresh and were cooked perfectly. For a little over $20, we had an authentic, flavorful Thai meal and we left feeling very satisfied. We will definitely make the drive from South Phoenix to eat here again!

Spokes has a little bit of an identity crisis, which is why I'm docking it one star. On the outside, it looks like a little cafe, and a big sign that says "Ride hard, Run hard, Eat healthy, Be happy" and lists their offerings as "Coffee, Smoothies, Juicers (no, no, not THOSE kind, silly!), Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Wine Bar." It kind of reminded me of one of those check-cashing joints that also performs a myriad of unrelated services, like dry-cleaning. When we walked inside, we saw the truth - Spokes is actually a down-home bar with an algae-ridden aquarium, pool room with an ocean scene on the wall, and plenty of male clientele that just happens to offer good, fresh food and smoothies in the morning! We sat at the bar and had vodka/sodas ($3.25 during happy hour!), a half order of the Spicy Garlic wings (~$6), and some nachos with grilled beef (~$7). The drinks were delicious for being well, and the food was really good! As Eric already said, the Spicy Garlic wings were to-die-for; they were so flavorful and had just the right amount of kick. The nachos were also fabulous - the fact that the chips were homemade made the whole dish that much better, and the cheese was real, fresh cheddar and jack. The drinks were also generously sized. Our bartender was really nice and attentive, despite the constant demands for second, third, and fourth beers being yelled his way. We definitely want to come back, although we still can't decide if we want to try the breakfast there.  Apparently, they have karaoke on Wednesday nights, with the same KJ who does the karaoke nights at Silver Pony (just down the road at Dobbins and 7th Ave), so that may end up being our night of choice!

We went back to Spokes a few weeks ago for karaoke, and it was really fun! Apparently, it's not actually the guy from Silver Pony who does the karaoke. It was a different guy, but he was really cool and supportive of everyone singing, and his sound system was really quality. We sang, ordered some cheap drinks, and had the wings again :-)

Heavenly! After hearing and reading about the Farm at South Mountain, my husband and I were definitely excited about trying Quiessence (the upscale wine bar/restaurant located on the property) and The Farm Kitchen (the casual lunch place also on the property), but decided that we would try Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast first. Good, quality breakfast is hard to come by in the South Mountain area, so we figured starting there in the Farm trifecta would make the most sense (and be the most rewarding). We definitely weren't disappointed!   We walked up to the outdoor seating area and selected a table (please note that if you pull in from 32nd Street, Morning Glory Cafe and Quiessence are down the long path on the side of the property away from 32nd, while the Farm Kitchen is immediately to your right when you pull in). The server directed us to the beverage station, where we had some slightly-watery lemonade and some *really* good coffee. It was rich and flavorful without being acidic.   Our food came very promptly (do note, however, that we came on a weekday morning - I imagine the wait is longer on weekends and holidays) - my husband had the chicken enchiladas topped with eggs, and I had the Monte Cristo. We both agreed that the enchiladas were delicious - the chicken was really savory, the sauce tasted very authentic, and the eggs were the perfect complement - but the real standout was the Monte Cristo (ham and swiss cheese between two slice of French toast). The ham was crispy, the cheese tasted so fresh and light, and the bread was thick and as homemade as you can get. The maple syrup also tasted high-quality. The combination of the salty and sweet was unbeatable. Both of our entrees were in the $10-$12 range, and the price included the unlimited coffee, lemonade, water, and tea from the beverage station.   This place has delicious breakfast and atmosphere for great prices and is definitely worth trying. Please note that it (along with the Farm Kitchen but *not* Quiessence will be closed from June 2nd to September).

Morning Glory (along with the Farm Kitchen, the other more casual dining spot at the Farm at South Mountain) re-opened on September 9th after being closed for the summer. We missed being able to go there for breakfast, but on the other hand, would not have been happy or comfortable sitting outside with a hot breakfast in the broiling Phoenix sun and my thighs sticking to the plastic chair. Right. So, it's a good idea that they close for the summer. But I digress.   I have three reasons for my update:   1. The Monte Cristo sandwich was still delicious (those farm-fresh eggs and cheese are so good!), but the bread that was so crispy and artisan last time was soggy and too syrupy this time. Note to chefs: the bread is what makes the sandwich complete, so get it right.  2. The chicken fried steak (served with creamy gravy and rosemary potatoes and topped with one of their delicious, farm-raised eggs) was ridiculously good. The batter was light and crispy and the gravy was the perfect creamy and pepper complement. Try it. You won't regret it.  3. When the server offers you a muffin or pastry after taking your order, don't accept unless you want to pay $2.50 for it. We fell for that trick and ended up paying for an orange muffin that was ok but kind of filled us up before we got to the good stuff.   Definitely still amazing, and definitely still worth checking out. I don't think the lunch spot (Farm Kitchen) is as delicious, so if you're only going to pick one of the two, definitely try Morning Glory. Of course, you could also opt for Quiessence, the formal restaurant at the Farm, which I still haven't tried but hear is awesome. A sign at the Farm said they are now open for lunch and afternoon snacks. But, again, I digress.

This is a cute little cafe in Phoenix's oldest hotel that serves relatively affordable and tasty lunch fare in a comfortable and friendly environment that looks out onto the streets of downtown. It still amazes me that spots this cozy and cheap can exist in a major city's downtown. To me, that's part of Phoenix's charm.Where else can you work downtown and walk just a block or two from your office tower to have a really nice and affordable lunch in a place quiet enough to have a conversation?   I took my parents and grandmother here when they were in town last weekend. We found street parking spots after only circling a few times and then lingered over lunch here for an hour or so. I don't remember everything that everyone ordered, but my portobello sandwich was really tasty and my mom's salad (with dried cranberries and crumbled cheese) was really fresh and huge! Five of us ended up eating lunch (along with sodas, a smoothie, and cookie) for only $45 or so, and it was fun to sit by the big glass windows and watch the lunch hour downtown evolve.   This is a great lunch spot either for people working in the heart of downtown or anyone visiting who wants to see downtown and grab lunch while there.

The only thing I really like about this downtown eatery is the sprawling outside patio. The service and food were definitely sub-par and I doubt I'd ever return for lunch again.   For starters, the service was ridiculously slow. I understand that it's downtown and it's crowded at lunch but the servers need to be better at managing the lunch crowd. Lunch crowds order less and need to be in and out and any good restaurant in a business-oriented area will be good at that revolving door model. I mean, it's not like we're waiting for hand-rolled sushi or hand-crafted cocktails here. We simply wanted to place our order in a timely fashion, get our sodas and waters quickly and then have our food come out in a reasonable amount of time. None of those things really happened.   I was also super unimpressed with the food. Being a vegetarian who occasionally eats fish, I was immediately drawn to the baba ganoush. I figured I often have falafel and that it would be nice to try something new and a bit heartier. I realize that that dish is supposed to be a bit mushy (sort of like ratatouille), but it was literally soggy and dripping with oil. The rice on the side was also dry and the bechamel sauce was overwhelming and flavorless. It also really turned me off that I couldn't get it on the side because according to the waiter, it was "already mixed in." I'm all for no substitutions or changes, but not when the food's not actually faster as a result.   This place is a lot of hype and not a lot of substance and I think your money would be much better spent at more of a hole-in-the-wall Mediterranean joint. If you're feeling like a quick drive down Van Buren, you could even check out Al-Hana, the extremely affordable and delicious eatery inside the Baiz Market.

Sala Thai was the latest stop on my husband's and my quest for the holy grail, a.k.a. our search to find satisfying and authentic Thai food in Phoenix. I must say that Sala Thai is among the best places we've tried since we arrived here from California.   We met Jim W and Audrey W (our fellow voyagers on our Thai food search) for dinner at Sala last Sunday night. As Jim mentioned in his review, Sala Thai isn't nearly as far away from South Phoenix or Chandler as you would think it is, especially on a weekend night when traffic is minimal. The restaurant was decently crowded when we arrived, but we got a nice booth just a minute or so after.   It took us a while to decide what to order as the menu was huge and had a lot of new, interesting dishes like the "Thai Egg Bomb" (think Thai omelette, not the sulphuric smell released after eating too much Pad See Ew). After a long deliberation (thank you to our waitress for being patient with us!), we selected the pork satay appetizer, Pad Thai with chicken, catfish Panang curry, spicy basil fried rice with beef, and the duck curry. Just as at Swaddee (our favorite Thai place so far), we were asked to select a spiciness level from 1 - 5. We picked a different level for each dish, so we could see what the range of spiciness was like.   Well, as Jim also mentioned in his review, the pork satay was disappointing - while the peanut sauce was great and not too sweet, the pork was overdone and chewy. The duck curry was decent, although it was a little milky for my taste. I prefer my curry to have a thicker consistency and less coconut milk. The duck was great, though, with a nice crispy skin. Similarly, the crispy catfish topped with panang curry could have been improved with a thicker and more intense curry. The fish was good-quality, however, and was definitely a nice mild compliment to the curry's spiciness.   The real stand-outs for me were the basil fried rice and the Pad Thai. The Pad Thai had an almost meaty flavor to it (must be a different regional version of the dish than the sweet/sour or peanuty versions that are served at most Thai places), and was just the right level of sauciness. I was also impressed with the quality of the chicken. The basil fried rice was outstanding as well - the beef was perfectly tender and flavorful, and the crispy bits of basil added a wonderful flavor.   Since the curries are what keep me coming back to a Thai place, I was a little disappointed that Sala's weren't as good as those I've had elsewhere in the area. However, our meal was highly flavorful and enjoyable, and I would definitely rank Sala up towards the top of the places we've tried in Phoenix (see my list at http://www.yelp.com/list_details?list_id=Pa46iQOM92L75uQoyyuRlQ).   Jim and Audrey - I look forward to the next stop on our tour!

I'm truly surprised that there are only three reviews of this place. It's a great local cafe that serves up high-quality sandwiches, soups, salads, and baked goods, and from how packed it is during lunchtime, it's clear that other people agree with me.   For only $6.75, you can get a half of any sandwich, a soup or salad, chips, and a mini cookie. I tried out this lunch combo, selecting the Asparagus and Havarti sandwich (with ham added) and the Harvest Salad. The salad was decent, although I must say I'm getting a little tired of the candied walnut, dried fruit, blue cheese combination - it was inventive and delicious a few years ago, but now, it just seems standard.   The real standout was definitely the sandwich. The Havarti cheese and asparagus complimented each other really well, and the artisan bread was crusty and delicious. I definitely could have gone without the ham because the sandwich was flavorful without it.   The staff was also very friendly, and the food came out relatively quickly given how busy the place was during the lunch rush. This place is only a 2-minute drive from my office, and I will definitely be back!

You can definitely tell as soon as you walk up to Switch that it is part of the FEZ-Ticoz family. The decor is bright, modern, and colorful, a style of atmosphere that always makes me feel comnfortable and excited about the food even before I try it. I met Kym S. here for lunch and wasn't feeling so hot the morning after a pretty long night out on the town. Before long (thanks to some great company and satisfying food), I was feeling a lot better!  Kym S. ordered the Sangria Chicken sandwich, which came with a side Caesar. It looked great and was massive, but I'll let her comment on how good it was. I was craving something really filling, so I got the Gallette (pronounced Gah-let according to our server) with Beef and Mushrooms ($10.45 plus $1.95 to add a field greens salad), and it was fantastic. I think I was expecting something like a meat pie, which it was not, but I was happy with what it actually was - a thin layer of puff pastry topped with savory beef slices, mushrooms, and a creamy gouda sauce. It REALLY hit the spot. The field greens salad was good, although it was soaked in dressing, which kind of drowned out the flavor of the fresh greens.   The service was definitely a highlight of the experience. Our server was very attentive and kept checking back with us. He also brought carafes of water and diet coke over, which is a brilliant business move on my part. It streamlines and facilitates service because people aren't constantly asking for refills, and both the servers and customers end up happier. The Diet Coke I ordered was a bit on the pricey side (around $2.75), but I was ok with this given the fact that I had a carafe to refill from.   This is a really nice spot to meet a friend for lunch, and I will definitely be back. I also think it would make a great place for a casual, low-key happy hour - from their website, it looks like they have drink specials from 4-6:30 (2-4-1 caipirinhas, margaritas, and sangria).

It's hard to believe it's been almost four years since I wrote my first review of Switch. Since then, I've probably been to Switch 25+ times, largely because I now live a few blocks away but also because it's a consistently reliable place for a meal, drinks or both.   Some of my Switch favorites:  *The Mozzarella and Chop Salads - unlike some other local restaurants that will go unnamed, Switch's salads aren't all overly sweet (I am so sick of strawberries and candied walnuts!). These two, in particular, are hearty but still have feel light and fresh. Even the salad that does have the fresh fruit and candied nuts (the House) does a little differently, with fresh blackberries and raspberries and delicious fried onion straws.  *The two seafood appetizers (Lobster/Crab Puffs and the Sesame Shrimp) - the first is rich and really satisfying with a light drink and the shrimp are very fresh and flavorful with an Asian kick.  *The veggie burger - so delicious. We were surprised to find out the veggie burger wasn't made in house because it certainly tastes like it is. It's very filling and doesn't fall apart like most, but still isn't overly formed or artificial.  *Amsterdam Pasta - this is a little heavier than I normally order, but they do a great job making the sauce creamy without overwhelming. Extra points for the truffle oil :) *Cheap-ass brunch carafes - while the size of the carafes has reduced in the past few months, you still can't beat $3 Bloody Mary carafes (serve about 3) and $6 mimosa carafes. How many lazy Sunday afternoons have I spent downing 2 (or 3) of these delicious concoctions.   Some of the improvable aspects of the experience:  *The brunch service experience - while I understand it must be frustrating to serve super cheap carafes, they're on the menu and people are there at your restaurant, instead of somewhere else in CenPho with almost-as-cheap drinks. So suck it up and don't act like I'm some cheapo or that I can't make a request simply because I'm paying a small amount for booze. Last time I went, I asked for a glass with a salted rim with my Bloody Mary carafe and was refused. Another time, my friend asked for pineapple juice in the Cape Cod carafe and got a lot of attitude about "changing something that's already cheap." Even if he were charged extra (which is fine), the server could have just said that and made the whole thing a lot less awkward.  *The overly-sweet specialty drinks - most of their daily drink specials are really sugary, with tons of grenadine and syrups. I wouldn't mind seeing just a good old vodka soda every now and then.  *The martinis - I've ordered a dirty martini a few times there and I never will again. Must be the olive juice?  *The brunch food menu - It's quite small and has few vegetarian options. Could definitely be expanded.   I definitely won't stop going to Switch, especially since it's so close, and I've had so many great experiences there, but I'd like to see them invest a little time in fixing some of the cons.

My husband and I came here last summer when we were thinking of moving to Phoenix. We arrived just as the sun was setting and were literally blown away by the natural beauty of the location. We had the two martinis that apparently are the favorites - the Cantaloupe Martini and the Grapefruit and Basil Martini - and they were just as amazing as everyone says. We didn't try any appetizers, but we did have a fabulous peanut butter and chocolate dessert. The service was attentive, and we would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to take in desert scenery at its best.

I've been back to Jade Bar two or three times since I wrote this review, and while I still adore the view and specialty cocktails, the service has definitely gone down a notch (or a Yelp star).   When there with a group of seven, we waited 20-30 minutes between drink order and drink delivery and even longer to give (and get) our small appetizer order, which was missing an item when it finally arrived. More recently, when I was there with just one other person (and it was not crowded at all), we kept having to flag down our server to get things and again, waited a long time to get our drinks.   On a positive note, the place is still absolutely gorgeous and their new food menu (rolled out in the past 2 weeks) is awesome. The escargot/mushroom dumplings I tried were divine, and I loved the light peanut sauce on them. Plus, according to our server, they will be rolling out a happy hour food shortly. That will definitely be worth coming back for. Just leave some extra time!

3rd update here. This place is still fantastic and still one of the poshest happy hours in the Phoenix area. They have reduced their HH menu a little bit and some of the better cocktails aren't included but you can't beat $5-$6 for inventive drinks and the food items are always very generous for the money.   One thing that I wanted to tell my fellow Yelpers: they are going to be closing for the summer for renovations. They will be expanding the Jade space, including the outdoor patio. It will be hard to live without Jade Bar for the summer but I have a feeling the redo will be well worth the wait - and will perhaps warrant a fourth update.

It's possible that all of my  recent abysmal experiences at downtown "hotspots" (see my reviews of Networks and Majerle's) are making me rate ICON much higher than I otherwise would, but in the spirit of promoting downtown development and praising businesses that are actually making an effort to be a place where you might want to hang out, I'm going to give the spot four very enthusiastic thumbs-up.   Located directly across from what is now Hanny's, ICON occupies the south side of the Wyndham and spills out into a small but cozy patio. As you can see from the pictures I've uploaded to this listing, the space is modern and hip without being too cold or uninviting. Yes, you can still see the lobby for the actual bar and from many of the inside tables, but the space is definitely an improvement over the cookie-cutter and outdated look of many hotel bars.   We visited ICON on Saturday night around 7:30pm. The place was virtually empty, although I blame this less on a particular flaw of ICON and more on what appears to be the chronic unpopularity of downtown Phoenix. We decided to take a seat outside and have an appetizer and a drink. Our server, Zane, was really polite and took our order pretty much immediately, which may not seem like a big deal since there were so few other patrons. However, having been a server for three years, I can tell you that it's often the times when a restaurant is the most empty when the servers will slack off the most. Kudos to Zane for still being on top of it.   The food section of the menu was divided into "Nibbles" and "Bites," both essentially categories of small plates/tapas. There was also a small selection of artisanal cheeses, as well as a sampling of desserts. The distinction between the "Nibbles" and "Bites" (words that seem more inappropriate to me each time I repeat them!) was not entirely clear since some of the plates in the "Nibbles" section seemed just as substantial as the "BItes"; for example, we ordered the fried calamari with flash-fried spinach from the "Nibbles" section, and even though it wasn't large, it was a decent-sized plate to share before going to dinner. It's entirely possible that the "Bites" are larger portions, which I'll have to report back on next time we go.   In terms of flavor, we found the calamari to be perfectly fried and not too chewy. The flash-fried spinach was a bit greasy, but we loved the unique crispy texture and thought it tasted delicious with a squeeze of lemon. There were some other dishes that sounded great--the pork belly sliders and lamb ribs sounded especially worth trying--and none was more than $10 or so, which is pretty reasonable as far as small plates go. I've been places that charged $12 or more for a much smaller small plate!  The specialty drink menu was about 10-15 drinks long, and just like the small plates list, was filled with interesting and creative options. I opted for the classic lemon drop, which was "twisted" due to the addition of Grand Marnier. I thought it was refreshing without being too sweet. My husband's Ketel One martini was very-well mixed, with his request for "lightly dirty" being perfectly executed. However, the olives it came with were gross and were in sore need of an upgrade. Both drinks were around $9, which is expensive compared to a dive bar but not for a nicer lounge in a hotel.   I think ICON stands out compared to a lot of other places downtown. Effort has been paid to its decor, food, and drinks, and that means something in an area of the city that is struggling to attract attention and make a name for itself. Hopefully, as Hanny's grows in popularity, ICON will get more drop-ins who realize that it's a decent spot for a beverage and--dare I say--a nibble. I personally plan to return at some point very soon, perhaps in combination with a drink and food item at Hanny's, which I am very interested in trying.

I can't speak to Blush as a club because my experience there was limited to experiencing the place as an early-evening lounge. When I walked in around 9pm on a Saturday with my group of friends, I could barely focus on the decor because I was too shocked by how empty the place was. In that sense, it would have been fun to stick around the whole night just to watch the place transform! When I did actually take a look at the decor, I was impressed and especially liked the multi-colored and unusually-shaped lanterns covering the ceiling. The pink floor was striking but a bit '80s looking.   We ended up sitting outside on the patio for a drink or two and I really enjoyed that area. It wasn't too fancy (in fact, the neutral brown and camel color palette was a nice change from the very feminine interior, although I wonder if they just didn't renovate the patio that existed when this place was Lure) and felt more like the outdoor area of a trendy bar. Our drinks were sufficiently strong and priced as expected for Vegas. As Melissa H and Kristin S emphasized, it was also nice to not pay a cover.   This was a great spot to stop by on the earlier side of our night out on the town. If I returned at a similar time of night, I'd definitely sit out on the patio and enjoy a drink or two over sitting in the empty inside area. After all, clubs really only feel like clubs if they're packed with sweaty people!

Gay bar or not, this place is awesome! It pretty much fits all of my criteria for a perfect bar:   Clean, good/affordable drinks, private patio, friendly staff, respectful patrons, has karaoke, makes it easy to get a cab home.   We went on a Tuesday night first and foremost to sing karaoke (we had been at Durant's for dinner and found this to be a pretty doable walk from there) but ended up having an even better time than expected. There was a whole list of specialty martinis that are only $5 (all the time!) - we tried the Espresso Martini, Lemon Drop, Black Cherry Cosmo, and all of them were delicious! They were also featuring $2.50 well drinks during karaoke. The bartender was so nice; after pouring our specialty martinis, she even gave us the shakers so we could refill! I *love* when places do that!   The karaoke crowd did feature some serious singers, which was nice for us, because karaoke is pretty much the only time we sing these days (we sang together in college), but there were also people just looking to entertain the crowd and have a great time. A really good mix, all told (not too die-hard serious or too sloppy). The KJ himself was also good and kept things moving along nicely. The only negative was that the sound system wasn't great - what Nadia C thought was them fading her out was probably just the sound system being funky because it did that for most of the night.   When we finally decided to head out and asked the bartender to call us a cab, she was super nice about it, and the cab was there within 5 minutes. Bonus points for Kobalt for making it easy for people to get home safely - a lot of karaoke bars we've been to in the past made us wait so long for a cab that we were exhausted and a little bit irritable by the time we left.   All in all, this is a great spot and definitely worth checking out if you love karaoke and want to sing in a really clean, brightly decorated, and friendly environment.

Ugh. We absolutely hated our experience here. When we first arrived, the host (who was standing outside at a stand) called us "sir" and "madam," which I thought was a little peculiar but not in and of itself annoying. Little did I know that ~32 minutes later, we'd look back and think of his misplaced etiquette as the only positive thing about our dining experience at Dragonfly. The service was totally unimpressive, especially given that the restaurant wasn't at all crowded, and the $4 happy-hour-special Long Islands were more sour mix than alcohol, but what really turned us off was the overly sweet, sugary, and poorly-thought-out food.   We started with the "Mill Avenue" appetizer sampler. The only real standout was the cream-cheese filled puffs (ironically, the least authentic item) - the other items, including the sauce, were just off. The spare ribs were dry, the paper wrapped around the spring rolls was tough (telltale sign that they hadn't been freshly made), and the sauces were watery and had no zest at all. We eagerly looked forward to our entrees but when they came and we tried them, we found ourselves wishing for the flavorless and subpar - but not disgusting - appetizers. My husband had the mango beef - I used to work at a Vietnamese fusion restaurant where this was featured on the menu, and there, it consisted of thinly sliced beef with tender pieces of mango and a oyster sauce. Here, it was fatty chunks of beef with underripe mango in a sickeningly sweet, sticky sauce mixed up with a bunch of unrelated "sauteed" veggies. My yellow curry chicken and shrimp tasted less like a complex curry and more like a meat and veggie mixture (think bad Chinese) tossed in a paper bag with a whole jar of curry powder.   When the waiter came to clear our almost-full plates, he asked if everything was ok. Our philosophy is usually to say something in response to that question only if something is fixable (e.g., a meat can be redone to be less well-done). In this case, the whole restaurant concept seems to be centered on serving flavorless and poor-quality large portions to a university crowd they seem to think is un-discerning. With so much wrong, a complete overhaul would be necessary. And, so...we said "We're just full. Thanks!" and got the hell out of there!

Growing up, one of my favorite movies was the animated version of Charlotte's Web. One of my favorite scenes from the film is when the rat, Templeton, goes around the fair at night, collecting left-over food scraps and garbage. He eats everything in sight, singing all the while about the fair being a "smorgasbord, orgasbord, orgasbord." At the end of the night, he returns to the pen where Wilbur is being kept, proclaiming "What a night! Never have I seen such leavings! Everything well ripened, seasoned with the passage of time and the heat of the day. Oh, it was rich, my friends. Rich!"  Well, there's no better way to describe the way I felt when I returned home from the State Fair on Friday night. I was disgustingly full of the greasiest food on Earth but incredibly satisfied at the same time. Like Templeton, my husband and I (and fellow fair-going companions) really partook in the "smorgasbord" - we consumed a corn dog, fried gator on a stick, mini donuts, funnel cake, bratwurst, and a massive turkey leg (which was delicious, by the way!). It was like Thanksgiving dinner, but less nutritionally complete. Of course, we also had some alcoholic beverages - the drinks we tried were all very expensive ($8.50 for beer and up to $12 for a mixed drink) but we were pleasantly surprised by how strong they were. No watered-down drinks for this crowd of fair-goers!   Another totally hedonistic experience at the state fair was the fabulous (and totally free!) Old School Jam concert. We rocked out to Coolio, Club Noveau, Climax, and Naughty by Nature (Ton-Loc was too cool for (old) school and skipped out). Maybe they weren't as good as back in the day, but we all had so much fun re-living the good old days and dancing off all of that ridiculously caloric food! The only less-than-fun part of the whole concert was the grumpy people behind us who told us to sit down (have they ever been to a concert?!), but their bad attitude was the only downer of the whole experience.   If you haven't been to the state fair yet AND you like eating lots of junky food in a no-frills environment, I recommend you check it out. You have until November 2, 2008 to do so. I believe you can still see Meatloaf and LL Cool J if you are interested in a concert. To save money on parking, park in the Capitol building lot (northeast corner of 19th Ave and Jefferson) and take the free shuttle (runs every fifteen minutes). Just don't have too much fun  or you might almost miss the last shuttle like we did!

Sometimes, whether or not you enjoy a bar depends heavily on the night's circumstances. In the case of last Saturday, during the downtown pub crawl, it was a relief to walk into a place that: 1) was happening (at least relative to other spots downtown); 2) actually offered something special for the pub crawl (no cover charge and $1 beer); and 3) had great music playing. I walked in feeling down and perked right up!   That being said, Silver is definitely not a wine bar. I'm not even sure it's a martini bar. It also only has two single restrooms. There is also very limited seating. Regardless, it was alive when the rest of downtown was dead, and for that, I give it major props.   If I ever return in a different mood or with higher expectations, I will definitely update.

I've only been living in the Phoenix area for 6+ months, and I'm already about as tired of conversations about whether a particular spot is too "Scottsdale" or not as I am about whether Starbucks sucks. I can see why people boycott Scottsdale (and Starbucks) entirely, but I'm still surprised when people go somewhere in Scottsdale and then complain that it's too "douchey" or has too much "hype." I mean, what do you expect in a hotel with red velvet ropes outside a bar and chairs so stylish you can't sit in them--a freakin' Cheers?   Besides, the "douchiness" is sort of why you come to a place like Red Bar, right? In college, my friends and I used to love to go see badly-scripted and terribly-acted movies ("40 Days and 40 Nights" comes to mind), put some vodka in our cherry Icees, and laugh--of course, not because the movie was actually well-produced, but because the bad jokes were funny in that bad-joke kind of way.   Red Bar was sort of like those bad movies we used to go see. Yes, there was silicone housed in Forever 21 tops. Yes, there were guys with their collars popped. Yes, there was ridiculous dancing on top of tufted ottomans in a rich shade of--you guessed it--red.  And, yes, the drinks were expensive. But with those expensive drinks in my system and an open mind, all the other things were funny. And enjoyable in their own Scottsdale-like way. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go drink a grande nonfat latte with sugar free Cinnamon Dolce syrup.

I'm working downtown now (new themed list to come soon!) so I'm exploring the area from a different angle. I'm no stranger to downtown/midtown's happy hour and dinner spots, but I've never had to go out and search for breakfast or lunch during the day.   I checked out Focaccia one morning when I hadn't had breakfast yet at the recommendation of my husband, Myles M, who works right around the corner. He said I should order the breakfast burrito, so I did, because he's pushy and I always do what I'm told. Ok, neither of things are true, but in this case, he had conviction and I obediently complied.   The breakfast burrito was worth every penny. Being a somewhat recent convert to pescetarianism, I got it with egg whites (cool that they had that option), spinach, green salsa and potatoes. The woman behind the counter made it up right there on the grill and it was warm and delicious. The potatoes were skin-on which gave them a great texture and flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick.   The hot coffee from the carafe I got to accompany it was airplane-quality, but next time, I'll just grab something from Cartel on the way back to my office. God knows the burrito alone will be enough to keep me coming back to Focaccia.

This down-home pub/restaurant is located in downtown Phoenix's Heritage Square (a little area that preserves some of Phoenix's Victorian past) in a converted house. It's located directly across from the infamous Pizzeria Bianco, which is either a blessing or a curse, depending on how you look at it. On the particular night we went thinking we might want to wait in line at Pizzeria Bianco but ultimately deciding we were too hungry to stick it out - in that sense, Rose & Crown won (and greatly benefited from its location across from PB). It lured us away from the best pizza ever, convincing us to sit on its Southern-style patio and chow down on average-tasting roast beef sliders and half-priced vodka sodas. That being said, we really enjoyed ourselves. There was something really homey and relaxing about sitting on the patio (we didn't even go inside), sipping on cold drinks, and looking around at all the Victorian homes. The service was friendly (although it was a bit slow at times), and we definitely would have stayed a lot longer had it not been 110 outside!

I'm a coffee girl. I've never really enjoyed the taste of tea and will only really seek it out if I have a sore threat. Needless to say, you won't find me driving 15-20 miles to Chandler just to have a cup of tea. However, Urban Tea Loft is much more than just tea--it's a stylish and warm gathering place inspired by tea but also featuring a full menu, friendly staff, and a full bar (with tea-infused spirits). While I still probably wouldn't make the drive to downtown Chandler just to go there, I would definitely stop in again if I were in the area.   I first encountered this spot when Myles M and I met Jim W and Audrey W to try Latitude Eight (which is right around the corner on Arizona Avenue). After we finished our so-so lunch there (review to come shortly), we decided to pop into Urban Tea Loft to check it out. Even though I don't love tea, I was way too full to have any sweets (and coffee was naturally not on the menu!), so the four of us decided to share a pot of tea. Again, nothing about the tea really jumped out at me, but the service was incredibly friendly and I loved the hip feeling of the space. If I'm in the area again, I would definitely be interested in trying an appetizer and one of their tea-infused martinis!

I wish this place were better but it ain't. One late night stop for drinks/dinner and a happy hour celebrating the premiere of SATC 2 were all that it took. I love the bar area setup and think the place has a lot of potential, but the food and drinks just aren't good enough to make the cut.   The seafood pasta was totally overpriced and a bit fishy. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was covered in some overly sweet tomato sauce. My Cosmo (in honor of the movie, of course) was super saccharin with just a hint of vodka. I know you're doing a special promotion, but why not use that opportunity to impress potential customers? Also, the service was less than impressive and a bit curt.   I say pass. If you want inoffensive bar food, try Coach and Willie's or Majerle's instead.

I know that there has been a lot of controversy surrounding Fresh and Easy and whether it's really as "Fresh and Easy," environmentally friendly, or as organic as it bills itself to be. I'll leave that whole discussion for the talk threads and just focus on why, from a shopping and eating perspective, I absolutely love this market. First of all, because my husband and I love food so much, we tend to eat out and crave restaurant dining more than we should to be friendly on the wallets and our waistlines. Because Fresh and Easy has such a variety of good-quality frozen and pre-prepared options that can easily be combined to create a meal, I'm a lot happier eating at home and the total price is much less than we would pay going out. As an example, we combined their refrigerated vegetable samosas ($3.99) with their frozen paneer meal ($3.99; also comes with rice and green beans) and some naan ($3.99) and had a delicious, easy Indian meal for about $6/person. The other thing I love about this place is how, unlike at Trader Joe's, certain gourmet or more exotic ingredients are staples, and not special buys for a specified time period.  Before moving to Phoenix, my husband and I made Trader Joe's our gourmet market of choice, but would get very frustrated if we went there to get dinner supplies and found everything but basil and fresh thyme and had to make another stop. At Fresh and Easy, however, things like creme fraiche, Thai garlic & chili sauce, and herbs stay in stock so you can do all of your shopping for a recipe in one place. And then, there's just the deliciousness factor - many things I've randomly tried - red pepper hummus, pre-prepared flan, espresso fudge ice cream, and fresh grapefruit juice - have just been that - delicious. It's wonderful to feel that grocery shopping can tantalize you just as much as trying a new restaurant. Of course, I don't think that F&E would be as wonderful if it weren't right on 19th Ave. and Baseline, four minutes from my house. And I still LOVE Whole Foods. But I find F&E much more exciting and enjoyable of a shopping experience than a regular market or Trader Joe's.

I really liked this place! I'm always looking for a lunch option that's not sit-down but isn't just a sandwich shop or fast-food joint. Extreme Pita definitely fills that void. First of all, the people working there were super-friendly and helpful. Second, the food we ordered was really good and satisfying! I ordered the Falafel Fanatic (pita filled with hummus, veggies, and hot sauce). My husband got the Gyro. I believe both sandwiches ran around $8 (including a drink and chips). The falafel was a little dry, but the flavor was right-on, and the hot sauce added the perfect kick to the milder falafel and hummus. The grilled veggies also tasted fresh. The meat in my husband's choice was also good-quality, and the pita was moist but not too doughy. As an added bonus, both pitas were huge - lots of value but also flavor for your lunch money. Can't beat that!

After visiting this store for the first time, I decided that my husband's and my decorating motto should be: "Eurway style on an IKEA budget." This place is filled with beautiful, high-quality modern furniture and accessories that are less mass-produced and more unique than Ikea that were too expensive for our budget - at least when we were trying to furnish multiple rooms and not just add a funky piece to one space. As an example, a really nice, dark wood dining set ran about $400 for the table and $150 for each chair, whereas the Ikea set for 8 we ended up purchasing cost about $500 total. While these prices are much more reasonable than a place like EQ3, they are definitely higher than some people looking for a lot of furniture (and not just a few pieces) might be willing (or able) to pay.   We did end up purchasing one thing, however. It was a beautiful eat-in table with funky aluminum legs and a glass table top - you could choose from 3 different sizes of tops. I believe the table ran about $250, but it looks really sleek. In the end, we still decided to go to Ikea to get the chairs (paid $100 instead of $300), but I am still glad we walked away with one upgraded piece! Don't get me wrong - I have nothing against Ikea. I love being able to add simple but clean-lined decor to my house at very affordable prices. But it's nice to differentiate now and then, and if you have a bit more to spend on a lot of furniture or are looking for a piece that's unique, I would highly recommend Eurway.

I just wasn't impressed with this place. My lack of enthusiasm has little to do with being narrow-minded about food or being unable to appreciate small/local businesses. I point this out because it seems like a lot of other reviewers think that anyone who doesn't like this place (or the owner) is an unsophisticated country bumpkin or a chain restaurant freak. Well, I like to think I have a pretty open mind when it comes to food and the ability to differentiate between food that is well prepared and food that falls a little short. On top of that, I love supporting local businesses that bring something new to the table. Given all this, I really wanted to  like La Piccola Cucina, but was surprised (and a bit disappointed) when it didn't turn out to be everything I had hoped for.   I tried this place a few weeks ago with the lovely Kristin S as my lunch date. The historic house was certainly adorable and the patio a wonderful spot to eat al fresco. Also,  the young man who took our orders was really polite and helpful, but the food was just not very good. I'm a big fan of the "tavola calda" (hot food served buffet style with a focus on protein and sides) model and ate at many such places in Italy, but the "hot table" at La Piccola Cucina was not so "hot." My rotisserie style chicken was incredibly dry. The skin was also overcooked and a bit flavorless.  I also tried a piece of Kristin's chicken breast and found it to be dry. The eggplant side was flavorful but so oily I felt a little queasy after eating it. The roasted zucchini side was cooked to the right texture but had a strange, almost sour, flavor to it.   At a certain point in our meal, the owner came by the table and asked how we were doing. He noticed I hadn't eaten much of the chicken and asked if everything was ok. I said that I wanted to be honest and that I had found my chicken to be dry. He apologized in a way that wasn't all that apologetic and asked me if I wanted another piece of the same chicken. Confused by the offer, I declined and just said we'd come close out our tab. He didn't say anything else.   I was definitely disappointed in the food, but I was even more disappointed that the owner didn't truly seem concerned that I had had a sub-par meal. If your food is incredible, then feel free to cop the "only an imbecile could dislike this" attitude. Otherwise, remain open to feedback and constantly strive to deliver a consistently good product. In my humble opinion, that's what makes for a good local restaurant that sticks around in the hard times.   I'd be open to coming back here and trying a sandwich at some point, but jumping out my seat to go back here, I am not.

I don't know why, but I've always had the biggest problem getting my car washed on a regular basis. Even all the dust here in Phoenix hasn't inspired me to make the car wash a regular stop. Ok, if I'm going to be perfectly honest, my trip to Snappy Auto Spa last week was only the second time I've gone to get my trusty vehicle washed in the nine months I've lived here in Phoenix.   Needless to say, my laziness in terms of actually going to get my car washed extends to my laziness in terms of actually washing it. While there are multiple places closer to my house to get a self-service wash, I specifically selected Snappy Auto Spa because I had seen a sign a few weeks prior that said that they now offer a full-service option.   When I arrived at Snappy Auto Spa, I pulled up to the little check-in kiosk, where a guy was waiting to help me select which option I wanted (I chose the basic wash ($5) plus the third-level (of 4) full-service packages (I believe it was $12 or so). I pulled up to the track where the wash begins (you know, the part where you put the car in neutral and lower your antenna). The guy standing there to give these instructions the wash wasn't exactly helpful when I struggled a bit to line my wheels up with the moving track (I don't think he spoke a word of English), but to be fair to him, I'm not exactly a pro at getting my car washed!  After going through the wash, I pulled up to the full-service station, where several guys started vacuuming my seats, polishing the exterior, etc. I sat on a bench in the sun and waited for them to be done thinking to myself that this whole experience wasn't really that bad! After about ten minutes, the guys called me over and gave me back my keys. I tipped them for a job well done and headed out of the parking lot. About 10 seconds later, I went to turn the radio on and realized that the front of the volume dial was missing! I screeched to a halt, put the car in reverse and went back to the full-service station.   I won't bore you with every detail of what happened in the next 45 minutes, but to make a long story short, it turns out that they somehow vacuumed up the little plastic piece. 2 of the guys who had been working on the car gave me attitude about looking for the piece and refused to take some amount of responsibility for the fact that they had damaged part of my car, telling me that they could have the manager (who wasn't supposed to be there until 2 hours later) call me.   However, I must say that I was very impressed by the way one of the guys didn't follow the others' leads, instead telling me that he would "make it right." He  insisted on getting the manager there, having her open up the vacuum and digging through God-knows-what to find the piece.   As much as his commitment to customer service impressed me, though, I can't give Snappy more than two stars. After all, if you rewind to the beginning of this review, I told you--my trusty Yelper--that I HATE going to the car wash. I find it time-consuming and painless enough without having to spend an extra 3/4 of an hour at the damn place waiting for someone to fish a piece of my car dial out of the vacuum.   Life is too short to waste time at a non-Snappy car wash. Next time, I'll drive a little farther to find somewhere else or go somewhere self-service. After all, one of my favorite sayings is "You want something right, you do it yourself."

Thank you, Kristin S, for inviting me along to happy hour at Maizie's (4-6 on weekdays). I met her, Melissa H, and Melissa H (no, that's not a typo--there are two Melissa Hs active on Phoenix Yelp!) there on a cool Thursday evening. I'm not sure what I expected from Maizie's (from the website, it looked more like a Cheuvront), but I was certainly pleased with what it ended up being: a comfortable spot to relax and unwind with friends. Less like a wine bar, more like a neighborhood bistro.   The decor is simple and cozy with stained concrete floors, light wood tables, some curved leather seating, and an impressive modern wine rack. We ended up sitting at a corner table (with a nice view of Central Avenue). Our server was really friendly, although maybe a little overly attentive. He asked if we were doing OK probably ever four or five minutes or so! At least if I return, I can be guaranteed to get what I need when I need it!  I actually had my kickboxing class later that night, so I decided not have any wine (a big deal for me if you know me at all!), but I was pleased to find that they offered sugar free Red Bull and ordered one of those. My happy hour companions got wine by the glass, which was $2 off. We also split 3 appetizers (all 50% off during happy hour): tortilla chips with black bean salsa and guacamole, the spinach artichoke dip, and the pesto bruschetta. I found the pesto sauce on the bruschetta to be overly salty and the salsa a little bland, but the spinach artichoke dip was really good and satisfying on a cooler night.   I have a feeling that I wouldn't enjoy Maizie's for a full dinner, since the  food I tried was a bit typical and not particularly inventive. That being said, though, it's an excellent spot for a satisfying happy hour, and I wouldn't hesitate for a second to order appetizers and drinks here at discounted prices. I could also see my husband and I lingering here past happy hour enjoying a bottle of wine and some dessert.   As a side note, be sure to check out the Events section of their website: http://maiziescafe.com/events.htm. It looks like they have some fun stuff going on, including the upcoming prix fixe New Year's Eve dinner and "Travel to Italy" Tuesdays in December. It also seems that you can purchase wine and beer to go at discounted prices, which would be nice if you live close by and want to pick something up for a night at home.

Italian was my unofficial and official second major in college. I studied in Rome for three months and Florence for three months and went back several times after to experience the magic all over again. While I was there, I learned many things about Italian culture and solidified my language skills, but as you can imagine, the thing that I found the most exciting and educational was the Italians' relationship with food.    Regardless of the region I was in, I found Italians united by shared beliefs about food preparation and eating, many of which were foreign to me prior to going. As an example, all the Italians I met took it as a given that: salad comes after a meal, not before it; fresh fruit is a dessert, not a snack or breakfast; alfredo sauce and mozzarella sticks are not Italian; alcohol exists to enhance the flavors of food, not to get drunk; and pepperoni is not thin slices of cured pork, but peppers - you know, the vegetables (this one blew my mind the most!).   You get the idea. Of course, these guidelines come across to Americans as strict rules. We love our culinary freedom, and that makes sense - we have many different types of food, types of people, and types of lifestyles. Plus, Italian food changed a lot at the hands of the immigrants who came here. However, even if I'm not going to follow every guideline, I took from my experiences in Italy a sense of genuine appreciation for simple, fresh flavors, a desire to slow down and truly enjoy what I'm eating, and a greater awareness of the way that different dietary components come together to create a balanced diet and better internal functioning.  Since I got back, I've found few Italian restaurants that really embody these key principles, refusing to dumb down or speed up their food for the American masses. Well, Pizza A Metro is part of that elite category, and I'm thrilled to have found it here in Phoenix, just a short drive from our house. Maurizio makes it his goal to serve his customers fresh, simple, carefully-prepared food that allows the flavors of individual ingredients to shine. I appreciate that so much.   We checked the place out for the first time last Friday night. We had made a reservation in advance, which was a great idea because we only had to wait 2-3 minutes to be seated once we arrived. We were promptly greeted by Maurizio and quickly had our drink order taken by the server. I was a little nervous about speaking Italian, since I'm pretty rusty, but I figured I should, since I haven't got many chances to do so in California, where I grew up, or here in Phoenix. So, when Maurizio returned with our bread basket and to take our order, I worked up my courage and ordered in Italian. Even though he was super-busy, Maurizio asked me a few questions back in Italian (where did I study, etc.) and continued to converse with us in Italian throughout the rest of the meal. It was so much fun for me to speak again, especially when the food was so delicious and really took me back to my study abroad time.   We decided to start with the grilled calamari and then have the Penne Amatriciana and a medium Pizza Frescolina. The bread basket was phenomenal, with lightly oiled pieces of Italian flatbread with a cold mixture of eggplant, olives, and onions (almost like an Italian ratatouille). When the calamari arrived, we discovered that it was fried and not grilled (both are appetizer options; grilled is more prominent in Italy), but we decided not to say anything and eat it anyway. We were glad we did because it reminded me of the seafood "fritti misti" you get in Italy - just lightly battered with a hint of seasoning. It came with a tomato sauce, but it was delicious with just a squeeze of lemon.   Our entrees were even more delicious. My pasta could have been a bit more al dente, probably because most Americans don't eat it that way, but no harm done - I'll just order it that way next time. The sauce was incredible and truly authentic. It perfectly combined fresh tomatoes, tender pieces of pancetta, onion, garlic, and olive oil without being too thick or sweet. The pizza was also to die-for with a thin, flour-brushed crust, small amounts of milky mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and arugula, and salty prosciutto. Just like Italian pies, all the flavors were balanced and no single one was overwhelming. So you know, the medium was huge and even with our huge appetite we ended up taking 3-4 slices home.  All in all, we only spent $30 or so and had an amazing, deeply satisfying meal that brought me back to my memorable time in Italy. I absolutely can't wait to go back and try more things (and practice my Italian again!).

Like many other reviewers, I know Sweet Republic's owners (fellow Yelper, Helen Y. and Jan). Knowing them may have been what made my husband (Myles M) and me drive all the way up from South Phoenix to North Scottsdale, but knowing them would not make me give them an unwarranted 5-star rating. I have high standards for my food and drink, so I can guarantee you that my 5-star rating of Sweet Republic's is 100% genuine.   Good cuisine always places a huge focus on two things: 1) using fresh, high-quality ingredients; and 2) combining these ingredients in a simple, thoughtful way that maximizes the individual flavors (think "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"). Based on this definition, Sweet Republic makes great food that just happens to be ice cream. All of the ice creams, sorbets, and yogurts use ultra-fresh and natural ingredients (e.g., fresh mint, locally-roasted espresso, wild desert honey, handmade marshmallows) and the flavors thoughtfully combine ingredients that really go well together (e.g., pear and ginger, basil and lime, blue cheese and dates, blueberry and orange).   Helen and Jan know what goes well together, too, and they will be happy to suggest flavor combinations of the different ice creams that work well together. When I started to order the Cheese Course flavor with Rocky Road, simply because those two flavors sounded the best to me, Jan suggested that I pair the Cheese Course with a fruit flavor. I took her advice, paired it with the Pear Ginger, and the cool, subtle sweetness of the pear and ginger flavors did wonders to cut the strong blue cheese flavor. I felt like I should have had a glass of wine to go with my cheese and fruit! My husband ended up ordering the Rocky Road with the Salted Caramel, which was by far my favorite flavor, and these two also paired wonderfully. We also had an opportunity to try the bacon ice cream, which was sweet and salty at the same time. If it sounds weird, just think of how great bacon tastes when it rubs up against your pancakes and gets maple syrup on it!   I always value an establishment's food and drink more than decor, presentation, etc., but in the case of Sweet Republic, the same attention and care paid to the sweets is also paid to the establishment's look, branding, and messaging, which only adds to the business' appeal. The shop is decorated in a bright, modern decor that manages not to look cookie-cutter in a sea of Ikea-decorated shops, the bathrooms are designed beautifully and are super clean, the menu is attractive and easy to read, and the website is well-written and contains all the pertinent information.   This is a great, local business whose owners care about making fresh, flavorful, and thoughtful ice creams and other desserts. I'm glad I met them and therefore had the incentive to go check it out. You should, too!

Lee's Blackbelt Academy has five locations throughout the valley. I discovered this one through a Google search; my husband and I decided that we wanted to enroll in a fitness class now that we are settled into the area. Obviously, the focus here is martial arts, but I discovered on their website that they offer "cardio kickboxing" and that we could come try the first class free. We went last Tuesday, and the class literally kicked our ass. Halfway through, our faces were bright red, my hair was really frizzy like it gets when I sweat, and we were both really out of breath. We didn't realize just how out of shape we were! Well, the good news is that once we pushed past the mid-point of the class, we were able to finish, even though we were truly exhausted and slept like babies that night. They were offering a promotion (1 individual signed up, the other gets 50% off) and the price is only $60 per person per month, which is reasonable. If you sign up, you can attend as many of the classes a month you want (they have a class once a day) at any of the academy's five locations. Not too bad! As an update/FYI, we went back for our second class last night. It was still hard, but it was much easier than the first time, and we feel like we're doing something really good for ourselves, or at least off-setting a little bit of the good food and drink we enjoy on a weekly basis!

So, it's been about three months since we first started going to Lee's for cardio kickboxing, and we are still really happy with the class. We go 2-3 times a week now and have noticed improvements in our stamina and strength. From a woman's perspective, it feels really good to get stronger while learning moves that could be employed in self-defense. I've always hated the gym, but I really enjoy going to this class.   Keep in mind that each instructor takes a different approach to the class and that not all classes feel the same in terms of intensity or style. I would just recommend trying a few different nights and seeing which instructor and style you prefer. Since the class schedule for this location has recently changed, I thought I'd go ahead and post it:  Mondays, 7:15 PM - 8:15 PM Tuesdays, 7:30 PM - 8:30 PM Wednesdays, 8:15 PM - 9:00 PM Thursdays, 8:15 PM - 9:00 PM Fridays, 7:00 PM - 8:00 PM Saturdays, 8:30 AM - 9:30 AM Sundays, 12 PM - 1 PM  As I mentioned in my previous review, do also note that Lee's has four other locations throughout the valley: Tempe, Phoenix West, Estrella Mountain, and Buckeye. If you're looking for a high-intensity but  engaging workout, I would check out this cardio kickboxing class at a location near you.

It's been well over a year since we started going to Lee's and I have to up my star rating to five. The people here have really become people we are excited to see, and it is largely their enthusiasm that makes us want to come back. Plus, despite the recession, they've kept their class prices really low. They've also added a 20-minute Warrior X-Fit class six times a week. Do note that the schedule has changed since my last update. Cardio kickboxing is now held:  Tuesdays at 7:30 pm Thursdays at 7:30 pm Saturdays at 8:30 am  Sundays at 10:30 am

I tend to forget about Middle Eastern food when I'm considering my dining options, but I have to thank Jason W - who invited me to try this little lunch spot in the Baiz Market - for reminding me of how satisfying and delicious (and in this case, affordable!) it can be.   I met him and some other Yelpers to sample some of Al-Hana's wares and while there were a few strike-outs (specifically, the hummus, which didn't have enough garlic or lemon, and the tabloulleh, which had way too much parsley), the falafel sandwich, shwarma beef and chicken sandwiches (both with garlic sauce), and cheese pies were all so flavorful! And at $2.99 and $3.99 for the sandwiches and $.50 - $3.99 for the other sides, the lunch was also incredibly affordable.   If you are ever in the area or work or live nearby, you should definitely check Al-Hana out. Given how affordable it is, you can have a savory and enjoyable lunch that really fills you up. If you have time after you finish eating, definitely take a few minutes to walk around the market - there are some real deals on Mediterranean staples, like 2-lb bags of dates for $3.99!   One final note - there is a $10 minimum for debit/credit card usage, so bring cash.

Maybe some of my surprise came from not having been to any new Burger Kings of late, but I was really surprised when my husband and I went in to this location yesterday morning (we had a craving for fast food breakfast) and saw that it was all decked out in a Hollywood theme. It had sleek colored booths, framed pictures of movie stars, and get this - pendant lighting! Granted, pendant lighting has become as ubiquitous in restaurants as jukeboxes used to be, but it's still strange that fast food franchises have even jumped on the decor bandwagon. Anyway, the people working at this location are super-friendly, although the staff does tend to be more motivated when a location is relatively new (this one is about a year old), and the food we got was to be expected. I do love BK's French Toast Sticks for a nutrition-less but delicious Saturday morning breakfast, and my husband's sausage muffin was good (although he ordered it with egg and cheese and didn't get them). To sum it up, this is a good location as far as Burger Kings go, but in the end, it's just Burger King, which is never really all that great.

After moving into our first home, my husband and I all of a sudden had a lot more need for stores like the Home Depot, Lowe's, and Ace than we ever did living in apartments. Even though we painted a few of the apartments we lived in, we never had to consider things like which air conditioning filters to buy, how to select the right length of extender for light fixtures, and which window coverings to buy. Having always seen commercials for the Home Depot and Lowe's that promise the customer how helpful their staff will buy in making these important and unfamiliar decisions (you know, "we can do it, you can help" and "let's build something together"), I guess we expected a staff that was a lot more proactive and helpful than the one we've encountered at this Lowe's. This Lowe's staff is definitely more helpful than the staff at the Home Depot in Laveen and their prices are more competitive, but we've been disappointed with how difficult it has been to get a staff member to help us (they definitely don't find you; you have to find them!) and to get questions answered. Every time my husband and I have gone in to select a product, we have found the staff to be somewhat absent (we have to had to track down someone to help us) and not all that knowledgeable about the difference between various products or the accessories/add-ons we needed for certain purchases.   I wouldn't recommend anyone against visiting this location of Lowe's, especially since their prices and selection are decent. However, I would advise new homeowners or those taking on big home improvement processes to do their homework online and with crafty friends or neighbors before coming in to shop because the bubbly, super-knowledgeable staff from the commercials appear to not actually exist in the real stores!

Before moving to Arizona, Walgreens and Long's were the closest pharmacies to my house. I appreciated Walgreens' cosmetics selection and online photo services but found the fact that they didn't sell alcohol (even wine or beer) and put their pregnancy tests in a closed case (who are they trying to protect by making women push a help button on the glass case to buy a test?) a bit disturbing. Long's had a full selection of alcohol and didn't seem to think it necessary to sequester their pregnancy tests, but had fairly high prices for common items. When we moved to Phoenix, we found that the closest pharmacy/drugstore was CVS, so we gave it a try and have been really happy with it so far. It has a great selection of everyday items, photo services, a full section of alcoholic beverages, easily accessible pregnancy tests, a friendly staff, and really competitive prices.   Best of all, it has a rewards program (called "Extra Care") that actually saves you money and earns you real rewards. With a few exceptions, everything you buy counts toward your quarterly spending and displays on your receipt (e.g., Summer quarter spending: $75). At the end of each quarter, you receive 2% cash back on all your quarterly spending in the form of a coupon (e.g., $6 Extra Care bucks) that you can apply to any future purchase. Certain products are also attached to Extra Care promotions, allowing you to earn additional Extra Care bucks. For example, they will have a promotion where your purchase of a certain type of toothpaste earns you $2 to spend later. As a member of many rewards programs (PetsMart's "Pet Perks," BevMo's "Club Bev," etc.) that only qualify you to get "special" pricing on items in the store and/or give you some *really* small coupon after you spend a s**tload of money, I was really grateful for a program that actually rewarded me for the things we buy every day. The only thing I have to be careful about is not buying things simply because they are on sale for Extra Care members; that's an easy trap to fall into!

The UPS Store is one of those places where I'm willing to go and pay a little more money for a service (in this case, packing and shipping items to be mailed) because it's just *that* much more convenient, hassle-free, and streamlined than the cheaper alternative (in this case, the illustrious U.S. Post Office). Sorry, Uncle Sam!  Pretty much every year in December, we go to the UPS Store to buy packing materials and ship all of our gifts to relatives and friends who live out of town. Even though Ground is not nearly as cost-effective as USPS' Priority Mail service, the friendliness of the employees, shorter lines, and packing services take a little edge off of the already-stressful holiday season.   This location is brand-new and definitely does not disappoint. The employees are really helpful and amiable and parking is a breeze. After visiting my parents in LA last weekend, I accidentally took my mom's extra set of house keys home with me (oops!). Instead of going to the closest post office (on 7th Street), which was nightmarish last time I went on a weekday afternoon, I just drove the few minutes to the UPS store, grabbed a quick-seal envelope, filled out the shipping form, paid, and was on my way 7-8 minutes later. No long lines, no hassle. Just quick and easy shipping. Totally worth the extra $4 I paid for the box and cost difference between Ground and Priority Mail.

This is a really good Starbucks location. Unlike a lot of the newer locations that have retro plastic chairs that look much more stylish than functional, it has lots of comfy upholstered chairs, plenty of plugs for web surfers, and a decently-sized outdoor seating area. The staff is really friendly and efficient as well. There is also a drive-through.

Sorry to anyone who likes this place, but The Keg is a big, fat disappointment - just like the parties with the same name always were back in college. To be fair, we only went for happy hour, but the specialty drink we tried and the appetizer we ordered were both really gross. In my opinion, a restaurant needs to make a good impression at the bar because a lot of people, myself included, try places out by ordering a drink and appetizer or two. Given how bad what we tried was, what incentive do we have for returning for a bigger meal?   From the outside, The Keg looks like your run-of-the-mill steakhouse; once we got inside, however, we were shocked at how sleek and upscale the decor was. The bathrooms, in particular, were gorgeous and super-clean. When we went to sit at the bar, we were expecting some really classic cocktails and satisfying appetizers. The happy hour drink special was an orange martini, so I thought I'd try it. My husband got a Heineken (1/2 off during happy hour), which can't be messed up.   To eat, we ordered the sliders, which were $9.95; they didn't have any happy hour food specials. The martini was really sweet and tasted like it didn't have a drop of alcohol in it; it kind of reminded me of Sunny-D, which I hated growing up and now wouldn't serve to children if you paid me. The sliders were even worse. They were supposed to be prime-rib sliders, but I would have rather had ground chuck. The meat was chewy and fatty and reminded us of the sausage in an Egg McMuffin (which I like but wasn't expecting on a slider). There were also no toppings like onion or tomato - just a sauce or piece of cheese on each one. Instead of fries on the side, there were just measly little fried onions. Blech. We could have gone to Ruby Tuesday's right next door and gotten better sliders!   In the end, we didn't spend more than $22 or so, but being a happy hour fanatic, I know that there are plenty of other places (Latitude 30 is a notable example) where we could go and spend the same amount and get some great appetizers and drinks. We definitely won't be back.

Things I love about Chipotle:  -The menu is simple, but you still have the option to vary it up by trying different combinations of ingredients, salsas, and preparations.  -The barbacoa beef and carnitas are super tender and flavorful.  -The chili-corn salsa gives everything a spicy kick and a satisfying crunch.  -They have margaritas, which I haven't tried because I see this place as more of a lunch spot but still seem nice to have as an option.  -The prices are relatively low given the overall quality and portion size. -The meat is humanely raised and the overall vibe of the restaurant communicates a sense of social awareness.   Things I don't love about Chipotle:  -The chicken is a little bit fatty and not as flavorful as the red meat and pork options, which is disappointing since I'm trying to limit my red meat consumption. -The peppers and onions that come when you get a fajita option are usually kind of soggy and flavorless.  -The vegetarian options aren't great, and it seems odd that they haven't introduced something more substantial (e.g., mushrooms or tofu) than peppers and onions for people who want to avoid meat.

Ever wonder what to do if you have lots of extra garbage or recyclables and either can't fit them all in your bins or missed bulk trash pickup day? Alternatively, are you looking for something just a little bit different to do on a lazy summer day?   Ok, ok, all kidding aside - you may find yourselves (as we did yesterday) with more broken-down boxes and odd-shaped trash (old floor lamps, etc.) than can fit in your bins. This waste facility allows Phoenix residents to dump bulk trash and recyclables for free once a month.   To get to the facility, drive down to 27th Avenue and Buckeye (aka "No Man's Land"). When you drive up, you will likely see a long line of commercial vehicles waiting to do their daily or weekly dump. You can bypass this line and go to the R (the sign says something like "Visitors"). When I say "you can," what I mean is that we did without being stopped, so you should be able to as well. According to the city website, we were supposed to have to show a driver's license and recent water bill to be let in, but no one stopped us or asked for proof of anything.   We drove around and around the facility, following signs that directed us to the visitors' drop-off area, until finally we arrived at a massive pile of garbage. Literally. There were tons of guys in pick-up trucks dumping yard clippings, as well as a few ordinary people, like us, who just wanted their garage to be less cluttered. Warning to the wise - the place stinks (it's filled with garbage, after all) and the ground is wet and a bit slippery. We wore flip-flops (how dumb were we?). If you go, you might want to wear a long-sleeved shirt and some old, crappy tennis shoes you don't give a crap about.   After dumping our trash, we looked around for the recycling drop-off. Some random employee sitting out under an umbrella told us that the bins were full and that we should just dump our massive pile of cardboard boxes into the trash pile (real ringing endorsement for city-sponsored recycling, huh?). I told him that we didn't want to just trash all that recyclable material, so he suggested going over by the employee trailers and dumping it in their recycling bin. So we did.   I have to admit that after coming all the way to a city facility dedicated to proper recycling, we felt a bit odd dumping all these boxes in a tiny bin that wasn't much bigger than our bin at home. We felt as if we had gone to a public swimming pool and found it to be the same size as our inflatable one. We also wondered if the boxes would even get recycled. Fortunately, a guy in a city truck showed up towards the end of our unloading, gave us the thumbs up, and waited for us to be done so he could unload the bin and take the materials to wherever recyclables go to die and be reborn as new, environmentally-friendly objects.   Our trip to this facility was an adventure, that's for sure. In addition to (or in spite of?) the educational benefits of seeing the inner workings of the city's solid waste operations and the entertainment value of all of those unfamiliar sights, sounds, and smells, we got to rid ourselves of the massive piles of trash and boxes left over from our move and early home improvement projects in one fell swoop. Can't beat that!

I have to preface this review by saying that I'm not a huge frozen yogurt person. I haven't tried Pinkberry and other similar trendy "froyo" places, and I tend to prefer good, old ice cream or really high-quality gelato. I thought this place was decent, but if you're a huge frozen yogurt freak, you may want to take my opinion with a grain of salt.   This place is just west of the Phoenix/Laveen border, which, prior to this place opening recently, was an area whose dessert offerings were limited to Cold Stone and what you can get at fast-food places. I was excited that a lower-fat, lower-cal option would be available (even if I'll probably just go to Fresh & Easy most of the time and pig out on their Mocha Fudge ice cream), so I went to check it out last night.   It's a clean little place with simple, brightly-colored decor. The owner greeted us warmly and immediately offered us samples from their four flavors (green tea, blueberry, plain, and another that I don't remember). The blueberry was good, but the plain was a perfect mixture of tangy and sweet and had more of an icy, gelato-like consistency than the creamy, soft-serve-like frozen yogurt that I'm used to.   I decided to order a small cup of the green tea flavor. It cost $2.19 (with the medium size at $2.99 and the large at $4.79). To get three toppings, I would have only had to pay $1.00 extra, but I wanted to try the yogurt by itself the first time. The green tea flavor was not nearly as good as the other two I tried, but it was still refreshing and enjoyable. I probably wouldn't order them, but I did want to point out that they also have fruit smoothies and protein shakes.   I'm excited that this place exists as a healthier alternative to this area's options for satisfying my sweet tooth, but it remains to be seen whether I'll be back often or just every now and then.

If ever a 5-star review were warranted, it's for this place. I'm not really sure why anyone would give less than that, to be perfectly honest. If you are looking for a very well done but quick (a combination that's the holy grail for salon services) manicure and pedicure, this is the place. The workmanship is flawless - they do everything from file the nails once the gel manicure is set to going over the edges of the pedicure with nail polish remover to ensure perfect lines. Plus, there are the little touches - the mini water bottles, extra leg massage with every pedicure and massage chairs by the entry. Plus, did I mention that they are really fast and efficient? I leave my office for an hour and return with beautiful fingers and toes. That's about as good as it gets!

I still think this place is the best nail salon around. Fast service (I always get a gel manicure and pedicure in an hour or less) but still a quality job (doesn't chip or peel for 3 weeks after). Great prices (and no crazy up-charge for nail art). Plus, they are about to move next door in the same center to a larger space. 5 stars all around!

A few weeks ago, I received a gift card for Ann Taylor Loft. Since I typically prefer shopping online, I just logged onto www.anntaylorloft.com, picked a few shirts from the sale section, and placed my order. I was definitely impressed by their selection - I always forget how classic and wearable the clothes at the Loft version of Ann Taylor are.   When I received my clothes after just a few short days, I was dismayed to find that none of the tops fit. Ahh, yes, the perils of online shopping. Dreading the painful process of returning the items by mail, I checked the website for detailed exchange instructions and was overjoyed to discover that any Ann Taylor Loft items ordered online could be returned or exchanged in store. I looked up the closest store to me, which happened to be this location in the Arizona Mills mall.   Arizona Mills has a reputation for being the worst mall in Phoenix, and I wholeheartedly agree with that characterization. However, I was definitely happy with the experience I had at this Ann Taylor Loft store and would return just to go there. As an FYI, this store is located at the beginning of "Neighborhood 4" - for some stupid reason, Arizona Mills labels the areas of the mall as "neighborhoods" - which is easily accessed by parking by the entrance that features big Marshalls and Last Call signs, entering, and then walking to your left.   When I told the salesperson that I was there to exchange some items I bought online, she told me she would keep the items ordered online at the desk while I shopped around. I was happy to find that they had a massive section of sale items, with plenty of selection in each size and color. Everything was clearly labeled, and another salesperson got me set up with a fitting room as soon as I started browsing.   When it came time to exchange the items, the salesperson did so quickly and smoothly and I left with three new items that actually fit. The whole shopping experience was seamless, and these days, that's hard to come by. I'll definitely be back to browse those sale racks again!

When my husband and I moved to South Phoenix from the Bay Area, we were used to having Asian food three or four times a week. In an average month, we'd get Thai takeout five or six times, have Chinese delivered, enjoy Vietnamese for a casual lunch, fill up on dim sum on a weekend morning, and splurge on tons of sushi and grilled fish/meat at a Japanese restaurant.   Needless to say, since moving to south Phoenix, we haven't had Asian food with nearly as much frequency. Although we have found some great Asian restaurants outside of our area, our options within a 10-15 minute range have been limited to Canton Wong #8 (a good but standard to-go Chinese joint) and Sun Asian Kitchen (a Chinese restaurant that bills itself as fine dining but is low on taste and quality).   Enter Pan Asia Sushi Chinese Fusion, which just opened this past week in the new center on the southeast corner of 24th and Baseline. We've been eagerly anticipating its opening but were afraid to get too excited. After all, it could have just as easily turned out as bad as Sun Kitchen. Based on the very generic name, we also feared that it might be some sort of buffet (as if we don't already have enough of those in this area!). Well, we tried the restaurant last night, and it totally blew us away!   The place definitely has some kinks to work out - the timing of food service was a bit off (we got our Chinese entree before our sushi), the communication between the bus boys and the servers was a little off, and the menu was a little confusing - but the decor is thoughtful and attractive (we especially loved the crystal light fixtures and the patterned wash basins in the bathrooms), the employees are friendly, and most importantly, the food is freaking incredible!   For our main dish, we ordered the Mongolian Beef ($9) off of the Chinese menu. Even though they had some much more interesting dishes (one that stood out was the Crispy Beef with Plum Sauce), we like to start with something simple so that we can determine whether the ingredients used are fresh. Well, Pan Asia passed the test on that count! The beef was literally the best quality beef I've ever had in a Chinese dish - it was tender and super-flavorful. We were left wondering if they used filet! The vegetables were also bright and fresh. Best of all, the brown sauce was spicy - it's rare for a Chinese place to have a brown sauce be spicy by default, but we loved the kick and appreciated that they didn't dumb the dish down for an Americanized palatte.   As if the entree weren't good enough, our three sushi orders (Las Vegas Roll, Philadelphia Roll, and the Yama Roll) were made with fresh and high-quality fish, well-rolled (a lot of places don't bother to actually roll the rolls well!), and artfully presented. We especially loved the unexpected touches on the dishes - swirls of eel sauce, dots of mango puree, and thinly sliced scallions. If you're not into the sweeter, fancier rolls, you may want to avoid these rolls and stick with some of the basics on the menu (they have a large nigiri/sashimi section, as well as some simple/more traditional rolls), but we really enjoyed the more inventive rolls, and from the freshness of the ingredients in the rolls we ordered, I imagine that the simpler, more fish-focused sushi items would also be really enjoyable.   We are so glad that this place opened in our area - now we can go to one spot and get both high-quality Chinese and sushi! This combination may prove useful for groups or couples with varying tastes. According to our server, a liquor license is coming soon. Since we love cocktails just as much as we love good Chinese and sushi, that's great news! In the meantime, though, we'll definitely be back as often as possible. Pan Asia isn't just good for the area - it's just plain good!

We've been back to Pan Asia for happy hour, dinner as well as take-out probably 5-6 times since I wrote my initial review and my positive opinion of the place hasn't dwindled one bit. Here are four reasons why I still love it just as much:  1. They now have a full bar and they mix up a great drink. Every other Sat, it's 2-4-1 drink night which means that you can get two top-shelf margaritas w/ Patron for $12. Awesome.  2. They keep adding new and interesting dishes to the menu. They've recently added some Thai-inspired dishes, including a delicious Thai Chow Fun with seafood. We've also had good luck with their sushi specials such as the NY combo. They're always inventive and fresh.  3. They now have 50% off food on the Saturdays that they don't offer the 2-4-1 drinks. 4. The prices. I absolutely do not think that this place is expensive given the consistent excellent quality of the ingredients used. On a Saturday night with the 2-4-1 pricing, my husband and I had four drinks, 2 chinese entrees, and 3 sushi plates here for under $80. Try getting that at any place in Scottsdale. Of course, you could get cheaper sushi elsewhere but you would sacrifice quality as a result.   The only thing I really wish they would work on is the timing. When we order both sushi and Chinese, I'd like to get the sushi first as a default. I'm sure many other people agree.

I've been meaning to downgrade my two original glowing reviews for some time now and just haven't had the heart/time to do it. I've been back to Pan Asia probably 3-4 times and each time I feel like I'm climbing up a hill that's getting progressively muddier. And no one at Pan Asia seems to throw me a lifeline, or even notice that I (they?) are slipping BIG-TIME.   Sushi fish that used to be fresh no longer is, Chinese food that used to be a few steps up from take out is now barely passable (the fried rice is notably disgusting), drinks now take forever to be delivered, the gap between the sushi and Chinese delivery has grown into a chasm and worst of all, the service is schizo and un-apologetically so. I shouldn't have to make it look like I'm going to walk out without paying to get someone to come to my table.   Pan Asia owners/managers, this is my advice to you: Stop focusing on creating a thousand different confusing specials (Who can keep track of things like "Chinese is 30% if you come between 5:15 and 5:30 but only if you take it to go after purchasing a drink at the bar"?!) and trying to be everything to everyone and go back to your roots. Produce quality sushi and hot entrees that are well-timed and focus on giving great service, and then people like us (who actually are willing to pay full price for food) won't be so damn turned off.

Since I didn't have a full meal at Metro, I'll keep this review short and sweet (and reserve full judgment for a future visit/review).   I went to Metro for the Adopt a Family UYE. Thanks again to Gabi for planning and Metro for hosting--it was great to see Yelpers come together for a great cause.   Our first server was a little brusque (the French influence, I'll presume) and our second server was very friendly but a little too earnest. If I return, I'd like to see a balance between the two hospitality styles.   I didn't have a drink because I was feeling the onset of a cold (shocker, I know!), but everyone else commented that their mixed drinks and wine were enjoyable. I did take a sip of someone's gin fizz and thought the flavor was fantastic.   The complimentary appetizers Metro provided were also quite enjoyable. The pate and onion tart were solidly executed, but the real standout was the fried oysters. The oysters themselves were clearly the freshest available and the crispy, salty coating was to die for. In that moment, I was wishing I had ordered an icy cold beer to go along with them!  This area of Scottsdale is very far from where I live, but I could see myself returning here for dinner at some point in the future. I'd be even more persuaded to return if I were promised some more free appetizers!

I was part of J-Man's brunch party last Sunday. Having had such a great experience at Metro the first time around, I was also really disappointed by the service (or lack thereof) we experienced. The food my husband and I ordered was actually very good (he had the burger with gruyere and I had the quiche as well as the vanilla-scented yogurt) but the service was just bad.   Given the fact that the restaurant wasn't nearly as full as I've seen places at brunch and the fact that we weren't unusually demanding or confusing, I think that the bad service was unacceptable. Rather than sitting back and enjoying our friend's birthday brunch, we ended up literally spending half of our time reminding the server of things we needed but never got. When we eventually complained to the manager, she did comp a bottle of champagne but the service didn't improve after that.   I really did enjoy the food I tried and thought the specialty drinks (try the French 75) were well-made but they all weren't good enough to compensate for the service. It seems like the bad service is a common complaint among Yelpers so I would hope the management/owners would take that into consideration and do something to make it better.

All in all, I found dinner at Sens to be a really enjoyable experience. Coming from the Bay Area, where "modern Asian," "Asian fusion," and "Asian tapas" places are a dime a dozen, it's hard not to compare Sens to the many great places that have mastered the whole upscale pan-Asian thing. That being said, I think Sens has three goings for it that many small plates places I've been to do not:  1. Value. While Phoenicians might think that Sens is expensive for how much food you ultimately get, the prices are actually quite low compared to a lot of Asian tapas places I've been. Four of us each paid around $175 for a full meal (which, for us big eaters, consisted of 8-10 dishes) and drinks. To put things in perspective, diners at the "modern Vietnamese" place where I used to work would drop that much between two people to truly be full and get a taste of everything.   2. Great drinks. A lot of upscale Asian places offer fun-sounding drinks but they tend to be some sort of syrupy tropical fluff rather than well-executed cocktails that really complement the food. Not so at Sens. The strawberry basil martini I got was well-sized, strong (in terms of the vodka), and had enough sweetness to balance the food (but wasn't too saccharin). My friend's and my husbands got some spicy drinks (called "Hot Mama" and some other similarly titillating name), which seemed like an unwise move given the fact that our food was already spicy, but the drinks themselves were awesome. Definitely better than the grotesque Pad Thai martini at Sens' sister restaurant, Fate.   3. Relative uniqueness. Nothing like Sens exists in downtown Phoenix, let alone in a 15-mile radius around it. That makes it cool--at least for now. In 5 years, I can imagine Phoenix being filled with upscale Asian places with specialty drinks, small plates to share, and zen-like decor. At that point, Sens will have to reinvent itself to survive. But for now, it stands alone and that's worth a shout-out.   Anyone who knows me knows that I won't end a restaurant review without discussing the food at least briefly. Sens has good food, but some of the flavors just feel like a forced attempt to make something taste "Asian." The cold duck in five-spice sauce and the dipping sauces for the tofu dishes (although I loved the tofu) were just a bit sugary for my taste--more reminiscent of Americanized Chinese than more authentic cuisine. In the end, the dishes I enjoyed the most were the ones that blended something unexpected with an Asian flavor--the perfect example was the red curry chicken wings. What could be better than greasy fried wings coated in a zesty and spicy curry sauce? The sugar cane pork was also a unique dish that combined chop-like pieces of pork with an unexpected stroke of sweetness.   I truly appreciate what Sens brings to the table figuratively and almost all of what it brings to the table in the literal sense. I'm sure I will back many times for drinks and bites with good friends.

I've been back to Sens three or four times since my original review and I've got to say, this place has risen above "It's just good for Phoenix" in my not-so-humble opinion. Here are the top three reasons why Sens is a kick-ass experience every time:   *The drinks are just good. My glass of Sauvignon Blanc hit the spot with my spicy meal, the saketini with fruit flavors was good without being too sweet, and the Spicy Mama never failts to disappoint.  *The food really hits the spot, especially after drinking. We went there on Christmas Day after a very extended brunch and on Saturday night after happy hour and everything tasted just right - savory, spicy, hearty. Just the kind of flavors you need to soak up the booze :). I will say, though, that the $2 price tag for the scoop of rice is a bit excessive. With all that great sauce, there really should be more rice for the price (yes, that rhymes).  *The server we've had pretty much every time is very energetic and makes you feel like you're having a fun dining experience. She could be a bit more attentive once the meal's in progress, but I like her vibe.   And, if you needed a fourth reason to love Sens, they just unveiled a brand new indoor-outdoor bar (getting rid of the little private room they had before), as well as an outdoor area with loungey furniture. The bar is gorgeous, with custom tilework and the whole look is just really sleek. Plus, they moved the DJ outside, which is a huge improvement over having him stuck in the corner by the hostess stand.

I really, really, really want to like this place. Why? Because it's on the first floor of my office building, making it the perfect location for those days I've been too rushed to eat breakfast or when I'm too caught up in work to leave for lunch. Unfortunately, the location (and friendly service) are about all this place has to offer.   The espresso drinks aren't half bad - in fact, my Americano was comparable to that at most other coffee places - but the veggie sandwich I had was atrocious. First of all, it had random veggies like black olives and shredded carrots that don't usually appear on veggie sandwiches. At least in 2008, vegetarian items are expected to be as interesting and tasty as meat-based dishes, and someone ordering a veggie sandwich is expecting hearty vegetables like asparagus, mushrooms, or artichokes not the toppings from a house salad. As if the veggie selection weren't bad enough, everything was absolutely drowning in mayo and the bread was dry. Not good. Not good at all.  Dagwood's definitely has convenience going for it, but I'd rather drive 2-3 minutes and get a great sandwich at Wildflower, the Vig, or Bertha's.

200th review! And on the last day of December 2008, of all days. 2008 was a great year for Phoenix Yelp but not for Phoenix itself as one local business after another closed its doors and efforts to revitalize downtown didn't do so well. Anyone who attended the downtown pub crawl can attest to that.   I really believe that 2009 can be a better year for Phoenix, though, and I think that the light rail being open (and creating a flow up and down the central corridor) will definitely help. The other thing I think will help is entrepreneurs like Karl Kopp (the owner of Hanny's) being willing to take risks and open businesses that may not necessarily fit the cookie cutter mold of what a "cool" Phoenix establishment should be. I really applaud him for that.   In some sense, opening a business that's different than what people are used to or expect helps you create a cult following--not everyone will like you, but if enough people refuse to listen to the other people who don't like you, you will create a pretty passionate crowd of supporters. I really think that Hanny's will gain this type of cult following and then over time, as similar types of businesses gain a footing in Phoenix, it will become a place everyone accepts. Or that won't happen and I'll pray that enough people start to see the magic so that Hanny's won't be the next business to close!  In case you think that I only like Hanny's because it's different or new, I want to emphasize that I also really liked the food and drinks my husband and I tried. Yes, the martinis were small (my husband had the special Hanny's martini with vodka and gin and I had a French martini), but they were mixed well and at only $5, my husband's was well priced for the size.   We also both thought the food was really well executed. We especially loved the pizza with prosciutto and arugula. The crust was definitely too thin even for "Roman style"--having been to Rome five times, I can tell you that the crust there has a bit more substance to it, but the ingredients on Hanny's pizza were simple and fresh, which I know to be an authentically Italian approach to pizza making. But I can see how you might be disappointed if you are used to very saucy and savory pizza. The pork loin sandwich was also really good--the thinly sliced pork was very flavorful and the bread was nice and crusty. The green peppers were a bit strange, though, as they made the pork taste more Mexican inspired than Italian.   That being said, though, I'm kind of content overall to not try to force Hanny's into a box. What I like about the place is its slight imperfections and its inability to be easily defined. Is it a bar? a restaurant? a lounge? I don't really know, but I don't really care. I think its unique character make it a great destination for those who are looking for something different in Phoenix, and I hope that it survives the economic slump that the city has been going through. If it does, maybe it will expand its offerings and become a place that everyone can appreciate.

This super-nice new Safeway is a great addition to the South Phoenix/Laveen area and provides a nice alternative to the great--but limited--shopping experience at Fresh & Easy (located on 19th Ave and Baseline) and the overwhelming and not that fresh or gourmet offerings at the massive Fry's Marketplace across the road. The selection of items is solid but not un-necessarily large.   Since the store just opened a few weeks ago, a lot of things are really marked down and I've noticed a lot of buy-1-get-1-free deals (with use of the Safeway card). Of course, being new also means that the store is super clean and that the employees are on top of their game. It's always possible that these standards will decline the longer the store is open, but I hope not because a clean and well-staffed store makes for a better grocery shopping experience!  I also wanted to point out a few of the store's amenities. Naturally, there is a Starbucks. There is also a US Bank in case that's of use to you. Most importantly (for us, at least), this location has the Signature Cafe, which offers freshly-made and affordable sandwiches! I tried the Italian Garden--it was quite tasty but needed a little less of the multiple sauces that were on it--and my husband had some roast beef selection with horseradish-flavored cheese. Delish! And only $11 or so for both of us. The Signature Cafe also serves gelato, which is probably not homemade, but it's cool to have that as a local dessert option.   Check this place out if you live nearby. I guarantee a pretty top-notch shopping experience!

I am 100% not afraid to admit that I "fake bake" every now and then. In fact, I'm proud to say that I've been fake tanning 15-20 times in my life. While I won't go so far as to expound on the many benefits of "sun therapy" (which my old tanning salon in CA used to on a very large sign in each tanning room), I will say that I find tanning in a bed very relaxing and enjoy rewarding myself with a nice glow.   I had seen this location of Club Tan many times--ironically enough, while going in and out of my kickboxing class at the martial arts academy, which is right next door to Club Tan--but didn't bother to go in until a month or so ago when I felt like I had started seeing results from the class and wanted a tan to go along with the tone. Plus, in the harsh Phoenix winter, my summer glow had definitely started to fade.   Anyway, I was greeted by the owners, Chris and Gary, who were really friendly and very clearly explained all of the salon's offerings. Since most people's choice of a tanning salon depends on the type of beds and pricing options, I figured I'd pass along a simple breakdown:  Bed Types:  -Cobra (normal bed): $8 for single session, $22.50 per month, $49 per month for unlimited use, $99 for 2 month unlimited plus one month free, 1 UNIT -Montego (one up from normal bed; appears to be the standup kind): $15 per single session, $49.50 per month, $79 for 1 month unlimited, $159 for 2 month unlimited plus 1 month free, 2 UNITS -Lotus (high-end bed with higher exposure; this is the one that I used): $20 for one session, $99 for 1 month unlimited, $199 for 2 months plus 1 month unlimited, 3 UNITS -Cayenne (highest bed with very little exposure time needed): $26 for single session, $79.50 per month, $120 for 1 month unlimited, $240, 2 months unlimited plus 1 month free, 4 UNITS  As you can see, each bed has a corresponding unit value. You can also buy packages that consist of units (and not uses of a particular bed), so that you can mix and match. This is what I got, although I ended up liking the Lotus bed so much that I just requested it again when I went back. I tanned for 8-10 minutes each time and got a really nice glow.   If you're interested in getting rid of some winter pastiness, definitely check out Club Tan. I don't know how the other locations are, but based on the way this one was, I'm willing to bet that they're worth a look (or a few minutes in the bed slathered in coconut scented lotion!).

One of my least favorite things about staying in hotels is that their to-go or quick-service breakfast options usually suck. The breakfast options usually consist of Starbucks-brand coffee, some generic pastries and maybe a pre-prepared breakfast sandwich or two. Since I don't eat meat, I'm usually stuck with an over-sugared pastry. By mid-morning, I'm crashing and I don't have the protein I need to recover from the night before :)  Enter Crave Cafe with a game-changing approach to hotel breakfast. I'm staying at the Montelucia this weekend for my husband's law firm event, and the wine was free-flowing last night. Needless to say, I woke up craving a breakfast burrito and in need of serious caffeine.   Crave did the trick, with a pre-made breakfast burrito that was actually vegetarian! It was tasty, with perfectly cooked eggs, some winter veggies including squash and a bit of real cheese. To top it all off, it was only $3.99, practical highway robbery for a hotel spot. I also scored an iced Americano with perfectly brewed espresso and a to-go water with a cup and straw (I love when places make it easy to get water). I was impressed by the friendly staff and the other food options, including bottles of wine and, yes, delicious sugary looking pastries :) Hey, I didn't say I was against the sweets, did I? I just know I like to have a solid, protein-packed breakfast, and I was impressed by Crave's ability to fulfill that desire.

Arcadia is such a mecca for upscale lunch places (Wildflower, Pita Jungle Chelsea's Kitchen, La Grande Orange, Acacia and more are all within a few miles of each other) that it's easy to miss some hole-in-the-wall lunch spots that compete with (or beat out) the more well-known places in the area. The first spot like this that I discovered (and was surprised to see that only a few people had reviewed) was Bertha's Cafe. Then, thanks to Joel L and Sean O's reviews, I stumbled upon Chestnut Lane.   What a great place! Truly. The atmosphere is striking with refreshingly simple and minimalist decor that's interrupted only by gorgeous brightly-colored fresh flowers. The  menu is up on a simple board with a few cafeteria-like selections in glass cases. The woman who either owns or manages the place is clearly passionate about what she does and is very friendly and efficient in running the place.   What about the food, you ask? Well, what I've tried is been really flavorful and satisfying. A few standouts: the house salad with arugula, orange wedges, parmesan and candied walnuts (I don't love salads so if I like one, you can bet it's good!); the pumpkin black bean soup; and the tuna melt.   I have not yet had the pleasure of trying the corn chowder (the soup rotates on a daily basis), but I have this feeling that I will love it, especially if it's paired with the delicious crusty bread. Personally, I thought the blackberry lemonade was a bit sweet, but I can picture watering it down with some club soda (and maybe some vodka?). Now that's homemade I can truly appreciate!  Definitely check Chestnut Lane out if you're in the mood for a fresh, good-quality and affordable (for the area) lunch. You won't be disappointed.

Tried the corn chowder and it was divine. I especially loved the grated Vermont white cheddar on top!

Back in January, I was feeling incredibly stressed and decided to try out a true yoga class for the first time. (It's hard to believe that a California girl like me had never done yoga before, but I was so into Pilates before moving to Arizona that I never really thought about switching over). My main focus was on the meditative aspect, although of course, physical toning was important to me.   Metta gets four stars because of the flexible class times (really nice to be able to make something before or after work), clean studio, nice front desk staff, great intro pricing ($30 for 15 days of unlimited classes), and encouraging instructors. The only drawbacks for me are: 1) they don't offer hot yoga, which I think would be a nice plus and something I would have liked to try; and 2) the instructors were sometimes a bit too hands-on for me to really focus on my energy. I'm all for helping me learn the poses better, but I also was there for personal reasons and the interference was distracting, at times.   All in all, I think this is a solid place, and I'm glad my first yoga experience was here. Now that I work downtown, I'll probably try something in that area, but I would definitely return here if I had a workplace or home nearby.

When first visiting Gallo Blanco in 2009, I would have definitely given it 3 stars. Service was very spotty and the HH was a lot more limited. Now, after visiting this place countless times for brunch, dinner and HH, I really do think it's an affordable, reliable and delicious destination that makes sense for a lot of different types of social situations - from a meal shared with my grandmother to a spontaneous HH with friends. As many reviewers have mentioned, happy hour is fantastic here, with tacos from $1 - $2.50 and great drink prices. Here are some of my favorite food and drink items (keep in mind that I'm a pescetarian, so meat didn't make it on the list!):   *Agua fresca of the day w/ or w/o vodka *Picoso (tequila, pineapple and jalapeno)  *Micheladas (make 'em bloody for a great hangover cure) *Bloody Marys (they make them with dill for an unexpected but fresh twist) *Elote (Mexican corn) with cotija cheese and cream  *Shrimp tacos (amazing, juicy shrimp)  *Chilaquiles (the sauce used to have chicken but they now offer a vegetarian version) *Chopped salad  One other awesome bonus is that the bar will wrap up food to go if you'd like to take up to the roof. Get your drink in a plastic cup and you're all set!

I'll just start this one off by telling the truth: it's harder to shop local. It takes commitment (shopping online or going to big box stores can be so easy), time (you may need to stop at multiple places) and money (not that it's crazy expensive, but some items can be more expensive). That said, for someone like me who absolutely loves to give unique gifts (and who really wants to see Central Phoenix blossom), shopping local has been my Christmas commitment for the past two years.   And, this year was my second year in a row going to Stupid Cupid to get a ton of great gifts for a bunch of people on my list. Pricing options were great, with small gifts/stocking stuffers, mid-range gifts like handcrafted jewelry, and pricier local art. I love how easy the store is to navigate and the owner, Rob, is always friendly and will help if needed (or stay out of your way, if that's your style!). He also does a great job wrapping up your purchases to give as gifts.   My only gripe about the inventory is that there aren't as many male-oriented gifts as I might like. Stupid Cupid should take a cue from Frances, which has some great clocks, flasks, books, etc. oriented toward a male recipient. I definitely think they could be incorporated while still keeping with the whimsical, handcrafted vibe of the store.  They say the third time's a charm and I hope to make next Christmas my third anniversary shopping local at Stupid Cupid!

Well, hello Phoenix Yelpers. It's certainly been a while since my last review (maybe a confession is in order?). Well, even though I have lots of recent business experiences that I could have chosen to write about as part of my triumphant return, I think I will (re-)start by reviewing a local business run by hard-working people committed to quality results. What could be better than that?  My husband, Myles M, found Angel Eye on Kudzu.com, which is great but not as great as Yelp, of course! Now that I'm reviewing them on Yelp, it should be even easier for people to find them, which is a very good thing for the following reasons:   1. They respond to inquiries really promptly. I emailed them for a quote and had a well-written, detailed response in my inbox just an hour or so later.  2. They confirmed with me the day before and morning of my first scheduled service. Life gets hectic and there's nothing better than a reminder (or two) of an upcoming appointment.  3. They arrived promptly without calling fifty times for directions. We've hired service providers who have called asking for step-by-step instructions for arriving at our home. That's what Google Maps is for.  4. They asked for clarification. As any teacher, parent or boss would say, it's better to ask and do something right than to not ask and do it wrong.  5. They got the job done and did it well. In just four hours (keep in mind we have a fairly large house that hasn't been cleaned in, say, 9 weeks), our house sparkled from top and bottom. I almost didn't want to cook a meal or walk around for fear of dirtying the place!  6. They were upfront about their rates and didn't try to upcharge when the work was completed. We all appreciate honest and fair dealings, especially in this day and age.   After seeing the results of their first cleaning, I hired Angel Eye to come back for bi-monthly cleanings. I look forward to having a great relationship with them (and a very clean house) for years to come!

It's hard to give a two-star review for Karey's Kitchen given the storm of very positive reviews so far, but anything more feels really inaccurate given my two experiences there. Let me explain myself.   The first time I went to this place (which is just a few blocks from my office), I really liked the food but found the service hit-or-miss (albeit ridiculously friendly). As of April of this year, I had stopped eating meat, so I was unable to order anything from the ready-made lunch buffet. Not the restaurant's fault, per se, but it would have been helpful to know from the extensive "laundry list" online menu that fish/tofu items had to be made to order. I did end ordering a noodle bowl with tofu and shrimp but it took 25 minutes. Even though the man helping me was incredibly apologetic, it was frustrating on a busy work day to be so held up. The noodle cake he offered me was also good but hard to eat before I had actually eaten my savory lunch! Again, though, my noodles were greasy but really good.   The second time I came to Karey's Kitchen, I brought a co-worker. She eats meat, so she ordered items from the lunch buffet. I again ordered something off the menu and we also ordered some vegetarian fried rolls to share. When my food finally came, we dug in. Her pork-based dish was incredibly greasy and she described the meat as being "suspect." My vegetarian dish (essentially a tofu rice bowl) was good but also very greasy. Worst of all, the vegetarian rolls had meat in them! Third strike...  I do truly appreciate how nice the staff at this place was each time there were mess-ups. I was also really impressed by the way they leveraged social networking (Facebook, Twitter) to advertise their opening and spread awareness. I also understand that as a family-owned business, they are short-staffed. All that said, they need to focus on doing fewer menu items better and should add some vegetarian/fish items to their main lunch menu so people like me don't have to wait half an hour for a special order.

This place is awesome. Because Phoenix isn't a walking city, I tend to not go to coffee shops to do a few hours of work, choosing instead to sit on my couch with laptop in hand, but Urban Beans is the kind of place that makes me want to spend a few hours being productive--or just surfing Facebook. (Isn't it funny how you can feel productive doing social networking when you're at a cafe surrounded by semi-urbanites?)  So, what makes Urban Beans different from other local coffee spots? A few things: the staff is really nice, the plugs are plentiful (although watch your step when you're crossing an open area), and they have really good, affordable food options. (Try the pear flatbread or the quiche!).   My biggest complaint is the music. I'm OK with emo but some sort of batshit-crazy guy doing spoken word over Enya-like strings is enough to throw me--the ultimate multitasker--into distraction land. Keep it simple, folks, and this place may just become good enough for the coveted five stars.

I'm going to up my review for Urban Beans to five stars. The music generally seems to have improved, but more importantly, the weekend brunch offerings are awesome. In addition to a la carte items, UB offers a great multi-course breakfast, with your choice of side, main dish (including custom omelet), coffee and adult beverage (choice of mimosa or bloody mary). I don't remember the exact price but it's around $15 and worth every penny. And, if I'm going to have to be a coffee shop working on Sunday, it's awesome to be able to get a real breakfast and not just a pastry. Highly recommended :)

3 stars for a great happy hour. 1 extra star for having happy hour 7 days a week (from 3pm-7pm). If more places did happy hour every day of the week, I'd be drinking and eating all the time...oh, wait.   Anyway, here's the happy hour download:  -Wine by the glass: $2 off -Domestic bottles: $3 -Draft beers: $4 -Sangria: $4 -Specialty Cocktails: $7  In addition, they also have multiple food items at the $4, $6 and $8 price points.   We sampled the "Lemoncello" (in quotes because it should be "Limoncello" - note to management) martini as well as the Grapefruit Basil Fizz. Both were delicious, although the basil one was definitely the best. For food, we had the spinach artichoke dip and the arancini (rice balls). Neither was amazing but a great value for the money.   I thought the service was attentive and efficient, although the food runners needed to learn which spot at the bar was which table number since they kept delivering other people's food to us.   Finally, while this has zero impact on my review, there is a very bizarre picture of a dark-haired shirtless man with dark chest hair in a very flirtatious pose hanging in the women's restroom. As my Facebook friend pointed out, it looks more like bad 80s porn than restaurant wall art. While entertaining, it probably makes sense to replace with some generic pic of the Colosseum or something!

I've had the last week off before starting my new job. In that time of leisure, I just knew that my bucket list would include a leisurely lunch at some cute place with a patio. Having already eaten at many of the typical spots (e.g., Postino, Chelsea's Kitchen, the Vig, etc.), I poked around on Yelp and decided that 5th and Wine would be a nice change.   I was definitely not disappointed. Based on Gabi's review, I tried the Vegetable Salad. I loved the selection of crispy veggies, and the dressing was awesome. I could have gone with a darker, leafier lettuce, though. I also really enjoyed the bruschetta, although I thought the toppings were better than the bread, which was a little soft for my taste and not quite on par with Postino, which really just gets how bruschetta should be.   The standouts of my meal were really two things besides my main course: 1. the service, which was attentive and professional, but not annoying; and 2. the already-famous Bloody Mary martini, with jalapeno vodka and fresh mozzarella garnish.   Since I live much closer to places like Cheuvront and Postino, I highly doubt I'll drive all the way to Old Town just to go to 5th and Wine, but I would definitely drop by again if I were shopping at Fashion Square.   Oddly enough, the night after this, I ended up at HH at The Living Room, which is apparently owned by the same folks that own 5th and Wine. In some ways, I was disappointed since their menu is the same, but I think it's a testament to how solid their places are that I still really enjoyed my HH there. Anyway, separate review on that to come :)

So, I literally just reviewed 5th and Wine, the Scottsdale place owned by the same proprietors that own this wine bar/bistro in Chandler, which makes me a feel a bit repetitive since the menus are pretty much identical, but I'll give you the Cliff Notes version of the food and drink review and then move on to what's unique about this place.   Food: *Bruschetta toppings are really solid but bread is a bit soft *Vegetable salad is really fresh but could use better lettuce *Tuna panini was really good and quite large for the price  Drink  *Bloody Mary Martini with jalapeno vodka and fresh mozzarella garnish is where it's at *The glass of Albarino ($5 during happy hour) was really crisp and good  What makes the Living Room different is that it's much more of a swanky/loungey feel, while the 5th and Wine spot feels a bit more cafe-like. Also, the outdoor area of the Living Room is super comfortable, with big couches to lounge on, a sweet fireplace, and a lovely breeze (if you're lucky enough to be there in March, like I was!). Our server was also decidedly less formal than the one at 5th and Wine but still very on top of it.   I would definitely not drive back to South Chandler to go to this place, but I would certainly do so if I lived closer.

Just like Amy B, I found out this place opened because someone came by my nearby office building with 2-for-1 flyers. I've probably been back three times since and have definitely been impressed with the drinks I've had - Americano and a pineapple mango iced tea. I also had a delicious handmade scone one of the visits.   Definitely don't come if you're in a rush, as the cashier/barista can be a bit slow. (Quality takes time, and he's playing two roles). Another drawback is that while the spaces are optimized for working on laptops (I love the four-person table by the door), there are no plugs available and the wireless info (the fact that they had it or the login info) wasn't front and center. I had to walk up and ask, which was a bit weird.   Regardless, I definitely like this place for a good handcrafted beverage and I'm sure I'll return many times as long as I'm working or living close by.

The Main Ingredient has a few things against it that I want to get past right off the bat:    *It's definitely not the most vegetarian-friendly restaurant around. There are certainly choices, but they're not extensive.  *The margaritas are not good at all. Given that their Bloody Marys are great and I've had other good mixed drinks there, they would do well to invest in some fresh squeezed juice for their cocktails.  Other than that, there are a lot of things I really like about this place. First, I think the vegetarian items I have had are delicious. The veggie sandwich is done really well with great bread and the grilled cheese has the perfect combination of muenster, havarti and cheddar. Perhaps the biggest standout is Sophie's Salad, marrying crunchy pine nuts and red onions with fresh mozzarella and basil. Delicious!  I also adore the patio. It's a great size with lots of tables and just feels picturesque in front of the old house (even though 7th Street is right there). What a great place to spend a cold night or a breezy spring day. The only time it's not great is in the middle of the summer (as there are no misters). I wish that more of the old homes in the Coronado District had nice, open front patio areas.  Last but not least, the service has always been good the few times I've been. No one has been overly attentive but my needs have always been met.

I first tried this place last Sunday and I went back yesterday for more. Given that I'm not much of a "regular" (I crave variety to an unhealthy degree), this says a lot.   Both times I've gone, I ordered the La Condesa shrimp tacos, which were positively fantastic. The shrimp is great quality and perfectly grilled to bring out its natural sweet flavor. I also love the robust veggie filling, including sauteed spinach, onions and peppers - the spinach is especially flavorful and a unique addition for sure. My only gripe with the tacos (and this is just a personal thing) is that each comes with two corn tortillas, which appears to be necessary to hold the hearty fillings but is a little carb-heavy for my tastes.   But who I am I kidding? By the time my tacos arrived, I'd already devoured an entire basket of delicious, not-too-greasy chips with a ton of great salsas from the salad bar. Why stop there? :)  Speaking of salsa, while I like the more traditional ones, I think that the unusual flavors are the most delicious. For example, the sesame one tastes great drizzled on top of the shrimp tacos, and the peanut one was really solid with the chips. Both Asian-seeming sauces. Both surprisingly great matches for the savory Mexican flavors.   The final thing I wanted to mention is the Jamaica (pronounced Huh-my-kah) drink, which is essentially sweetened hibiscus tea. It's delicious but I think it's a tad too sweet for me. I'd love if it was watered down a bit.   This is definitely my new Sunday spot, but of course, check back with me in a few weeks. If I've still been hitting this place up on a weekly basis, you KNOW it's good!

I still love this place. A lot. Perhaps even more so now that I can walk there from my apartment. One thing I forgot to mention in my last review is their fantastic margaritas, which have squeezes from fresh orange or grapefruit, pack a punch and are very cheap ($6) for the size.   I know I said I'm not much of a "regular," but La Condesa has made me one. Spectacular.

I first learned about Downtown Phoenix Dental when Dr. Berschler promoted his grand opening on Yelp with an open house posted in the Events section. I was highly impressed by his good (and not overly promotional) use of the Yelp resources. (Note to other business owners: You don't have to aggressively solicit positive reviews or have your friends write fake ones to get the positive attention of the Yelp community.)  I recently started working downtown so when it came time for my June dentist appointment, I decided to contact Ben for an appointment. (I had also had a few negative experiences at Center Care Dental and was already looking for a new provider.)   I was more than happy with my first appointment. The clean, modern office was just a few blocks away from my office, so I was able to walk. The front desk staffer was really nice, but my hygienist, Heather, was truly a gem. Super nice and approachable, she was also very knowledgeable about all things teeth. Best of all, she delivered her advice and suggestions without being judgmental or rude. She also was very skilled at doing a deep cleaning while still being gentle (I have very sensitive gums). The digital x-rays were also a huge plus.   Dr. Berschler was also great in the brief time I spent with him. I liked his down-to-earth attitude and lack of pretension. I will definitely return here for my future cleanings.

Man, oh man, am I late to the party on this one! I have been going to Celi at Shampoo Ink for about 2 years now (4-5 appointments within that timeframe) and she really is fantastic for coloring and cutting curly hair. They always say "it takes one to know one," and that Celi has curly hair herself definitely gives me an extra boost of confidence (outside, of course, of the great results I get every time). She has done a variety of color jobs for me - from ombre to dark to red - and the results have been vibrant and long-lasting.   Two other benefits of this great spot:  1. Price - they charge a lot  less for cut, color and style that most other places I've been and I think it's a great deal for the quality 2. Hours - they are open late on weeknights which is great for the working professionals out there (don't know about you, but I can't really take a half day off of work just to get my hair done)   My boyfriend has also been going to Shampoo Ink to get his hair done. His stylist of choice is Alli and she has also done a great job for him.   Highly recommended!

This place is the shit - so much so that I'm willing to take the light rail all the way from midtown to partake of its delicious drinks and food.   Happy hour runs every night of the week, including Saturdays and Sundays, from 4-6:30 and it's one of the best HHs in Phoenix, in my opinion (and I thought that before Phoenix Magazine rated it as such). You can get 50% of house margaritas (quite large and decently strong), bottled/draft beer, premium well drinks and all tequilas. Plus, select food items, including some of the best vegetarian tacos I've ever had, are also 50% off. Those mushroom tacos with roasted blue cheese make any reasonable person not miss meat and have a very complex and sophisticated flavor profile.   The cool indoor/outdoor vibe is the icing on the cake and makes this a perfect place for Phoenix day drinking. Take the light rail there, get drunk and soak up the rays. You won't regret it.

This place is a hidden gem, which is a bit odd to say since it's located right in Downtown Phoenix, but as we all know, CityScape is still not exactly over-run with crazed shoppers. Anyway, I'm hoping that downtown/CityScape do take off so that places like Charming Charlie can stick around.   The merchandise is very accessories-focused with tons of jewelry, clutches, shoes, purses, scarves, hair items, etc. - clustered by color. The volume is like the accessories collections from Forever 21, H&M and Target combined. There are also some very cute tops and dresses throughout the store but clothing is definitely a secondary focus. Personally, I would go elsewhere for clothes but I love the idea of going to one store and being able to find a [insert item here] to match any outfit I'm putting together. Today, I went in to look for a clutch to match a specific pair of shoes I'll be wearing in Vegas next weekend and it only took 5 minutes. Love it.   I'm sure I'll be back many times.

What a great little spot! Off the beaten path and "off the hook" as well!   I had seen some previous reviews on Yelp but hadn't thought to check the place out. My parents were in town today and saw a full-page feature in the New Times on this place, so my dad suggested trying it. By the time we arrived after our delightful yoga class at Urban Yoga (how very Central Phoenix - I know, I know), it was about 1:40 and the place was completely empty. Sometimes, that can result in a less-than-enthusiastic greeting from owners or waitstaff but the man who greeted us was friendly and seemed genuinely happy that we were there. I love that.   He took our drink order right away. The sodas were a little under-carbonated but no big deal. Easily fixed, for sure. My mom raved about her iced tea, so no complaints there.   The menu was a little smaller than I expected (the owner later explained that he wanted to start more minimal and then branch out after getting a customer base, which is a good strategy IMO), but several things stood out to me. My dad and I ordered loat chat, worm-shaped rice noodles, but substituted tofu for beef (not immediately obvious that we could do this but we were gracefully accommodated), and the stir-fried shrimp (came with white rice, pickled vegetables and an egg roll). My mom chose the chicken noodle soup and we also got some fresh spring rolls for the table.   All of the food came out very quickly and was extremely flavorful and robust without being too greasy or salty. The shell-on shrimp were a particular favorite of mine - although they were very messy to eat, they were very tender and had a nice kick to them. The rice noodles were also great and the shredded egg on top was a delicious touch.   All in all, our meal was great - and affordable, to boot. All of our drinks, entrees and the spring rolls came out to only $34 including tax and tip. The owner was also great and we all loved his passionate approach to his business. He even told us that he opened the place because he was told that a Cambodian restaurant wouldn't survive in this city.    A rebel after my own heart. And, after all, doesn't Phoenix need more rebels?

I really liked my first experience at Windsor. My sister and her boyfriend were in town last Friday and we wanted to get our weekend started early with some daytime drinks and a great lunch.   Others have pointed out the decor, so I won't beat a dead horse, but I will say that Windsor stands out from the modern-meets-rustic vibe that seems to characterize many of the newer additions to Phoenix (Parlor, St. Francis, etc.). While it has some similar design elements, it has some unique touches that make it a striking spot - I'm particular fond of the vivid green color used on the bar and the wall of cassette tapes (remember those?) leading up to the bathroom.   While I'm glad it was happy hour when we arrived (around 1:30pm), I have to say that the Postino HH window (11-5) isn't a good fit for a place that has a full bar. Since Windsor has drinks, I would hope that they would introduce a more post-work-appropriate happy hour at some point soon. That said, again, I was very thrilled to be able to get $5 Bloody Marys and they were made absolutely perfectly.   Our food was also very enjoyable, especially the mac and cheese. Gourmet mac and cheese has become about as exciting and unique as bruschetta but this mac and cheese was perfection with the perfect combination of savory cheeses and a savory crispy topping. I also thought the halibut banh mi was delicious (although I can't help but think of the Vietnamese joints where you can get a sandwich like this for ~$8 bucks) and the kale Caesar was crisp and had great texture.   The only real food disappointment was the deviled egg dip which had bacon mixed in, despite not indicating that on the menu. Sorry, but in this day and age, you really need to clearly label if your food items contain meat, especially if it's pork product.   Finally, I thought the service was enthusiastic but spotty. There were some things we wanted but didn't get in a timely fashion, so some improvement could definitely be made there. All in all, though, I really liked my experience at Windsor and will definitely be back.

I just wanted to throw an additional compliment Windsor's way because of the way they handled a situation a few weeks ago. I made a reservation for 18 people for a triple birthday party and confirmed several times beforehand. When we arrived, we were split into two tables close to each other but not really close enough to have interaction. Disappointed by the set-up, I spoke with the manager inside. In addition to genuinely apologizing for the situation, he promised to "see what he could do" and get back to me. Sure enough, within minutes, he and his team cleared off a neighboring table and pushed it together with one of ours so we could all sit together and enjoy our delicious food and drinks. They were also very accommodating when we needed to do separate checks at the end of the meal. Ordinarily, I'm all about the food, but when service is this great, I have to say something. Kudos, Windsor!

I have to preface this review by saying that I've never been all that into going to salons/ spas or the whole "pampering" thing. With the exception of getting my eyebrows waxed regularly at Dizin Salon, I pretty much do everything else (hair dying/styling, makeup, facials) myself. I'm especially bad about getting my hair cut, and I usually wait until my ends get really, well, split, before going in to get a trim. And then, of course, I've waited so long that it has to be a cut and not a trim. Anyway, I digress. My point is just that I'm not really into the whole super-girly, soft music playing, and the scent of candles wafting scene. And that's exactly why I loved my first experience at Mood Swings - it's not your typical, frou-frou salon. Instead, it's a comfortable, chic place to get a good haircut.    As several reviewers have already described, it's surprising when you walk up to the salon and then realize it's on the second floor, up these cool fire-escape-like stairs. When you walk through the double doors, you feel like you've just stepped into an urban loft. The ceilings are painted black, which I think is really cool. Instead of having partitioned off work stations, the stations kind of float in the space, divided from each other only by the mirrors attached to them. It's a really cool effect because you feel like you're in a bustling urban environment and not some stodgy salon.   I had made an appointment for the new client haircut - a great deal that, for only $40, gets you a scalp and hand massage, haircut, and style/finish. Stephanie was my stylist and she was really nice and professional. I really appreciate a stylist who doesn't chit-chat if you are clearly not in the mood to talk but is also a great conversationalist when you are in the mood to chat. At the beginning, I was quiet and she followed my lead, but when we went back to the station to do the haircut and styling and I struck up a conversation, she was really engaging and managed to keep up her end of the conversation even while giving me a great cut and style.   My hair looked so great after and had such a natural bounce and shine to it. I really appreciate her taking the time to style my curls and leave me with a great final product; a lot of places I've been rushed through the styling process, especially if I wasn't spending a lot of money to get my hair colored or treated.   Overall, Mood Swings was a great salon experience - cool and casual environment, friendly staff, a great haircut/style, and fabulous new client pricing all combined to make me one happy non-salon salon-goer!

Thank you, Kimpton, for bringing a classy bar, an urban vibe and truly outstanding cocktails to downtown Phoenix. God knows we needed it.   The bar space is what I would call rustic chic with a wood-based design foundation accented with glam/shiny touches. While there is plenty of seating at the fairly large bar, there is also a fantastic long community table parallel to the bar.   The service has been very good so far, with friendly bartenders and servers who are pretty prompt in delivering the drinks, which is no small feat given that each one is handcrafted and unique. Some of the smaller touches really make the drinking experience standout - from the larger block ice cubes to the daily fruit-infused water, this is definitely the place to quench your thirst and get your buzz on. Many of the drinks are outstanding, but I definitely recommend the Brown Derby (bourbon-based), Queen's Park Swizzle (rum-based) and the Rising Sun (tequila-based). But, of course, many of the others are good too, and you know I've never met an adult beverage I didn't like!   I definitely enjoy the food at Blue Hound as well (the zucchini corn dogs are awesome), but I think the menu is a little light on vegetarian selections. I wish that dishes like the cheddar biscuits and mac and cheese didn't come with bacon and ham automatically or could be made without them.   This little thing aside, though, Blue Hound is a wonderful - and important - addition to downtown Phoenix and I say "welcome"!

For the Central Phoenix crowd, the Clarendon Hotel has long been our only option for a true rooftop hangout. My heart is still with the Clarendon (gotta support local, the views are unobstructed and awesome and there's nothing like getting happy hour tacos from Gallo Blanco and a margarita in a plastic cup and taking them upstairs for a sunset feast) BUT there is a new kid in town, and it's bringing a funkier, sleeker vibe to the scene.   For starters, I love the fact that Lustre Bar is by the hotel pool. Granted, I haven't been in it yet, but one of these days, I may down too many well made daquiris and end up diving in. But I digress. The other thing that really makes Lustre cool is the furniture - from the pool lounges to the sofas, it has a very cool mid-century-modern-meets-today vibe. The views aren't too shabby either - you can look out and see the mountains to the south, as well as Chase Field and US Airways Center. My only complaint about the view is the very large advertisements covering the sides of the two large towers. Since they're only really viewable from the bar, I'm wondering how many folks they're actually going to reach. Lest I forgot, I should also mention that the few times I've been, there's been a really great DJ, adding even more to the cool atmosphere.   Last but not least, of course, Lustre Bar serves the fantastic cocktails from Blue Hound downstairs. Stop by during HH, get yourself a $6 Tommy's Margarita, kick back and enjoy the views and beats. Scottsdale may finally have some competition :)

The funny thing about Yelp's rating scale is that I'm never quite sure whether I'm ranking it against my own personal experience, the options in the area, my lofty ideals for restaurants, etc. I know that's what makes reviews fun to read, but I also know that makes them subjective to some degree. Well, all that intro inside, I think that grabbagreen deserves 5 stars for the following (hopefully) persuasive and somewhat objective reasons:   -There is nothing like it in the vast office park wasteland otherwise known as the Scottsdale Airpark area. Between Pei Wei, Wildflower and tons of other predictable options, there's not much to choose from for something simple, healthy and non-chainy. This is especially the case since the Whole Foods in the area closed.  -If you live in the Silverlake area of LA or Seattle, places like this are a dime or dozen, but there are very few places in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area where you can get a good juice, smoothie or healthy breakfast/lunch and I think it earns major points for that.  -The ingredient list for the drink and food options is comprehensive in my opinion. Avocado or squash in your smoothie, pomegranate or hemp in your brown rice bowl? Yes, please!  I know it's expensive and it's also got a douchey factor but then again, doesn't everything before it becomes a mainstay of an area? At that point, I think it just becomes hipster - or at least, run-of-the-mill/expected :)
