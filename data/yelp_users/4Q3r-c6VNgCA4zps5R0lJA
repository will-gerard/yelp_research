*Before any of you complain about the Horchata (as someone complained below), realize that it is EL SALVADORIAN horchata. COMPLETELY different.*      I hadn't had El Salvadorian food in such a long time and we had accidentally ended up at this place. The prices were fantastic, the Pupusas, Yucca frita and the plantains were all phenomenal. Everything that we ordered that was El Salvadorian was great. The waitress was kind and the place was nice. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because the Mexican food there was pretty good, but not their specialty. If you are in the neighborhood for some fantastic Central American fare, stop by this place for enough food to feed a family of five for about 40 bucks... as long as you choose wisely, of course ;-)

The lady and I decided last minute that we wanted a nice, relaxing, semi-romantic dinner. Maybe a couple of glasses of wine, nice ambiance and good food. We were looking through places to go to within a 10 mile radius, when we ran into LGO on yelp. I have been inside to check it out, but never had I had dinner there. What a fantastic decision! The place is so nice, they play good music and the wine we loved was on the list... For 10 dollars a bottle! I couldn't believe it! I thought it was $10 a glass! We had arrived later than we thought we would've, but no one ever made us feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. I was so pleased with Ryan, our server. Super nice, very accommodating and knowledgeable. Right before leaving, I asked to speak to a manager to give Ryan a commendation, and was even more pleased when talking to Chris. I have worked in restaurants before, and rarely have I met a manager (owner?) so personable, warm and genuinely kind. This SUPER nice guy, who treats his employees very well, was helping the place close down. His philosophies of being in the business were spot on and pragmatic. I was so pleased with the service overall, that even if the food was bad, I would go back. Good thing it was lovely. Please go here, you will love it.

Let me start by saying that I think T-mobile is the best mobile network in the country for anyone that travels in and out and that I had gone to this store a multitude of times before having this wretched experience.       This was the only store that I would frequent for anything mobile. Shadi had helped me out a lot, was a nice guy and was very knowledgeable. Upon returning home from a trip (where I had gotten my phone stolen overseas), I went here immediately for help. The young lady that helped me was kind and since both of our families were from the same place in Mexico, we got along great. I asked for her advice on what to do since I wasn't due for a JUMP until February and I got back home in November. She said that I could make an insurance claim and have a phone sent to my house and then JUMP it in Feb. (For those who don't know, JUMP is the T-mobile insurance plan and, in this case, JUMP is the act of upgrading without a contract). I was sick of that phone and I really wanted an immediate solution (to have a phone on the spot since I hadn't had one for a few days by then), so she suggested getting a new phone right there and then and then making the insurance claim in February to make the JUMP. I agreed and left the store feeling happy.      I went back in February and they denied my claim because my phone had gotten stolen a few months prior and was not reported during the allotted claim filing period. You have got to be effen kidding me. I said, "Look guys, I am not trying to shoot myself in the foot here! Why would i try to sabotage myself?! There is clearly a miscommunication!" They said they would talk to said associate and would contact me to fix the problem. A manager was there and even he had said that it wasn't fair for me to have to pay for two phones because of someone's bad advice.      Guess what? I got a phone call and was told that I will be stuck paying for two phones because that young lady (that provided me with incorrect information), had denied that she ever told me this. I will never go back to this location. I have told people to steer clear. I now go to the location on 7th ave and McDowell where Joaquin as been wicked helpful. I am not happy that I am stuck paying for two iPhones. Not one bit. Especially since I just lost one of my jobs.

Let me start off by saying that Michael in the seafood department was one of the kindest most genuine people I had ever been helped by. He went out of his way to make sure I was taken care of, never did he seem fake or forced and he made my experience a great one. If that wasn't enough, Linda at the front noticed I had iced seafood and went out of her way to get me an added barrier to make sure the condensation did not get on my car's interior.       So now that I have said that: Whoever says that there is "no parking" here is obviously apathetic. Premium parking for me is shaded parking, and there is LOADS of it.... If you are willing to walk. The only store that has more parking than here is IKEA. Stop being lazy, walking is good for you.

Best Mexican carne asada quesadillas I have had in Phoenix. This place is cheap, the people are nice... well that is all you need I guess! Not sure if they even take cards, the food here is just super authentic.

Melrose kitchen is rad. It is no super-mega-fancy breakfast/ brunch spot with mimosa specials or anything like that, it is just a very humble, super affordable, cute as balls, cheeky joint with some great options on the menu. I rather enjoyed the coffee, the service and felt very welcome here. I even had some English buddies that stumbled in here while staying at my house and they had nothing but good things to say about it as well. I give it 5 stars for what it is. If I was looking at it from a pretentious point of view, maybe I would have a different opinion. Keep 'er up!

My band just played here on Saturday for our tour Kick Off show. What a night. Everything was perfect! The guys here are real pros. Everyone from Brian doing the sound (was wearing a shirt that said "Perfectionist". Accurate description!) who made us sound freaking great, to Devon behind the bar who was such a cool dude... the entire staff was so cool. This place had such a good vibe! They even had a built in green room, an old Airstream with the A/C on where the bands can change, eat, do their hair, makeup, etc. This is the best small venue I have played in Phoenix. The sound was amazing, the stage was great... the LIGHTING! Everyone told us that we looked great in that light. Not only was this my new favorite place to play in Phoenix, but it was so much fun to watch the other bands as well. I look forward to coming back!

Been meaning to write this since Sunday when we came in, just now getting a chance. I came in with my girlfriend and her sisters for the first time. We heard good things and wanted to try it out. I am not a university kid, I am a community college, rock n roll kid and I couldn't help but to scoff at some of the belligerent college bros stumbling out of some of the locations near by. No big deal, they need to have fun too I suppose! The wait was about 40 minutes, but the weather was nice and they gave us coffee. Some of the staff were nice, some seemed blah, but Kate (gosh I hope that is her name!) behind the bar was serving us and she was an A fucking + server. Best server I have had in probably years. Her suggestions were amazing, her knowledge about the food and drinks was ample and her smile was so contagious. Great service, nice mid century feel, and good food! The food was great, but not amazing (I know it is hard to do that with breakfast food) so Snooze gets 4 stars from me. If I could do 4.5, I would... Just cause the service was so good.
