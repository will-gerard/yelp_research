Downstairs bar is an absolute favorite.  Great small plates and even better service.  I love their stemware. :)

After attending First Friday this month I was excited to realize I could stop by Tammie Co, en route to the office, to grab a coffee and/or light breakfast.  So I proceeded to do so last Monday and had not a bad latte...  So today, I thought I would give it another chance and try their lunch fare.  That's is the last time I make that choice; a sad little deviled egg sandwich it was... and the 'side' was less than an amuse bouche portion.  Plus, my  bouche wasn't terribly amused.  I say stick to the pastry thing.

I love the food, (especially brunch) I love the music and I especially love your $5 mimosas.

VERY disappointed with my lunch today.    Had the trio soup, sand and salad  Soup was a corn chowder.  It was like eating a spiced container of whipped cream.  The flavor was good but it was just overkill on the cream and not enough chowdery substance.  Sand was a grilled chicken salad.  The just forgot to put it on one half of mine.  Also the bread was dense and dry.  Salad was a mixed greens with dried fruit, nuts and bleu cheese - but I am not sure if there was actually supposed to be cheese since I only had one little, I mean tiny, crumble.  Service was good - I expected so much more from the food.  Won't be going back anytime soon and it's right across the street...

The freshest most inexpensive, delicious meal around!!  2 of these dollar fifty soft tacos make a plentiful meal.  The chicken is my favorite- I could eat these little bundles 3 times a week!

Went for breakfast last weekend - arrived about 10 to a packed restaurant but managed to find a couple of seats at the bar. Ordered some pancakes, the house Ncounter omelet and a couple of drinks from the coffee bar.   We were told by the bartender to go fetch our own silverware and water. Our food arrived prior to our drinks and my omelet was REALLY cold - like I mean the broccoli was still slightly frozen - too bad considering it's their house specialty - the hashbrowns were also undercooked and the cream cheese glob was just overkill on the omelet.  Our coffees finally showed up, bu they must have run short on milk since there was a two inch gap at the top of my cup.  Fortunately, the pancakes were pretty darn good.   Needless to say, we won't be making the drive from Phoenix again any time soon...
