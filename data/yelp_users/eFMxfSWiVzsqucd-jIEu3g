Their service advisors recommended a transmission fluid flush that my car did not need (per a discussion I had with Mazda corporate). When I posted about this to their Facebook page they simply deleted the post instead of responding. They will not be getting my business ever again.

Super helpful staff. Nice atmosphere amazing food.  I went in with my 2 year old daughter and the highchair we were given had a broken strap. Mentioned it to the staff and they found an alternate in back and apologized profusely.   Our waiter was both prompt and knowledgeable (Had some questions since their menu is short on the description side).  Ended up trying their pot roast sandwich which was flavorful and left me stuffed.   Overall a perfect dining experience, will definitely be going back.
