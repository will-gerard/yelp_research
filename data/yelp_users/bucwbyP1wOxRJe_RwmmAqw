I am a big fan of South Mountain. This is my fave place to hike/trail run. I can literally spend all day exploring new trails. Many of the trailheads are 10-15 mins driving distance from me so that is perfect for a quick hike/run and when I have more time it's nice to drive out a little further and try out some new trails. Some of the trails can get a little crowded on the weekends when the weather is nice, but I do a lot of my hiking/running at sunrise in the winter and in the afternoons in the Summer so I am usually all alone. :)

I don't usually write this sort of review but I am so livid. I am actually an RN who works in a high risk clinical area with infants so I understand how stressful things can get and I have great respect for others in the healthcare field. I am really disappointed and upset with the treatment my 13 month old daughter received at the East Valley Urgent Care. She had been ill with a fever of 102-103 F for 3 days. She was listless, had nasal and chest congestion and seemed to have trouble breathing. My husband took our daughter to the East Valley Urgent Care when we both felt like she needed to be checked out for her labored breathing. I told him to go to Phoenix Children's in large part because it is such a trusted children's facility. I was at work and called my husband to see how everything was going and he told me that they were checking my daughter for a UTI. I would understand that if it was  fever of unknown origin but my daughter had obvious symptoms of a respiratory infection. With the flu season being in full force I had wanted to make sure that she didn't have the flu or possibly RSV. They performed a straight catheterization on my 13 month old daughter not once but twice. They did not get a drop of urine. They waited and wanted to attempt a third time but I told my husband absolutely not. My husband had to hold down my daughter while she was catheterized for a cough, congestion, runny nose, and fever. Like I previously stated, I am an RN and I understand the need to run tests to rule out possible health problems but I am absolutely livid that my daughter had to go through that. I know she won't remember and I know no real harm was done but if you have ever had a catheter inserted into your bladder you would know how very uncomfortable it is.My husband and daughter left the urgent care and my daughter had a full diaper of urine which leads me to believe that they were not placing the catheter in the appropriate place. I will not recommend this urgent care to my friends and family. I only wish I had been there so I could have prevented this from happening to my child.

This place is GREAT! I must have passed it a million times without knowing that it was tucked away in the complex. The sushi was awesome, the drinks were very reasonabally priced, we loved the decor and the atmosphere was very nice, kinda romantic if you are seated in the back away from the sushi bar. The service was great! We will definitely be going back.

I really love lifetime fitness. I have gone to my fair share of gyms. I wont lie, most of them ended up just randomly shutting down because they couldn't pay their bills! I am pretty cheap so I was leery about spending the money but my fiance assured me it was worth it. He was so right! I love this gym! I love the classes, they have like three spin classes a day which is nice. Everything is clean, everyone is so helpful and I never have to worry about it shutting down overnight.

I start at 40th st and Shea and I love this hike! This hike is HARD. I call it a sleeper hike, it starts off easy and then before you know it...BAM....it get's a little ridiculous. It will kick your butt but it's totally worth it.

My fiance and I have been  trying to find a sushi place in Chandler that measures up to Masa Sushi in Mesa! We have been to Mi Sushi a few times and the sushi is pretty good. We always get take out and this last time we were waiting and the chef sent over a plate of fruit for us! That was really nice! My only big complaint is that we will order a roll that doesn't mention anything being deep fried in the roll description(I am not into deep fried sushi) and one or two rolls always ends up having something fried in it. Not a huge deal, just a little annoying. The service was great and the atmosphere is nice. I would recommend it for sure.

I love Trader Joe's! This location is especially nice because it doesn't seem to get as crowded as some of the other locations (Tempe and Mesa). It's our go to place for wine, produce, meats, eggs, peanut butter, and then a bunch of other stuff that we end up randomly buying just to try out.

They have a great menu for lunch and for dinner! The pizza is so good and they offer a variety of healthy toppings. I also really like the salads, everything tastes so fresh. It gets busy sometimes, but they have a big patio if you don't mind enjoying the weather outside.

Best breakie/brunch food EVER! The food is great and the organic coffee is yummy. My Fiance and I are having our wedding at the Farm and specifically wanted a brunch wedding so that we could eat the yummy breakfast food.

My fave place on Mill Ave.They have great happy hour deals and it's fun to sit out on the patio and people watch.  The sangria is light and refreshing and I would definitely recommend the Mediterranean plate...it's delicious!

I can't say that I am a big fan of Salty's. I have been there a few times for happy hour and I just haven't been impressed. I don't like the margaritas. They are SOOOO sweet! The last time I was there I asked if they had Sangria, the waitress asked me if that was something that you eat or drink? Sigh. I do like the chips and guacamole! :) But sadly that is about it.

Hands down BEST sushi ever! We used to go to Masa weekly but then we moved to Chandler so we get out there much less often. We have been looking for a sushi place that measures up to Masa but can't find one!

This lake is fun and during the week it's nice and quiet. It's pretty close so it's the perfect place to go out on the boat and fish or catch some sun. My only warning is make a pit stop BEFORE you get there because the restrooms are horrific.

I have had such a wonderful experience with IrisD Bridal. I found the little shop by chance after hitting up David's Bridal and not even seeing a single dress worth trying on. Instantly I fell in love with the little shop. The gowns were so beautiful. I loved Kristen right away! She is so helpful! I told her what I was looking for and she pulled out the perfect dress. It was totally not what I had thought I would get, but I tried it on and I LOVED it. I never would have tried on a gown like that if it weren't for her suggestion. The dress was on sale and I felt like I was practically stealing it from them! The customer service continues to be awesome. I can't say enough wonderful things about this place!

This place is SO FUN! I took my fiance there for his birthday. We got the upgraded seats which were so worth it. We both had such a good time! The food was great and everything was so reasonably priced. We spent less on food and drinks than we would have if we had gone out to eat before the show.

Yum! We got a little flier put on our door alerting us that this place had opened right down the street. We kinda forgot about it, but one night we had a hankering for some pizza and I was too lazy to make it. I am very picky about pizza. It's gotta be a healthy crust, healthy toppings....pretty much an all around healthy pizza. This place was super yummy and the price was good too! We will def go there again!
