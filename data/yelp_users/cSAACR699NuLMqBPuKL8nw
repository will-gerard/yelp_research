This place is AMAZING. Seriously, I drive 35 minutes to come here because the owner is talented, fair, and fast. I brought in my favorite pair of shoes ever, a pair of Ted Baker bow flip flops that they no longer make.   One shoe broke at the toe connector. The first time he repaired them for me in 45 minutes and they lasted for 2 more months with almost daily wear. They broke again earlier this month and he was happy to repair them again (same day!) and they have still held up.   Nordstrom referred me to him and I can see why. I would trust him with any pair of shoes I need repaired or refreshed. His prices are totally fair and the craftsmanship he displays is wonderful. So happy to have finally found the best shoe repair in Phoenix! Thank you Central Shoe Repair!

Terrible customer service.   1.) I went to return something I bought online. The guy was irritated I didn't print out my order confirmation even though I had the packing slips. He repeatedly told me how much longer it takes him to complete the return. I offered to look up the confirmation in my email but he said that wouldn't work because he can't scan it through my phone -- uh really? Starbucks scanners work just fine if you have a digital gift card.   I didn't mind waiting the extra 5 minutes it took him to complete the return but he had no problem repeatedly telling me what an inconvenience I was.   2.) I needed help getting a shower head to fit. The first guy was nice but wasn't sure so he referred me to someone else. That guy was rude, condescending, and short. I though Home Depot was supposed to be helpful?   3.) I went to pay and then leave and remembered I parked on the other side of the store. I paused for a second to determine what the best way to exit the store would be (not in the way of anyone, just literally stepped away from the register after paying) and some guy asked me if I had a problem? Uh? I can't just stand here, receipt in hand, for 1 minute?   Will not return to this location.

Food here is mediocre and tastes super artificial. I ordered the turkey club thinking I couldn't go wrong but it was pretty gross. The meat tasted cheap and the bread had little flavor, pretty hard to do with herb cheese focaccia bread. Same goes for the tortilla soup, tasted like cornmeal.   The decoration of CPK is okay but it kind of feels like an Ihop.   Service was good, though.   Won't be back.

Ugh. I don't like Ulta and I am especially annoyed with this location.   The layout is terrible and they are always out of everything! Seriously. I went in yesterday looking for Burberry Brit (entirely gone) and their fragrance section looked like a tornado hit it -- boxes and bottles everywhere -- and it was clear they were not in the middle of restocking the shelves.   The service is better here than the one in North Scottsdale meaning I asked for help looking for an item and actually received help -- but the layout is enough to keep me away. Too bad it's so close to my house.

Great location and wide variety of toys, leashes, and costumes. Seemed to have a much larger stock selection than PetsMart over at the Promenade in North Scottsdale.

This is a great alternate to a place like Red Robin: it's super casual and fun with pretty good food.   I usually just get your basic cheeseburger and it tastes less dried out than Red Robin. The service is great and always friendly and fast. I do love their french fries and seasoning. Had the onion rings for the first time and those were definitely a repeat order.   Cool vibe with surfing and wakeboarding videos playing. Great for families and kids.

I will ONLY go to Harkins theaters and this one is the best yet. Harkins has fresh popcorn and yummy butter flavoring, kind employees, and super clean theaters. AMC on the other hand as rude workers, dirty carpet, old theaters, and GROSS popcorn. Even the super comfy AMC seats can't entice me. It's Harkins all the way.  This theater is super big and I never wait more than 5 minutes for concessions no matter how long the line is -- they have like 10 concession counters. Of course it is movie theater pricing ($6 for a bottle of water) but Harkins has a loyalty program: if you buy their reusable plastic cup for like $6 you can get refills for $1 all year. I'm in. If you really want to show off you can get a Harkins t-shirt and if you wear it you get a free medium popcorn.   I go to the movies a lot and this would save me money but I don't want to wear the shirt. Some people do though, more power to them.  Bathrooms are always spotless.  Great location next to many restaurants and causal dining places.   LOVE HARKINS

Great location, lots of gas pumps.   Easy to get in-and-out of: right off the 101, about 30 seconds west of the freeway.  I only go to Chevron and this is where I go besides the one on Scottsdale Rd and Bell.

This place is fantastic!!!  I just picked-up several items for both my boyfriend and I which included his dress shirts/pants, casual shirts, a very expensive tie with an oil or grease stain, my sweaters that have been schlepped from floor to floor and had lint all over them, and a favorite shirt that was looking a bit worn. The total came to $70 for all ten items and included two seaters that needed significant de-pilling and one that needed an alternation.  I believe I spoke with Geralyn when I first came in on Tuesday. I told her I was new to their place but had heard great things. She took the time to go through each item and let me know which service -- Diamond or Silver -- would be best. I thought for sure she would say "oh Diamond for everything" to make more money. Nope. She even said that some items don't need Diamond especially since the designer tag will increase the price 20%-50%. I appreciated her honesty: she seems to care about the quality of the work over the price, meaning if she thinks the item will fantastic with the cheaper option she won't recommend the Diamond to you.   All of the clothes look BRAND NEW. I am amazed at not only the friendly service and attention to detail paid to each item when I dropped off my clothes, but the quality of work here is fantastic. My sweaters look as if I just bought them a month ago. I could literally see the difference just by looking at the clothes through the bag. My boyfriend tried on his polos and said he noticed a difference.  I also love their automated valet system. It is only available for Diamond and Silver level items but I was able to pick-up my stuff after dinner last night to wear this weekend without have to make a separate trip like I usually have to with other dry cleaners.  Yes, this place is more expensive but I didn't find their pricing exorbitant. A Hugo Boss dress shirt with the Diamond level was $4. A Burberry tie with a stain was $7. You might pay $3+ more an item but the quality is so worth it, especially if you have designer labels. Those pieces are an investment so when you use a great dry cleaners your clothes will last longer and look great for months. If I had known the work here was so amazing -- and not been scared away by all these reviews of insane pricing -- I would have come here a long time ago. It's not like Z's charges $20 an item that elsewhere costs $4 or $6.

This is your typical large-scale chain American food restaurant that wins on customer service and consistency. A bonus is the portion sizes are large enough for two meals and their amazing desserts.   All the pasta dishes are great -- if you love bacon try the Pasta Carbonara. It's my go-to dish here for the moment. My pass favorites include Chicken Bellagio and the chicken alfredo with sun dried tomatoes.   I've had a few sandwiches here -- the club and the cheesesteak. I don't really like the cheesesteak, it just doesn't have that delicious steak and cheese combination flavors like Corleones. However, the club is one of my favorite club sandwiches found anywhere and it's particularly good on a really hot Arizona day with an iced tea or a coke.   The service is always great -- friendly and personable -- and they seem to have the timing down of when to check-up on the table.  One of my favorite things about the Cheesecake Factory is their hours: they are open super late for the area, 11:00PM on weekdays and 12:00AM Thursday through Saturday.   One downside is I really don't like their alcoholic drinks. They are really strong (as in not blended right) and taste like they use super cheaper liquor.   Oh and breakfast: not good here. I had the breakfast sandwich made with french toast and bacon. It sounded amazingly delicious but it was so gross I didn't even want to it. Something about cheese and french toast just didn't go together well for me.   This a great place for two people or large groups. Bear in mind the noise level can be a bit loud so come later in the day if you want a quiet meal.

This Petsmart location has been my dog's grooming location since he was a puppy. I usually schedule with Kendra because she is super nice and really fast -- and of course does a great job. Plus, she gives me these report cards that tells me just how wonderful and cute my dog is which I absolutely love -- I actually save them because I'm just that sentimental about my child, err dog, Toby.   I usually do the "teddy bear cut" and most of the time my dog looks super cute although sometimes he doesn't look as cute -- but hey, I think perfection is a little tough given the hours and exhaustion these groomers face. My dog has never looked bad or been given the wrong cut as others have mentioned. They will also make any corrections you want and they ask you if your dog looks the way you want it -- great customer service.   I do have one concern though -- the last few times my dog has been scared to go here, like holding onto to me tight scared. I don't know why and I don't know if something happened to him, he might just be nervous around other dogs -- he did get into a small scuffle around the same time at our residence. So IN NO WAY am I pointing the finger at this Petsmart and in all honesty I'd be really surprised if it was linked to them. This place is clean and all the groomers seem super nice and the dogs seem to be in good spirits.   However, I may need to find another groomer just because I'm concerned about my dog being so skittish the last few times.   If you do go here, ask for Kendra. She is always fantastic. Oh and a bonus: they can usually accommodate any scheduling needs you have from early morning to late afternoon.

Such a great North Scottsdale gem.  Everything is delicious but especially breakfast. The breakfast burritos here -- uhh max burrito with bacon = eggs, potatoes, bacon is such a great hangover food. The croissant with ham or sausage and egg is greasy but oh so good. (It's really greasy, it soaks through the paper bag).  Love this place and the owner. If you're not from the East Coast, don't be offended when he's short. It comes off rude to us in the Southwest and West Coast but it's just his NY swagga.

I have dropped A LOT of money at this location and sadly, feel as though it was a waste -- I should have spend the money at Sephora.   To put it into perspective, I think I dropped like $1000 here last year between buying a Sedu flat iron and a Sedu hair dryer along with mass amounts of fake eyelashes, lotions and body washes, hair spray, makeup, perfumes, etc. (Hey, have you BEEN to Old Town lately...a gir's gotta do her best to look good!)  For all the money I've spent I received a few 20% off coupons which happen to show up in my inbox a few days after I leave Ulta spending $50-$80. I would be relatively happy with their loyalty program only to find out my 20% coupon is heavily restricted: anything premium or as they say "prestige" is off limits. This is like EVERYTHING in the store. Why would I go to Ulta for lip gloss or primer I can find at CVS? I go to Ulta because of things like Anastasia tweezers and brow gel and Smashbox primer...now all of which are ineligible for my rare 20% coupon -- which lasts for no more than 5 days. Ugh.  And I confess -- a total first world problem -- but it was a painful realization that Sephora offers points for each dollar you spend and if you spend $350 or more you like a VIP member that gets more samples or something and if you spend $500 or more you can redeem those points for actual products.   What have I been doing shopping at Ulta the past two years? Where did I go wrong? Why did no one led me to Sephora? That's it, I refuse to grieve over Ulta and I officially  force myself into the acceptance phase of this process.   I agree with the others: the layout of this store is a nightmare. I always spend like an hour in here for 3 products because everything is either messy or just difficult to find. (And don't even try the Ulta on Tatum, that place is a nightmare maze of a store).  I'm done with Ulta for the most part. They still carry the Eylure eyelashes which I love -- although they are usually out of stock one almost all styles. If I find Sephora carries eyelashes than it's goodbye for sure.

Furniture shopping is supposed to be fun and after finally being able to afford something that isn't at Walmart or a hand-me-down, I was looking forward to it.  Thanks Ashley for making it a painful and stressful process.   I originally reviewed Yelp! and several of the typical AZ chain stores websites (Room Store, Mor, Ashley, etc.) Ashley seemed to have the best options (but no pricing) so I went there first. Ugh. Big mistake.   First off--they have A MILLION sales people there who creepily stalk you from the MOMENT you get in the door. You end up walking around the store trying to avoid the guys/girls in black shirts who continually ask you if you need help and try to sell the furniture. (Um, yeah, thanks but it doesn't matter to me if this piece is your favorite or what warranties it comes with...I need to measure and visualize this piece in my home which only I can do, hopefully undistributed...) It's WORSE than buying a car. It makes you want to leave the store but you can't because you need/want furniture...  I did like a few of their dining room tables and couches but everything was SO expensive. Like, overpriced expensive. I don't mind paying more for quality or customer service but I just felt like I was getting ripped off every minute I was there. However, at the end of the day I walked away with a table in mind and went home to confirm measurements.   I ended up checking a few more stores to make sure it was "the one" and I actually found one that I liked WAY better and was $150 cheaper at Mor (with NO pushy salespeople).  Oh, and they don't include measurements on the item tag...I think this is ploy to make you talk to a sales rep because they all carry tape measures but they only let you borrow it while they linger around and watch you take measurements, talking the ENTIRE time  Bottom Line: Ashley's stuff is fine and you can probably find something you like and want to buy, but their sales approach and prices aren't worth it--shop around. The furniture stores I visited after Ashley (Razmataz, Mor, random other stores, had NORMAL sales people who asked you once if you needed help and then left you alone).

It's Olive Garden: they thrive on consistency, friendly service, and value -- and this location is no exception. Our server was super nice and got the timing of our Toscana soup refills just right. The food was pretty good. I always like Olive Garden for causal dining. And of course, the mints at the end of the meal are yummy. Some servers surprise you with a handful of mints -- not this time but no complaints here since they are probably not "allowed" to dole out more than one per customer.

The Melting Pot does not serve gourmet food but you will pay gourmet prices. There profit margins must be pretty high here but in all honesty this is a wonderful place for a relaxing, more upscale restaurant. If you are looking for a perfect date restaurant this is it.  Lots of booths and a fireplace make the meal. They have private booths with curtains that shut out the outside world but they are super crammed. I'm claustrophobic and hated it. However, if you want to get super cozy go for it...  Reservations are strongly encouraged even when it's slow -- I think it's just how they roll. I've never had a problem getting a reservation during normal times to go. Stay away from this place on Valentine's Day. It will be packed (not romantic) and cost you a fortune. Spend that money on TRUE gourmet food.  Great wine selection with an expert to help you pick out what you want.  Why is the food bad? Well it's not bad. The cheese fondues and desserts are AMAZING. But the entrees are really pricey ($30 per person) and it's nothing special. They just bring you out the raw steak, chicken, or shrimp. Part of the reason you pay so much money for steak at higher end restaurants is the expert seasoning and grilling of the chef.   Also, I really dislike their dinnerware: cheap, scratched plastic plates -- feels like camping gear. For that reason it's not five stars and really not worth the price. I go here because I accept the Melting Pot's faults and cannot escape cravings for their delicious cheese fondue, scrumptious desserts, and lovely atmosphere.   Service is always amazing.  It's not really a good restaurant for kids. The can burn themselves on the fondue plate which is on the center of the table and it's really quiet in here so please only bring your kids if they are typically quiet at dinner.

Oreganos is a fun restaurant and their food is pretty yummy. Portion sizes are Cheesecake Factory style -- enough to share or to take home for another filling meal.   However, the restaurant is really dirty and for this reason I cannot give it more than two stars.  I have been to this location many, many times. More than 20. Each time I go there are flies EVERYWHERE. Even our server was embarrassed and tried to explain why there were flies (apparently it's because I was wearing perfume) and lit candles at 2:00PM to "attract" the flies. I spent most of my meal batting flies away from my food and hair. So gross.  After looking around for to figure out WHY there were flies I noticed just how filthy the restaurant is: there are splatters of what I assume is food on the blinds and a build up of what look like years of crumbs on the window sills, especially in the corners. (The booths that line the walls are next to windows). It was so gross I wouldn't have wanted to touch the blind cord to open the shades without a Clorex wipe. Ew. I can't believe that this popular of a restaurant doesn't take the time to wipe down their windows -- even just once a month.  I honestly don't think I will be back here anytime soon. I need to forget how grossed out I am before venturing back to this place. It very well could be that the flies were attracted to my perfume but if that's the case why am I never bothered by flies any where else?  On a positive note the service was great.   Seriously, just clean the place and find a way to fix the fly issue.

AMAZING. Really.   I just saw Shay for a cut and she was absolutely fantastic. You must see her! My boyfriend also goes to Aura and sees Kelly and always loves his hair. But back to Shay.   So, I met her and sat down she spent a good 15 minutes on my consultation. It was great and made me feel instantly comfortable and assured I was in good hands. I brought in a few pictures and we talked about what I saw and wanted and she gave me her opinion on if I wanted to tweak the picture a bit.   Then Ally washed my hair and applied a conditioning treatment ($15 but SO worth it. My hair feels amazing). She gave me most relaxing scalp and neck massage. She was polite and made conversation but not fake. I ended up just wanting to sit and relax and not chat much and she totally picked up on that. Some places feel forced to make conversation and it ends up not being that relaxing. I really wanted to tip her but I didn't have any cash on me. The shampoo/conditioner treatment was THAT good. She also didn't ruin my make-up at all.   Shay then cut my hair with precision and styled it perfectly. It is EXACTLY what I wanted. I mean 150%. It looks better than I expected. And I have never had that feeling leaving a salon after getting my hair done for 12+ years. Usually the cut is pretty close or the styling is off and I have to go home and flat iron my hair again because the stylist left pieces frizzy. I don't think I am that particular but I think some stylists try to rush after the cut to get to their next client or just to be done.  Nope. Shay did a perfect job. I felt like I could walk out and leave for a night out.   She also did a dry cut on my hair (after styling) so she could make my hair even more perfect. She told me she dry cuts so that it looks exactly the way it should when styled the way I normally do. Makes sense, but no other stylists I've been to did that. (And I'm not talking a trim after a flat-ironing my hair, I mean she spent another 20 minutes going through it).   She also does color and throughout the cut we talked about my color options and what I was unhappy with. I told her about a horrible experience I had with another salon in the area (who shall remain nameless but they only have one review this year and it's NOT good *hint hint*) She explained to me what probably went wrong at the other salon and what needs to be done in the future. She was understanding and empathetic about my experience and NOT FAKE. She also didn't talk about "next time we can fix the color..." it was nice because she wasn't being fake or pushy just to try to get me for more money. She was just giving me her opinion and I could do with it what I wanted. Much appreciated.  Even after the cut we spent another 5-10 minutes talking about the color (I kept bringing it up, they are SO not pushy on products and services) and she brought out swatches to show me. I have never done this before but I made my next appointment right then.   PROS:   - great location. there is a Chipotle, Aj's, Starbucks, nail salon, and Chinese restaurant all in the complex. So it has everything you need. It's also easy to get in and out of the parking lot (although if you make your appointment between 11am and 2pm it may be packed due to the lunch rush).    - great salon. it is small but you only notice it when you walk-in. i've been to other salons that are much bigger but once you're in the chair you have just as much space as other places.   - NOT PUSHY. you can buy if you want, no one pushes products or services. they stock Kerastase and Bumble and Bumble.   - Friendly. Everyone there was super nice and genuine.   - Pricing is fair and reasonable. I spent over $400 for a cut/color and at the salon that shall remain nameless and usually spent about $250+ at places like Rolfs and Mane Attractions  CONS:  - none!!  Recommendations:  See Shay. I think her cuts are a bit pricer (she's one of the top stylists) and it was like $70 for the cut. (I was referred to the salon by my bf so I saved $20). if someone else refers you you both get $20 off.   If her prices are a bit too much see Kelly. I think she charges around $50 (that's what my boyfriend pays, not sure if men's haircuts are different but his hair always looks great). But you can always call and get pricing. They told me the price for my next appointment upfront ($150 for an allover color and cut).  Final Notes:  I've been to Dolce Salon & Spa (Yuck) , Rolfs (Meh) , Mane Attractions (Good), and Fate Image since I've moved to Arizona seven years ago and this was BY FAR the best experience I have ever had. Honestly, I had GIVEN UP on finding a good place. Rolfs is super expensive and super snobby. It's not even that relaxing. Mane Attractions was fine but I haven't been there in about 5 years and the Biltmore area is a pain to drive to.   It was down to Aura or Jo Paris but I didn't want to drive to Old Town since I live 2 minutes for Aura.   GO TO AURA.

I usually see Shay for a haircut and color every 6-8 weeks. This month she was booked solid for some vacay time and I asked the receptionist -- Courtney -- who she recommended. She set me up with Berri.   It was nerve-wracking to go someone other than my usual stylist but she did a fantastic job. The cut was exactly what I asked for and she styled it perfectly. I have no problem seeing her for my hair if Shay is unavailable. Plus, she was super fast. Cut and style in about 45 minutes.   Go to Aura. This is the third stylist I've seen (Shay for my regular style, Bellan for night out makeup and hair, and now Berri) and they are all fantastic.   I can't imagine going anywhere else. Thank you to the fabulous staff and stylist team at Aura.

I love Harkins and this one feels like an old family member as in it actually smells musty in here -- always -- but the staff are always friendly and the popcorn is fresh. The movie theater doesn't have stadium style seating which sometimes is a plus for more relaxed days at the movies.   However, I would not recommend seeing a new release here as it is much smaller and will be much less comfortable, it's hard to find seats in the dim lighting when all the seats are on such a slight downward gradient.   I go to Shea when there is an older movie I want to see that Harkins 101 either isn't playing or has like 2 really inconvenient showings.

I found this place on Yelp after my 3-year-old Maltese was bitten by a pit-bull puppy on his nightly walk. He was shaken and had blood on his face but no visible bites. I didn't want to take any chances so I quickly pulled up Yelp and after calling to confirm I could bring him right in, drove to the clinic.   It was a bit hard to find -- directly across (eastward direction) from Sauce -- but I might have just been too shaken. The vet tech behind the desk was kind and gently took him in the back room. After about 5 minutes, the vet -- Dr. Simpson -- and the vet tech came out with great news. He said he found no visible bite marks or spots where my dog appeared to be in pain. He said he was very confident my dog was not injured and either the blood was from the other puppy's teething or my dog bit the puppy. (The puppy had no blood or marks on her). So, what a relief! I thanked the vet and he explained they clinic was open all-night if we took him and something came up. He was SO kind and professional.   I walked up the desk to turn in my patient/owner paperwork and expected to pya the $95.00 visit fee. Even though the vet only spent 5 minutes, given that it's an emergency clinic I just figured I'd owe the charge for the brief exam. The vet tech smiled and said there was no charge! I couldn't believe it! I know he didn't do a "compete exam" but he still could've charged me for his time and the visit.   I hope I never need to go to an emergency vet again, but if I do I will certainly go to Emergency Vet Clinic.   They have terrible reviews on Google but I'm not sure why.   Thank you DR.SIMPSON!

I stopped here on a Friday morning around 11:00AM and it wasn't too busy. Food was absolutely delicious but it is a bit pricey -- although worth it. The orange juice was the BEST I have ever had but it was $4 a glass (no free refills). I had the steak & eggs which came with fresh fruit and potatoes. Everything was super yummy. Will definitely be going back. For two people it was about $50-$60 ($16 of that were drinks).

After this place, Tryst Cafe, and Desert Sage, the Breakfast Club in Old Town is still hands down the BEST breakfast place. I keep trying other places but cannot find a closer alternative.  The best blubbery and chocolate chip pancakes anywhere and the OJ is AMAZING. Best combination of sweet and cold. Service is alway fast and friendly.

I went to Designer Art Direct based on the great reviews I read about them on Yelp! After completing the framing process with Carol and Cindy at Designer Art Direct, the Yelp! reviews are spot on -- this is a great place: great quality work with kind and helpful employees.  I walked into the store with a general idea of what I wanted -- one frame for two diplomas along with two corresponding academic medals -- with some type of mat. I showed up to Designer Art Direct on June 30, 2012, a Saturday afternoon, and was immediately greeted and helped. Carol took me behind the counter to the large workstation and both listened and helped me figure out what would look best. She is clearly an expert at what she does but is not pushy at all -- a great guide.   We didn't discuss pricing as we picked out mats and selected a frame since the items are very important to me and I was willing to splurge. However, I have no doubt if I had a specific budget to work within Carol would have been just as helpful and kind.  They honored a 50% discount from Yelp! and a separate $50 off for checking-in through Yelp.   The total came to around $750 and with the discounts and tax I paid $360. Now, this seems expensive to me but I have no idea what to expect with the cost of professional framing -- especially given the slightly more difficult job I had with the medals. If you read through all the reviews on Yelp! -- even the filtered ones -- the overwhelming consensus is that Designer Art Direct is very competitive on price. I think professional framing is just expensive in general. Also, Carol and Cindy (the owner) are so nice that if you do have a strict budget I am sure they will do their best to accommodate your budget.   The project was ready a week later and it looks PHENOMENAL. It is absolutely exactly what I envisioned. I selected two different mat colors and Cindy found the best balance between the two colors. Everything is even and meticulously completed. So even though it was more expensive than I predicted it is WORTH it for the quality of work.   FYI: They do not accept AMEX.  I will most certainly return for future framing needs.   Thank you DESINGER ART DIRECT!

I've purchased a few bags here and the experience is always wonderful. I was just recently helped by Jackie and she was so nice, friendly, helpful, and professional.   I came in on Wednesday looking for the Neverfull MM Damier Ebene but wasn't sure if I wanted the GM instead. (I had called earlier to confirm they had the MM and coincidentally spoke with Jackie who was so nice and confirmed they did have the MM in Damier Ebene in stock).   Jackie helped me look at the two bags, fill up the MM with wallets so get a better idea of the weight and was not pushy in any way. I would love to work with her in the future for any additional purchases I make here.  I transferred my purse items into my new Neverfull MM -- the GM was GIANT -- and she still gave me a box and giant LV shopping bag.   Wonderful experience. I came in just before close, like 20-30 minutes I think, but usually they offer you champagne or water when you are in the middle of a intense shopping excusion here :) I spent maybe 15 mins in the store but I'm sure if I had been browsing more I would have been offered my choice of beverages.   All in all a WONDERFUL experience and thank you Jackie for all of your help!

I should preface this review by stating I am forever a Nordstrom customer. I grew up shopping predominantly at this department store -- exceptions for Saks and Neimans -- and since I grew up in Seattle I grew accustomed to the epitome of customer service at Nordstrom.   This Nordstrom is great but the customer service at times can be lacking. That in no way implies poor or even mediocre customer service, but from shopping at the Nordstrom in Seattle or even in Bellevue, the Scottsdale Fashion Square Nordstrom can be a little snobby. Though it just might be the difference in culture.   I like to shop in casual attire: yoga pants, yoga sweatshirt, flip flops. I don't look sloppy -- never anything baggy or worn out and my yoga gear is quite expensive -- but I find that at this Nordstrom I need to forgo my yoga pants to receive better service. That is a detail I would expect to find at Saks or Neimans, I would never walk into Saks in yoga wear. "Better" service is also relative. Only a few occasions have I felt I received poor service and that was during an especially busy time when the store was in the process of a massive remodel.   This Nordstrom is fairly large: 3 stories and a FANTASTIC shoe department. The men's section is better than other stores but still lacking. My boyfriend has trouble finding stuff he likes because tend to carry the exact same stuff for months at a time. Also, the men's section is a bit too trendy for me. Wait too much emphasis on the "Scottsdale" look. However, most of the gems in my boyfriend's closet are from Nordstrom. Great jean selection but go elsewhere for men's shoes (check Hugo Boss).  The beauty and fragrance sections are wonderful but beware the MAC counter -- always insane. One thing I dislike about browsing the beauty counters at Nordstrom and perhaps anywhere is the hard sell. I never really feel comfortable just perusing the products. However, I do recognize that makeup has a really high return rate so I get the need for the retail push.   My favorite section is Activewear. I tend to be more causal most of the week since I'm a freelancer and I love their selection of comfy yet super stylish yoga and workout gear, plus they have their in-store brand called Zella which is like Lululemon but with a better variety of sizes. (You never want to stuff yourself into yoga pants a size too small...)  As usual, there are no pushy sales reps at Nordstrom. They ask you if you need help and then let you browse if you say no. Even today -- I was considering a new wallet and the associate was helpful but left me alone for 10-15 minutes while I contemplated my purchase. I love that about Nordstrom, I never feel pressure to buy anything.   Ohhh I almost forgot to mention the cafe. Yum! I love Nordstrom Cafes and the service and selection is delicious. I absolutely love their salmon cesar salad with an iced tea.   There is also a coffee bar on the first floor and an AMAZING sunglass department next door. I found my one and only Chanel shades here after swearing for years I'd never drop major money on sunglasses.   All in all: Nordstrom never fails to impress with service or style. I prefer Nordstrom over Saks or Neimans -- just a more comfortable experience.

Neiman Marcus is a great addition to my shopping go-to locations like Nordstrom, and well, Nordstrom. I usually only shop at Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, sometimes Saks.  Anyway. Neiman Marcus has impecable customer service but know that you kind of need to "dress up" to shop here. At least I feel uncomfortable if I come in in yoga gear. The selection is a nice compliment to Nordstrom -- much more tailored and designer specific. My boyfriend loves their men's section.   I love their selection of Chanel handbags and other great purses. Plus, the layout of the store is just luxurious and calming. They don't carry MAC here but I love the Chanel, Christian Dior, and Laura Mercier counters.   My ONLY complaint is their hours. Ugh. They close at 7 Monday through Saturday and 5 on Sunday. It's an hour earlier than the rest Scottsdale Fashion Square so there have been many times where I've trekked from Nordstrom to Neimans only to find they are closed.   If you don't want to go through the mall there is complimentary valet at Neimans. You can park in their private lot but it's on a hill and narrow so if I'm feeling rushed I just valet....but I'm also not the best at parking.  NOTE: the only credit card they accept is AMEX. Otherwise it's cash or check. That's right, no Visa, no Mastercard

This is one the best malls I have been to out of my travels to Seattle, Bellevue, Boca Raton, and West Palm Beach.  In the last few years several major designer stores have opened: Prada, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Hugo Boss, Barney's, Ted Baker, St. John, etc.   If you need to shop and you are looking for an upscale experience, this is it.   This mall is massive and I consistently go to a few stores: Ted Baker, Nordstrom, and Neiman Marcus.   There is a great food court as well as restaurants in the mall like Yard House and Kona Grill. Oh, yeah, and Modern Steak recently opened which looks delicious (it's a Sam Fox restaurant).   Valet at every entrance I think and there is always a ton of parking available. There is giant parking garage right across from Nordstrom.   Scottsdale Fashion Square will spoil you and tempt you to spend more than you can afford.

This is a great bbq place and the service is always fantastic -- thanks "Famous Jim!" I love bbq and I really haven't found any comparable place. The have a great menus and my favorite meat is the brisket, so tender and yummy with their "sassy" bbq sauce. Also, they have paper towels and wetwipes at the table which is a big plus.   I don't live near this location but whenever I'm in the Chandler area I certainlty have this on my list of lunch/dinner places. Just be prepared to want to go to bed after you eat :)

Ah Chipotle, you lure me in with your cilantro-lime rice and woo me with your guacamole. I'm such a fan of the burrito bowls but hate the burritos -- too much tortilla ruins the flavor for me. Great and fast service.   Drink area is in a bit of an odd place and this location is PACKED at lunch -- avoid this area if you can between 12:00PM and 1:00PM Monday-Friday.

I love this theater because it shows indepedent films -- often movies that are fantastic but overlooked in larger theaters -- and it's still a Harkins so $1 drink refills on my yearly loyatly cup and yummy popcorn.   CONS - mostly small theaters so they tend to fill up quick. I arrived a half an hour early on Saturday and the theater was in theater 5, their smallest one, which only has 50 seats with over 70% full.  - No Icees if you're a fan of those.

The food here is fantastic but the service leaves a lot to be desired. It's such a shame given the wonderful, inviting atmosphere and delicious food.  My boyfriend and I went here last Friday -- 08/24/12 -- around 8:00PM and from the start it was a disaster. We asked to wait for a booth and the hostess said she wasn't sure how long it would be and that most of the guests in booths at already been at the restaurant for 2+ hours. It was totally not a problem that she didn't know and I appreciated her honesty.   After 20-30 minutes -- and seeing a booth remain empty for at least 10 minutes -- the hostess then goes up to a group next to my boyfriend and I and asks, "Were you guys waiting for a booth?" They nodded. I was confused because the hostess did not tell us that there was a group in front of us waiting for a booth. My boyfriend said it sounded like the hostess forgot who was waiting. This irritated me since we were waiting for so long. However, I did not want to make a scene and decided to just wait for another booth. Another 10-15 minutes goes by and we finally were seated.   The server -- Kyle -- takes awhile to come by and take our drink order, I think about 10 minutes. When he does finally come by we wait another 10-15 minutes for our drinks and several more minutes for bread. We order our entrees and hope for the service to improve. Nope. Everything took several minutes (10-15 minutes) for drink refills and I think about 20-25 minutes for our food. No wonder people are here for hours. They didn't seem that busy but I also don't know how a restaurant operates so I don't want to make the assumption that service absolutely should have been faster. All I know is that it took forever and even though I asked for a drink refill twice it never happened. I gave up. Didn't even want to stay for dessert because I knew it would take forever.   I really thought our food was delicious and for that reason I will be back but plan to wait, and wait, and wait.

Was here again last night and both the service and the food were amazing. The waiter so so kind and had perfect timing on drinks, bread, etc. I think my experience written up in the last review was likely just an off-night for the restaurant or server.  Last night was a totally different experience and it was the dinner rush, we stopped in at 7:30PM.   I ordered the carbonara with chicken instead of lobster -- just not a fan of seafood and pasta -- and it was amazingly delicious.   I also really love their bread and butter. The bread is soft and fresh and the butter is room temperature (it's kind of a pet peeve of mine when butter is served cold).   Yummy Italian food!

I was here last night after the bars closed in Old Town. I was thrilled to know there's a place to grab food late besides typical fast food and Philadelphia Sandwich is open 24 hours!.   This place is yummy. I had a cheesesteak with onion rings and it was really good (and I wasn't drunk so my tastebuds were operating under fairly normal conditions).   There were a ton of people milling inside so I figured it would take some time to get my food--nope, I waited maybe 5 minutes.  The food itself was great, I doubt you'd be disappointed with anything on the menu. It all looked good.  I'll go back next time I'm in Old Town and craving a cheesesteak. The onion rings were okay--I'd still order them again but Corleones has THE BEST onion rings in my opinion so there's some tough competition. Hmmm...there is just something about the way cheeseteaks and onion rings go together.   Oh, and I'm not sure if they do this all the time but they had a DJ playing awesome music SUPER loud. I felt bad for the people sleeping in the surrounding hotels but it was fun for us in the restaurant.  Everyone was dancing in the middle of the restaurant so that was an added bonus.

After a horrible experience at Ashley, Mor saved the day.  1.) The opposite of pushy sales people. They kindly answer your questions and can take a hint when they need to walk away. I spent an hour debating over a couch and was left alone for most of the time (which is what I wanted).  2.) Great selection at a variety of price levels. I found several pieces I liked. The couch I purchased was actually $1000 cheaper at Mor than at other furniture (and yes, it's the EXACT same couch and was not on sale).   3.) Free popcorn, soda, cookies, water. It's nice.   4.) Delivery is overpriced. $100 each to deliver a table and couch. But it was seamless (and I was worried after reading some of the reviews here). The table was in stock and delivered next day and the couch was in the warehouse in San Diego--said it would take until Friday to be in AZ, I requested delivery on Sunday morning, and it was there on Sunday morning. Guys put the table together very fast and were careful not to damage anything (were also VERY nice and called when they were on their way).

This is my absolute favorite mexican restaurant in this area. The service is fantastic, the food is amazing, and the atmosphere is relaxing and upscale.  I have been here several times and never had to wait for a table -- the restaurant is huge.   I typically order the tableside guacamole which is hands down THE BEST guacamole  . It is expensive but they make a lot of it and it's absolutely delicious. Last night I ordered the queso with ground beef -- sooo yummy. My boyfriend and I ordered another round of chips just to finish it -- and we didn't even get close. It was so filling that by the time my entree came I was pretty full.  I always get the same thing here -- beef fajitas with no beans, extra rice, and a side of shredded jack cheese. The beef here tastes like pretty good quality and is flavored perfectly. They give you a lot of food. I usually have one fajita and take the rest home.  When I'm in the mood to drink I love their mojitos -- they are all amazingly good. A bit pricey but you get a huge, tall drink.   The only downside to Cantina Laredo is their dessert selection. I'm not a fan of any desserts they offer. However, my boyfriend loves the flan. He is from Argentina and says it's very well-done.

I've been to Prestige four to five times in the past six months and each time I've been really disappointed. The last time I dropped my clothes off there was the end of July and I've since switched to Mark's Cleaners on Shea (fantastic!). Really don't go here--there are way better options in the area.  I'm not really sure what the draw of this place is. At first, I thought it was price and convenience because that's what kept me from trying other businesses. They DO have your stuff done super fast (if you drop off before 11AM it's after 5PM same day.) And since they charged me about $10/item and this was the cheaper option I had researched, I didn't want to find out what the bill would be at other businesses with a known higher price tag--think Z's Cleaners. I just figured Prestige was the only place I could afford in the area since I get my stuff dry cleaned every month or so. I even tried to use their print-out coupons when I remembered.   However, my clothes were becoming increasingly worn out looking. This was a major red flag for me. Not supposed to happen with dry cleaning, right? The last straw: I had one brand new shirt come back looking as though I had put it through the washing machine. I was frustrated because it was the first time dry cleaning this item and they charged me around $10 for it (just a t-shirt but somehow the fabric can't be washed because it has a sheen to it). Anyway, I finally was too fed up to go back and felt like there HAD to be somewhere else that wouldn't cost me a fortune and did a great job. I was even willing to go to Z's and just pay the price because I felt my clothes were getting ruined and didn't feel clean.  Thanks to Yelp I came across Mark's on Shea. They restored my worn out clothes in one visit AND charged me half the price. I dropped my clothes off at 11:30AM and they were done the next day after 5PM.  Anyway, don't use Prestige. Your clothes and wallet will thank you.

I don't really fast food but I love the McDonald's hot fudge sundae. It's $1.30 and really hits the spot for something sweet.

I have been a client of McClintock Anima Care -- and Dr. Duplissis and Dr. Claus -- since I brought my puppy in at 4 months old back in 2009. How I have not yet written a review of this amazing practice escapes me...  This is a truly wonderful veterinary practice. The building is beautiful and extremely clean. It is a warm and inviting place -- an atmosphere that is very difficult to attain in a medical and especially a veterinarian practice. ALL of the staff not only love animals but they love their owners too (at least to their faces). I have never received anything less than absolute perfect customer service in the 3+ years that I've been a client.   One of the things I love most is that I can call if I have a question or a concern and I get an answer with honest feedback right away. Sometimes they suggest I bring my dog in, something they give me an at-home treatment plan. I never feel like McClintock Animal Care pushes me to get me in the door to spend money. They really just give their professional opinion. I have never felt like I was being "sold" on a procedure or process.   They also always call and check-up on my dog after a visit. Amazing. I really feel like they care about your animals total well-being and are dedicated to providing the best service.   I moved 35 minutes north of McClintock Animal Care back in 2010 and I still make the drive to bring my dog here. It's like a family that knows him. There are other vets that may be slightly cheaper but you'll definitely notice it in terms of customer service and the aesthetics of the practice. And McClintock Animal Care isn't pricey, it's still very competitive. Maybe you'll save $10-$20 going elsewhere but keep in mind the vet is often stressful and McClintock Animal Care  goes out of their way to make sure you-- and most importantly your pet -- are well-taken care of. I wish my doctor's office was this nice.   One thing that is a bit of a drawback is their limited hours. A few times I have gone to a nearby practice when I could not get off work before 6:00PM. However, McClintock does do their best to accommodate you if you are in a pinch with a inflexible schedule. There have been plenty of times when they have fit me in last minute.   Thank you so much McClintock Animal Care for taking care of my beloved only child -- my maltese Toby.

Update: I have now been a client of McClintock Animal Care for 4 years and absolutely would not take my maltese Toby to any other veterinarian practice.   I am honestly shocked at the review from "Kristin W" -- there is absolutely no way the McClintock Animal Care I know would be a part of such a horrific story.   McClintock Animal Care treats Toby and myself with the utmost compassion and care. All of the veterinarians and staff truly love animals. Every time I bring Toby they get down on the floor to play or cuddle him.   I have had two instances of Toby being in pain (due to a urinary infection) and Dr. Duplissis and the staff did everything to make Toby comfortable. They prescribed a pain medication and called to check on Toby frequently after we went home to see how he was doing.   In addition, I want to mention that the staff here truly knows my dog. Dr. Duplissis is familiar with Toby's history and so each time we come in we can have a helpful conversation about Toby's health -- what is going great, possible things to watch for in the future, if any current ailments are related, etc. When I thought about getting another dog, Dr. Duplisses gave me a lot of information about the best way to add a new dog.   The practice is spotless, welcoming, warm and efficient.   Also, they really do cater to your needs. I thought I might need to travel last minute with my dog and McClintock was able to get me all the paperwork I needed -- and even thought to check with the state of California for additional paperwork -- in about an hour. They even called my new groomer to find out what paperwork was needed when I brought him in later that day.   When my dog needed to go to the emergency vet, when I followed up with McClintock Animal Care they communicated with the emergency vet throughout the week to get the results of the labs that were due in later.   Please take this as someone who truly believes in the uniqueness of McClintock Animal Care. I have been to a few other vets in the area and continue to take my Toby here -- even driving about an hour each way -- because I am confident no other practice can take care of Toby as well as McClintock Animal Care.

I love this location. It is tucked away and surrounded by trees and hence shade and feels welcoming and inviting. The barista was super nice and made my large, iced hazelnut latte perfect. The store was very clean and just felt calm on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.

I love this place and it really is the only good Chinese restaurant in the area that's not super, super casual. (Asian Island is good but it is really casual).   Their won ton soup is so amazing and delicious. It is huge for $5. LOVE this soup.   I had the sweet and sour chicken and my boyfriend had the chicken katsu. The sweet and sour chicken was really good and "typical" flavors. The katsu was soo yummy I ate more of his than mine. I keep sneaking my fork onto the plate for some of that delicious rice. Katsu it is for me on our next trip to Flos.  It would be nice if the restaurant wasn't so modern looking, I love the traditional Chinese food places. The atmosphere is still really nice though so I can't fault them too much.

My favorite, favorite, favorite spot for a hazelnut latte. I was actually here twice today but Yelp wouldn't let me check-in again...  This place is what Starbucks used to be: friendly staff who make perfect, yummy drinks. It's a bit of a wait but they only have like 1 person working as a barista. Great atmosphere for talking and it smells so good in here, not like the dark dungeons of Starbucks.   No burnt coffee!!!  Only wish they had a drive-thru because yes, I am that lazy.

This is a cool place right in Old Town across from Kyoto Bowl and next to the Breakfast Club.  The food is absolutely delicious with a truly varied menu.   A note about ordering: So you order each burger individually by size (3 oz = slider, 6 oz = regular burger, 9 oz = GIANT burger). I order 3 different 3 oz sliders without any substitutions or additions: the Beef, the Short Rib, and the Sloppy Joe.  Al three were yummy. My favorite for a traditional slider was the Beef and my favorite in terms of flavor was the Short Rib.   I also ordered some regular tots to share and those were TOO good. They were fried to perfection. So good I ate way, way too many.   They also had tons of healthy options (hey, this is Old Town) so don't fret if your friends want to head to Stax and you're not feeling the carb heavy, deep fried lunch that day. I stole a peek at a few salads and they looked good. So if you have the discipline, by all means feel free to enjoy a salad.  Will definitely return. Nice patio area too. Only downside is it's a little small inside so when it's packed it could definitely feel claustrophobic.  Service was fine, not stellar and not bad.

I saw Samantha for a 50 minute hot stone massage and she was great. Very nice and seemed to know exactly what spots to hit and for how long to massage them.  The hot stone massage felt SO great. Some parts of the massage were painful but I was super tense and had some knots so getting through the pain for the 5 seconds she went over those spots was worth it--I feel super relaxed now (about an hour later). (Also, you can always tell them if it it really is too painful.) It was my first visit so I paid $75 (including 20% tip).   They offer you water at the end and it's either a bottle or a Styrofoam cup. I like lemon in my water so it would be nice if it was a glass and they gave you a few minutes to sort of "come back to life." You feel rushed out (not by Samantha, she told me to take my time after she was done) but you just get dressed and the leave the room, walk into the lobby, and pay.   The lobby is nice and relaxing, the room was pretty dark, and the music was good--classical piano. At times the music seemed kind of sad but that is a super picky point. I'm more of a person who likes to hear the sound of water or something and I'm sure for most people the music is fine.   TIPS:  Ladies put your hair in a bun or pony tail. I forgot and let my hair down and she got some lotion/oils on the bottom layers of my hair.   PROS:  They have a membership program ($50/month) that let's you enjoy one massage or facial (it's like $30 off list price) and also significantly discounts other services. This makes the spa actually a lot cheaper than other spas in the area. They also push you to buy their "wellness program."  CONS:  It feels like a chain, and for how expensive it is compared to other day spas in the area (if you pay per service), I don't think it's that great of a deal if you're not a member. Their prices are actually more expensive for some of their services than other spas that are much higher end.   BOTTOM LINE:  I probably won't go back here again. I feel like the $75 was kind of expensive for the total atmosphere. Samantha was great, her work was definitely worth what I paid, but when I go to the salon or spa I like to enjoy the whole experience. This place is really lacking in that department. I'm the kind of person who would rather spend a little bit more and get a lot out of the 1-2 hours than save $20-$30 and feel like I'm missing something.   However, if you need/want to get massages/facials/waxing often and can't afford to go to an upscale salon every month, then definitely go here. The $50 membership program seems super reasonable and you probably get a lot of out it--especially since other services are so heavily discounted.   I personally would rather get a massage every once in a while and save up and go somewhere really nice.

I love this place for a casual and delicious lunch. This location is super easy to find and has great customer service and food.   I've been to Sauce a few times (one at Fashion Square and the other at this location). Both times the food was great.   At this location, I ordered the pasta with red sauce and meatballs. It was a little plain but absolutely yummy--tasted very homemade and I would order again. I also had the bruschetta with feta cheese, also good. (See pics). We original ordered the bruschetta with a basil pesto sauce and the manager came over to tell us they were out of pesto. She apologized and even though we still had the bruschetta, just swapped out for a different sauce, she took the appetizer off our bill completely.  I've also tried the pesto chicken pizza on their super thin crust and a pepperoni pizza on regular crust. Really, really good. Although, I wouldn't go for the super thin crust, it was actually too thin.  The service is fast and everyone is also super nice.   This is my fourth FOX restaurant and I love all of them.

I had breakfast here on a Saturday morning in mid-August and it was fantastic. It is a resort -- so expect resort prices -- but the service and atmosphere were great. The food isn't really worth what they charge but our waiter was extremely attentive and the view out the windows of the gorgeous McDowell Mountains and palm trees was just super relaxing.   However, it is really expensive. My boyfriend and I both got the breakfast buffet ($25 each) and with tip and valet parking ($5) we spent like $80. I think it was worth the $80 but keep in mind the food itself is nothing spectacular.  You're really paying for a relaxing morning. The restaurant was empty at 11:00AM in mid-August even though the hotel itself was fairly busy.

I called Hugs N Pups after reading the fantastic reviews on Yelp. They are about 20 minutes from my house but after searching for weeks for a groomer with a stellar, consistant reputation, the distance didn't seem like an issue. I was looking for a wonderful place to bring my 3 year-old Maltese.   This place is it -- the dog grooming salon all pet owners search for but only hope to find one day.  The place is clean and friendly. If your dog is okay with other dogs they have them roam the salon behind the counter. It's safe for them and your dog doesn't have to be cooped up in a teeny tiny crate for hours before and after the groom.  The prices are extremely reasonable. They could charge $10 more and I'd still be totally happy.   THEY LOVE DOGS. These groomers don't seem like people who are just doing it as a job. They really love animals and it shows.  There is a cute gate in front of the entrance in case the door were to be left open your dog would be safe. (The door closes like a normal door so don't worry or anything).   My dog has never looked better after a groom. The groomer totally listened and took my incoherent "well, kinda long but I mean cut his har and we sort of like the teddy bear look" and did an absolute perfect job.  So happy to finally have found a regular grooming salon. Way better than PetsMart.  THANK YOU HUGS N PUPS!!!!

I stopped in here tonight after grabbing some pizza at Mellow Mushroom.   The shop is small but is nicely decorated -- definitely trendy. You walk in and it's all self-serve: you grab the size of container you want, pick your flavor, and then finish off your creation with a few of the standard toppings.   They didn't seem to have too many flavors: raspberry tart, vanilla, and something else -- helpful, right? So on that note you can't really get creative.   I had the "White Boy Vanilla" with peanut butter cups. Peanut butter cups were stale but the yogurt was delicious. Like I am going to come here tomorrow good.   I didn't run into the problems other have mentioned. The yogurt wasn't grainy for me and the service was just your usual "I work at a yogurt shop" service. The cashier wasn't overly nice or rude.   It was $5.00 for 16oz of vanilla.   I will be back....

I used to come here a lot when I lived in Tempe. It is one of my favorite places for a quick bite at Tempe Marketplace -- aka the new Desert Ridge.   The employees are always nice and even though I'm a bit picky with my order they have yet to make a mistake. I like how the drink/condiment section is set-up. Plus: the bathroom is spotless.  The food is kind of heavy before a movie -- at least for me -- but I like it for dinner or a late lunch and dinner, I think linner is what they call that meal...

Wow. What a cool and upscale pizza place!   If you want standard pizza and appetizers, then do not come here because this place is for those who crave a little extra. Creative and delicious pizzas (made with totally fresh ingredients) along with hardcore appetizers (do not expect your generic antipasto) make for a great dining experience.   I went for a quiet lunch during the day and the service and food were excellent. The pizza does take some time so if you have a limited time for lunch I would not recommend this place. You might be too rushed to enjoy the food.   At night this place seems like a fun, casual nightlife spot. Definitely a good choice if you're on a date.

I tried this place today for the first time through Yelp since I was craving hummus. I typed in hummus and first result was Pita Jungle. I tend to like Greek food so I ventured over and enjoyed a very pleasant lunch.  The atmosphere is super causal but stil a restaurant with a hostess and server. The prices don't reflect the atmosphere, it easily could $3-$4 more expensive.   Food is great. I ordered the beef and lamb gyro with mixed greens, onions, and that tzatziki sauce...ahh nom nom. The hummus like others have said is the best I have had.   Love that  I found a new lunch/dinner place. Thanks Yelp!

Love this place. Open late so I often stumble in here after the bars or on my way home from a late movie at Harkins Camelview. Yummy subs -- the hot subs are all delicious and you really can't go wrong. Friendly employees and fairly loud music playing, usually throwback hip-hop/rap.   My fav is the Tombstone (meatball) with just parm. cheese.   Open until 3AM every day.

The BEST place for cheesesteaks. Insane. And if you want cheesesteaks during 12:00PM and 1:30PM be prepared to wait but it's so worth it.   I usually get the large cheesesteak with provolone and onion rings. The sandwich is huge and enough for two meals for me. The onion rings are the best I've had but I'm not a fan of their fries -- although my friends rave about them.   This place gets packed during lunch hour and the Northsight area is already a mess during lunch hour. This place does delivery but there's a catch: they will take forever and your food will be cold. I don't think they take a long time because they're lazy, iI genuinely think it's because they are just so busy.   They do have pizza and I've heard it's great but I just can't pass up their cheesesteaks every time I go.   Most of the seating here is stools with pub-height tables and there are four booths.   I've never had any problems with consistency like others have mentioned but it can be pricey. Like $25-$30 for two people if you both get larges and combos (fries/onion rings and a regular drink).

I hired Just-in Time moving for a move from my 1,000 square foot apartment in North Scottsdale to my new place at CityNorth on May 21, 2012. This company and the crew -- Bobby, Jeff, and Daniel -- are wonderful and absolutely amazing. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them.   In short, Just-in Time was: ON TIME, PROFESSIONAL, COURTEOUS, FAST, WELL-PREPARED  Andy and I discussed the move over email when I filled out a contact form. He responded same day and was prompt with all future correspondence. Pricing was upfront -- I paid $103/hr for a 3-person crew which I believe is a discount since my move was scheduled for Monday: Monday through Thursday are discounted from $119/hr (I think) to $103/hr. There was also a one-hour trip charge for $103. They brought all blankets, tape, and shrink-wrap. They even had tools to dissemble my furniture and assemble it at my new place.  Andy communicated with me a few days before my move date to confirm and communicated with me throughout the day on the scheduled move date to keep me updated of any time changes. (The move was scheduled for 11AM but the crew had a bigger job so it pushed back to 12:30. I had the option for another crew at our originally scheduled time but I was running late so it worked out perfectly).   The crew was very fast, kind, and did not damage any of my items. The crew shrink  wrapped furniture and packed up my flat panels with extra care. They were willing to disassemble and assemble all of my furniture but I declined just to save some time.  The crew did disassemble assemble some items and took the time to do a perfect job.   I estimated $500 for my move -- about 4 hours + 1 hour trip time -- and they completed the job in 2.5 hours and the final bill came to $360.   Andy is very fair with the quote process. If you are up front and open with him about what you have and how ready you will be -- i.e. boxed vs. loose items -- I believe your final bill will be extremely close if not exact. There were no added fees or surprises for the final bill.   Now, the crew did say I was especially ready for the move: most of my items were in boxes and color coded for the rooms. So, I don't want everyone to think they are going to pay less than what they are quoted. However, they did move as fast as they could without rushing and cutting corners.  Just-In Time also does furniture delivery service.   I will only use Just-In Time in the future and recommended them to the property manager at my new place. These guys are awesome.

What is this place?!!!! AMAZING. My boyfriend took me here and I was blown away. I spent the first 20 minutes ogling everyone's food. The best fried chicken I have ever had and the waffles are insanely delicious. I also love how they serve drinks in mason jars.   The service is scattered as others have mentioned but everyone is really nice. Our food came out quickly enough and was perfect.   This isn't a quick place to eat, set aside about an hour on a weekend morning.   Definitely will be back and it's a shame I don't live closer otherwise I would eat here more often.

The pizza and wings here are amazingly delicious. Probably my favorite pizza in the Valley -- over Oreganos, Barros, Mellow Mushroom, and NYPD. I think it's the crust that I like the best here at Streets of New York.   However, the pasta is not good at all here. I went last night and had the spaghetti, it tasted really plain, like a 6/10. Our service was great, though. The inside of the restaurant is decorated like the outside with street lamps and stuff along with a couple of flat panel televisions.   So, no pasta for me but I will continue to order yummy pepperoni pizza and 16 honey bbq wings. Delivery drivers are fast and super friendly.

Eh this place is mediocre. I ordered a steamed Hebrew Kosher hot dog thinking it would be like Costco's and it was brown on the outside, not sure why. Tasted ok, kind of dried out. I guess the buns here are homemade but I didn't really like them. Onions rings were okay. My boyfriend ordered a chilli cheese dog and a corn dog and he said both tasted cheap. It looked cheap. The nacho cheese was like that stuff at skating rinks from when you were a kid.   It was also super hot in the restaurant. The owner had a portable AC going so maybe his AC was out or something.  Won't be back unless it's for like a pretzel or something -- those looked good.

Super trendy restaurant with pretty decent food. Service is kind of slow and the place is loud but it's in a great location and definitely a fun place to go whether it's your first or only stop of the night.   If you like other Sam Fox restaurants like Sauce you will probably like this place. The pretzels which cheese fondue are so yummy!

Kind of an odd location -- easy access coming north on Tatum but it is on the corner of what looks to be an old office building. I almost missed it entirely.  I haven't been inside but the drive-thru is great. I didn't know The Coffee Bean had drive-thrus so this is a VICTORY.

This is one the best high-rise condominiums in the Phoenix area and the best condo complex in the Scottsdale/Desert Ridge area. And trust me, I've looked at everything from Kierland in North Scottsdale to Safari in Old Town.  The amenities are great: - gorgeous pool with several new gas grills and lounge furniture - security 24/7 - completely gated and secure - private parking garage floor for residents  The units themselves are gorgeous and luxurious.  - One of my favorite features are the 10 foot ceilings with floor-to-ceiling windows in every room. The views are calming.  - There is absolutely no noise - The units are very energy efficient.   The staff -- Tina and Ann -- are also fantastic.  - They are quick to follow-up with any questions you may have  - Work orders are also completed in a very timely manner and they leave a copy of the work order so you know the issue was resolved.  The community is kind and courtesy.  - Dog friendly - Polite neighbors  City North - clean and quiet - variety of bars, shops, and restaurants - safe - right next door to Desert Ridge

After living in the Valley for over 10 years in a variety of apartments, many of them "luxury" there is NO comparison to the Residences in High Street. I've lived here for over 3 years and have loved almost every day.   In every category The Residences' excels: the staff is kind, helpful, and super responsive. The grounds and complex are immaculate -- everything is spotless and feels new. The units are beautiful, high quality, and in fantastic condition (like new).    Any issue, and there seem to be only a few minor ones every once in awhile, are addressed promptly and professionally. In so many ways I truly feel pampered as a resident living here. I feel it's the best place to live in Phoenix.  With quick and easy access to the freeways and walking distance to wonderful shops and dining The Residences is quiet and peaceful. I forget I have neighbors unless I run into someone in the hall or by the pool.   Thank you to the amazing people that make home so wonderful. It seems effortless but I imagine it is a lot of work to be so truly excellent in property management.

I just read the reviews for this place and I didn't really experience any of the issues.   1. I filled out the WAHOO online form. Within 2 minutes an agent called, confirmed my details (name, DOB, reason for visit), and said she sent the info the the Tatum location. She advised me to wait to hear from them.   2. About 10 minutes later Tatum Urgent Care called. She said she had an opening in an hour. That was great for me. I rested in my pjs until I had to get dressed to leave and drive 2 minutes from my house to this location.   3. I get there and it's easy to find on the first floor. Lots of parking -- I even found shade!   4. Nurse up front is kind and confirms my info. Hands me a clipboard with 1 form to fill out and their privacy notice. Boom -- filled out in 2 minutes.   5. Less than 5 minutes  later a nurse calls me into "the room." She is very kind and polite. Takes my blood pressure and info. I compliment her on how nice she is.   6. Less than 10 minutes later the NP shows up. She was SUPER KIND and asked me what was wrong. I had knee pain (still do as I write this...blergy blergy pain) and she said that I needed an MRI. She asked me if that was okay -- she clearly wanted to help me if the cost was too much. I have insurance and wasn't worried about my deductible so not a worry. But it is so nice that they are aware of the cost of medical care in this country.   7. She advised a knee brace, told me how much it would be if my insurance didn't cover it (super bonus, never had a medical place tell me anything about cost up front). Made sure it fit and was helpful.   8. Checked out 5-10 minutes later.   Bottom line: quick and pain-free (not my knee, from the staff) visit. I would certainly return. I was out in like 30 minutes.

I have finally found my primary care office -- no matter where I live in Phoenix I will absolutely be a patient of Desert Ridge Family Physicians.   This medical practice is unique: appointments are scheduled 24-48 hours in advance (So if you want to see the doctor on Wednesday you call on Monday).   They ONLY schedule appointments 1-2 days out. At first I thought this was weird but it's actually genius: when you schedule an appointment you are usually experiencing a health issue at the immediate time,i.e. bad flu, nonstop migraines, whatever your ailment is. And to have to wait week(s) to get in to see your doctor kind of defeats the purpose.   Not at DRFP: you can get in same day if you have a truly concerning issue. FANTASTIC. For regular check-ups, you just schedule for a few days in advance and it's not a big deal.  They are using technology! Your doctor emails you your patient plan after each appointment as well as copies of any labs you have done for your own records. (They use a special online software). You can email your doctor with questions or concerns without having to schedule an appointment to simply ask how you change the dosing time of your meds or something). Again, this just helps keep the relationship with your doctor organized and effective.   Location: Great spot across from Desert Ridge and next door is a Sonoran Quest labs -- so any labs DRFP can't do you just walk across the street.   My only complaint is that I tend to have to wait a long time -- both before I'm brought back and for the doctor. But this is only because my appointments are never rushed -- they are not looking at the clock -- so you get what you need. If that means I have to wait an extra 20 minutes but get the full attention of my doctor then I'm all for it.   Absolutely wonderful.

Wow. This place is legendary and now I finally get it. Trust me, for a long time, as I kept seeing "The Vig" constantly pop up on my Facebook newsfeed, I instantly thought this place was just a trendy restaurant.   Shame on me for randomly judging because The Vig is by far one of my absolute favorite restaurants.   The atmosphere is relaxing but fun. It definitely has a bar type feel but the Uptown location is much larger than the original location off of Indian School. It has about three times the number of booths and a huge outdoor space. The bar area is spacious and the environment itself is just really calm and modern.   The food. Can we talk about the food?! It is I-N-S-A-N-E. Try having giant tator tots stuffed with cheese. Or a queso dip that will make you scrap the bottom of the bowl. OR...THE MAC AND CHEESE. Seriously. The Vig is not messing around: they even circle for you on the menu and have a big arrow that points to it and says "wow!" At first I thought that was kind of arrogant and gimmicky but really, this dish is iconic.   And if pasta isn't your thing today, they have loads of sandwiches, burgers, and salads (I think). Something for everyone.   Go to The Vig. Trust me. You will LOVE IT.

Ummm okay so this is the most amazing, yummy, place for burgers. If you have never eaten a burger here you will bite into your perfectly made meal, put it down, and tell your friend through garbled words that it's the best burger you've ever had.   Everything is fresh and they offer a ton of toppings. You can get regular fries or cajun flavored. I find Cajun flavored a must since you can't get it anywhere else and the regular frieds are kind of plain, although they are seasoned with salt.   Only problem is this food is really, really high in calories (duh) but it's worth it. Just don't eat and feel guilty about it. Enjoy it.  If you don't want a burger they do have hot dogs and grilled cheese. Both look good. Also, the way the soda machine words is cool and the soda tastes really delicious.   Service is great. I've walked in at 9:50 starving and apologizing for coming in so late and the staff reassured me I was fine. That says something -- although what exactly I couldn't tell you.  There menu is basic and they don't have milkshakes. Some think it's expensive and it is for a "fast food burger" -- like $6.00 before drinks or fries -- but the quality is the cause for the price difference.

After years of cycling through your typical nail salon options: packed Asian shops with tons of clients and questionable hygiene or super pricey and pretenious day spas, I have finally found my nail salon. If you want a regular place to get your nails done this is IT.   While I had always searched for a regular hair stylist (and have found mine: Shay @ Aura), I could never find a regular nail technician. Usually I'd find a place that would do my nails but it was all the same. No client relationship, bland decor, chain-like service. (Think Super Paulene's nails or Scottsdale Nails II).   Not so with Polished. This is a super comfortable, nicely decorated, warm, friendly, and charming nail salon. These ladies CARE about you as a client and about the job they do. They want you to be a regular client.  Unlike other nail salons who really couldn't care less if you return because there is someone else waiting to take your place, Polished is like a great hair salon but for your hands and feet.   I saw Sharie and she was fantastic. She was great to talk to and did a great job with my mani and pedi. My nails were a hot mess (I had bitten them all off the day before and they were looking ragged) and she worked her magic. She didn't scold me for biting my nails like other technicians I've been to. She spent an 1.5 hours to do a quick spa pedi and full Shellac set. The time was relaxing and fun, and my nails look perfect.   It was $55 for both services after a $10 first-time client discount. So $65 for a mani and gel set is really reasonable.   Their location is great and easy to get in-and-out of (right off Shea and Scottsdale Rd, on the other end of the Oregano's parking lot).  Note: This place prefers CASH or CHECK. There isn't an ATM nearby either.

Rideflex is now Roadrunner Limo. I'm not sure which came first or if Roadrunner acquired Rideflex.  I use this car service because it's substantially cheaper than other car service companies: $71 to PHX Sky Harbor versus like $90+ from other companies I received quotes from. I have an account with Roadrunner and use them on a regular basis when I travel.   They are never late which is awesome and always super polite. The cars are hit or miss: some are gorgeous and new and black and shiny and others kind of seem like taxi-cabs -- the lack of beautiful cars bothers me about Roadrunner. However, I do realize the price difference.   Some of the drivers can be annoying and super chatty. I'm not really confrontational so I never ask them to be quiet. There are little luxurious missing like bottles of water.  Sometimes I've requested a towncar and the driver has showed up in a SUV. The driver told me it was a "complimentary upgrade" but the SUVs aren't nearly as comfortable as the towncars.    I will continue to use them based on price but I'd might consider upgrading to a new company when I feel okay spending more money.

This place is not a Mexican Grill--it's a bar that also serves food. It's shines as a nightspot and comes to life on Friday and Saturday. Save your time and money for a little -- or a lot -- of drinking.   Don't go on Thursday nights unless you like terrible "throwback" music. It's like random old school hip-hop/rap songs and the DJ always cuts the tracks and odd times.  The drinks here are pricey but they are generous with alcohol. They throw you a bone with $2 street tacos which are insanely delicious.   Outdoor patio is a smoker's delight and is as big as the main restaurant. Two full bars with flat screens surround the bar.   Weekend are fun: it's packed by 10:00PM and people dance in this section of the dining room they push tables out of the way. Yeah...not a club but hey, it works. I've done the Cupid Shuffle many, many times.  During the weekday it's busy but not crowded. Music always comes on around 10:00PM.  And curiously enough there is always a sketchy cab monopoly. It used to be VIP Taxi and now I don't know what it is but it doesn't look good.   Super casual and fun. But it is kind of out of the way and there is no food around that's open besides In & Out.   I think the cover is $10 for guys. Ladies are in free.

This is a painful review for me to write because I truly love the idea of iPic. And the theater itself is gloriously wonderful. So is the food. But the hangup for me here is the absolute terrible service. And on a premium theater experience that encourages you to "sit back and relax" while you pay $25 a seat to have a waiter bring you drinks and food, they have some of the worst wait staff.   1.) It takes forever for your waiter to greet you and ask you want you want to drink. At first I thought this was atypical, but I've seen three movies in the past two months and each time I worried if anyone was even going to come by.   2.) They took our order but each of the three times forgot something. They didn't charge us, but  for example, I asked for Reese's Pieces to be brought out after dinner. (Which they say they will time for you). Never saw them. Server also never came back to even check on us.   3.) Hard to get popcorn and drink refills. It feels like after they deliver your food they disappear. Twice I needed a drink refill and could not get one. The other time he came super late and then took forever to bring it back. Ugh.   So all in all I would recommend iPic for the seats but don't expect good service. I'll go back because the seats are so comfy and it still beats Harkins. Just really dissapointed that for the price and the image they market themselves as, they are really falling short.

Well whatever issues with the service/wait staff going on toward the end of last year, I can positively say they are fully resolved.   Since my last review I have been to iPic in Scottsdale on 2 separate occasions and BOTH of them were absolutely stellar. I mean perfection. So wonderful that I was skeptical it was a fluke, hence why it took me a few more times to really, fully, believe iPic is once again a true movie experience.   Attentive wait staff? Check Unlimited popcorn (2-3 refills and fast) Check More wine? More iced-tea? Check, check Awesomely timed dinner and dessert? Check DELICIOUS food? Check  I always get the VIP upgrade b/c I love the seating (becomes a giant bed with a super soft blanket).   Really, THANK YOU iPIC for your constant attention to service and willingness to improve.

I'm not a major fan of their coffee right now -- I'm going through my obsession with The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf at the moment --- BUT they are a delicious alternative to multi-national chains and you can show your support for local, eco-friendly businesses. This is a true coffee shop.   The shop itself is kind of small and narrow but you can't go wrong with Scottsdale Quarter.  Their hot chocolate is yummy.   Oh, their logo is awesome.

I was here last week and it was completely empty. Like so empty it seemed as if they were closed or something. I was the only customer from 1:30PM to 3:15PM.  They continually offered me tea or something else so that was nice.   The guy was really personable and did a great job on my nails. The salon is very, very well decorated and comfortable--one of the best looking salons I've been to short of the resort day spas.  The only downside was it was a little pricy and he talked in another language most of the time to his boss. To be expected, but it still annoys me because I think it's rude. I think it was around $60+tip for a french manicure and regular pedicure.   So...  PROS - great location and easy parking at Scottsdale Quarters - nice salon: posh pedicure chairs  CONS - pricey - dead  I may or may not be back. It's so nice that it's not really overpriced, but it's still a lot to spend. It definitely feels like a middle ground between the regular chain shops and Rolfs or a resort spa.   The location is nice because it's a good place to get your nails done before or after lunch given the food places right in the Quarters and across the street.   The guy said the salon is really struggling because of the location: very few people walk by that side of the Quarters (it's on the far north end kind of by Brio).  I'm really bummed because I did a previous review about Polished Nail Spa on Shea but I don't go there anymore because 1.) they don't take credit cards and there isn't an ATM nearby and 2.) I hate their pedicure chairs.   So I'll keep Avalon in my rotation of nail salons.

I was a regular client of Shay at Aura Salon until she changed careers a few months ago. I found Ling Yang at Jo Paris and I am absolutely thrilled.   It's really, really hard (first world problems, I know) when you lose a stylist. I saw Shay at Aura and felt like she cut and colored my hair perfectly. I didn't think it was likely I could find another stylist that would match her expertise and the fun time we had together while she did my hair. As I've been to numerous Valley salons (Dolce, Rolfs, Fate Image, Mane Attraction) I didn't really know where to turn. Jo Paris saved me.  The salon itself is beautiful, relaxing, and spacious. Easy to find and lots of parking. The stations are modern and comfortable with great lighting and lots of room for your purse, drink, cell phone etc. They have several shampoo stations and a young, cool vibe.   Ling Yang is fantastic. She is full of personality -- in a good, not annoying way -- and instantly made me feel comfortable. She listened what I wanted and respected my anxiety and concerns over changing stylists. The color came out perfect and I love my hair cut. She added  her own slight style change to the cut after we talked about it and it's a great, minor change. She also didn't push me to buy any products which I love. (I absolutely hate feeling like I have to sit through a sales presentation after spending $$$ on getting my hair done).  I feel totally confident and am relieved to have found her.   My only "gripe" is that Jo Paris does not carry Kerastase products and as such does not provide Kerastase conditioning treatments, which I love. However, this was the first time I skipped one in 2 years and I honestly didn't notice a difference. So take that for what it's worth.  Also, I didn't have any problems paying with AMEX like others have mentioned because Ling does her own booking and accepts payment direct from the client.   Go see Ling!!

Salt is the alternative in my book to a place like Sandbar and the clubs in Old Town. Loud music and dim lighting like Old Town but not super crowded like Sandbar. Hence, a lounge...  You will pay the same--drinks are like $12 and up but they are really good and usually pretty strong.   The dj's on the weekends are pretty good. I was there last Saturday and he kept playing like 80s remixes, but out of the three times I've been to Salt this was the first time I wasn't totally happy with the music. The crowd was also a little bit older so maybe that's who he was catering to that night.  They have tables and couches that are open to first-come-first-service (way different than Old Town where you have to reserve a table) and a really nice bar area if you prefer or can't find a table.  You can dress up or dress casual. I've seen both and each option fits in just fine.   Parking is nice because it's free in the garage just 5 minutes from Salt or you can valet right outside the lounge.   Atmosphere is pretty cool. It is attached to the iPic but they do a great job of separating the two. The only time you know you're next to a movie theater is when you head to the bathroom which is in between the iPic and Salt.  The place has been pretty busy to packed each time I've gone but I've never had trouble finding a seat.   However, this is NOT a place to dance. They have a dance floor but no one uses it. If you want super loud music where it's hard to hear and you want to dance or party, head to Old Town. If you just want to chill in a cool place, head to Salt.

I found this place through Yelp! yesterday and ordered some delivery while I was working at-home. This place wasn't amazing but it's pretty good for American Chinese food and I will def. be ordering again.   The menu is really varied which is awesome and they include all of your standard, traditional favorites.   The delivery was fast (about 20 minutes).   The only downside was the lady who answered the phone could barely speak English and had a really hard time understanding me on my phone number, address, and credit card info. But...it was totally worth it.   I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, spring rolls, and steamed rice. All yummy. They even put the sweet and sour sauce in a seperate container which I love because it gives you control over how much sauce you want (hey, sometimes I just want the chicken without the sauce) and is great for leftovers.   There is no other good Chinese food delivery in the area.   A great find. Try it! You probably won't be disappointed or greatly impressed.

I stepped into Floo-id Yoga after scouring the Internet for a spa-like yoga studio that didn't judge my lack of fitness ability. I'm on the way to a healthy lifestyle and wanted a place I could feel comfortable and encouraged despite my absolute lack of yoga experience and I found it at Floo-id Yoga.  The studio itself: Floo-id Yoga feels like a spa when you walk in -- beautifully decorated with a calm and relaxing  vibe. The bathrooms are equally spa-like with great showers, giant sinks with awesome mint-lavender soap. There are two studios (1 small one and 1 large main one that holds 30-40 comfortably) with bamboo floors. There are cubbies for your stuff, lots of benches, and a fridge stocked with Smart Water and coconut water.  The atmosphere and class structure: Flood-id Yoga is a place for absolute beginners to those who have several years of practice. They offer a wide variety of classes throughout the day (from hot flow, to hot yoga, to yin yoga, and more) to accomodate most schedules and skill sets and fitness levels.  There are about 5-7 teachers and I've taken classes with Beth, Jen, Donna, and Angela. There are all great.   What I love most about Floo-id is there lack of pressure. They truly want you to simply practice and listen to your body -- go where you want to go. During class they always explain how to modify poses for more advanced yogis or what to work on if you are just starting out. As for hot yoga, there is no pressure to "perform" in the class. You can lay down, sit down, and just do what you can do to get through the hot 60 minutes. Some classes I do amazing and get through the entire 60 minutes no problem and other times, like yesterday, I literally laid on my mat for 30 minutes.   All of the teachers are so kind, encouraging, and helpful. Beth is the owner and she teaches classes often is constantly at the studio to greet you and make you feel welcome. Jen is super sweet and calming and Donna puts you at ease with her blend of humor and encouragement.   Logistics: You can sign up to have an account online where you can view and register for classes as well as see your entire account history. Love the technology.  Parking is easy (a few shops down from Whole Foods on Scottsdale Rd and Mayo near the 101). My advice is just to get to class about 20 minutes early to ensure you get the spot you want. Some classes are fill up more than others.  Pricing: I signed up for the unlimited monthly membership for $99/month when it was on sale during their 2-year anniversary sale. I think it's normally $139. It's totally worth it. I try to go everyday and usually end up going 5-6 times a week. However, they have a range of options to fit your budget and commitment level.   They also have a great selection of yoga mats and towels along with cute clothes for sale.   LOVE FLOO-ID YOGA!!!

This is one of my absolute favorite bars in Old Town. It is casual with really good food but plays loud top 40 music with great drinks. What more could you ask for?  Service is great and the bathrooms are clean. The restaurant has outdoor seating which is great for people watching and right in the heart of Old Town nightlife.  You're within walking distance to The Mint, Dollhouse, Smashboxx, and the Pussycat Lounge.   If I didn't live a $40 cab ride away (one-way) I'd come here way more often.   Lots of huge flat panel tvs and plenty of seating. It gets packed on weekends but the place is pretty big so it never feels overwhelmingly crowded.   This is not a good place to dance. There is actually no dance floor. But maybe that won't stop you or I after a few drinks...

Ah, I love Drybar!!! First off, they are all super friendly and accommodating. I walked in 30 minutes early and was just expecting to wait--nope--they fit me right in. Not snobby at all.   I made my appointment for 8:00pm via their super intuitive and easy-to-use mobile site as I was perusing Ulta before heading out for the weekend.   My stylist (Jessica) was great. She was friendly but not too talkative to the point where it's annoying or awkward. All the clients' hair in neighboring chairs looked fabulous too.    I was offered drinks a few times and really wanted to try their white blossom cranberry cosmo but was driving home so didn't want to take any chances; I'm kind of paranoid about that stuff.   The atmosphere is so girly and happy: lots of butter yellows and white. The shampoo was so relaxing and I didn't even upgrade to the massage. They had a few flat panel televisions with Christmas movies playing (on mute but with captions) which was great and lots of magazines and great music.   I will definitely be back. I'm already on the wait list for New Year's. This is THE place to go when you need your hair quickly done. Unlike salons, which often close really early on the weekends, Drybar is open until 9:00pm Friday and Saturday! So convenient!!!   And all of this for $35.00?!! Saved me two hours of work with mediocre results. Thanks Drybar :)

Amazing! Just had my second blowout and it is fabulous! I was about 10 minutes late and felt SO bad because 1.) it's rude and 2.) when I'm late it messes up all the other appointments for the stylist(s). The staff were so kind and did not make a big deal about it at all (and it was New Year's Eve which has been booked since Thanksgiving). That is true customer service.   Also, even though I was late the stylist did not rush my hair. She certainly worked fast but I didn't feel like my style was going to be subpar or less than perfect. And it wasn't---it looks great. True customer service and exceptional work.   I may have tried Drybar once before but now I'm a longterm client. I plan to use Drybar anytime I need to feel a little extra pretty and special.

I stopped by Drybar again last Friday afternoon as a walk-in and they fit me right in! I couldn't believe it. I had tried calling to make an appointment but like others have said it goes to a call center and I waited 5+ minutes before hanging up twice. (I was browsing at Sephora next door and couldn't really sit on hold in the middle of the store).   This place is truly amazing. They have the right price point ($35+tip), do awesome work, and truly pamper you. It's hard to process just the value you get for the money. I had my friend from Manhattan with me and she was totally impressed. Kristen did my hair and it looked fabulous for my night out at Sandbar.  I actually stopped keeping track of who has done my hair since it always looks fantastic -- and I ask for a mix between the Cosmo and the Mai-Tai.  And it feels like I'm at a spa. It's actually the one place I can truly zone out and relax. I just sit there watching whatever fun movie they have playing (it's usually a chick-flick) while the stylist makes my hair look like a Victoria's Secret model.   If you happen to get your hair blown out a lot you really should buy a "bartab" --- it's much cheaper. Like $70/month for 2 blow outs or $125/month for 4 blow outs. I already spend a lot on my beauty routine so I can't afford to do this but I would in a heartbeat if I was willing to give up my Christian Dior mascara :)   This place is fun, relaxing, and worth WAY more than they charge. So thanks Drybar for making your services truly affordable.   I've been here 4 or 5 times and it's a must in my routine when I want to feel extra sexy and glamorous. So grateful a place like this exists.   Now, there are imitators like Primp and Blow (not kidding on the name) -- and I won't go there just because it feels like they ripped off the idea from Drybar and that bothers me.   Go to Drybar, you will love every minute of your experience.

I've only been here for happy hour which is an absolute blast. Great drink prices, service, and relaxing atmosphere. It's usually pretty quiet. The outdoor patio is comfy and classy. I love watching the sunset while sipping on a kettle/soda here after work.   I have not been here as a nightspot but my friends tell me great things. The entrance is pretty cool and is definitely different than all the other bars in the area -- it's a bit more upscale. I think the enforce their dress code here pretty consistently. Happy hour is casual attire.  They also do brunch here on Sundays which looks yummy and affordable.   The bathrooms are co-ed which I forgot about until I turned around from the sink and saw a guy at the other end. (The bathroom is set up so girls are on one side and guys on the other but hey, who doesn't mingle in the bathroom....)

This place is fantastic. Great for all sushi and non-sushi lovers.    Service was great, atmosphere is relaxing and modern, and the food is delicious. My group and I ordered the spring rolls, gyozas, shrimp tempura rolls, chicken teriyaki, and lobster tempura. All absolutely mouth-watering. The lobster tempura actually feels like it's melting in your mouth it's so good.   Our server was so nice and very attentive.   This place is now on my regular circulation of restaurants. I can't wait to come back for happy hour.

Awesome place. Was just here last night and the DJ and staff were great. The bathrooms are clean and nice (unlike Smashboxx--gross) and the entire atmosphere is a little more upscale . People still dance, and it does feel more like a club than a lounge, but it's a great mix. Drinks were good, service was fast.   It was pretty quiet at 10:30PM but became busier as the night went on. My friends and I shuffled back and forth between Dollhouse and Smashboxx--I definitely prefer Dollhouse. Smashboxx is great when you are looking to get dirty and sweaty dancing, Dollhouse is better if you're looking to not be a hot mess at the end of the night.

I spent New Year's Eve here with friends at a table. Bottle service was amazing (thanks Emi!) I'm sure all the servers are great but request Emi if you can, she is so sweet and makes great drinks (doesn't skimp on the Ketel and is fast if you need anything else).  The bathrooms are clean and the line isn't usually very long -- if there is one. There was only a slight line for New Year's Eve so that should tell you something.   Go to Dollhouse, have some Red Bull / Ketel and enjoy the beautiful club with awesome music.

Ahh I LOVE Ted Baker.  Great clothes and accessories, fun and courteous staff, all and all a great shopping experience.   I need to lose weight to fit into more of their clothes but at least I can still buy their accessories. My boyfriend also loves this store, great suits and shirts. This is definitely a trendy place to shop but they have a ton of classic items that are fine for multiple seasons.   They are right next door to Barney's and use their tailoring service.   Keep in mind Nordstrom has a deal with Ted Baker so some items are less expensive at Nordstrom than this store -- but it's not much, like $10-$20.

OMG Laura at the Bronze Bar is fantastic. All the 5 star reviews -- yes all 55+ of them -- are absolutely deserved. Stop looking and GO TO THE BRONZE BAR.  Here's why:  It turns out I am spray tan challenged. I tanned in beds in high school for a few years and had that down to a perfect science (high pressure, bronzers, tingles, when to shave, moisturize etc.) I had a wonderful and perfect tan.   But years have passed and now I'm paler, a bit redder on my face and arms, much heavier and now afraid of skin cancer. Hence I googled and yelped my way for a airbrush tan salon in Scottsdale.    I was drawn instantly to The Bronze Bar for its super creative and adorable name and then I did a double-take: 5 star overall rating with 59 reviews?!!   I'm a Yelper and have yet to see another business even even somewhat close to this kind of rating. Well ladies and gents, those 5 stars ring true.   Here's a quick rundown but you can read my full review below:  QUICK REVIEW  - adorable business: clean, well-decorated, feminine and comfortable  - stocks Fantasy Tan spray tan products (lotion/shower gel) but no sales. Just on the shelf if you want to buy  - Laura is kind, friendly, easy to talk to  - She makes you feel comfortable regardless of weight/shape  - She personally trains all of her employees  - Scheduling is easy and availability is usually open a few days in advance  - TALENTED in proper color and technique: even, gorgeous bronze tan  - Takes AMEX  - Extremely affordable  - Not pretentious  - Very knowledgeable on how to modify spray tan (pre and post care) for skin type  - EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE: Laura does everything possible to make sure you LOVE your tan. Available pre and post tan to answer questions, ease fears/concerns. - Great work ethic - Offers mobile airbrushing - Great location, close to 101: easy to get to and leave  FULL REVIEW  I diligently scoured through each Yelp review because I tend to research everything to death (I literally suck the fun out of something out of fear I'll be unprepared...) There were a few 4 star reviews but when I read them they didn't make sense (knocking down a star because you wanted a booth and it's an airbrush? seriously?). Stuff like that.   I made an appointment easily and quickly online via The Bronze Bar's website. Fantastic scheduling and instant email confirmation along with a reminder email.   I went in for my first ever airbrush tan thinking I was totally prepared. I had read all the dos and donts for hours from the internet,  bought an expensive exfoliant to ensure success because I'm just high-maintenance like that -- and took the plunge.   Laura was totally sweet and didn't care that I was a few (okay maybe a lot) of pounds overweight. I felt totally comfortable in my g-string and flabby, pale stomach.   We discussed color and Laura explained it goes from 1-8 (or 1-7, I think). Since this was a trial run before an event, I went with a 1. The spray tan took about 15 minutes and Laura was friendly and easy to talk to. She's clear with instructions.   I've since had three spray tans with Laura in 3 weeks and it looks phenomenal. Even. Perfect color. No smell. The first two I kept messing up (shaving too soon before the session, shaving too soon after, etc.) and Laura worked with me -- but never acted irritated or annoyed -- even when I'd continually mess up her gorgeous work.   ****I even spilled WATER all over myself the day of my airbrush tan -- about 3 hours after -- and Laura made time to correct my wonky tan that day despite her 12-hour booked solid day. She didn't even charge me or make me feel like I was a pain (even though like I said, I'm spray tanned challenged). That was yesterday and my tan came out absolutely perfect. She works miracles.****  The shop seems like it's located in an odd location but it's actually SUPER easy to park and leave. (If you are heading west on Indian School just turn left onto 78th St then your first right onto 1st Ave and then another right on to Kalarama Ave (you do a loop and it's much easier).   The Bronze Bar adorable and well-decorated -- very feminine -- and super clean. There is product for you to buy (lotions and shower gels) but Laura doesn't even mention them. No pushy sales.   Will never go another salon (and I live in N. Scottsdale and drive 25 minutes each way).   LOVE THE BRONZE BAR.

How have I never stepped foot in a Sephora before?!! Ah what I was missing -- thinking Ulta was a beauty supply store Ha! Sephora is like the Nordstrom of makeup and beauty stores and Ulta is like the Target.   Sephora is an experience -- from the high-end makeup to the gorgeous store and cute bags. I am so happy that I don't have to drive to Nordstrom at Fashion Square to find most of my make-up now -- except for MAC, and I am faithful to my Studio Fix. Sephora carries tons of brands: Urban Decay, Stila, Too Faced, Christian Dior, Chanel along with high-end hair care products like Carol's Daughter and Bumble and Bumble (but no Kerastase...bummer).  The store is small though and felt packed on a Friday afternoon. But don't worry because there is tons of parking right across the street in the Scottsdale Quarter south side parking garage. (Even if you have to park in the basement there are elevators to take you right up to the ground level).  I'm still partial to Ulta for things like makeup remover wipes and fake eyelashes since they carry the brand I love, but I will definitely be browsing Sephora more often which is unfortunate for my bank account.

Okay there are some hardcore Mellow Mushroom lovers out there and I get why: this place has the most creative and delicious pizza combinations.  One of my favorites is the Yukon Gold Potato which is like a baked potato with bacon, chives, cheese, and sour cream in pizza format. It sounds weird and possibly gross but it's really yummy -- the pizza is pretty light and the flavors are subtle.  I've also had the olive oil with mozzarella cheese and that is sooo good -- especially with their crust. Seriously, this crust is like crack. You can't get it anywhere else. Some people comment their crust is slightly sweet and it does have molases in it but I don't taste anything sweet, it's just really soft. They dust their crust with some kind of cheese -- also amazing.  There are tons of combinations to try and Mellow really has a lot of "normal" pizza options with a plenty of "gettin' crazy" ones. I'm never disappointed when I come here.  And if you refuse to enjoy their pizza, they have lots of salads and sandwiches to aid in your rebellion.   The bar staff and servers are nice and always in a good mood. The decorations are cool and all in all it's a fun place to go. I've been here 4-5 times and it never disappoints. Also, if you're not sure, there is a Groupon going on for the next few days: $10 for $20.

I took my 5-year-old Maltese to my longtime groomer, Jessica E. at Cage Free Grooming at her recommendation. Jessica E. has groomed my Toby for years and I have followed her as her grooming career has blossomed. (She is an AMAZING groomer, ask for her if you can).   Cage Free is really conveniently located in Tempe. Lots of parking and close to lots of other shops. Totally easy to drop your dog off and get some of your errands out of the way.   The salon is: - clean - welcoming - quiet - professional  - affordable  - cage free  I instantly felt comfortable as I entered the salon with Toby. The salon is spotless which is really hard to accomplish. I was even looking for hair and for imperfections (just because I'm nervous to leave my dog at new places). Jessica had me fill out some paperwork and took an extra few minutes to let my dog run around and make sure he was comfortable. Those little extra touches mean a lot to me.   Jessica has groomed Toby for years but she still always takes the time to ask what I'd like and discuss what he needs. She always gets it perfect. Toby loves her and I should note, Jessica really understands each breed: their unique temperaments, what their grooming needs are, etc.   I also love how at Cage Free my dog is free to roam under close supervision. I always hate going to other salons that just keep him in the tiniest cage possible for hours.   Overall I would absolutely return. I don't really understand these negative reviews. For one, you have to sign a permission for them to shave your animal. If you signed the form then you gave them permission. Also, grooming instructions can be really subjective. I always bring in a picture of my dog with a grooming cut I like.   I will note that I don't think I interacted with the owner but I didn't notice any problems with any other animals or think their grooming cuts looked bad.

I made an appointment with Vanity Blowout Bar on Friday afternoon for an appointment the following Saturday. The Yelp reviews were very positive and consistent -- unlike many other blowout bars in areas -- and so I was hopeful Vanity could be a great alternative to Drybar at the Scottsdale Quarters.   Drybar won my heart 2 years ago and since then I've seen countless blowout salons pop up around the Valley. None of those salons grabbed my attention -- some even seemed downright tacky -- and so I was super stressed when Drybar was (of course) booked solid on Saturday. I really needed someone to do a quick undo for a wedding that evening and my main stylist (Ling at Jo Paris) was out of town. Ugh. Shame on me for scheduling last minute, right? Hey, I thought I could learn to French braid off YouTube -- obviously not.   Vanity Blowout Bar is about to give Drybar a run for the money! This place has everything Drybar lacks and I can't wait to go back. If you've given up on finding a good blowout bar in Scottsdale -- look no further! Vanity will save you.   Vanity is truly a 45 minute escape (or longer because they offer a range of services). The owner, Stacy, greeting me warmly as I walked in a few minutes before my 1PM appointment for an updo.   Here's the rundown: - warm and inviting: salon features pale rose paint, beautiful tile, and a serene atmosphere. It's very, very spa-like.  - Stacy actually works at the salon! I love when the owner is there to greet and help clients. It makes me feel reassured.  - I was offered a range of beverages: coffee, tea, soda, etc. They also had yummy cookies out front (not that I should be eating cookies but hey...) - It was so, so quiet. And peaceful  - Booking was easy (confirmation email, reminder email, and optional text reminder) - They offer makeup and nail services - No charge for use of hot styling tools - No upsell on products or services - All stylists are licensed (not always the case at establishments that charge extra for curling and flat irons...) - EASY parking  - Affordable - FANTASTIC styling  My stylist Nicole did an absolute perfect (and I mean perfect) job on my hair. She was friendly, skilled, quick, and kind. I showed her a few pictures and it took her 25 minutes to replicate the look (a side swept French braid pulled into a messy bun). I was glowing when I walked out the door.   The owner Stacy was also super honest. I booked a full updo for $65 because I didn't want to assume the look I wanted was "easy." I don't know what it takes to do these things. When I was finished, Stacy said she would only charge me for the casual undo at $35. I didn't even have to ask or mention it!!! That is true customer service.  Will certainly return. In fact, I cannot WAIT to find an excuse to go back. Thank you Stacy and Nicole!!

OMG what is this place? And why-oh-why did I discover just as summer in Phoenix is gearing up?  This place is soooo good with amazing customer service. Everything on the menu looks delicious even their salads, but um, so far I haven't "had a chance" to try one -- to preoccupied with these delicious hot dogs and ITALIAN BEEF sandwiches.   Food is super fresh and taste really high quality (for fast food). This is actually the only fast food I will eat. So YUMMMY.   Seriously. This place even has a drive-thru.   Most delicious casual lunch/dinner place in the entire North Scottsdale area. A true favorite.

Broadstone Waterfront is one thing: smoke and mirrors. The gorgeous lobby and amenity deck will delight you and the place looks fine when you tour but this place is far from true luxury. As a former tenant of the Residences on High Street (and moving back there at the end of my lease here), Broadstone Waterfront is NOT worth the money unless you are a 20-something with money to burn don't care about noise level, cleanliness/quality, or customer service.  The best part is the location. It could not be better for living in Old Town. Really fantastic. Outside of Scottsdale Waterfront, which you can't rent for under $5k/month, this is the best spot to be in Old Town.  But for that location you will pay in the form of:  1. Inconsiderate Tenants Many of the tenants here can't seem to understand how to be a good neighbor. There are notices every month that tell residents to please pick up after their pets -- both outside and INSIDE the complex. That's right, some people let their dogs pee/poo in the hallways here.  Some tenants also don't understand the concept of a trash chute. You put your trash down the chute. Nope, they just leave bags of trash rotting in the trash room or their giant boxes in the hallway.  This of course isn't everyone but it's enough people to really bring the community down.  2. Noise/Paper Thin Walls You can hear EVERYTHING. Cell phone ringing? Someone's alarm? Yep. I've grown used to hearing my neighbor's alarm go off as I get ready for work in my bathroom because the sound travels through the vents. A family with a baby just moved in we hear the baby crying frequently. (Obviously not the parents fault but still, you can hear everything).  3. Poor Service/Lost Paperwork Broadstone Waterfront has lost pretty much every piece of paperwork we've even turned in. Income Verification? Said they didn't have it 6 months after we moved in. Renter's insurance? Got a note we were not in compliance even though it was uploaded to their resident portal AND REQUIRED for us to get the keys to our new place. Our move-out notice? Lost, glad I followed-up because we had to submit a new one.   Following up on maintenance issues? Be prepared to call 2-3x a day to get a response to, "I'll find out and call you right back."   Sometimes they tell you they can't find your package, then you show them who signed for it, and it magically appears.   The new manager is fantastic (thank you Trisha!) but she can't do everything. And prior to her, this place was absolutely terrible with organization.   Office hours also are not great for people who work and the weekends they only have one person working so you will have to wait.  4. Cheap Upgrades / No Storage / Lack of Regular Maintenance / Not Energy Efficient Outside of the nice kitchen and washer/dryer, the rest of the apartment is cheap. Cheap floors. Cheap cabinets. Cheap shower. Not really what I'd call luxury. Stuff breaks ALL the time and they don't automatically replace the A/C filter for you. You have to call every month.  These apartments have NO storage. I pay $1700 out the door for a 1 bedroom have just have a tiny "walk-in" closet. That's it. All other storage needs (coat closet, bathroom linen closet) has to go in the walk-in, which is already crammed full with me and spouse's, you know, actual clothes. The floor plan we picked showed a coat closet. It wasn't there upon move-in.   I debated upgrading to a 2 bedroom just for the space but just the base rent is outrageous. (Each pet is $50, plus $50 for storage, + $70 for common area utilities, + whatever I pay for my own utilities).   I've paid between $50 and $150 for my SRP bill. For about 650 square feet, keeping the AC to 75 during the day and 72 at night. Insane.  5. Common Areas Could Be Improved No water or soda in the common area fridge -- despite us paying $70+/month for common area utilities (?!) Gas grills sometimes work. Cabana TVs sometimes work, often broken. Just stuff you wouldn't expect for the marketing and the rent of this community.   The common areas also get pretty dirty. Parking garage is filthy -- never cleaned and there is still dirt and grime leftover from construction. Dumpster area constantly smells.   6. WiFi Issues Because of how close everyone is to each other here and the cheapness of the walls, everyone's signal gets mixed so the internet can be really spotty. I know it's the WiFi bc when I plug directly into the internet it works flawlessly.   Construction: I also survived the construction of this place. We were promised our apartment would be ready upon move-in. Literally, the crews were still working on our apartment when we got our keys and it was the first one done in the entire section. Broadstone gave us NO indication they were that far behind on construction and we had to suffer through about 4 months of construction noise and crews 7am to 5pm (along with living in a construction site full of dirt, tools, and unsafe places fully exposed).
