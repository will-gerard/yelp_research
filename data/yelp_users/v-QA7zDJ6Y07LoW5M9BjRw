Step back in time! Every once in awhile you start to look for something different for lunch and then pops up a place like MacAlpines. Besides the great 50's atmosphere and good food, this place will have you smiling and reminicing the moment you step into the door!  I am not downtown that often but rest assured, I will be back to this place.

The House of Tricks is aptly named. They have a box full of "tricks" to get you in the door along with many to make sure that you don't return.   Don't be fooled! This clever house of tricks keeps their way over priced, mediocre food and horrible service well hidden until you, and your wallet, have already be taken. Quite the slight of hand!!  I made the mistake of taking my family there for my wife's birthday (6 of us altogether). After sitting for 15 minutes we were greeted by Ben who immediately let us know through his inaction and disinterest that this was going to be a long night of "no service". Ben didn't need to be concerned, though-he was getting his tip no matter what he did, or didn't do for this table. Our choice should have been Burger King for the service, if nothing else. Sorry, no disrespect to those who wear the crown ;-). The bottom line-the House of Tricks has THE WORST SERVICE in Arizona!!!   Their overpriced food features barely palatable dishes and the portions are small. If you eat there don't expect any "wow" from the food. The only "wow" you will get is when you see the bill!!  In this economy Arizona has seen the doors of many restaurants shut. We don't need a magic door at the House of Tricks, but we do need it to close!!!

This is a great place for vacuum repair! I dropped mine off on Tuesday, went back and picked it up on Wednesday repaired and cleaned! Great service and reasonable prices!

If you are looking for a camera or accessories do yourself a favor and drive past Ritz Camera! After spending nearly $1400 on a Nikon camera and having it 13 months, the staff at Ritz told me that because I didn't buy their "extended" warranty that would not help me regarding a defect with the camera despite the fact that Nikon has a 1 year manufacturers warranty. Their "solution" was for me to bring it in so they could send it to CRIS camera repair ($45 charge) and they would determine if it was a defect or damage caused by me. They wouldn't contact Nikon-I had to make the call!  For $25 I took it to Tempe Camera and now it is heading to Nikon for repair. Maybe when Ritz goes bankrupt again they'll realize that "customer service" still counts!

I had the opportunity to use Miranda Moving who were referred by one of my fellow realtors. The move could not have gone better! They were on time, very reasonably priced and their crew were very professional.   If you are looking for great movers try Miranda-you won't regret it!! Highly recommended!

Teakwood's offers one of the few edible places in Maricopa. Fairly priced and good sized portions make it a good bet. I have been going there since they opened and most visits have been good ones. There service on most nights leaves a lot to be desired, but the food makes up for it.   If you are looking for atmosphere Teakwood's is hard to define. It is trying to be a sports bar on one side and trying to cater to families in the other. I am not quite sure what "theme" they are trying to portray but whatever it is it misses the mark. It is a good thing that the food is decent.

It's good to see that after a major remodel that Sunrise Cafe is still the best choice for food in Maricopa. They have expanded to roughly twice their original size and have added booths, a bar (beer, wine) and GREATLY enhanced the decor. Because of the lack of edible food in Maricopa, you still may have to wait to get in, but trust me-it's worth the wait!   My wife and I had dinner there for the first time and it was very good. We will definitely  return.

Great place, food and service!! The new renovation really came out well. I have not be disappointed after numerous visits!  One request: PLEASE TAKE DOWN THE POLITICAL SIGNS!! I am surprised that a good business like this one would put this stuff up. BUSINESS AND POLITICS DON'T MIX!!

The restaurant situation in Maricopa is improving! One of the bright spots is King Fish Sea and Soul Food. Terrific, authentic southern cooking!   I had the catfish with seasoned fries. The catfish is fried with a light batter that really brings out the great taste of the fish and the fries were done just right.   This is one place that I predict will do very well. They have done their homework and it shows! Thanks to the owners for bringing their talents to Maricopa-God knows we needed it!  Looking forward to my next visit.

After a couple of friend's recommendations my wife and I had the pleasure of visiting Secreto for the first time. Secreto certainly lives up to it's name and has to be one of Ahwatukee's best kept "secrets". The atmosphere, service and most importantly, the food, were outstanding.   My wife had a combination tamale dish while I had a pork dish, one of the best I have ever had. The portions and prices were very reasonable for what you could expect of a restaurant of this caliber. We especially enjoyed the atmosphere with the private booths with cushioned seating and pillows- a nice touch!  We certainly are looking forward to our next return visit to Secreto!

Todd & his staff are outstanding! His estimate was right on the money and the car was repaired sooner than he had told me. Very honest people! I will definitely use them again! Thanks to Chris @Scottsdale Muffler for once again providing me with another great vendor!
