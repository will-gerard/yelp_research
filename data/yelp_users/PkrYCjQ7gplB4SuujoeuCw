Time to re-key my house.  I called Arizona Keys Locksmith and was given a time that same day.  Levi was on time and he did an excellent job very quickly.  I would highly recommend him to anyone and would call him again.  As a matter of fact I think I will put his number in my cell phone just in case of emergency.

The spa would not run after filling.  I called to let them know.  They told me I should call the manufacturer tech support as they would not be able to get the repairman back until the following week.  I spent a half hour on the phone with tech support and ended up getting the spa running.  The repairman failed to flip a switch on the circuit board.  I am still struggling to get the front panel back on the spa and am very frustrated.  When I called to report that I had to complete the repair there was no concern that the repair was sub standard in the first place.  I was reminded that they warranty all their work!! I would never do business with this company again.

I chose an 80 min massage.  Slovica was my therapist.  She was fantastic! She released a huge trigger point on my quads that made my knee pain go away.  She also released several trigger points in my upper back.  Her massage was very thorough and included work on the subscap and teres muscles which I desperately needed. She worked deep when she needed to and checked in often.  Finished up with some comforting Swedish style strokes that left me feeling great!

I just had the best massage with Gabrielle. My elbow had been hurting and I have also noticed that while combing my hair I have a very limited range of motion in my arm. I had been having neck problems too. Not any more! I feel so good. I move like a new person. Thank you Gabrielle.

I had my first waxing ever with Cristy.  She did an amazing job. My legs are ready for vacation. She noticed my eyebrows were in need of some clean up.  I had never noticed this before because my eyebrows are thinning and I never have to pluck them.  She did an eyebrow wax and they look really good.  I am glad that she noticed and recommended the eyebrows. It really made a big difference.
