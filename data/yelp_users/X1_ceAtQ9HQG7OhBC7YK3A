This hotel is incredible! They have an amazing staff and wonderful sense of hospitality. They sent up 2 free bottles of champagne and a cheese plate for my friends bachelorette party. They also made fresh nachos using chips that we brought that were healthier than most. The kitchen staff came up to retrieve the bag of chips and made fresh nachos with them at 3 o'clock in the morning!! Super accommodating hotel. Very impressed :)

I wish I could give it 0 stars. I can't get over how rude the bouncer was. First of all, it was my friend's bachelorette party. Is it just me or when it's someone's bachelorette u say yes to letting them in anywhere. We were a group of beautiful l, late 20 year old  women, dressed top notch, in elegant and chic attire. We were sweet and looking for a great time to celebrate such a milestone event. I'm appalled that any bar would reject a bachelorette. There was absolutely no need for that. I will never return to this place as I prefer to spend my money at establishments who hire people with souls!! Get rid of your wannabe rent- a -cops/ Napoleon syndrome bouncers.
