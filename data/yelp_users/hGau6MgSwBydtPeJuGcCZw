I use Jeremiah on a pretty regular basis for deliveries to clients, but I recently sent a bouquet to a friend and she was kind enough to send me a picture.  Perfection!  I love what he did with my pretty vague request. Green, purple and fuchsia colors became the perfect for her arrangement!  They are always super kind on the phone and I've never heard of an arrangement going astray. I was shocked at what she received for what I spent, but in a good way.

First off I want to say thank you to Rula Bula for allowing a large Wednesday group to monopolize a fairly large part of their restaurant last night.  We had a double birthday which drew out about 25 of us.  We were seated, served and managed by two very capable servers.  This isn't why I'm writing the review though.  Like most "Iron Druid" fans I associate Rula Bula with Fish & Chips which is what I always order here, but last night my boyfriend and a few others ordered the "Comfort Food".  Good Gravy!  This was amazing and now I can't imagine trying anything else.  Do you like Mac & Cheese? Do you like fried chicken? Bacon? Brown Gravy? Do yourself a favor and make the trip to Downtown Tempe.

After winning a few tickets to a show at the arena we decided to grab a bite to eat near the Venue.  Took a look at the menu and it looked pretty reasonable so my dinner companion and I accepted the hostess' offer to dine.  Aside from what seems to be a very clumsy wait staff (there were no less than 4 spills and crashes of dishes hitting the floor during dinner) they were attentive and did a good job of taking care of us.  Too bad the food didn't live up to the service.  My friend's chicken was a little too pink for eating *I wish he had told me while we were there, that would have come off the bill for sure...* and while my dinner was adequately cooked it didn't really match the description.  OH, and yeah..... I also experienced what I would call "mild food poisoning".  Hello mouth watering not in a good way.  Tums anyone? Gatorade?  Not the what I want out of my "memorable" dining experiences.    M.

The owner/designer Rachel answered the phone and within just a few hours emailed me a photo of and receipt for the cutest arrangement!  I order flowers as little pick-me-ups for clients and while we don't want to break the bank, we for sure want the arrangement to look classy and posh.  Perfection!  And BONUS - if the delivery is in Scottsdale she said there isn't a delivery charge!

I can't rave enough about the carne asada tacos. They are supreme! Having a traditional salsa bar is also top notch. Love this place.

So good.  Like, I drive out of my way to hit up this Brew Pub.  I don't even like chicken that much and I can't stop ordering the Jalapeno Popper Chicken Burger. It's juicy and flavorful which I'm pretty sure involves some sort of black magic.  The bartenders (I've only sat at the bar) are very helpful in discerning which of their wonder-brews will please your palate and if you can't decide order a flight!

Don't judge this restaurant by its exterior. Good fish and well done sushi. The staff and sushi men are fantastic and have a great memory for return customers! An oasis in the TJ Maxx parking lot.

I wish a there were 1/2 steps to the review stars.  We order take out from this restaurant about once a week.  I have only a 50/50 shot of getting what I ordered.  Today a sub black beans in lieu of rice came with neither, so I walked back across the street to fix it and was met by the take out person telling me "that's not what the ticket said". I'm sorry that the guy answering the phone didn't enter what we repeated back and forth three times, but I'm not sure how that is my fault.  I order, he repeats back, I repeat as confirmation.  It's usually a good method!  When did an apology for screwing up my order get left off the Customer Service check list?  Once I dumped the black beans into my mahi bowl it was edible, but too salty.  (That's saying a lot, usually I crave salt after a jaunt into the AZ heat.)
