NO STARS! HORRIBLE customer service after 10 minutes got water after 10 more minutes got my bf sprite after 10 more minutes got chocolate shake after 45 minutes more turns out they never put the food order in! How do places like this stay in business?? Don't the owners care? Wasted several hours of my Saturday and left without being fed totally pissed me off! The fact the employees are careless pissed me off too no standards no accountability, all that's left is a BAD review. (Went to Fuddruckers next door in and out in 30 minutes for 3 peeps no problems at all)

The Walgreens I've always dreamed of... Lol.. Ever since They did a remodel this place is excellent!! It's the Costco of Walgreens. There are aisles upon aisles of stuff and they're open 24 seven. Fresh food brought in daily like at QT. Photo products also 24/7. Friendly staff and Super clean store.. During regular hours there is also a take care clinic. Nice!!!

This was my second time seeing Dr. Doulas Smith. My first appt as with the other reviews for this office did require things that were not covered under insurance... Which happened to be around $220 I was a bit surprised as he said I had a simple ear infection and was told that I just needed antibiotic's, however he was very pleasant and addressed all my concerns in my appt.

Check em out

Family Owned with Homemade food! No powdered eggs here. This is my 5th visit in 3 months. (Usually cuz I don't eat breakfast) Awesome cook who CARES about the food he prepares!! Small dining area so they fill up quick like most East Valley Cafes but Fast Service gets you in and out with a full stomach of REAL food. Friendly and accommodating serving staff! Give the Little Kitchen a try and support small/local/family business! Not crappy careless Corp Denny's down the street with lower quality food then "Govt Cheese"

We came here to eat ice cream for my dads birthday since it's the only parlor in the area, the grandkids loved the arcade and the huge portions. Since the main attraction is the ice cream naturally its pricier... The pink chairs and booths are cute and add nicely to the ambiance without taking over to make guys uncomfortable lol!

Excellent! Made reservations but were about 10 minutes late due to the parking around mill ave..walked in and walked past others waiting, sure enough they had a booth not a table just as I requested! Which on a busy Friday night is lucky anyway. We had drinks n soup on our table literally within 5 minutes of walking in, appetizer came out just as we finished our soup, and the meal followed right on time! Hot n fresh food and an excellent waitress, perfect! We'll b back.

Does 4 stars seem high for an auto store? I gave this auto zone that bcuz they had a good selection of steering covers and car smelly goods which is what I came for great customer service too plus I guess I needed some antifreeze which was on sale. I'll be back!

It seems crazy to give a fast food restaurant a five yeah I know... But when everything always comes out fresh and just how you ordered it what else do they deserve?!? This can only be guaranteed when Thomas is working "the night shift" lol he's the best manager ever!! He actually gives a .... : )

Bagels are top notch! Best when toasted! Plump and moist not dry and flat. Super fresh each morning totally incredible and worth a drive for these bagels. Their inside seating area is nice, no smiles from the back staff (food prep etc.) but the cashiers super friendly and makes up for it. They have several different kinds of bagels( you can buy one or a dozen )and cream cheese, muffins, pastries, Iced Coffees and Smoothies too. Open for breakfast and lunch. Highly recommended!

Wow.. He's right this place is a joke! Bad food and service... The nice manager tried to make it right but she's not the one cooking! After being ignored while waiting to be seated then getting yucky food. Crazy you'd get soggy flavorless pizza at a "Pizza Kitchen" ps I've been all over Cali and had excellent pizza's ...."they" would be ashamed of this place!

Tried a pickup of some food other than pizza n wings... Philly Steak Sandwich and Club Sandwich, It was HORRIBLE looks and tastes like it was made yesterday. Old hard bread, old yesterday's bacon and fries that had been under the heater also since yesterday. $20 bucks now in the garbage can..and still hungry! Won't b back.

We've been here b4 with no major problems but today was horrible! Everywhere had a wait this morning.. Now i know why Fran's didnt. Hardly anyone there yet we waited almost 15 minutes to have our order taken.. From that point on nothing but bad service the waitress acting so busy hardly doing anything and once the food finally arrived it was a total mess and just completely tasteless? Mess up bacon n eggs really???? Won't b back here.. Next time we'll b waiting "somewhere" for great food! Sorry Fran your employees aren't doing a good job for your business at all.

A Hidden Gem!! I stopped in for lunch and was very impressed by the menu as it had many "favorites". So I went with the all beef hot dog w/fries for a quick lunch and was super impressed that it came freshly prepared on a slightly toasted bun with hot shoe string fries. I will be back!

Used to come here all the time before they supposedly updated their establishment..  More like downgraded, their food is horrible now! Weird wanna be american sports bar atmosphere, out of several items just that day supposedly. Bad service and bad food, won't be back here.

All Pom's Welcome! This was our first time using a mobile groomer and we are very happy with the services Nyah's Mobile Grooming provided! After several bad experiences at Petsmart Grooming and Several other local groomers with choppy cuts, services paid for not provided, nail injuries and finally a neck injury to our dog caused by falling off the grooming table and hanging from the leash, we decided that it was time to have the groomer come to our house(after 2 year recovery/waiting period : / )to get one on one service. After lots of review reading we chose Nyah's and feel like we hit the jackpot. Deon is such a pet lover and a wonderful groomer with compassion that you rarely see in today's workforce. She does the grooming in her enclosed work trailer type thing and her team was also very friendly and easy to have around our home. I would highly recommend using her company, not just your dog but you'll feel like the lucky one toooo
