This place has went down the drain. From one of our favorite weekly visits to probably some of the worst customer service. Very disappointed to what this place has become

Best fish and chips in town. Very clean environment  and the service is even better. Fresh fish. Recommend to anyone! Try the philly fries !

Honey hot wings were probably the best wings I've ever tried. Pizza hit the spot big time. Definitely started a new Sunday tradition. Even there ranch was good. Chicken parm sandwich was better then other Italian joints. Will be a long time customer

Delicious fish and chips. Always get a order of chicken cutlet to go along with it. Great food. Delivery is pretty impressive and the food is always warm and fresh. Can't beat the prices either. If you haven't tried it make sure you stop by

Me and my friend come here multiple times a week for the plates. Such great food! Best middle eastern food in the valley by a long shot! If you're sick of searching for a good place that serves authentic food, rest assured. You've found you're looking for.
