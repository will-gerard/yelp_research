Pizza isn't my favorite but the pepperoni we had was good. What I really liked was the calamari. It was an appetizer but plenty enough for a meal for one or two ppl. It was $10 but worth every penny. Delicious!

Only 4 stars .. because, well... Who likes to sign up to make car payments when you haven't had them for 10 yrs??  Ha ha. But seriously I have to say my recent purchase was about as smooth and painless as anyone could hope to expect when purchasing a vehicle. When I first started thinking about buying, I drove new with Shane. Before that, I would not have considered buying a Hyundai for myself as I've always been a Car Snob. The Hyundai that someone else in my family owns has always been reliable and comfortable though so I figured I would give them a chance. I was in no hurry to buy when I went in for that first drive though. A month later, I decided against new and went to look at some used that I had seen on the website inventory page. I was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by a FEMALE sales person! Eunice was GREAT. No pressure. Made me feel like she genuinely just wanted to help me get what I was looking for. The other thing I really liked is she knew her products. She answered all my questions abt "what does this do?" "What does that light mean?" "What is the difference between Tucson v Santa Fe in terms of gas mileage??" When I wanted to see a vehicle on the Honda lot, she went over with me and helped me test drive and compare. That was an unexpected bonus too. I have been happy to see women in car sales before only to be very disappointed that they didn't know A THING about cars. Not even the ones they were supposed to be selling. This is my 2nd vehicle purchase from Earnhardt. The last one was a Honda - long ago - and that didn't go as well as I would have liked. I accompanied someone else when they bought a Toyota from Earnhardt and that went okay. The fact that I didn't leave the finance office feeling traumatized like years past .. Just felt like they were being cooperative and trying to get my financing through (the one who helped the most was Pete D. - I think I also met another guy (Max? - not sure) - anyway, I would not hesitate to return to another Earnhardt or Earnhardt Hyundai for my next car buying experience. THANK YOU, EUNICE! Ladies .. Ask for Eunice!

Working at a school in Maryvale, I see a lot of animals that are not loved and cared for. When some students brought in kittens they found this morning, I couldn't sit around and not do anything for them. The kids' parents deny owning any pets and had no idea where the kittens may have come from. On the way to Sun Valley (the no-kill I am most familiar with), I realized they did not open for 2 more hrs. I found this office with my GPS and was very worried they would send me away. But - no! They were caring and compassionate and the vet said they could help me out. Thank you to all the ladies who helped me bid farewell to the tiny little kittens. I do hope they are okay.  Thank you to the vet at Glenfair!

Wildflower is my go-to place for lunch at least once/wk. I have never been disappointed with the food. Always delicious. I agree with some who say they need to make sure there is more than one register going at busy times. I have seen long lines waiting for one person to ring everybody else more than once. So I try not to go when they are busy. Yesterday I tried a soup I had never seen on the lineup before. Tomato based seafood chowder. It was To Die For. Haven't had any that tasty since I was sitting next to the ocean in NE. It makes me wish it was chilly here so I could eat their soup more often. *wink wink* 5 stars!

Updated: Wildflower, you know I love you. But when I arrive by 1:00 or 1:30 on a Saturday to be told that you are *already* out of the only reason I came to see you (the tomato based seafood chowder), well .. I find that frustrating. It would be less so if it happened once. But now it's happened twice. On two consecutive weekends. I could understand if I was going in really late for the lunch crowd. If they ran out of soup at 3 or 4 in the afternoon, that would be perfectly understandable. But the seafood chowder is only available two days. Maybe I will have to switch and try to make it on Wednesdays since they aren't as busy during the week. Or I will have to go ask for it right AFTER BREAKFAST so I can be assured they won't run out.

Yet another update: fully expected them to be out of seafood chowder because I didn't get a chance to go by until after 3:00. Guess what? They still had some!!

This is my favorite mani/pedi place in Goodyear. Consistently good srvc and you can't beat their prices. I've had waxing done here a few times too. No complaints.

OUT OF MARGARITAS  ... This should not happen in the middle of the day.

so now they have been "out" of margaritas abt 3 times .. by just 2:00-3:00 in the afternoon. This used to be one of my favorite places for a quick drink and lunch but after being told they are out so many times, I can't count on them anym ore. If I want Chipotle, I'll go to another one. And I'll read their yelps first to make sure they have higher ratings.

My salmon was perfection. The vegetables and rice were divine. Our service was good and we didn't have to wait too long for dinner on a weeknight. We will definitely go here as regulars.

Setting: Saturday evening - a little early for dinner but my son had skipped lunch playing at his friend's. It was barely 5:00.  First strike. We waited 5 mins even though more than half the tables were empty. We should've been seated immediately. The man behind me asked, "Really? We have to wait and there's 10 tables ready right now?!?!" The hostess said something about new wait staff coming on and she wasn't sure who was assigned to which tables .. something like that.  2nd strike. After we were seated, we waited another 5+ mins for a wait person to appear. I had to ask her for a kid's menu.   All I ordered was a drink and the kid ordered some wings.   I sipped at my margarita and almost gagged. It was like I had ordered a large SALT WATER. Looking at the bottom of the glass, there was a pile of salt clearly visible. GROSS! Now I know the rim usually has salt around it but I've never had a margarita with salt actually in the drink. It was awful. 3rd strike.   I had to ask the waitress to take the drink off the bill. The glass was still full and I lifted it to show her all the salt in the bottom. No apology. She acted like that was no big deal.   But she did take it off the bill.   Learned my lesson. Won't return. NYPD Pizza is closer to me anyway.

My long haired cat was getting a little stinky ifyouknowwhatImean .. and I knew all the groomers would be busy on a Saturday but it wasn't anything I could take care of by myself so I *had* to call around and beg. I think the lady I spoke with said her name was "Cara" but I'm not positive abt that. She was very nice though and accommodated us. She said she only had one feline groomer but that if all I needed was a quick sanitary/hygiene clip, they could fit her in. The groomer took her right back and I didn't even have time to turn on my phone before she was bringing her out again. Smelling much better! I will go back when I have time to get my cat the full service detail.

Kind of hard to find - tucked away in an alley. It's tiny inside but there's additional seating outdoors. Of course it's only nice enough to sit outside here a few months out of the year IMO. Had a muffin and a chai. They were good. Nice and quiet. Perfect for reading or visiting with friends. I liked it.  :-)

A little difficult to locate FOL but SO GLAD I did! Had the shrimp creole the first time I went and spicy gumbo the 2nd time. Both were delicious. Once for dinner - once for lunch. Good service both times. Will definitely put this on my list of places I frequent .. well, *frequently.*  ;-)

I LOVE the food. And we had good service .. *except* I hate it when they don't take your plates when you're done. Our waitress came and went from our table 3-4 times and ignored the plates every time. I usually tip 20-25% but this time .. somewhere between 10-20% was all i could muster.

I stop by and get gumbo or chowder to-go from this place for lunch once / week. Recently waited over 15 minutes .. which is strange because the 2 things I ordered (seafood gumbo and banana pudding) should already be prepared. Just put it in a container and I'm on my way. Usually out of there in 3-4 minutes. Not kidding. I go after the rush so I know they aren't too busy. But Friday my experience was not good. I don't know how they dropped the ball but I finally asked what the hold-up was on my gumbo. The person I spoke to at the register was gone in the back for more than 5 minutes. So now I have waited over 20 minutes for something that has never even noticed taken 5 minutes on previous occasions. When she came out, she had my order and said it was the banana pudding that had been holding everything up. So I don't understand how that could be but if someone is expected to wait 20 minutes for gumbo and dessert, I wish they had told me there was something going on with the pudding and I could have skipped it. In any case, the food is absolutely wonderful - the closest you're going to get to anything resembling the delicious Flavors you love from Louisiana around here. So I am sure I will continue with my lunch obsession and be here again next week .. I just needed to vent.

The exterior appearance belies the pleasant and appealing interior .. and doesn't tell you how great the food they create inside will be. So don't let it sway you. Go In! I've been here several times and have always had excellent srvc and great dishes.

I've been here a few times and always left Very Happy. (Even tho no one has ever offered me wine! Then again, I go in the mornings .. so .. little early in the day to start That!) Casey did my disgusting hair today. Seriously, I have days of Pool Hair going and had it all piled on top of my head with an anchor. Too much of a mess for me but she tamed it down and trimmed it without lecturing me (like my regular stylist does). They're very close to my house but I love my regular lady so I don't go here often. My girl isn't in on Mondays (elsewhere) though so I was very glad to see Karma takes a day off on Sunday instead of Monday. In and out in less than an hour. A big plus!  I don't remember the names of the other stylists I've used but Karma is definitely a place I will go again. Great job.

I bypass the Thai Orchid which is very close to me and go to Sala Thai instead now. (I reviewed Thai Orchid previously. I won't go again. The owner has made me feel less than welcome every time he has been there altho the wait staff and the non-grouchy co-owner are great.) I always receive fast friendly service at Sala. They have more lunch options at a great price, great srvc(!), and they have re-done the interior. I have been there for dinner several times and was very pleased with the prompt arrival of everything we ordered. I think the food is very good and consistently hear praise from anyone else who joins me there about it too. I know one reviewer said the food was not good and I would strongly  disagree.

Just needed a little tweek for my bike and my son's. Tightening up seat and handlebars, air up the tires, replace reflector. You know .. little things. Took my bikes here bc it's the closest place. Here's everything they did right. Greeted me quickly and politely, helped me unload the bikes, did all my requested tasks in a timely manner (15 minutes!), loaded the bikes back in the truck, and best of all .. didn't charge me a dime! Now .. here's what they did wrong. ...  *crickets*  See what I did there? Seriously. I could not have asked for a better experience. I will definitely use them again .. and refer my biking friends over there. They had some beautiful bikes. Both expensive and not expensive.

I'll be honest and say that I went b/c I was on the hunt for a good margarita. I've had margaritas at all the nearby mexican food places (Manuel's, Chili's, Chipotle) and I wanted to give the Raul & Theresa's new location a try. The only one I saw on the menu was only $5 so I didn't have high hopes for it. It was a mix - which I think is LAME for a mexican restaurant - and not a very good mix at that.  Maybe there is a better one (top shelf?) available, I don't know but I couldn't even finish it. I had a burro and the meat inside was good but it wasn't anything special. It's called a restaurant, but I felt like it was only slightly better than any of the other fast food mexican options around. I'll go back to Chipotle next time. Their margaritas are excellent and less than five bucks.

I usually see Dr. Trinka for adjustments and he is wonderful. I came for a massage today though with a recommendation to ask for Sylvia. I had requested her before and then ended up with another person. So today I know why my friend told me to go back and insist on seeing Sylvia. I thought the other massage was good but..  WOW. No it wasn't. Sylvia put her to shame! My one hour felt like 15 mins.! She found muscles I didn't even know I had and massaged them! The pressure was perfect. The music was low and relaxing. Not too much talking. She didn't make me feel like she was in a hurry. Slow movements and really concentrated on where I needed it most. EXCELLENT.

I thought the food and the service was great once I was seated. I will say though that I have been twice late in the afternoon (2-3 PM) and both times there was no one to greet me and I waited a long time for someone to come out of the back (kitchen?) to take me to a table. If I wasn't craving Thai, I would've walked out and no one there would ever even have known I was waiting. This place is not that far from my house and I'm not going back to the Thai place on Indian Sch (Thai Orchid) but when I get tired of being ignored upon entering (and I will), I will drive further to Sala Thai on Litchfield/VanBuren. It is very good though and a pretty little place. (It used to be Picazzo's pizza.)

I've been here several times now for lunch and I took dinner to-go a couple of times too. My only complaint abt this place was that there is no one to greet or seat you upon entering. That appears to be fixed. The service was great. Food was delicious. I'm so glad this new place opened. I actually drive past Thai Orchid to come to this place now.

In general, I usually love Chipotle. And the food was as good as it always is. But on a recent Thursday at 1:30, I was told they are OUT OF MARGARITAS?!?!? What? What? What? Dang. I would've gone to a "real" mexican food place if I had known that. The drink was my main reason for going out to lunch today and Chipotle has a margarita recipe that is Very Good .. and reasonably priced. I was disappointed on this particular visit.

Anyone know what's going on with the little trailer by parking? It says it's some ody-sea aquarium thing .. ? We've been here before. My 7 y/o boy loves it. Last time, there were no bees or ants. Now those are on display and I think he watched the bees go in and out for 20 m. The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is bc I think it's a bit overpriced - as is the cafe.

I've run in for lunch take-out here several times and I'm always very happy with my food. Prices are good. I've tried the big thick noodles (stir fry) with egg, shrimp, and vegetables once ( I wish I could remember what they are called but I can't.) And I've had pho (noodle/soup) a couple of times too. Very tasty. Very friendly, fast service.

Had such a great meal this evening. Started with sliders and a couple of drinks. The drinks were FANTASTIC. Not too strong but just right. Great taste, balanced and delicious. Main courses we ordered were the rib plate and a sandwich. The collard greens were too vinegar-y for me but the potato salad and Mac n cheese were delightful. Too full for dessert there but I brought my red velvet cake home where it didn't last the first hour. It was creamy, moist, and the sweetest most flavorful frosting I've ever had anywhere!    Some places have very limited choices on their kids menu but not the Hammered Hog. They had several options. Our two boys were happy (and full) after their meals. Very kid-friendly.   We will definitely go again. So glad we decided to check them out after seeing it on "Check Please Arizona."

Today was my 3rd visit to Oregano's in Goodyear. I have been to other locations and knew Oreganos's had really good food so I was pumped when they opened one near by. My first and second visit fulfilled or surpassed expectations but today .. *thumbs down.* I specifically stated "no bell peppers please" in my antipasto. I thought the server wrote that down but when my salad arrived it had A BUNCH of horrid red marinated peppers hidden inside. I ate a few bites off the top but it was ruined for me as soon as I saw the peppers. The server did not ask if everything was okay nor did she ask why I wasn't eating the salad. I have to confess I did not ask to see the manager while I was there. But it was one of those things that, the more I thought about it after I left, the more it bothered me. I paid around $12 (with tax) plus tip for a salad that should have been two meals. I didn't even get one out of it.    I emailed guest services. I know the service there is usually better. I will update if they reply at all.

The wait times are Ridic. We came on a weeknight for dinner bc we've only tried on the weekends before and the wait times are too long. (Anything over an hour is too long IMO.) So even last night (a Thurs evening), we waited almost an hour. Usually I am good to wait as long as I have a glass of wine but with these temperatures (it's summer - so over 110 out), even a glass of wine can't cool me off in their bar bc IT'S OUTSIDE. What were they thinking with that plan???   The food is delicious though. We've had pizza there, wings, and I had the Caesar with chicken last night. The chicken is some of the best I've ever had on a Caesar anywhere. And I get around!  I had a salad last time I was there too and I specifically stated no peppers. None of that yucky marinated peppers / pimento business. Ugh. And there was A PILE of them on there when it arrived! (it was another salad. Not the Caesar.) The waitress never asked me if everything was ok but you'd think she would notice I hadn't taken two bites off my salad when she picked up the plates. I emailed corporate to complain and they sent me a $10 gift card. (It was a $12-14 salad but I was just glad they made any effort to fix the situation since it was totally ignored when I was there at the restaurant.)   Four stars instead of 5 because the wait times are crazy no matter what day or time you go apparently. That is just poor planning. Same as putting the bar area outdoors. Dumb.

Superior service! Greeted when I walked in the door even though there was another customer already speaking with an employee. The quoted price was exactly what I was charged. It was ready sooner than they said it would be. Had the glass replaced on an iPad 3 for $130. I will probably have them do my cell phone since it has cracks too.   The iPad 3 looks brand new. If there was a 6th star, I would give them all 6!

We've been to AC twice now and had a good experience both times. I have been a faithful patron of Flavors of Louisiana for my Cajun fix for the last couple of yrs but I think Angry Crab is going to steal some of their business. Dinner a couple of weeks ago in the middle of the week was great. They weren't too busy and we had good service and the food was delicious. Lunch once and that was great too. Especially b/c it was a work lunch so there were 7 of us and they took really good care of us all. Tonight I ordered 2 to-go meals. (I wasn't cooking after Luke Days!) I was very impressed that the lady who took my order called me right back to tell me my dinner came with an additional side. (Instead of throwing something I didn't want in there.) I ordered a side I hadn't had from Angry Crab before and was looking forward to trying it. We arrived home and it's not anywhere to be found. Darn. This was around 8 o' clock on a Saturday night and they were VERY busy. No big deal. Kudos to the young lady for her effort. It was just lacking on the follow-through. We are still fans though and I'm still giving them all the stars b/c I should have checked to make sure everything was in there before I left and I am sure this won't keep us from going back next week!

Disappointed with the wait at another cajun place (Flavors of Louisiana .. only one person in front of me but I waited more than 5 minutes (!) only to have her tell me when it was finally my turn that I would have to wait an additional 10 minutes for gumbo to be prepared! Crap! That is WAY TOO LONG to have to wait on one little ol' cup of gumbo! Sheesh.  I digress.   Let's get back to the topic of Angry Crab (Goodyear locale). They saved the day!! I was so Put Out, I half expected to get some bad news when i went in to order but instead, they made me very happy, gave me a sharpie so i could add my name to the graffiti, and made the order in something under 10 mins. Oh! and they made my son some really good drink he loved while we waited. Thanks, AC, for satisfying my strong gumbo craving this afternoon. And for fixing my bad mood.
