I'd heard so much about Postino that I wasn't sure it would live up to the hype. Happily, it did! The atmosphere, the food, and the wine all measure up at Postino, the place that started the uber-urban renaissance at 40th and Campbell.  Postino is upscale, but not pretentious. The bruschetta really is out of this world, but the salads are incredible, too. Went there for lunch on a Friday and loved the diversity of the crowd. I also liked it that the noise level was reasonable, even when the place was packed.

What a wonderfully quirky spot this is. Walking into Enchanted Island is like stepping back in time. There weren't many people there on the day we were there, making it feel all the more surreal. The rides are old-school (some are actually antique), and the arcade games are covered in spider webs and dust. I know that doesn't sound endearing, but in this age of antiseptic everything, it kind of was.   The entire place has a very small-town, organic feel to it. You can get a corn dog and a Slurpee. You can put your kid on all kinds of coin-op rides that make them smile. The train ride is full of full-blown train whistles. This place is about as far from Disneyland as you could imagine, while still being an amusement park.   The downside: We brought our two-year-old, and unless you are willing to send your young toddler on rides alone, there are just three you can do as a family (the train, the carousel and the spinning cups). We also live near the McCormick Stillman Railroad Park, and Enchanted Island is going to cost a lot more than Stillman. Still, it's fun to adventure to a new spot, and we really enjoyed our outing.

My first trip to the Orange Table was less than memorable. The (greasy) breakfast just didn't sit well with me. But given the success of my second visit, I think maybe I had caught them on a bad day.  The Orange Table is locally owned, and it is somewhat hard to find. Once you make your way inside, the atmosphere is cozy and the service attentive. But it's the food that stands out here. Truly some amazing sandwiches. I ordered a chicken salad sandwhich. Sounds boring, but it was absolutely delicious. Makes me want another one right now. My friend opted for the Cortez, a tuna steak sandwich with avacado and other goodies that she couldn't stop raving about.

Awesome produce at great prices. Their produce guy even treated me to samples of a white peach and pluot -- just took his knife and cut a slice of each for me. Talk about customer service! Also love their bulk granola and good selection of beauty products.

There's something about Drift that I really like. The patio (which the owners plan to expand) is comfortable and the atmosphere is relaxed. The happy hour goes till 7, and yummy appetizers are all half price. Even better, they have a well-rounded drink menu that satisfies the beer drinkers and cocktails types alike.    The frat crowd can get annoying but if you set yourself up at a table on the patio, you'll have so much fun you'll hardly know they're there. Same goes for the ditsy servers.

A true Scottsdale tradition, Kyoto offers fabulous sushi in a dive-y yet oh-so-hip atmosphere. Their Tako Salad is one of the best and the teppanyaki tables (for those who want cooked food) really are a blast.  Kyoto's hidden secret is its great lunch specials. You can get your sushi fix for under $10 and avoid the crowds that come in the evening.  Bento boxes with terriaki chicken will please your non-sushi friends. I'm so glad this place survived downtown Scottsdale's growth spurt!

The last time I was at Bandera OJ Simpson was being chased down an LA freeway, so it was time to revisit this downtown Scottsdale favorite. A friend took me for my birthday, and I was surprisingly let down. The place really is too stiff for a rotisserie (as a fellow poster noted), and I think the prices are exceedingly high for mid-level food. Portions were small, and the staff was a little too formal for my taste. I don't plan to return.

What I love about Oregano's is that it never disappoints. The staff is always friendly, the food is always good, and the wait is long enough that you have time to enjoy a glass of wine (or two) before sitting down to dinner. I've been going to Oregno's for many years now and except for the time my car got towed from in front of the knitting shop, I've never had a bad experience.    Don't come to Oregano's if you're looking for nothing but food. Oregano's is all about the experience -- fun and casual, but not exactly a quick bite to eat. Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato Pizza is THE best and the Pasta Basta rocks, too.

This is such a sweet little spot. I had a friend visiting from San Francisco and she, along with my husband and I, arrived on a Saturday evening just as the (previously mentioned) wedding party had departed. We were greeted by the super sweet propietor and his wife. We ordered a drink (wine and beer prices were really reasonable) and took in the early 1900's bungalow where the restaurant is housed. There was so much character here (and so few TVs!) I really felt like I was back in Oakland.  We were seated quickly on their lovely patio. It was a gorgeous night and the ambiance was absolutely perfect. Our server admited to being a bit overwhelmed but still managed to give us prompt, humorous, and personable service.  We had brushcetta and a salad for an appetizer. Both were good. For dinner we each ordered a pizza - margarita (excellent), capricciosa (good), and salsiccia con patate (excellent). My SF friend was not as impressed as I was, but I truly enjoyed the food and the overall experience. Will definitely be back. Oh! And we found it on Yelp!

Chelsea's Kitchen has become my favorite dinner spot. The food is excellent, but it's the attitude of the place that really makes it sing. A great place for a nice, but un-stuffy, dinner. Try the steak tacos ~ you won't be sorry!

Stopped into Sauce for lunch yesterday and was delighted by the bustling little place. The menu offers a nice, but not large, selection of interesting pizzas and salads, plus a trio of lasagna offerings. We opted for a potato rosemary pizza, mozzarella and tomato salad and a chicken walnut salad. All were truly yummy ~ the pizza being my absolute favorite. I was surprised that the tomato mozzarella was lettuce salad. The pizza is served on a light crust, so not overly filling. Mom and I also indulged in a good glass of pino grigio. Total tab: $30.  The one hiccup in the place was service-oriented. This was the day after Christmas, so the place was packed. We ordered our food and drinks, but were told there weren't any seats available inside, and that our wine was not allowed on the outside patio. I asked the guy taking our order what he suggested we do, and he said we should not get the wine. Now, this was a mother-daughter shopping day, and we were going to have a glass of wine ~ we were actually thinking about going somewhere else when a manager-looking type said he had found a two-top for us. It was a cramped table, but we appreciated his service, and would only suggest finding a better solution than "don't get the wine" for future lunch and dinner goers.

After seeing so many gorgeous photos of the Clarendon's roof-top bar, we made the trek over to check it out. Let's just say they have a fabulous photographer because this place is really a dump.  The roof-top deck had no bar service (you can carry your drinks from the ground-floor bar). Mix that with peeling paint chips on the astroturf-ish deck, no music and rickety chairs ... it wasn't a winning combination. We quickly left and found another spot that was a bit more welcoming.  We did get a peek at one of the rooms on our way out and they looked nice. Still, I would be hugely disappointed if I booked a room here.

I was so excited to see a hip new restaurant gracing the streets of my childhood stomping grounds that perhaps I set myself up for disappointment. Don't get me wrong, I really liked the place. The atmosphere was cool and the service was friendly, but the food didn't quite meet my expectations.  I opted for the seared ahi tuna salad. I think the tuna was a little too done, and the salad a little bland. Others in my party had a Mediterranean salad, quesadilla and burger. All were good, but not exactly outstanding. What WAS amazing was the artichoke dip and freshly fried tortilla chips we had as an appetizer. The onion rings weren't bad either.  So my biggest gripe really came in the finishing touches. Waitress forgets my wine, no biggie. Gives me a dirty appetizer plate, okay I'll ask for a new one. Brings our dinner fare before we've polished off our appetizers (or even had time to taste them), and I'm less understanding. The place seems to invite you in with a warm and cozy feeling, but once you sit down the hurried pace and cramped table made me feel like I was in a fast-casual joint wolfing down my food. Not great. Still, the place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood and I'll definitely give it another try.

Took my 3.5 year old here for a 5-year-old's birthday party last weekend. The kids loved it! The rides are perfect for the under-6 set, and the play structure in the back is fantastic fun. I only wish we lived closer because this place is great for a hot summer day or for a birthday party.  The parents seemed to love it here, too, because the kids were entertained and we could actually have adult conversation for about 2 minutes at a time while they were on a ride!

It's hard to complain about At One Yoga. The atmosphere is lovely and the instructors truly know their stuff. Cinta at the Phoenix location gives an incredible, truly amazing performance in her Tuesday/Thursday Hot Yoga class. She offers tons of individual feedback and is tough, tough, tough!  But of course I have something to complain about, and it's the price. $20 for a drop-in class? Seriously? I don't know who can afford that on any kind of a regular basis. Apparently, they're out there, but I'm not among the elite class. Sorry. At this price At One will never be my regular yoga spot. I suppose they're ok with that.

My husband and I watched Fine's as it was being built, so we were stoked to finally have a chance to check it out. We happened in on a Monday night because that's when we could get a babysitter. Turns out that's 50% off night, which might seem like a good thing except we were told at the door that the patio (where we hoped to have a drink) was completely booked with reservations starting at 6.   I was ready to turn around and leave since the brisk way that was relayed to us seemed really annoying. But it turns out they have a lounge area for people like us who just pop by for a drink. Great! Except ... the lounge area leaves a lot to be desired. We were separated from the rest of the patio and really couldn't enjoy the ambiance we had been so excited to experience. I think the worst part was that when we left at 6:30, the patio had maybe four tables with actual people sitting at them. Perhaps they should just stop taking reservations - especially on 50% off Mondays. Had we been lucky enough to get a table, we likely would have stayed for dinner.   On the plus side, my wine flight was nice and our server was enthusiastic. The complimentary popcorn didn't do it for me, though. And since this was actually my second trip to Fine's - the first being with a girlfriend - and my second time being disappointed, I don't expect to be back.

I have never actually eaten inside the Side Door -- we are strictly take-out customers here, and we are very satisfied ones. Their burgers are absolutely giant and really, really good. I've also had and loved the Italian beef sandwhich (french dip) and their Mediterranean chicken sandwich is awesome. My only complaint is the fries usually don't travel well and I've never been all that wowed by the pizza. But this place rocks as a great, inexpensive take-out option.

Tossed isn't awful, it's just boring. The atmosphere is boring, and somehow my Cajun shrimp salad was boring. I don't know how a Cajun anything comes out bland, but my friend ate the same thing and had the same review. I don't think I'll be back -- again, not because it was a terrible experience but just because it was so lackluster.  Oh, and a salad and iced tea for $14? Seems a little much to me, all things considered.

Like most people, I don't exactly look forward to going to the dentist. Let me just say this was one of the very best medical experiences I've ever had, if not the absolute best.  The office is relaxing, modern and full of things to keep you interested if you have a wait (including a computer for patient use and a break room with coffee and water). The staff is approachable and friendly. And Dr. Tran was kind, thorough, and gentle.  I actually look forward to returning!

Reading the reviews I was a bit skeptical, but this place was a great Monday lunch date for two girlfriends. The service was exceedingly helpful and happy, and the food was truly delish. I had the turkey panini with lentil soup, and it was seriously divine -- the soup in particular. My friend went with the capresese panani and loved every bite.  The decor is nice. The staff is nice. Parking is easy. Lunch specials are $8. Seriously, what more do you want?

The absolute best in customer service AND reasonable prices. Sarah came to my rescue when I broke the LCD on my Samsung for the 2nd time in six months. She gave me a loaner screen while my new one came in (took a day) and was just generally a joy to do business with. I'm a fan!
