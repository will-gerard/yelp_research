I'm a teriyaki fiend.  I buy all the expensive kinds of bottled teriyaki sauce from AJ's I make my own in all different ways I try every place that has teriyaki sauce on stuff  I was SUPER pysched to try Blue Fin  It was good. Great.  Few suggestions though.  I like spicy teriyaki sauce.  They serve a "spicy" version, but its not a different sauce.  It's just the regular chicken teriyaki with some red chile sauce drizzled.  I would have preferred just to put the red pepper from the shaker on top.... but alas.  Live and learn.  The women who work here are the CUTEST THINGS EVER!  They're sooooooooo sweet.  I loved them.  So yeah, this place is pretty darn great.

They totally woulda gotten 5 stars from me if the service wasn't as slow as it way.... Alas....  Their lobster bisque is awesome!  Can't wait for their Chandler location to open!

Total and epic fail.  I've attempted to go to this practice twice. I shoulda learned after the first failed appointment- however, the convenience of their location coupled with my laziness made me go in for a second attempt. Shame on me I guess.  The first appointment I had with them was "rescheduled" about an hour before my appointment to a different day altogether.  The second appointment I had with them was actually made for the Tempe location (when I specifically asked for the Ahwatukee location), and then when I tried to reschedule something- they didn't have anything with a doctor for another month.  Can't imagine actually being sick or super preggo and dealing with these types of issues!  Thus, I'm taking my vagina elsewhere.

Yes, it's annoyingly crowded all the time  Yes, the wait staff will all turn and say "HI!!"  "WELCOME!!!" "WE'RE SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE!!" when you walk through the doors.    Yes, the food can sometimes take quite a long time  Yes, it is a bit more expensive than other pizza/pasta type of places  However, despite all these things, I FREAKIN' LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!  I only order three things from Oregano's.  1.  Alfredo the dark with chicken 2.  Unlimited marinara pasta bowl thing with meatballs and peppercini's 3.  Pizzooookie.  Yummmmmm  The food is ridiculously large, so I find this place is much more affordable when I split an entree with a friend.  But yeah, I love this place.

I have a fond place in my heart for this establishment  I've been covering my all white meat rice bowls in their sticky spicy teriyaki sauce for 10+ years  I've lived all over the world  I always crave three things when I'm not living in Phoenix (or the USA) 1.  Skim Milk 2.  Mexican food 3.  Tokyo Express  Now pay attention  If you like spicy food and teriyaki sauce, here's what you should order  An all white spicy chicken teriyaki bowl 5 extra sides of spicy sauce A small salad 2 extra sides of salad dressing  Ok, so I REALLY like sauce.  Really.  This place makes me want to cry I love it so much.

Ok I LOVED their lobster dinner wtih mango risotto.  LOVED IT.  Well worth the $36.  Reason for 4 stars?  I didn't like their desserts.... which was what I was most excited for.  I got the smores tart, which was to be a graham cracker crust with chocolate ganache and marshmellow.  Sounds amazing, yes?   It was just ok. Reason for it just being ok, the chocolate ganache filling tasted straight up like pudding.  Puddin'.  Seriously. Big let down.  My hubby got the chocolate creme brulee.... and it... tasted just like..... wait for it..... waittttttttt for it................  PUDDIN'!  WTF?!!?  Aghhhhhhhhh!!!  I do, however, REALLY love that this place is BYOB, so I shall return and give them another chance at dessert.

I have a secret. I don't like greek food.  At all.  I hate olives, feta cheese, gyros, etc.  I brought my mom here for her birthday, and it was GREAT!  The entertainment was AWESOME and family friendly. Everyone in the place was laughing and having a great time.    My family very much enjoyed the greek food too.    This is where everything birthday/special occasion should be celebrated.  Hands down.  OPA!

Their ahi tuna salad is sooooooo good and cheap! Their beef stroganoff is awesome Their grilled cheese and tomato soup is great!  Try the food, you won't be sorry.

Ya know  One time this place made my tummy feel yuckie  Ever since then, I've had nothing but successes at this place.  I especially enjoy their tataki dishes.  I like the quality of their salmon.  I enjoy their martinis.  I like their happy hour.  I like that they'll feed me until late at night.  So yeah, after a few years, I like you Zen 32.

I would give them 5 stars. But I'm still not convinced of their consistency....  I've been to Zen32 probably 6 times in the past 6 months, and everytime... EVERYTIME it was awesome!  Amazing!!!!  Great happy hour prices Chopped wasabi Fresh fish Those mousse chocolate dessert triangles are amazing  I love you Zen32 I really do And I hope you stay awesome, and in another six months I'll move up to 5 stars.

I thought this place rocked.  We made dinner reservations for a Friday night for a table with a view. We were in the inside portion of the mansion with a large party.  The food was great, views were great, drinks were great. My favorite part was being handed a glass of sparkling wine as we entered.  Yay!  After dinner we explored the house.  Then we moved to the lounge and found a very, very entertaining and maybe drunk lounge singer (think of the band at the end of the Hangover movie)  I would definitely return for a fancy brunch or special night out.

I love Loehmann's Especially this particular location of Loehmann's  Here are my reasons: 1.  It's organized and clean.  Unlike Last Chance, Ross, Nordstrom Rack... which all give me a headache within 5 minutes, this store is like a normal department store, just cheaper. 2.  Everytime I go, its empty, like I have the store to myself 3.  Great deals  I recently went to Loehmann's in San Fran, and the same day I went to Nordstroms semi annual sale.  I saw at least 4 items at Nordstroms on sale, that I had seen at Loehmann's earlier that day for even cheaper!  I've also gotten Diesel jeans for 50$ from here... Betsey Johnson purses.... I love me some Loehmann's  Oh, and boys, their men's section is like a foot wide, so you may wanna skip this.

I used to like their food Honestly.  It was my one year anniversary. Me and me man went here to celebrate  I had a lobster tail And a filet  On the way home, I got violently ill Like, within ten minutes of leaving this place. And no, I only had a few glasses of champagne :)  I ended up going home, and laying on the floor for awhile crying, moaning, vomiting, etc  After about an hour, I couldn't take it anymore I called 911  The paramedics showed up, I was naked and crying on the floor.  It was a VERY romantic anniversary, let me tell you.  After a long night at Scottsdale Osborn hospital, it was determined that the lobster tail was undercooked/tainted and made me severly ill.  I'll never eat here again. Simply because I've never been so sick.  It's a shame though, because on the way down, the lobster tail had these cajun seasonings and really was exceptionally delicious.  HOWEVER I contacted Ruths Chris and they refunded my dinner amount, paid my hospital copay, and were SOOO nice and accomodating to my every demand.  Bravo.  Although, Boo for almost killing me.  Eh, I'm torn.

Took my boyfriend and family here for Sunday brunch  Ambiance of the place is impressive  Brunch consists of a menu and a buffet  The buffet is on the smaller side, but the quality of the items present were very good A few items available on the buffet were: Scones Pain du chocolat Some sort of egg fritatta with veggies King crab legs and claws Shrimpies Seafood gazpacho martinis Cheeses Smoked salmon Different pasta salads Then they had a dessert spread which was very impressive (alas, almost every item contained nuts, which I'm allergice too :(  )  We all ordered items off of the menu, then piled the buffet on top of that So we had a LOT of food  It was all very, very, very good.  I gauge all buffets on the Bellagio buffet.   So, on my Bellagio buffet rating system, this place gets 4 stars! (Bellagio is the only one that holds the 5 star rating in my meager mind)  Ta da! Go there for brunch!

I thought it was lovely.  I loved the proscuitto sandwich I had, I thought that the menu was concise and a perfectly priced.  I will return.

Better than the other fondue options.  I'm not a fan of their cheese  However, their Yin Yang chocolate fondue is SO FREAKING GOOD  So yeah. Darn.  I love the Melting Pot.

Einstein's is Noah's Bagels in SF  They're the same! Who knew!?  Anyways, I like the manager of this location.  He's always so friendly and seems genuinely happy to be there and talkin' with his customers.  I am obsessed with the jalapeno salsa cream cheese.  I literally buy 3 tubs of it everytime I go there.  My favorite items include Santa Fe bagel sandwich (jalapeno salsa cream cheese, turkey sausage, eggs, pepperjack cheese and salsa! YUM) Pepperoni pizza bagel  AND.  They have Mr Pibb on tap.  I love Mr. Pibb.  Don't know why, I just do.

I've been to this particular Outback twice in the past week due to Scottish family in town who are OBSESSED with this place  They're Scottish, who knows....  Well, at first I was skeptical.  But I thought the food was suprisingly tasty!  The second time, I'M IN LOVE!  I LOVE OUTBACK  Sweet chain steakhouse, how I love thee.  I swear their stupid horseradish crusted filet was just as good as the damned Flemings/RuthsChris/Mortons filets.  I was impressed.  Damn good green beans too.  I love.

LOVE THIS PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!!!!  OMG So good!  The crust is that like thin but crunchy kind, and the red sauce on the pizzas is absolutely perfect. I like their wide array of pizzas and toppings (even though I can't have any pesto pizza because of the nuts in the pesto, boo)  This place, and Classic Italian in Tempe are the best pizza places I've been in to AZ hands down.

Ok There is a sushi bar in this AJs And, from 2-4:30pm every day (including weekends) they have a sushi happy hour.  The sushi is soooooooo fresh, and with happy hour you can ordered 4 salmon nigiris for 7$ AMAZING  I've gotten to know the regular sushi chefs, and they're totally cool and will basically make me whatever I can dream up that day.  I love it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it. Mmmm, sushi.  (also, near the sushi bar theres a section of cold dips.  I happened across a very small container of "black diamond" brand dips.  I've tried a few, and found that the spinach con queso dip is TO DIE FOR.  Its pricey, 7$ for the small tub, but its so worth it.  Everytime I have people over I'll get a few of these black diamond brand dips and my guests love them too)

Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Had an appt for 1pm on a Tuesday, wasn't seen until 1:45pm. Problem wasn't fixed, so back in I went, this time Saturday at 12:50pm. Wasn't seen until 1:40pm.  At least the MVD has a tv and lots of chairs and places to wait.  This place is the biggest cluster@#$@#, and there is absolutely nowhere to comfortably wait for your appointment to be called.  So yeah, thanks Apple Store, I now dread you more than the MVD.

So I used to eat at this location  And I loved it  But slowly Each time I ate here  I'd get a tummy ache  Then my boyfriend was all like "hey, everytime I eat chipotle I get diarrhea"  So it wasn't just me!  We continued to eat here though, because we loved it. And we'd make sure we had no where to be for a few hours after eating it.  I know, we're weird.  But we got sick of getting sick.  Poo.

I was shopping at the mall, and I got hungry So I thought about my choices, and decided to try out PF Chang's.  I haven't eaten PF Chang's in like... 10 years.  I ordered their lettuce wraps, and man o man, I loved them! I could eat them every day.  So yeah, that's all.  I did like that when I told the server of my peanut allergy, she totally took it seriously and had the kitchen use separate pots and pans for my food.  I'm such a princess.  :)

In September 2008 I went to a pastry cooking class here.  It was at nighttime.  55$ a person.  from 6-9pm.  We show up, and the pastry chef was the pastry chef from Cowboy Ciao!!  OMG!!! I.was.so.excited.  I'm such a huge fan of the pastries at Cowboy Ciao since they're unique and weird and awesome.  Ok, so the class was super fun.  We had like... five or six different recipes.  We broke off into groups and each picked the recipe we wanted to make.  We made them, with the help of the chef.  It was fun, we were all talking.  They provide wine, and iced tea and water to drink.  Then OF COURSE.  Once they're all done, YOU EAT AND EAT AND EAT until you can eat no more.  Awesomeness.  I really had a great time.  Really.

Ok I lived in France  I adore French food  After reading reviews, I went to Zinc Bistro hoping to love it.  And I did  Blame it on the bellini and kir royale if you wish, but I thought this restaurant was top notch in all ways.  Our server was awesome, and very attentive.  Even though some people at my table didn't speak English very well, he was warm and accomodating.  The drinks were awesome, and I thought for the quality of champagne in my bellini and kir royale, very well priced  The inside of the restaurant was reminiscent of many brasserie's in France  The food was amazing.  We had a 5 cheese platter, and the waiter presented me with a listing of ten cheeses and let me pick out five.  I could only pick four, so left the 5th cheese up to him.  The cheeses were very French, and the two that were my favorite were the Brillat Savarin and the Epousse :)  For dinner I had the moules frites, and a side of the mac and cheese.  Both were AWESOME The moules frites were served in a white wine sauce and the mussels themselves were very large and tasted fresh as can be  The mac and cheese.  MMMM.  There were slices of ham inside, which was unexpected, but delicious.    My boyfriend, he got a filet with foie gras seared on top, all served on a plate with a wine reduction sauce. I tried this. And OMG I wished I had gotten it.  The foie gras along with the filet, was AMAZING.  Like, I'll dream about it for awhile.  I'll go back for this dish alone.  Again, I thought the $36 price tag for this dish was very reasonable.  The filet was top notch, and the foie gras  Oh the foie gras  How I love foie gras....  So yeah.   I really, really, really dug this place.

Suck.Suck.Suck.  All of the workers were teenage stoner types, who were completely oblivious to customers (am I really that old already?!)  It was like pulling teeth to find someone to answer any of my saltwater fish questions... and the answers I got were not helpful AT ALL.  The kids working there didn't know jack about jack.  I will not be returning.  Ever.   Which sucks, because they did have a very vast selection of fishies.  I just don't trust them.

I officially dig this place.  I like Time Out because: 1.  Super cheap drinks.  Super.  $7 for a pitcher of Shocktop, yay! $2 beers... yay! 2.  No stupid patio where I'll be forced to hang out with my stupid smoker friends and kill my lungs.  Dirty smokers must go outside to a non-welcoming patio... muuuAHAHAHA 3.  Very chill crowd.  It is rather hipster-y on the weekends, but they didn't seem pretentious at all to me.  They co-mingled with old kooky drunks that were strewn about the bar top very well.  So yes, I love you Time Out.  I really, really do.

Great, fantastic, awesome experience.  My friends from Romania got into town and for their first American meal, I took them here. I was hesitant, since I had never been here before, and saw the negative reviews here on Yelp.  I'm glad we went.  It was restaurant week, so we ordered off the prix fixe menu for $29 per person.    We got ahi, salads, filets, lamb, creme brulees, molten lava cakes, bananas foster.... oh my!  The Romanians had never had filet mignon, and didn't really understand it.   They kept eating it saying "how can it be so tender?"  "is this real cow, or fake?" LOL  The restaurant knew it was their first day ever in America, so the manager, the chef, everyone came over to welcome them.  In addition, they gave us the table with an awesome view of the entire city.    To conclude, our waiter offered to give us a brief tour, and photographed all of us together in various locations.    I really, really was impressed.

This place is always dead Makes me sad.  I freakin' love the sushi here!  VERY fresh.  Everytime I sit at the sushi bar the chef throws extras my way, which is much appreciated.

I am a fan.  Aside from the tacky decor.  Me and my mom can come here for a casual lunch.  Spend $6.99 for an order of mini chimichangas, split it!, and then leave full. (Always get a side of the delicious Baja sauce... mmm.... clogged arteries....)  Their portions are GIGANTIC, but it seems like they're working on that and may have improved.  I do love you Macayos.  You're easy, consistent, cheap, and tasty.

I would eat here everyday if I didn't think I'd end up 400 pounds...  Minus 1 star because each time I've been here the service has kinda sucked and orders have been messed up.  Regardless, their fried chicken on waffles topped with syrup and a slice of Red Velvet cake to top it off......... is sooooooo heavenly.

Borrrring.  This place was actually my first job ever.  I was 15.... ohhh, those were the days....  While I was 15, I tried everything on the menu... and I think my favorite item was the generic frozen then fried jalapeno poppers.  Ha!  As an adult of 27 years old, I decided to retry this old haunt, and found the food to be dull, boring, and quite frankly it reminded me of Lubys....  I do like their BBQ sauce though, and I always buy it at the grocery store.  See, I'm loyal!

Why 5 stars?  Freakin' awesome Mexican food, and CRAZY cheap prices!  So, I went a bit overboard (as always) in ordering. I just wanted to try so many different thingsssss  I got: Cheese crisp with green chile strips and guacamole Mini green chile chimichanga 1 cheese enchilada Side order of refried beans Chips and salsa  All that food... .$15 And it ended up being way too much food.  WAY too much.  I loved everything... EVERYTHING I SAY!  And that's truly a rarity.

Ok  Don't have their "grilled" eggrolls or crabpuffs They're soggy and floppy and just soooooooooo gross. Seriously.  Don't.  Their chicken bowls are pretty good though!  I would prefer their spicy teriyaki sauce to be less sugary... but it was definitely edible.

This food is tasttttttttttttttttyyyyyy  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM  Ok, I'm with Paul on one point.  The tour of rigatony's is HUGE and awesome if you're an undecided sort of person, like me  However, I had the rigatony's baked rigatoni.  OMG.  Authentic Italian?  Probably not.  The rigatoni consisted of noodles, covered in marinara (which is very excellent tasting), then topped with garlic alfredo sauce and melted mozz..... mmmm  Rich, decadent, satisfying.... I love.  Great service too.  My 5 star for Italian is still reserved for Va Bene, but... this place is pretty darn tasty.  Oh, and pretty cheap too!

I was SOOOO EXCITED to eat here.  For realz.  I love breakfast foods.  Of all kinds.  But I would rather eat at IHOP than this place.  Honestly.  I've tried all their variations on the eggs benedict, and found them all to be so disgusting they bordered on inedible.  A friend of mine insists that I should return to this place and order a "sweet" breakfast, but I'm scared and very hesitant to ever eat here again.

Ok The food here, its freakin' good.  Really good.  Like, no joke.    And from seeing this place, you wouldn't think it.  But their food, really is impressive.  And cheap.  Try their mini chimichangas... or their supergooeycheeseychimi (which is basically a beef chimichanga topped with tons of cheese and cream cheese and more cheese)  Their drinks are good and average  Good place for happy hour, or drinking during the day.

Love the food Make reservations, it gets busy.  No matter how many times I come here, I still can never find it... old town scottsdale is like my Bermuda triangle.....  I especially like the sweet and savory desserts that they carry.... bleu cheese cheesecake.... chipotle chocolate souffle.... mmmmm..... me love weird food!!!  The wine and drinks are above average, with an above average price tag.  So yeah, go there for a happy hour or a special occasion, it'll be good, promise.

They make their pancakes with peanut oil.  Which makes me sad, because I'm allergic to peanuts.  So yeah, until they use something else, I literally can't eat pancakes here.

I had a great time here!  The patio was fantastic and very comfy.  Lots of fire and couches.  The service was the best!  The drinks were tasty and super fun, as they were served in big bowls and tiki cups.  Pitchers of mojitos for $20?  Yes please!  I LOVED the food.  We had: Tuna Poke- Deeelish and a bit spicy, but nice and light Egg rolls things- Filled with shrimp, chiles and cream cheese!! Ribs, Potstickers, Steaks, Luau pork.... lots of different dipping sauces which were divine on their own  If only I lived closer.... I love love love it.

Yum, Yum, Yum.  It's spicy, so wussies take note.   I LOVE their blue corn enchiladas.... they're served on a big plate and all the sides run together and you can't tell what is what... MMM!  Their chicken enchiladas are also top notch.  Yum.  Highly recommended, especially for those with taste buds of steel :)

Yes, I'll say it. This is as good as it gets...  .... ..... for a sports bar.  I am in love with their golden sauces.  Mmmmmmmmmmm. I also love their focaccia sandwiches, wings, and chicken fingers.  So when I'm craving greasy, bad for me, bar food.  This is my first place of choice. Yum.

The ambiance of this place is a bit old peopleish  The prices are spendy  However, the food is outrageously good.  Lots of steaks, lobster, escargot, fancy french sauces, wines, and jazz.  It's pretty freakin' awesome, but wouldn't be good for people on a budget or people looking for a trendy restaurant to see and be seen at.

I took my Euro visitors here. I got them arrested I made them ride the bull  We went to the restaurant and I made them eat rattlesnake  FYI- The restaurant was excellent, had very tasty food, and awesome management and servers  So while I wouldn't come back here just any random day... next time I have visitors that want some cheesy souvenirs and rattlesnake... here I come Rawwwwwwwwwwhideeeee!

So, to be fair, I've never had any other Ethiopian food before.  Ever. And, this place always gives me a wicked stomach ache, so some sort of spice they use or something doesn't agree with me.  But, it's DELICIOUS! And it's vegetarian options are so tasty too!  So, I'll continue popping a Pepcid and coming here for years to come

I no like.  Will not return.  Ordered the lobster bisque, and was served a cup of what could only be described as lobster gravy.  Gross.    Then ordered the sweetbreads fettucine.  BLAND!  SO SO SO SO SO boring.    Not impressed, at all.

I agree with the poor reviews on this place. I have found the food to be expensive and very boring. The drinks are ok, the beer is ok, the atmosphere is ok.  It's very... ok.  Maybe if I lived in the neighborhood and could walk there I'd feel differently.  However, I don't, so I won't be returning anytime soon.  Oh, and it doesn't seem very Irish bar-ish to me.  They have Irish beer, and Irish type food, but thats it.

BETTER THAN PIZZERIA BIANCO Seriously.  Seriously, seriously, seriously good pizza.  The only thing that bothered me about this place.... the name.... I honestly can't stand the name of this place.....  However, the pizza is perfection. I can't imagine a better pizza.  It totally reminded me of the pizzas I've had in Italy and France, much moreso than any other pizzeria in the valley.  Loved it.  Really.

I'd go back. I don't eat burgers, so I oped for a grilled chicken sandwich... was pretty damn tasty.  My favorfite part is the self help bar with toppings and all the various dips! I helped myself to quite a bit of nacho cheese that I then dipped everything in.  Healthy.

This review is for their annual luau  I have not eaten at this establishment on a normal night, and can not comment on that.  Sooo, the luau. It was disorganized.  The food was brought out buffet style and hundreds of people rushed the table leading to a gigantic and very slow moving line.  By the time we made it up to the food table, everything was picked through and looked like a tornado went through it.  Drinks were not included, bu tthey did have cheap and tasty Mai Tais.  For the food we got to eat, I wasn't too impressed.   The beef ribs were way to fatty. The pork was so fatty I found the section I was given to be inedible. The corn on the cob was my favorite part.  So I spent around $40 to eat two ears of corn and a few drinks.  Le sigh. More organization and better food is needed for this event! I demand it!

For 55$ a night, you get  1.  A clean nice room (I thought it was just as nice as the rooms at Paris/Caesars) 2.  Great location on the strip 3.  Located directly next to the Ghiradhelli ice cream parlor :)  Can't beat it.  I'd totally stay there again, and I'm a bit of a snob.

Awesome caesar salad.  Really.  I love their caesar salads... which is kinda weird to say about a steakhouse....  I don't care.  I LOVE THEIR CAESAR SALADS!  I did once order the porterhouse for two, and it was ridiculously large.  Like, it could have fed a family of Somalians for a year.... or a black bear... it was freakin' huge!

The first time I went here, I LOVED IT! This time.... not so much.  We had awful awful awful service. Our server was slow, forgetful, and snotty.  YUCK.  I like the pomegranate seeds in the guacamole. I ordered the enchiladas suizas, and I found them to be oddly sweet and the chicken was chewy and tough inside.  I think this place has outlived it's useful lifespan.

Just remember this  HIT OR MISS  This place can be really really great and full of awesome bargains Or you can go on a bad week where you find nothing but stained/ripped crap  However, I've found some of the most awesome world-shaking bargains at this place.  $20 G Star jeans $40 True Religion capris $38 Coach shoes $30 Kate Spade purse  The lines can be long for the cashier, but they move pretty quick.  The dressing room is mostly community style, so wear undies.  The bargain hunter in me LOVES this place. The claustrophobe part of me hates this place. Luckily the bargain hunter part of me is stronger :)

Only came here for after dinner tropical drinks and dessert  Found the ambience to be nice, and we sat on the upstairs patio and were able to enjoy the beautiful weather  To drink I had a key west colada.  It was awesome.  Truly awesome.  The rest of the people in my party enjoyed various mojitos from the drink menu, and no one was disappointed.  We eventually ordered the Butterscotch dessert, and while it was only 1 dessert, it served all six people in my party. The dessert was HUGE and very rich  Very good though.  It was sugarcane and whiskey all whipped together with creme and then topped with chocolate ganache and caramel sauce....  MMMMM.......  So yeah, we had fun!  I would recommend, if only for after dinner drinks and dessert.

Tip:  Order a few sauces... we tried the chipotle aioli, the red wine reduction, and the somethingelsefrench sauce... and they really were awesome. Awesomely delicious.  To dip fries and burgers into.  Do it, do it.

It's like a motel 6, but with very trendy decor And of course the Sheep.  The hotel rooms are terribly old, the grounds are terrible old, all if very reminiscent of a Motel 6.  The clubs are crowded but fun.  Odds are you will see a celebrity or two, I sure did.  Don't think I'll be back anytime soon though...

Love it. It's like they sprinkle cocaine into all of their food to make it taste better.  I like going between 10am-11am which allows you to get charged for breakfast (14.95), but you get to enjoy lunch and breakfast!!  Many things I had here were the best ever.  For example -Their scrambled eggs were the best eggs I've ever tasted -Their eggs benedict were awesome -OMG, their FRENCH TOAST WAS AMAZING!!! -Chocolate covered strawberries for dessert surpassed Godiva's chocolate covered strawberries by far  So yeah. How the hell do they make their scrambled eggs taste like that?  I mean seriously.  Cocaine?  Pampered chickens that recieve massages and squirt out only the best tasting eggs?

I agree with Candace.  They let everyone in.  People were wearing jeans, tank tops and flipflops on a Friday night.  In addition, it was so crowded that everywhere I tried to stand one of two things happened: 1.  A bouncer told me to move 2.  Ugly girls started fighting  The music was terrible, and was a mixture of old school rap and top 40 hits.  BLAH.  Most of the girls in there were with bachelorette parties, as I saw at least 20 veils at one point on the main dance floor.  I no like.

I really dug this place. Really!  So, I'm trying to eat healthy (I've got some sweet ass vacations lined up in the next couple months that I'm gonna be smokin' hot for)  Anyways, this place has a lot of great healthy option.  I got the turkey flatbread, and asked for a half portion.  Done!  They were happy to oblige.  For a side, I got the roasted vegetables.  Delicious!  They were very, very well seasoned.    Add some organic green tea to drink.... perfect meal. I didn't even feel like I was dieting.    I shall return.

I was taken aback by how good I thought this place was.  The server was SUPER nice and friendly. The food was DEEEEEEEELISH  I *loved* all the different bbq sauces right there on the table.  Seriously, it was my favorite part.  Because I love sauce.  Lots of different kinds of sauces.  All over my tender meats.  Delicious.  The best part... how flippin' cheap it was!  We went during lunch time (which is 7 days a week), and I think my two meat meal with a side item and cornbread was like $7.99?  AWESOME! I'll return I'm sure.

Meh is right  I had high expectations.  It smelled delicious from the outside.  I love thin crust pizza.  I love fresh ingredients.  I love brick oven pizza.  I should have LOVED this place.  Unfortunately, I thought it was the epitomy of bland.    I got a small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. The toppings were not evenly spread across the pizza.  In fact, half of the pizza had no pepperoni and a few pieces of sausage on them?! (I hate sausage on pizza, blech)  The sauce was sooo bland to me.    The cheese almost had the consistency of low-fat cheese when it melts... like... rubbery.  Yep.  I won't come back.

I had the enchiladas verdes, and thought they were very good  *however!  they tasted just like the enchiladas verdes at Pink Taco.... which I think is a bit strange*  My friend had the chilaquilles and also found them to be very good  I was a bit put off my the lack of chips and salsa to start.  When I go to a mexican restaurant, I NEED CHIPS AND SALSA!  :)  Then when I requested chips and salsa, they looked at me like I was crazy, and then brought out a plate with 10 tortilla chips on it.  Great....  I'd go back, but don't think I'd go out of my way to do so.

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  I enjoyed the spicy scallop roll.  Oh how I love popping those meaty, cold scallops between my teeth.  YUM!  I have a nut allergy, and they were very accomodating and did not put macadamia nuts anywhere near my foods  :)  I shall return!

Downgrading Shady's rating based soley on how unfriendly the bartenders are.  I've been coming to this place for years, and STILL the dudes behind the bar act like they have gold shooting out of their bums and like I'm totally not cool enough to talk to them.  Seriously people?  You're bartenders.  The nicer you are to people, the more money you make. A-holes.

Ok, This place needs a major renovation. It's a throw back to theaters from the... 90's? But, I do enjoy the movies they play.  And oftentimes, the movies I want to see are ONLY playing here.  Bonus, it's next to lots of shopping and bars... so you can go to HH, get a buzz on, wander through the mall and end up here seeing a movie!

I have to agree with the other fantastic ratings I love the food  I'm not sure I'd ever go to the lounge/club in the back...  However, the food is excellent.    The spicy queso dip as an appetizer is something I dream about at nighttime  When you receive your bbq, you also get hot and regular bbq sauce on the side.  I love the hot.  Mmmmmm  The cornbread is awesome, the roasted corn side is awesome, the mac and cheese side is awesome.  The sides are so good I could almost just eat those.    So yeah, yay bbq!

I gotta say. I've been in here a few times and each time I had a great time!  Really great time!  Singing along at the top of my lungs to Billy Joel songs great time!  HOWEVER I've always stopped here after bar hopping a bit.  This was kinda the last stop... and we were all pretty buzzed each time we visited this place.  I dunno.  I have fond, fond memories of this place though.

Love it! The food is VERY spicy though.  Luckily, I have burned off all of my taste buds so far from all my mexican food endeavors, however, the wussies out there should take note :)  Just realize that this place is VERY small and can get VERY crowded.  I was there once and George W Bush came in to eat there.  Evidently he loves the food.

I'm picky about Mexican food.  I enjoyed the food here.  A lot. So much so, that I would like to come back, daily. But I'm not rich, so I won't  However! Here is what I loved when I ate here:  1.  Rocky Point Pizza- cheese and shrimp and mango sauce... SO GOOD!!! 2.  Spicy jalapeno sausage slider things.  Really spicy.  For realz.  But they have this delicious spicy mayo on them... OMG.  To die for. 3.  Mini chimis.  Succulent meat and cheese wrapped in a cute pocket and deep fried.  Need I say anything else.  So yes.  I'm a big fan.

Ate in the restaurant part. Had reservations.  Service was excellent. Server made many great recommendations  I particularly enjoyed the white peach and hibiscus margarita! YUM  I had the fish special, my man had the braised short ribs.   We also shared the antipasto appetizer platter, and really enjoyed it.  So yeah We really enjoyed this place.   I'm not a HUGE fan of their menu selections (they don't have any entree salads... the salads are all in the appetizer section of the menu and there are only two to choose from)  All in all, I like.

Ok Gross.  I could go on and on about why this place was terrible. I'll summarize instead.  1.  Their "sushi bar" is a joke.  They only have Krab products.  Thats it.  I grabbed a roll that looked like a Philly roll, only to find out they used carrots instead of salmon!??!  Sigh.  And gross.  2.  I didn't think the selection was great  3.  Some of the food was coldish....   That's all I got.  Its cheap, 8$ a person at lunch.   The only thing I found edible was the crab rangoon, and that even tasted like the standard greasy chinese delivery type puffies.  I'll never go back, I'd rather eat at McDonalds. And I hate McDonalds.

We went there pre-Live show, and had 2 for 1 drink tickets for this place  Neat looking lounge  Good music :)  Drinks were still expensive, even at 2 for 1, but the bonus was their well liquors were high end still.  So hooray!  Didn't stay too long.  It was a bit crowded and smokey.  But I'd totally go there again, especially since it helped get us super psyched for Love!!

I have a special place in my heart for this restaurant, as it was the site of my boyfriend and mine's 2nd date :)  However, their food is SOOOOO good.  And I don't think its because I'm biased.  I always end up getting their gnocchi with vodka sauce, because it is just that good.

Ok.  I had the guacamole, and the salmon with corn chorizo stuff OMG I loved loved loved the food!  Get the salmon entree, seriously.  I thought it was superb.  Delicious.  I could eat it everyday.  The inside part was kinda loud, kinda crowded, a bit irritating.  The patio looked nice, but it was way to hot to enjoy.  I'll come back for the salmon.  Delicious.

Yeah. This is like last meal type of good.  Duck fat fries were delicious. Rosemary bread was tasty but greatly overshadowed.  I got the American Kobe filet  with a foie gras bordelaise sauce along with a lobster tail, and the truffled macaroni and cheese. OMG!   Everything was the best ever.  My man decided to splurge.  He got the A5 Japanese hand massaged Waygu beef filet. HOLY CRAP!  This didn't even taste like regular steak.  It tasted like this magical whole other thing that comes from a place only inhabitated by unicorns and rainbows!  Alongside my man's fancy steak, he got roasted marrow bones and the mashed potato trio. My man scooped all the marrow out of the bones and put them on his fancy piece of meat.  For dessert, we got the beignets with creme brulee and chocolate pot du creme dipping sauces.  These were good, but drastically overshadowed by the entrees.  Upon leaving, we were given a bag of carmel-chocolate popcorn.  So yes, next time I want to live it up and drop $400 on one dinner, I'm coming back to this place!

Frickin' unbelievably awesome.  I want to go back every week until I've tried every single variation.  I had the carne adovada pasty.  Delicious, spicy, meaty... mmmm!  My man had the lamb vidaloo, and that was equally spicy and soooo tasty.  I got the banana carmel graham dessert thing too.  OMG!!!  So freakin' great.  Awesome.  Unbelievable.  Not sure I did the crampdness of the place, we ordered our stuff to-go and will probably go this route in the future.  Yum.Yum.Yum.

I thought that the food was EXCELLENT!!  I'm not sure if I loved the decor.  I felt... like I was in a futuristic hospital cafeteria... so that's where I'm deducting one point.    Let's see....  We had the beef dumplings two ways- Not the best or most exciting thing, but they were good  The ahi tuna with wasabi mashed potatoes was AWESOME!!! The half rack of lamb was AMAZING!!!  For dessert we had the cuban opera cake... that was just ok.  The service was top notch, and the server was constantly available and present without being obtrusive.  I love this place.  But the decor makes me not want to run back... just walk quickly.

Love it. Love it.  I'm slightly obsessed with their lemon ricotta pancakes.  I love their breakfast sausage.  I love their mocha drinks.  I love their prices.  I do not like the big lines that sometimes build up  But the food and cheap prices make up for it.  Love you Wildflower.

Ok I LOVE this place.  Wussies beware though, its rather spicy.  My favorite are the flautas appetizer.  Its enough for a meal for me.  Two large flautas are stuffed with cheese and beef, then drenched in a delicious red sauce.  MMMMMM!!!!  OMG They also have this berry chimichanga type dessert.  I dream about it at nighttime.

Eh.....  Tuesday night all rolls and apps are 1/2 off  The inside of this place is great btw.  I like the decor and music and drinks... hooray.  The sushi... well.... lets just say I was happy it was 1/2 off.  I would have preferred RA  I found the entire place to be rather.... well.... let's just say I think it'd be a good place for a beginner sushi eater to try.  Their rolls mostly contain fake crab.... shrimp.... pretty unexciting things.  They didn't have Uni at all....  Their salmon nigiri was the smallest salmon nigiris I've EVER seen.  Like, the salmon was 1/2 an inch long.... but it did taste good.  Their appetizers were a bit disappointing.  We tried the garlic edamame, and it was weird. We tried the crab puffs and they were standard iffy chinese restaurant style.  i'll probably go back, just cause I live in the 'Tuke... but... Yeah, I was disappointed.

The food was pretty damn good.  The drinks, also damn good.  I tried their special seafood enchiladas which were stuffed with goat cheese, shrimp, crab and scallops, all topped with a creamy tomatillo sauce.  YUM. The creamed corn and chipotle mashed potatoes, also YUM.  We sat on the patio and watched a dance class happen next door.  My one and only complaint.... the table.  The actual table itself.  It was wooden, and very pokey.  Like, we all thought we were going to get splinters.  Not nice.

Great place for Mojitos. The bartender Sean is the best Mojito maker this side of ... Jamaica?  The food is truly terrible. Ambience is a bit obnoxious  But the staff and bar full of regulars is a Hoot!  Loves it!  (btw, if you're hungry, go to the sushi place in the same strip mall, its awesome!)

I'm updating my review  The last three times I ate at this place, it was pretty poor.  The sashimi was chewy, fishy, and just all around gross.  I got teriyaki chicken and the chicken appeared to have been microwaved...  I'm disappointed since this place is soooo close to my house.  Alas, I must find another place.    Booo!

I no like.  I thought the atmosphere was awful.  Too bright and hospital like for my tastes.  I thought the staff was incredibly snotty, inept and downright rude.  I thought the wine selection left a lot to be desired.  It was cheap because it was happy hour.    We got the cheese plate only to discover that the cheeses were from Trader Joes cheese section, and were rather... commercial and blah It also came with sliced pepperoni.  Pepperoni?  Really?  I just didn't like it. Which is truly a shame, because I was hoping it could become my new wine happy hour staple.   But alas, I'll keep searching....

I thought this place was awesome!!  Ok, so I went in there with low expectations.  Having heard from friends it was just ok, then reading the reviews here on yelp....  I was so pleasantly suprised!  Yay!  Lets see For an appetizer we got the lobster queso spinach dip.  It was heavenly.  Mmmmm, melty cheese and lobster... mmm......  I got the Prime Rib with au gratin potatoes and port mushrooms. The potatoes were gooey and spicy! The mushrooms were soooooooooooooooo good, andI could definitely taste the port  For dessert I had the creme brulee cheesecake OMG SOOO GOOD!  So yeah, I was very excited that the food turned out to be so good.  I'd love to go back.

Ok I've only ever had the gelato here, although they do have a small dessert case filled with cupcakes and cake slices  However, their gelato is so good, why get anything else?  A small with two scoops is $3 Not too shabby!  My favorite flavor is strawberry with chocolate gelato.  It's like eating chocolate covered strawberries.... yum!!!

I lived in France for a few years, and I'm a bit of a cheese snob.  I found the cheese here to be much, much better than Melting Pot.  I do have to agree with the other reviewer in that it really was quite expensive, and each time I've visited the place was nearly empty.....

The food was awesome Had a crepe and some daily pate and cheeses  However, I didn't enjoy the ambiance.  Just like the other reviewers, I found it to be too old people-ish, especially when its right next door to the trendy, loud RA crowd.

I have good luck at this place. Love their dresses, and how everything is always an additional % off.  Case in point, today I got a FCUK dress for $30! YES!!! (and not one of their plain/basic ones, a v fancy one)  Now, it is a clearance center, so like any other bargain place, it is hit or miss.  Have left here empty handed a few times...

I needed a new dermatologist My last one was bonkers.  I found English dermatology online from doing a search on my United healthcare website.  I called, they tried to give me an appointment with a PA I refused, and asked for an appointment with a MD (no offense PA's, just my personal preference)  I ended up getting an appointment with Dr. Yue   I loved her! And, what advice and medicine she gave me.... worked!!! Like within a day I noticed a great improvement in my skin.  I also enjoy that I didn't have to wait long, was given many free samples, and that they had a nice reef aquarium in the waiting room.  Great practice I say!

I love Aloosions  It's a unique Scottsdale spa.  I like the homey feel of the place.  Aloosions is very comfortable and has an atmosphere which is much more relaxed than most other big spas I've visited.  I've had all kinds of treatments done at Aloosions, and I especially like the weekly specials that are sometimes emailed to me.  Every once in awhile I'll get an email stating "50% off all facials only tomorrow!!", and then I make a mad rush to the phone and try and get in :)

The service was good.  The atmosphere was a bit loud, but there was a polka band playing not too far away from our table :)  The food was great!  The sausage sampler was excellent The Jaegar schnitzel was DELICIOUS The spaetzal was amazing, plentiful, and cooked al dente (just the way I like it!)  The gulash was also very good (however we all thought that the meat was a bit tough for a gulash and could have been tender-er)  Beer selection was nice  Desserts were decidedly not German, well, some of them were.  We ordered the creme brulee, and the Milka chocolate lava cake.  The cake was AWESOME  The creme brulee... eh... not so much.  The top wasn't even crisp.  I guess thats what we get for ordereing a French dessert at a German restaurant :)  All in all, I'd go back!

I'm used to the Dave and Busters in Cleveland Ohio which is the size of a small city  This Dave and Busters is much smaller than the Cleveland one, and it didn't have a lot of my favorite games  :(  Next time I'll just stick in my hood and go to Gameworks  Dave and Busters - Gameworks - Jillians = all the same!  THEY'RE THE SAME!  Just go to the one closest to your house.  Boo.

I was amused by this place  I thought the food was great too.  Not sure if I'd go back to eat though.  Just seems like more of a drinking/lounge place to me.  I had the Strawberry Smash martini and it was very good Also had the Watermelon Mojito and it was also very good.  Good times.

Loved it. I'd like to see it again and again and again and again.  I didn't want it to end.  We were probably the furthest seats possible, and I wasn't too disappointed.  We were able to see the stage in its entirety, which is something the front rows probably didn't get to experience.  Loved it. Next time I will probably try and get an aisle closer seat though...  It's totally worth the money.

This was my first vietnamese experience, and WOW!  I am extremely allergic to peanuts, and was worried about my allergy impeding on my culinary excursion.  However, the staff at Pho Sapa was more than accomodating, and once I showed that I knew nothing of Vietnamese cuisine, they walked me through the menu and gave me many suggestions.  For my boyfriend and I we ordered -  Pho Special - Lemongrass Chili Chicken - Spring Rolls  It was all sooooooooo good.  We requested spicy level 4 (out of 5), and I actually probably could have handled the 5.  We also had the Vietnamese iced coffee, and it was so good it puts Starbucks to shame.  We ordered all the food to go, and the staff even helped carry the food out to our car with us!  Excellent experience, food, and service, we will be returning A LOT :)

Was drawn here because of their prix fixe menus. (I love prix fixe menus)  I ended up going for the $20 menu My main man got the $30 menu  I had 1.  Tomato mozz salad thing 2.  Fettucine with mushrooms 3.  Carmelized peach meringue thingy  OMG! The food was to die for!!!  My main man's mussels and ravioli were also ravely reviewed.  The service was amazing, atmosphere was great, I absolutely loved this place.

Eh.  We had a gift certificate to this place off of our player's cards.  It was good, but drastically overpriced.  I would have been just as happy going to Maggianos or something like that.  I had the penne with vodka sauce, and it was not memorable.  It was good, don't get me wrong.  Just not $20something dollars good!!!!!  Meh, I wouldn't return when there are so many other great places to eat at in Vegas.

I ate here because I was starving and it was 1am. There were no other easy places to eat....  So I had their 10.95 steak and shrimp special... heh... I even laughed when I ordered it.  Wow, was it terrible.  But it's my own fault :) HA! Menu was pretty boring, service was bad, obviously the 10$ steak was poor.. ha.  Yeah, next time I'll just walk half a block to Dennys instead.

This place has a big sign outside that says  "Under New Management"  I'm not sure how new the management is, or if the old management sucked... whatever.  Don't really care.  I totally dig this place.  $3.99/lb of live Fiji rock, AWESOME! $7.99/lb of live Tonga rock, HUZZAH! (I got 20lbs of live rock, and when I brought it home and set it up, all these little starfish and shrimp climbed out of the rock! )  I'm new to the marine aquarium world and I like that the guys here totally love saltwater tanks, talking about them, giving advice, etc etc.  They've been very helpful, and have super cool fishies to stare at too! I like a lot.

OMG I freakin' love this place!  How have I not been here before??!?!?!  I want to eat here everyday.  I had the spicy teriyaki chicken with brown rice, and I thought it was AMAZING  My bf had the pulled pork and I tried it and thought it was better than most of the pulled pork we had in Hawaii (though they don't carry poi... boo)  So yeah.  I dug this place.  I'm excited to try the other items on the menu, although since the teriyaki was soooo good it'll be hard not to get it!  AGHH! I LOVE!

Actually, I took Cake Cafe cupcakes one week to a party, then a few weeks later I took Sprinkles cupcakes to a party with the same group of people and everyone was disappointed in Sprinkles and wanted Cake Cafe cupcakes back!  I personally like the bluberry and raspberry chocolate cupcakes the best.  Deeeelish.  (PS, I don't give a crap if they use mixes or whatever.  The end product is all that matters to me)

I really really dig this place. I've only ever been for the Sunday brunch, on two occasions to be exact.  Both times I also got a bit drunk, because of the bottomless mimosas and bellinis.....  Both times I got the eggs benedict, and they were PERFECT Loved the taste of the champagne hollandaise sauce.  So yeah, free booze, great food, seasonal menus, swank decor and super nice service = 5 stars!

So if you and your family/friends don't enjoy the spicy, look elsewhere.  The fundido sauce is to die for.  I love their roasted hatch chiles. Love it.

Three years later and I'm still in love. Is it the best sushi?  No. But for the price, flippin' awesome.   I can eat me some salmon nigiri, and at this place, it's completely acceptable quality with an unbeatable price.  We typically call for takeout, like, 2 times per week. If this place ever closes, I don't know what I'd do.

Came here for the first time, with a large group for a birthday party. Uhhhhhh...... DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We ordered a great variety of appetizers including: lamb stuffed mushrooms chicken shwarma tuna tartare flatbread of the day calamari and seafood wontons  Everything I tried, I really liked.    This night, they had two entree specials, including a full maine lobster dinner, and baby back ribs... of a lamb!  I opted for the $27 lobster dinner special, and got my maine lobster grilled- and it came with a cup of clam chowder and fries.  I also ordered a side of the proscuitto mac and cheese.  The lobster was delicious, the sides were delicious, and the mac and cheese was AMAZINGGGGGGGGGG. I was really impressed with the price of this entree- because it was pretty great!  For dessert we ordered bread pudding, chocolate pot au creme, chocolate blackberry cake, and peach cobbler.   The desserts were good, but the appetizers and entrees were so great in my mind, they overshadowed the desserts.  All in all, it was a really fantastic meal, and I was shocked at how inexpensive this whole experience was.  Great value for the money!  The server was attentive, Eddie stopped by and chatted with us for awhile.   I'll be back :)

I split the toasted marshmellow shake (a vanilla shake filled with teeny pieces of toasted marshmellows!), a kobe beef burer and sweet potato fries for dinner.  MY GOD Everything was so great, the portions were nicely sized, and man o man did everything taste good.  I love.

I chose to go here because of Allison's review. Granted, her review was over 2 years ago.....  But this emergency room was EMPTY!!!  I showed up and was immediatly seen.  Everyone was super nice and quick.  I was literally in and out within one hour.  And I wasn't going in for a simple procedure either....  -1 star becuase after treatment they moved me back into the waiting room to see how I'd do.  Hmmmm.... why not leave me in a bed all comfortable in back?  You're not that busy!    But whatever.  If ever in need of an ER in the Vegas area, this is where I'll return.

I would give it zero stars if I could.  Sigh.  My old friend was in town, and we hadn't seen each other in years.  We planned on getting together, having facials and massages, then laying around the pool all afternoon before a fancy dinner.  I had a gift certificate from spafinder and thought that the spa at the Valley Ho seemed like a great choice!  We arrived 15 minutes early, were checked in, showed our robes, given lockers, and told to wait in the waiting room for our technicians to fetch us.  We waited. And waited. And waited.  After approx 40 minutes (which went by fast as we're old friends and had a lot of catching up to do), I poked my head towards reception and was told "We forgot you were here, we're sorting it out"  Another 20 minutes pass, and employees start trying to devise plans to accomodate both of us and both of our appointments.    The hour long wait cost us our much anticipated pool time, they put my friend in a hotel room with a mobile table for her massage, and my afternoon of relaxation turned to extreme anxiety and disappointment.  They did not apologize, simply took our money and turned their noses up at us.    The worst of it is, I used my birthday GC on this piece of crap spa :( Such a waste.

LOVED IT!  Ok I love French food. I love cajun food. Thus, I love this place.  I came here for a Saturday brunch Had the croque monsieur.  So good!  Unlike the croque monsieur's typically found in France, this one was served on a very thick French brioche type bread, and was filled with chipped ham and gruyere cheese, then topped with a bechamel sauce.  OMG.  Very rich, very unhealthy, very tasty.  To wash it down, I had some sort of champagne and elder cocktail.  Also delicious. I also thought it was very reasonably priced.  I can't wait to come back and try more things at this place.

5 stars for the taste of the food.  2 stars for service.  YIKES.  I'm allergic to peanuts.  I told the lady server this from the get-go, and she confidently stated she'd let the kitchen know and assured that no peanuts would reach the table.  Of the 8 dishes we ordered, 7 were brought to the table garnished with peanuts.  7!  Each time, the server would apologize and blame it on the kitchen.    I would be inclined to believe her, if it weren't for the crap service she provided otherwise.   We constantly had empty drinks, and at one point, during a particularly spicy dish, we ended up having to flag her down out of desperation.  The food did taste great though.  Too bad I'll never come back because of the service/peanut concerns.

Went to the Mission today for a nice Saturday brunch  Some old people relatives of mine were in town, so we made reservations and all together we were 10 people.  The server was super sweet, food came out quick, drinks were refilled, the manager stopped by multiple times to make sure we were taken care of.  And the food.... Oh sweet sweet brunch food with a Latin twist.  We got a couple orders of the tableside guacamole ($12 for a teeny bowl!  Yikes!).  The guacamole was absolutely delicious, and they can adjust the spiciness and ingredients to your liking.  For my main meal, I got the corn pancakes topped with crab and some creme chile sauce.  YUM YUM YUM.  My main squeeze got steak tacos, and holy crap were they good!  I can't wait to go back to this place.  I really, really, really liked it.

My man, Dan H, gave this place three stars He sucks sometimes, and generally doesn't like Latin type food  BOO DAN BOO!!!

Ok, My favorite slot machine is called "Stampede"  AND THEY HAVE LIKE 5 OF THEM!!!!!  HOORAY!  HOORAY!  Indian casinos DO NOT usually have these, so I save all my pennies for my once a year trip to Vegas which includes eating, trying to find every Stampede game in town, and more eating  And now theres a casino 2 miles from my house with STAMPEDE!  Sigh.  I'll need a 12 step pretty soon.  I was suprised how small this place was.  I thought that the different entrance themes were cute.  I thought it was very clean.  Nice big parking lot.  This casino would have recieved 3 stars, but I give 2 extra stars for my beloved 2cent Stampede slot machines :)

Delicious bar food! I very much enjoy the menu options.  I do find that the service is a bit lacking, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I get that it's more of a free form type of place... (e.g. no host, no real structure for the tables, etc).... but that just stresses me out.  Bleh.

Ok, so this lady is seriously talented. Seriously. Like artist talented.    These aren't your typical, run of the mill face paintings. I'll attach a few pics of the work she did on my hand and my boyfriend's face (he wanted a painting to look like he fell into a cactus)  I like.

Meh. For the prices charged, the food doesn't live up. I found the food to be good/decent, but certainly not for the $25-$35 per plate charged.  My chicken wrapped in proscuitto and stuffed with cheese was good.  Properly cooked.  A bit creative.  But $25 worth? Hellllllllllllll no. $12 would be more like it.  The ambiance of this place is super weird too.  Great service though!

AWESOME SERVICE!  If it weren't for the awesome service, I woulda given this place 4 stars. But man o man, the servers were always accessible without being overbearing.  Loved it.  I also loved the salad bar, and the side dishes.  The meat was awesome too, but I'm just not into meat like that.  Next time I return, I'm salad barring it all the way.

Holyyyyyyyyyy cow. This place knocked my socks off.  Started with the brie baked in bread with a balsamic reduction glaze....  OMG  Went onto the lobster porcini soup..... I would rather drink this than water everyday.  For an entree I had the butter poached lobster and ricotta gnocchi entree.  SO GOOD!  The table bread and butter.... (it's rosemary cranberry herb butter).... mmmmmmmm  The chocolate decadence dessert, great.  Service, fantastic. Decor, awesome.  I love this place, and would highly recommend it.   (btw, I went here with a $50 restaurant.com gc, worked beautifully)  YAY Avalon!

I left my furbabies here while I went to Europe  So it was a long time, like 20 something days.  Preppy Pet is super cheap pricewise compared to the other places!  In addition, each time I called I would get the same lady, who genuinely knew my pups and would tell me what they had been up to.  I really liked this place, and wouldn't hesitate leaving my furbabies with them again.

I'm a natural red head The palest of the pale  I've tried "Mystic tan" in the past and ended up looking like an oompa loompa  I was going on vacation to Puerto Rico and decided to try fake tanning again, so I didn't look like an albino.  Found Michele here on yelp, and I'm glad I did  Michele came out to my house, spray painted me and my man in a blue tent she set up in the backyard.  My man wore briefs, I wore a thong and went topless  Michele was able to use the "light" tan coloring on my skin, so I didn't look like an oompa loompa!  Hooray!  I looked fabulous for Puerto Rico.    The tan faded after about 3-4 days (though I was in and out of saltwater, covered in spf and mosquito spray constantly)  $50 well spent in my mind.  Huzzah!

So, according to Martin's brochure, he does everything and anything having to do with your yard.    Cleanups, sprinklers, monthly services, landscape design, etc etc  I called Martin after finding his brochure on my door knob.  That's how I choose my landscaper.  My yard was like a jungle.  Overgrown grass, weeds, trees, blah! (I've been out of the country a lot the past few months)  Martin and a team of workers came over to my place, and for $100 bucks they took care of EVERYTHING.  And I mean, EVERYTHING!  They even netted my pool clean!  And they emptied a small trash can I forgot about!    So after being thoroughly satisfied with the work, I hired Martin to come out on a bi-monthly basis for $70 per month.    A steal, all things considered, because my yard is big and a painnnnn  Hooray!

I'm totally a fan!  After being provided with sampler cups, me and my mom proceeded to taste every flavor.  I was thoroughly impressed by the original tart, the chocolate, the strawberry, and the cookie monster.  I opted to be "healthy" and got a small cup of the tart flavor, and put on kiwi and strawberry slices as toppings!  The result, delicious! And it was $3.50 for it.    Nonfat yogurt never tasted better to me.  I'm a fan.

SIGHHHHHHHHHH  I really *really* wanted to like this place. Honestly.  Went here for happy hour (which is 7 days a week btw) All speciality drinks and appetizers were half price.    We ordered some cocktails, a cheese plate, sliders, mac and cheese and crab cakes.  The cocktails and crab cakes were great!  Everything else.... not so much. The cheese tasted like..... generic monterey jack and cheddar cheeses sliced up.  The fruit didn't seem properly washed.  The sliders were completely cold and the meat was dry.  So yeah, I probably won't come back unless I'm feeling daring, or they get a new chef. The mac and cheese was the most bland mac and cheese EVER!  I would have rather had Kraft mac and cheese than this.

Visited this place for the first time today  $70 for a hot stone massage $55 for a swedish massage (both 50 minutes)  I opted for the hot stone, by main man got the swedish massage.  Since we're a bonafide couple, they put us in the couples suite!  It was super fun.  We were a couple feet apart from each other.  I was supposed to get a pedicure right afterwards, but the nail tech was running late and I couldn't wait. They were very apologetic, and gave me a gift card as an apology!  AWESOME  I love places that have great customer service.  They also have a special where for $165 you get 1 hour massage 1 hour facial pedicure/manicure and lunch  AWESOME prices  The place looks brand new, is in a fancy space, and is very relaxing.  I totally dig it.

Meh. I like the outdoor patio. I like the mojitos, and the mojito style lemonade.  Service was AWFUL.  We were basically ignored for most of the time. I thought the food was meh. Meh.  The filet medallions with shrimp and bernaisse wasn't bad... but..... meh.  The spicy sirloin sandwich with fries... it definitely wasn't spicy, and it too.... eh..... meh.  I'll come back for brunch, to give it another shot.  I *really* want to like this place.

I've been dreaming of their nachos for two days now. TWO WHOLE DAYS.  Their nachos have this magical red pepper cheese sauce on them.  I could drink it, but I won't, because its much better on the chips n stuff.  Their wings are also the best.  Tavern style it.  Trust me. They like fry and grill them or something?  Whatever they do, they're the best.  Love it.

The only thing I was impressed with was the duck.  I thought the pizza was .....   .......   *yawn* Meh.  I doubt I'll ever be back. But if I do go back, I'll get the duck club instead of pizza.

WOW! The service here was outstanding! Everyone in the entire place seemed to smile, work as a team, and generally do everything and anything possible to make sure me and my family had a great time.  And the food was great too!  -1 star for a the music/interior.  It was almost like rat pack cool type of vibe, but then there was a kinda creepy lady on a piano playing old people music.  I didn't mind it, but my family remarked multiple times they thought it was creepy.  *Shrug*

Because of Christine's glowing review, I decided to try Angel Eyes.  MY HOUSE IS SO CLEAN!! :)  And let me tell you, it was dirty.  For realz. but now....  now..... now it's so clean!!  I'm so happy.   I wonder how quickly me, my man, and my two furry babies will be able to soil this clean house.  I thought that the husband and wife team that is Angel Eyes were friendly, reasonably priced, and great cleaner/organizers!  I will definitely be calling them again in the near future.

I was so excited to eat here. So excited!  Now I'm disappointed.   Crushed even.  Came here for Valentine's Day. It was my suggestion.  I am to blame.  They had a prix fixe menu of  Lobster bisque Shrimp cocktail (which they ran out of, so they substituted the Coquilles St Jaques instead) Beef Wellington with chateaubriand sauce Chocolate Souffle  Sounds delicious no?  NO!  Gahhhhh  The lobster bisque was tasteless.  It tasted like pink tinted creme.  And I love lobster bisque.  Anywhere that sells it, I get it, and this bisque was terrible.  The Coquilles St Jacques... inedible.  I felt like I was eating mashed ritz crackers swimming in a pool of butter with lots of apples.  Gross.  The beef wellington... well... this was the best thing we had all evening.  The beef was terribly tough though, and tasted a it off.  The pastry and spread around the beef was delicious though.  The chateaubriand was not rich, and was yet again... tasteless.  The chocolate souffle was the worst.  I didn't even get a hint of chocolate.  It was like.... really soggy french toast in a cup without any syrup.  Soggy bread.  Gross.  We informed our server how disappointed we were by the souffle, so he was kind enough to bring us chocolate creme brulees instead.  While these brulees were better..... sigh.  We really didn't like it. I would have rather ate at soooooooooo many other places. I was trying to avoid a chain, and all the cliche Valentine's Day stuff, but this place was so awful, I could cry.  It's Valentine's Day, and this place's food made me want to cry.  I will not ever, ever, ever even consider going back. Barf.

This place reminded me of another couple restaurants.... namingly the BLT restaurants.... ***cough cough ripoff!**** Ahem.  Now that I've got that off my chest... onto my review!  I enjoyed the table bread.  They bring out little mini loafes of loaded baked potato and this other salty onion bread stuff.  The bread was good... damn good.  I ended up ordering the seared big eye tuna steak, with edamame dumplings.  YUM. Seriously, yum.  I loved the tuna, I loved the sauce, I loved the edamame mush shoved into perfectly gyozas..... YUM.  My main squeeze did have bad luck with his kobe burger.  He ordered it medium rare, and it came out well done.  The server was professional and apologetic, and removed the burger from the bill.  My bf sure was sad at the waste of kobe though....   I enjoy the decor, I loved the patio.... I shall return.

This place is super shiney, modern and new.  I love the decor and the feel of this place.  They have super cute stuff for sale in their boutique-y area.  But their mainly a nail salon..... 20 Lounge offers monthly membership ($30 per month), which include one appointment and then 20% off any additional services, and it all rolls over month to month or can be gifted to friends!  -1 star for not having those massage chairs while I get a pedicure.  I truly do enjoy those chairs, and will go to nail places just so I can sit in them.

Blech.  Had the croque madame, and I agree with other people on here.  Not enough sauce!  It was so dry tasting... thought I did like the bread they used.  I am also super lazy, and find the ordering at the counter thing to be confusing/irritating/ridiculous.  I totally wanted to love this place, but I really didn't.  Will doubt I'll be back.

Stopped by here on a Saturday night for dinner with friends.... and ended up staying like 4 hours!  We ordered drinks, hookah, and dinner menu items.  The food was delicious, and the homemade pita bread was outstanding. The hookah was delicious... but the real standout here was the service.  Everytime I thought we may need new coals... BAM, there they were offering us new coals.  If we were close to being out of a drink, BAM, another drink would appear! They even brought over complimentary smoothie tastings, and gave us $10 off coupons for our next visit.  After 9:30pm there was a live band that played inside and people danced on the dance floor, and there was a belly dancer performing on the patio!  Loved loved loved it.

I decided to try Kathy out of sheer laziness.  My previous tailor is in Chandler, and I live in Ahwatukee, and Kathy is in Ahwatukee.  So I gave Kathy a shot. SO GLAD I did!  She fixed up a shirt for my hubby, and shortened two pairs of very expensive jeans for me, cause I'm a bit vertically challenged.  Everything came out perfect!  Couldn't be happier.  Kathy allows me to look great and be lazy!

Be very, very, very careful when coming to this dealership. They fully expect you to buy a car, without test driving it.  Unfortunately, my husband and I were seriously interested in a car that could only be found at this dealership.  Alas, they would not let us test drive it because "they didn't want to put extra mileage on the car".    I've test driven Ferarris, Porsches, Range Rovers, BMWs, etc.... and never had ANY of these dealerships blink an eye when I asked to test drive their vehicles.  Apparently, the cars at this dealership are just that "exclusive".  Save your time and money, and go to another Dodge/Jeep dealership that will treat you sanely, and with respect.

$30 for an hour long massage, $55 for a two hour long massage.  It's definitely not a swanky massage parlor though... so if that's what you're looking for head over to Cloud Nine in Tempe  You leave your clothes on, get ushered back and put in a reclining chair separated from other reclining chairs with hospital like curtains.  They get the job done though, I love it~!

RACLETTE!!!!!  OHHHHHHHH sweet sweet raclette, how I love thee.  This place has raclette, and it serves it in the old-school way.  Big wheel o' cheese, stuck on some stakes and melting all over meats, potatoes, and cornichons.  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I tried their savory crepes, I tried the dessert crepes, and I can't wait to come back for some chocolate fondue and more raclette.  And maybe some tartiflette.    Holy crap am I happy I discovered this place.  ***They also have the calories listed next to about a dozen entrees, pretty cool!

When I saw that my 'hood was getting a new yogurt place... I was all like "pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee please please please be good!"  And you know what.  It is FANTASTIC! OMG, the red velvet yogurt flavor... to die for.  I love the open concept of the place, and the water bowl for puppies on the patio!  This place opened two days ago, and I've been two times already.  They have lots of different flavors, ranging from 90-120 calories per four ounce serving.  It's a serve yourself type of place, and has a toppings bar.   There is also a display case that sells Tammie Coe baked goods.  YUM!!!!

I was so jetlagged when I ate here....  But I loved loved loved the food!  I had the pigeon with haggis, and then the scallops with more haggis, and a bunch of beer.  So great!  The food really was artfully done.  On tip though.... we were in our touristy garb, jeans/sweaters... and everyone else around us was rather dressy.  Made me feel like such a scrub.  I'd come back here next time I'm in Edinburgh for sure.

My honey ordered the lamb chops with jalapeno mint jelly, he loved them I ordered the garlic cream sauced pasta with avocados and shrimp  YUM  Paying for chips and salsa does irritate me though.  LAME  I'll definitely be back. So happy we have a place like this in the Tuke!

Holy.crap.  The best, ever.  I LOVE THEIR HOT DOGS!  OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!  I could eat their hot lady dog everyday forever and be happy.  A delicious spicy hot dog, on a naan bread, topped with chipotle cream cheese and all sorts of other delicousness.  SO GOOD!  I should have gotten two.  One to eat, one to go.

Meh MEHHHHHHHHHHH  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. I ended up with the giant seafood pancake thing off of the lunch menu, the Okonomiyaki.  I thought the flavors were ok, but the seafood was pretty chewy and rubbery.  From all the glowing reviews here on yelp, I expected different I guess. Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I probably won't be back.

I really liked it. The music was very dance-technoish- electric on a Friday night. This made me very happy, as I can't stand hip hop or anything like it.  The crowd seemed to be a lot of people like me, so yeah, I liked 'em.  I'd totally go back here, before going to any other club in Old Town actually...

Um. HOLY CRAP WAS MY BUFFALO BURGER GOOD! And for under 475 calories?!  LOVE IT. Will return.  Wish I could return everyday for every meal.  Service was a bit over the top/cheesy.  But whatever. The food was delicious!

For a sports bar, I think this place is great. They have interesting, seasonal beers, and a solid sports bar food menu.  The food suprised me, and I thought it was very tasty and really well done (as far as sports bar food goes).  Am excited to go back and try out other beers/food items.  And I rarely feel that way about a sports bar.

Awesome service, and really great prices.  We just bought our first house, and knew that we needed wires run, and other odds and ends done.  They came over, crawled around our crawl space... hung our chandelier.... and POOF!  Now our house is all electrizied!  A friend referred us to Good Guys, and they really knew their stuff.  Loved them.

I'm going to be honest. I'm ridiculous when it comes to my pets.   Seeing as though I have one 15 year old Pomeranian - I didn't feel like he, or I, could handle the stress of a kennel.  Through yelp I find these guys - and was quite apprehensive about letting strangers not only in my house but to care for my two precious dogs.  After ten long days away - and a daily text to joy to the pets to keep me sane, I came home to find two happy pups.   Additionally - joy to the pets left detailed notes regarding each visit and even brought over more treats as we'd run out! I'd use them again and recommend them to any friend.

Flippin' delicious.  This place is a foodie's dream come true. I had the blackened salmon plate, with salad greenery, pita and tzatski sauce (or however you spell that)  The blackened salmon was heavenly, nice and spicy, and cooked perfectly.....  combine that with all the other elements on the plate.... YUM.  I'll be back, becuase I really did want to try like 10 other items on the menu.

I really liked this place. The drinks (they have lo cal drinks for us ladies counting calories), the foods (some sushi rolls, tacos, etc), and the atmosphere were excellent!  I did hope that the pool would be open at nighttime, so I could see some drunken pool antics, but it closes at 6pm.    Will be back many times I'm sure...

Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhh I felt like it was really uncomfortable in this place. Like there was no real dance floor  From all the hooplah on this place's Facebook page about a strict dress code, I expected the clientele here to be a bit... well... classier?  Better dressed?  I dunno...  It just seemed kinda trashy, very uncomfortable, and I don't think I'd ever go back.  Bleh.

Quirky, cheap, fun place. Super cheap draft beer.  The food is pretty good too, I like the pork tacos....  Only complaint is that their queso is a bit thin and bland....  Now, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't travel specifically to come here, by any means.  But since my office is right next door, it's my favorite go to place!

I flippin' love this place. Tasty tasty food.  I do hate that I have to order at a counter, and I hate that it's so damn loud in the restaurant, and I hate the parking.  But the food makes up for everything else. I love Green!

I'm obsessed with their salads.  I used to be obsessed with their burritos, until once I tried their salad... I was sold.  Their salads are fresh, and the dressing is SOOO good.  I could drink it.

I really liked it! And I can be a bit of a sushi snob.  The rolls are BIG.  One was too much food for me.  So, if you're looking for cheap, delicious, fresh sushi rolls.... give this place a try!

Came here for the lunch buffet It was damnnnnnnnnnn tasty!  I have a nut allergy, and one of the workers took me through the buffet and pointed out all the items that I should avoid, which put my sometimes anxious mind at ease  Plus, if you check-in here on Yelp, you get 10% off!

Great, casual, cheap sushi! I also like that they have plenty of "cooked" sushi options for my mother, who is still terrified of eating raw fish.

I've had the chance to eat here twice! Once was for an event, so we had appetizers being passed... and everything was great.  Came back with friends for a proper dinner.  The three of us decided to order a variety of the "small plates", including the cowboy caviar, the bone marrow, snakebite lollipops, quail and mussels.  We were under the impression that "small plates" would be small... but, we WAY over ordered.  The small plates were large, in our opinion.  I could have had the qual by myself as a filling meal.   But, hey, that makes this place a fantastic value!!    Food was fresh, creative, and everything was absolutely delicious.  My hubby raves about the bone marrow!  Will be back!

My friends and I meandered into this place Saturday night at 11pm... starving.  We're huge huge HUGE fans of soup dumplings, and were pleasantly suprised to find out this place has reverse happy hour on food and drinks, and the soup dumplings were discounted! YES!@!!!!  We ended up with 7 orders of soup dumplings, a sugar can pork, and two duck confits.  Everything was AMAZING. So happy/lucky to have a place like this in Phx  :)

Meh. We went here for happy hour.   The happy hour prices aren't that great in my opinion. In fact, I found the happy hour prices to be pretty comparable to other bar's normal prices for beers, snacks, etc.  We ordered a few beers.  They were good.  Beer = good.  We ordered chicken skewers and pretzels as snacks.  I thought the pretzels were sub par (though I do always compare pretzels to the mall pretzels... mmm... butter = good) Chicken skewers were a bit on the rubbery side.  Don't think I'll be coming back.

I enjoy this hotel immensely. I like the food, I like the music, I like the smallish casino floor, I just like it.  A lot.  The rooms are stylish, and a bit worn in the older towers.  But who cares.... this is a party hotel!  Party!!!! This is not for families.  This is for those of us who like to stay up until 9am every night while in Vegas.  I was in a wheelchair due to a recent ankle shattering, and everyone at this hotel was very accomodating and nice to me.

Great! Their happy hour prices are very reasonable, and the $3 salmon nigiri was delicious! Plus- they had a lot of "cooked" sushi options for my mother who is scared of raw fish.  Silly mom.

Great place! I loved the atmosphere- and the food was also fantastic.  Came here for happy hour, and was pleased by the food offerings, and their prices. I did wish that they had more specialty drinks on happy hour specials (as they only had wine, well and beer specials).

Um..... Ended up here on a Saturday night. The club was super dead... yet they had a line out the door. So, there I was, standing in the middle of the place... and the only other people who passed the door test were 50+ and NOT attractive.   WTF?!!? Stayed for a $15 drink and then bolted.  I can understand line building to a certain extent, but this was off the charts oldpeopleville.  Won't be back.

Super solid. And... AND, I'm super psyched to have this place in my hood!  Came here for a Friday lunch, and all of the food was A++ Very much enjoyed the chopped wasabi as well!  One thing I think they could improve upon is their lunch specials.  They have the setup where you pick 2, or 3 or 4 items from a list... which I've encountered numerous times at sushi places.  But their list is ALL rolls.  I wish I could get a mix of sashimi/sushi/roll, or whatever. Just... I can't see myself consuming 4 different rolls for lunch...

I've been a client of Becca's (the owner) for almost six years now- and have been regularly having appointments here since it opened.  I love Becca and her services, love the location, and love the complimentary glass of champagne!

Well, I was hoping for better.  I was pretty excited about this place opening up in my 'hood, and I met some friends here for happy hour.  The service started out on a bad note.  When we entered, there were four or five employees congregated around the front entrance, and all greeted us with a friendly hello.  However, once we sat down, our table wasn't approached for approx 5 minutes.  But, this place just opened, and I know new restaurants have kinks to work out, so I'll let that slide.  Onto the happy hour menu.  Happy hour only has discounted drinks, which disappointed all of us as we do enjoy discounted apps, etc.  We ordered a few drinks, two appetizers and one salad entree.   For appetizers we ordered the Tuscan plate and the green chili cheese dip.  The Tuscan plate was alright, though we would have preferred a mix of different meats and different cheeses maybe (it comes with a goat cheese, salami, roasted red peppers, olives and crostini) The green chili cheese dip comes with crostini and tortilla chips.  The cheese dip tasted very similar to velveeta cheese dip... which, luckily, I love.  Well, we all love.  But it's not exactly what I expect to be served at a restaurant I guess.    Camille H ordered the Mexican salad, and it was good- but overly dressed.    Now, the atmosphere.  Like many other places in this part of Ahwatukee, this place seems to be geared towards older clientele.  We all ended up commenting on the music situation, as it seemed..... well.... not very hip I guess?   I assume that the kinks with the service and food will be worked out with time.  However, I won't be returning unless the happy hour is revamped and the music selection is changed!

I was pleasantly surprised, and I'm very hopeful for this place!  After seeing a handful of restaurants come and go in this location, I truly hope this one sticks around!    My friends and I stopped by for happy hour, even though this place is still under it's "soft opening".  We had beer and wine, and then ordered some bruschetta, a meat and cheese plate, hummus and an ahi tuna panini. All of the food was very tasty, and the drinks were equally delicious.

I command you to order a bundt cake here for your next party.  I got one for a birthday.  I was hesitant.  I didn't know what a bundt cake was really.... I just saw pics and thought they looked super neat!  OMG SOOOO GOOOOOOD!!!!!  I'd like to try one in each flavor.  Honestly.  So good.  They all have cream cheese frosting.  Which is my favorite.  I chose red velvet cake with chocolate chips.  It was soooooooooooo moist and delicious.  I love this place.  I command you to try it so you can agree with me.
