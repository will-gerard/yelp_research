This place is awesome! I usually get the VIP on the second floor. Service is always great people are always friendly and there is always something happening there! From foam parties to all dressed in white events! I would definitely recommend checking it out if you want to have an amazing time down town PHX

This hotel is horrible!! The customer service has to be as old as the hotel because they have no understanding of what is like to treat a customer correctly! The front desk has attitude, the valet are airheads and the overall atmosphere just sucks! I regret ever staying here and would like to advice anyone on thinking about staying here to STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!! Rooms are small bathtubs have roaches, paint is chipping off the walls.... Ugh just a bad experience! I paid 178 for one night and regret it! I've stayed at motel 6 that are way better than this!

These guys are freaking awesome!!!!! I went there to install a new system on my Audi TT right for the beginning Joe was extremely helpful he walked me over all of my options and was treating the whole system picking process las if he was installing it in his own car! All of the guys that work here are extremely friendly and I can tell they really care about what they do! The whole time I was there they made me feel like family and kept me aware of what was going on during the entire process! Joe really worked with me to get the best price possible for my system and as I mentioned before I could tell that all of them really care! I bought a new deck, 12"inch sub w amp and a radar detector for my Audi TT. I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a great system but best of all for excellent customer service! What really did it for me was the fact that I was able to bring my Pitt-Weenie into the shop and everyone that was working was extremely friendly with my furry friend! Like I said! If you need a system or any other kind of audio needs GO HERE!!!!!!

I wish I could give negative stars. Food was horrible.. Ordered the ribeye steak 14oz @ 24$ with unlimited shrimp for 8.99. The ribeye tasted as if it was obtained from a cow that was over a hundred years old... I could have gotten a better cut from Albertsons for half the price, cooked it myself, and still would have tasted more tender.. The shrimp were so small I thought I was on an episode of "punked". And the breaded shrimp actually tasted very closely to the jalape√±o poppers from Jack in the box... Anyways very disappointed... Will not be going back... Save your money and go to a near by restaurant that will leave you happy.

Dan or no Dan this place is still amazing!! I actually found the service to be on point! They are actually giving more lemons with your meal than before (there's no one controlling the amount of lemons they give out anymore). Food is still awesome! Now they have churros. I actually wish they were open now because I'm jonesing for some lengua tacos uhmmm... Anyways make sure you check this place out!
