Came here on a Thursday morning with the boyfriend to eat and was greeted by a girl who looked like she just got to work after a night out At the club. I couldn't decide what to eat from their huge menu of 7items. The night club waitress informed us that the eggs benidict was the special today. So we ordered one each. Low and behold the plate was 11dollars each. I wouldn't have minded paying that if the food was good but it wasn't. Small portions and incredibly salty. Just terrible! I couldn't even eat my food. I wouldn't even go back if someone paid me. Maybe the people there should pay more attention to the food instead of trying so had to be hipsters.

Great selection of beer. Kinda small and hard to maneuver through the crowd but great people and helpful friendly bartenders. Oh yeah and good music.

First of all everyone that gave a bad review were probably just fat asses. My boyfriend and I ordered a pizza,12 wings and cokes. For 17 bucks! You can't beat that! Food was super yummy! I ordered the spicy ranch wings and the garlic parmesan wings. Omfg! Bomb!!! Thin crust pizza with spinach and chicken on one side and bacon feta on the other. We were both stuffed plus we got free canoli's Perfect! There is certainly enough room to sit and eat. The guys there are amazing, I love this place. Its the only place I go when I crave pizza.

I had a bikini wax done a few years ago and I thought it was the worst thing ever! I decided that I should give it a go once more before I say fuck it and just continue to shave. I found this place through Yelp actually and saw that they had a great deal for newcomers so it was perfect! My waxed Alexus is fucking awesome! I can't lie, the first time was exactly how you would imagine getting all the hairs ripped out of your vag. Alexus said "just come in for one more and I swear it's not as bad the second time" I thought she was lying but it's really not that bad at all!
