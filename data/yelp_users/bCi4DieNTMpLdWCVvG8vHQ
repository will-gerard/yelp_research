Great environment, friendly service, and good prices. I got the The Cheerful Breakfast which is 1 egg, hash browns, 1 pancake, and bacon, sausage link, ham. I'm not a big fan of ham so I go it with Bacon, a side of Sausage, and an extra egg with cheese.   Everything was amazing. The Pancake was one of the best I've ever had, only downfall for me was the butter. It had walnuts mixed in which is creative but I'm not a big fan of nuts. But the butter was very flavorful and after I scraped off the but I was good to go.   This was my first time here and the menu had a lot of great options. But my first time places I try to stick with something traditional, if they mess that up I won't be back for the complex or special. I recommend it to everyone ASAP!   I will be coming back soon to try the lunch menu.

Some of the best cheesesteaks in AZ hands down! I've been to a couple places and they are good but these are on a night level. Plus their customer service in always on point. Go try them out ASAP. You won't be disappointed.

This is definitely my favorite barbecue spot in Arizona. They are consistent with their food and the customer service is always on point. I like my Brisket with a little fat on it and their cutting is perfect. My girlfriend likes hers with fat all the way through and I must say it's pretty good also. Their St. Louis Ribs are tender and flavorful before the sauce is even thought about, and the Hot Links while smaller than I'm use to pack a nice punch of spice and flavor. I also like that the Mac & Cheese is cheesy, already seasoned, and not runny like its out of a cheap box. The Green Beans are also full of flavor with just the right amount of meat mixed in. I can't wait to go back and eat.   Now I recommend calling ahead if your going after work or close to closing time. They once ran out of every meat except pulled pork, but that's when I knew I was going to be back. If they run out of meat it must be good!   #FoodJones on IG

Always great service when I come here. Great small talk too. Kyle was really helpful today. I suggest you get the Grilled Chicken & Cheddar and an Oreo Shake.

You have to come check it it for yourself to take in all the awesomeness of this place and the people. I love the Breakfast options. My favorite is the Morning Glory or Fly Me To The Moon. And the Orange Affair Fresh Juice Blend is always on point.  If you want Lunch they have some of the "Best Grilled Sandwiches in Arizona" as the azcentral.com article stated. I like The Earl or The B.L. Cheese and the Cinnamon Rolls will have you not wanting to share it with anyone. LOL.   Great location and very nice and comfortable set up for dining in.   I recommend you stop by today and give them a try for Breakfast or Lunch, and tell Marcus how much you love his Cardinals.

This is my favorite LoLo's location in Arizona but today was a disappointment. The food and drinks were good but the service was rough. Our waitress was nice and on top of everything but the kitchen was off today. We got there around 11am and had a short 20 minute wait. We got seated and ordered our drinks and food then we waited... and waited... and waited. Our food finally came around 12:30pm and it wasn't nearly as busy as it normally is when we go. We talked to the manager and he apologized for the extra long wait during a slow time and offered us a couple free desserts. On the way out we heard some banging and screaming in the kitchen area so maybe there was a real issue going on today. This is still my favorite location and I will be back but it probably won't be for a while.

Great food and very friendly staff. I like the Breakfast All Meat Scramble and for Lunch the Cafe 51 Classic is always a winner. A lot of drink selections and they have the Starbucks drinks also. Reasonable prices as well.

Don't go to this Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles location. We tried to for our first time and decided to cancel our order and go somewhere else.   They told us it would be $2 per shrimp for extra shrimp in our Shrimp & Grits.   What?!?!?!?!  We've been going to Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles for 5 years in Scottsdale and on Central and wanted to try the newest location in Gilbert. But we will NEVER get a chance to because of an obvious error and a rude delivery of information.   SMH. Y'all know I try to support all the Black Businesses I can and I just love good food but damn if some people don't make it hard.
