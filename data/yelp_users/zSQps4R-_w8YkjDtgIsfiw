Finally, I know all there's to know about cacti, bee's, butterfly, thyme, rosemary and chives.  The Botanical Garden, a great place to take a stroll on a beautiful spring day, when the garden is at it's blossoming peak.  But as other's have said, go now before it gets too hot!   I really enjoyed my time.  Of course, if you go hoping to see a lot of fresh green's, beautiful plants, and flowers, be ready for disappointment.  But for what it is, a desert garden, it certainly delivers.    $10.00 for admission $3.00 for butterfly exhibit No dogs No biking

So I finally made it to the Mormon Trail (off 24th and Baseline).    As others have said, there is little traffic here compared to Camelback mountain and I understand why.  There are more trails to choose from, and it's not nearly the challenge Camelback is for instance.  But it's a nice alternative if you want to beat the crowd.   It was moderately difficult at some points, but I'm not sure if it was the trail itself that was moderately difficult or the fact that the sun was beating down my neck with no shade to escape and absolutely no breeze whatsoever.  The attack of flies probably didn't help either!  I don't think you are going to catch a lot of wind any time you're on the outskirts of the mountain looking toward the city so my only sensible suggestion would be to go early early early!   It's dog friendly if you bring enough water.  The view of the city is pretty spectacular and it's very deserty.  Look out for Gilo Monsters, they like to watch you themselves.  :)   I like camelback better but this was 'nice'.

I love it..  I only did take out and not sure I would eat in the restaurant.  It kind of feels like you're intruding into somebody else's home when you are in the restaurant, but that aside, I really only care for take outs in this case because I'm the only one in my household who cares for indian anyway.    The food is great.  I just moved to Tempe from Ahwatukee, where I had my Indian Star to comfort me.. and this has turned out to be the perfect replacement.

I was born and raised in Germany.  I came here last night to entertain my boyfriend and his family.  We showed up at about 6:45 pm and I don't believe we were served before 7:45 pm.  The restaurant was packed as was the bar (which surprised me for being in that part of Mesa), so we seated ourselves in the bar, where we each had a drink.  $21 bucks, not bad for four.  I had my "dreckigen" (the 'dirty'), or "coke-beer" for those who don't know, and it was refreshing.  They serve you in large glasses too but the beer is so smooth, it really goes down easy.  When we were seated and looked at the menu, none of us could decide on one thing.  It all looked great and of course, by now we were just starving.  We each made an order, I got the "Schweinebraten" (Pork with dumplings and sauerkraut).   We were then served bread and asked to help ourselves at the full salad bar.  The salad bar had lots to offer, and certainly helped to hold us over for dinner.  I was a little embarassed how long it finally took to get our food.  It's pretty custom to have to wait for your meals in Germany.  When you order, you must expect a wait of at least 30 minutes but I wasn't accustomed to that anymore (call me americanized!).  But fortunately everyone was fine (thanks to the great bread and salad bar) and we weren't in a rush.  Once dinner finally came (and the restaurant started to clear out slowly), everyone seemed happy with their dish.  I really should have ordered a Schnitzel, the pork was too 'smokey' for me, and the dumplings were not the kind I enjoy, but if you enjoy pork, you should be able to enjoy this dish.  I was trying to be 'different' and go for something 'new' but usually there is a reason why you like what you like and why you should probably stick to what you like ;) Point is, we all had a good time, the plates were big, we went home with left overs, I think it was a nice experience and I do recommend it.  Just make sure you get the Schnitzel or Wurst next time ;)

Love Furio.  Every first Thursday of the month, they offer wine flight specials with an appetizer on the side.  Manicure Mondays do nothing for me.  Happy hour prices are good, food tastes great, the bar does fill up during happy hour, but the staff will seat you in the restaurant if it's not too busy and give you the same 'rates'.   Everyone is pretty friendly and approachable.  It's just a great place for happy hour or romantic dinner for two.

I have to echo Lisa J's remarks.  Best service I've ever received.  My boyfriend and I too celebrated our 2 year anniversary and I made reservations in light of Restaurant week.    We were greeted by friendly staff and seated in a nice booth decorated with confetti for our anniversary.    The food was great, yes, although my steak which was suppose to be cooked medium (ie some pink in the middle) was well done instead.  Our server alerted the manager who offered to bring out another steak but I declined.  He then offered me another glass of wine on the house and of course I agreed.  He also offered my boyfriend another drink but he was done.  Sure, they should have got the steak order right but it still tasted great, and again.. the service was phenomenal.  You don't hear any complaints from me.    Finally, as part of Restaurant week, we received two desserts and to our surprise, a *third* dessert on the house to mark our anniversary.  We had the "Chocolate Explosion" and I cannot even tell you how good this was.  The only way you might find out is by checking it out yourself.  It's devilishly good.    I highly recommend this restaurant.  The service was simply impeccable.

I love this place.   It's not just all college kids.  There are plenty of people in their 30s and upward that come here to enjoy the brewery, and food.  I love it because it's big, lots of seating, water mysters for outside, tons of people, very laid back, no dress code..  The guys can watch their sports on tv's, and the girls can just sit back and relax.  The food is great too by the way.    Seriously... I don't know what else to say but that I love everything about Four Peaks.

If you aren't in the mood for the bar / club scene, but want to go out, this is the place for you.  You wont spend much more than you would at a bar, the only difference is that you will get live entertainment and laughs at the Improv.  But not every big name is a hit.  For instance, I wouldn't recommend Richard Lewis or Jay Mohr.    Food is pretty good, I highly recommend the oven baked cookie with ice creme as dessert.  Yum.  The waiting staff are always friendly and attentive. I can always count on Improv for a good time, do some research on the comedian and if he seems your style, you and your friends/date will have a great time.   As for tickets, if you book online you pay an online fee of some ridiculous $3.00 a ticket.  Call them and see if you can get it cheaper via phone or in person. Make sure to arrive at least 30 minutes early.  You'll need more time for special events or just book dinner reservations and you'll be seated before everyone else.

On a more positive note, here is one club I do enjoy.  Now, I used to go all the time when I was single and only been once since the remodel, but  I dig the set up (spacious rooms, 4 bars, a designated area for smokers, vip seating not too far detached from everything, the crowd isn't so bad either, the ladies bathrooms rock, no cover for ladies, $10.00 for guys after 10pm).   Unfortunately, I've been noticing more and more lately how bad the music is they play there.  It used to be more of a combination of things (rock, hip/hop, rap, house), but it seems to be mostly rap/ hip/hop now and I'm not a fan.    Either way, I have to give it 4 stars.  It's been consistent, and I've had a lot of fun there.  If my friends and I have trouble deciding on a place, we usually always end up here (or Devils North, or Barcelona)

My second time taking on the Echo Canyon and I highly recommend it.   I have two perspectives:  The weak, short of breath, unfit me of 3+ years ago wanted to turn around half way up the mountain while my boyfriend at the time cursed me to keep moving as it had been my idea to hike this thing.  And so I did, somehow, out of breath, bright red in the face, reaching the summit, finally.  It was a great experience but it was missing one major component: A fit me.   So I decided to give my mom a little tour of the mountain this week.  This time around though, it was much easier.  All that working out has finally paid off! It's still a cardio work out, and will do a number on your legs, but I work out enough, it really didn't bother me.  My mom on the other hand can hardly move her legs today.  At no point did I want to turn around.    You gotta make sure to bring water.  A little bottle is not going to do, especially not in this heat.  I brought my 2 L Camelback and between the two of us, it was all gone shortly before we arrived back at the bottom.  Go early and go during the week to beat the crowd.  No mistaking, there will be people though.  Wednesday morning (around 8am) wasn't bad though.   Great fantastic views, not a long hike, but difficult and strenuous no doubt.  If you enjoy a challenge, are tired of the gym, or just want to have a fun day in the sun, I highly recommend this mountain.

The only (and I mean ONLY) reason you might want to go here is for the dance / techno dance floor.  Pretentiousness is at it's finest at Axis Radius.  I'm a former bar fly to some degree and Axis (and Myst) were always last on my list.    Not worth your money or time unless you fit into the scene.    Oh and ladies, you do pay a cover here.

I hate to be a downer on all these night clubs so far but that whole section (axis, myst, crown room, PCL, Suede) is all crap.   I can't imagine ever going here again.  People are rude, snobby, fake, the guys all have some kind of entitlement issues, the chicks are getting wasted, loud and obnoxious, and this place especially houses a lot of creepy guys.  I've never gone there and not been sexually harassed in one way or another.    I've never once had a good time at PCL.  The only times I've gone is because I've been forced to.  Kicking and screaming most likely.   One day I'll write a positive review on a few clubs I *do* enjoy but I've been feeling especially groggy today LOL

I love this place.  The sushi is some of the best sushi I've had in Phoenix.  The restaurant is pretty small and narrow, but clean, modern/trendy.  They don't have a bar, but some beers (and possibly wine, I've never checked).  It's a great place to take a date or friend.  Not really suited for big groups. I probably go here twice a month.  It's my little token sushi place.   The only negative comment I have is that they do not do happy hour.

Horrible.  I have come here three times and each experience got progressively worse.   The first time  I came based on the positive reviews.  I ordered 3 rolls.  Service was.. odd.  They brought out 1 roll at a time.  In the meantime, I was starving like crazy and quite annoyed that each time I finished one roll, I still sat there waiting for my next, and next.  I was pretty disappointed by the rolls too (can't remember which I ordered) but their saving grace was the Volcano roll which came last.    This volcano roll has had me come back 3 more times (only take out, because I didn't feel like dealing with their service again).  The first time I took out, I ordered two volcano rolls.  They were thrown together, all meshed up, never mind the presentation.  Sushi is all about presentation.  Oh well, it tasted great anyway.   The second take out, my husband and I ordered the same volcano roll x 2.  My husband wasn't so blown away and said, "That was not worth $25.00" (Have I mentioned that the roll is some $11.00??  I can go to a fancy sushi restaurant for that kind of price).  The rolls were sort of dry and thrown together with holes inside.  I chalked it up to them not caring about their take outs.  We agreed, we wouldn't come back   FF to tonight.  I was starving for sushi and I didn't want to deal with walking into the W in my PJ's, soooo.. I re-yelped Dozo and let all of these positive reviews sway me.  I ordered a volcano (Shrimp tempura with spicy tuna) and a red dragon (crab with spicy tuna).  Horrible.   Again, holes inside the sushi, and you would laugh if you saw how much shrimp was inside the sushi.  Instead, they filled with a ton of hard, dry, tempura (the breadcrumbs).  The spicy tuna wasn't spicy at all.   The crab (a $12.00 roll) was so dry and fried that the meat had turned brown.  It's like they pre-fried and then threw it in the microwave.  Many of the pieces would fall apart as soon as you tried to pick it up, it's so dry.  The only thing they got right this time : the presentation.  I didn't even recognize the volcano roll this time - I don't think thats what I ended up getting.   $26.00 for two rolls after tax for pick up - I will.never.come.back and I don't understand these reviews.    I haven't posted a review in a couple of years but after poking holes into that sushi roll to remove all those rocks of tempura, it's the first thing I did.

We came here on a Sunday at 11 for brunch. Unfortunately, a bad time for people watching.  Besides our table of 3, there was only one other table (father/daughter) occupied.  I was a little disappointed but not too surprised considering DC Ranch's 'remote' location.  However, the staff was friendly and the tapa's were great (especially the almond french toast), but if you're hungry, order big or go home.  The bartender gave us mimosa's on the house and after ordering 5 dishes, the bill only came to $45.00, split between the 3 of us.    I can see this place being a lot of fun at the right time, and very romantic as well.  I'd like to go again, but likely not for brunch.

I really like First Watch.  This location is very clean, the staff super friendly, and we were seated immediately upon arriving at 11am on a Easter Sunday.  The good egg??  Please.  Sure, it's not the world's best breakfast restaurant I've ever been to (I'm from Europe, come on...), but it definitely ranks above any of the other little chain restaurants in AZ.   In an ordinary world, I would give this Restaurant 2, or 3 stars, but we live in the desert where Originality and Menu rarely walk hand in hand.  With that said, at least I know I can depend on First Watch to deliver their dishes in a friendly, fresh, fast and (if you so choose) healthy manner.   * try the Yogurt Fruit Crepe.  * I've never noticed 'just old people' at this restaurant.  I see families and couples.  Unless you consider me old at 28, in that case, sure.  Old.

Staff: Super friendly and attentive  Lay out / atmosphere: Cozy, dimly lit, trendy, art, simply comfortable  Food: Awesome appetizers I must say, especially the hummus and cheese plate.  I had the chicken pasta, I quickly regretted my decision after everyone else's dish came out.  I'm not a big panini or sandwich girl, but the crepes' looked delicious.  I know what I'm getting next time!   Alcohol: My chardonnay was only $3.00 at happy hour.  Not bad, you rarely see wine on the happy hour menu.  The other girls had a Red Sangria, a red wine loaded with fresh fruit (berry's, and apple), it was looking very yummy... .....   It's a very nice lounge/restaurant/bar but I'm not a big fan of the 'sandwich menu'.  I wish it offered a bigger variety of foods, but I am pretty sure anyone can find something on this menu that will satisfy.   And if not, there's always Fez ;)

My new favorite place to eat breakfast!  Despite the parking lot being packed, we were seated right away, served great food, the man was able to watch some football, and I had plenty of people watching to do.    Finally, a flexible menu, none of the same ole'.   Big servings, definately splittable, and the cake looks wonderful.  Next time, we will grab one on the way out.    4.5 stars.  All that's missing is crepes.

I've always liked Benihanas.    Even if Arizona's Benihana's doesn't resemble the authenticism of those in San Francisco.  The cooks in Arizona are generally NOT asian, which really is my only disappointment with these local restaurants. It just gives it another feel.  However, the food is great, the atmosphere is nice.  Just some advise:  The tables sit 8 people.  Try to go with a large group or you will get stuck with several strangers (loud, obnoxious and drunk perhaps?).  It's not really a romantic setting in those conditions.    Also, allow over 2 hrs for dinner.  We got there at 6:30 and left at 8pm (we made it just in time for our movie at 8:25pm).    I will go again, next time, with a larger group.

Eh.  It's entertaining.  You are paying for the entertainment with higher food prices for food that really isn't all that impressive.    Not sure what's changed for me.  Maybe my taste buds have gotten wiser over the last 3 years.

I have never been a member of any other Yoga Studio so I have nothing else to compare it to, but after being with Metta for about a year, I can with all sincerity say that I never want to leave... (although I may have to once I move :()   Suzanna is my favorite...  her classes are never the same.   She also has a wonderful personality, you can't go wrong with metta.

Really bad.  The Mac N Cheese tasted like it was powdered cheese with no bite/spice.  Also, we thought it was odd that they brought out the mac n cheese 5 minutes before our ribs came out.  We returned it.  We were told that they have a new menu.  The waiter was very nice, recommended the green beans and comped our side.  The green beans  and the local beer were the best part of the meal.   We got the whole rack of ribs and only ate half and left the rest.  It was dry, not tender, no flavor.  This, even though we were told it was ranked Phoenix best??   Then our bill came out wrong - they added an additional $22 to the bill by accident.  Mistakes happen, but this was overall just bad.  Won't return.
