Not only is John a perfectionist and WILL do the job right the first time, which saves me money and time. He will also let you know what to watch for your next maintenance. It is hard to find a mechanic you can trust, but I found him!! Thanks John for all you do!!

I went to another tanning place and I never got the tan I got here!! I am fair skin so it is not easy to get tan. I am very happy with the results in such a short time!! Not going back to the other place!!!

I give it no stars!! I had fraud on my credit card that I was using to let them make auto withdrawals from so I had to cancel the card. Came back to Tanmax to start again. They want me to pay for two months I didn't go!!! They said I never cancelled. I told them that I had fraud and was out of town and could not come in. I tried calling but NO ONE answers the phone. This is after being a loyal customer for over 4 months. If this is how they treat customers... Hell no.

I changed my rating. I was so upset but corporate office called and took care of everything. Simple mistake and they owned it. Got to give Tanmax credit for stepping up. It shows they care about their customers. I'm very happy with Tanmax!!

Always friendly and the customers come first!! Went to another nail salon and no one even looked up to say hi. The owner here would not do that. He makes you feel very welcome. I was offered water or soda several times by different staff members. They all care and want your business.

Always great service. Only had one issue and the owner, Tang, took care of it right away!
