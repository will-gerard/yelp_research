We got a calendar from Half Moon on Super Bowl Sunday and have gone in many times since then.  There are free items when you buy the calendar every month.  Happy hour and reverse happy hours are great with $3 draft beers and half off wings and other apps. My husband is a huge fan of the wings!

We came during happy hour from 3-6pm. We got wings and pretzels. I have never seen a smaller chicken wing but tasty. Pretzels were tasty especially with beer cheese. Ordered BBQ chicken pizza, great! Ordered Hot Potato pizza and it was very spicy! Ranch dressing with jalapenos was hot, hot, hot.

As a vegetarian it is hard to find fresh fast food to enjoy.  This place is awesome!  I order the tostada every time and have never been disappointed.  Especially on Wednesday when it is the deal of the day and discounted.   They have a wonderful house ranch dressing that is great on all the items as well.  My husband orders the sweet BBQ in burritos and loves it.  It doesn't cost extra for enchilada style which makes seem like you are in a sit down Mexican restaurant.  I would rather go here than any other Mexican restaurant hands down.  I also love the different drinks that they have there which you can't get anywhere else such as mint limeade and many other tasty drinks.  During lunch if you order ahead it's easy to just come and pick up your meals.  They even have a punch card so after you buy 10 meals you get one free.  I LOVE this place.

I was excited to try a new place but wasn't very impressed with the food.  I order a veggie quesadilla, guacamole and chips, and an horchata.  The quesadilla had soggy lettuce and onion inside and the horchata was too sweet.  It also cost a lot for a small portion of food.  It was fast and smelled amazing so maybe if you order a meat item it would be good.  Friends ordered taco's and said they were good but small.  What's interesting is that each meal comes with a radish, slice of lime and cucumber.  Might wait a while and give it another shot once it's settled in.

If you want a healthy option for pizza and like different choices come to My Pie. I have brought many of my friends here because it's so small you can miss it. (At night it's pretty though with colored lights out on the patio) You can build your own pizza or choose one of their great selections. I got the Greek pizza with yummy fresh ingredients. My husband got a great pizza as well called the Uncle Nicky. We signed up for their texts and got a pizza and drink for $7. John loves that he can get beer for $4 and a refill for $2.   I am happy every time! With pizza, extreme garlic knots, and melt in your mouth chocolate chip cookies this is one of my favorite places.
