Decent.  They try to work through everyone as quick as possible.  They do make the sandwiches correctly here, unlike some subways that cut corners.  Occasionally, you get some YASS-HO that orders $125 worth of subs at 12 PM during everyone's lunch time.  Yes, that happened and yes the staff did the best they could.    I go here often, so I'll be back...

They always have good food and know how to move through a long line quickly.  My favorite is the Turkey.  While their prices are slightly higher than Subway, the quality is substantially better.  At least I know I am getting real meat here, and the bread has good flavor.  At Subway, that is questionable at best.  I recommend the Turkey with Jalapenos and a bag of Baked Chips on the side.

This dealership is absolutely amazing.  I worked with Dennis Goad through the internet department.  I purchased a 2012 Audi A4.  When I showed up at the lot he had the car that I was interested in right out front and ready for me to test drive.  They quickly evaluated my trade and came back with a reasonable estimate.  I told him where I wanted to be on the price and trade and he met me there.  He spent time with me helping me choose the right financing strategy so that I would pay the least amount of interest over time.  He thoroughly explained every feature on the car by showing me and also hooked up my phone to the Bluetooth.  When it came to do the finance stuff, I was dreading this task.  This the point in the car buying process where they usually do the hard-sell.  This was not the case at all at this dealership.  The financing rep was very nice and showed me the options I had with zero pressure to buy anything.  Its funny because I ended up buying multiple extras just because of the manor in which she presented everything.  I even received a follow-up call from Dennis and finance the next day to make sure I was happy with my purchase and to see if I had any questions.  Overall, I was extremely pleased with this dealer.  Anyone looking to purchase an Audi should definitely contact Dennis Goad at this dealership.  Lastly, thank you to the dealer for making this my best car buying experience this year (This is the 3rd new car I've bought this year).

I wish I could give this location a big fat ZERO.  But you can't.  But I can let everyone know how horrible it is.  For starters, their automatic doors do not even work.  I just find that appalling.  How can your doors not work on your store?  How are people supposed to get in there to shop.  The manager of this location is nothing more than a jerk.  I asked for help and all I received was attitude.  For a struggling supermarket that filed for bankruptcy, I would think service would be one thing you could promote at no cost.  But, not here.  I don't think it will be long before this location closes.  RIP!

This Outback Location is absolutely on top of everything.  From the moment you walk in, the place is so clean. The service is always excellent.  I was there yesterday and was just so amazed at how attentive the wait staff was.  The Manager, I believe his name is Jim, is always at the Restaurant.  Numerous times he has come up our table and made sure our meal was excellent.  Yesterday, my friend didn't like the tea he ordered, the waiter could tell from a distance and came right over and asked if there was a different drink he could get him.  Now I am the first one to be critical of an establishment but this place definitely deserves 5 stars.  They go above and beyond in every aspect.  I live in Far West Valley but it is worth the drive to go to this location.

Like an old woman in North Scottsdale, this place has too seen its best days.   This place was one great, but around the beginning of this year it started heading towards a slow death spiral. I had been consistently coming here near weekly for a few years. The staff and food were great. Always very consistent. Over the past six months or so, the familiar faces started disappearing and food quality went down hill. I kept saying "let's try it one more time, maybe it was a fluke."  However, it just keeps getting worse. The meals were once prepared neatly, now sloppy. Ingredients once in the salads, have now disappeared.   I really love this place and I hope they pull it back together before it's too late.

Just absolutely amazing.  That is all I can say about these guys.  We primarily see Dr. Davis, but also saw Dr. Newland on an emergency today.  He was just as awesome.    They show their care and compassion with a side of dedication.  Dr. Davis goes out of his way to keep us updated on our pets, even calling from his vacation to see how they are and update us.  He speaks in a clear concise manner and takes time to thoroughly answer all of our (many) questions since we are over obsessed pup parents.  We have never felt rushed in their office.  In addition, their fees are fair and upfront.  The staff here has also been amazing.  It is clear that they have handpicked the very best from the industry.  I highly recommend this office.

This used to be such a fun, energetic place to come. Now, I feel like I'm going to a funeral that has food.   You enter through a gigantic outdoor patio that is never used. It really does not encourage you to come inside. The place once was more of a destination restaurant, rather than just a place to eat some crappy Mexican food (yes, Filli Bs is probably better).  The owners have sadly not maintained the restaurant or updated the menu. The food has become drab.  I'll be surprised if this place is around much longer.....

Amazing! Yummy! Perfected!  That is three words to describe my experience (and many other experiences) at this restaurant.  The place is managed well from the top down.  I am always greeted immediately upon entry and have never (regardless of the hour) waited more than 30 seconds for a table.    Last night I had the Turkey Burger (outstanding, btw) and the sweet potato fries. I had the best service from Tara who was totally personable and on top of our drinks, meal, etc.  In the end she recommended a unique dessert that can only be found at their restaurant.  It was a chocolate cake with cream cheese icing and your choice of a flavor of ice cream.  I had the strawberry.  The dessert was spot on and I will definitely come back hungry for it.    I really do not think you can go wrong with their food. I have had many meals like the panini's, burgers, salads here over the past 3-4 years and they have always been good and consistent.  As a reminder, you get what you pay for, and I have no problem paying their reasonable prices for good quality food.  I can't wait to go back.

Stumbled in here on Sunday evening looking for a bag to carry my Yorkie Puppy in when we go out on the town.  I had checked all the top designers like Gucci and Louis but was disappointed with those stores stock.  So coming here was a positive experience.  Galoris, the sales associate, helped me find exactly the perfect bag,  Even the pooch loves it.  She was one of the sweetest, kind hearted sales associates I have seen in Scottsdale.  This wasn't a large purchase for their store but she made me feel special. I will definitely go in here next time I am looking for something out of the ordinary.  Thanks for the great service!

Food is good.  Service is pretty good.  Its a restaurant that definitely reminds you of LA, as it is very loud in there.  Definitely will go back.

What?  The pizza is so good I ended up eating every slice.    I was here late one night for a couple of drinks and next thing I knew we were ordering a pizza.  I had the Margharita Pizza.  It came very quickly despite the restaurant/bar being busy.  I had no issues with the service as the entire staff was very attentive.  I only wish I could get here more often.  Next time I will be sure to try some of their other food and report back.    P.S. Most of their drinks are very good, however, their Mojito was a bit off.

A bit disappointed with this location. I have leased at Public Storage locations all throughout the country over the years and I don't feel that this location lives up to their standards. I had not been to the unit in the summertime yet and I immediately noticed that the air conditioning is making it very damp in the unit at the temperature was rather warm and musty in there.  In addition I had a couple of items that I needed to throw in the trash and the management would not let me put it in the dumpster. They say you have to haul it away. I've never met a storage company that didn't provide trash. I also rent at Extra Space around the corner and they provide a jumbo dumpster for customer use.   I have been here six months and they have already raised my rent once. All in all, I know this location was converted to a Public Storage and I just don't recommend. Look elsewhere for a place that meets your needs

I have to say, I have never been a Chapman Fan.  However, it was Saturday on Labor Day Weekend, I wanted a new car and the other dealers were giving me the run around.  (Come all the way to the West Valley for a "free TV" Free? Yeah, right. Am I looking to buy a TV anyways? No, I want a car)  I did an Internet Inquiry on their website and I received a near instant reply from Justin Harris who did not waste my time on the "normal" dealer games.  His sales manager, Andrew Lucas called me as they didn't have the exact color I wanted.  Nonetheless,  he asked me to hold tight and give him (and Justin) an hour or two and one of them would find it.  Sure enough, a couple hours later he called me with a firm time that the exact car I wanted would be at his dealership.    I arrived at the dealer, none of the normal games I have had in the past ("The oh there is a speck of dirt on your trade, now it's worth $2000 less) so I really appreciated it.  He had the car ready for me to inspect right out front.  We test drove it and it was exactly what I wanted.  He then needed a little time to get the car clean and polished which I completely understood as they just drove it all the way from the Southeast Valley for me.    Next, we went in to finance and met with a very prepared Zoe.  He had the agreed price and everything correct on the forms, the first time.  I say this because shady dealers will usually try to play the bait and switch game in finance and put the car in for a different price (Oh, that was just a typo), but none of that nonsense here.  In and out in under five minutes.  No games in here.  No mystical protection from alien space creatures was forced upon me to buy.  Side note: I did let them know I usually don't buy any of that stuff as I only keep a car until its warranty is up.  But all around nice guy and was easy to work with.  No wasting my time.  Last stop, Justin helped me remove everything from my old car and then put it in my new car.  He did a tour of the vehicle with me and explained and setup lots of features including the keyless buttons to unlock the doors. (I had no clue how they worked or how cool they were).  It was nice to see that he knew what he was doing and could quickly show me features.  It was not like he was figuring it out for the first time.  He clearly knew what he was doing.  I highly recommend these folks.  As with any dealership, go in prepared and you are always better off.  However, I felt like after being in their dealer for a while that the majority of their sales people have integrity and work out a fair deal for everyone.  Thanks!

I had the unfortunate experience of getting slammed into by a lady in a large Mercedes.  She took responsibility but I needed collision work for my car.  I called Chapman and I spoke with a very chipper and energetic Matt in the collision department.  He met with me the same day, and got my car in ASAP.  I found him to be professional and honest and I liked that he was not another monotone drone in the service world.  I would definitely go back.  I have also had the pleasure of working with John in service.  He almost always answers his phone, and if for some reason he misses your call, he gets back to you right away.  He has handled my routine service and minor warranty issues and I was pleased. Their estimates have always been reasonable so I definitely recommend their service department.      I rarely recommend auto dealerships, but I would say these guys are pretty top notch and as long as you know your stuff, I would buy another car here.  Thanks again!

I came back to buy a new Mustang from these guys.  I dealt with Jerry Lynch in Internet.  He had the car parked up front when I came in.  I was shocked at how much he knew about the features on the car.  He was explaining things with confidence like he had been working at the factory. I really appreciated that.    I was not able to finalize the deal immediately because of a minor credit issue which took a few days to get resolved.  Jerry stayed in touch the entire time and was accommodating once I was ready.  The sales managers (I know one was Lance and I forgot the other guys name, both were really nice though) provided an accurate idea of interest rate.  When I arrived in finance, they were able to get a firm approval on my loan before leaving, and even told me the bank name, interest rate, etc.  Within days, I was able to log in to the bank website and view my account (yes days, no endless weeks of worrying about financing here).    Overall, I am extremely happy. I got exactly the car I wanted, at the price I wanted and I did not feel that shady shit was going on.  I found everyone I dealt with to be extremely honest and forthright in their dealings.  This is the second car I have bought from Chapman Ford and I will definitely come back.  They represent car dealers and Ford in a whole different light.  As a side note, I see people complain about spot-deliveries or loans not going through.  Come on people, I am not a perfect credit score master either, but how can you expect a bank to give you a loan with no or minimal down and less than stellar credit?  Take some responsibility for your own situation and buy a vehicle when you have the cash to make a downpayment, and once you have resolved your debts.  Don't blame the dealer when your loan doesn't go through.  Be smart, and don't take the vehicle until they have final loan approval.  Bravo's to the team here and I will be back when I am ready for another vehicle.

Overall, very pleased with Sierra's handling of their auctions.  I have spent in the tens of thousands at their Auction's this year and they really get some great items through their doors.  I personally like their off site auctions at their client's locations.  They just are not so congested and are easier to navigate.  It can be hit or miss as to how many people are there and bidding on the items you want.  I have found historically that at their larger auctions, there is enough to go around so to speak.  You will see many of the same people at every auction and I have made some great local and out of state contacts through that.    Their auctioneers especially know how to engage the bidders and I appreciate that as it makes the task of spending lots of money fun.  I recommend paying in cash to save the 3% Credit Card Fee.  Also, read up on their auction terms and types of auctions as I always see someone that got confused and ended up buying more then they should even though the auctioneers called out the terms at the beginning.  These things move fast and I found it best when first getting started to watch one whole auction before ever bidding so you understand the flow.   The only thing I would really like to see them hone in on is customer service.  Occasionally, issues arise and I think it would be great if they had one point of contact or phone number available to assist bidders.  This applies more so to their online auctions as there is always plenty of staff available on site.  This could be a positive for them as they could follow-up with the larger spenders as well and remind them to get their butts to the next auction.  So great experience!  Go buy some stuff!

Tonight was my second time trying Mexx 32 since its remodel and transition from Revo.  It was outstanding.  I am so happy that they are up and running again and their remodel looks awesome.  The center bar concept that they have introduced is really unique.  First the service, top notch.  Tonight I was served by James who had an excellent personality, likes to make his customers laugh, is full of energy and had great interaction.  All too often wait staff disappears in the back to use their cell phones, not here.  Their staff and management is engaging their customers and making sure they are pleased.  It is obvious that they have handpicked the best of the best to serve here.    I had the Chicken Fajita Bowl this evening which was HOT, fresh and full of flavor.  Try it with the creamy rice and ask them for some Tomatio (hope I spelled that right) salsa to go on top.  They made some minor changes (or should I say upgrades) to the bowl since its Revo version, like cheese on top, but I have to say that it is very good.   They are constantly tweaking the menu and I will say that tonight's bowl was even better than the one I had last week when they had just re-opened.  Overall, the whole team here is making a constant effort to exceed customer expectations.  During my visit tonight I had the opportunity to chat with Austin, Todd and Lenny and their devotion to listening to their customers suggestions and implementing them is appreciated and unprecedented for restaurants in this area.  It is obvious that their commitment to the location is strong and I wish them the best and can't wait to go back :)

Can't say much good about this place, except for the staff.  If you are used to the common Aloft, you won't find it here.  This place has a just plain weird layout, small lobby, no food service and rooms with tiny windows.   In addition, it is very close to MANY local watering holes, and therefore you will see "less than desirables" walking around, other guests talking about their narcotic use in the elevator, and the NOISE is obnoxious.  We were on the 5th floor and the pounding bass did not stop until 3 AM every night.    There is also lots of construction next door, but I was there on a weekend so they were not working.    Your best bet is to stay somewhere else.
