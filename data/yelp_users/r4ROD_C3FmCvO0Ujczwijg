They honored an Oil Change discount on their website, no questions asked. No surprise fees or surcharges and was done quickly.  Employees were very nice and "informed" me of some other things that could be replaced soon on my car but didn't proceed with a high pressure "your car may explode" sales pitch with the additional services.

I get all my furniture at Big Lots and save hundreds. I can safely write a review about it being great quality because I have now owned furniture I bought from there for years and it is just as good a quality as anything you'd pay thousands for at Roomstore or Ashley.  We got an entire outdoor wicker furniture set here for $1,000 that has withstood hot summers, we've seen similar sets for $2,000 and more. Don't let these furniture places try and tell you how great their stuff is and why they are justified charging three times as much. If you pay attention to what you're buying, it all comes from China anyway.

I went to Goldie's and I said, "Let there be Hot Sicilian Focaccia" and there was Hot Sicilian Focaccia. I saw that the Hot Sicilian Focaccia was good, and ate it.

Had an expired groupon that they probably shouldn't have accepted because they thought it was for the East Valley Midas locations. They did offer me a credit for what I paid for the Groupon towards an oil change just to be nice, changed my oil promptly, even showed me an air filter that needed to be replaced without a high pressure sales pitch saying that I could die if I don't replace it, but that they simply suggest it be changed. They put proper air pressure in my tires also. Highly recommended since the honoring of the groupon isn't the standard greediness and price gouging that one would expect from an auto repair facility and likely reflects the quality of work they offer as a whole.

Place is a little expensive compared to the refined"dollar menu" palate I usually have, but their seafood is great, the free biscuits are great, and the servers are professional and nice.  Last visit was Father's Day 2015 for me and despite it being very busy, our server was checking in every few minutes to make sure we didn't need anything, the food was brought quickly, and the manager stopped by just to make sure we having a pleasant experience.

I love this, and all taco bells, they always get my order right, have new things, are friendly, and the food is bomb (even for fast food)  Nothing like 3 huge burritos for $4 instead of shriveled soggy burgers you get on other "dollar menu" items.

Great food, reasonably priced drinks, and the best turkey with chipotle mayo I've ever had. Only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the fact that you don't get service on the outside patio (not sure about being seated inside) you need to go stand in line at the bar inside every time you need something, menu, napkins, water, etc. I was there in the evening so going to the bar may not be that big of a deal during the day. Also, no smoking allowed on the patio until after 10 pm, won't apply to most people but I enjoy an occasional cigarette with a beer.

This place has an "expensive feel" with the nice decor and waiters with white towels draped over their arms, yet they have reasonable prices on all of their entrees. My favorite part of eating here is the attentive staff. Empty plates, refills, and anything extra needed was addressed very quickly without having to flag down or grab the arm of your waiter/waitress as they run by to get some ranch or more water.

I've always loved eating at Valle Luna because of the food and the specials they have throughout the week. We recently purchased food from them for a party of 40 people. It was an ultimate party platter the cheese enchilada casserole. Their food purchased in bulk is just as good as in the restaurant on a single plate, they don't cut corners and slap something together fast just because it is a large order. We had 40 mini tacos on the platter and each one looked as it had been topped by hand, rather than just handfuls of toppings thrown at the plate.  The price was also very reasonable, if you've ever bought food for large amounts of people from a restaurant, then you'll see a great value in getting the food for less than $5 per person.

Got a great deal on a 7 piece dining set that probably would have been double at a "conventional" furniture store. It had a slight crack in one of the chairs that is no longer visible after they fixed it for no additional charge. Still, about a year later, their "fix" on the chair is holding up fine.

Since I've been old enough to drive, I've bought all my tires at Discount Tire. Their price has never been beaten between several competitors and they include free rotations and tire pressure checks simply for buying tires there. I have never had a negative experience with any of their staff.  My most recent experience was me noticing my tire going flat overnight in the garage, had the initial "oh god, how much is this going to cost" moment and changed my tire. Took it to Discount and they fixed it, no charge, no fees, fast service, just a "thanks for coming by, see you again soon!" from yet another friendly Discount tire employee.

I have never had a problem with Wells Fargo, either in person or by support via phone. The employees have always been understanding of my concerns and addressed them quickly with a polite and professional demeanor. I even have a mortgage through them that gave me a great rate with lowest possible closing costs I could find out of about 10 different brokers, it is also incredibly convenient to have my mortgage linked to my bank accounts and see everything with one online login.  I would give them a perfect rating but they kind of need to be watched for monthly maintenance fees suddenly appearing on my statements when the criteria to have the fees seems to change unexpectedly. Of course this has only happened twice in 8 years.

The prices or so-so, not amazing deals to go nuts over, about the same as a regular home improvement store, maybe a TINY BIT less. The customer service is not good, you can stand around waiting for someone to answer a question forever and end up just breaking down and going to find someone in the store and walking them over to where you were standing and waiting.  I have bought and returned things from the Glendale location on 4 separate occasions within about a month's period for a kitchen remodel and every single time I am in line waiting at least 15 minutes, not because they are busy, or there are long lines, it just seems like they always have only 1 - 2 cashiers on duty at any given time and are very slow at returns/purchases.  The only time I would suggest coming here is if your tile or flooring contractor requires you to. You can get way better service at a standard home improvement store and I can't really see a price difference.

My wife had a procedure here and the nurses were exceptionally prompt and friendly. My wife was well taken care of and her comfort was of utmost importance to them.  I even spent the night there with her and was treated as a patient with water, blankets, or pillows when I needed them.  I highly recommend Piper if you have any choice in an outpatient surgery center, you will feel very comfortable here.

Brought my Jetta here in May after a no-fault accident and chose this body shop simply because it was closest to me. I have never used a body shop so I wasn't sure of the process, but my estimator, Tulio, explained everything and how it worked, and he even handled the insurance back-and-forth completely. Repairs were seamless and they even fixed minor scratches on my car that weren't related to the accident. Got my car back and the wheel alignment was a little off and they took the car back to correct it immediately, no questions asked. These guys are all about customer satisfaction and I would definitely trust them in the future.

Great and unique breakfast entrees, fast service even on the busiest days and very good service. I recently went in to buy a gift card as a gift and had to wait a few minutes and during this time the manager brought some free juice boxes out to my kids. Very nice business that is very conscious of their customer's satisfaction.

I had a good experience here, I've had the same "smart" phone for 4 years and it stopped working, the model was no longer made so I needed a new one. It was a seemingly busy Saturday with a lot of the people in the store but somehow the wait to see someone was only about 5 minutes. They walked me through their selection of phones and ordered a new one for me which arrived promptly.

Called to get an estimate and Rich was able to have me briefly describe what I was needing and he quoted me a price over the phone and then made an appointment within 3 days.  I had new granite counters installed on an island and some plumbing done and there was a gaping hole in the wall from the plumbing repair and drywall cut out for granite support brackets, he not only was on time, but gave me a call 15 minutes prior to let me know he was on the way.  Rich is about the nicest person I've ever met, he assured me it would look great when he was done and that he has been doing it for over 30 years and will make sure its perfect before he leaves.  It was perfect, he even took extra time to smooth the texture to match the existing texture perfectly, price was exactly what he quoted on the phone. All this and with an estimate that was lower than any other quote I got.

This was the only plumbing company that came out on a Saturday to fix a leaking and broken garbage disposal which was great. The plumber did a great job and was very fast.  The price was a little high, I've used plumbers in the past and almost $300 for 45 mins worth of work seemed very high, I understand that it would be expensive on a Saturday, but it wasn't high due to a "weekend fee" or anything, I was just charged about $5 - $15 for every piece of pipe used (things you can get at home depot for about a fourth of that price.) So i recommend them if you're in a bind and need a plumber right away, but if they charge the same during normal business hours on a weekday, I would use a cheaper plumber.

This review is on the venue, not the comedians, the show was great. It was my first time here (and at any place that had a "drink minimum") so I wanted to try some of their specialty drinks even though they were about $15 each.  These mixed drinks are about 80% ice and I went through 3 in an hour and wish I had just gotten the overpriced beers since I felt nothing. I guess that is what you'll get for drinks that you're forced to purchase.  If you want to be drunk, or tipsy, or anything other than stone sober, be prepared to spend $100+ or just pre-game somewhere else before you show up.

Can't beat happy hour every day, the chicken nachos were great and they also have a great beer selection. Service was also quick despite a busy Saturday night.  They boast being a rock pub but sprinkled in some other music I wouldn't consider rock (like songs by Avicii and other pop? hip hop? contemporary?) I guess I'm too old to even know what I'm listening to.

Used Turn It On Electric twice in the last month for a new home we bought in Phoenix and very happy with the price and prompt arrival. Most convenient thing about them is, that on both occasions, they were able to provide an estimate by phone that was within $20 of the actual price, VERY convenient not to schedule an estimate, then schedule the repair.   They were also about $50 - $100 less than the best quote we got from other LICENSED electricians in the area. I would definitely use them again, they stand behind their work, one of the things they completed for me was a ceiling fan installation on a 16' high vaulted ceiling, when they were finished and left, I noticed the fan making a clicking noise when running. They came right back and fixed it, no extra fee, no questions asked.

I know writing a review about a gas station is stupid, but every Quik Trip is clean, has a wide selection of drinks, candy, treats, food, etc. and the employees are always friendly and fast checking you out.  This company deserves credit for standing out in an industry where poor service and filthy restrooms is pretty much standard and expected. If I need a gas station or needing a bathroom on the road, I would drive the extra distance to nearly run out of gas or soil myself to get to a QT instead of any other gas station.

I loved this little gym when I lived in Gilbert (had to change because I now live in North Phoenix) it is quiet and never crowded to the point where it is unbearable. Their prices were all laid out up front, monthly, annual, and registration. There were no surprise fees even when cancelling.   I know it seems weird writing a review about how easy it was to cancel, but if you've ever tried to cancel a gym membership before, they ask you to do some strange things like mail a letter somewhere (usually doesn't get found the first time around), fax something, email some special code to somewhere, none of these methods make sense since they were able to set up billing and membership right there in the gym.

Had carpet done in our new home several months ago, price here was about $1,000 less than the next lowest estimate. No surprise charges, no high pitch upsells, carpet looks great and installed in one day. giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the person scheduled to come measure was 2 hours late, and couldn't measure because the current homeowners had to leave (we were still waiting to close at this time) the missed measurement appointment caused me to guess the sq footage myself coming up short one entire room, we didn't have time to reschedule because we were moving in within a few days. Its an inconvenience having the downstairs bedroom with different carpet but its worth it for the great price we got.

Like almost any Gym, there are pros and cons. Ill start with the benefits first since I feel they outweigh the cons of this gym.  Their monthly fees, cancellation fees, and annual "convenience fees" (or whatever places like this like to call  them) were all brought up and made clear prior to signup. I've been to a lot of gyms where they say "XXX dollars per month and that's it." and leave out the $600 cancel fee, or the annual fee of $200 you pay once a year on top of your monthly.  Best of all, the gym is NOT crowded and is usually quiet with no loud grunting or weights being thrown around by guys trying out for world's strongest (and loudest) man.  The "kids care" is a bit lacking, the weird hours will throw you off (closed fridays, only open 8am - 12pm saturday and sunday) and is really just one room filled with baby toys and a TV, so if you have kids over 5 years old, highly suggest they bring something to do or will just be sitting and staring.  The staff is mainly high school students that have to ask someone else if you ever have a question, but you never really talk to them.  All in all, the gym is great because of the price and no crowds.

It is true that everytime you call it takes anywhere from 5 - 10 minutes to get a question answered but this is majorly outweighed by the success of my procedure.  "Nervous" was an understatement, but Dr. Kaplan assured me it was a routine procedure he does often and the entire process was about 10 minutes.  It actually ended up being about 3 minutes per "side" and no complications after. Very smooth procedure that was worth the "average" customer service.

I don't know which Centurylink yelp listing to review, this one just happened to be closest to my house. Pros of Centurylink is that they are cheaper than Cox  Cons are the customer service, I spent 45 minutes just trying to update my credit card to pay my bill and they said I needed some special code to do that via chat. The account number, address, SSN, and even the providing the current CC being used is not enough to change the form of payment without the magic code I was never given. They wanted to mail it to me and have me sit in chat queue again for 45 minutes when I get my letter.  Tried calling support and they are only open during normal weekday business hours, which I guess is fine, but if you run a large company like this, some weekend support would be nice like Amex, T-Mobile, or any other company that needs to provide 24/7 support. If money is no issue, definitely recommend someone else for internet service.

I would avoid this company if you have the option, they have covered the things I needed when I needed it (which is what they're supposed to do.) but their system and customer service is probably the worst I've experienced. EVERY time you call, no matter how small the issue, expect at least a 45 minute hold time, I've tried at many different times during the day and nothing is faster. It took me 3 months to even get my insurance cards when I started, and I was using a tattered piece of paper for doctors visits. They don't list the copays on my card, so I always have to get a bill mailed from the doctor's office and pay it several weeks later.  And probably the worst is making payments online, they mail you invoices a week after the bill was due so you have to know the exact of your payment and make it monthly before the 1st since it doesn't show the balance due until after your payment is PAST due. If you think you're saving money by picking them, spend a little more and avoid the headache.
