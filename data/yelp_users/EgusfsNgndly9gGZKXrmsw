I checked out this dealership on Yelp prior to visiting them as I found them online and was interested in a truck they had listed on Cars.com.  I read the Yelp reviews... some great, and some poor and decided I'd make a visit to see the truck even though they had some pretty bad reviews on here.  I don't live in Vegas, but am in town right now for Pubcon (a Search Marketing conference) for the next few days.  I contacted them and let them know I wanted to set up an appointment with them on Wed. morning to see the specific truck I was interested in.  We scheduled the appointment a few days prior to me being in town.  I then called them Wed. morning about an hour prior to my appointment to confirm the appointment and to make sure the truck I wanted was there.  I let them know I'd be by in about an hour and was looking forward to seeing the truck.  Appointment confirmed.  I show up at 9:45 am, about 50 min. after I called and am greeted outside by a sales woman.  She brings me in, sits down and asks my name, pulls up my appointment and then takes me over to see the manager.  The manager pulls up my appointment and says to me - "oh, you're hear to see truck X, (not listing what I want so I don't get spammed here by other dealers) it's really nice."  She then calls over a salesman to take me over to the trucks location and show it to me.  I head out the door with him and after a hundred yards or so as we're heading toward another building he tells me that the truck I am interested in was sold yesterday.  At this point, I'm annoyed! not because the truck is sold, but because NO ONE told me that when they had a chance to save me the trouble and time it took to go there, check in, talk to the manager, etc.  I'm in town on business and making a trip out of my way to see this truck and they knew it was sold... so why keep my appointment? Why invite me in?  Why send me to the manager and a salesman?  Simple answer, they figured why tell him it's sold; let's just get him in here and see if we can sell him something else instead.  PROBLEM is that is a total waste of my time.  Initially I thought, maybe they didn't know it had sold when we spoke on the phone to confirm the appointment???  Now that I've thought about it more, I don't buy it though and that's why I'm giving them a bad review here and I don't buy the manager telling me: "oh, you're hear to see truck X, it's really nice" and here's why.  After I spoke to the manager and she called over the salesman she wanted to help me, we walked right outside and began talking while walking toward the lot and on the way he told me the truck had sold.  He didn't have any paperwork to check on it, he didn't call anyone on the way, we didn't go to an empty stall and then he called someone and said, where is X truck at?  He just knew that I was there to see the truck and it had sold the day before.  Anyway, after he told me the truck had sold I told him my visit there was a waste of time and that I wished they would have told me earlier, etc.  He quickly checked his inventory to see if they had anything else on the lot that was similar to what I wanted and they didn't and that was that, I left.

I can truly say that after meeting Lucille, my life has improved significantly.  Every time I'm in Vegas I look forward to eating at Lucille's.  The food here is amazing and some of the best BBQ I have ever had.  The atmosphere is great for business and family lunches and dinners.  Just tonight the waiter went above and beyond and sugared the top of the jar that my strawberry lemonade was in to make it all the better.    I get the Porch Combo most of the time with the baby backs and the tri-tip and also really love the rolls and butter they bring out.  This place is MONEY!

We visited here a while back and got the Chicken Rocatto pizza and the Chicken salad sandwich.  I would say it was pretty good...  I'm not a RAVING fan, but did enjoy it for sure.

It's been awhile since I ate here so this review isn't fresh in my mind.. but the size of the sushi rolls are still there.  I ordered 3 rolls cause I was starving and hadn't eaten any sushi for months and the rolls were HUGE!  Much larger than any other place I've been to and very yummy.  I will be back when in Queen Creek for sure!

I referred a good friend of mine in Mesa to Tree Doctors and they had an excellent experience.  The work done turned out very nice and they provided excellent customer service as well.  I am happy that my friend found a great tree service company and happy that the service they received was so excellent, given that I referred them.  Good work Tree Doctors.
