We came to Cowboy Ciao during restaurant week and were expecting to have a great time. While the food was all pretty good, the service and the atmosphere was kind of a bust. The restaurant was FREEZING. Like 63 degrees....and we got sat directly under one of the vents. And the restroom was even colder. The food itself was pretty good- scallops with risotto app, pork with (not so great) acorn squash mash, and the filet, finished with the bread pudding (awesome). It took a good 15-20 minutes between each course and the waitress kept apologizing for the wait but we were starving! The filet was recommended medium, and my friend ordered it medium well. When it was brought to the table, it was definitely rare. She showed the waitress who agreed it was not medium well and took the steak back to get the temp brought up. That took another 10 minutes and by the time it was brought out, the rest of us had eaten about half of our meal and the other half of it became so cold because the vent was blowing cold air directly on it. I guess it's our fault for not speaking up to have our food taken back to have it heated up again (which is kind of gross in the first place) but the entire staff looked like they were ready to get the hell out of there closing up shop and then sitting at the bar for a drink when they were done. We would have gotten out of their hair sooner had the time between courses been a little quicker. We had all finished eating and for about 15 minutes our dirty dishes sat in front of us while the staff continued to clean and close. Once we ordered dessert, it took exactly (yes we even joked a little and timed it because of the 2 previous courses) 21 minutes to get.....21 minutes!? When she dropped it off she apologized again and told us "I'm so sorry the kitchen staff all left so there was nobody to make it, I guess they didn't realize we still had a table."   Sooooo that was the finale to what could have been a great meal. Luckily this was restaurant week so it was a deal with 3 courses @ $40 a person (normal entrees there are 30-40 individually) The majority of our bill was on wine that we kept ordering between courses because it was taking so long. Every restaurant week we choose 1 place to go to and we were really looking forward to this...unfortunately, it left a pretty bitter taste in all our mouths and I don't  think we will be going back :/

I cannot believe this place hasn't been talked about more! We came here last week for restaurant week and I could not stop thinking about the food! The special menu was 33/pp, came with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd course AND a glass of Sangria. When I heard free sangria I automatically thought it would be some watered down, sugary mess but it was delicious! And we even got to pick between 4 different types. I think we all got the "remix" one which was blackberry. For the first course we got the empenadas, green chili cornbread, and giant prawns. The cornbread was the favorite I think...it was sooo good, and not just a little slice of bread, it comes in a bowl and is HUGE. For dinner we had the signature pernil asado, chicken breast, and I think it was short rib enchiladas. Each entree came with a choice of TWO sides! Seriously....so much food but it was all soooo good..of course we all got the cheddar/chiptole mashed potatoes that were super spicy but delicious. Key Lime pie won the dessert round for sure. Service was great! Timing between courses was a little quick (overlapped between 1 & 2) but we tried to pace ourselves. Our server was really great in offering his opinions and answering every question. There was also a lot of team work going on which is good to see. All in all this place was AWESOME.  We got THREE meals out of our one (totally sounds like my grandma wrapping her thanksgiving leftovers in foil, but it's true) We will definitely be back, with or without restaurant week.

Had a great experience with Charles! My sister and I went in together for our first go at Botox and it was so much easier than I thought. We had some nerves since it was our first go at it, but Dr.Small made us feel relaxed and comfortable. The space is very pretty and clean (although he mentioned he is moving soon to get some more space!) and the injections were basically pain free and took less than 15 mins. We will definitely be back!

This is by far the best work out studio I've been to! Before this location opened I was going to their studio  in Arcadia and got hooked on the Pilates classes! Pilates was kind of intimidating for me at first because I had no clue what I was doing. After the 1st week I could already see and feel improvements in my body. It's such an awesome workout and it has honestly gotten me into the best shape I've ever been in. The only thing I needed to add to my workout routine was some more cardio so I cannot tell you how happy I was that they opened this second studio and added cycling classes! It's such a great workout and all of the instructors make sure to constantly change up the routine. My favorite class is the 30/30 Reform and Ride....30 mins of Pilates followed by a 30 minute ride! They have a really great schedule and are constantly adding more classes. If you have a membership with Reformed you can jump between their studios to find classes and times that work with any kind of crazy work schedule. The instructors honestly care about every client and make an effort to constantly help you get better. I can't wait to see what else Reformed does in 2015, whatever it is I know will be great!
