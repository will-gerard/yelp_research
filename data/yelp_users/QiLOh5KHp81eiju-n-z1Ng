I write this review as I finish the second of two lime candies that were given to me along with the check. While that part comes last, I feel the need to comment on how good those things are. They are exponentially better than peppermint candies that are ubiquitous at family restaurants.   Anyway, that's probably not why you're here reading this review. Manuel's provided exactly what I was looking for--great Sonoran Mexican food and a down-to-each, low-key atmosphere to go along with it. The experience started off walking into the building, which is located in a strip mall. The building itself seemed to be older than the rest of the mall. Anyway, it worked. The interior is standard 1980s Mexican with the terra cotta tiles all over and sombreros gracing the walls and ceiling. Pretty much sets up the experience the way is should be. Two waiters both tended to the table, answered questions, took part of the order, and continued to serve us through the whole meal. Not only were they both affable, we got twice the attention!  The recommendations they provided were genuine; not limited to "people like this..." No, both waiters told us exactly what they liked and gave reasons. The entrees were preceded by some pretty tasty salsas (yes, two o' them!) and chips and a cheese crisp, which we ordered from the appetizers.  The two of us who dined there had carnitas and the three amigos enchiladas, both which came with rave reviews. If you're not looking for three enchiladas, may I recommend the spinach with white sauce. Neither disappointed. It's true, you need to like cheese and a little grease with you food. But that's exactly why you'd be at this restaurant.

It's a nice airport with just a few caveats: No access direct access between terminals behind security so if you're switching terminals, give yourself enough time. What happened to Terminal 1? Seriously! It's not there. If there's ever a fire in the Terminal 4 baggage claim, it's gonna be a roast. The way the barricades are set up hardly seems conducive to evacuating. Oh, and the baggage claim carousels spin the wrong way; I'm a firm believer they should go clockwise.

Fast and friendly service. Definitely the kind of place I enjoy supporting.

Grimaldi's redeems the coal industry. I know what you're thinking; when I heard they had a coal-fired oven, the first thing that came to mind was dirty coal and the energy industry. Well, I don't know how this oven works but, what I do know is that the pizza that comes out of it is amazing. The crust might be the best of any chain restaurant (sorry, Grimalid's, with as many locations as you've got, you can't deny being a pizza chaing). Don't let the fact that the place is a chain dissuade you from checking it out. The ingredients that grace the crust are phenomenal. Their meats are devine and their veggies crunchy and fresh. Definitely worth trying if you like a good pie.

Their selection of flavors will leave you astounded. Not only is it vast, but the good gelato folks have prepared some enjoyable mixes for the Ammurican customer. Do try their whiskey cream if they have it out.   The gelato may be the best I've had outside of Italy and their cappuccino was done quite nicely.

This In-N-Out is set up just like every other In-N-Out. Walk in and there are you face the counter topped with three cash registered. As you walk forward, the restrooms will be on your right (with the men's on the left and women's on the right should you turn into the alcove) and the seating area will be the entire left of the store. You order, making sure to get a Neapolitan shake with your Double-Double and head to your left to fill up the ketchup tubs (no pickled peppers because this isn't California) before taking a seat on the benches which will be just in front of you. Don't worry about the soda fountain, which will be to your left, along the wall that's adjacent to the drive-thru, as you have a milk shake coming. When they call your order (Number 79, I believe), you go to the counter and find yourself a seat...but you can't have both a window and a booth. Should you want a window seat, you'll have to choose from the hard seats that are set up as two-seater tables, some which are bundled with others. You could eat outside, but this is Arizona, so I wouldn't recommend that. Upon finishing your burger, you should toss the garbage either by the secondary entrance or by the ketchup dispenser.  That is the restaurant layout and your experience, neither of which ever changes.

Sky Harbor is overrun with Burger Kings. Been to a few of them and they're all the same, pretty much. It's just like any other Burger King, which we all know is the king of burgers. But this one is in an airport. That makes it so much more exciting!

As if their breakfast dishes weren't already amazing, they go and have some of the friendliest service! I'd recommend...just about anything!

Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for, but this one is worth skipping. The service I've experienced each time I've been is pretty dang poor and the drinks always seem quite cold.

I said the same thing about Chelsea's Kitchen as I did about its sister restaurant, La Grand Orange, which is located behind security in Terminal D: don't judge this airport establishment by its management. Being in an airport, it's just about guaranteed that HMS will be running the joint. While I don't think they're normally known for their service, the standards for this place have been raised more than a few notches. The restaurant makes a decent place to dine and linger with friends and family before you (or they or all of you) go behind security. The food is high quality and they have a full bar. Top off the experience with free, fresh baked cookies they offer as you depart.

Just about anytime I'm flying on Southwest, I make a point of dining here. Don't judge an airport establishment by its management. When I'm looking for something lighter, I'll go for one of their salads which offer the added benefit of not creating a cloud of odor should you take the leftovers on the plane with you. If the salad is not your thing, try one of their burgers. And make sure you have it served on one of LGO's fresh baked English muffins. The one an only time that I had an issue with the food that had been served, the manager himself brought me the rectified order, apologized for the mistake, and offered me a bakery item. In short, even though this particular LGO is managed by HMS, you can expect the same food that you would expect from La Grand Orange in Pasadena and almost the same level of service.

Snooze nails it on the head with its concept. It's a breakfast joint and focuses solely on that. So much so that it's only open for brunch (until 2:30 for you late risers). While you're still getting caffeinated, their awesome staff is perky and friendly. If you haven't been yet, definitely check it out!
