A great collection of native american artifacts that kept my attention for a couple of hours.  The museum looks very small from the outside, but it sure manages to open up and cram a lot into the space on both of its floors.  I highly recommend checking out the current Geronimo exhibit.  Thanks to Hollywood (which I should know better than to trust for an accurate portrayals of american indians), I always thought he was an apache hero.  Turns out most apache don't like him.  Outside of a history text book, native american culture can be difficult to study.  It also doesn't help that most presentations of american indian history just make me feel guilty about what our government did to their ancestors decades and centuries before my family even immigrated to the country.  While the Herd Museum doesn't completely avoid this feeling, it does try its best not to shove it in your face.  The $15 dollar admission isn't too bad.  Free parking was an unexpected treat.  There are also discounts for seniors, children and students.  Native americans can get in for free, but I think I only remember seeing one native american (an employee) the entire time I was there.

Like pretty much every customer, we were in Bar Bianco while waiting for a seat in Pizzeria Bianco.  Some people view it as a scam, but I see it as a brilliant part of the experience set up by the owner.  You can wait outside in the heat, go somewhere else for a while, or you can chill at a historic house in Heritage Square and have a drink or a small bite.  My fianc√© and I found a little spot at the corner of the bar.  She ordered an organic cider which came in a massive bottle.  For $7 she got two glasses worth of booze.  I'll take that deal.  I tried some organic micro brew beer some oregon (I don't recall the name), which was also delicious.  Prices aren't bad, especially when you consider they can easily gauge all the customers waiting to get into the restaurant.  The selection is fairly limited, but I would even recommend Bar Bianco as a place to spot just have a drink in a cool spot (so long as you have an excuse to be downtown when you do).

Rainbow Donuts is the survivor of a dying breed.  Donuts, coffee and a few other breakfast items.  So simple, so good, and so hard to find.  The only thing this place seems to be missing is a drive through.  But then again, if you're picking up donuts, you can probably use that 10 foot walk from your car to the store.  The donuts are soft, sweet and light. Not too greasy and oily, and not too caky or spongy.  I can eat three or four of Rainbow's Donuts and not get that sick "why did I have so many" feeling.  The donuts are also a little smaller than most places, but they're also cheaper.  The selection is pretty big, and it would be pretty hard to not to find something worth trying.  It's kind of weird that there's quite a few different prices for the types of donuts, but that may save you a few cents in the long run, so I guess it works out.  Rainbow is open everyday from 4am to 7pm.  If you're looking for a treat on your way downtown, it's the perfect place to stop for a few minutes.  The parking lot is very small, but parking isn't very difficult.  Most people don't hang around very long.  It's very quick in and out service.

I cannot profess my love for Oregano's enough. It's the closest thing to the stuffed and thin crust pizzas I grew up eating in Chicago that you can get in the Valley. The sauce is perfect,, the toppings and cheese are wonderful, and the dough is excellent.   I don't typically find myself at the Camelback location since I live close to old town Scottsdale.  But yesterday I had a craving and decided to order from there and pick it up on my way to work (this location is much closer to there). Had an 8" Sprocolli which I nearly finished off myself when I made it to work.   The only thing I am disappointed in was the wait. I got to the restaurant and went to the pickup area. I guess one of the customers ahead of me had some sort of an issue, because it took a lot longer than I expected to pick up the pizza. But the staff was so friendly when I finally made it to the register, that I couldn't even hold it against them.

Being a Chicago guy, I can't say enough about how much I enjoy an Italian Beef Sandwich from Lukes. They're exactly like what I used to eat growing up. Put the peppers on them if you know how to eat one right.   The place is as Chicago as it gets. If you order a hot dog with everything on it, they don't include ketchup unless you specifically ask. Their supplier is Vienna Beef, and they even have the neon green relish. The fries are even the exact the same as the Chicago locations.   The place is also very Chicago themed. Pictures and posters of the Windy City and its sports teams surround you. And if stop by during a Cubs game, rest assured it will be playing on the TV.   The prices are the one big negative that keeps me from driving over to Luke's more often. Although the food tastes great, and is worth the value for an occasional trip, it's a lot of money for greasy fast food.  But if you're looking for an authentic Chicago hot dog or Italian Beef in Phoenix, hit up Luke's.

Like most Einstein locations, I'm unimpressed with the way the business is run.  The bagels aren't  bad, but they're not worth the aggravation it takes to obtain one.  The line was crazy long on a Wednesday morning at 8:30am, there already was a severe shortage in options because several bagels and pastries were already sold out, and after ordering you continue to wait in line just to pay.  There are some pluses.  This location has plenty of seating (however, most of it is outside on a shared patio with Starbucks and a sandwich shop).  It's a short walk from the Camelback automile, which makes it one of the best places to grab something to eat if you're getting your car serviced around breakfast or lunchtime.  It's also open until 5pm which is actually pretty late for an Einstein.  Judging by the fact that I've reviewed three Einstein locations, and given all of them just two stars, I'm guess that most of the problems come down from the corporate level.  However, each location seems to always have a steady flow of customers, so why should they work to improve the massive flaws?

I love the Apple Store.  Great products.  Great customer service.  And just an overall cool presentation.  I bought just bought my first Mac here.  Great experience.  It was like buying a car without the headaches.  I was shown how to set it up and given a quick tutorial.  No charge.  I can also go to any store, any time, if I have more questions, and I won't have to worry about getting an employee who isn't knowledgeable.  This location is not quite as sleek and cool as many of the others.  It's a lot older (I believe this one was the first in the valley) and feels a little more dated than most.  It's also a lot smaller and has a lot less employees.  The good news, there's also a lot less customers inside.  So while it doesn't have the pulse of most Apple stores, it also doesn't feel like a cluster some others do.

Chipotle is probably my favorite fast foot chain. The food is always high quality even if it's obviously a lot higher in sodium and calories than they'd like to admit. Everything tastes good and fresh. If you go at a busy time, it also feels like the line always moves fast, too.   But there's too big things that keep me from giving it five stars. The first was raising their already high prices last year. I don't like that I can buy a Burrito at a sit-down restaurant for nearly the same price.  The other is how they charge you for everything. Not only are items like chips and guacamole extra, but they come in huge sizes. If you're going to charge me for a big scoop of guacamole, at least offer me a half size for cheaper.

I think I want to get my hair cut here. The kids get to sit in a car and watch a DVD or play video games while they get a haircut. I'll take that over feeling forced to make small talk. There's also plenty of junk to distract the kids in the waiting area. Unless your children are deathly afraid of getting a hair cut, I can't think of reason they won't enjoy coming to this place.  At just 7 months old my daughter's hair is already out of control. She was born with a lot of hair. She may not necessarily have enough to warrant a full haircut, but neither my wife or I have the chutzpah to hold a pair of scissors anywhere near her head. On a recommendation, we took her to Cool Cuts 4 Kids. She had a great time. She sat in a firetruck and played with the steering while while watching some Minnie Mouse cartoon. She didn't fuse at all during the experience. They also give a cute little first hair package, which includes certificate and a baggie with the hair. She'll be back here soon.

It turns out not all LA Fitnesses are cut from the same mold.  Not only is the the equipment here not old and worn, but unlike the other locations there's plenty of machines and benches to support the crowd.  The cardio machines have personal tv/mp3 players.  And to make things even better, there's lots of space.  Cardio and weights are two completely separate areas.  The cycle room has more bikes than other club I've been in and the group fitness room is huge.  Why can't the other locations be like this?

You may be able to find better deals at craft stores, but what you'll find at Aaron Brothers are people who really know what they're doing.  The selection is also much better and the work is done meticulously.  Plus, they do send out coupons every now and then, and when that happens you really can score an amazing deal.  We had our Katubah framed (for the many non-jewish readers; it's a very artful jewish marriage license).  At 23" by 23", a custom job was the only way to have it framed.  Not only did Aaron brothers do a great job framing it, but they used a temporary back so we could take it out of the frame, sign it on our wedding day, and bring it back afterwards to finish the job at no extra charge.   When originally pricing the frames, the sales people told my fianc√© that if she signed up for their email list, she would get a 60% coupon.  So they waited on making an immediate sale and instead let the customer know that she could get a better price if she waited a few weeks.  Mad props on that.  My only negative comment.  The Katubah looks so good in its frame that we want to hang it now.

You know all the stereotypes you have about Walmart?  This location reaffirms all of them.  I'm glad to see it's being renovated.  Until that's complete, I recommend staying as far away from this Walmart as possible.

I enjoy going to Tatum Dental Care. At least as much as one can enjoy going to a dentist.  It's a nice little office with a great staff. I think I've been seen by every hygienist in the practice and each of them does a great job. My teeth and gums always feel great after a cleaning. No pain. I also love that they have a monitor with DirecTV that hangs over the chairs. Watching SportsCenter really does take away some of the awkwardness of having someone poke and prod in your mouth.  There are only two things that bug me about the office. 1. The rooms aren't completely private. There's a small wall but no doors separating each room. It's not bad, but you can really hear when someone is getting work done. That drilling sound is just never pleasant. 2. The little fountain in the waiting room. I'm sure a lot of people find the decoration soothing. I personally think it's kind of annoying.  Two small gripes aside; this is definitely a dentist worth seeing if you happening to live in this part of town.

The customer service at this Discount Tire Company is second to none.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  The shop wasn't very busy when I pulled up, and one of the guys walked up to greet me at my vehicle.  An unnecessary, but very appreciated gesture.  My fianc√©'s Jeep had her tires replaced at this location earlier in the year.  Recently, the tire pressure light kept coming on even after the tires were filled.  Since I had the day off, I took it back to have Discount Tire check out the tires, and see if there was a slow leak or any other flaw.  The tires had been filled this morning, so the light was off.  They tested and inspected them but couldn't find anything.  The mechanic mounted them slightly higher than usual, and told me to bring the suv back if it happened again.  Not only was this free of charge and done in less than a half hour, but they also didn't treat me like I was an idiot wasting their time.  When we had the tires replaced earlier this year, it was also cheap and quick.  I'm definitely taking my car here when its tires go.

A few weeks after I became a homeowner, a friend of mine asked my how many Home Depot runs have I made.  What a great question.  The answer:  Way too many.  Since I purchased my house, I have had countless projects and little tasks I've needed to take care of.  This store gets most of my business since it's the closest hardware store to desert ridge.  And I'm glad it is.  It's a great place to shop.  There's always a free employee wondering around that will drop whatever he or she is doing to help me out.  They always tell me that the more expensive item is better, but show me the cheaper items that meet my needs (and that's the one I almost always walk away with).  They also know how to translate my 'I don't really know the proper way to tell you what I need, because I'm a novice at all this stuff' speak, and make sure that I leave with the right materials that I need to get my job done.

I wish I hadn't grown up. Because when I did... I went to this store which made regret ever being a Toys R Kid.  This Toys R Us could be used as the very reason why I do most of my shopping online.  The store is big and may have a huge selection, but it's woefully messy and unorganized.  And by messy I don't just mean stuff all over the place, I'm talking about dirty with cracked floor titles that are big enough to be tripped over.  I would say the store was hit by Grey Thursday/Black Friday tornado and never recovered, but it feels like it's always this way.  And it didn't take me too long to come to that conclusion.  That's because with the exception of the cashiers, I only saw three employees on the floor.  I know it was only friday in the mid-afternoon, but It's the holiday season.  How are there only three people available to help customers, restock shelves, and do any general cleaning in a store this big?  Unless you have a child with you, I would avoid entering this Toys R Us at all cost.  Actually, for their safety, I would avoid bringing a child into this store, too.

One of the best decisions my wife and I made as new parents was taking our daughter to the baby splash class at Hubbard Family Swim School. From ages 2 to 5 months, you can bring your baby to a free weekly swim class. It's probably more for you than for them at first. The baby gets the early experience of being in the water. The parent gains of confidence of being able to properly hold and play with their child when they take them into the water. My daughter not only took to it pretty quickly, but going to Hubbard on Wednesday afternoons probably became the highlight of our week during the three month session.  The instructors were awesome and we were never pressured into signing up for paid classes. The social aspect (with the exception of a couple of times where we were the only ones who showed up) is also quite fun. It was nice to meet other parents with children that were my daughter's age. It's always warm in the pool area, and there is a separate pool for the babies with water that is kept to a pretty high temperature. Just do your best to make sure your child (and you) don't swallow the water. Just trust me on that one.  While we didn't sign up for more lessons (I have a backyard pool that we spent a lot of time in over the summer), I definitely credit Hubbard with why my child's love for the bath and pool, and pretty much everything else that involves water. She even enjoys being dunked and having water poured over her head. How many people can saw that about their baby?  Now that the weather is cooling off, and I'd love it if my daughter could start learning the actual fundamentals of swimming (at least for safety), more classes could be in order.

Being stuck in terminal 3 is an awful experience.  If it weren't for my notebook and the free WiFi, I'd be screwed.  There's only a Starbucks, a Wendy's, and Blue Burrito as eating options.  There's also a bar which is average at best for an airport bar.  There's a few more selections back before security, but I really don't have the desire to go through security again when I need to go back.  Especially since they had to test my TSA Approved bottle of contact lense solution.  The only other saving grace is the fact that I'm not stuck in terminal 2.  When at Sky Harbor, try to fly an airline that goes through Terminal 4.

This is a great place to hike in the valley! There are so many different trails here that very in length and challenge. Yesterday, a friend of mine and I took advantage of the beautiful weather and went up an unmarked area of the mountain. It was pretty much straight up, and my legs still are hurting, but it was totaly worth it.  I honestly don't know where exactly we were, but when we reached summit there was an awesome rock formation at the top, and an excellent view of nearly the entire valley!

Shopping at this store is like being in an abusive relationship.  I know I should stay away, but I continue to think that things will magically change.  The extremely close proximity to my house is what keeps me coming back.  But the more I shop at this Albertsons, the more I despise it.  The store is always running out of the items that are on sale.  Many products on the shelves are extremely close to their pull dates.  I've even seen items on the shelves that are well past their expiration dates.  The produce rarely looks fresh and the meat and poultry never looks like it's great quality.  Albertsons staff is very friendly, but it doesn't really help when most of the time, they end what they're saying with "I'm sorry."

If you're a guy, don't even bother walking through the doors.  It feels like the men's department is just set up as a courtesy.  The reviewer who says the women's to men's ratio is 4:1 is being pretty generous.  Ladies; if you have the patience to sift through several aisles of unorganized stuff, you may find a good deal on something fashionable.  But if you succeed on your quest to actually find what you're looking for, you'll also need to have the patience to sit in an unnecessarily long check out line.  There are other discounter clothing stores in Desert Ridge.  I can only recommend Ross as a desperate last resort.

A long line at an Einstein is to be expected on a Saturday morning.  But a more than 15 wait for two toasted bagels with smear is not.  That, by the way, was after a five minute wait just to order and pay.  I know that the biggest part of this issue is that a chain like Einstein has set ways of doing things, but it would've been nice to see some of the workers have a little more urgency to get food out.  It was so backed up that there was barely a place to stand and wait at 8:00am.  I don't even want to know what it may have looked like at 9:00 or 10:00.

Other than perhaps the Cine Capri, this theater doesn't really offer anything that you can't find at any other Harkins.  Having said that; If you're going to head out to the movies, there's no reason to pass over this theater.  it's a big, clean multiplex, which attracts a big crowd, but manages to never really feel too packed.  The auditoriums have stadium seating, plus good picture quality and a nice sound system.  Enjoy your show!

When the pregnant wife wants a smoothie, she's getting a smoothie.  I can't say that I'm all that familiar with smoothie shops around the valley, so I checked out the Yelp app, and found Paradise Juice.  It wasn't the closest place, but when 50+ reviewers give it a 4.5 star average, we decided we should drive the extra mile or two to give it a try.  We're happy we did.  What really sticks out about the smoothies at Paradise Juice is that they're actually smooth.  A lot of places I've been too either blend them down to a juice or make them way too icy like a slurpee.  At Paradise Juice, the smoothie actually tastes like thick fruit, yogurt, and juice.  If there were any artificial ingredients in this drink, I sure couldn't tell.

The Beer is good, most of the food is ok, but I have a big issue with BJ's.  They advertise their pizza as Chicago style deep dish.  When you order one, you'll know right away why there isn't a single location of this chain in Illinois.  The Pizza is more like something I'd expect to have ordered at Pizza Hut than anything I've had growing up in Chicago.  Have a beer here before seeing a movie next door.  Other than that, there's way better places to eat in and around Chandler Fashion Center Mall.

I've already expressed my love for Chompies in my review of the Tempe location, but after having brunch at this location this morning, I need to do the same for Scottsdale.   I'm not usually a fan of big menus. But since pretty much everything at Chompies is good, let them cook whatever they want. I met a friend here at 11am and had some trouble deciding between breakfast or lunch. As I looked through the menu, the omelets caught my eye. I had the Spanish Omelet which has black beans, onions, tomato, cheddar and jalapeno jack cheese. It also comes with potatoes and a bagel or toast for $8.50. Not only Delicious, but I'm set for the day.

In a serendipitous moment, I discovered Sun Devil Auto.  My wife's Jeep needed an oil change.  She didn't care where it was taken, she just wanted to get it done and not miss time at work or kill a couple hours over the weekend.  I had some free time, and decided I'd go to the nearest Jiffy Lube.  It was 7:30am, and I guess I was a little tired when I parked the Jeep and accidentally walked into the Sun Devil Auto next door to the Jiffy Lube I was planning to get an oil change at.  It turns out an oil change and inspection at Sun Devil is just $20.  That's not a type-o.  The only catch, Sun Devil only takes oil changes by appointment.  I literally had all day, but fortunately they were able to see me at 9am.  I killed an hour, took the Jeep back, and about another hour later it was ready to go.  I got a list of recommended services for my next visit, but never got the dreaded listing of extras that I supposedly needed before this visit was over.  How fortuitous that I ended walking 20 feet to the left instead of the right.  $20 without any sort of a coupon for an oil change.  I'm good with that.

I've never been to Paris.  But if this is just a fraction of what an actual french bistro is like, then sign me up for a trip.  My girlfriend and I enjoyed a very pleasurable Valentine's Day meal together at Zinc.  We actually went out on the night before Valentine's day because we have odd schedules and we wanted to avoid the crowds.  But as you can imagine, a highly regarded french restaurant was still fairly slammed.  The dining room was packed and it was very noisy.  I don't know if there is anything they could do about the acoustics, but it was awfully tough for me to hear our waitress at times.  It also is pretty dark inside.  Not quite as bad as a couple of Yelpers have complained about, but I could image why it may be too dark for some.  The french onion soup was a reputation for being superb.  I'll agree that it's excellent.  Not the best.  But you won't regret ordering it. I had the seared ahi, which was awesome.  Not only was the fish cooked perfectly, and the thinly shaved ham, crab, and potatoes compliment the tuna quite well, but the presentation of the dish was a work of art.  It was almost a shame to eat it.  My girlfriend tried the short ribs.  Zinc continues to prove my theory that there's no such thing as bad short ribs.  The bread that's served with the meal is also great.  It has that burnt bottom crust that just tells you it was made right.  When we ordered our meals, the waitress advised us to give her a heads up early if we wanted the chocolate souffle (like any good souflle, it takes a half hour to bake).  Yes, please!  And we were sure glad we did.  Both of us were quite stuffed when it arrived, but that didn't stop us from devouring it.  It was light and sweet and the chocolate sauce was to die for.

I don't think there's such thing as a dry cleaners that I love.  There are many that are good (or at least adequate) and I will repeatedly give them business.  There are several that I hate and would never use again.  Monte Carlo Cleaners is certainly the former.  I've been using this dry cleaner on and off for years.  Originally because I used to work on a TV show that was taped at a now closed restaurant in the Promenade, and now because I currently live just a couple of miles away.  No problems to report.  Monte Carlo has never lost or ruined a garment, and anytime I've showed them a stain, it was cleanly removed.  The price is on par with most dry cleaners in the valley.  It's actually very good when compared to much of the competition in the immediate area.  It's a little annoying that they don't take credit cards, but that seems to be a very common trend in the dry cleaning business.

This is the perfect spot for a date night.   For about the same price as seeing a movie in regular theaters, you can check out a second-run in a very cozy setting. It kind of feels like you're watching a movie in a very nice theater room at a friend's house (only the movie is still off a film projector, and the sound system is better). The seats are very comfortable and are easy to transition from the table (when you're eating) to facing the screen better when you're not. The staff is also very good about being almost transparent while serving you in the middle of the movie.   The food is not spectacular, but it's definitely not bad. They also have a decent beer and wine selection, along with a bar in the lobby.   If you've never tried a cinema supper club, Farrelli's is worth checking out just for the experience alone. Or if you're just planning to do dinner and a movie on a random night, why not just do them both together?

Arrivederci is one of those little nice family owned restaurants that people keep kvetching the valley doesn't have enough of.  While it's not the best Italian food in Scottsdale, it serves up some wonderful meals at reasonable prices.  For me, it brings back memories of many little whole-in-the-wall Italian restaurants my family and I used to visit when I was growing up in Chicago and Cleveland.  As others have said, the decor is awful but easy to look past.  The "rustic" wall paper and wine racks probably had an authentic old school feeling 20 years ago, but the dining room could drastically use a 21st century update.  The Ferrari parked outside is cool for a quick glance, but really just serves as a fairly pointless "wow" device.  The food tastes fresh, the sauces are good but not overpowering to the dishes, and the service is great.  The only thing I don't recommend is the complimentary liquor shots we received at the end of our meal.  Awful.  The server said it would help with digestion.  It left me feeling like I was suffering from indigestion.

A Sushi bar that's all about substance and not flash! Hiro doesn't waste its space with a dark or flashy ambiance. It's a tiny restaurant with its Sushi bar on one side, and around a dozen tables on the other. You won't find the loud music and the Old Town crowd at this place. Instead, you'll find some of the best rolls in Arizona.   We had orders of Spicy Tuna Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll, and asked them to make a Salmon and Avocado Roll (a great call by my girlfriend), and a small bottle of Saki. Hiro has a pretty good selection of Saki, not just the cheapest stuff to heat up for a Bomber. All three rolls may be simple, but with full confidence I can say they were better than all of the more popular Sushi bars.   The staff is also very friendly. As we got up to leave we got a "goodbye" and "Thank you" from the server, all the chefs at the Sushi bar, and the hostess. As much as I enjoy the "scenery" at the flashy Scottsdale Sushi bars. I'm not going complain that I got to enjoy Sushi without them. If you're looking for great rolls, head to Hiro.

This is my favorite bagel shop in the valley. Everything here is good! The prices are just a little more than what you're going to a chain bagel shop (but I'd rather pay a little more to be supporting a local establishment anyway... especially when the food is better). Plus there's some humorous jewish bumperstickers taped under the menu board.  Not only do I aprecciate it as a jew, but who else would you trust to run a bagel shop?  They have a great variety of bagels, and a decent variety of coffee flavors. I can't comment on the other food and drinks they have there, but if it's half as good as a bagel and cream cheese, then it's got to be great.   The only negative is the parking. The shopping center Lox Stock & Bagel is located in is way too small compared to the shopping (and gym) space. You'll always find a spot that is a short walk away, so it's not too bad. It's just annoying that it's always hard to find a close spot.

I took the morning spin class at the LA Fitness in the same shopping center as Lox Stock & Bagel. I then decided to ruin that workout with a bagel and cream cheese. I'm not disappointed with my choice.   I tried a spinach and Pesto bagel with plain cream cheese. It's just as good as everything else I've ever tried from Lox Stock & Bagel. And I had to have their Jazzy Java. It's the greatest coffee in the valley. And even better; I just learned today that Lox Stock & Bagel sells bags of the grinded beans!

A Bagel Card!  Every seventh bagel and cream cheese free!  I didn't really need an excuse to get the best bagel I've ever had west of the Mississippi, but it doesn't hurt to have one!

There really isn't anything all that special about this safeway compared to the others in the valley.  It's spacous and clean, and carries generally the same items at the same prices.  As another Yelper pointed out, the Beer and Wine selection is more upscale.  there are two things that I really like about this location which I would like to share:  1. Self-check out I know some people hate it.  But I'm a fan.  I hate waiting in line.  If I'm buying just one or two items, I'd much rather scan and pay myself as quickly as possible.  2. Not too crowded If there is a crowd here, I've never really noticed it.  It's always easy to find an employee who's free to help you.  And if I don't use the self-check out, the line at the registers have never been too long.  This location does suffer from my usual Safeway complaint.  Can the employees stop looking at the name on the recept from the safeway card?  I understand the theory behind this policy, but my phone number on file is an old one, and comes up as someone else.  They always try to call me by his appearently hard to pronounce name.  My girlfriend has also scanned her card before, then I have paid. Men just love it when they're called Mr. [her last name].  I almost always pay by credit.  Try looking at that name, please.

If the food weren't so good, this Chipotle would represent my idea of one of the nine circles of Hell.  Enter on the wrong weekday evening during peak dinner hours, and you will feel like you're stuck in the middle of a daycare center.  Little kids run around as if they're in a McDonald's Play Place, but since there is no play area, they're just running around the restaurant.  If you're picking up food at this time, do yourself a huge favor and order it online to-go.  The 27 minute line (I'm not exaggerating; I timed it on my cellphone) is to be expected at 6:30 on a Wednesday night, but the crammed crowd and noise was pretty hard to bare.  Parking is also a regular pain at this shopping center.  I am not a kid hater.  I also understand that these issues are not entirely Chipotle's fault (which is why the place still gets four stars).  It's the parents job to keep their kids in line and it would be a PR nightmare for any company to try to do something about it.  But if you perfer to be in an environment without children running around like it's recess, then you may want to give another location a try.  There's quite a few other Chipotles just a couple of miles away.  The saving grace is my love for Chipotle's food.  It's the one fast-food option my girlfriend and I regularly agree on when we're too lazy to cook and not in the mood to dine out.  Everything is fresh and tasty.  The extra charge for stuff like guacamole is annoying.  But Chipotle delivers great food at a good price, so I'm more than willing to put up with the headaches to get my delicious burrito.

There's a reason why on a Friday night several pizza places down the street have an obnoxiously long wait at 6:00pm and why Nello's only has a handful of diners.  It's just not what it once was.  My wife and I split a small caesar salad ($8.99).  It was pretty good and would have feed at least 3, maybe even four people.  However, there was a mysterious scary looking piece of mushroom in the salad.  While the random fungi wasn't something worth sending it back over.  It made me wonder what other things could have fallen into the wrong place in the kitchen.  We also split a 14" pesto chicken pizza ($20.49).  The parts of the pie that weren't burnt were pretty good.  Again, we could have complained, but why wait another 10 to 15 minutes for another pizza.  The good news for us, thanks to a $30 for $15 gift certificate on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485), we didn't pay too much.

What a difference a year makes. While we weren't impressed with our previous experience at Nello's, my very pregnant wife heard a rumor that the house salad dressing has the right combinations of spices that are actually known to put women into labor. The restaurant is aware of this rumor, the manager says she's been told several times that it does the trick, but spoiler alert... it did not do it for my wife. However; the house salad dressing (and the garden salad) is awesome.  The waiter also recommended the buffalo wings with Nello's own sauce. The sauce is just a tad spicy (another alleged labor inducer), but not hot enough to ward off those who don't like hot flavors. Even after eating an obnoxious amount of food, I had to finish off the plate, the wings were that delicious. We also split a chicken parmigiana sandwich which was quite good.  Oddly enough, skipping out on what Nello's is known for, the pizza, really changed our perception of the place. Nello's still has a $30 for $15 gift certificate on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) which is always a great way to save cash on the meal. We're looking forward to our next trip. Which will most likely be with the baby that the salad dressing did not help come out already.

It's one of the Sprint Stores that has technicians on site when your phone is having a problem.  That's nice.  Too bad every time you see a technician at a Sprint Store, they seem to always have the same solution.  Reboot the phone.  It's like a bad IT department.  I lost my phone for 90 minutes to do something I could've done on my own.  The technician was kind enough to backup my contacts on the memory card, but didn't take the time to put them back on the phone.  It actually appears the problem was my charger, not the phone, so was the reboot even necessary?  Also, If you don't have Sprint's insurance, you may have to pay for any repairs even if the phone is under warranty.  You have to deal with the manufacturer if it's under warranty.  Thanks for standing by your products, Sprint.

Prices are good for the area.  I paid about $300 a month (with tax and the cheapest insurance) for a 20 x 10 climate controlled storage unit on the ground floor.  Checking in and out was very simple.  The staff is also very friendly.  It really feels like they'll do just about anything to help you out.  The day after I reserved my unit online, I got a call from the manager to confirm the reservation and see if I had any questions.  On my first day, my gate code wasn't working, so she gave me a generic one until the problem could be sorted out.  I was given a working code by the end of the day.  The only negative about the office is there only seems to be one employee working at a time, so you may have to wait.  It also closes in the early afternoon so that employee can go to lunch.  Moving in and out is also pretty easy.  There's also a couple of flat dollies left around to help you out, but I recommend bringing your own, they seem to disappear once in a while, even if you're the only person on the premises.  The only thing I don't get is the hours.  The storage area is accessible from 6am to 9pm.  The office is only open from 9:30am to 6pm.  If there are going to be so many hours with no on site staffing, why not just be accessible 24-7?  Then again, what would someone be doing at a storage unit overnight?

Irving Goldenberg and his team made our car purchasing experience as smooth as possible. Between my wife and I, we have bought a lot of cars - and we have never had such pleasurable customer service.  Irving found us the perfect vehicle and was very knowledgeable. He was able to answer every question and was a wealth of knowledge and a great resource. We left with the perfect new car for our family.  We chose to finance our new car - and the finance experience was also very smooth and simple. I went to clean out the old car and Susan and my wife were finished signing the papers before I could empty the trunk! Susan explained all the numbers and my wife didn't even have any questions (and trust me, she always has something to say!) - she was very thorough. Thanks, Susan!  Everything was taken care of for us and we really appreciate the hard work on the Schumacher team. Look no further for your car-buying needs - stop in and see Irving (and tell him I sent you!).

This is by far the best Micro Brewery in the valley.  I doubt I'll every find a better beer.  All of their brews are fantastic, you can't go wrong with the Four Peaks selection.  Last night, we had a pitcher of the RJA IPA, which was wonderful, but for any first timers, I highly recommend the Kilt Lifter. The food is also top notch.  I've never had anything on menu that I didn't enjoy.  I also enjoyed that it wasn't very crowded.  I went on Saturday night at 7:15, just as the ASU game was about to kick off.  The place had a good crowd, but it wasn't packed.  The Tempe location is probably better overall.  But this is a very close second (and the parking isn't as big of a pain).

A nice little spot where you can get a really good bagel.  While it's not the best that I've had in the valley, Big City Bagels is certainly better than any of the chain Bagel places.  Prices are really low, especially when you consider the area Big City Bagels is located.  I'll take $2.50 for a bagel with cream cheese anytime.  BCB also offers a good list of other breakfast food, sandwiches, and a decent variety of coffees.   It's a little bit hidden in that massive shopping center at Hayden and Frank Lloyd Wright, by Four Peaks.  But when you find it, Big City Bagels is definitely worth skipping your usual chain bagel shop for.

Love the food.  Hate the location.  Driving around this shopping complex can be a headache at anytime.  And to make it worse there's very limited parking near Wildflower, so if you don't park close you could have a long walk across a very busy parking lot.  Not a very smart or safe situation.  The small amount of spots located near the restaurant (and the couple of shops around it) are also hard to pull in and out of.  All the food I've tried from Wildflower is delicious.  There's a unique twist to all of the sandwiches and salads.  Just don't lie to yourself that it's healthy.  Like most other sandwich shops, everything is packed with a high fat and/or calorie count.  Especially the salads.  I've never tried any of the baked goods; they just never look like they're worth it.

I've got to give mad props to any business that really checks up on it's Yelp reviews!  While I gave Wildflower a positive four star review, I did point out a few things about the location and restaurant that I did not like.  Wildflower's founder, Louis, contacted me to tell me that he agrees with my assessment of the parking situation outside the restaurant, and to show me where customers could find nutritional information and ways to order their meals to fit their dietary needs.  While stopping in for a soup and half sandwich order for lunch, I decided to try a baked good on this visit.  It was just a chocolate chip cookie, nothing crazy, but I've got to say it was a very tasty cookie.  Perhaps a scone or muffin will be in order next time I drive by.

Pinnacle Peak Patio is far from a top dining spot in Phoenix.  It is a very touristy spot that overplays its cowboy/western theme.  The place hasn't changed much (if at all) since the first time I was there about 20 years ago.  The menu is pretty basic, offering mostly above average chicken, ribs, steaks and burgers.  And it may even be a bit over priced.  Having said that;  Pinnacle Peak Patio is still a fun spot to grab a good bite to eat.  It's definitely one of those places that you need to bring the family to at least once.  Enjoy the old west town ambiance, bring the kids, and don't wear a necktie unless you want part of it to be added to their collection.

The decision on the DJ for our wedding was made the moment we met with Jeff from Ray the DJ.  He is older for a man of his profession (not a kid in his 20's that you'd expect to be working as a party/event DJ) but it didn't take long for him to win us over.  The man is all charm and character.  We could tell that he really loved music and what he does.  I almost wanted to pull him out from behind the turntables, sit down, and have a few drinks with him.   He couldn't have been any better at the reception.  He played everything we asked for, flowed perfectly with our timeline (including working with us to finish some schmoozing before moving on to the next part), He could get our guest's attention but never tried to make himself the star of the show, and he knew how to keep the party going.  The only negative thing I can say about Jeff was that he took an awful request from my new sister in law (but in all fairness to him, she wanted to dance with her husband to their wedding song, so I can't blame him), but he quickly recovered as soon as the track ended.  Probably with the exception of that song, people were on the dance floor until the final song.

Just awful customer service.  Like most people in the valley, I'm stuck with US Airways because they're the hometown carrier.  And after my recent experience with the airline's customer service, I mean it when I say I will do my best to avoid US Airways whenever I can.  My girlfriend and I had a 2:50pm flight to Minneapolis booked for Friday, September, 16th for a wedding.  On Sunday, September 11th, a friend of ours (who was going to be in the wedding in Minnesota) was killed in a hit-and-run.  The funeral ended up being Friday at 11:00am.  With all the fees associated with changing our flight US Airways wanted nearly $650.00 dollars to change our outbound tickets.  That's more than I paid for the round trip!  It's also way inflated compared to what they were asking for the one ticket to Minneapolis at the later time.  We asked if we could just skip our flight and book the later ticket.  The agents said we would lose our return ticket if we didn't pay a $150 reissuing fee.  They said they would waive the fees for people who could prove they were family.  The only way to do that was to get a copy of the death certificate, and happen to have the same last name as the deceased.  Even if I were family, how could you expect people to ask a mourning father for a copy of the death certificate because his son's horrific death was at a very inconvenient time?  I know many other airlines can be just as difficult, but I never knew one could go so far out of its way to make things so difficult for bereaved customers.

An excellent little breakfast and lunch spot in downtown Phoenix. Just the pita bread alone is worth it. It's the best I've had. No need for anything to dip it in, I would almost feel guilty if added any more flavor to the party.   I stopped in Crazy Jim's this morning desperately needing to fill my stomach with some much needed breakfast. I ordered up a Gyro Omelet to go. How awesome is that! And it's only $3.75.  While the presentation of the omelet itself wasn't much to look at, the eggs, feta, onion, tomato, and Gyro meat all go together perfectly. The hash browns were an okay side, but nothing special. The bread, as I already stated, was phenomenal.   I've been in Crazy Jim's a couple other times. The prices for lunch are quite high, but the food is really good. As one of my coworkers puts it; Crazy Jim's has the best salads, but it's only something you can afford on payday.  This is the perfect place to treat yourself once in a while if you work downtown.

If you're in downtown Phoenix during breakfast and lunch hours, and you're looking for quick, good and cheap meal, then Sticklers is the place to go.   I'm normally a pack a lunch person, but I forgot to restock on groceries and needed something to keep me going until I leave work at 12:30. I went with a Bagel Egg Sandwich. It's exactly what it sounds like, eggs, ham or bacon, and cheese on a bagel. Although I was disappointed to see the guy making my food using a microwave for the scrambled eggs, it's still pretty good, plus it's big and filling for just $4.25. Overall, the food is very cheap at Sticklers. The most expensive thing on the menu is large salad for $6.50.   The place is really big for a quick service breakfast and lunch spot. There's a lot of room inside, and plenty of seating on a back patio and in front of the restaurant. Although the place does tend to fill up during peak lunch hours.   The only thing I don't like about Sticklers is that it opens at 6:00am and only serves breakfast until 10:30. Other than the eggs, nothing on the breakfast menu requires any form of cooking. It's mostly bagels, muffins, and yogurt. They might as well just keep a bigger stock of those foods and keep serving them all the way up until they close at 4:00pm.

A cool little outdoor mall filled with several quality restaurants and upscale shops.  It's well designed to mostly attract the well off folks who live in the immediate area, or are staying in the nearby resorts.  Having several grassy areas not only adds to the attractiveness of Biltmore Fashion Park's design, but also makes it a dog and kid friendly spot.  There's actually a park feeling to it, so unlike some spots in the valley, the word "park" in the name actually makes sense.  Other than some of the restaurants, Biltmore Fashion Park isn't really a good destination place if you live far.  The stores aren't really anything you can't find find at most other valley malls and shopping centers.  Many of those stores also tend to close fairly early.  I usually only shop at the Biltmore if I'm planning to eat there, too.  The parking situation is also a little odd.  The front of the mall (uncovered) charges hourly, but can be validated.  Many of the restaurants in the front also offer free valet.  The parking structure located in the rear of the mall is free.  In the hot Arizona summer, I'd assume it would make more sense to charge people to use the covered parking.  Uncovered spots in the back of mall are also free of charge.

The food is good and the location is perfect. A solid breakfast spot in Oldtown. Everything on the menu looks fantastic. I went the healthy route this morning and went with the Quick Start Conscious. 4 egg whites, broccoli, tomato, fruit and cottage cheese. Phenomenal for a healthy breakfast out.   Breakfast club also brews a pretty solid cup of coffee that gives me a pretty good buzz for only having two cups.  The only real negative is the outside seating. It seemed good in theory on a cool day in Scottsdale with temperatures only in the seventies. However, being right on Scottsdale Road, it was hard to hear the people I was eating with because of all the passing traffic. I'd advise that anyone dining here eat inside (where it unfortunately can also be a little loud since the place is always busy).

It's hard to judge a comedy club because you're really there for the act. But the Comedy Spot is a fun little place to see a show. The people who perform there may not be as well known as the comedians at the Improv, but if you're into stand up comedy, you'll recognize many of the names.   The venue itself is small which actually adds to the experience. Every table is close to the stage. And on the night I was there, it spelled trouble for most of the people up front. The comics have no trouble spoting them, and they did a great job ripping into random people. Make sure you purchase your tickets in advance, because there aren't very many seats.   The two drink minimum is the norm for comedy clubs, so I can't complain. The prices aren't any worse than what you'd expect at a club. Again, the overall experience mostly depends on the act. But I would never complain about going to a show here.

My friends and I stopped here for a drink before meeting for a big dinner next door. The whole theme of Kazimierz is pretty cool. It's supposed to be like a 1920's speakeasy, and it pulls it off quite well. The windows are all painted over and the entrance is in the back. The decor also gives off a fun and fancy vibe.   Kazimierz has a huge selection of wines. It's pretty hard to pick a glass or bottle. The place also has a good beer and vodka selection. It's a real good spot to start or end the night if you're out in old town.

A french-themed restaurant with some wild west inspiration. Nothing says classy Arizona like this!  Cowboy Ciao was recommend to me a couple years ago, but I never got around to eating there until last Friday night.  I now regret that I waited so long. It's another one of the valley's locally owned hidden gems.   Cowboy Ciao has a small, but very tempting menu. Everything on it looks fantastic. Our waiter gave a couple of recommendations. We went with some of them, and were not disappointed. The place also has a massive wine selection (doesn't hurt that they own the wine bar next door).   For an appetizer, we split the Short Rib Risotto. I could've enjoyed this as my meal. For an entree, we split a pan-seared panko-crusted halibut. It was served with sweet potatoes and a cucumber coleslaw that was almost as good as the fish. I highly recommend it.   A piece of advise. Cowboy Ciao calls its entrees "big plates," and they're not kidding. The portion sizes are huge.  I recommend sharing.

It's a great little optometrist office. The only reason I went there the first time was because it was the closest eye doctor's office to me that accepted my insurance. I'm glad they do.  I'm always looking for a new doctor, I'm not too thrilled with my dentist, but I'll always recommend Dr. Maury Kessler to anybody. He's always quick and is a nice guy. The staff is also super friendly and the glasses I bought from there last year still get compliments!   The prices for contacts and glasses are also very competitive.

I don't live down the street from Eyecare Plus anymore, but I've always been a big fan of this 'mom and pop' office, and I have no plans of ever taking my business anywhere else.  And after an emergency visit there yesterday, that decision as been reaffirmed.  I had an eye infection which was making it impossible for me to keep my eyes open.  My girlfriend gave them a call, and I was squeezed in for an appointment about an hour later.  Dr. Kessler did another great job of carefully examining my eye while causing as little additional irritation as possible.  He gave me a prescription and recommended some over the counter drops to take in between uses (he also gave me a coupon for those drops).  Dr. Kessler even told me to give him a call if I had any problems over the holiday weekend, and he'd be able to see me.  How great is that?  Yesterday at this time, looking at a computer screen was painful.  Less than 24 hours after my office visit, the redness is gone, the inflammation has gone down, the irritation hurts a lot less, and I can keep my eyes open.  My vision and health insurance don't cover optometrist visits for health visits but it only cost me an office visit.  Worth every penny.  I'm looking forward to my regular exam later this summer.   If you're looking for an optometrist in the valley head over to Eyecare Plus, you won't regret it.

Mulligan's has been a regular spot for my friends and I to hit up in Scottsdale for years.  It's right in the middle of all the Scottsdale bars but you don't feel like you have to be all dressed up to be in there, the prices are good, and they don't charge a cover.  The place is pretty small, so it can get annoyingly crowded on some nights.  But Mulligan's isn't as popular as it used to be, so that's becoming a rare occasion.  The only major negative is how loud they play their music.  While I expect bars and clubs to play music at a high volume, it's super deafening in there.  It can be very hard to hear people when you're talking to them in there.

This is some great Asian Food! I first discovered Tottie's because it was in a shopping center right behind my old house, my roommates gave it a try and were big fans. After that I tried it, and I'm now a big fan.   The food is a little bit of everything Asian. Thai is their specialty, but everything on the menu is good. Actually, my only complaint is that the menu is way too big. It's way too hard to decide what you want.   I really love the Pad Thai. If you're not into hot food, watch out.  We had it medium and it still had a good kick (medium was not my choice, I would've gone for more heat).  For an appetizer I highly recommend the Vietnamese spring rolls (with an amazing peanut sauce). I also highly recommend the Tottie Rolls. It's a fried pork roll with a lettuce wrap and mint leaves.  The menu says they're the best rolls you ever had. They may be right!

If this is what you're into for donuts and coffee, then this is your place.  But I don't get what the allure of Dunkin Donuts is.  I don't care for the Donuts, I don't care to try the breakfast foods, and I think the coffees are alright, but I am not that big of a fan the popular creamy, fatty, fast food "coffee" that seems to be popular nowadays.  As you can probably guess, I haven't set foot inside a Dunkin Donuts in years.  But today I decided I wanted to check out the new K-cup coffee the franchise offers.  At first, I thought it was stupid that Dunkin Donuts only offers their flavors in stores, but now I realize that it's marketing genius.  That's because I decided I was in the mood for a snack, so I bought two Donuts.  The Donuts are underwhelming.  I've had supermarket bakery donuts that are much better and cheaper.  The K-cup coffee selection was also bad.  This location only had Hazelnut and decaf in stock.  I grabbed a hazelnut, which was actually pretty good, but there are several companies offering hazelnut flavors for Keurig coffee makers.  The Dunkin brand wasn't any better than the others, and I can get those flavors online or at any store that sells K-cups.  There are much better coffee and donut options out there.  I'd go with somewhere else unless you're a Dunkin loyalist.

I put my trust in my fellow Yelpers and they steered me right!   I got a nice pair of jeans at an amazing low price over Thanksgiving weekend. But the jeans are boot-cut and I'm short. A very bad combination. But the price and the look were so good, I decided I'd fix that later. Between a mix of laziness, then moving, then just forgetting about it, I never did get those jeans hemmed. Last week, I finally decided to get the job done. Not knowing much about hemming or alterations, I turned to Yelp for a recommendation around me and found several great reviews for Fifth Ave Alterations.   I can't say too much more than anyone else already has. The job was great, although it feels like it should have been done a little quicker (however, it was done in eight days instead of the nine she told me it would take). Cash only is also an annoyance (but the last couple of tailors I've ever gone to had the same policy). While my tailoring needs are few and far between, I would definitely take my business back to Fifth Ave Alterations.

Zipp's has some of the best bar food in the Valley. They have a really good burger menu, with some interesting options. All of their appetizers are good, and the focaccias are great. One word of warning if you order one, they're not the traditional sandwiches, but more like a wrap made out of focaccia. It sounds strange, and you'll give it an odd look the first time you see one, but trust me, it's good.   There's a great outdoor patio assuming you're there on a night that isn't hot. They have plenty of TV's set up around the place, but you don't have a good view of all of them, so Zipps isn't really the kind of sports bar you'd want to go to see all the games. It's more of Monday Night Football spot, it's better to go if there's only one or two big games going on.

This is one of the first places I think I've ever eaten at in Arizona, and after all these years, I keep coming back. If you're from the Chicago area, you've gotta give it a try. Don Carson took what worked in the windy city, and brought it to the valley.   The place is decorated with all sorts of sports gear, but you don't feel like your in a sports bar. It definitely has a classy vibe to it. The menu is pretty extensive for a rib spot. And there's always a good chance you may catch a pro athlete or two having dinner at Don and Charlie's (especially during Spring Training).   The ribs are fantastic. Not the best I've ever had, but there sure is no reason to complain. They're a little messy, but there's not too much sauce on them. Every meal comes with creamy or deli coleslaw and a potato or broccoli. Just enjoy. It's wonderful food!

Don & Charlie's is fantastic as always and on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  A $40 for $20 gift certificate.  Can't complain.

Things Remembered is that gift store filled with stuff that you can buy for anyone, but would never buy for yourself.  Everything is reasonably priced, but Things Remembered does get you with the engraving prices. It's not excessive, but it's the only reason someone would actually buy from this store.  But overall, you can still get away with a pretty good deal on a "personalized" gift.  The store is well set up. It's quite spacious, with the more feminine items on the left and the more masculine and gender neutral items on the right.  The sales girl I dealt with was very friendly, and she almost read my mind when it came to what I wanted for the font and design on the engraving.  It only took an hour.  So come here first, have lunch, do the rest of your shopping and your purchase will be ready.

While they were in town, I took my parents here on a Thursday afternoon to kill some time. Thursdays are free days at the SMoCA, and unless there's an exhibit there you really want to see, I'd say make that the day to go.   There really wasn't anything all that special there on my trip. Although I've heard they had some really cool things there in the past. The place is small, and it's a neat way to kill about 45 minutes if you're wandering around in old town. But if I had paid $7 to get in any other day, I would've felt robbed.

If there ever were a restaurant in the valley that made me think that I had died and gone to foodie heaven, it's Elements. Not only is the food top notch, but the entire ambiance, inside and out, is fantastic. Who'd have thought being seated in the back corner would be the perfect spot? Not only did we have a nice view of the Sanctuary's pool and several parts of the resort, but we were also treated to a breathtaking angle of the sun setting over the mountain. It was the perfect romantic setting for an anniversary dinner.   I had very high expectations and the food exceeded them. We started with the bbq duck confit. I cannot give a description of the chickpea pancake it's served in justice. I will only say that this was far and away the best duck I have ever had. For entrees we enjoyed the bbq short ribs "korean style" and char grilled flat iron. The short ribs were tender and fell apart with every scrape of the fork as they should. The sauce was incredible. I am convinced that it could have been poured on anything to make it good. The flat iron steak was wonderful. Perfectly cooked and well complimented by the corn spoonbread and mushrooms it was served with. My girlfriend rarely eats red meat, and she was not disappointed that we almost exclusive consumed beef products.   We weren't even given the chance to look at the dessert menu. I had mentioned it was our one year anniversary when the waitress casually asked if we were celebrating anything. A few moments after our dinner plates were taken, the waitress returned with a beautifully presented plate filled with what I can only describe as a chocolate dome, with a scoop of chocolate ice cream, and little black balls around it. The plate had "happy Anniversary" piped on it. It turns out it was their pb bomb. Chocolate peanut butter decadence! The little black balls were pop rocks. I don't know who was brilliant enough to put a gimmicky snack into a classy dessert. But you, my friend, are indeed a culinary genius.   I can now see why Chef Beau Macmillian is a regular on the Food Network. His menu is delicious. I cannot wait to return.

I have not shopped at this Trader Joe's in forever. That's mostly because it's kind of a pain to get to since it's in a location I have no reason to go for any other reason. But after today's trip I may come back more often.   They have really cleaned up and fixed up this location really, really well. My pet peeve about Trader Joe's in general is that all the stores feel crammed. Well, at some time since my last visit, everything has been moved around, and this store feels more open and spacious.  A great place to shop for groceries.

Why, oh why, do I aways give a Pei Wei another try?  Probably because the prices aren't bad, the menu looks like it should be excellent, and the quality of the food isn't that bad considering the restaurant is quick service.  But, having said that, I never leave a Pei Wei fully satisfied, and this location is no exception.  My girlfriend and I both ordered off the "Low Fare Dinner Menu."  To make a long story short; you can save a few dollars by getting less of the protein, more rice than I can eat, and a small side.  I had Honey Chicken with brown rice and a spring roll.  My girlfriend had Mongolian Chicken with brown rice and a spring roll.  It should be hard to complain for just $6.25 each, but the food wasn't very good.  The Honey Chicken (which was quite flavorful) only came with five or six bite sized pieces of chicken, and the Mongolian Chicken was so over sauced that the rest of plate had no other taste.  The spring roll wasn't anything that couldn't be microwaved from out of our freezer, and I got bored of the rice.  The only saving grace to this meal was spending less than $20.00 on dinner for two.

Jade Palace is one of the better chinese restaurants in a town that's shamefully devoid of such a wonderful cuisine.  I won't argue the quality of the food that's served at Jade Palace, but when it comes to american chinese, this restaurant is much more american than chinese.  The lemon chicken is a perfect example of my argument.  It's pretty good, but little about it screams chinese.  It's served as two pieces of flattened fried chicken (it looks a lot like a schnitzel) cut into long strips.  Eating this dish with a pair of chop sticks is nearly impossible.  You'll at least need to use a knife to cut it down in size.  Nitpicking aside, I love the lemon sauce which mixes well with the chicken and rice.  It's delicious.

In the year I have been working out at this LA Fitness, the experience has gone from adequate, to tolerable, to awful.   It pretty much goes back to LA Fitness' acquisition of Pure Fitness. Ever since they shut down the location on Rural, this location is always busy. There was barely enough equipment for the size of this gym's membership before all the Pure Fitness members came over. Now it's a fight to get on a popular bench or machine. Show up early if you want to have a quality work out.   On the plus side, I do enjoy the Spin Classes here. I highly recommend Rachael's class on Thursdays at 5:30pm. But as much as I enjoy the class, it's not enough to keep me working out here. I'm planning on moving, and will mostly likely cancel my membership unless I end up close to a decent LA Fitness.

I do most of my grocery shopping at Fresh & Easy, but that's a small place, so I tend to pick up what they don't have (or are out of) at this Fry's. It's close to my apartment which makes it easy to get to. However, it's close enough to a busy intersection at McDowell and Hayden, that if you go heavy traffic times, it's hard to get out of. The parking lot is also annoying to navigate through, and people tend to leave their carts all over the place. It would be nice if the employees did a better job of cleaning up those carts.   It's a decent enough supermarket. It's a good size, and tends to everything that I'm looking for in stock. Produce is a real hit or miss. Sometimes I pick up something and it expires in a day or two, other times it lasts a week or two. You just got to luck out and shop there when it's fresh. I think (like most grocery stores) Fry's gets its produce on Wednesdays and Fridays, so shop during the late afternoon on those days.   The store is clean, but nothing spectacular. It seems like other grocery stores in the area are trying to class up, but Fry's remains exactly what you'd expect it to look like. The class of shoppers kind of reflects that at this location. When compared to Fresh & Easy, the nearest Safeway, and even another Fry's a couple miles north, I tend to notice quite a few people with mullets here.

Who'd have thought that in a part of the country where basements are nonexistent, there's a fantastic restaurant that's entirely underground? Salt Cellar has always been my favorite place for sea food in the valley. The quality of the fish is always good and fresh, especially when you consider that Arizona is a landlocked state.   My girlfriend and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner at the Salt Cellar. She can't eat shell fish, which eliminates a lot of the items on the menu, but there's plenty of good options to pick from. We split a Halibut ceviche appetizer, which may have been the best ceviche I've ever had. Nothing against shrimp, but the Halibut is much more flavorful. I had Swordfish with mango salsa. The mango salsa was unreal. They left everything cut in big chunks, which was a little shocking at first, but it covered the whole fish, and was quite tasty. The fish itself tasted a little dry to me at first, but as I got to the center, I found that it was perfectly cooked, and the salsa continued to enhance the flavor. My girlfriend had Mahi. I tried a bite, and it was also delicious.   Entrees are around the prices you'd expect to pay at this type of establishment. But orders come with a salad, vegetables, and choice of potato or rice. Two glasses of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees cost a little more than $100 (not including tip). Not bad for a special occasion.   The place is very small (be prepared to be seated a little too close to the party next to) so reservations are a must. For parties of two, you can make them on Salt Cellar's website. They only thing I think Salt cellar needs is an update. While the dim lighting, wood and nautical theme is cool. The walls and art hanging on them walk a fine line between out of date and nostalgic.

A tiny little Chinese restaurant hidden away in an easily overlooked shopping center in South Scottsdale. If you don't live around here, you probably wouldn't know it exists. But you won't go wrong if you decide to have food from here.   New China Gate is a pleasant little place, with very friendly people running it. It's been a while since I've dined in, but every time my friends and I have eaten there it's been a lot of fun. While the food isn't really any better or worse than a typical small Chinese restaurant. The drinks are cheap ($4.00 Sake Bombers!), and the manager and servers treat you very well.   Take out and delivery are also pretty fast. Needing to pick up a couple of things from the Fry's next door, we ordered take out from here a couple nights ago. The person who took my order said it would be just 15 minutes. I arrived in a little less than that, and our food was already waiting for us. We had the Coco Chicken, which is something I wouldn't order on a regular basis, but I enjoyed. It's breaded chicken with almonds and a thick honey sauce. We also had the Chicken Lo Mien, which was also good.   While it's not a place I'd head out of my way for, I think anyone who lives around Hayden and McDowell with a craving for Chinese should skip the big chains, and enjoy this little local place.

I know three things when it comes to tires: 1. Tires need to be rotated. 2. When the tread wears, tires need to be replaced. (And I'd be lying if I said I knew when the tread reaches that point). 3. When I have a tire-related problem, I go to Discount Tire.  The shop is always busy, but somehow always quick. The tire I need (and not the most expensive) for whatever car I've owned at the time is always in stock. And I always feel like I've walked away with the best deal I am going to get.  Years ago, when I had a screw stuck in my tire, this Discount tire patched the tire for free when the dealership wanted to replace the tire for an exorbitant price. Recently; I had a similar issue. But I was worried that the tires on my car were ready to go (during my last service, I was told to expect to need to replace the tires pretty soon). I was told that I have about another year left on my tires, but also showed one that that was dangerously damaged. It was replaced with a decent tire that ended costing me less than I thought it would. Being in and out in less than an hour also did not hurt the experience.  There's a reason this shop has 4.5 stars with 50+ reviews. It's that good. Just go to the Discount Tire on Scottsdale and Oak for any of your tire needs.

Four Peaks is the perfect microbrewery! I've never had a beer from this place that I didn't like, and the food is top notch. Plus, no matter what night you hit up Four Peaks there's always a decent and fun crowd around you. It's also right off ASU's campus, but you never feel like you're at a college bar.   This location is a pain to park at, but once you get inside it's worth the small inconvenience. You can park on 8th street, but you may end up a distance from the bar unless you're lucky. I did have one shock when I arrived. It's been quite some time since I've been to the Tempe location, and it turns out it's a much more legit restaurant than it used to be. We were greeted by a hostess, and given a buzzer to wait for a table. This isn't the free-for-all I remember Four Peaks was when I was in college. We were seated outside. It was a cool night, but the patio was loaded with heaters.   With generous portions, the place is really good about sharing. My girlfriend and I met another couple here. We all ordered beers, nachos as an appetizer, and then both couples split a meal. Even though we split the meals, all four diners were given full size sides with the orders. I had half of a swiss and mushroom turkey burger. It was perfectly cooked to the point that I almost forgot I was having turkey instead of beef. The nachos were also great. But there was one negative, they brought the meals out just minutes after the nachos. The bad pacing for trying to keep everything hot while you're eating it. It also made it tough because there was no room on the table. But everything is so good, I'll let it slide.

Great Mediterranean!   I've been going to Pita Jungle for as long as I can remember, and I cannot get enough of the place. You must have the Hummus here. It's second to none.  Make sure you order a second pita.  All the food is great.  The staff is a young artsy crowd if you get my drift. You kind of have the feeling that you're eating at a place in the Village in New York. Infact, the atmosphere is feels pretty artsy, too. That's actually pretty odd considering this location is in a run down shopping center just off of ASU's campus.

It's the perfect little soup and sandwich spot.  Dilly's has a few locations around the valley and all of them are wonderful.  The Hot Sandwiches are huge and filling, and they come with a classic side (potato salad, pasta salad, coleslaw, etc) and a pickle. Dilly's also changes up their menu a little bit every now and then. While it's a shame to see some of my favorites go, it's great that I can walk in and try something new.  Their soups are also phenomenal and come in a bread bowl. I recommend asking them to mix the potato soup with the cheese soup... Amazing! The salads are weak, but unless you're ordering one in a combo, it's not really what anyone is there for.

This is one of the few places on Mill Avenue that I still like to drink at. Although you still get the ASU crowd, which makes me feel old, you still have a great time. On Friday and Saturday nights Rula Bula charges a cheap cover, but you also get some live entertainment, and you drink at one of the few places in Arizona which actually pours a Guinness correctly. Rula Bula also has a big patio, so on a nice night, it's a perfect place to hang out.   Tonight my cousin happened to be in town when he chose to give up his seat on his overbooked connecting flight. Since his hotel was right down the street from Mill, it was a convenient spot to get a beer and something to eat. We both drank a black and tan, which was excellently mixed. The food was actually pretty good. I just went with a corn beef melt, which was an alright sandwich. It was on ciabatta bread, which was doesn't quite compliment corn beef the same way that rye bread does. Nothing spectacular, but not bad. My cousin had chicken sliders which he seemed to enjoy. There also was a big selection of more authentic looking Irish dishes, but neither of us were hungry enough for anything bigger than what we had.

I cannot comment on the place itself because I've never been inside.  But thanks to the review of a friend, I found out just how easy it is to donate.  I had some couches and other stuff that I won't be needing after I move in a couple of weeks.  So I went to satruck.org to schedule a pickup online.  It was really easy to navigate through the website, tell them what you have, and find a date for them to come and pick it up.  Sure enough they came, and got the stuff out of apartment pretty quickly.  There are a couple of negatives.  It's hard to find the pickup page from the Salvation Army's homepage.  And they will not give you a pickup window until the morning of the pick up.  Not a big deal if you just have a couple of bags for them to pick up at your door, but not good if I had to be somewhere during the day when the window was suddenly available.

Good and Cheap!  What more do you need?  If you're a fan of mediterranean, you'd be doing yourself a misdeed by not giving this place a try.  I had the beef shawarma.  It was like brisket with a middle eastern sauce wrapped into a pita.  Awesome.  The only problem was that it was really, really messy.  the sauce leaked all over the place.  Napkins are a must.  My friend had gyro.  I took a small bite of the meat.  It may have been the best gyro ever!  I'll have to give a full one a try for myself someday.  The several types of baklava are delightful treat.  We went with cashew, pecan, and walnut.  All three were wonderful.  One big negative.  Only two pieces of pita came with our order of hummus.  Not even close to enough.  Make sure to order an extra (or two).  The hummus, like everything else, is fantastic.  The pita is pretty good, but nothing special by itself.  I didn't set foot inside, so I cannot tell you what it's actually like in there.  But the food is awesome.

For the longest time, I wondered what trick this place must have been using to be so successful in such an odd location.  When I was a student at ASU I walked past House of Tricks on my way from Campus to Mill Ave countless times, and I always thought it was out of place.  While even as a student I could appreciate the beauty of a house converted into a restaurant with an amazing garden patio as its setting, it just seemed odd that a such a fancy restaurant was hidden on small street, just feet from a college campus, surrounded by parking meters and pay lots.  Now that I have eaten at House of Ticks, I understand its charm.  A while back, my girlfriend mentioned that she had a great happy hour at at this place  with friends some years ago.  She couldn't remember the name, but based on her description I instantly knew she was talking about House of Tricks.  So, when we went to see "Wicked" at Gammage (great show, by the way) for her birthday, I decided it would be the perfect place to dine before seeing the show.  Turns out that's what a lot of people do.  The server even asked if we were heading to the show, so he knew to get us out with time to spear.  We also happened to overhear another server mentioned that about 90% of their customers on a given night were heading over to Gammage.  The food is quite pricy, but very tasty.  I had the Ancho Chili Seared Ahi.  The orange-chipotle honey aioli had a good kick.  The white bean chili had a unique taste.  The tuna it self was perfectly seared, but no too flavorful.  My girlfriend had a salmon dish which was amazing.  The salmon was very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  For dessert (we were celebrating a birthday, after all) we tried a brioche bread pudding.  One word: Wonderful.  If you are looking for a pleasurable meal with a pleasurable ambiance, House of Tricks will do the trick.  I highly recommend it before a show at Gammage or if you are just looking a romantic night out.

Caffe Boa offers up a really good meal, but a couple of things fell shy of making it great.  Still, my girlfriend and I enjoyed a lovely dinner with another couple.  The quality of the food is pretty high, which means the prices are as well, but we had a local dine (http://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485) giving us $20 off of $40.  Great deal.  We started with a pitcher of Sangria and a three cheese plate.  The Sangria was half price, but very disappointing.  The fruit and wine were mixed at the table.  That means the fruit was not soaked in the wine and it didn't have an ample opportunity to absorb its flavor.  The cheeses were fantastic.  All were served at the right temperature and the bread they were served with was amazing.  The waitress also screwed up and bought out a wrong cheese, so we got an extra.  Score.  I had the chicken scallopini Milanese.  It was perfectly breaded, and served with a wonderful garlic bean puree.  It was also covered with arugula, goat cheese, red pepper and cucumber.  It was kind of like a greek salad covering a schnitzel.  Good, but not really Italian.  My girlfriend had the agnolliti  boa.  Ravioli stuffed with mushrooms and covered in an awesome tomato cream sauce.  I didn't try them, but the voodoo penne and goat cheese ravioli were ordered, and there weren't any complaints.  We tried a tiramisu for dessert.  A board on the wall with the specials said it was "award winning," but much like the Sangria, it was very disappointing.  Too much coco powder on top and more of a bitter than sweet flavor.  A less than stellar dessert is forgivable, but it should be a crime for an Italian restaurant to serve a bad tiramisu.  The ambiance is also good, but a little off.  The wall decorations and the brick go together quite well.  But then there is an out of place table dead center of the restaurant where pictures of water are sitting out.  I get that this makes it easy for servers to get water to the tables.  But it just looks so odd.  And that board on the wall looks like a chalk board, which takes away from the high class ambiance.  Caffe Boa is just a couple of flaws away from being as good as it gets.  But despite those flaws, I highly recommend it.

Casey Moore's is one of few places in downtown Tempe were I can relive my ASU glory days, without remembering how long it's been since they passed me by.  It's probably the only spot around Mill Avenue where I can go to on a Saturday night and not feel like I'm too old to be there.  If it's not too crowded, and isn't too hot outside, it may be the perfect bar to relax and have a drink.  Maybe it's because the bar is in middle of a neighborhood, or maybe the koi pond, or the "fire pit," or all the wood tables, but when you drink on the patio, it feels like you're sitting in a big backyard.  If there were a pool, it would be the younger single me's dream backyard.  Casey Moore's also has pretty good selection of beers on tap.  What more do you need?  It's been a while since I've eaten at Casey Moore's, but the food is pretty good.  A few years ago, I had the opportunity to eat with a big party in hidden room on the upper level.  There's two converted bedrooms you'd never know about unless you got up there.  It was a pretty fun private dinning experience.  The staff was very attentive and engaging.  They even told a few stories about how the second room has haunted.  I'm not much of a believer in ghost stories, but still entertaining to hear.  We must have been up there for at least two hours before going outside to have some drinks in the crowd.

In addition to a name that makes everyone chuckle, The Horny Toad serves up some quality barbecue that the valley seems to be seriously lacking.  All I can say about the beef ribs is that they're out of this world!  Good beef ribs are hard to find in this part of desert (apparently a lot more people in arizona are partial to pork), and I enjoyed making a mess of myself devouring the meat off the bones.  The sauce is incredible.  The Horny Toad serves up a barbecue sauce that could turn almost any meat or poultry from good to amazing.  We sat on a picnic table outside.  Other than a strong breeze that sent napkins flying all over the place, it was a nice setting to enjoy some cue.  The price seems a little high, but the portions are massive.  The Food will keep you stuffed for the rest of the day, and then some.

Is Pizzeria Bianco really the greatest pizza I've ever had?  I'm not quite ready to go that far.  But does Pizzeria Bianco serve up incredible pizza that lives up to its hype?  Oh, dear God, yes it does.  We had the margherita pizza (this one at least may have been the best version of this classic that I have I've ever had) and the biancoverde (an amazing white pizza).  Simple.  Fresh.  Delicious.  Those are the three perfect words to describe Pizzeria Bianco.  The menu is small but everything looks tasty.  The ingredients are the definition of fresh.  The tomato sauce on the margherita tastes like it was cooked just before going into the wood fire oven.  I'd believe you if you told me the basil was picked when I ordered the pie.  I can say the same about the biancoverde.  The cow that provided the ricotta could've been milked that morning. The augural and rosemary, were also ridiculously fresh.  The prices may seem a touch high, but the quality of the food is worth every penny.   If I'm going to overindulge something so high in carbs and calories, I might as well know that it's not all processed junk.  The two pizzas were more than enough food for two people; but I won't lie, if there was a third pie, I would have happily consumed that one as well.  Everyone's top criticism of Pizzeria Bianco is the wait.  All I have to say about waiting hours for a pizza is this; You know what you're getting into before you enter the door.  Pizzeria Bianco isn't a place that most people stumble into on a whim.  It has a well deserved reputation, it's small, and you're most likely aware that there is a good possibility that you're dining experience is going to be two to three hours or more.  My fianc√© and arrived early on Saturday afternoon (4:30) expecting an hour wait.  We were told it would be about an 1:10 and we went next door to get a drink and wait.  To our surprise, in only about 15 minutes, a pair of seats at the bar opened up.  Lucky us.  Pizzeria Bianco is also now open for lunch.  From what I hear (and have just experienced) it is a lot easier to get in than it used to be.  You know you've been wanting to try it for a while.  Go ahead and do it already!

What a great cup of coffee!  All I had was a medium black Americano, and two thoughts swirled through my head: 1.  This is good coffee. 2.  why do we put up with corporate chain coffee shops when there really are so many wonderful little places like this?  Village Coffee Roastery is a nice little place to hang out and enjoy a cup or two.  There's a huge variety of creative espresso drinks along with the standards on any coffee shop menu.  Village also offers up some breakfast and lunch eats if you're hungry.  Don't be scared off by the upscale vibe of the shopping plaza Village Coffee Roastery is located in.  There's no pretentiousness here.  It's simply a nice little coffee shop.

When I first moved to Arizona in the late 1990's, the valley's foodie community was even smaller, and there were fewer websites to help us discover new places.  That was when The Bamboo Club was my little secret.  I would take many dates up from Tempe to a restaurant in Scottsdale that served a style of pacific rim which was much better than anything at PF Chang's (which was sadly popular and considered a standard at the time).  Bamboo Club then had a meteoric rise and fall, opening then closing several locations around the valley.  In a strange way the failure worked out for me, because Bamboo Club is once again my little secret.  While The Bamboo Club isn't quite as vibrant as it was back then, the food is still fantastic.  The mandarin orange chicken with crispy spinach is by far the best you will have in the valley.  The Macadamia nut encrusted halibut is also delectable.  Prices are a little high, but there's a great deal on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  A $40 for $20 gift certificate.  Totally worth it.

I grew up in the Chicagoland area. This is by far the closet thing to Chicago style pizza I've had anywhere outside of there. Whether you have the thin crust or the stuffed, you're eating some of the best pizza in the valley. I've dined at several of their locations, and can't say enough about how good it is.   And save room for desert. The Pizookie is fantastic. I highly recommend the peanut butter chocolate chip.   There is one negative.  If you decide to have something other than the pizza, be warned. The sandwich and pasta portions are huge, and make for lousy leftovers. They never seem to reheat well.

If you're expecting great things from Fashion Square, I hate to break it to you, but it's a mall. Plain and simple.  Considering the massive indoor mall is pretty much a dieing part of our culture, Fashion Square is wonderful for what it is; a place to shop, eat, and catch a movie in a climate controlled environment (although the theater here is pretty bad, so I would recommend skipping the movie unless you're going to the small artsy theater just outside). What really sets Fashino Square apart from most of the other malls and shopping centers in the east valley is that it's mostly filled with covered parking structures and underground parking. No walking across the parking lot on 110+ degree days here!   It's filled with mostly the typical mall shops, and some higher end stores for the Scottsdale crowd that can afford it. The stores it's missing are mostly the small mall shops that you usually never buy anything from because they're over priced concepts that were killed by the Internet and big box stores many years ago. If you have a need to shop, there's no reason to skip this place for anyother mall.

When more than 400 Yelpers are telling you to give Delux a try, you should probably listen!  While there really isn't anything unique about this small modern burger bar, Delux comes up where it needs to; it offers up a delicious burger.  There are only two on the menu (the Delux burger and the classic standard burger), but my party of four ordered them in a different way, and no one complained.  I had the classic burger cooked medium with swiss cheese.  When it arrived at the table I cut the burger in half, and saw (then tasted) a perfectly medium cooked patty.  I didn't recognize any crazy seasoning or added flavor to the beef, which is a good thing.  I like knowing that I'm eating a premium beef that doesn't require anything more than a pinch of salt and pepper.  And the brioche bun; out of this world!  My table also ordered a basket of regular and sweet potato fries.  The fries come in cool little shopping cart baskets.  Go for the sweet potato fries and dip them in the special aioli, you won't regret it, the fries are crispy and the aioli has a wonderful sweetness that compliments them quite well.  And if you're looking for a quality drink to go with your food, Half of Delux's menu is alcohol.  There's a massive selection of micro brews and imports on tap.  How can you go wrong?  Not into burgers?  There's also a few cool looking sandwiches and salads.  Put off by the location being in a strip mall?  Welcome to Phoenix.  That's where the best local spots are.

Chino Bandido is a mishmash of complete awesomeness!  This dive serves up some of the best mexican and asian fast food in the valley, and it's all on one dish.  The ordering process is confusing, and the decor (or lack there of) leaves a ton to be desired, and the place has a dirty feeling and is located in a pretty sketchy strip mall, but that's what creates its charm.  For those who do not know.  Chino offers up mexican and asian foods.  You can have it in a rice bowl, a combo bowl (two items plus beans and rice), grilled up in quesadilla, or wrapped in a burrito.  To order, you get a little form that can be odd to fill out, but they'll help you get it right (I don't get why they don't just ask you what you want and fill it out themselves, but it did feel like an accomplishment to get it right).  The best part about Chino (besides the food) is how friendly the staff is.  When we walked in, I informed the guy who greeted us that my parents had never been to either of their locations, so right away he told them to step on over, and he gave them some generous samples of their more popular dishes, and a pretty good description how the foods were cooked.  The food is high quality fast food.  Very unique and flavorful.  Plus every order comes with a snicker doodle, where can you go wrong?  The dining area is made of plastic costco tables and chairs and a big tv playing espn.  Very odd, but that's what makes Chino the wonderful dive that it is.

A really cool trendy burger bar just north of downtown Phoenix.  The contemporary ambiance gives off a really fun vibe that makes it feel cool from the moment you walk through the door.  I went with the fez burger.  If they're going to stamp their name on it, it should be good.  It's topped with spicy honey molasses barbecue, cinnamon pears, feta cheese, a lemon garlic aioli, and crispy onions.  Like all of FEZ's burgers it comes on a ciabatta bun, and the patty is shaped rectangular so it fits perfectly. Awesome that I never took a bite of just bread.  All the stuff on the few burger is very flavorful, but I think it over compensated for a less than stellar patty.  I wasn't too keen on the quality of the beef (plus, mine was undercooked, but not enough to complain.  My girlfriend actually said that her burger tasted overcooked, but also not enough to complain).  The salad that comes with the burger is quite tasty as well.  You can also substitute for fries for an up charge, but if you're with a group it's a much better deal to order a basket of fries.  The customer service is terrific.  Our waitress was a little slow, but she made up for it with a really cool act.  After a man at the table next to us got on a very loud and uncomfortable rant, yelling at the woman he was with (I don't want to get into what we was saying, but let's just say I was very happy that she got up and walked out on him), the waitress brought a free dessert to our table for having to sit through that.  It was totally unnecessary, but a wonderful gesture.  I'm going to say that FEZ was more of a three-and-a-half star experience, but deserves to be rounded up to four.  Although I think the place misses out on what's key (the chief should focus on a better beef patty and not all the fixings), there's so much that unique and done well at FEZ that I still walked away from an enjoyable dining experience, with a desire to give the restaurant another try.

I've heard such great things about Chelsea's kitchen, and I'm glad I finally checked it out.   The food is fantastic.  Most of us had the Howie Burger. Topped with caramelized onions, Gruyere, and a dijon sauce, it's a simple and perfect burger. The fries were really crispy and seasoned with garlic salt. Not really my thing, but I've never really been a big french fry guy. Everyone else liked them.  My girlfriend and another person in our party had the taco platters. My girlfriend had the Ahi Tuna. I tried a small piece of the fish, which was wonderful. As much as I liked my burger, I want to go back just to try any of the other items on the menu, because this was so good. It's also one of the few times I've seen her nearly clear her entire plate. The other guy had the pork taco platter, and really liked it.  We also split a pitcher of the Famous White Wine Sangria. A very sweet and satisfying drink.   The atmosphere is cool.  It has both a cozy and upbeat feeling. The music was a little louder than I would like, but that seems to be the "in thing" at restaurants nowadays. I hear the patio is the place to be, especially around sunset, but I guess that's an experience I'll need to save for another time. A note on parking, the only way to park is valet. It's complimentary, so there's no reason to complain (unless you're too cheap to tip the guy a buck or two). I just always find it funny when I watch a valet run to my car, when it's just a couple of feet away. It would quicker and more efficient to just give me my keys.   Chelsea's Kitchen is definitely the place to be. It was still pretty busy at 8:00 on a Saturday night, and the restaurant kept filling up after we were seated. Plus there were five people in our party, and four of us ended up having someone we knew come over to our table, or we went over to someone else's table to say 'hi.'   And on a humorous note...  While waiting, a couple people in our party who arrived early ordered an appetizer. The bar was packed, so they got it while waiting outside, instead. A manager had taken care of the order, but the charge was never added to our bill. Taking an honest approach, one of the people in our party tracked down that manger to inform him of the mistake. He comped it anyway, and jokingly asked that if anyone Yelps, to just give them a good review.  [I already planned to, but] little did he know...

My Dad has been wanting to try this place since he saw it on the Food Network. Well, now that he's in town, he got his chance.   It's a great little place to get breakfast. And by little, I mean very little. Matt's is tiny. We went on Tuesday morning, at 10am, and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. The first thing that opened up was at the counter. If you go on Saturday or Sunday, good luck.   Having said that, everything else about Matt's is great. I had some great griddle cakes there. I didn't even have to order a side, those three pancakes filled me up for hours! My dad had the special, which was eggs, sausage, fontina cheese, and potatoes and toast. My mom had an egg and bacon and cheese Breakfast sandwich. No complaints across the board.   The staff does a great job in the small, crowded environment. Each server seamlessly tag teams you during your meal. One person took our order, another gave us our drinks, another our food, and another handled the bill. Somehow they're perfectly organized in what appears to be total chaos!   I'd recommend checking Matt's Big Breakfast out sometime!

125 beers on tap is awesome.  Not putting the prices of said beers on the menu is not.  The food is also really good, but food prices are also very high.  That aside, Yard House is a pretty cool place to grab a drink or a meal.  It's big and spread out and rarely feels as crowded as the rest of the bars in Fashion Square Mall. There's also dozens of TVs set up around the place, making it a good place to catch a game.  We had a send off for a coworker on Saturday night.  It was a big group, and the servers did a great job.  We took up a big table and three or four booths.  The solution...  They arranged a letter and number system with each of us, which allowed us to order drinks and food separately throughout the night, and it gave us a stronger guarantee that there wouldn't be a mistake on our tabs.  It was the letter of our waitresses' first name, and the order which we were served.  They wrote it down for us on piece of paper.  Even the drunkest person in the group couldn't get it wrong.

A tiny strip mall located family owned business.  For those who know anything about valley food; that means you're usually going to find something great.  If you like Mediterranean, there's something at Eden's Grill Inn that will satisfy your taste buds.  I've had a few of Eden's Grill's platters at a party before, but this weekend was my first dining experience at the restaurant.  The dining room is small.  Probably not much bigger than my living room, but they manage to comfortably squeeze a good mount of tables in without it getting uncomfortable.  Some music (I'm assuming Greek) gives the place some added feeling.  The decor isn't much.  A few paintings and a lot of the clique "Best" whatever they were vote from the New Times or some other publications plaque's.  Those awards seem to be well deserved.  We both had the gyro pita lunch special.  For just $7.95, you get the sandwich, a choice of Greek salad, fries, or rice, and a drink.  When the sandwich arrived, I was shocked at the massive amount of meat.  I had to start with a fork just to eat it down to a size where I could use my hands and take a bit!  The tzatziki sauce is also excellent.  I'm guessing they mix some sort of sour cream in with the yogurt.  Whatever it is, it makes the sauce very flavorful.  The pita bread may be the best I've ever had.  It's almost more of a hybrid or a naan and a pita.  A little oily for bread, but delicious.  The service was as good as the food.  The owner really made us feel welcome, and was as nice as can be.  The lunch specials are cheap.  The regular entrees can be pretty pricy.  But portions are pretty big, so it's best to come here with a group of at least four and split a few items.

Hidden away behind a sea of strip malls, this restaurant is a contradiction of itself in a great way. It's Asian and Mexican. It's really fast food, yet everything tastes fresh. The menu board is all pictures and cheap like a 'berto's stand, but the place is big and clean. The tables and chairs are plastic and foldout, but there's a big plasma TV and pictures hanging on the wall. But most important; the food is cheap and fantastic!   We walked in and I looked at the big menu board in awe. There more than a dozen items listed, and four ways to have them. The combo is any two items with beans and rice. You can also have them wrap up any item in a burrito. Any item served in a quesadillas. Or a single item rice bowl. My girlfriend told the guy at the register that I had never been there before, and he asked me what I was interested in trying. I couldn't make up my mind, so he brought me samples of three of the more popular items. The jade chicken, the jerk chicken, and carintas. I wouldn't have complained about any of the three. I decided to go with the jerk Chicken and jenred Pork combo. You also get a cookie. I went with a chocolate chip (I'll explain in minute why that was mistake).   I highly recommend the Jerk Chicken if you like hot food. The heat hits you a second or two after you take your first bite. As you continue to eat, it keeps getting hotter but never overpowering. The Jenred Pork was on par with any Asian restaurant's sweet and Sour pork. The black beans in the combo are wonderfully sweet, but not too sweet. The only thing I was disappointed with was the cookie. The chocolate chip cookie was over-baked and too sugary. My girlfriend had a snickerdoodle with her meal, which she said was the best snickerdoodle she's ever had. I tried a small piece. As usual, she was right.

If you need an in depth review of Ikea, you also need to get out from under your rock.  But, for what it's worth, I also feel like weighing in my two cents.  The store is massive and filled with a plethora of cheap, but trendy looking furniture and home goods.  Some of it is great.  Some of it is garbage.  Most of it is perfect for an apartment or rental home, especially if you'd rather ditch your stuff rather than move it.  For a guy like me who has moved more times than I'd care to remember, Ikea has been the choice decor for many apartments for the past six or seven years it's been in the valley.  Much of it has also ended up in a dumpster or with the Salvation Army, and I can't say that I miss it (although I regret the couple of times I've bought the same thing a couple years later).  Be sure to check out anything you plan to purchase in the showroom on the upper level before you buy it.  If you don't, you have no one to blame for assembling a cheap and uncomfortable piece of crap except yourself.  There's plenty of maps you can grab, if you're affraid of getting lost in the market place, feel free to take one.  It's okay, no one will laugh at you.  The amazing Odor of the cinnamon rolls in the cafeteria is pure ecstasy.  The crowds are unbearable on weekends, but if you can make it to Ikea during the week, you're golden.  If you have to make a long trip to get to the store, check the website ahead of time to get an idea of what you're looking for.  If you don't, it could be a very long day.

A very solid sea food restaurant, classed up in the dark classy Scottsdale ambiance that you'd expect.   Prices are high (it's a sea food restaurant), but the food is worth it.  Wildfish is a place I've wanted to try for quite a while, and thanks to an excellent Restaurant Week menu, I finally did.  We had the spicy tuna roll.  With avocado, cucumber, and cilantro, it came together quite nicely.  It's not something that would take me away from a regular sushi bar, but certainly a perfect appetizer.  Asian barbecue steelhead trout.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  I enjoyed the sauce.  It had a great kick, but it tasted much more american barbecue than asian.  We also went off the restaurant week menu and had lemon sole.  This was one nice fish.  We finished the restaurant week selection with vanilla bean creme br√ªl√©e.  This is was an unfortunate miss.  It was hot.  Creme br√ªl√©e is supposed to be made in advanced, cooled off, then the top is torched.  This was warm all the way through.  The peanut butter cookie that came with it was tasty, but did not compliment the dish any further.  Not at all what I was hoping for.  Other than the disappointing dessert, it was an all around great dining experience.  The service is wonderful.  The staff is very friendly, and plates were cleared and drinks were refilled very quickly.  I should also mention that the bread we received before the appetizer was straight out of the oven, hot!  The cold butter melted right on it.

There's not much I can say for Desert Ridge Marketplace that hasn't been expressed by other Yelpers.  Living in the immediate area, I probably end up at Desert Ridge at least once a week. No, it isn't the greatest shopping center ever set up.  But, between places like Target, Khols, Petsmart, an AMC movie theater, and several sit-down and fast-food eating options, Desert Ridge offers a ton of places that will satisfy your immediate needs.  The major downsides occur on the weekends.  While many people seem to complain that there isn't that much at Desert Ridge, it seems to easily get slammed.  Parking on Saturdays and Sundays can be a real headache.  Also, on any given Friday and Saturday night, you're also going to put up with the obnoxious loitering teen crowd.  And if you're the type of person that can't stand little kids running around, avoid the fountain area by the "food court" on a hot day.

I love a good sandwich, and that's exactly what Essence delivers.  This small breakfast/lunch spot and bakery is just down the block from barber shop I have been going to for years, and today I happen to be in the area around lunchtime, with a craving to try something new.  I had the ham, cheese & jalape√±o croque-monsieur.  What a fantastic meal.  The jalape√±os were just enough to add a kick, but not overpower the flavor.  The sauce that is cooked on top of the sandwich may not be unique to french cooking, but it's not something I'm accustomed to, and I loved every bite of the top piece of bread.  The french dijon potato salad was a wonderful side dish.  If you're looking to save some fat and calories, you would go with a salad instead.  The sandwich was just the right size and filled me up.  Definitely worth the $8.25 I paid for it.  What I didn't care for was the lemonade.  Don't get me wrong; it was good, but certainly not worth the $3.00 I paid for it.  There isn't much of an ambiance to describe.  The restaurant looks like a typical cafe.  Order at the counter, they bring your food to you.  The staff is very friendly.  I didn't notice the little stand with silverware and napkins, and the woman that brought me my food saw that I didn't have a fork, so she went and got me one.  A nice little touch of service.  The big feature at Essence is supposed to be the Macarons.  I have been told that they are some of the best in the valley.  I was way too stuffed to try one, so I bought a couple of French Chocolates to take home.  I'll update the review when I have room in my stomach to give one a try.  ** UPDATE 9/28 **  The french chocolate macaron is awesome.   Chocolaty gooey goodness!  An almond chocolate cookie sandwich with the consistency of a brownie, and a rich chocolate fudge filling.  Wonderful.  As good as its hyped.  I could eat one of these every day!

I'd bet on The Vig. (For those who don't know; a vig is the amount a bookie takes when you win a bet.  Don't ask why I know this).  While it may just appear to be another trendy gastropub in Arcadia, it does provide good food, good drinks, and a fun vibe.  And if you're looking to save some cash, Local dines has a great deal for this place.  $30 for $15 (https://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485).  I had a "love me tenderloin" sandwich.  The pork was cooked a little dry, but the dijonaise sauce, onions and mozzarella moistened it up and added some great favor to the sandwich.  The pretzel bun was nothing short of awesome.  And I certainly couldn't say no to a side of sweet potato fries (one of several side options).  My friend had a burger and fries which he seemed to enjoy.  Like a lot of places in Arcadia, it's interior is kind of small but there is a large outdoor seating area.  The parking lot is also very small and you really can only park by using the free valet.  It's also right next to a neighborhood, so you'll see some  My only complaint.  The server has a little less than stellar.  While he seemed nice.  He disappeared after our food arrived, and we didn't see him again until we finished eating.  Would've been nice if he checked on us once or twice in between.

Two very big thumbs for for double up!  Two for one sushi Saturday through Monday; How could you go wrong?!  We had a spicy tuna roll; A classic, very good.  A salmon roll with avocado; this was a specialty order they had no trouble making for us.  A sunset roll; crab, yellowtail, tuna, and avocado all came together quite nicely.  And a crazy roll; spicy tuna, shrimp, tempura, avocado and cucumber makes for a very tasty roll!  Satori has pretty much the same look and feel as any small hip sushi bar in the valley.  The place was fairly empty, but it was only 6:00 on a Monday.  The service was pretty good, and the rolls came out very fast.  It's not the best sushi in the valley, but it's very high quality for a low price.  Hit up Satori on Saturday through Mondays night and you won't leave disappointed.

There really isn't anything that sets this movie theater apart from any other.  It has plenty of nice auditoriums, with a pretty good sound system, and the seats are quite sizable and not uncomfortable.

From the moment I walked into this place, I knew I was going to enjoy it.  I cannot explain why I liked the atmosphere, but it had a fun classy feel to it. A little dark, but still has a cool vibe.   My girlfriend and I arrived a few minutes before the other couple we were dining with showed up.  We were still seated right away, and we spent the whole time looking over the menu.  I could have ordered anything on it!  Everything sounded spectacular.   The group decided to start with grilled artichokes as an appetizer.  After a very short wait two good sized artichokes, with some parmesan on them, and a really good dipping sauce arrived.  Then our meals arrived at what felt like the perfect amount of time later.  We had citrus soy glazed salmon, which was probably the best salmon I've had at a place that doesn't just specialize in sea food. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was sweet, but not overpowering.  We also tried what looked one of the most unique dishes on the menu.  Rotisserie chicken crepes.  It was covered in a mushroom and Madeira sauce.  Very different, and very good.  Most of their entrees come with some really good sides.  We had the honey roasted carrots (Delicious.  I was told these were good and they did not disappoint), and Israeli couscous (also delicious).   The big kicker was the dessert.  The place is called The While Chocolate Grill, so the dessert has to be good!  The table all split the french white chocolate bread pudding.  I cannot explain how great this was. Bread pudding made from croissants, topped with white chocolate, caramel, and cream. It was irresistible!   The prices were good, and the meal was worth every penny.  There's so much more on this menu that I want to try, so I will definitely be back.

Yard House is a solid upscale sports bar chain.  There are dozens of TV's around the restaurant insuring that there's a view of whatever game you'd like to see.  I've had nothing but great service on every visit.  The food is good, albeit a bit overpriced.  Also; with more than 100 beers on tap to choose from, the alcohol selection is unbeatable.  On general principal, I have never had the same beer twice at Yard House.  The service really does set the place apart.  On a visit sometime last month, the turkey burger my wife ordered came out as turkey sliders and covered in some bizarre she didn't want to eat.  After taking it back and making countless offers for more fries or anything else to hold her over while she waited for another to be cooked, the turkey burger was unexpectedly taken off the bill.  Yard House is perfectly located in the "food court" area of Desert Ridge.  It's just a few convenient steps from the AMC, making it a good spot to eat before or after a movie.  It feels like a bonus if I'm seeing a movie at time that lets me take advantage of its happy hour.  The only things I don't like about Yard House is the food is a bit pricy for what it serves.  It's really just fancy sports bar food and some standard american restaurant meals.  Yard House also gets packed quickly.  Arrive during typical dinner hours (especially on Friday or Saturday) and you better expect a long wait.

Chandler Fashion Center represents the last of the dyeing breed of giant indoor shopping malls.  At just a little more than a decade old, It certainly is the most spacious and modern.  It's also very well maintained and occupied.  All the stores you need are either inside, share a parking lot, or are right across the street.  It's pretty hard not to find what you are looking for in or around Chandler Fashion Center.  The location was perfectly chosen.  The mall stands right at the crossing of the Loop 101 and the San Tan Loop 202, with plenty of entrances/exits to the major streets.  It's very easy to get in and out, even during heavy traffic periods.  The parking is also very accommodating although it can be tough to park on the south side (where the movie theaters, food court, and many of the restaurants are located) when the mall is busy.  It also would be nice if there were a parking structure or two so shoppers don't have to walk across a blazing hot parking lot during the summer.

A good concept to keep what was a dyeing movie theater alive.  The big comfortable reserved seats and no one under 18 without supervision policy make for a nicer viewing experience.  You can see movies in a suite cinema for $3 more, the only point I see in spending more money for a nicer seat is knowing you're in a theater where everyone is over 21.  Not worth it to me.  The full bar in the spot that used to be a concession stand is a nice touch.  The food is reasonably priced, but not all that good.  The burger I had was probably on par with something from a cliche american chain restaurant.  Decent, but nothing special.  You can get much better food across the street for similar prices.  I also found it a little difficult to eat my meal.  The big reclining leather seats are nice for movie viewing, but I did not enjoy leaning forward to take a bite and not worry about spilling all over myself.  The staff did a nice job of trying to stay transparent during the movie.  You have to press the button for service, but the waiter did quietly ask if I needed anything else when he bused away my empty tray, and dropped off the check.  And to make things better, when the credits started rolling he advised audience members who were getting up to leave to stay until the end because there was a stinger.  The heads up was much appreciated.  I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to give this theater a try.  But if you live in the Biltmore or Arcadia areas, this is probably your best option.

Why on earth would anybody in central phoenix eat at any of the fast food burger chains, when Lenny's Burger Shop is right in the center of town? The place serves up a fantastic quick burger for a very low price.   For just $6.75, I had a Mexican Burger Combo. The beef is wonderful and the burger is topped with grilled Onions, green chilies and jack and cheddar cheese. The only thing I didn't care for was the mayo. I thought it was very unnecessary to slab mayo on both buns, but I am not a mayo lover like most people are. This beats anything that Five Guys, In & Out, McDonalds, Burger King or Jack in the Box offers.  High quality food, low price.  The fries weren't all that special, but there are countless options of upgrades (including onion rings and sweet potato fries) which I'll have to try sometime.   The place screams all American 50's dinner. All red and metal. This is the kind of place you see in movies like "American Graffiti." The only negative is the location and parking lot. Because of the light rail in the middle of Central, it's hard to get in and out. The lot is also very small for the amount of businesses located in the plaza. I Could see it being a pain to navigate during a busy weekday lunch rush.  There's a huge menu of good cheap food.  If you're looking for a classic burger, hot dog, and fries...  Look no further than Lenny's!

I don't understand how people don't like the light rail. It's a good form of public transportation, something that the valley is seriously lacking. My only complaint is that we should have spent the extra cash to make it a monorail. That way it wouldn't have to stop for lights and it would keep the bad drivers from trying to make an illegal u-turn and getting hit by a train. For those of you who point out that the system is losing money, the problem is it's in its infancy and needs to be expanded before it can be fully utilized.  It's a cheap ride. I personally use it by leaving my car at my office downtown whenever I go to the airport. The fee to take it there and back is a lot less than parking, and a lot easier than pestering a friend for a ride. The only argument against that is that it turns a 15 minute ride to airport into a 30 to 40 minute ride (that includes the bus that takes you to the terminals).   Yes, like all public transportation you're going to encounter some odd characters on the train. As in most cases, if you keep to yourself, all should be good. The riders that actually bug me the most are the people who take their bikes on the train during busy hours. There are bike racks in part of the cars, but I'm always left wondering... If you have a bike, why don't you ride it?

I'm not generally one to say I am a fan of Bed, Bath & Beyond.  Don't get me wrong, It's a good store.  Always has the bedding, kitchen and bathroom stuff that I want at need.  The company also sends out $5.00 and 20% coupons out nonstop.  I'm just not all that into home decode.  The one thing at consistently draws me in is the massive selection of K-Cups.  What makes me a big fan of this store is the great customer service.  I didn't have a coupon, but I was out of coffee and happen to be passing by, so I ran in.  There was one person a head of me at the one register that was open.  The clerk called for backup which never came.  While it wasn't a big deal, the clerk scanned a 20% off coupon to make up for the trouble.  Guess who's coming back to this store again?

I have a major love/hate relationship with Sprint. I'm not a big fan of the company's phones or service, but I have a really good deal through a family member who used to be an engineer with the company, which keeps me connected to Sprint's service.   The downside with my plan is that I rarely can go to the stores for help. But while trying to switch phones, a customer service person shut off my phone, and the new one still wouldn't activate. So I ran to the store to see if there was something that could be done. The people in the store were very helpful trying to solve the problem themselves, but they could only do so much (employee family plans can't be done through the store).  So they let me use one of their landlines and dialed me through to the right people who could get something done.  I tied up one of their service areas for a good half hour, but I never felt like I was in the way.  I've also stopped in a few times to take a look at the phones and just ask a question or two.  I always tell them right away that I won't be buying that day, but they were still really good about taking care of my questions.

I absolutely love the soups and sandwiches at Dilly's Deli.  The food at this location is just as good as the rest around the valley.  Prices have gone up a bit, but you'll still get your money's worth.  The bread for the sandwiches and the bowls for the soup are ridiculously fresh (even though there is way too much of it).  The one thing I don't get about this location is the hours?  Closing at 4:00 is kind of random to me.  It seems like they'd be able to stay open a few more hours for the quick dinner crowd.  But they've been in this space for a while when so many other stores and restaurants have come and gone, so I guess they know what they're doing.

I rented a mailbox from this UPS store for six months.  I never used the place for shipping, copying, key duplications, or anything else, but the employees were all really nice and professional.  They knew who I was and which box was mine.  I never had any problems receiving any mail or packages.  I needed the box because of a temporary living situation where we didn't have access to mail.  The prices are high compared to the post office, and the address you get becomes obnoxiously long, but good luck finding a post office without a waiting list for a box.  Things were a little rough at first because the store had just switched owners at the time we opened the box.  But after a week or two, they got into sync, and everything was great.

At first glance, you'd never know that Cinemark is fairly new.  It's only five or six years old, but the box office, lobby, and concession stand all have an old and dated appearance.  But while this theater may not be as glitzed up as a Harkins or AMC, the auditoriums are way better. They're completely stadium view, the seats are big and comfortable and the projector and sound system are both digital.  It's a fantastic viewing experience.  The prices here are exactly the same as Harkins.  Next time I'm seeing a movie, I may pass up the busy Tempe Marketplace scene (hard to park and bigger crowd) for the much more layed back Mesa Riverview scene.  It's just one exit over.  I have nothing against the valley's major theater chains, but I'm happy that there's a new (and maybe better) option.  More competition is always a good thing.

The gas prices at this Circle K are always on the cheaper side (at least as far as gas is concerned).  It's also conveniently located on the way to downtown Phoenix, just south of the I-10, to and from my way to work.  But, the layout of the parking lot makes this one of the most inconvenient gas stations to fill up at.  First problem;  There's only four pumps, all of which are located in the corner of the lot.  If there's one car using the pumps on either side, it's a major challenge to drive around them.  If the only free pump is facing the wrong way for your gas tank, maneuvering around the parking lot to face the right way is also a tough challenge.  Plus, on at least one occasion, another driver swooped in and stole my pump while I was trying to do this.  You really have to get lucky, or make some very quick decisions about how to enter the gas station while you're driving towards it.  Second problem;  The tiny parking lot.  I understand that space is limited, but between the gas situation, and people trying to pick up a drink or a snack from the shop, just driving to a parking space can be a headache.  Third problem;  Ghetto.  I'm a 32 year old man and I am uncomfortable stopping by this Circle K when the sun is not out.  The location is being renovated, but that doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of seedy people hanging around this part of town.

This was the hotel my guests and I stayed at for my wedding.  Even if you don't include a group block rate, the prices at the Hilton Garden Inn are incredible for North Scottsdale.  This may be one of the cheaper hotels in the area.  The staff is also easy to work with and very accommodating.  Lexy, the sales manager, was wonderful about addressing all of our concerns about reservations and arranging transportation for our guests.  The rooms are clean and spacious, and each has a microwave and mini fridge.  The shower had great water pressure, and I have no complaints about the comfort of the bed.  I didn't watch very much TV, but I believe there was a full list of channels not just the standard hotel package of 10 to 20 channels and HBO.  The outdoor pool is well shaded by the building and trees around it, making it a perfect spot to cool off on a warm summer afternoon.  If you're looking for a basic hotel, this Hilton Garden Inn will surpass needs.  If you need more amenities, there are several resorts in just minutes away.

My first impression of this location is that it is most likely going to be my only impression of this location.  I don't hold very high expectations for an LA Fitness.  At $25 a month, I'm getting what I pay for.  But at this location, I'm getting ripped off.  My high school (which I graduated from back in 1998) had a better weight room.  This gym is tiny, the location is inconvenient, and the equipment is minimal and old.  The place was not crowded at 3:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, but it's so claustrophobic inside that it might as well have been.  There is no room.  What's even more impressive to me about there being no room is there are very few machines.  So how does LA Fitness make it feel like they're utilizing the space?  By spacing the machines farther apart than most gyms would.  Sure, it's nice that you're not on top of the person working out next to you.  But, it would be nice if they would add a second or third option of popular machines and benches.  Get used to the disappointed looks you get when you sit at a machine and someone that doesn't want to work in you sees you take it before they can.  I can't even count how many times I gave and received that look in the hour I was working out.   The free weight section is overcrowded, but that's because it is ridiculously small.  It's almost as if this is the only gym in the world that thinks people don't use dumbbells.  Not only are there not enough dumbbells or benches, but many of the dumbbells and preset curl bars were missing labels.  I had to guess if I was grabbing the right weight based on the sizes of the ones that still had their labels.   This location is also missing a spin room.  The bikes are in the same room that is used for Yoga, kickboxing, and everything else.  That may explain why the class schedule is minimal compared to other locations.  I will give this LA Fitness one positive mark.  It's well kept.  The gym and locker rooms are probably the cleanest of any location I've ever worked out in.  At least the staff is doing its job.

One certainly doesn't eat here because the food is good. With the exception of the crazy bread (which is awesome), the food is terrible. I pick up and take out Little Caesars because it's cheap. The hot-n-ready carry out is just $5. A large cheese or pepperoni for just $5. That's two days worth of food for me. How can I go wrong?   Well this place manages to screw it up. I happen to be one of the few people in America who doesn't practically care for pepperoni. About half the time I stop in, there isn't a cheese pizza ready. I don't want to argue semantics, but doesn't hot-n-ready mean they have one that is hot and ready to be taken out? Usually when this happens, it's just a short wait, but today they didn't even have one in the oven. It was 1:00. Lunch time. The place wasn't busy. How can you not have at least one in the oven? I disappointingly took a pepperoni and asked for the cheesy jalapeno dipping sauce. The guy charged me and told me to have a good day. No sauce. I asked about it and he points out that he didn't charge me for it. To be honest, I noticed that the charge seemed low, but not in the mood to hand the guy my credit card for 50 cents that he forgot to charge me, I just grabbed my pizza and walked out. I know I could have just had him swipe my card again or even try to argue and get it for free, but I just couldn't deal with this guy anymore. Try to help your customer, not disappoint him twice in less than 5 minutes.

I've come back to Little Caesars Pizza a few times since my last review. I'm not ashamed to admit that I slum it once in a while. The pizza is still way below average, but the $5 dollar price tag draws me in. During each visit, they actually had a cheese ready, and the guy at the counter actually appeared to know what he was doing.  I really don't recommend this place unless you're looking to get some pizza, but want to save some cash.

Good burgers.  Good beer selection.  A great happy hour that goes to 7.  What more do you need?  My only real issue with Zipps is that they don't have enough TV's for a sports bar.  Sure, you can see most of the big games, but if you're there on a Sunday to catch a random football game that not too many other people want to see, then you may be out of luck.  I also don't get the "window" tv screens between the bar and the dining room.  They're awesomely huge and sharp, but if you're on the bar side, everything is backwards.  It gets very awkward.  I love the burgers.  They're pretty cheap, cooked right, and served with a choice of wonderfully greasy onion rings, fries, sweet potato chips, half and half of any two, or a salad.  The focaccias are also also pretty good.  Just a heads up, they're not traditional focaccia.  It's more like a wrap with a pita made with a focaccia recipe.  It's a style that's unique to Zipps, and is actually pretty good, just a little shocking the first time you order it.

Have you ever had a shopping experience where you are convinced that the sales associate wants to kill you despite the smile on her face?  Yeah, we were those customers at the Guess store in the Outlets at Anthem.  I was waffling back and forth about a purchase I was making for gifts, my fianc√© was asking questions that made little to no sense to her, and the store was pretty busy and severely under staffed.  I'll give Sabrina all the credit in the world.  She put up with us and was very professional.  She never gave us a look or rolled her eyes during what had to be annoying experience, which only made the store a couple hundred dollars.  She was also easy to work with a few days later when we realized that we were one item short and called up the store to have one shipped to us (if you call they can do this for you).  The store itself is small and carries a decent amount of fashionable clothing.  The blasting pop music doesn't do too much for me, but I'm sure it appeals to the younger crowd that shops here.

This location is pretty much the same as every other location.  Good bar food, decent service, and fair prices.  Like others have suggested, I would like to see a bigger beer selection.  It would also be nicer if a few more food items were on the happy hour menu.

The carpet in one of the rooms of my old house looked awful after an occupant with a big dog (and who wasn't all that cleanly herself) moved out.  My girlfriend called a few places and ended up going with Kiwi since they not only offered a low price, but they have a good guarantee and an awesome loyalty program.  After the first call, Kiwi will return anytime and lower some of the fees.  They did an awesome job, and the carpet in the room looked as good as new.  So when we moved out, we had Kiwi come back to touch up that room, and clean up the rest.  All of the carpets looked great.

I bought my car from Berge Mazda two years ago, but quickly stopped taking it in for service there.  They charged about $60 for my car's inspection (which pretty much amounted to nothing more than a traditional oil change, fluid topping, and tire rotation).  Then they showed me that there was something lodged in my tire.  They said it was too big to repair and wanted $150 to replace the single tire.  After having a good laugh, I took my car to a Discount Tire Co. and they repaired the damage for free.  It turned out the thing lodged in my tire was a drill bit.

I can still remember being at ASU more than a decade ago, and laughing late at night every time I saw a commercial for Flo's.  No matter what I was watching, somewhere between midnight and 3:00am it would air at least once.  A cheap, but somehow overly produced ad featuring an asian woman with a heavy accent introducing herself, and explaining why I should eat at her restaurant.  Yes, it's quite immature, but it led to a friend of mine and I becoming obsessed with trying Flo's on general principal.  And when we finally did, we were surprised to become big fans.  All these years later, Flo's is still in the valley, still awesome, and still popular.  (for better or worse, the commercials are gone).  My girlfriend and I ordered takeout, and at 5:45 on a Friday, the place was slammed.  I'm not one to go by the adage that popular means good, but when a lot of valley residents are passing up the chains or a local spot, it's a positive sign.  We had the lettuce cup (think PF Chang's lettuce wraps with a fresher taste), Kung pow chicken (holy crap this was good), beef and snow peas (also awesome).  The meats were all sliced, cooked, and sauced perfectly.  I have nothing bad to say about any of those dishes.  Food is good.  Portions are good.  Prices are good.  The only negative is trying to park.  The strip mall this restaurant has very limited parking.  It can be a battle for a spot during peak lunch and dinner hours.  It's also very loud inside when it's busy, but that seems to be a trend nowadays, so I guess that makes Flo's a trendsetter.

In a place like Kierland Commons, where the lower end eateries are PF Chang's and The Cheesecake Factory, it's nice to have a quick and cheap option to grab a quality lunch.  Chole's Corner fits perfectly into the urban lifestyle concept of this shopping center.  It reminds me a lot of the sandwich shops you can find on a random street in a Chicago or New York Neighborhood.  Order your food at the counter, seat yourself, they'll bring it to you when it's ready.  If you're in a hurry, grab some of the refrigerated ready-made options.  The hot and cold sandwiches, the soups and salads are all fresh and delicious.  I've never had any of the treats or breakfast offerings, but I'm sure it's just as good as lunch.  I've also never ordered the grilled cheese, but have been told it is nothing short of amazing.  The most expensive item on Chole's Corner's menu is $7.75.  No sides are included, but the portions are perfect.  You can enjoy a good lunch for about $10 if you include a drink.  My only disappointment about this place is that it closes at 6:00pm.  I understand that it's a lunch and breakfast spot, but why not stay open an extra hour to catch a shopper who just ran into one of the stores to pick something up on the way home from work?

I find Westgate's existence very perplexing.   Speaking strictly as an eastsider, I can't image ever coming all the way out to this place for any reason other than an event at the arena or stadium. And even if I were a westsider, I'd probably avoid the place because I'd have to check that there isn't a game or concert going on if I want to go there. The parking situation is an absolute mess if there is an event going on. Somebody please build another access road or two to the Loop 101!   While I like most of the bars and restaurants in Westgate, there's nothing special about them. It's mostly chains that you can find elsewhere in the valley. Some of the shops are unique, but not unique enough to justify a ride out west. Westgate is too big for the hockey crowd, but too small to support the football crowd. Good luck getting into any of the bars before or after a Cardinals game. If you're one of the few who went to see the Coyotes play, the place is all yours after the game is over. You'd also expect there to be more fast food options for the people just trying to avoid high prices inside the venues, but there are only a few.   I will give the designers credit, the place is beautifully set up. The fountains are nice to look at and getting around is simple. It's just too bad it's not in an area that's set up for foot traffic unless there's 60,000 people in the area for a game. And when that's the case, I'd rather stay away from these shops.

I will never understand the hype behind this place. It's another example of a spot were everyone tells you it's the best, but the truth is it's nothing spectacular.  I actually find it ironic that the woman who founded this bakery chain always uses the phrase 'your cupcake underwhelmed me' on the Food Network Show "Cupcake Wars."  That's because it's the perfect way to describe her own cupcakes.  They're not bad, they're just not worth the high price you pay for them.  I don't mind paying good money for good food (especially a good dessert).  But Sprinkles just doesn't do it for me.

I frequent this theater the most since it is the closest to home. It's big, clean, and there's plenty to do before and after watching a movie since it's located in Tempe Market Place. It does get quite crowded here during busy hours, but not any worse than a typical theater. This location also has a lot of late showings thanks to its close proximity to ASU.   I like that all the auditoriums have stadium seating, and a pretty good sound system. The Cine Capri is a unique experience since the screen is huge and the sound system is massive, but I am not sure if it's really worth the extra dollar.   My only real gripe with Harkins (and this applies to most of their locations) is that ticket prices are starting to not be worth their value. While the price itself is not anymore than other theaters, a lot of new theaters have opened in the area that have pure digital screens and sound systems, and they cost the same.

Chompie's is the best New York Deli in the valley. Then again, there really isn't very much great competition. But it's still great food.   The menu is filled with the classics that you'd expect to find in any New York Deli. It's all fit to be eaten at any time during the day.  The prices may look steep at first. But wait until you see the portions. It'll be your lunch for at least two days!

$2 Tuesdays. Sign me up.   For a second-run theater that doesn't have a gimmicky theme, this really is as good as it gets. Pollack Tempe Cinemas is a great place to catch a movie and still get the theater experience. It's even better than a couple of first-run theaters in the valley that I've been to.  Everything about the place reminds me of the movie theaters I used to frequent as a kid in the 80's. The theater may not have stadium seating or an amazing sound system, but you're paying a fraction of the price to see a movie in a big, clean auditorium, so why complain. The life-size figures of movie characters add a fun vibe to the place, and they actually encourage you take your picture with them. Concession prices are on par with any movie theater.   I'm a big movie lover but, like a lot of people, I've switched over to Netflix and Redbox for the majority of my motion picture viewing. But if I'm home on a weekday summer afternoon and there's a movie that came out a month or two ago that I know I want see, why not check it out for just a few bucks?   Heads up to the never carries cash crowd... No credit or debit taken at this joint. Make sure there's some paper in your wallet.

In the mood for Mexican and somewhere different, we found a $30 for $15 gift certificate for Jalape√±o Inferno on localdines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  A great deal.  It made a meal for two half price.  Even better; It turns out this place is one of those great family owned strip mall restaurants that valley residents should be more aware of.  The setting: We didn't eat in the dining room.  But from what I saw, it was quite spacious, and had a fairly formal setting for a causal family place.  The patio is big and if you sit farther back, you'll be on the other side of a pond setting between this restaurant and Jade Palace.  It's a nice touch.  The food: The chips and salsa are awesome.  There are two types of chips in the basket.  One is a traditional tortilla chip; the other is very crispy, more like a wonton.  The salsa is pretty mild, but very flavorful.  A great way to start any meal.  Upon telling the server it was our first time here, he ordered us a free tamale.  It won best of Phoenix (I'm guessing in the new times) so they're pushing everyone to try it.  It's really good.  We also ordered the chicken and steak fajitas for two.  Delicious.  The steak had quite a kick to it, something very spicy in that rub.  Also props to Jalape√±o Inferno for giving both plates a generous scoop of guacamole.  Most restaurants are really starting to cheap out on it.  Overall: The service was great.  The food is excellent.  Jalape√±o Inferno is a wonderful place to eat.  Get the localdine (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) for a good deal, then enjoy a good meal!

Sauce may not have the absolute best pizza in the valley, but it's certainly up there!  We started with a chicken, pine nuts, tomato and gorgonzola salad.  Heavenly.  The salad was not too heavily dressed, and the cheese really complimented it quite well.  The salad itself is big enough for two people to split, and comes with a roll.  If it were my meal alone, I would've been quite satisfied.  We also had the rosemary potato pizza.  Very thinly sliced potatoes, spinach, feta, and some sort of olive mixture.  It was a little tangy and oily, but everything tasted so fresh and come together quite nicely.  Whomever created this pizza knew what they were doing.  Sauce is not really making a big deal about it, but there's now a thicker wheat crust available.  It's still quite thin, crunchy and delicious.  In addition to salads and pizza, sauce offers paninis and pastas.  It's a semi-service order at the register and your food is brought to you style.  This location gets quite busy during lunch, but only gets a small dinner crowd on off nights.  Prices may seem a little high, but the portions are perfect, and quality is fantastic.

The Rolls are fantastic! My girlfriend (who loves Sushi even more than I do) says that SakeBomber has the best in the valley, and she may be right. Since she's the expert, we went with some of her favorite signature rolls, and a cucumber salad. All the picks were top notch. If you like your food with a spicy kick, go for the Playboy roll. It was awesome. The prices are very reasonable and it also wasn't too crowded.  We arrived just before 7:00 on a Friday night and were immediately seated.  While the food is fantastic, the place itself is full of negatives.  The good news is none of them are big enough to stop me from coming back, but here are some of them:   The first question by the hostess after asking how many are in our party was 'will you be drinking tonight?' Turns out she cards you, then gives you a wristband. While I can understand that later at night (during reverse happy hour), I'm not a fan of having to eat my dinner at 7pm wearing a cheap piece of paper on my arm.  SakeBomber's decor looks more like it's trying to be a Sushi bar.  Not quite the upscale look most go for, but they went for the poor man's try.  That may actually be a plus now that i think about it.  You can dress down at this Sushi bar and not feel out of place.  They also don't take American Express (my card of choice). Who doesn't take AmEx in this day and age?

If you need an in depth review of Target you're either living under a rock, or in very high prestige. Either way, I can't help you.   This location is big, spacious, clean, and well stocked. There's plenty of employees roaming around if you need to ask for help.   However, it does suffer from that same strange phenomenon that all Targets seem to suffer from. There's 20 registers, but only three are open, and there's always a manager just standing around and watching. How about opening up a fourth register so I don't have to wait to check out?

My cat only hates two things. Being in the car and going to the vet. That's the whole reason I started taking him to the Scottsdale Cat Clinic. It was just a couple miles from home. Turns out it was great choice.   The Scottsdale Cat Clinic always seems to have an opening when I need to make an appointment. It's very clean with absolutely no hint that you're in a vet's office, and the staff is very friendly and efficient.   The prices are also no more expensive than any other place.  My cat dislikes the poking and proding process, but they manage to get him through it as fast as possible. Every time he needs something extra, they're very good about explaining why he needs it, and how it will help. My cat also is overweight, and I was given suggestions of different foods I can buy at the pet store instead of first trying to sell me a prescription food.

I'll have to admit that my experience of the state fair is a lot different from most. Some coworkers and I were able to get free parking and passes to the fair. We also work early hours, so we went in the afternoon on Friday during "happy hour." A lot of rides and games were discounted during that time. I was there for about three hours, and only spent about 10 dollars!   For us, it was a wonderful way to waste a couple of hours.  I know it's not realistic for most families, but if you're able to go on a weekday afternoon while things are cheap, it's a whole lot of fun. There's plenty of fun little rides, all of which threw off my equilibrium. The games are the usual assortment of carnival stuff. Try to do something that's usually harder than it looks to win a stuffed animal that probably isn't worth what you pay to try to win it. I won a stuffed monkey on one of them!  There's also some great people watching.  I don't know what it is about events like the state fair, but you seem to get an amazing assortment of every kind of person that Arizona has to offer.

Cost Plus isn't really my scene. While it has a lot of cool home decor, and imported food and drinks (with a really random wine selection) that are hard to find, I don't really fancy this kind of place. Probably because I'm a guy. It's just a nice combination of three or four other chains, conveniently located in one setting. So, why a five star review? It's because my girlfriend is a big fan, and every time I walk into this store I'm blown away by just how awesome the customer service is.   Every Employee at Cost Plus appears to be legitimately happy with their position. All of them stop what they're doing the instant they see a customer near them, ask if you need help, and maybe point something out. Normally, this annoys me because it's a store policy and feels forced. But for some reason it works well here. And when I was looking at a wooden giraffe statue to buy my girlfriend as a gift (we had seen it on a previous visit and thought it was cool), out of nowhere one of the guys told me about how it's hand carved, and that there's some in bigger and smaller sizes, etc. Then, as I carried it back to my car, another employee whom I had talked to in the store, was coming back from his break. He stopped me in the parking lot to tell me how much he liked it and gave me a similar spiel. That's pretty impressive. If I were him I would've ignored me (why bother talking to a customer while on break).   I don't know what you're doing to make your employees so good, Cost Plus. But please keep it up!

Desert Ridge, Jr is good for what it is. An outdoor mall in Tempe where a couple of major stores, a lot of small ones, and few decent places to eat and drink all come together. Tempe Market Place is the perfect spot to go when you need to go to a couple of stores, but don't want to run all over town. You can even hit up several traditional mall stores, but manage to run in and out much quicker than at the traditional malls. Parking near the The District can be a pain at times, but there almost always spots near the major stores along the outside.   I also highly recommend Tempe Marketplace as a good spot for a cheap date night. Between Dave and Busters, the live music on Friday and Saturday nights, the other bars and restaurants, Mojo, and even the Harkins, you can easily spend a couple of hours entertaining someone at TMP.

I don't really know the difference between a good dry cleaner and a great dry cleaner,  but I do know a bad one.  Cambridge Cleaners is certainly not a bad one.  Prices are comparable and listed on the store's Website.   It's not the cheapest, but it is a better deal than many of the other dry cleaners in the immediate area.  I got a suit dry cleaned ($5 for both the jacket and pants) and six shirts laundered ($12).  Both the dry cleaning and laundry were ready by 4pm the next day.  Same day is available for dry cleaning if you get there early enough.   When you walk into Cambridge it looks the same as every other dry cleaner I've been to.  A counter to drop off and pick up clothes, a big automated rack filled with clothes, and a view of all the machines in the back.  But it doesn't hurt that the staff is very nice and the registers are up to date with scannable printed tickets.

I was expecting to walk into a little fast food dive.  To my surprise, this place is an actual full service restaurant.  It's still kind of a dive, but I was pretty shocked to have a hostess seat me, a waitress serve me, and a bar with a random waterfall-like display for food at the prices that I saw online.  A pleasant treat almost as good as the food.  My only disappointment about my meal is I ordered the the tiny torta.  I had the ranchera del pollo; chicken, guacamole, chipotle mayo and cheese.  Very good, and perfect for its price at $7.25, but when I saw waitresses carrying the ridiculously stacked tortas, I have to admit I was hoping mine would be at least close to those.  But I should have known from the short description and cheap price that I was going to get the tinny-tiny sandwich.  My brother ordered a Del Rey.  This awesome monstrosity of a sandwich is stacked with just about every breakfast item you can imagine.  He usually eats healthy, but he enjoyed every bite he was able to take of it (although this was was one of the big ones and he could only manage half).  One thing kind of bugs me for some odd reason.  Potato chips as a side seems kind of random.  I know that tortas are sandwiches, but why isn't a mexican place serving tortilla chips?  Just wondering.

A fantastic organization!  For less than 20 dollars Bountiful Baskets gives you a wonderful variety of locally grown produce. If you're willing to pay more, you can get an organic basket. My girlfriend and I order from them every couple of weeks.  She even volunteered one weekend and we ended up with more food than we knew what to do with!  Pickups are are early Saturday morning in random spots throughout the valley.  We go to Arcadia Park at 8:30am.  It's a little crazy looking at first.  The line can look really long, but they're so well organized that it moves in just minutes!  There are some big negatives about Bountiful Baskets... You have to place your order by around noon on Tuesday and you have no way of knowing what you're going to get until you pick it up on Saturday morning.  This has made it tough during weeks when we're low on Produce (I don't want to buy a head of lettuce on Thursday if I may end up with another on Saturday).  I also find that some baskets will end up being less thrilling than others, but so far it's been worth the risk.    Bountiful Baskets also a lot of food, so make sure you have at least one other person to go in with.  If you don't, you'll be throwing a ton of good stuff away.

This is one those "hidden gems" of the valley. Since it's not a chain and it's located in central Phoenix (at Central and Missouri), A lot of people don't know about it. But for my money, it's the best Italian food in Phoenix. I first discovered Aiello's a few years back when I worked a few streets away and they catered a lunch. Since then, I've had their food several times, but a couple weeks ago I actually ate inside the restaurant for the first time. The dining room experience was wonderful. It has a very pleasant atmosphere, and almost feels more upscale than the place actually is (a TV above the bar seems a little out of place, but I won't complain about a chance to catch a game while eating). I had their special that night, which was a roasted chicken ravioli in a white sauce. My only complaint was the white sauce was unnecessary, and a traditional tomato sauce would've been fine (but I think more people are fans of white sauce than I am). All of the times I've had food from Aiello's, I've been more than satisfied. Also, If you happen to work or live by the place, I recommend trying their "backdoor pizzeria." They bake up to 50 18" pies a day for carry out only. My coworkers and I bought a few one time, and they were excellent.

Made a return trip to Aiello's last Friday night.   Having loved the food so much over the years, and enjoying the dining experience so much on my first real visit, I decided it was the perfect spot to introduce my parents to my girlfriend.   (If you're wondering, they were very impressed with both the food and the girl.)  I'm surprised to say that it was even better being there on a busy night! Joe Aiello spent most of the time walking around and saying hello to all the customers. In the minute or two he stops by your table to see how everything is going, he's as entertaining as any east coast Italian you'll ever meet.   I'm even more impressed with the food on this visit. Now that I was with a bigger group, It was more entertaining watching everyone struggle through the menu. It's so hard to pick something when everything sounds so good (and not a single meal disappointed).

Going to PV Mall is like visiting your grandmother in a nursing home; It's nice to see the grandma you've loved your whole life, but no matter how well the visit goes, there's something depressing about the experience.  The mall just feels neglected.  It's not rundown by any means, there just isn't anything there to be excited about.  The few times I've been to PV mall (and not just to eat at a restaurant or grab something at an anchor store) I usually end up meandering around and wondering what I'm doing there.

Golden Spoon is so much better than all the self-serve frozen yogurt shops in the valley.  It's the original of the modern "fro-yo" craze in the valley, and remains the best.  Not only is the yogurt more flavorful and more solid, but you also get a lot more for your money.  Golden Spoon charges by the size, not the ounce, and the employees are very generous about the amount they pour into your cup.  They have no problem letting you sample flavors, and they mix however many you like.  And unlike the self-serve places, the yogurt doesn't look like a giant glob in an oversized bowl by the time you sit down to eat it.  The only negative is that you may be dealing with a line during busy hours as you wait for the employees.   And yes, the plastic spoons are colored gold.

I'm tremendously disappointed with Over Easy. This is the type of breakfast dive (even featured on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives) that I'm usually in love with. I've heard such good things, but thanks to less than stellar food and underwhelming service, Over Easy feels like it's quality is under medium.   With a free Tuesday morning and a $20 for $10 gift certificate from Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485), my girlfriend and I decided to skip the usual eggs and/or cereal breakfast, and give Over Easy a try.   My girlfriend ordered an omelet with chicken, peppers, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. First problem with the omelet; it wasn't an omelet. Omelets are supposed to be light, fluffy, and folded. This came out as just a big scramble. The next problem; they used raw onions instead of caramelized. She sent it back, and explained that she hates raw onions. When it came back, it was clearly obvious that the cook simply caramelized some onions and threw it in with the original omelet. So the raw onions she doesn't like were still in the alleged omelet. It also comes with potatoes on the side. The potatoes were pretty mushy, when they should have been crispy. She could've sent it back again, but what's the point? After just a couple bites, she gave up on it.  She also had an Over Easy Ice coffee. There was nothing special about this specialty coffee. Tasted like Folgers with cream and cinnamon. No taste from the cardamom and mint that was supposed to be in there.   I had the Selina. It's a breakfast burrito. Not bad, but not anything special. Again, the potatoes (which are inside the burrito) are mushy, so there is no texture to it. And none of the ingredients taste fresh, so it seemed like something I could've microwaved up from Fresh and Easy.   We also had the 1/2 order of Caramelized banana & pecan brioche French toast. I was truly expecting something mind blowing, and it was anything but. While it kind of tasted like a bananas foster, it also tasted like it could've used another minute on the griddle.   They had no problem taking the omelet off the check, but it took forever to get that check. We were also kind of surprised that a manager never came by to see how everything was after we sent food back. I left stuffed, but disappointed; my girlfriend left unhappy and hungry.  The tables being right on top of each other don't really help. We could easily see and hear that the other couple sitting behind us was also having issues with the food and service. It also probably isn't a good thing that the people next to us could hear us talk about how disappointed we were. An open kitchen probably isn't the brightest idea, either. We could see quite a few obvious healthcode violations.   With the Local Dines certificate, our total came to about $5 dollars with tip. That's pretty much the only way I'd recommend going to Over Easy.

I enjoy browsing at a book store, but not buying from one.  It always amazes me that these places manage to stay in business anymore.  Especially after my experience today.  I saw that a new book I wanted came out today.  I checked Amazon to see what its price was, then I checked Barnes & Noble's web site to see its price.  The "online" price was the same, and the web site offers a "pick me up" in store, but it takes an hour to pick up.  So I decided since I live less than 10 minutes from Tempe Market Place, I'd head over.    Guess I should have called.  It turns out the online price only applies to the the web site, and if you choose the "pick me up" option, you end up getting charged the store price.  At least that's the impression the clerk has left me under.  The only way she justified it was getting the book same day, and not paying for shipping.  I wasn't in the mood to hold up the small line gathering behind me (like most big retail chains there are several registers, but only one cashier).  So I decided to call it a waste of 20 minutes of my day. Actually make that 30, I'm writing this review and ordering the book on Amazon.

Since I'm rarely in this part of town anymore, I'll do all my fellow Yelpers a favor and let them in on a nice little secret of mine. Because this Costco is located inside Christown mall, the gas pumps are hidden in the back. A lot of people have no idea that the pumps are there, and it's rarely if ever busy!   Another nice thing. The usual Costco "food court" is outside the front of the store and inside the mall. That makes it easy for nonmembers to get their $1.50 hot dog and soda, or the pizza slices, or whatever else it is that you desire from the usual choices. Other than that, this is pretty much your standard Costco. Although the parking somehow an even bigger pain since you also have to put up with the traffic that hits up this lousy mall.

This is a great little Pizza place. I cannot comment on the restaurant itself because Little Chicago offers free delivery, so I have only ordered food from there. But the food itself is great.   Their specialty is Chicago thin crust. While it's not quite as thin and crispy as a thin Chicago pizza, it's still a lot better than what most places try to pass off. They also have wings and subs on their menu, but I haven't tried those.   It's going to cost you a little more than a chain pizza place, but it's worth the price. Way better. Plus it always feels good to support a local business. While I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to try Little Chicago, you should give it a try if you live in the south Scottsdale area.

I just found my go-to delivery pizza! As if I didn't already love Little Chicago Pizza enough, I decided to give its Chicago Beef Pizza a try.   If you grew up near Chicago, and love Italian Beef, then this is your pizza! The thin crust pie is topped with Italian Beef, Sweet Peppers, Onions, and Giardiniera. It's literally the sandwich with cheese and tomato sauce instead of au jus. The small 12" is just $13.25. I was only planning on having half and saving the rest for later. Instead, I ate the whole thing while watching football.   Da Bears are playing this Thursday night. If I don't go out to watch the game, I may be ordering this again.

I'm about as cliche as it gets when it comes to being a guy and hating shoe shopping.  It's boring.  I only buy footwear based on necessity.  I have virtually no style.  I can't stand funky looking sneakers and usually end up with plain and simple black dress shoes.  I also try to buy the cheapest pairs possible.  This is what makes DSW perfect for me.  There's actually a good selection of men's shoes.  There are plenty of athletic, hiking, dress, casual and flip-flop styles to pick from.  Many of the designs are simple and conservative.  When I walk in looking for a pair, I almost leave finding something that I am happy with.  The random coupons they send in the mail if you join their club are also quite nice.

Driving home from dinner and in the mood for something sweet, my girlfriend hit up her iPhone and searched "desserts."  We just happened to be passing near Indian School and Hayden to get to the Loop 101, and Scratch came up on top.  In a 'why not give something new a try' mood, we checked to see if it was open at 8:00 on a Wednesday night, and to what would become our joy, it was.  We walked up to the dessert counter, and took a look at a marvelous selection of pastries.  We decided to grab two and head home.  We went with the Opera.  A chocolate cake with coffee cream covered by a hard chocolate dome.  Quite good.  We also had the Mogador.  A chocolate raspberry cake.  Also delicious.  To our surprise this little place is more than just a bakery.  It's a full blown french bistro.  A great cafe selection of sandwiches, salads, and breakfast items; along with a full dinner menu.  There's also a very intimate ambiance.  While there's not a whole lot of room in the dinning room, it doesn't feel too cramped.  The tables are also set up very nicely, it almost looks like your at a wedding.  I'm going to have to come back and give the entrees a try!

I stop by this location every now and then on my way to work on weekends. That pretty much means I'm too lazy to cook a good breakfast, but want something more than cereal.   I've never had the major issues other people are yelping about. Perhaps things have improved since then. I find that If you stick to a bagel and cream cheese, all is well. But (and I find this the case with most Einsteins) if you try to order anything hot, you're about to get what tastes like an over priced frozen microwave meal.

A little pricey, but if you love yourself a good Chicago-style italian beef, hot dog or polish, then Luke's is the place for you!  I loved Luke's growing up in Chicago, and I love that there's something very similar in the valley.  The hotdogs come on a poppy seed bun.  "Everything" includes mustard, tomato, peppers, neon green relish, pickle, and celery salt.  No ketchup.  Just like a tried and true Chicago hot dog joint.  The italian beef is awesome.  Make sure to include the peppers if you want it done right.  On the randomness factor.  They serve RC Cola.  I think Luke's is the only place in the world, let alone Arizona, that still carries RC.

Very high quality for delivery chinese food.  I could have Red House come to my door every night, and be a very happy man.  I had the chicken lo mein.  A wonderful comfort standby.   With one bite of the noodles I was sold on Red House.  The taste and flavor aren't really that much better than any other restaurant, but Red House delivers that taste and flavor without drowning the meal in the sauce.  My girlfriend ordered the steamed chicken and vegetables from the weight watchers selection.  She added a side of brown sauce just so she could make it a little tastier, but keep it healthy.  It's nice to see a chinese place with healthier selections.  I can't say I have seen the inside of this restaurant,  but I'm not sure if I ever need to.  The food came to my door in less than a half hour and was still pretty hot on delivery.  Prices are really good, too.  With a side of brown rice this meal was only around $20.

Cafepino is a cool little bit of everything.  Part cafe, part wine bar, part italian restaurant. and part coffee shop/bakery.  If you're willing to splurge on slightly overpriced but good food, I highly recommend it as a good spot to get a meal or a snack before hitting up the movie theater next door.  My fianc√© and I were just looking for a light meal.  We both had sandwiches.  The sandwiches come with both fries and a salad.  The salad is in a small glass bowl, which is a great to keep it all on one plate, but not the hot sandwich and fries with the cold salad.  The salad also contains mixed greens and arugula.  Way better than some cheap iceberg lettuce side salad.  The fries are perfect, crispy, and not salty.  I had the french dip, she had a chicken sandwich, both were good.  The restaurant is big.  It's more or less divided into the bakery/coffee bar and the dining room.  THere's also a nice patio.  My only complaint about the service was the server (who I think he was actually the owner) was a little aggressive in the beginning).  Not in a bad or impolite way.  He just a little pushy about asking what specials we wanted to hear about.  They have entire menu of specials.  We barely had sat down and looked at it, so it was awkward, and confusing.  After that, everything was pleasant.  All the desserts that Cafepino had on display look amazing.

While Mill Avenue remains a shadow of its former glory, there still are some great spots for grownups to have a good time.  La Bocca Urban Pizzeria & Wine Bar is one of those places.   I enjoyed a great Happy Hour and meal with a group of couples before walking down the street to Gammage for a show.  The restaurant has a nice modern hipster feel.  The tables have a bit of a picnic table feel to them, but not the cheap kind).  There's also a great patio that is on the alley side of the restaurant, so diners won't get pounded by the sun on a hot day and won't have to put up with too much of the Mill Avenue crowd.  The menu is exactly what you'd expect to find.  A satisfying mix of pizzas, pastas, salads, and bites, many made with ingredients from local vendors.  My table split a med plate (hummus, babaganoush, peppers, cheese and pita and flat bred.  The hummus wasn't the best in the valley, but the babaganoush was phenomenal.  We all had a variety of pizzas and salads.  I personally had the truffled mushroom.  Awesome first slice, but the over use of truffle oil eventually made hard to finish.  One friend checked in on Yelp and we received a free dessert.  We went with a warm white chocolate macadamia nut cookie (made with Sweet Republic's vanilla bean ice cream).  A perfectly baked little "pizza cookie."   La Bocca is also coming to local dines (https://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  $30 for $15.  That will be a worthwhile deal when it's available.

Proof that quantity doesn't trump quality, no matter how good the deal is.  $20 for all you can eat sushi is an impossible deal to pass up.  But take my advice and spend an extra $10 to $20 somewhere else, eat less, and be happier.  The rolls at Mido are infused with much more rice than necessary for the consumer, but just enough that the restaurant saves money on the expensive protein and fills up the customer faster.  The fish is also not very good quality.  Want to avoid the rice?  You can get a massive sashimi starter if you ask.  Don't.  It is the worst pieces of fish I've ever had.  Also mind boggling are the rolls that are on the regular menu that are not on the $20 deal.  Many of them are cheaper than the al a carte orders of what's on the all you can eat menu, but for some reason, they won't let you have these without the up charge.  Probably because they looked tastier than what's actually served.  Having said all that, I really wasn't surprised.  What was I expecting when I was paying so little?  But what really got me down was the service.  The staff is friendly, but horribly disorganized.  I was with a group of 11 and we ordered on three separate tickets.  We figured that they would bring our orders on plates that coordinated with those tickets.  We figured wrong.  They brought everything out on big boats with little rhyme or reason as to what was placed on what tray.  With some confusion, we had to ask or just taste in order to figure which roll was what.  We then explained to the server that some in our group had dietary restrictions so it was important for our next round of orders that we got we ordered on the ticket we ordered with, so that someone didn't accidentally eat something they shouldn't.  The server seemed fine with that, but when we made our second order, they once again just made a big mishmash out of it.  Thanks for listening to a simple request.  One thing that was pretty fun about Mido was the music and lights that play when there was a birthday.  Once I finally figured out what was going on, it was a lot of fun.  Way better than an annoying birthday song by the staff.

It's not everyday when you can describe a restaurant as 'different' and it's a good thing.  But, Ling & Louie's is different from what you expect when you go out for chinese, and that's what made dining there a wonderful experience.  The food certainly isn't "authentic" american chinese, but it certainly is fun.  Here's a rundown of the food my party of four spilt:  Louie's Loaded nachos. Wonton chips with cheddar-jack cheese, chicken, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, hoisin BBQ sauce, wasabi sour cream and "asian" guacamole. Delicious.  I highly recommend trying this appetizer.  Honey Walnut Chicken Crispy chicken and mushrooms in a creamy honey sauce with candied walnuts. Awesome!  The chicken was not too heavily breaded, the sauce was sweet, and the candied nuts were an unexpected treat.  Mongolian Beef. Pretty much your standard order.  This one is perfect for someone just looking for typical asian.  Not bad, but not special.  Beijing Duck Noodles Duck with noodles and vegetables. A good try, but not very good.  There was only a small amount of duck hidden in the dish.  The duck also wasn't very flavorful.  I wouldn't recommend this one.  There's so much on the menu that looks different, interesting and good.  If you're looking for asian, but are tired of the same old, same old, then give Ling & Louie's a much deserved time.  And if you're looking to save a few bucks, Ling & louie's is on local dines (https://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) with a $30 for $15 gift certificate.  But a word of warning, it's a popular one that sells out fast.

I'm 30.  That makes me at least five years too old to be on Mill Avenue to bar hop on a Saturday night (unless you're a transient).  Although I have to admit that I enjoy stopping by every few months for the nostalgic value.  It brings me back to my college days at ASU even though most of the places I frequented back then are gone.  Mill is a great place to go get something to eat.  Maybe even hit up a bar or two after a football or basketball game.  But if you're no longer of college age.  You may want to avoid it at all costs.

You can find Queen Creek Olive Mill's stuff at stores all around Arizona, but it's definitely worth taking the drive out to the far east valley (at least once) to see the farm with your own eyes.  They even offer a quick tour of the mill for just $5.  You won't see too much, but you will learn that there's more to the process of making extra virgin olive oil than you ever imagined.  It would probably be best to take the tour during the fall and winter months, when they are harvesting the olives.  QCOM's olive oils are nothing short of amazing!  A two cup bottle may seem a little pricey at first glance, but when you try it, you'll know you're not tasting the cheap stuff from the grocery store.  Even better, there's a little bar in the back of retail and dining area where you can sample all of the olive oils, vinegars and tapenades.  The only disappointment is the lack of bread.  All QCOM offers is a little shot cup.  A sign says that it's because they want you to experience the pure taste (but they'll gladly sell you a small piece of bread if you want it).  Lunch at the cafe was delicious.  My girlfriend and I weren't too hungry so we decided to split a panini.  We had the Manzi.  Chicken with fontina cheese, basil, sun dried tomato.  It also has QCOM's parmesan tapenade and white balsamic and herb crema.  It also comes with potato chips.  We also split a s'more bruschetta.  Honey mascarpone and nutella.  A fantastic dessert.  The food filled us up for the rest of the afternoon.  If it's a nice day, I highly recommend eating outside.  It took well over an hour to get from North Phoenix to QCOM.  I really can't imagine going out of my way to check it out again anytime in the near future.  But like I said, it's worth at least a onetime checkout.  If you have any visitors in town, and are looking for a way to entertain them, take them out to QCOM.

In need of a new refrigerator, we decided to check out the local shop before hitting up the big box chains.  We're glad we did.  Everything about the purchase at Spencer's was simple and pleasant.  The salesman, Paul, really knew his stuff.  I sold appliances a long time ago at a Best Buy as a part-time job.  While I admit my training was minimal, I know enough about appliances to spot someone who knows less than I do.  He showed us some economical models, moved up to the better stuff, and just for kicks showed us the top of the line models.  We quickly determined that we could get a lot more fridge for our money than we had planned.  He spent a ton of time with us even though it was very obvious we weren't going to buy it that afternoon (we told him upfront that we were still trying to work things out with the home warranty company).  We also left the store feeling confident that he gave us the best price we could get.  It took a few days, but a simple phone call was all we needed to do to finish things up. Delivery, install, and the price of a stainless steel waterline (recommended) is only $50.  The fridge was in our house two days later (we waited an extra day because of the fourth of July).   A quick, smooth and painless process.  If you get the service plan, Spencer's actually owns the company that does the repairs.  It's not an outsourced job like the big box stores do.  I know I'll head to Spencer's again when I need to upgrade the rest of my appliances.

Sweet Republic lives up to (and surpasses) its hype.  I love ice cream.  And I really love this ice cream.  In the mood for something sweet, my girlfriend and I decided to finally check the place out.  We arrived around 6:30 on a Wednesday night.  It was pretty empty at the time, which actually made the trip even better.   The girl at the counter was really nice, and not only did she encourage us to try some samples, but she actually made recommendations of just things to give a quick try.  Everything (even the flavor I didn't like) tastes incredibly fresh.  She also brought the bowls out to us.  A nice little touch of service.  We went with a pair of Sundaes; The toffee banofe (if it's the best ice cream Alton Brown has ever ate, then I had to give it a try) and the turtle.  The toffee banofe deserves the title of best thing I've ever ate. Vanilla bean ice cream, fresh bananas, toffee whipped cream and caramel.  It's salty-bitter-sweet goodness.  If I could eat this everyday, I would.  The turtle was also amazing.  The chocolate, caramel, and nuts all mixed together perfectly.  While not as good as the banofe, it was still phenomenal.  Sweet Republic's prices aren't exactly cheap, but your sweet tooth will thank you.  If you're going to indulge, it might as well be this good.  Worth every penny, and then some!

Duke's is the top place in Scottsdale that my friends and I like to hit up to watch a game, or just grab a drink and bite to eat. The place is huge, the food is priced well for a bar, and there's almost always a decent beer special.  In addition to several TVs placed around the bar, there's plenty of pool tables, dart tables, and shuffleboards to keep everyone entertained.   The menu is big for a bar. The odd, also very good, part about that menu is the salad selection. Duke's has two pages of its menu dedicated to salads. While not something you'd expect from a sports bar, it's nice to know that there still is a healthy selection I can choose from while watching a game.  Another cool feature is Duke's "No DUI Car."  It'll take you to your next destination.  How can you not like that?!

Many people have recommended that I try eating at The Keg, but the thought of yet another upscale chain steakhouse was kind of a turnoff.  The food is usually great at places like this, but the lack of uniqueness is a bit a of put off.  While I won't say that The Keg offers anything more spectacular than rest, the service was awesome.  A big group of us celebrated our friends' engagement at The Keg.  Two servers handled 16 people in spectacular fashion.  Drinks were flowing, food was always on the table, no orders were screwed up (quite rear with a group this size), and they even separated the checks by couple without a fuss, and the Keg did not automatically add a gratuity to the check (while I understand the practice, I prefer a server actually work for their tip).  Most importantly, my steak was good, and not overpriced.

I'm really glad I took the drive down to CarMax.  It was a simple, no hassle, way to see what my car was worth.  I looked at KBB and had an idea what a dealer would offer based on past experiences, but why not have an actual offer in writing?  The process couldn't be any easier.  I made an appointment (which did not appear to be necessary).  I met with Frank who looked at my car and left the keys with an appraiser.  He showed me the inventory of cars they had available while my car was inspected (never pressing me to take a look at anything).  When my car was finished, it popped up on his screen, and he showed me how much they would pay for it.  It was more than I thought and the offer is good for 7 days.  While I didn't end up buying or selling my car with CarMax, it was nice to have a backup plan and not be hassled in the process.

A fantastic little locally owned dive in South Scottsdale. I can't count how many times I've driven past George's, but I never had a desire to stop in because the strip mall it's located in is pretty shady looking. But then I read all the good reviews and decided I had to check it out. I'm glad I did.   The menu (which is posted on the wall, and takes up a lot of space) is huge. In addition to the pitas, there are pizzas, sandwiches, pastas, burgers, platters, and appetizers (both Greek and American). The very friendly girl at the counter wasn't even able to tell me what the best items were, but that's because a guy sitting just inches away started to rave about everything. I decided to go with the Original Gyro (hey, the place is call George's Famous Gyros, after all. It's $6.75 and comes with a salad or fries (I went with the salad). I also tried the Baklava since the raving customer told me it was the best he's ever had.  The Gyro was phenomenal. As good as any Gyro place I've ever eaten at. It's all from Chicago, and you can taste it! It looks small at first, but you'll be surprised at how much meat the pita is filled with. I recommend paying the extra 25 cents for extra sauce. The Gyro is so stuffed with lamb, that you'll appreciate the flavor it adds. The salad is pretty big, but it's pretty much just a standard Greek salad. The Baklava was great, but pretty small even for it's $2.25 price. I would also suggest that George's drop the salad or fries and charge a dollar or two less for the Gyro a la cart. I really didn't want either, and would've preferred to save the cash. The wait for my food also felt a little long, but its probably because most of the food was made fresh, so I can live with that. I got my money's and taste bud's worth, and then some. I'll definitely be back at George's Famous Gyros to see what else is good here.

I like booze.  Total Wine & More stocks a lot of booze.  I like Total Wine & More.  The selection really is amazing.  There's nearly an infinite variety of wines, beers and spirits.  Total Wine also stocks a pretty decent amount of local craft brews and wines to pick from.  Plus, there's a neat selection of minibar size bottles of popular brands that I have not seen anywhere else.  The prices are pretty good, and unlike BevMo, you don't have a club you need to join to get Total Wine's lowest price.  Total Wine also has wine and beer tastings, classes, and other events throughout the month.  It may be the big box store of alcohol, and I'm not sure how knowledgable the employees are about their product as they would be in a small wine shop, but the prices and selections are hard to beat.

I'm really surprised at how blown away I was by J. Alexanders. It's a chain that's very similar to Houston's, but there's something that feels unique about it.   I went with a decent sized group on Christmas Eve (eight people). My girlfriend and I were the first to arrive, and the hostess told us that the table was ready, and we could sit if we wanted to. It seems like it's getting more rear for restaurants to do that, they usually force you to wait at the bar. We still chose to have a drink at the bar, but I still appreciate being given the option.   There were some negatives with the table. They didn't have a great way to seat eight people. It wasn't uncomfortable sitting at a table meant for six with a seat at the head and foot of the table, but it was strange that there were two or three empty tables right behind us. The reason they couldn't move the tables was obvious. It's too dark in the restaurant, and we wouldn't have been able to see anything if they moved the table around. Management was really nice and apologized about it, but they probably should brighten the place up a little bit.   We all split a spinach queso dip. The dip itself was awesome, but the chips are mediocre. Tasted like they were out of a cheap bag. The cool part was they gave us more chips without asking so we could finish off the dip. I had the ahi tuna, which was fantastic. there's a light sauce under the fish, which I wish there was more of on the plate. My girlfriend had the chicken milanese. It's fried with bread crumbs (something I'm usually not all that into), but still was good. If it wasn't for the fact that I could barely finish my plate, I would've finished her's. I don't recall the rest the table's meals, but there didn't seem to be many complaints. One person thought her beef was a little too salty, but not enough to complain. We finished up with a piece of chocolate cake It's served with a scoop of ice cream. Really rich and really good!

This wildflower has the look, feel, and [most importantly] delicious food as any other in the valley.  The space is a little smaller and tighter than most of the other locations I've been too, but it does have some outdoor seating to make up for it.  What really sets this location apart from the others is that it shares an open wall with the book store next door.  I can't explain why, but it really adds to the ambiance.  My only complaint is the parking lot, which is something that Wildflower itself cannot help.  The shopping center is packed with some big stores and restaurants, and barely has enough spaces to accommodate a Saturday afternoon lunch crowd.  Oddly enough, I've noticed this problem that a couple of other Wildflowers.

I've heard good things about Sushi Roku, but I also heard it was quite pricey. That kind of made me hesitant to try it out since there's so many sushi places in Old Town Scottsdale. But last weekend I had dinner there, and it's definitely worth a try.   The atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant inside a W Resort in Scottsdale. It's hip and trendy. If you hate the Old Town crowd, you may want to avoid this place on a Friday/Saturday night.   The staff is super friendly. We had to wait a few minutes for our table (even though we had a reservation), so we hit up the bar. The bartender was really good about recommending some of their specialty drinks, and explaining what was in it. When we did get to our table the waiter was really good about guiding us through their menu.   This place serves a lot more than the standard rolls you find everywhere else.  We had a Toro and Jalapeno roll. Excellent. Exactly what it sounds like.  A garden roll. Really good, it had a Mizuna sauce (think spicy mustard) which really enhanced the flavor.  And a Crunch Spicy Tuna with Avocado. I was a fan, and I'm not usually too thrilled by tempura.   The fish was all fresh and fantastic. Prices were a little more than most places in the area, but nothing to complain about. I would recommend anyone hit this place up with a group before heading over to the bars and clubs in the area.

The food is fantastic, but the portions are disappointing.  You're paying for the quality of the ingredients at America's Taco Shop.  The food is not that expensive, but you're going to need to order more than you think you need to if you want leave feeling full.  Just be ready to spend a lot more than you thought you would at this dive.  I had the carne asada burrito and pastor taco.  I love that there's guacamole in the burrito, and the caramelized onions are great.  The burrito is fantastic, but a little smaller than I'd like for $6.  There is an XL option for $1 more.  Maybe I should try that next time.  The taco was also really good, but also small for $3.  All sides, including chips and salsa, are going to cost you extra.  My taste buds were certainly satisfied.  The food's quality is superior to any of the upscale fast food burrito chains (it may even be better than many full service restaurants), but you'll get a lot more for your money at those other places.  Your options for everything is steak, pork, or veggie.  I probably should have asked this while I was there;  But what does America's Taco Shop have against chicken?  The restaurant is small.  It does feel a lot like a little cantina somewhere in Mexico. There's very little room inside.  The patio seems like an okay spot, but I wouldn't want to be inside or out on a hot summer day.  The parking situation is really bad.  The lot is tiny.  Your best bet is to skip the lot and just find room on the neighborhood streets.

A great idea built that was built at the wrong place at the wrong time.  CityNorth was supposed to be that urban environment that Phoenix is desperately lacking.  An all-in-one place where you can live, eat and shop.  Big things were intended for this spot of land near the Loop 101 and 56th street.  That was announced and construction began back in 2007.  We all know what happened next.  Thanks to the bust.  No one was interested in living in overpriced luxury condos.  Major retailers weren't interested in opening more locations only minutes away from their established stores, and just a few [mostly] high end restaurants and bars decided to stick around with a couple of speciality shops.  While the places on High Street are quite nice, there's very little reason for people who don't live in the area, or who aren't staying at the JW Marriott across the street, to check it out.  There's also no fountain or lawn area for people to just relax and chill like at other outdoor malls.  The architecture is not esthetically pleasing.  There's no upbeat atmosphere in the tiny strip of buildings surrounded by a big parking lot that was intended to be more.  There also isn't any type of a market (with the exception of the monthly farmer's market), meaning if you did live in CityNorth, you still need to go down the block to Desert Ridge for a bulk of your shopping.  Kind of defeats the purpose.  Unfortunately, CityNorth will just have to continue to limp on until things finally turn around.

I think this spot must have lost its Mojo.  There are only a handful of flavors to choose from and none of them stood out.  All but two of those flavors were fat-free, but we'd never have know if we didn't ask.  You'd think it would be posted along with the flavor.  There's also a very serious lack of toppings at this location compared to some of the others.  I already hate that the yogurt is always soft at these self-serve yogurt places, but it was really bad at this Mojo.  When my girlfriend pulled the lever for the chocolate it came out very soupy.  The girl at the counter told her that it always comes out that way.  If that's the case, the manager should probably look into getting that machine fixed.   On the plus side, the sample cups are left up front, so it's easy to test a flavor without having to ask.  The storefront is set up nicely considering it's so small.  If you're looking for something to satisfy your sweet tooth, and happen to be in City North, then Mojo is an alright place to stop into.  But I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to eat at this Mojo.

Meat.  A whole lot of meat.  Is there really anything else I need to say?  Vegetarians and vegans may just want to skip this restaurant.  For those unfamiliar with the concept.  Fogo de Chao is like a buffet that comes to you.  For about $50, servers on carts move about the restaurant and will serve you a cut of whatever they are carrying.  It's not the best or most seasoned cuts you will ever consume, but you will not leave dissatisfied or hungry.  There is also a pretty big "salad bar" that will get some greens and starches on your plate, but it's really not all that great.  Fogo also caters well to bigger groups.  My party of 15 had no problem being promptly seated (with some arriving well before our reservation) and served.  I highly recommend dining at Fogo with a group of carnivores when you have something to celebrate.

These gourmet pizzas are anything but humble.  We split a caesar salad and a marinated tomato & arugula pizza.  The pizza was awesome.  The arugula complimented the sauce and cheese quite well.  The quality of the ingredients was worth the $12.95.  If you think that price is too much for a pizza that size, you can always order Domino's.  I happen to prefer to pay extra for quality.  The salad was good.  There was nothing special about it.  Standard caesar.  A pretty cool feature is the pizza "bar."  Humble Pie has an open view of its pizza oven with a few seats in front of it.  The restaurant was slammed on Friday night, but there were a pair of open seats there, so we opted to eat at the pizza bar instead of waiting 20 minutes (or sit outside in the cold).  It was pretty amusing to watch the cooks make the pizzas.  The happy hours and lunch deals look really good.  Humble Pie is right down the street from my new home.  I have a feeling I'll be stopping in quite often.

I'm very unimpressed with this location.   I prefer to avoid Paradise Bakery, and hit up other sandwich spots for lunch. I find their food good but a little overpriced. But today, I decided it was convenient to stop by Tempe Market Place on my way home from work, and I wanted a sandwich, so why not?   I realized right away that this PB has a smaller menu than some of the others that I've hit up. That was an instant minus. I don't go to Paradise often enough to notice something like that. I settled for a Chicken Artichoke Panini. It was mediocre at best. On the plus side, it comes with a chocolate chip cookie. PB's cookies are a 100/10.   I'm also not a fan of the set up of this location. If you don't have a table and/or are getting something to go, the only place to wait for your food is a small area in the middle of restaurant.  It's extremely awkward, and you always feel like you're in someone's way.  There is one other plus I need to mention from a previous trip.  I once went in before work and was wearing my security card on a lanyard around my neck.  The cashier thought I was a Tempe Market Place employee and gave me a 10% discount.  How nice.

I got to thank my fellow Yelpers for finding this place. I had a craving for sushi, and I've recently begun a quest to try more new places. And when a place with a name like Sushi Time averages four stars, I had to see what it was all about. And, I was not disappointed!   It's not the best rolls you'll ever have, but Sushi Time is on par with most places in the valley, and A LOT cheaper! Not only are the prices low, but from 6pm to 9pm (close), it's happy hour. Buy a specialty roll, and regular rolls are half off. You also get free hot Saki with your beer. For about $30 We got two beers and Saki (beer only comes in small bottles, but why complain, the Saki wasn't good but it was free), Alaska rolls (really good, but could have used a little more of the mustard sauce), spicy tuna rolls (very good, definitely had a spicier kick than most sushi bars), and spicy salmon rolls (decent, but didn't do it for me).   The restaurant was empty. My girlfriend and I were one of only two couples there at 8:00 on a Friday night. One other person did come in to pick up a carry out order, but that was it. It may seem strange to people that Sushi Time is in a strip mall and is a quick service restaurant (you order at the register and they bring you your food), but at these prices for this quality, It's worth it. A great place to start your night, especially if you're heading to Mill Avenue or Tempe Market Place. The staff was also very nice, and very accommodating.  It's at Baseline and Rural, near Whole Foods and Jimmy Johns. I actually used to live right across the street from there. If I still did, I would be eating at Sushi Time all the time. Being in Scottsdale now, It's still worth the drive if I want sushi and want to keep the cost low.

I've got nothing bundt good things to say about Nothing Bundt Cakes.  The lemon bundt-tini was delicious.  A perfectly moist and lemony cake, with a decedent cream cheese frosting.  Loved it.  The perfect desert for two.

As far as self-service yogurt shops go, this is probably one of the best.  The yogurt actually comes out of the machines pretty thick and hard, which is a lot more than I can say about most of the competition, and each flavor has a pretty good taste.  The Oatmeal cookie is awesome.  Tastes like the real thing.  There's also a pretty good variety of toppings.  There are still quite a few negatives.  Tasting cups aren't left out, so you have to ask an employee for samples.  There's only one serving cup size.  Which means you end up with a glop, and deceptively more yogurt than thought you were pouring.  The price per ounce isn't listed anywhere, so you need to ask someone, or just be surprised when you get to the register.

For those who are not familiar with this british speciality, a cornish pasty is a sandwich baked into a pie-like crust.  It's a lot of like a hot pocket, except it's good.  And this restaurant serves up an amazing cornish pasty.  It also doesn't hurt that Cornish Pasty Company has an authentic british pub ambiance.  I had the Oggie, which is a pretty traditional pasty.  Steak, potatoes and onion.  Give it a minute before taking your first bite.  Trust me when I say it comes to the table piping hot.  For just $8.50, it's a pretty good little meal.  Need more?  There are some good sides and salads for about $2 to $5.  The beer selection (tap and draft) is awesome.  I did not partake in dessert, but what I saw at other tables looked amazing.

I'm already not the biggest fan of the self-serve frozen yogurt fad.  It was unique a little more than a year ago when I first stumbled upon it, but now it's growing tired on me.  The variety at this Mojo is awful.  There's only a handful of choices, and only three or four of them seem to rotate.  None of them were particularly good on my last visit.  The yogurt itself is also very soft (a common problem at these self-serve places).  I will give the place credit for being very clean.  The topping bar is well stocked with most of the standards.  Mojo has a perfect location at Tempe Market Place.  If you happen to be there and need a treat, stop in.  If you need to drive out of your way, there's an infinite number of places with this concept that I would recommend heading to instead.

The food at this Pita Jungle is as fantastic as any of the others. But there's a big difference between this one and others I've visited. The atmosphere.   Most Pita Jungles tend to have a more bohemian look. Very artsy, but not very chic. The Desert Ridge Pita Jungle instead goes for a very contemporary look. As my girlfriend puts it, this is the "yuppy" Pita Jungle. There's a bar with big screens above it playing sports in HD. The lights and decorations all look like they are at a chic new hot spot. But the food is just as wonderful, and gets to your table just as quickly as all the others.  And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that!

My world has been turned upside down, at least in terms of donuts.  I cannot believe I'm raving about a donut shop, but Lamar's really is better than anywhere else.  The most delicious morning sweet treats in the valley!  The more traditional "donuts with a hole" are 89 cents.  About the same as any donut shops.  The "specialty donuts" are $1.89, which may seem expensive, except they're the size of at least two donuts.  One is more than enough for anybody.  Oh, and for the reviewer who is complaining about hydrogenated oils...  It's a donut.  It's bad for you either way.  Might as well use whatever makes it taste best.

What can I say that no one else has?  Postino is a cool little wine bar.  It's also one that you don't need to dress up in black like a starving artist or Scottsdale nightclubber in order to fit in.  Postino has a bright and modern ambiance and awesome food.  The bruschetta is fantastic.  We tried (from best to not quite best) the white bean with tomato, smoke salmon pesto, brie apple and fig, and mozzarella with tomato and basil.  I could have kept eating all of them until my stomach exploded.  The flavor combinations were amazing and the ingredients were fresh.  If you can't find one that you like, you my need to have your taste buds examined.  We also split a chicken and mozzarella panini.  Delicious.  The sun dried tomato mayo and the arugula are a tasty complement to the protein.  The sandwich is as fresh and well prepared as the bruschetta.  Add a glass of wine and you have the perfect little meal.

It's a self-serve frozen yogurt shop.  That's really all there is to say.   You get a choice of what kind of yogurt you like, you can top it with whatever toppings you like, and they charge you by the ounce.  It's pretty good, and only costs a few bucks for a decent (semi-healthy) snack.   If you like frozen yogurt, you'll like Mojo.  If don't, you'll hate it.

"Welcome to Moe's!"   I usually hate when an establishment has some sort of forced greeting like this, but for some reason, I love it at Moe's. While the food is not better than chipotle, or Baja Fresh, or most other fast food burrito chains, Moe's has a couple of things going for it that I really like.   The big one is a different option than most. You can order the Triple Lindy, which gives you the choice between sour cream and guacamole. Since I dislike sour cream and love guacamole, this is perfect. Most other places (Chipolte) overcharge for gauc. Moe's on the other hand, charges you if you want both (the Home Wrecker) or the cheap option is one or the other (the Triple Lindy).   Moe's also has a pretty good selection of cheap beer!

If Phoenix had a true city life, Gallo Blanco would probably be one of the most popular spots in the valley.  Instead, it's a pretty randomly located restaurant in the lobby of a pretty randomly located hotel, in a pretty random part of town.  The Saturday night wait was expectedly long, but it allows you take advantage of the beauty of the Claredon hotel.  It's a pretty hipster hotel along the lines of the W in old town, but with a lot more space and not surrounded by all the trendy restaurants and bars.  The pool is pretty cool surrounded with "waterfall windows" and lights that change color.  There is also a lounge area on the roof of the building which offers a surprisingly pleasant view of the valley.  Grab a drink from Gallo's bar, give the hostess your phone number so they'll call you when your table is ready, and enjoy.  The fare is gourmet mexican street food.  That usually means smaller portions at bigger prices, but Gallo gives you your money's worth.  The chips and salsa are excellent.  You could fill yourself up on those long before your entree makes it to the table.  The chips were fresh, hot, and not greasy.  The salsa was also fresh and delicious.  If you need some heat, ask for the bottles.  Service was great.  The waitress did a great job selling the food on the menu.  There was always some one coming by to refill waters, grab a finished plate, or bring us more chips.  My only major complaint is a need for a few more heaters on their patio.  We were seated outside, which didn't sound so bad when we arrived at 7:30, but after waiting a little more than a half hour to be seated, it sure got chilly in the corner where our table was.  And for some added entertainment.  Hit up the men's room.  Trust me.  You'll have a quick a laugh once you see it.

This place is great for a drive through car wash.   About once a month, I take my car here for the Obsessively Clean wash. It's $10, you get a car freshener, and it's almost as good as any full service car wash in the valley that I've taken my car to. Clean Freak also features two cheaper prices (a $5 and $8 wash). All three include a cheap shammy to wipe down the inside of your car with.   One of the big kickers that I enjoy is their free vacuums. Most gas stations and convenience stores charge you about a dollar to use their's, so this already makes Clean Freak's price a better deal than some of the gas stations down the street.   Sure, I could do a better job for cheaper at a self-wash. But when I'm lazy and don't feel like getting out of car while it's being washed on a hot day, this about as good as it gets.

If you look closely at the sign, you'll notice the price is for regular is only if you use cash.  When you pull up to the pump there is a sign that states there's a credit or debit surcharge.  This price makes this Shell station more expensive than the already overpriced Circle K just across the street.  I expect the outdated credit/debit surcharge from Arco, or a small gas station, but not a Shell.  You can save yourself a couple of dollars by getting off the highway before/after the tunnel at 7th Ave.  Stations both north and south of the I-10 are cheaper on that street.  The plus sides of this station is that there's a lot more pumps than at most stations in the downtown area.  There's also a car wash.  There is just a tiny little spot in the middle with a cashier and a few convenience items, but no real store presence.  Maybe this Shell should build a store on the property, so it can increase profits by selling overpriced sodas and candy, and start charging less for gas.

I don't know how anyone doesn't love an Apple Store! It's like a technology playground inside. You may have to pay more for Apple products, but the customer service is second to none. Let me explain through my story as briefly as I can....   My girlfriend's iPhone 3GS died. It worked fine at 3:30pm Friday afternoon, but when we got home and she took it out of pocket at 8:00pm it was dead. She called AT&T to look into what she could. She argued with a customer service person (they were worthless since her contract wasn't up for renewal for 10 more days.. she pointed out that it would be cheaper to cancel her plan and get a new iPhone 4 through Verizon, and they still wouldn't budge). They even blamed Apple for not being able to be more flexible, but we soon learned that was simply passing the buck.   The next morning we called Apple. Even being on hold with Apple is a better experience. The music is a pleasant mix, mostly from the 60's and 70's (a lot of Beatles!), and a recording consistently told you the exact number of calls ahead of us. We spoke to someone who arranged an appointment at the Genius bar, told us they'd look at it for free and find a solution even though the phone was past its warranty and she didn't purchase AppleCare. We even ended up running late, and it turns out it's really easy to schedule and reschedule appointments on the store's web site.   At the bar, we happened to get the same guy we spoke to on the phone. He was obviously one of the better people in the store (I wish I could remember his name because he deserves high praise), because other Geniuses kept asking him questions to help their customers. He found that there was nothing he could do for the phone, so he called it a battery swap, gave my girlfriend a brand new iPhone 3GS, and swapped out the SIM Card, so we wouldn't have to renew her contract. That was just $80 (vs the hundreds that AT&T wanted to charge).   In addition to this, I walked around the store and enjoyed looking at all the products, and talking to several employees about them. The place was slammed but there were dozens of employees standing around, each of them either showing a group how to use something, or just striking up random conversations with customers. All of them look genuinely happy to be working there (unlike most retail stores), and none of them pressured you into doing anything else other than browsing.   With the exception of an old iPod, I don't actually own any Apple products at this time. But I've been looking into getting a new laptop, and now I know I'm getting a MacBook.

Did a Chicago Bears fan really drive all the way out from Desert Ridge to Chandler to join some friends for happy hour trivia at a Packers bar?  Yes I did.  And even though I was not a fan of the green and yellow decor, I still managed to enjoy a fun Friday night at Stadium Club.  The happy hour is pretty good.  For about $10 (including tip) I had a giant glass of Fat Tire and an order of sliders.  The sliders were really good.  Not too greasy and well complemented on a toasted brioche bun.  No complaints.  Except for all the Packers decor.

I don't know when exactly it started, but it feels like self-serve frozen yogurt shops have popped up all over the valley like an infestation. And in a world filled with this fad, it's a shame that there aren't more place like Golden Spoon. Not only is the quality of Golden Spoon better than the self service places, but you get so much more for your money (both yogurt and toppings).   This place was clean, the service was fast and friendly. Prices are very cheap, and there's a big range in sizes. Stick to the smaller ones, believe me, they still give you a lot. Another tip, make some creative decisions. My girlfriend had them mix pumpkin pie with graham cracker. It really tasted like real pumpkin pie.  And if you've never been to a Golden Spoon before... Yes, the plastic spoons are gold.

I don't know where the word 'Rustic' comes from in the naming of this restaurant.  There is nothing rustic about the food or decor.  But that criticism aside, Rustic Cafe was a nice little spot to get a decent breakfast.  I ordered the 2 egg breakfast with a half waffle.  For only $6, you get a decent meal at an extremely great price.  While the food didn't amaze my pallet, it certainly wasn't bland.  But am I really expecting a cook to reinvent over easy eggs, toast, hash browns, and a waffle?  It's a meal just about anyone can cook.  But the batter used for the waffle didn't taste like a mix, so that's better than I would have done at home (I would also have to get a waffle iron).  The generic individual jam and country crock margarine packets felt a little unnecessarily cheap.  Then again, the meal was cheap.  The portion size was perfect.  I was certainly filled up for the morning.  I would say breakfast at Rustic Cafe is more of 3.5 star experience, but I'm willing to round up since it's a small local establishment.  I wouldn't recommend anybody go out of their way to eat breakfast at Rustic Cafe.  But if you live close, it's worth a try.

Smashburger isn't bad. It's definitely quality for a fast food chain. But much like 5 Guys, Fatburger, and any of the other nondrive-thru burger joints, Smashburger just doesn't justify it's higher price tag (although this one isn't excessively expensive).   I had the 1/3 pound classic Smashburger and sweet potato smashfries. The burger patty itself was pretty good, not greasy at all. The egg bun is awesome. The special sauce is lame. I'm very sadden to say that Smashburger is the only place that's ever served me bad sweet potato fries. The portion is pretty small, the fries didn't stay warm for very long, and putting rosemary (an herb I generally enjoy) on them was awful.   The place is clean and the employees are very friendly. I think Smashburger puts a little too much effort into trying to look like its something better than it really is. I agree with the reviewer who said "good food costs." However, I paid a little more than $7.00 for a burger and fries. Not bad, but there's so many options in the ASU/Mill Avenue area (where for just a few more dollars I can have better food), that I think I'm going to have to pass on Smashburger next time.

It's a pretty good quick service version of the Valley's best Mediterranean restaurant. This Pita Jungle has a drastically reduced menu that is perfectly suited for Fashion Square's food court. It's also probably one of the healthiest food choices in the mall.   I was on a shopping mission that the mall after work and got pretty hungry, so I hit up the food court for a quick bite. I had the Philly Chicken Pita. The food was ready quick, was very reasonably priced for the portion size, and had an excellent flavor. It's not quite as tasty and fresh as what you'd expect from a regular Pita Jungle, but it's certainly better than most fast food. However, The pita was way too soft. The wrap was falling apart in my hand even with the aluminum foil still around it.   The set up is pretty good for a small food court spot.  You order on the left side of the counter, then move over to the right side to pick up your food when it's ready.  It's pretty much the same as the Paradise Bakery that's also in the food court, but somehow it doesn't feel as crammed.  Most of the menu has pictures of the food, the rest is written in a big enough font that's easy to read.  I don't find myself in the mall all too often, and I wouldn't head to this Pita Jungle as a destination. But if I'm at Fashion Square and feeling hungry, I'd happily stop by again.

What a great little family owned restaurant!  I actually never had authentic Korean food before, and now it's something I'm craving to try more often.  Not only is the food fantastic, but the owner is the bomb.  My friends who eat at Red Kimchi all the time call him "Hot Stuff." I don't know the origin of the nickname, but he happily responds to it.  He's cool as hell, and as we closed the place out, he turned on some Asian hip-hop and took a couple shots with us!  The set up is extremely dated.  It looks straight out of the 80's.  But it doesn't really matter.  Red Kimchi is not designed to be a busy and crowded place.  It's a quiet little spot to enjoy a fantastic meal.  We came with a birthday party of about 15 people.  They were super accommodating, even though we were probably a much bigger group than they're used to entertaining.  One person's order was forgotten, which is always lame, but bound to happen.  It's just the owner and a woman (I'm assuming she's his wife, but I could be wrong).  One big tip when coming here for the first time.  Google maps shows you that Red Kimchi is on Scottsdale and Weber.  Can't tell you why that is, but the place is actually in the Papago Plaza on Scottsdale and McDowell.

It's a cool little unique place. My friends and I met there for a happy hour, but that's really all Sleepy Dog is good for.   It's in a really bad spot for the type of bar it is. Sleepy Dog is a coffee shop version of a Microbrewery. It only deals in its beers. It has short hours, and it's only the type of place that you you'd stop in before you start your night, but it doesn't serve food (they do have complimentary popcorn and pretzel bowls, and people are welcomed to order food from other nearby businesses) and you have to drive on to get to another place (just what you need after drinking). The sign is also really small and hard to see from the street (a usually busy University Drive).   My girlfriend and I decided to split a sampler. It had seven or eight of Sleepy Dog's beers. A few of them were alright, but the lighter beers were way too light, and most of the dark beers were low on flavor. There were a lot more options to choose from, but I would assume what's on the sampler should be the best stuff, which made us unenthused to try the rest.   I would stop back at Sleepy Dog if someone wants to have a another happy hour there. But I would never go out of my way to head back there.

If I'm going to settle for frozen yogurt over ice cream, I better enjoy it.  When I have Golden Spoon, I don't feel like I'm settling.  This location is on par with the others.  Very clean, with a big variety of flavors and toppings, and a couple of seats for eating in.  The prices may seem higher at first glance, but the servers tend to pour very generous portions.  They also generously load the toppings in the cup or cone.  If you paid 30 to 40 cents an ounce for what Golden Spoon gives you, you'd be paying a whole lot more.  Call me old fashioned, but I despise the self service frozen yogurt concept.  That in itself may be one of the biggest reasons I prefer Golden Spoon to other frozen yogurt places.  Not only are most of the flavors better at Golden Spoon, but there tends to be a wider variety and the machines are superior.  No super soft runny yogurt here.

I didn't even know this place existed a week ago, but now I believe I have found 'the one.'  In my quest to find a good spot to get my hair cut up north, I noticed The One Barbershop in Desert Ridge while taking care of some other errands.  The business has a great website for a barber shop which not only details its prices, but also allows you to make appoints online.  An appointment isn't necessary, but it never hurts to know that if there's a wait, I'll jump to the front of the line.  The One Barbershop kind of has a big chain shop feel, but not in a bad way.  They use big leather chairs, each seat has an easy view of a flat screen tv which they'll happily change to any channel for you.  My barber, Viktoriya, was very friendly, quick, and gave a great haircut.  The hot towel and massage treatment at the end was a nice treat.  I left looking good, relaxed, and feeling good.  While I miss the cheap strip mall barbershop I used to frequent in Tempe, if I'm going to visit a modern shop up this way and pay more than $20 for a haircut, then this certainly may be the one barbershop for me.

Finding a good barbershop is a lot like falling in love.  As you look for that special someone you may hit a few bumps in the road along the way, but when you've found the one, you just know you've found the one.  This shop is the one for me.  I've been regularly coming back to The One Barbershop for about a year and always leave with a good haircut.  The online reservations are easy to make and the 20 minute haircut takes exactly 20 minutes.  I highly recommend Viktoriya.  Her days are limited but she's definitely worth working around.  I'm sure the rest of the staff is just as good.

If you ever have the misfortune of working nights like I do, you will eat more fast food than you care to admit.  Options after 9pm are very limited when you forget to pack your "lunch."  So in the mood for a burger and not having the patience to wait at In-N-Out, and unwilling to eat at McDonalds, I settled on the least of the evils with Wendy's.  I typically just order off Wendy's value menu.  While it's not the extensive 99 cent deals from the '90s, it's still cheap enough to make up for the lack of quality.  But I saw an ad that I just couldn't resist when I pulled up to the restaurant, a pretzel bacon burger.  I may be one of the few people in America that doesn't believe bacon makes everything taste better, but I do believe that everything tastes better on a pretzel bun.  Until now.  The first problem.  I received my order, then drove a few feet away from the window to take a look at what I got but not keep the car behind me waiting.  Although I asked for no bacon, take one guess what was on my burger.  Bacon.  Okay, I just picked it off.  But attention to detail at the drive-thru seems to not be Wendy's specialty.  I've lived in several parts of the valley in the 15 years I've lived in Arizona.  I've also driven thru several different Wendy's, and each location seems to make consistent mistakes.  Order a frosty; no spoon or even a straw (which is worthless with a frosty, anyway).  Ask for no mayo;  mayo remains on burger.  Ask for honey-mustard sauce for chicken nuggets; get barbecue sauce.  I don't have very high expectations for fast food employees, but my bar gets set even lower at any Wendy's. It feels like I always stopped driving thru the nearby Wendy's because of better options and constant mistakes.  The second problem.  When I bit into my burger, I immediately regretted this debauchery.  Flavor-wise and texture-wise, the cheap Wendy's burger patty just doesn't go with the pretzel bun.  The bun itself is pretty good, a firm crust but soft and light inside.  But the mixed greens offer little flavor and lacks the crunch of iceberg or even romaine lettuce.  And I cannot even properly critique the sauce.  I don't know what it was supposed to be, but it's just gross.

This place is really different. The set up is very interesting. The tables are huge with big chairs that look like something you'd find in your grandmother's living room. The booths are also big leather couches that give off the same vibe. But it all comes together in a cool modern kind of way. The chairs are comfortable, but there's big downside. I'm short, so the table was oddly high.   Culinary dropout is also kind of small, so we waited a while to get a table, but once we ordered, the food came out ridiculously fast. But the it was really good, and the prices are pretty low (especially compared to the other places in the Waterfront/Fashion Square Mall area).   The cocktail menu is really impressive. I would definitely head back just to try the random assortment of drinks they make. Their Appetizer menu also has a lot interesting temptations.   I would recommend Culinary Dropout as a perfect happy hour spot. Hit it up sometime with your friends and coworkers on at an early time on a weekday evening.

I'm really surprised to have found a quality chinese restaurant this far north. J. Chen is right down the street from my girlfriend's parents and we all had dinner here last night. The place is set up pretty nice for a little chinese restaurant in the middle of a random little shopping center. A nice water structure at the entrance. All the tables had some nice little decorations. There is a bar off to the side with a huge TV which could be a little distracting, but it had the Bulls game on, so I wouldn't complain. The only thing that is odd is the view of the front of restaurant. It's a little too open for a chinese restaurant, and I could see as the takeout people took orders, and every person who came in and out to get their food. Pretty distracting to me, but this probably isn't a problem for most people.   J. Chen also has a pretty good looking menu, with pretty much all the standards you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant. We had the Orange Beef. It was excellent. The beef was crispy, and the sauce was very flavorful.   Chicken and Broccoli. Light and delicious. Not over sauced.   Sesame Chicken. Well fried and not too over sauced like most chinese places will do with this dish. Only a hint of syrup which had me craving more instead of being overindulged in sweetness.   Kung Pow Beef. While the beef and the vegetables were cooked perfectly, I was disappointed at the lack of heat in this dish. Kung Pow is typically spicy. The menu says it's spicy. We only found two chilies in the entire plate. No heat.   Another thing to point out is the tea. The hot tea at J. Chen has a wonderful light citrus flavor making it so much more tasteful than most places. Loved it.

It's nice to see that not all of the Hi-Healths in the valley are closed, especially this location. It's big and spacious, well stocked and clean, and the employees are very knowledgeable and friendly.   I probably had one of the best customer service experiences of my life here. I was running in just to buy a supplement after work. Not being sure where they stored it, and not being in the mood to explore, I walked up to the register in the center of the store and waited behind the customer being helped (Yes, there is a man in the health store not afraid to ask for help). Not even a minute later, a woman who had followed me in asked if I needed help. Turns out she was an employee who hadn't even clocked in yet. I told her what I needed and she grabbed it for me and rang me up. Although I didn't need it, she gave me the rundown on how it worked and what I should and shouldn't do while taking it. The obvious suggestive sells during that pitch were a bit unnecessary, but knowing that she knows her stuff made me feel a lot better about shopping at Hi-health.   Hi-Health has always been my choice for supplements and other health needs over GNC. It just always feels like the employees are better, and the stores are always bigger and better stocked. I don't think I've walked into a Hi Health that was out of what I wanted. If you need something to enhance your work out or diet, Hi Health is the store for you.

I don't really want to brag about needing to run out to a see a doctor, but I really do want to recommend this Nextcare.  I don't have a primary care physician, and I don't want to wait at an emergency room.  So when I need medical attention for a non life-threatening situation, a place like this is where I go.  The desk staff is friendly and wise enough not to ask "How are you doing?"  I'm in an urgent care.  The answer can't be good.  They just say hello and ask "Do you need to be seen?"  The answer to that is also fairly obvious, but nevertheless a much smarter question.  I filled out the forms and went from the waiting room to an exam room in just a couple of minutes.  As the other reviewer mentioned, everyone is professional and prompt.  I felt very comfortable with the staff.  And other than the wait to see the doctor (which we all know is typically long anywhere), I wasn't stuck at Nextcare for a very long time.  I was diagnosed, given a prescription, paid and left in a little more than a half hour.  The one negative I can point out is the suite is a little dated.  The building is nice, but the actual office feels old.  I've been to Nextcares which don't use paper anymore, and are a lot nicer.  It's not a bad environment.  It could just use a little bit of updating.  But when you're at a doctor's office, that's the least of your problems.  The place is clean and organized, which is all anyone should really need.

I'm not a home decor or kitchen aficionado, but whenever I need something for the house that I want to be a step up from Target (or can't find there), I can always find it at Bed Bath & Beyond.   The store is big, and has nearly anything you can think of. If you actually look hard enough, you can even find some random stuff that you would never expect to find. Prices are very competitive. Not typically the lowest unless there's a sale, but there's always a deal to be found.   The staff is also very helpful. I was once there to buy some place mats and matching napkins for my table. They were one napkin short, and the cashier dug through several boxes in the back to find them. While that's something I know a good store employee should do, I know that it's just as easy to lie and say they're out (Bed Bath & Beyond doesn't strike me as commission based).   For me, the big score is K-cups for my Keurig Coffee Maker. Bed Bath & Beyond has the best selection I've seen at any store. And only charges $9.00 for an 18-pack (about a buck less than most places sale prices).   It's not a store that's really in my range of interest. But for those of you who love home accessories, this is a great place for you.

I know it's the same company, but for those who have never set foot inside, Buy Buy Baby is literally Bed Bath & Beyond; Just all baby stuff. The prices are good. The sales people are nice. The gift wrapping station is a fantastic bonus. And in addition to its own coupons, Buy Buy Baby takes unexpired Beth Bath & Beyond coupons. If you are in need of baby stuff, or looking for a gift, this is a great place to shop.

In the age of credit cards, debit cards, online and mobile banking, I don't find myself going much further than the ATM when it comes to going to the bank.  However;  Once in a great while I do find myself needing to go inside the bank to use a service, or see a teller, and this branch actually makes me miss those good old days of human interaction.  The employees are really friendly.  The kind of friendly where in the couple of minutes it took to withdraw money into a cashier's check, I think the teller and manager knew my whole life story.  I'm not really a conversationalist when it comes strangers, but they always manage to break me out of shell.

This is a solid little Sandwich shop. The people are very friendly and asked a lot about what I wanted on my order instead of just going with what they felt was standard. I really appreciate this, especially since I'd never been there, and don't know what's standard there.   I had a grilled brie. It has ham, brie (obviously), lettuce, tomato, and hot peppers. The sandwich is good and huge. It cost nearly $10.00 alone after tax, but is well worth it's value. I was only able to finish half of it. Next time I go I'll probably opt for the lunch special, a half Sandwich and salad, or soup and salad. I also want to check out some their crepes some time.  There are a few minuses but the food was so good that none of this would bug enough to not come back. The Sandwich club is just south of Indian School on Scottsdale. It's in a high traffic area, and you may have to park a little ways away from it during peak lunch hours. It's also super small, so I wouldn't recommend it for dining in. It also has a very weird set up. You walk in and head to the end of the counter to order, then back to the front to pay. This wouldn't be too bad if there was an organized way to do this, but the place is so small you just kind of get stuck between the people ordering and the people paying.

Oh look, another self serve frozen yogurt shop. There's so many of these places around the valley now that most of them are no different than the others. Unfortunately, this one stands out in a bad way.   I had a craving for something sweet before a coyotes game, so I stopped by Ocean Blue for a somewhat healthy snack. Like other self serve shops, you pick your flavor(s), toppings you desire, pay by the ounce and get ripped off (although the price doesn't look too bad until you compare it to places that don't charge you by weight).   There's a massive amount of sample cups left out making you feel more welcome to take a try than most places. However, the cups are so small that I made a mess of my hands. I tried a couple of flavors. Peanut butter (awful), double fudge (disappointing), and pistachio (decent). I went the pistachio which was light on flavor and texture. It was a lot softer than I'd like my yogurt to be and almost tasted watered down. The toppings all looked good and fresh. I put some walnuts on it, and called it a day.   The place is spacious and clean. The cashier seemed nice, but I really avoided any interaction with her other than paying. This may be some people's spot, but it certainly isn't mine.

RnR is a bar that's nearly open nearly 24-7 (7am to 2am). It seems like whenever you drive past the place there's always at least a small crowd.  The menu changes based on what time of day it is, with the exception of some appetizers.  An amazing breakfast. I had the Amish french toast. It was thick, and served with strawberries and cream. I also had a cup of coffee that was better than anything I've had at any coffee shop! I will definitely stop back in for lunch and dinner sometime.

I made a return trip with my family for breakfast.  The server was very attentive and the food was still fantastic.  Even better, RnR is now on local dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) with a $30 or $15 gift certificate.  A great way to save at this Scottsdale hot spot!

This is a fantastic spot. The dining room itself is fairly small, but there's a lot patio space outside. I'm not too sure how I'd feel about that on a very hot or cold day, but it's great for a temperate night.   The burgers are amazing. Zinburger has a small selection, with a few toppings, and you can add plenty of other fixings for a couple of dollars. I had their special of the week. The name of it already escaped me, but it was topped with guacamole and pico de gallo, and was unbelievable. They also serve phenomenal sweet potato fries.  For desert we split one of their milkshakes. It was creme brulee shake. It was good.  The shakes are 20 ounces, so sharing was probably a good way to go.  The staff is really friendly, and the food came out. fast  The drinks were also refilled on a regular basis, and super quick.

I finally made a long awaited return trip to Zinburger and it was as good as I remembered it! Just the smell walking into the place was enough to let me know I made the right decision to eat there.   My girlfriend and I split a Zinburger (if you're going to name a signature menu item after yourself, it better be good), a chicken sandwich, and an order of the double truffle fries. I absolutely loved the fries. I'm not even that big on fries, but I could have had another order just for myself! The Aioli dipping sauce was amazing. Ketchup would've been an insult to put on them. The server also aware when we ordered that we were going to split the meals, so they halfed the sandwiches, and put them both on each plate. A nice little touch. Both were phenomenal. My girlfriend rarely eats red meat and she enjoyed indulging in her half of the burger. We also split a creme brulee shake for desert. Just as good as it was the first time.   It was nearly 8:30 and we were seated promptly. A little corner table on the patio with the bar. It was a nice spot, but it got a little annoying because it was right by one of the main entrances of the mall's parking lot. Even that late, it was still a little distracting everything I heard a car making a turn just feet from our table. But the food at Zinburger remains top notch.

The Vig Uptown pays up just like the original in arcadia.  It has the same atmosphere just in another up and coming part of Phoenix.  The giant indoor patio has got to be a pleasant spot to enjoy a good meal even if its a hot day in the desert.  The patio and the dining room are both quite spacious.  When you have a sandwich on the menu called best turkey sandwich, you better be able to back it up.  The Vig certainly does.  It really shouldn't be anything you haven't had before, but the pretzel bun takes it to a whole-nother level.  I would like to thank the Vig for helping to prove my theory that everything tastes better on pretzel bun.  And if you want a great deal, you can save a few bucks at the Vig Uptown with local dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  There's a $30 for $15 gift certificate.

I'm not really a big donut guy. But some fried breakfast sounded pretty good this morning. Plus, I work on Sunday mornings, and it always makes coworkers happy when somebody brings in junk food. So I picked up a dozen on my way to work.  Justifications aside, Bosa has great Donuts! These are way better and cheaper than Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts. This is definitely the place I'll stop by when I'm in the mood for the morning sweet treats.  But don't waste your time with the coffee here. It's awful.

Rhythm and Wine is a fun little North Scottsdale gem with some really interesting fare.  I probably would've never heard of this restaurant, much less given it a try, if it weren't for seeing the $30 for $15 deal on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  There's a pretty flashy ambiance to the dining room.  Pictures of classic rock stars are pretty obvious decor for Rhythm and Wine's theme, but the upside down table lamps on the ceilings and walls add a really fun touch.  The menu offers up item named after rock bands, movie stars, and song titles.  The menu is also pretty extensive for a wine bar.  We started with the french onion dumplings.  The menu says that you shouldn't leave without trying it.  The menu gave some solid advice.  What a cool take on french onion soup as an appetizer to share.  The onions were wrapped in a wonton shell, covered in gruyere cheese, and swimming in a small skillet of broth.  A very satisfying start to our meal.  I had the "dixie chicks" marsala.  This may be one of the best chicken marsala dishes I've had from a non-italian restaurant.  The mushrooms and marsala wine sauce were the sweet stars of the dish.  My wife felt it was a little too sweet for an entree, but I am certainly not complaining.  My wife had the chimichurri marinated flat iron steak.  The steak was cooked perfectly, but the chimichurri was way too unexpectedly hot for her.  I took a few bites and it didn't bother me, but I like spicy food.  She likes some spice, but it became too much for her to handle.  After wiping most of the chimichurri off the place, she ate most of the steak, but left nearly all of the covered vegetables.  Chimichurri is not typically spicy.  It would've been nice for the description on the menu to note that they make it that way.  That dish aside, the atmosphere and well cooked food will certainly warrant another visit to Rhythm and WIne in the future.  Especially if it is still on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).

If you enjoy paying extra money to be constantly screwed, then Safeway has an amazingly horrible delivery service that will fill your masochistic need. I think that Safeway Home Grocery Delivery has to be an experiment that is purposely designed to fail so the company can say it tried delivery, but customers made it clear that they prefer going to stores. Because no one likes to have their goods brought to them at home instead of going out, right?  It all started about a month ago: My wife received a promotion for the service and decided to give it a try. As parents with a young toddler, it seemed nice not to have to strap her into a carseat, drive a couple miles, then put her in a shopping cart and hope that she doesn't suddenly have one of "those days" while trying to get food. But it actually turns out that I very much enjoy putting up with the few and far between "those days" with my typically well behaved daughter than order food from Safeway Home Grocery Delivery again.   Our first experience was less than stellar: The driver was more than four hours past the two hour window. Our order also included a box of chicken broth that leaked so it was trashed and refunded. It also included yogurts that were past their pull dates. My wife called customer service and was given $20 dollar credit.  OK, let's give it a second chance: The driver was on time, but several items were missing. Those items were simply removed from the bill. By the way, they were pretty basic things that stores rarely run out of, such as tomatoes and milk. But Safeway did have the courtesy of replacing a nonfat ice-cream with regular version of the same ice-cream. Yes, it tastes better. But no, it's not what we paid for.  Third experience: Don't ask me why we were crazy enough to give this thing another try. The order was on time and correct. But it also included organic whole milk that was delivered on its pull date. That milk is for a toddler. It's also expensive. While I have no problem drinking milk past the date, there was no way we were giving it to her.  Fourth experience: At this point I don't even think I can blame Safeway. Obviously, it's not them, it's us. We naively look past their incompetence and think that they will improve. After the driver once again missed the window (between 2pm and 3pm on a Friday) my wife called to find out what was going on. The representative couldn't get a hold of the driver and get an ETA on when the delivery would happen. We were given a credit again. My daughter and I went on with our day, while my wife stayed at home to wait for the food. By 5:45 we returned home. No delivery. My wife called and was told there was an issue and the delivery would not take place today. She asked if we could get it first thing in the morning, but was instead given a four hour window in the middle of the day. Really? We have to potentially give up most our Saturday to wait on a delivery that was supposed be made Friday afternoon? We canceled the order and will now squeeze a trip to the grocery store (which the order was designed to avoid) into our weekend plans.  My wife wrote a complaint on Safeway's Facebook page. The response was that the post would be forwarded to the delivery team management so they can learn from it. I'm pretty sure they are aware of the situation. We can't be the only people having this experience. So in other words: Thanks for letting us know, sucks that we literally wasted your afternoon, don't expect us to try to make this right in any way.  So all we have right now (since we don't have any food in my house) is a $15 credit to a service that we simply can't allow to abuse us anymore. Thanks for nothing, Safeway.

If you haven't shopped at a Fresh and Easy, the simple way to describe the store is it's like Trader Joe's.  Only Fresh and Easy has a modern feel to it instead of the hippie co-op atmosphere. For being a relatively small store, it carries a very good selection at very reasonable prices.   The thing they're best known for is the prepared meals that are relatively healthy, and only take minutes to heat up.   One of their best features is their reduced priced on perishable foods. Almost everyday you can get a great deal on steak, beef, chicken or fish that's a day away from its pull date. As long as you're not picky, it's well worth it.   The biggest problem I have is with their produce. For a place with "Fresh" in its title. I've notice that fruits and vegetables I buy from Fresh and Easy tend to expire pretty fast.

An quaint little spot to enjoy a pleasant lunch or breakfast.  I'm only aware of a handful of other creperies in the valley, so the uniqueness makes it stand out.  Our server (I'm guessing she was the owner) was outstandingly friendly.  It really felt like she was going all out to make sure we enjoyed our late lunch at her establishment.  We tried two savory and two sweet crepes.  Each was fresh and delicious.  The crepes themselves are a little different, but in a good way.  They don't have the buttery and eggy taste that you get at lot of places.  I was surprised that this didn't disappoint me.  It turns out I enjoyed that it did not distract me from the wonderful taste of the fillings.

A pumpkin patch, a corn maze, a petting zoo, pony rides and the smell of horse poop. What more do you need to enjoy an October outing with the family?  The parking lot looks like a big cluster at first (especially after reaching it from a dirty little road), but after getting past the front entrance it really opens up and there are plenty of spaces to be found.  I can't tell you what MacDonald's Ranch is like if you're going for the horse riding. But if you're going there for some fall family fun, it's as good as any other pumpkin patch around town during the season.

It's hard to judge a restaurant based on a single visit with a large group, but service was so awful at this Chompie's that there is no way I would ever make the drive to meet anyone at this location again.  A friend of mine was in town but only had limited time to meet up, so a group of about 15 people (plus three small children) decided to meet for lunch.  We did the smart thing and called ahead to let them know that such a large party was planning to dine there at 1:30.  We were seated in a "party room" which had a TV, fireplace, and plenty of room, which was nice, but it also was dirty.  Three tables had previous diners' dirty dishes and cutlery left on them.  The floor hadn't been swept.  And, one busser stopped in and cleaned off only one of those table during the two hours we were stuck in there.  So now for the real problem...  We were seated in this dirty room and after a few minutes a waiter came in.  We all ordered food and drinks.  It became very obvious the one server assigned to our group was overwhelmed.  It must have been at least 10 to 15 minutes before we started to see any of those drinks.  I don't know how long it takes to pour drinks for 15 people, but couldn't someone at least bring some pitchers of water and glasses during that time?  Drinks finally arrived.  Then nothing.  It was an hour later when some pickles were brought to the table.  I'm not joking.  An hour later and our meals still weren't ready.  It was 2:30 in the afternoon.  I was planning on being at least getting ready to pay my bill by that time.  Fortunately, none of the kids were complaining, but at least make sure they got their orders in a fair amount of time.  Everyone was hungry.  Neither the server nor the food were anywhere to be seen.  When our orders finally arrived at 3:00, the trays were placed on one the still dirty tables (a few of us noticed, but everyone was too hungry to complain).  The saving grace was that none of the orders were wrong.  The waiter was smart enough to bring free cookies with the bill, but the only reason none of us got a manger and complained was because it was nearly 3:30 and we all had places to go and just wanted to get out.  The one redeeming part of the visit is that the food is the same as every other Chompie's.  Which is excellent.  The ambiance is modern instead of old fashion deli.  But the service was a complete fail.  They knew a big group was coming, if they were unable to accommodate us, they should have warned us.

I'm never disappointed when I eat at a Wildflower.  It's a better version of Paradise Bakery with a feel free to stay all day if you like (but less pretentious) Starbucks vibe.  I also dig that one of the founders of the company emailed me to address some of my critiques of another location, even though the review was generally positive.  It's great to see that they're paying attention to their customers.  There's a great selection of sandwiches, salads and baked goods.  For the sandwiches I think the secret is in the simplicity and quality.  Most of them don't have more than three or four ingredients, but they seem to put together the perfect combination between those two slices of fresh baked bread.  My wife's caesar salad may have been one of the tastiest caesar salads I've ever tried.  This location also has a few cool things going for it.  There are power outlets under many of the booths, making it convenient for computer and tablet users to do whatever they are doing as they enjoy their drinks and meals.  Like other locations, there's the standard lounge near the front of the restaurant that's a perfect place for waiting for take out orders, or for coffee drinkers to hang out in a more open setting.  And this Wildflower also has a private party room in the back, which is also nice if you have a big group.  If you're anywhere nearby, Wildflower Bread Company is certainly worth a try.

The line was ridiculous.  The price is kind of steep for what it is.  The dog is kind of messy because of the way it's made.  But you know what?  I enjoyed it in a way I haven't enjoyed a hot dog in years!  Wow, that sounds kind of dirty.  This really is a unique take on one of the most common American foods.  I passed through the sea of trucks and people that is Food Truck Fridays on a mission to finally try the much yelped about Short Leash Dogs.  I can't say much too much that hasn't already been said.  While the 20 minute wait wasn't too thrilling, it all paid off in the end.  I just went with a traditional wiener, with tomatoes, onion, relish and spicy mustard.  While I was intrigued to try some of Short Leash Dog's specialties, most of the dogs on today's menu contained an item or two that I don't really like, and I wanted to compare Short Leash Dogs to what I am accustomed to the first time around.  Good sausage, good toppings and the flat bread is fantastic.   I would happily join Lindsey F. by tying my leash to the cart and following them around town.  And I didn't even know that I still enjoyed hot dogs that much without a beer and a game!

A great place to go for some laughs! I was there with a group of friends to see another friend of ours perform on Saturday night.   Stand Up, Scottsdale! is a big room inside a restaurant inside a hotel, but that shouldn't stop anyone from enjoying the place. It feels small, but still has a pretty good set up. It caters more to local up and comers, and the headliners aren't all that big of a name, but for the low price they charge, you can live with it. The club has the expected two item minimum, but the drink prices were more than reasonable. Food and drink all come the restaurant, so it's real food and the typical "club" menu at other places.   The waitresses are good, but there's no real system to their service. When we sat down one took our order, then two more asked us what we wanted. They probably should try to do a better job of zoning the tables, but then again I'm complaining about people trying to serve me, so I guess that's not a bad thing. They also didn't do a good job of blocking the shows. We were there for the 10:00 show, but the 8:00 show got out late, and ours didn't start until after 10:30, and it let out around 12:30.  But, it's Saturday night, so that shouldn't be a problem for most people.

Good food in a unique setting with fantastic service.  Nobou at Teeter House offers up a very pleasurable dining experience.  I'll start with the great.  The restaurant is in a more than 100-year-old house in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  There is nearly a perfect feeling that I have been invited inside someone's home for a fancy dinner party.  The staff was fantastic.  Our server, Alexis, was very attentive, friendly, fast, and really knew the menu (or at least was good at selling every dish with a very thorough description about the technique and flavors used to create it).  The presentation of the food is creative and beautiful.   The not-so-great.  The food is served in small portions at a high price.  I wouldn't have a big problem with that, I actually think Americans should be more into tapas eating, except nothing we ordered blew my mind or taste buds away.  Don't get me wrong; everything we ordered was excellent.  The food is perfectly cooked, seasoned, sauced, and artistically plated.  It just didn't have that over-the-top "WOW" factor I was hoping for.  Having said that.  Nobuo at Teeter House is still a place that everyone should try out at least once.  It's an enjoyable place to eat.  It's probably a fun place to go with a small group of friends just to hang out, order a lot of plates and just sample what the restaurant has to offer.  As I said, the price can be a little high.  It took five plates and a dessert to create a fair size meal for just two people.  That came to nearly a $100 tab (with drinks).  But Nobuo at Teeter House is on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485) with a $50 or $25 gift certificate.  Take advantage of the deal and cross Nobuo off your Phoenix restaurant bucket list.

I don't know which is more impressive;  The six days I waited to get my lost bag or the more than one week it's been since I complained and am still waiting for a response.  Awful customer service.  This only happened because I was dumb enough to give up my seat on an international flight for $500 in credit.  I thought I was getting deal.  It turns out I'm a sucker who is going to have to fly this carrier again.

I would think this Post Office would be more together considering it is in the middle of a major industrial and business area.  There's also a massive amount of retail in the immediate area.  But it's always slammed and It just feels like a massive chore every time I stop in.  One of automative postal machines always seems to be down, or the package box won't open, or the mail box inside is jammed.  Also, I was hoping to open at box here at one time, but all boxes are unavailable.  Here's a neat idea for the struggling US Postal Services; IF YOU'RE CONSTANTLY SOLD OUT OF BOXES, INSTALL MORE!  On a positive note; Since it's a block from the major road, it's easy to get in and out, if you're just dropping off a letter in one of the drive up boxes.

This is one of those restaurants that every one in the valley should give at least one try.  An excellent locally owned spot, with a good modern vibe, and serves up great and fresh food.  And if you want to save some cash, there's a great $30 for $15 deal on Local Dines (https://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  I had the Chicken Parmigiano.  I love that Local Bistro has its own spin on such a common dish.  The chicken is flattened and breaded more like a schnitzel, covered with gruyere cheese, and a tomato ragu is served on the side.  Not only is it a tasty dish, but its nothing like the Chicken Parm you can order in any other restaurant.  The only thing that I didn't appreciate was the noise.  Wow, it is loud inside.   The tables are also a little uncomfortably close together, but you won't have to worry about any eavesdropping on you.  In fact, you'll barely be able to hear the people you're trying to listen to.

Mexican food and upscale dinning is a combination that sounds simple but somehow it doesn't always get pulled off well. But, unlike most places willing to give the concept a try, Taberna pulls off the middle ground perfectly. Most upscale Mexican restaurants give you a feeling that they are higher priced places that serve Mexican food. Taberna is well decorated and still feels like a Mexican restaurant.   The chips and salsa were a perfect start. The blue corn chips were perfectly salted and the fried plantains were a unique touch. The salsas were awesome. The hot had a great kick and the green had a good kick plus a great citrus flavor. My girlfriend and I also split an order of empanada as an app. The braised chicken inside was perfectly cooked. The fish tacos use different fish on different.  Friday night was swordfish! It was cooked and cut just right so that you got the full flavor with every bite. I had the special of the night, which was a french roasted chicken, with a stuffed chilies, asparagus and graton potatoes. The sauce was probably the only thing Mexican about it, but it was still great.   Drinks (a margarita and sangria), an appetizer and two entrees came up around 70 dollars. Not bad considering this restaurant ia in an upscale shopping center. Taberna is also on Local Dines (https://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485), so we used a gift certificate to save 15 dollars.

A coffee shop vibe, but a bar set up.  Perfect for me.  Tryst Cafe offers up breakfast, lunch and dinner specializing in locally grown and organic foods.  It's like a diner that serves quality over greasy (not that there's anything wrong with a greasy diner).  I stopped in here for lunch during a busy day of house hunting around Desert Ridge.  Glad I did.  I had the roast beast sandwich.  You can really taste the quality of the meat and bread.  I take my love of sandwiches very seriously, and this is a serious sandwich.  My girlfriend and her cousin had omelets, which they both praised.  If I do get a house in the area, I may be eating at Tryst Cafe quite often.  And if you're looking to save some money, Local Dines has a $30 gift certificate for $15 at Tryst (http://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485).

The taste of Louisiana literally on the go!  Being only a little more than a year removed from a Mardi Gras trip to New Orleans, this truck brought back some fun memories I thought I had drunk away.  Jamburrito's is a regular staple at Food Truck Fridays at the Phoenix Public Market, and on my latest visit to the weekly roach coach festival (I say that lovingly) I decided it was finally time I give it a try.  I had to go with a catfish jamburrito.  In addition to the menu saying it was famous, the uniqueness warranted a try.  Catfish jambalaya wrapped up in a burrito, how do you go wrong with some cajun-mexican fusion?  The catfish is cooked well and the spices are hot!  The hot sauce served on the side only makes the dish better!  The lone issue I had with the catfish jamburrito was the cheese.  Every time I got a bite of cheese and fish together, it just didn't taste right.  Despite the culinary faux pas; For just $8, it comes in a very generous portion which will fill you up for the rest of the day.  I probably should have stopped after eating half, but I wanted to get my money's worth!  Another cool thing about Jamburrito's.  It's not a cash only truck.  They take credit card, and will text you a receipt if you desire.

I don't know if I'm nuts, or Showcase just improved its customer service, but I have to give them big props for my last visit.  I had been sent a coupon for a $20 oil change sometime ago, and since it was expiring on Wednesday, I ran in Tuesday to take advantage (my car was only a little more than 100 miles short of needing a change, anyway).  As usual, I was told it would only take about an hour.  90 minutes later, one of the service managers came over and found me.  Turns out I had a tear in my top engine mount.  The repair was covered by the warranty, so they fixed it for free.  And even better, since they never told me about it, and it took so long, they also comped the oil change!

The food is pretty good but the prices are too high. While the nearly $9 dollars I spent on a Shawarma combo isn't too outrageous, the size of the pita is pretty small, and for a couple more dollars there are several quality Middle Eastern and Greek places close to Tempe Marketplace that are considerably better. There are also many quicker, cheaper, and better options inside The District.   The Shawarma Pita contained well marinated and cooked chicken thighs, fresh veggies, and an awesome sauce. Disappointingly small for the price, but actually the perfect size for a filling sandwich. The fries are mediocre. I'd suggest skipping them and just going for the sandwich (this will save a little bit of coin, too). Paying a little more for quality doesn't bother me, but I can't say this was worth it.  I only decided to check out The Greek Pita because I was already at Tempe Marketplace, and had never eaten there. If you happen to be there and have a craving for Mediterranean food, then by all means give it a try. But The Greek Pita is definitely not a destination eating spot.

Breakfast is the the most important meal of the day and Butters gives its diners a good reason not to miss it!  A fantastic meal in a comfortable modern setting.  The place is crowded but that's not a problem.  The 15 to 20 minute wait goes fast, and the only thing that is faster is the service.  It felt like it was only seconds between when we ordered our meals, and when we received them.  Everything is top notch.  If you're looking for a quick, quality breakfast, look no further.

Oliveo Pizza left a menu on my door a couple weeks back and I figured why not try somewhere new. I'm glad I did. I cannot comment on the restaurant itself since I haven't set foot inside, but I can say the pizza is great. All the ingredients tasted fresh. The price isn't anymore than you'd pay at any decent pizza place, and the taste is well worth its value. The Greek salad we ordered with the pizza was also quite good.   The late night delivery is also a big bonus to this place. Oliveo also has late night specials. Where was this place when I was going to ASU? Oliveo does charge a few dollars for delivery, but the delivery range is massive compared to most places in the area (they go way farther than the typical 2 to 3 mile zone). The menu is loaded with several specialty pizzas that all sound interesting. I will definitely order up from Oliveo again and give one of those a try!

A quick, fresh, and fairly healthy meal conveniently located in the Waterfront.  Zoes is a big step up from most of the options in Fashion Square's foot court, and you'll get in and out of this quick-service spot much quicker than you would at most of the full-service restaurants.  The prices for the portion size and quality of the food is more than fair.  I had the chicken rollups.  Pretty good.  Two small chicken wraps, cut in half to make four pieces, which are about two to three bites each.  There's also a nice medium salsa for dipping which is the perfect compliment to the dish.  I also had a side of brazed white beans which weren't bad, although whomever prepped it went a bit too heavy on the rosemary.

While I wait for the fine people at Chipotle to finally wise up and build a location north of the Loop 101, this one is the closest to my home in Desert Ridge.  With a craving for a burrito bowl, and Chipotle's easy online ordering, I put in my girlfriend and my usual order (which was originally made for another location by our old home) with a single click and drove down to PV Mall.  There's nothing that really sets this Chipotle apart from the others.  It has the typical look and feel of every other Chipotle ever built.  The food is the usual quality I have come to expect from this quick service chain.  My only real put off was that my order was not ready on time.  The confirmation email said our food would be ready by 8:10pm.  I walked in at 8:12, skipped the line and went to register, waited for the person paying to finish, then told the cashier that I was there for my online order.  It hadn't even been made yet.  The staff quickly put it together in less than five minutes, which allowed me to jump ahead of three or four people who had been waiting, but that also means if I just left my home earlier, it would've taken about the same amount of time.  Not the worst thing to ever happen, but it does defeat half the purpose of online ordering.  Having said that, here's a tip for all the people who complain about the long line at lunch time.  This location is right outside a mall surrounded by a ton of apartment complexes, retail centers, and office buildings.  It's going to be busy.  Order your food on chipotle.com (there's also a fax form on the website, or call ahead, if you're old school) and skip over all the people who did not plan ahead.  If they screw up and don't make your order right away like they did with me, they'll drop everything and make it.   No need to feel like a jerk.  You're now just smarter than the other customers who are now mad at you.  You're welcome.

I have come to accept that self-serve frozen yogurt is the new model, but I still despise most of these types of shops.  Having said that, Friomio is probably one of (if not) the best of them.  It not only has a big selection of fro-yo and toppings, but the the few I tried were quite tasty and had good texture and constancy.  Unlike most self-serve frozen yogurt shops, Friomio's yogurt isn't too soft, and doesn't start melting seconds after you put it in your bowl.  I sampled the root beer float and pumpkin.  The root beer float, was perfect for what it was.  Tasted just like a root beer float.  The pumpkin was awesome.  I decided to have peanut butter cup and birthday cake.  I'm giving myself props for a great combo!  The place is huge and clean.  I hate that's tucked in the section of this complex with Wildflower and Hi-Health.  Parking is such a pain in this tiny section.   They don't post their price anywhere, so get ready for possible register shock when you get ready to pay unless you ask.  Friomio offers 20% if you present a receipt from any of the many nearby restaurants.  So enjoy lunch or dinner at one of those places, then stop at Friomio for dessert.  You'll be glad you did.

I lived at the Scottsdale Belle Rive for a year.  It's a good place to live.  Prices are pretty cheap considering it's so close to ASU and Old Town Scottsdale and not a dump.  The pool is really nice.  The weight room is on par with any apartment complex.  Being so close to the loops 101 and 202 also makes it really easy to get around the valley from here.  If you're in a roommate situation or have people over a lot, I highly recommend living on the west side.  There's a lot more visitor spots on that side.  The only negative to that, is you can only turn right when leaving that side, so you have to make a u-turn at Granite Reef every time you want to get to the freeway.  Management is very friendly, but a little flakey.  There's usually only one person in at a time, so every now and then you have to wait on someone.  They also will tell you that they'll have something done for you in a day, but it will take two or three.  But everything gets done, and they knew my name, which is better than a couple places where I've lived.

If a fast-food restaurant only serves chicken fingers, I would have thought that it would serve the greatest fast-food chicken fingers I have ever consumed.  I thought wrong.  Very wrong.  The food that I ate left me pondering the mystery of how Raising Cane's has such a hardcore fan base.  I tried the 3 finger combo.  3 chicken fingers, fries, a slice of texas toast and a drink.    I'll start with the good. The texas toast. It's a massive piece of fluffy white bread covered in butter.  The bread is so soft that it could be used comfortably as a pillow.  But, I wouldn't recommend that because you could choke to death by accidentally eating said delicious texas toast pillow in your sleep.  The bad. Everything else in the box. I appreciate that the chicken wasn't greasy, but it certainly wasn't crispy.  The actual meat was dry and the breading was severely under seasoned.  And whatever that Cane's sauce is supposed be, it's disgusting.  It's some sort of a barbecue sauce and ranch dressing mixture that tastes like an unidentifiable somewhat smokey, somewhat spicy, creamy mix of blandness.  It really doesn't say much when the specialty (and only) sauce a restaurant serves makes its underwhelming main dish taste even worse.  Or maybe that says a lot.  The fries were just standard.  Considering chicken fingers are all that's on the menu, I don't see any reason why I would return to this or any other Raising Cane's.  If for some bizarre reason I end up eating at a Raising Cane's again, I'll just order 10 slices of texas toast and call it a day.

The restaurant is huge.  The beer selection is awesome.  The Food is disappointing.  If I were just going in for a beer and some cheap eats during happy hour or reverse happy hour, I may have have loved Thirsty Lion.  But just stopping in for a meal, not so great.  I had the Green Chii Chicken Sandwich.  Not bad.  Just nothing special.  Slightly messier and soggy than I would like my sandwiches to be.  My Fianc√© had the Southwest Chicken Salad.  Horrible.  The salad was big and looked nice.  But it was mostly cabbage, the chicken tasted like a bag of sliced tyson chicken from the grocery store, the corn was nearly impossible to find, and the avocado didn't taste ripe.  It was almost as much of punishment for me to watch her pick through it as it must have been for her to eat it.  The dressing that came with the salad was fantastic.

After a few return trips, Cold Beers & Cheesburgers really started to grow on me.  I tried more of its burgers, beers, and sides, and I really started to enjoy what CB & CB has to offer.  But, when I ate there last week, everything went down when I picked up the menu.  The prices have been jacked up.  And not only is it more expensive in general, but there is now an up charge for sides other than chips and fries.  Part of what made CB & CB stick out from countless amount of burger joints in the valley was all the side options.  Now, the meal that cost about $10 or $11 a month ago, is around $12 to $15.   The happy hour and daily specials are also not what they used to be.  So to sum it up.  The food is good, but worth the price.  The good news is that CB & CB is still on local dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  You're now really going to want to use the $30 for $15 gift certificate so you don't feel overcharged.

Studio Movie Grill is as good a place to see a movie as just about any other theater, plus the food and full bar and being able to select your seat online are phenomenal compliments.  SMG's ticket prices are equivalent to standard cinemas in the valley, and the food prices are on par with an average family restaurant, so really it's about the same as going to a standard dinner and a movie in the long run.  There's always a deal on Groupon or some other discount site, so it's pretty easy to save a few bucks, as well.  The lobby is has a pretty cool set up.  It feels more like a lounge than a movie theater.  There's a bar and some big couches and tables.  If it weren't for the box office, you'd could theoretically just hang out and would never know there were movies playing just feet from your seat.  The theater has a decent set up as well.  Each row alternates between a big leather chair with a tray table in front of it, or a bar with an office type chair.  I've only sat in the big chairs, which are comfortable, however you will need to lean forward to eat in the dark or risk making a big mess on yourself.  I can't tell you what the office chairs are like.  I would guess it's easier to get, but less comfortable overall.  I only wish the ground were angled more.  Stadium seating is the only thing the auditoriums are sorely missing.  The screen and sound system are digital and crystal clear.

On a warm Saturday afternoon, I was shocked to discover the popularity of OHSO.  The back patio was slammed with customers day drinking at 2pm.  A very good sign for any bar.  The reason this microbrewery may be popular is probably because OHSO serves great beer.  I'm not just talking about what they brew on site, but there's a massive selection of craft beers from other microbreweries in Arizona and from around the world.  If you're looking for Bud Light, do yourself a favor and go to any other bar in the country.  If you're looking for something other than beer, there is a decent selection of mixed drinks.   Having never been to OHSO, I decided I should have one of their own and the Citrus Nitro caught my attention after the server called it a "creamsicle."  What a perfect description of what the beer tastes like.  Would you believe a beer flavored like a creamsicle is delicious?  It is.  I also tried the White Chocolate Ale from the Sonoran Brewing Company in Scottsdale.  Also delicious.  Service was great.  I was with a group of about 15 to 20 people, and the waitress had no problem keeping our tabs straight.  There were also tray filled with water glasses constantly delivered to the table without request.  Something desperately needed on a 90 degree day.  The server also was really knowledgeable about the beers on the menu.

Empty, dirty, and poorly stocked.  That's all I really need to say about my stop into the Einstein Bros Bagels at 90th street and Shea.  It doesn't help that I am not a fan of this chain to begin with, and this location doesn't help change my opinion of Einstein.  My wife and I had breakfast plans that were canceled at the last minute, so we just wanted something quick and easy before heading into a store in the huge shopping center Einstein is conveniently located in.  There certainly wasn't a crowd at 11am on Sunday morning, but that didn't stop the dining room from having a couple of dirty tables and trash cans filled above the rim.  Maybe the employees were busy making bagels since they were already out of several varieties?  No.  At least that's not the impression we were given when we asked if they had anymore of some of the missing bagels and were just told "we're out."  I get that you don't want to overstock, but I don't think our expectations are too high if we hope the bagels we like are in stock just before lunchtime.

I wouldn't expect anything less than a delicious meal if I'm eating at a restaurant with a menu created by an iron chef, and Distrito delivered.  This restaurant cooks up some pretty flavorful dishes and serves up some strong and tasty cocktails.  With a really good $40 for $20 gift certificate from Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485), my dad and I met up for "brunch" Sunday afternoon.  I put that in quotes because it's really just the lunch menu with some breakfast items slapped on.  I bet the pancakes are good, but we were here for the mexican fare.  I ate the Pecado Tacos.  Grilled fish, cabbage, a slice of avocado, and a fried plantain with a chipotle sauce.  It may sound like a fairly basic fish taco, but I sure taste better than anything basic.  The only negative is that you get three normal sized tacos with nothing else.  You may want to order a side to go with it if you need something to fill you up for more than an hour or two.  My Dad had the Torta Milanesa.  A chicken cutlet, avocado, queso oaxaca, and watercress in a big hard bun.  All I have to say, is wow, what a sandwich.  If you're looking for a unique drink, have the Naranja Roja.  It has blood orange liqueur, blood orange pur√©e, and habanero.  You can really feel the kick from the peppers.  The alcohol is poured generously.  My only real complaint is that the service was a little slow.  Drinks took some time.  And after we received the check, it took forever for someone to take it off the table and run the credit card.  But the servers were as friendly and hospitable as can be.

From earrings for valentine's day, a neckless for mother's day, to the engagement ring for my fianc√©, I continually return to Kay at Fashion Square Mall to buy jewelry.  Being a cliche guy, I can admit that I know virtually nothing about jewelry.  Other than a watch, I've never really found a use for accessorizing myself.  But like any man with a wonderful woman in his life, I enjoy giving her gifts, and what woman doesn't like shiny things and precious metals?  While Kay may be another little mall chain jewelry store, the staff eases the anxiety of buying pricy items that I know little about.  The customer service is second to none.  They're very friendly and really take their time with you, even when the store is packed.  They also do a wonderful job of explaining what I am looking at, without making me feel like an idiot (obviously, they specialize in stupid boyfriend/husband).  I always walk away feeling like I got a great gift for a great price.

Who'd have thought that you should have packed a lunch to go to a food festival?  We didn't even bother eating at any of the trucks.  It was so crowded, and the lines weren't moving, that we realized trying to eat (the purpose of going to a food truck festival) would be a futile test of patience.  My friends and I cut our loses short and bailed immediately.  It took about an hour to get through the atrocious parking situation and walk to the entrance.  Even after that, we left after just one quick lap around the festival.  Being charged to enter was robbery.  I'm not even sure what we paid for since every truck and booth was charging.  Someone must have pocketed big from this ripoff.  Thank goodness we used a Groupon to get six tickets for $25.  If I had paid $10 a ticket, I'd be furious.  Long lines are expected at a food truck festival, but those lines should move.

The creator of this concept is a genius!  The Chipotle of sushi.  How did it take someone so long to come up with this idea?  After all, up until sushi became a trendy delicacy in the late 20th century, it was actually japanese fast food.  To navigate through its menu, just think Chipotle.  You pick your wrap (seaweed or soy) and rice (brown or white).  Then pick up to three veggies, your protein, then sauces and toppings.  The prices change based on your selection, but for about $6 to $8, you'll walk away with a pretty generous sized roll.  If you don't know what combinations work best, there's a small selection of "signature" rolls they'll put together for you.  I made a spicy tuna roll with brown rice, jalape√±o, avocado and chili sauce.  Good and hot!  The food itself is decent.  I would rate the quality of How Do You Roll as a couple of steps above a high-end grocery store sushi bar (Whole Foods, AJ's, Fry's Signature, etc).  But, it's not even close to as good as any of the trendy sushi spots in the valley.  It's not cheap.  But considering it's fresh fish, it's not expensive.  If you're looking for a big calorie busting meal, there's just about every other fast food option within 10 minutes of How Do You Roll.  If you're looking for something that's of a higher quality, and can be served in very healthy style (as long as you avoid the mayo based sauces), then roll with it!

I'm letting the word out on one of Scottsdale's best kept secrets.  Calistro California Bistro is a quiet Scottsdale neighborhood restaurant that should be making a lot more noise on the valley's food scene.  Calistro offers an inviting ambiance, a friendly and hardworking staff, and most importantly delicious fare.  The menu is small but it is still difficult to decide.  Everything sounds good.  The food tastes fresh and prepared in-house from scratch.  I had the duck confit tagliatelle.  The duck leg was cooked perfectly and the meat easily fell off the bone.  It was so flavorful that I felt like it was challenging me to chew on the bone like a dog so I could taste more.  The hand-cut pasta was also magnificent and the madiera cream sauce is a perfect compliment.  The meal is also served with an amazing piece of focaccia.  Baked with some delectable herds, the bread would have been fine on its own, but once I dipped it in the madiera, I was in heaven.  My fianc√© had the filet.  She asked for vegetables instead of the mashed potatoes which they had no issues accommodating.  I took a bite of the beef, which was cooked to a perfect medium  Like most of the best places in the valley, Calistro is an unassuming little space in a strip mall.  When you pull into the parking lot of the Hilton Village there is little that distinguishes the restaurant at first glance.  But don't let this put you off, once you walk onto the patio you will know you're in a great spot.  The bar is a perfect little spot to have a drink and keep an eye on a game or whatever else the TV is playing.  It's divided from the dining room by a beautiful wine rack.  Unique art lines the walls.  Calistro is not expensive, but good food is going to cost you good money.  However; there's a great $50 for $25 deal on local dines (https://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) which will get you a great meal and make things easier on the wallet.  Give Calistro a try, you won't regret it.

You cannot beat the price or speed of Hair of the Dog.  This little local grooming shop does a good job and only charges $35 to groom my 15 pound Maltese/Jack Russell mix (prices go up based on the size of the dog).  Hair of the Dog also gets the job done in about 2 hours or so.  That's at least $10 cheaper and and and an hour and a half quicker than the big box pet store down the street from me.  The owner is really nice.  She always remembers my dog and me whenever I call for an appointment.  She's also been very accommodating on the days that I've called to see if she could squeeze him in at last minute.  The only real negatives are that Hair of the Dog is not open on Sundays or Mondays.  But it's a small business and people are definitely entitled to a day or two off each week.  There also have been a few times where I've gotten home and noticed that my dog's ear or tail fur were left ridiculously long (hard to tell in the shop when he's running and jumping all over the place, but I'll consider that my bad for not being observant enough when I picked him up.  Hair of the dog is a wonderful place to take your dog to.  I highly recommend supporting this local small business.

Is this the best sushi I ever ate?  No.  Not even close. But is it a fun environment, with decent rolls, and cheap?  YES!  The sushi comes in small orders starting at around $1.50 and moving up to about $4 or $5.  There's nothing special about the rolls at sushi station, but the price is a lot cheaper than grocery store sushi, and the quality is much better.  The tuna and avocado roll, the salmon and avocado roll, and spicy crunchy salmon roll were all good.  A total of 8 orders for two people came to a little more than $17.  Good deal.  Just a note for some people; Look at the menu.  Every special roll, most appetizers, and most salads have shell fish in it.  It's mostly prepped and can't be changed.  If you have a food allergy, or other dietary restriction, this may not be your sushi place.

A restaurant with a massive identity crisis. Nimbus has no idea if it wants to be a micro brew or just a casual restaurant in a fairly high class shopping center.  The space is too big and very under utilized.  It doesn't feel like a microbrewery.  Nearly every trace of the old tenant (Taberna) remains.  There's just a new coat of paint on the wall, some oddly placed monkey posters and statues, and several undersized flat screen tv monitors spaced too far apart.   There isn't much of bar scene, so I don't why I would come here to watch a game.  While I'm on the decor, I also need to ask what's up with the wine cooler in the dining room?  I must have spent half my meal steering in its direction wondering why it was there.  They could have put another booth is that corner, doesn't that make more sense?  The patio is big and looked like a nice place to enjoy a meal or drink on a cool night.  However, it's in the front of the restaurant and you have to walk through it to get to the hostess stand.  It actually felt a little awkward trying to find my way in and out of Nimbus.  The food isn't bad, but it's also not very memorable.  I had the monkey melt.  A pretty standard patty melt on marbled rye with grilled onions and american cheese.  Nothing I would ever dream about ordering again.  What I would dream about eating again is the sweet fries I ordered on the side.  Those may have been the best sweet potato fries I've ever had, but an awesome side dish is not going to bring me back to a restaurant.  My fianc√© had the chicken pesto sandwich.  It was the definition of lackluster.  Not bland, just not very tasty.  It was also very soggy thanks to a lack of toasting the ciabatta roll it is served on.  The service was also not bad, but not great.  Another feature of Nimbus's identity crisis is the way the servers are dressed.  They're nearly unidentifiable.  They were wearing ASU or UofA t-shirts and jeans or shorts.  I don't have a problem with this (especially at an establishment that may be trying to sell itself as a sports bar), but until our waiter came to our table to ask for our drink order, we would have had no idea he was an employee.  Perhaps he should have worn an apron or a name-tag or something.  He also went pretty long stretches without checking up on us considering the restaurant was fairly empty.  So what is good?  The beer.  It's fairly good.  I've had some of Nimbus's brews that other bars and restaurants in Arizona.  If you're a pseudo-beer snob, and enjoy supporting local breweries (even if they're from out of Tucson) I recommend giving them a try.  Another big plus; Nimbus is on local dines (https://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) with a $25 for $12.50 gift  certificate which is applicable toward alcohol!

Mellow is the wrong word to describe the vibe at this pizza joint.  WIth a name like Mellow Mushroom, I was expecting to walk into a hippie dive.  The kind of place where everything looks like it's from out of the seventies and dedicated to the herbal drugs that users inhale.  Instead, Mellow Mushroom has a hipster bar ambiance.  Instruments and other musical items decorate the walls giving it a modern jazz bar feel (only with flat screens playing sports hanging across the bar).   With an overabundance of pizza places in any town in the US, Mellow Mushroom stands out by specializing in uniqueness.  Their specialty pizzas all sound odd but tasty.  The beer menu is huge and the 45 on tape are dedicated to micro and specialty brews.  If you want your traditional domestics, bottle or can is all your going to get.  My fianc√© and I split a caesar salad and a Thai Dye.  The caesar salad was prepared perfectly.  The dressing was mixed in well and not overly creamy.  The croutons were awesome.  They were made in the restaurant, not from out of a box.  Why don't more places do that?  The pizza was great.  The quality from the dough to the cheese to the topics was excellent and fresh.  The sweet curry sauce on pizza actually worked a lot better than I expected.  The service was also excellent.  Our server was really cool about explaining the drink and food menus.  He also pointed out a few things about the layout of the restaurant.  There also was another waitress who stopped by every now and then asking if we needed anything.  The teamwork was noted an appreciated.  Nice to to hear someone say "let me find your server."   My only complaints are that we were originally seated under a vent, and it was freezing.  They had no trouble moving us, but wow, they may want to save a few bucks on their energy bill and turn down the a/c.  The prices are also a little higher than I wound want to pay for a pizza.  But they do make up for the price with quality.  Mellow Mushroom is definitely worth it if your looking for a change from pace from you're regular pizza place.

With the exception of very friendly employees, Cafe Zupas fails in pretty much every category I can think of.  It's the cheap Paradise Bakery.  If you've read any of my Paradise Bakery reviews, you'd know that's not a compliment by any means.  Whomever dreamed up the concept of this quick service restaurant really didn't think things through.  The counter is a complete cluster.  There are monitors with videos playing that blocks the menu board.  So if you don't know what you want, you need to grab a paper menu.  Pretty awkward for a first timer.  Standing in a big group of people steering at menus also was an unexpected and uncomfortable experience.   I then ordered my sandwich and a salad at the left end of the counter, navigated my way around the people waiting for soups, past the dessert counter (desserts actually looked awesome, so I'd bet they were not made on sight), then to the registers.  Retold the order I just made but was still waiting on to the cashier.  Then I had a brief wait for my food at the register.  I usually am not a big fan of the take a number system.  But that would be very helpful at this place.  Also, some sort of a ticket to hand the cashier or a register at the same place you order would be nice as well.  The food wasn't very good.  The summer chicken salad was short on toppings.  Plenty of lettuce, a decent amount of fruit, but only a few pieces of chicken. The french bread from any nearby supermarket would have been tastier than what they offered on the side.  The chicken pesto panini wasn't very flavorful or filling.  While the entrees are cheap, you're going to have to shell out for the sides if you want a complete meal.  There are so many fast food options in the district of Desert Ridge Marketplace.  I suggest skipping Cafe Zupa.  The short walk to Paradise Bakery is worth it if you want a quick sandwich or salad.  (Did I really just say that?)

Without a doubt, Herbert Budwig is the reason that we are living in our house.  He's a true professional and dedicated realtor.  His entire team are some of hardest working people I have ever met.  We knew we wanted to live in the Desert Ridge area.  With the housing market turning around, there's a lot of competition to find a good home at good price, and this part of the valley is even more competitive than most.  After many failed bids, most realtors probably would have encouraged us to start looking elsewhere, but not Herbert.  He literally found us a house by reaching out to as many people as he could.  He then guided us through a very complicated short sale process with constant updates.  Herbert also attended our closing, and still checks in from time-to-time to see how everything is going.  He always wants feed back on the people he recommends you use.  Even after the closing, he's been great about returning phone calls and emails about little questions we have.  We have no intentions of selling this house, or buying a new one, in the near future.  But if that changes, we'll definitely be contacting the Budwig Team again.

You really don't know what good olive oil is until you've truly tasted good olive oil.  Oils & Olives sells straight from Queen Creek Olive Mill, giving customers the flavorful experience.  It's just like visiting QCOM sans the hour drive and a few other things.    All the oil and vinegar flavors and all the tapenades are available.  You can sample all of them here as well.  There's also plenty of locally made beauty products and wines.  The only thing Oils & Olives is missing is the tour and the food.  I can live with that.

I didn't know that this restaurant existed until I saw a $30 for $15 gift certificate on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485), and I'm sure glad I gave it a try.  I would have never thought that one of the better mexican spots in the valley would be this far north?  No wait and live music at 7:00 on a Friday night also made for an enjoyable night.  The restaurant itself doesn't scream mexican in anyway.  There is a stage and couches to the right of the bar.  The band that was playing on this particular night played a modern jazz style of music, giving Hacienda's more of an upscale lounge ambiance.  We were seated immediately, and chips and salsa were placed on the table in seconds.  Already a good start!  I ordered Irene's Anaheim Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas.  Very good.  The plate is covered in a mushroom sauce that a lot of people may like better than I did.  I personally would have preferred a traditional red or green enchilada sauce, but I'll give Hacienda's credit for doing something unique.  My wife had the chicken fajitas.  Who doesn't love good fajitas?  Not only was this a good meal, but it could easily feed at least two.  If you order it, you're going to need to take it home, maybe with an extra tortilla or two.  We were seated by the kitchen and watched countless fried ice creams being brought to the tables.  Wow, did they look good.  Somehow, we decided to skip out on desert, but we certainly will have to give it a try next time.

This quick-service sandwich chain is a welcome new addition to the valley.  If you're looking for a comparison to somewhere more established; think Paradise Bakery, but take away the coffee and baked goods and replace it with a much bigger meal selection, and lower prices.  Like most Paradise locations, McAlister's has its customers order at the register, gives a number, and brings the food to them.  I had the New Yorker (corned beef, pastrami, swiss and spicy mustard on rye) with a side of potato salad.  Very good.  Not close to anything you'd find in a New York deli, but on par with anything I'd expect from a sandwich shop.  The potato salad was pretty good as well.  My fianc√© went with the choose two (half orders of two menu items) with a grilled chicken sandwich (comes with lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard on a croissant) and a baked potato.  Both were delicious.  We both also had the tea (the sweet tea appears to be something McAlister's is known for).  Not being a big sweet tea fan, I asked for half unsweetened.  This worked out well for me.  If you're a sweet tea fan, you'll probably love the real thing.  McAlister's staff is very welcoming and friendly.  Maybe a little too friendly.  The soda and tea fountains are behind the counter, but they have no problem refilling your drink for you.  In fact, a worker will pass your table and ask if you want a refill.  Several times.  It almost felt like they were looking for something to do.   But it's nice and unexpected service, so I will not complain.  The one thing I will complain about is the menu board.  It either needs be moved up or reprinted much bigger.  The meals are listed in white font against a black background.  While the names are easy to read, the descriptions are small and are tough on the eyes.  I'm 32, my fianc√© is 27, and we both had to look at a takeout menu instead of steer at the board.  I can't even imagine what this would be like for older people.  It felt like McAlister's was reminding me it's time for my annual visit with my optometrist.

Downtown Phoenix bar.  Old Town Scottsdale prices.  I guess that's Gypsy Bar's way of making up for not charging a cover but still validating parking.  It's half dance club, half arcade.  There are hot girls dancing on little stages and people randomly drawing artwork, but somehow this place has no personality.  If you're looking for a spot with a nightclub feel that's in the middle of a part of town that has a weak nightlife, you'll probably have a better time than I did.

A fantastic sub from a chain sandwich shop?  It does exist!  I'll happily let Potbelly fill stomach with its tasty food anytime.  I went with "a wreck" which appears to be Potbelly's signature sandwich.  Salami, roast beef, turkey, ham and swiss; how can you go wrong?  The multi-grain bread is fantastic, and I piled on most of the fixings which made made for a perfect lunch.  Make sure to have the hot peppers, they really add to the flavor.  The regular is fairly small, but only $5.  I recommend going with a big size, or maybe having a cup of soup or chips or something as a side.  Potbelly delivers a meal head and shoulders above its peers.  Easy online ordering from its website will allow you to skip what certainly must be a crowded cityscape lunch line.  Ditch the nearby Jimmy John's and Subway and give the new place in town a try.

Yogurt+ is a C- if you're grading on a generous curve.  It's just another mediocre self-serve frozen yogurt spot.  As if there aren't enough of those around the valley.  Unlike the Mojo in nearby CityNorth there's a decent variety of flavors to choose from.  Unfortunately, few of the six flavors my fianc√© and I tried had a decent taste.  Something just wasn't right with most of them.  A few (Chocolate Coco Cake, Cinnamon Roll, and Cappuccino) even made me gag when they touched my tongue.  Pistachio was the only one that I enjoyed, but not enough to recommend that anyone go out and even sample it.  When it comes to toppings, there's plenty of candy and some fresh fruit, but a severe lacking of quality nuts.  I'm also not a fan of there only being one large bowl size.  I hate how these charge-you-by-the-ounce places try to fool customers into putting more in their bowls than they may actually want.  The space is big and clean.  It looks exactly like a Yogurtology which was originally going to move into the spot.  I don't know what happened with that, but someone appears to have swooped in with this less than stellar self-serve yogurt shop instead.  It's a shame.  Desert Ridge really could use a decent desert place.  Unless they tweak their flavors, it's too bad Yogurt+ isn't it.

I don't know who Danielle B (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=t-CTq6dtLW_bePYX3DNjwg) is, or what her affiliation to Yogurt+ happens to be.  I can only assume she has some sort of a relationship to the business, because two days after I posted my original review of Yogurt+ she sent me this message:   "Do you have a life?  Are you serious that you spend time writing crappy reviews about great places because you CARE.  What BS! Why don't you let people decide for themselves.  And let me tell you about quality NUTS, you clearly don't know what quality NUTS are because its evident you don't even have NUTS.  Take some testosterone. I can't believe you really spend this much time of your life trying to destroy people who are hard working and making something of themselves."   I wrote a respectful message in return asking Danielle B about her passion for Yogurt+, and if we could have a discussion about Yelping and why I disliked the place so much.  More than 24 hours later, she has not yet replied.  So in addition to being sold overpriced artificial tasting yogurt, I have been personally attacked for expressing my opinion on a business.  The one thing I had no complaints about with Yogurt+ was the customer service.  But it appears this business may not have that concept down either.  And if Danielle B doesn't have a direct connection to Yogurt+, then she has chosen an unfortunate way to represent the business as its unofficial ambassador.  I never in my original review told people not to go to Yogurt+.  I simply expressed by personal opinion about what I thought about an institution that took my money in return for a product that I feel is not worth purchasing.  But if this is the way Yogurt+ or its fans take criticism, then it shouldn't be in a business that deals with the general public.

A good, but rather expensive, spot to eat at the airport.  Being fans of the Scottsdale restaurant and by convenience of being just feet away from our gate, my wife and I decided to grab a bite at Cowboy Ciao before boarding an overnight redeye from Phoenix to London.   I love the quesadilla del dia (of the day) concept.  Sure, it's probably the expiring stuff that they need to get rid of, but when folded into a tortilla with melted cheese, who knows any better.  I'm shocked mexican restaurants don't use this idea.  We also had a west coast wrap which was quite tasty.  The chips served with the sandwich were great.  Just a word of warning, Cowboy Ciao is pricey.  With tip and just water to drink, those two orders came to about $29, and they were probably the two cheapest items on the menu.  It's good food, especially for airport dining, but it will cost you.

Like many other misplaced Chicagoland natives who somehow settled in the valley, the little things are what I miss the most.  One of those little things are the amazing hot dog and italian beef restaurants all over the city and its sprawling suburbs.  Portillo's not only was one of my favorite of those places, but it was the one that my brother and I would ride our bikes over to so we could get a cheap and delicious lunch before hitting up a movie on a random summer afternoon.  With that kind of nostalgic expectations, Portillo's in Scottsdale had a lot to live up to, and guess what?  They hit the mark with a perfect bullseye.  A jumbo hot dog with everything on it (like a good Chicago place even an Arizona Portillo's knows that means no ketchup unless specifically requested), fries, and a piece of chocolate cake!  The 10 year old me, who ate this meal more times than I can even try to remember, couldn't have been any happier.  The dog is pretty much what I remember loving as a kid.  The bun was a lot soggier than it should be, which resulted in the very fresh condiments falling out, but I can forgive that.  The fries were the perfectly crispy "crinkly" fries that the best places always served.  The cake was perfectly moist and scrumptious with the very sweet [and unnecessarily too much] frosting that I couldn't get enough of as a child.  My fianc√© had the italian beef.  Awesome.  Make sure to order it dipped.  Messy but flavorful.  She also ordered cheese fries (they just give you a container of some cheese sauce that I couldn't stop dipping my fries into).  By the way; the food is cheap!  All that and two soft drinks was only a little more than $20.00.  The line out the door was expected, and even a little daunting, at 6:30 on the Friday night following the grand opening.  The good news; It moved fast.  We got our food and found a table in a little over a half hour.  If that can be done in the first week, then the pace will certainly speed up when the excitement starts to ware down.  If you're not already a Portillo's fan, you may want to wait a few weeks for the hype to die down before you give the place a try.  It's not like there was a shortage of Chicago hot dog and italian beef places around the valley.  But Portillo's is certainly a top notch addition.

Newer, bigger, modern and just slightly up the road location. Same wonderful food. Matt's Big Breakfast may have lost it's dive-status, but it's still a great place to eat.  The menu, like the restaurant, remains simple and small. But all the offerings are delicious and plentiful. I decided just to go with the griddlecakes. I was left happily stuffed for hours.  Even with a few more tables than at the old location, I'm willing to bet that there's still a big line on weekends, but at 7:30am on a Tuesday, the restaurant was practically empty. If you're around downtown Phoenix during the early morning hours, why not stop in a Matt's Big Breakfast?

The location of this Krispy Kreme is great in theory.  Located on Bell Road, just feet from State Route 51, the store's sign is clearly visible from the highway.  I drive past it everyday and thought it had opened weeks before it actually did just because how much the sign sticks out.  So when I was hungry the other morning and craving something sweet, and just about to pass that sign, I decided why not indulge in a doughnut.  So here's why this location is only good in theory;  Being so close to the highway entrance/exit, it's quite a challenge to get in and out of the plaza during the morning rush hour.  Bell road is packed.  You're going to have to wait quite a while to make that left turn on 36th street.  Then when you're trying to get out, you better either want to go south on the 51, or keep driving east on Bell road, because it's going to be a very tight squeeze if you want to get into the lanes heading to the 51 north, and turning left on Bell is going to be nearly impossible.  During my wait for an opening in traffic, I kept asking myself if this was worth it for a doughnut?  My answer is a resounding no.   Having not had a Krispy Kreme doughnut in years, I didn't realize how expensive they are.  99 cents for a plain glazed doughnut?  $1.10 for one of the variety doughnuts?  Unless you get a glazed made hot on site there's nothing special about them.  There's also plenty of non-chain shops that have a much better product for cheaper.  I decided to try a chocolate iced creme-filled and one of the specialty doughnuts, the oreo cake.  The chocolate iced creme-filled is okay (this was one of my favorites when Krispy Kreme was at the peak of its popularity), but I could get the same doughnut at any supermarket for 50 cents cheaper.  The oreo was awful.  It's just a regular chocolate doughnut with crushed oreos on top and a dollop of cookie and creme filling in the hole.  It should work, but for some reason, it just doesn't.  To make a long story short, neither was worth the calories or the price, and both made me wonder what was up with the Krispy Kreme Kraze in 90's.  Remember the lines at the drive through for the original location at Arizona Mills?  Remember when the donuts were sold in supermarkets and gas stations all over the valley?  But mostly, I remember when I didn't care after they all disappeared overnight.

It's about time Chipotle had a location on this side of the 101.  I'm so glad I no longer have drive to down to Paradise Valley mall when I am craving a burrito.  There's not much to say that couldn't be said about any Chipotle.  Unless you've never had the best quick service burrito on the planet, the food and restaurant is everything that you expect.  Prices are a little high, but so are the portion sizes and quality.  The space is pretty big, but I can image it being slammed during lunch.  I'm sure I will be picking up many orders from here for a long time to come.

I've eaten at this Chipotle way more times than I would like to admit in the short time that it has been open.  It's the perfect quick and affordable meal before hitting up a game or event at the Arena.  The quality of the food and the service is as good as any Chipotle.  I'm really impressed with the facelift they have given to the space.  The old attendant, Moe's, had a very similar concept to Chipotle.  Chipotle could have been lazy and just slapped a new coat of paint on the walls, instead they redesigned the layout, and created the much more modern and inviting look that their restaurants are known for.

If there ever was a place that delivered on its concept, it has to be Funky Food Shack.  It's certainly funky, it certainly has food, and it's certainly a shack.  Funky Food Shack would also be the perfect example of an alternative restaurant.  It's loaded with rundown mismatched old furniture, in a rundown converted old house, in a very rundown part of town  But in the end, what Funky Food Shack has going for itself, is a pretty good menu.  I'm a sucker for a good sandwich.  I'm an even bigger sucker for a good sandwich that you can't get anywhere else.  Funky Food Shack's menu is sandwiches, hotdogs, and salads with silly names and a style all to their own.  I had the Kung Fu Tuna.  Tuna mixed with peppers and jalape√±o with a sarachi mayo.  Sarachi and tuna salad is such a logical combination (it works perfect with sushi) that I cannot believe that I've never heard of anyone else doing this.  The sandwich is just $7 and comes with a "side salad" that's big enough to feed two.   And guess what make a good deal even better?  A $20 for $10 gift certificate from local dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  The only thing I don't dig about Funky Food Shack is the location.  It's a bad location.  And I mean bad as in it is a pretty bad part of town.  The parking lot is around the back, which you have to drive through an alley to get to, and I wouldn't feel comfortable walking through it, or leaving my car parked there, in the dark.  But during the day, when this place most likely attracts a pretty big lunch crowd from the nearby State Capitol and downtown business, I wouldn't be very worried.

I'm glad I gave Bootleggers another try.  It looks like this restaurant has made it past its learning curve and finally figured things out.  The service has greatly improved and the menu has been properly chiseled down. Also, the popularity of trying the new place has worn off, so Bootleggers isn't even close to being as packed as it was nearly a year ago.  The smaller menu may mean less choices, but it finally focuses on what Bootleggers appears to be all about. The smoked meats. The meats all come with a tortilla or bun, coleslaw, and a side. With a price ranging between $16 and $32, you still get plenty of food for a good price. Besides, it's not like any of the smaller cheaper items that disappeared in the last year are sorely missed. If I hadn't looked at my previous review, I'd never have even remembered what I had.  And don't forget to get a Local Dine (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) before heading to Bootleggers. The website has a $50 for $25 gift certificate for Bootleggers. Unlike most web deals, it covers alcohol. So enjoy a moonshine flight while you're at it.

In an age when frozen yogurt is all the rage, it takes guts to open up a shop that serves full-fat treats, especially when it's still not actually ice cream.  Frozen custard really isn't something many of us are used to.  I have childhood memories of enjoying a cup of custard when making stops in random midwest towns, but I would lying if I said I actually remembered what exactly it tastes like after nearly a quarter century.  But when a frozen custard shop opens just a little more than a mile from my front door, there's no way I'm not going to give it a try.  So my thoughts on custard.  Delicious.  I had a good old swirl of chocolate and vanilla.  The chocolate is not as flavorful as ice-cream, but it is pretty good.  The vanilla tastes just like cold and creamier version of anything you'd find stuffed into a pastry.  The texture of custard is a lot heavy and harder than soft serve ice cream.  There's also gelati.  These are more like italian ices, only in ice cream flavor.  I didn't have this, so I can't really describe it.  Heard good things about the sweedish fish flavor, but they didn't have it on my visit.

I should have had the pancakes.  Don't get me wrong.  The omelet I had wasn't bad.  I'm giving the place four stars after all.  The eggs and ingredients tasted fresh.  However; even for three eggs, it was pretty dense and for $9 I think access to more than three fillings (including cheese) without extra charges wouldn't be asking too much.   It did come with hash browns and toast, so that certainly does help justify the price being a dollar or two more than I would like to pay for breakfast.  The orange juice is awesome.  It tasted like the oranges were squeezed to order.  The employees are awesome.  I was alone just trying to get a quality bite to eat while my car was being worked on down the street.  I sat at the bar and the server was quick and efficient handling all the people sitting around.  He also offered everyone at least a water "to-go" as they paid their checks (anyone who had tea or coffee was offered that in a take out cup).  Snooze is bigger, cleaner, and more modern looking than most of the breakfast spots you're probably used to hitting up.  It's certainly worth at least a try.  But next time, I think I'm going to try the pancakes.  Or maybe the french toast.

I didn't notice too many "tart" flavors and the topping offerings are actually kind of small compared to other frozen yogurt shops.  But having said that, Tart & Toppings is a pretty solid little self serve fro-yo place.  There's not much of a variety of flavors available.  I think there are just three or four machines and I haven't noticed much of a rotation in my handful of visits.  Each flavor that I have tried has been pretty good.  The pistachio is incredible.  The toppings are just okay.  Pretty standard.  Despite that lack of variety, I've still been more than satisfied with the cups of yogurt that I have purchased at Tart & Toppings vs most other frozen yogurt places in this area.  The place is clean and doesn't have ice cream or cleaner smell.  The oversized table games are pretty fun.  You can sit down and play checkers or tic-tac-toe.  A great way to be entertained while you enjoy your treat!

The last time I went though $30 that fast I was sitting at a Black Jack table in Las Vegas, split a pair of aces against a dealer's five, and still managed to lose the hand.  The website showed that the waiting time for an emissions test at this location at 1pm on a Tuesday would be four minutes.  I honestly don't think it that long.  I pulled up to the gate, pressed the button for a ticket, and drove straight into the garage.  The guy stuck some sort of an outlet under the dash of my car, looked at the gas tank, charged me $27.75, gave me a certificate stating that my car passed, and sent me on my way.  The second they give you that certificate you can go to servicearizona.com and finish your license plate renewal.  While I think it's ludicrous that a five year old car needs an emissions check (which is not what this review is about), at least it was as painless of a process as possible.

While I was excited to see anything move into one of the nearly half-dozen vacant restaurant spaces in Desert Ridge, McFadden's is just another typical chain sports bar that this part of town isn't really clamoring for.  Desert Ridge Marketplace already has a good (but overpriced) sports bar, and a mediocre locally owned sports bar, so I am left wondering who felt it was a good idea to add a third.  On a friday night around 8:30 we were seated immediately.  Too bad it took quite a while for a server to stop by our table.  It wasn't very busy, but somehow four or five waitresses passed by us during a nearly 10 minute period.  It could have been more, or even less;  All of them looked like they may have been cloned from the same cute brunette [that's not a complaint].  One finally decided it would be a good idea to serve us.  To her credit, she was really nice and attentive once she took our order.  My wife and I split a goat cheese and grilled chicken flat bread.  A pretty well designed flat bread with arugula and mushrooms.  Pretty good, but nothing great.  $12 seemed slightly (but not egregiously) overpriced.  We also tried a belfast burger.  Covered in sauteed mushrooms and onions, with havarti cheese, it's a good burger.  We ordered it medium, and it definitely came out more on the rare side.  Served with pretty good fries, $12 was a good price point for this.  The beer selection is also pretty good.  McFadden's definitely screams bar more than restaurant.  The tables are all left bare.  No napkins, silverware, or even salt, pepper, or condiments are left on any of the tables.  It seems like it would make for a decent happy hour spot, but there's nothing advertising drink specials or happy hours or anything else that would convince me to come back to this bar over the countless others in the area if I was just looking for a quick place to meet up with a few friends for a drink.  It may have been a little too loud, but I did enjoy the music selection.  The tunes were all from the 80's and early 90's.  Stuff I happened to grow up listening to.  To make a long story short;  McFadden's isn't bad.  It just doesn't offer anything that says come here instead of anywhere else.

While I would still call McFadden's mediocre at best, you can now at least save some money with a Local Dine gift certificate (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485). $30 for $15. It helps make McFadden's a better option.

Garbanzo offers up a fresh and healthier option in the Desert Ridge food court.  While it's prices aren't expensive,  I honestly would rather pay a couple dollars more and head across the street to Pita Jungle for some much better mediterranean food.  But if you're already in the district, want to avoid a wait, and/or don't feel like driving around, then Garbanzo is a more than suitable alternative.  Also; All of the employees were very friendly.  Every worker who was there on Saturday were just teenagers, but it really felt like they were going out of their way to make sure customers understood the concept of this new restaurant and had a good experience.  Ordering an entree is similar to Chipotle.  Pick your protein as chicken or steak.  Or go vegetarian with mushroom or falafel.  Choose between a pita, wrap, or plate.  Pick from an assortment of mediterranean condiments.  The food is good.  I went with a chicken pita.  I guess I'm traditional like that.  The pita is more dense than I would prefer, but I guess that keeps it from falling apart.  My wife had the chicken kabob.  It comes with hummus, rice, and a vegetable salad (pretty much just chopped up fresh cumbers and tomatoes) and a pita.  The chicken kabob itself was good.  It was cooked to order which was a pleasant surprise, but a little odd that we had to wait and extra 5 minutes for one of the meals.  But they did cooke the chicken and peppers perfectly. The plate is big, but it's filled mostly with the hummus and rice.  The hummus is okay,  not terribly flavorful, tastes a lot like a supermarket brand.  The rice and veggies were good.  The pita is the same that's used for the entrees.  Since it's so dense it doesn't work well as something to dip into the hummus.  I would say that Garbanzo is a solid 3.5 stars.  I'm rounding up to four since it's probably the healthiest option for fast food in Desert Ridge and the employees are so friendly.  I recommend at least giving it a try if you happen to be at the mall.

Quality food at reasonable prices with a pleasurable indoor and outdoor dining area makes Modern Grove a wonderful neighborhood spot.  If you ever lived in a New York/Chicago city neighborhood, Modern Grove is a lot like the little place around the corner that your family would walk to, buy a meal, and maybe a snack or drink for later.  For lunch, the restaurant acts as a semi-service cafeteria-like restaurant.  Order your food at the counter, get a number, and somebody will bring it to you.  There is also a market near the counter, where you can get a lot of bottles of wines, beers, and unique sodas.  There were two only two things about Modern Grove that really bugged me. 1.  The menu board at the counter is incomplete. If you look around the restaurant there are other sandwiches and foods you can order.  Being a first-timer, I completely missed it.  If anything on those boards were something that would have interested me more than the panini I ordered, I guess I would've been SOL. 2.  No one bussed our plates. I know Modern Grove isn't full service for lunch, but I didn't see any spot for us to get rid of our dirty plates.  We weren't in a rush to leave and they sat on our table the entire time.  Not one employee stopped by to ask if they could clear the table.

Yes, I am giving 5 stars to a coffee shop with a name and concept that sounds like a cheesy early '90s skinamax flick.  I could be embarrassed by how much I actually enjoyed Bikini Beans Espresso, but why should I be?  I didn't just like the place because I am a dirty nearly middle aged man.  I liked it because it excels at its concept and actually serves up a good cup of coffee as well.  I stopped by Bikini Beans for a few reasons:  1.  I wanted a caffeinated beverage.  Seriously; that's #1. 2.  It wasn't that far out of my way. 3.  But I probably would have gone out of my way because I wanted to be able to say that I bought a cup of coffee from a sex-presso shop at least once in my life.  We all need goals.  Hey.  I'm 34 years old, married, and have a baby on the way.  Getting served coffee by an attractive young girl who's wearing a minimal amount of clothing is probably about as adventurous as I am going to get for a very long time.  The three baristas who were working Thursday afternoon were all lovely in every way.  If the coffee isn't enough of a pick-me-up, than at least they are.  The well placed drive-thru window is big, clear, and low allowing me to be a not-so-subtle perv.  It more-or-less forced me to check the girls out while they brewed the coffee.  The girls were also very personable.  They engaged me in small talk the whole time I was waiting for that my drink.  They even seemed like they were genuinely interested in what I was saying.  Asking me to try my drink and getting my opinion of it before I drove off was also a nice flirtatious touch.  I guess you may be interested in what I thought about that drink.  I had a B Cup of Mocha Frappe.  Not only could I make a lot of dirty sounding similes about holding on to a creamy mocha b cup, but It was delicious.  At $4.25 for 16 ounces, the price is on par with any chain coffee shop.  There's just some barely PG-13 t-and-a going on at Bikini Beans.  Nothing offensive or sleazy.  Just some easy on the eye girls wearing tight and tiny 2-pieces instead of aprons and polo shirts.  If you're near downtown Phoenix and in need of some coffee you may as well live a little and give this shop a try.  Bikini Beans is pretty much the same as Starbucks but a heck of a lot more fun.

Five Guys prices for fast-food that's just above McDonald's quality. I have only eaten at a Carl's Jr. a handful of times in my life and it's probably been about a decade since I last gave this franchise a try. I don't recall thinking it was anything special then, and my opinion probably isn't going to change anytime soon.   Carl's Junior serves a pretty big "$6 burger" on a brioche bun. The bun is phenomenal. The burger that's between the slices is mediocre. Splurging on the combo gets customers a bigger drink and more fries than any one human being should ever try to consume. I recommend saving at least a buck and half and skipping the fries, the burgers are big enough to satisfy your appetite.  Being attached to the US Airways center gives this location a little bit of a unique feeling. It's a convenient lunch or dinner spot for downtown workers (and the handful of downtown residents). It's also an option as a place to get a bite that's going to be a bit cheaper than whatever you would order at an event inside the arena.

10:30am on a Sunday last month and this place was a mess in every way, shape, and form.  My wife had called the day before to custom order jelly munchkins. I was in the room so I know she spoke to someone and made the order. She was told that they would be ready after 10:00am. When I walked in at 10:30 and there was a bit of a line so I patiently waited. I finally get to the register and inform the cashier that I'm here to pick up an order under my wife's name. Slightly confused, she asks if it was for a dozen jelly donuts and something else. I tell her it was for four dozen jelly-filled munchkins. Even more confused, she informs me that this location doesn't make those. Instead of causing a commotion, I step aside pull out my phone, and call my wife. She double checks that she called this location. She did. After a few minutes of trying to play middle man between the cashiers (I think one was a manager or at least an assistant manager) and my wife, my wife hangs up and calls the shop. She talks to the manager, who agrees to bake the order, but I then have to wait another half hour or so for the baker to make them. I sit around for a half hour. No one has the courtesy of coming by and letting me know that the order was finally ready. I had to walk up to the register and see if it was ready. I pay (full price) and leave with no intention of ever setting foot in this place again.  So an hour of my morning wasted based on incompetence. Thanks Dunkin'. Also; During the hour I was there, other people complained about orders being wrong, the shop being out of several varieties of donuts, and I think a worker only cleaned up the dining room once.

Of all the self-serve yogurt shops in the valley, Razzleberriez may actually be the best one I've ever tried. I'm just as surprised as you are. Who'd have thought that the best would be in The Westgate Center? A place I would never dream of going unless I was heading to an event at Gila River Arena or University of Phoenix Stadium.  Not only is there a decent selection (6 machines with 12 flavors and 6 mixes), but all of the flavors I tried were solid and not soupy. None had that artificial yogurt taste that manages to ruin the enjoyment of having a sweet treat. The strawberry taste like strawberries! The snozzberries taste like snozzberries! The toppings are pretty standard for what I expect to see at a yogurt shop. Prices are also on par with any other place.  If you're looking for a quick snack before or after hitting up an event or movie at Westgate, Razzleberriez is a great place to try.

It's been quite a while since I've been pleasantly surprised by the simple quality of the food provided by such a random little restaurant. I have to admit my expectations were pretty low when I decided to give Fresh a try. I figured it would just be another spot that served "healthier" meals; meaning smaller portions at higher prices. Yes, the prices are a little high. But the payoff is a fantastic little panini or wrap, made with higher quality ingredients, that kept me satisfied for hours.  If you're looking for a bite to eat before an event at the stadium or arena, Fresh is a fantastic alternative in the vast array of traditional fast-food and full-service restaurants that make up Westgate.

The valley needs more restaurants like Kale & Clover. A place that serves higher quality food in fair portions at a decent price (at least for the food). Kale & Clover has a pleasant cafe-style setup. Order at the counter. Get a number. A runner brings your food. The dining room has a modern ambiance and there is also a nice patio.  My wife and I went splitzies on a Cheat Day Burger and a Turkey Panini. The burger is perfect. the quality of beef is incredible and it was cooked perfectly. The brioche bun adds a flavorful touch. The panini probably should have just been called a sandwich. The bread is toasted but not hot or pressed. Nitpick aside; it's a delicious sandwich. Although, it felt like the chef got a little skimpy with the avocado. We both had side salads. Nothing special. A nice mix of greens and tomato with a great dressing.  The burger was $12. The panini was $10. A $20 for $10 Local Dines gift certificate (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) cut that down nicely. We'll certainly be back sometime soon.

There are a million things that I can nitpick about Mountainside fitness that would make it sound like I hate this gym. It's only about six months old, and there is already a lot of room for improvement. But overall, it's a more than adequate place to workout.  Let's start with what I really don't like: Locker rooms: There's a two-door entry designed for privacy, but I nearly get whacked in the face every time I enter and leave. The showers are nice, but way too small even for me (If you are built like a linebacker, or morbidly obese, you may get stuck). Like the showers, the sinks and hand dryers are ascetically pleasing, but not very practical. The floor: There are a very limited amount of popular machines. There is an underused cross-fit area which I guess is a money makers when it comes to personal training and bootcamps, but it feels like this space should be used for an extra peck deck, leg press, and many of the other machines that this Mountain side could use a second or third of. There's also an inexplicable 1/3 basketball court. What's the point of a hoops room where there's barely enough space for a high school/college 3-point line? The place is also filled with your typical gym rats that I had hoped I had left behind when I left LA Fitness. I know they're everywhere, but one can dream. Driving in and out: This isn't exactly Mountainside's fault, but I really hate that there is only one small street that accesses the gym. It would be nice if the city would build a second that connects to Deer Valley Rd.  So here's what I like: The staff is very friendly. Free towel service is always a plus. With the exception of stray towels and empty water bottles that are left all over the place by some less than courteous members, the floor is kept very clean. The equipment is new and in good shape. All of the cardio machines have a TV attached with a full cable line-up and even a CC channel that lets parents keep an eye on their kids who they have dropped off in the M-kids.  Speaking of M-kids; It's what I love: The "daycare" and its staff are amazing. The area feels like its nearly as big as the gym floor and has something for kids of all ages. There's a workout room, a tunnel and slide room, small basketball court, TV room, video game area, a play area for older kids, and a play area for babies. I can't even describe the the exuberance my 11-month-old daughter displays when I open the door and drop her off. The staff also shows equal excitement to see her as well every time. My daughter has been there when it's empty and overwhelming crowded, but it never seems like they don't have their act together. She's always in a happy mood when I pick her up. M-kids is an additional $15 a month for up to two hours at a time or $3 an hour if you don't want to pay monthly. There are also plenty of camps, "lunch bunch," and dinner and a movie nights, where you can pay to have the staff watch your kids for a few hours and you can leave the gym. Worth every penny.
