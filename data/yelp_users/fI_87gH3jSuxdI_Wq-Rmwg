Just proving I'm not a foodie snob ;) well it's cheap, effective and comes with free packets of ketchup. Enjoy!

Great place! Great Food. People who always say they can't find good sushi downtown need to find this place! They will make things off menu if you are so inclined. Happy hour is great prices as well.

OK, full disclosure, this was my first "spin" class. I'm usually seen on a road bike, and in daylight.   The class amazing, the music perfect, attitude great and the work out..fantastic! I will be going back. It was a little difficult to get the 'moves' down that are particular to this studio, but I was told everyone goes through it.   Simply put, it was the most fun I've had doing a workout. =)  Good job!

Amazing amazing food. Ordered the veggie tacos, empanadas, nachos and pork tacos. All very very good. The patio is happy hour ALL the time. Great pre/post event eats!

As an city dweller, who has been going to Switch for over a year, I'm sorry to say, I'm NOT going back. Two back to back horrible customer service experiences do not make up for a great atmosphere or good food. Wait staff was rude and unfriendly, which doesn't make any sense for a downtown bar. Boo to that!

Wow. THEE worst service. While I was there the following happened; 1) the 'baristas' who felt incredibly entitled failed to say 'welcome' or 'thank you' to the 6 customers who they helped. Apparently one was too hungover she actually rested her head on the espresso machine while getting an order. 2) Three times customers bussed their own tables only to be turned away by said entitled 'coffee artists' who simple looked at the dishes, pointed the individuals AWAY from her and said, "over there is where that goes" YOU WORK THERE, (maybe it's a work study program and they don't get paid? Because they certainly didn't care. 3) two sad men were at the counter, CLEARLY it was their first time there, the 'supremely non-plussed coffee divas' chose to instead chat about everything other then the customers who only wanted to help keep these ladies employed. And finally 4) my dish was on my table for a little over 30 mins, for all I know, it's still there. There are better places who take an investment in regulars and newbies.

What a downtown coffee house should be; taking themselves a little too serious without attitude. The ambiance might be a little loud for some; when weather permits, great little patio area outside.   Have yet to be disappointed with the coffee/food. Go there a few times and you start feeling like you walked into your own kitchen. If you cook great pastries, and had several tables....and ran a coffee house in your kitchen. You get the idea.

Simply put amazing. Lunch is a great, they have a select lunch menu. Have yet to have a bad item. Pizza, which I think is hard to mess up, is amazing. I recommend the cheese/pesto for an appetizer, great great great!  They have a great Sunday Bloody Mary for $5. It's made with jalapeno infused vodka. Go easy on them =)

Great music , drinks and food. Even though I didn't see the show that night, the place screams, "why aren't there more places like this in downtown Phoenix!"   Best thing, it's less the two blocks off the Van Buren light rail stop!!  Will keep going!

Great pour over coffee. Great seeping tea (which I learned from this place.)  The limited pastries are all made fresh, which I suppose is better over lots of options with limited freshness.   This is a great place to meet people too, everyone is pretty friendly, the community tables fit the ambiance.   Vibe reviews are spot on, its' a little too hipster, I think who is ever behind the counter calls the music. (If you are NOT a fan of deeply serious indie, avoid the late afternoon shift =)

I've tried this place three times, living only 100 ft away, I WANT this to be a good coffee place. First visit, grounds all over my coffee. Second visit, warm cup of coffee, third visit, stale coffee. With all the competition, (Lux, Giant, Lola ect.) this place should be better. I will go out of my way to other places over Shine, which I think is sad, because they should be better.

Ok, you have heard me say this before and it bears repeating. ATTENTION: New restaurant owners; Customer service!! "Have you been here before?" "Let's make this visit the first of many!" Seriously, Soooo easy to generate more business. All right, I'm off that soapbox.   Food, AMAZING. Once we got our bartender off her cell phone, very good drinks. and tacos, we went with the pork and short ribs, some of the best tacos I've ever eaten. That is coming from an Arizona native...just great spices/taste.   Will make this part of my rotation of restaurants.

Two things,First  I will NEVER understand a restaurant when you tell them "it's my first time here" and it just flies by their head. Please, check back, "did you like the food?" "Come back." "Here is a sample of something you didn't try." Nada! Off my soapbox.  Ok, if your a Mexican food place the spicy thing on your menu should not be the potatoes. Food was very bland, mushy, and seemed to have been sitting there awhile. Comparisons to chipotle for ambiance are accurate.   I will go back in a few months to see if its gotten better, it's a great concept.   Side note: upon walking up, you are smacked in the face with the smell of fish. It's from a pond nearby, come mid summer it's going to STINK!

Service terrible. Sushi par at best. Better sushi places out there. My salmon sashimi had bones in it.

First timer there. Went for breakfast, it has much to be desired. House coffee had grounds in it, nothing very good in taste. Breakfast was over priced, two eggs two pieces of bacon and a small slice of bread, over $8. Granted it's downtown and it should cost that much. I wanted it too be better.   Side note; the morning our party went they were preparing chicken in wood burning stove, our entire group left smelling of a campfire. Some like it, some don't.
