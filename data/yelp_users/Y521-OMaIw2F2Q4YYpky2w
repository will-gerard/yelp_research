I will never return to this nail place!  I got a gel manicure and a pedicure last Friday. The gel manicure did not even last 2 days. The thumb nail on my right hand chipped. I went back in that Monday to have it repaired, they seemed very put out to have to fix the chip. I was seated about 5 mins later the nail tech looked at my thumb and the rest of my fingers noticed all the tips were not polished and that was likely causing the chip. The tech filed the thumb and then placed the black gel over the filed area. Then had me place my hand under the light. She was about to place the top coat when I pointed out that the nail was now uneven so she placed another coat of the black gel in the area. After the light cured that coat, the top coat was applied to that nail and the rest of my nails. I was sent on my way. That repair lasted one day. That same nail chipped the following day and the additional top coat started peeling 3 days later. It has now been a week since I had the gel manicure and they look terrible! I have no complaints about the pedicure it was satisfactory. When I spend $70 on a manicure and pedicure I expect it should last the 2-3 weeks it normally does, not days!

Dr Pogue is wonderful as is his staff! They don't only provided top of the line oral surgery, they also have an amazing aesthetic team. I recently had a wonderful dermoplan facial there. My face looked and felt amazing after. Love this office and the staff!

Great food. Wonderful and friendly staff. This hidden gem will be a frequented stop for me.   My boyfriend and I tired the jalape√±o  humus, it was cream and served with a warm pita. We also split the mixed plate  and the falafel.  The mixed plate included 3 kinds if meat, rice and grilled veggies. It was very savory. the falafel was delightful as well. Everything was do filling I couldn't eat desert so we got the baklava to go. The baklava was delicious! Big fan of this place!!!

I was underwhelmed by this dining experience! The evening started out on the patio which was well heated. The greeter sat us at stable for two next the door, which seemed perfectly lovely until servers began to utilize the door. It was constant slamming, as the door had no stopper. We asked if we could move as it felt like the glass window might shatter on us at any moment. They happily moved us in doors. You could still hear the constant slamming of the door but the possibility of shattered  glass was no longer a concern. We ordered the trio bruschetta to start. Although the presentation was lovely the dish lacked flavor. Then we had the kale and Roma salad which again was bland and had no flavor. Finally we ended the experience with a white pizza with sausage and mushroom, which sadly had very little flavor. Also the mushrooms appeared to be canned mushrooms and we're not fresh or high quality. The only saving grace of his experience was the wine. I would not recommend this establishment.

Loved the food, loved the patio. Service was a little in the relaxed side and the charger for extra chips and salsa which are the only reasons this place didn't get 5 stars. By the way if you want to try a healthy side get the market fresh veggies . Tonight was Brussel sprouts and they were amazing!!!

Unimpressed. Started with the guacamole, it was like eating a raw onion. The fajitas came out cold with no sizzle. The chicken enchilada were the only saving grace.

Wow what a gem this place is! Beautiful suit, fabulous prices, friendly staff.  If you're looking for a suit for spring or summer or anytime this is the place to go. I typically hate shopping for bathing suits but this is the best experience I've ever had.

Second time here was a cluster. The front staff was very unorganized and unprofessional. I was told our wait would be 15 minutes. They proceeded to seat people that arrived after we did. We waited 25 minutes I finally asked the hostess and I was told the owners Doctor got precedence over us. That is the last time I attempt to eat here.
