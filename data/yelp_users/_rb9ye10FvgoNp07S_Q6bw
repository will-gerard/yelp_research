Over-rated, over-priced and where's the filling. Tastes like flavor-less boxed-cake with sugary frosting. Can't believe the owner judges Cupcake Wars and doesn't change her recipe!  I want some filling in the middle with a ganache icing for that price! Lines out the door...I don't get it!

What a great place! I have an entire pantry shelf just for their oils and vinegars..love them! I can't remember the last time I bought a bottle of salad dressing! Once you taste their product you're hooked.  I just bought a bottle of blueberry vinegar...it's the best thing I ever tasted. The Dark Chocolate or Espresso vinegar on strawberries and raspberries is awesome! And White Truffle oil in  mashed potatoes is decadent.  I love Tess..she is the Julia Child of their products, Not only can you taste everything, but Tess has recipes she shares as you taste!   If you have a pantry filled with bottles of preservative-laden salad dressing, get rid of them and try Outrageous Olive Oils and Vinegars...delicious and well worth the price!

I love the Jo Paris Salon! The warm greeting when you walk in makes your tensions just melt away. Always friendly and ready to help.  And I love Jesse Fortin. He is truly a master at hair color. If you're a blonde, Jesse is your person. And you know how picky we blondes can be!  With just a glance, he is off to start mixing. And an hour later...your smile is as big as Paris! Beautiful!   Great place, Great people...the place to go!

I am not sure why other people gave this restaurant more that 2 stars. I had a terrible dinner.   The appetizer called a Charcuterie plate was dry, bland toast triangles, squares  of cheese like we used to have in high school, some dried cranberries and almonds.   Their Twisted Burger, which was supposed to be their specialities, had so much overly sweet onion jam, barely cooked bacon, unmelted cheese and tons of mayo that it was inedible.. The fries were cold. And the most surprising part was the wine pour, barely 3 oz. in a big wine glass. The owner was running the bar. and the waitress told us that's all  he allowed.  The wine was really good, and was from their own winery. You would think they would give at least a normal pour as bottles are available for purchase. Talk about poor marketing!  After commenting to the waitress, the second glass had a little more. I asked to taste a wine and was told the bottle wasn't open and i would have to order a glass. Wouldn't it have made more sense to open the bottle, as I may have purchased it or at least had 1-2 glasses. Poor marketing again.  This was the second time I tried this restaurant, knowing it was bad the first. But wanted to give them another chance as they were new the first time.  I would have thought they would cater more to their patrons, as this time of the year, most of us in AZ are residents and it could become one of our favorites.  I hate to see restaurants destroy themselves when a new chef and some better customer service, along with a customer-friendly owner could surely help.  * By the way, the food pictures below were not even on the menu.
