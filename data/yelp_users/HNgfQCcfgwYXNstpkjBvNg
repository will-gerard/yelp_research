Worst walmart ever! Go there late on the way home from work sometimes and now I never will again. It's filthy dirty and the service is horrible. They have pallets all over the place and you can't navigate the isles and the stockers don't help accommodate you they will watch you have to go out of your way to come around the other side to grab stuff. Most humans would say let me move this so you can get by or can I grab u something NOPE. Wait 45 minuets in a long line with one register open. Horrible never returning.

Horrible experience! Let me say we were here last week and it was much better but tonight was not good waited 40 min for an appetizer and 20 mints for drinks. The restaurant didn't appear to be that busy so I don't know what the problem was but I think I'm done with that place.

Worst Taco Bell ever always out of different soda every time I come. No sense of urgency it's suppose to be fast food but waited in a line for 15 min just to order. Cashier was so slow and so was all the people in back someone should light a fire in there butt for sure

I love Chick Fil A but my experience today was not good at all. The bathroom had no toilet paper so I let the employee know as she was going in and I was coming out. I came back 10 minuets later and still no toilet paper. The staff was super slow despite the fact they were really busy and only had 1 register open but all kinds of people walking around back there.  I saw a shift leader just stand there for 10 min waiting for his own food but offering no assurance to anyone else. No sense of urgency at all

This was the most awesome comic book store I've seen. They have some vintage toys and old collectible comic books. The stuff is so well laid out and easy to access and the managers are so friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this place

I posted the while menu and just so you know the pizzas are 12' unlike Jon B says it's not $15 for an 8' pizza. Best place for good food great service and to watch the cardinals play! side note yelp needs to stop taking all the good reviews down and leaving the negative this is a great place!!!
