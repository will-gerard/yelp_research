I love LGO! They have the BEST chocolate chip sea salt cookies that I have ever tried! I am also obsessed with their breakfast commuter, it is to die for! This place has such great food, which is why it is ALWAYS so busy, and that is the only complaint I could give this restaurant, but it really isn't their fault... just needs more seating so that it doesn't take forever to find a place to eat.

I have been going to d'lish for years now and I am obsessed with their breakfast BUZZ!!! It's delicious and so is their breakfast sandwich, the California club! The only thing that I don't like is how small the restaurant is and the lines for the drive threw are extremely long. But their food is delicious so it's worth the wait, and that is probably why the line is so long.

This is such a cute store! They have really unique and fashionable i teams for mainly children, but also some cool items for adults as well. If you are ever looking for a gift this is a great place to go. The owner is also very kind and helpful. I always stop by this boutique whenever I am in the old town area, because I know they are constantly getting new items.

horrible service, took a very long to get my nails done and after 3 days they already look horrible! spent $60 for a mani and pedi and could have done a better job myself for free.

I have an unlimited membership to this salon for only $89 dollars a month. I can use any bed, spray machine, or any other facilities they have everyday. Meaning I can go spray tanning every day if I wish, and usually a spray tan is around $20. I really take advantage of my membership. Not only is it a great value, but the store is extremely clean and the customer services is amazing, they aren't pushy into having you buy products if you don't wish to buy them like many of the other salons I have gone to, they basically won't let you leave until you buy a product.
