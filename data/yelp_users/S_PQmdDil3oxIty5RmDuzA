Went in to get some ramekins, while holding a toddler in my arms, possibly not the best scenario, but it had to be done. The staff quickly asked if I needed any assitance. They happily found the size and amount I needed. They even asked what I would be making with them, gave me tips and suggestions, etc. Overall wonderful experience. Next time I will bring a stroller to look at all the awesome gadgets.

Helpful staff. Love going and "picking their brains." Great prices and friendly service. I also enjoy the chickens running around.

I love Solo, have been coming here when the owner Chad, was the only employee. We would talk LOST theories and what not. Really chill place to grab amazing coffee. They have more baristas now, and I've had some of them not be consistent on the quality, but lately it seems that they have gotten it down.  The best part is that they sell Cortez coffee, which is fair-trade. Our favorite roast is the primo, which is the same roast they use for their espresso. It is fresh and delicious.  I definitely recommend coming here for coffee, as other reviewers have said, it's not the fastest place, so if you are in a hurry, you may have to come when you don't have to run out the door. But if you aren't in a rush, enjoy!

I've been here twice. The first time, my husband and I were using a restaurant.com gift so we splurged. Their spring rolls are awesome and fresh. The dishes were full of flavor and you could really taste the herbs which were great. We enjoyed the thai tea and desserts. It was a first for both of us to try the bean desserts, super yummy.  The second time I went with my friends. We had an order of spring rolls and soup. Two of us got pho and the other friend had the spicy noodle soup. When my friend ordered the house special pho, the male server said "that's that combo, you don't want that, this one is better for you." My friend asked what was the combo, and he didn't respond, just insisted she should change her order. Being confused she agreed with him. Regardless of the change, our food was delicious.  So why do I give it only 2 stars?  Their male server sucks. He never explains what he is doing, leaves you wondering what he went off to do when he leaves the table. The whole experience turns into a guessing game.  On the second visit with my friends, I had ordered two desserts, but had asked him to hold the order on one, until we were ready to leave, as I was going to take it to home, to my husband, as a treat. He brought both of them at the same time. Usually this isn't a huge deal, but it's a frozen drink, and when it melts, it loses it's taste and quality. I felt rushed to finish my drink and finish the outing with the girls, as I wanted to get the drink to my husband in decent condition.  Next, I tried to use the yelp check-in discount, showed it to him prior to ordering, he said, ok, but when it came to paying, he wouldn't give me the discount. He kept on asking me to show him the discount, so I showed him that I checked in, he grabbed my phone, pushed some buttons, couldn't figure it out and walked away. My friends and I were just looking at each other, wondering if he was going to get a manager to help, he came back a few minutes later and asked if I had figured it out. To which I responded, I thought that's what you were doing. I was so frustrated by this point that I said forget it, just give us our check please. He rolled his eyes and came back with the checks.  My husband and I had the similar unpleasant experience with him the first visit. The ladies that work there are really nice, and honestly, they were the only reason I came back with my friends. I figured the male server was having an off day. I'm not sure that they have other servers, I wish they did. This would be one of my favorite places to go if they had better service.  Pho Ao Sen, please, please, train your male server with some customer service.

My husband and I used our restaurant.com coupon at this place, we had 3 specialty rolls and a tempura cheesecake. All of the food was delicious. It also came out really quick, the sushi was fresh and beautifully plated.  The price is typical of other sushi restaurants, but here you are paying for the sushi, not the bar scene.  Give it a try, perfect place to go before a movie. Our favorite roll was the Arizona Roll.
