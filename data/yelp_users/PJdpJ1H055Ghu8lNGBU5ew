A friend surprised me with a trip here one day... I decided to try out their Silver Admission cuz they had a check-in offer. OMG so much fun!!  For less than half the price of going to a big 6 flags or something, you can get most of the same stuff here with rarely any lines. When I went in the evening, there were NO lines. Honestly, with the amount of time wasted at big parks in lines, you get SOOO much more here. Water rides, coasters, arcade, HUGE mini golf course (I only got half way...) and a zip line. I felt like I was a kid again.

I hate to give this place a 1 star, but I have to. Takeaway: NEVER BUY ON THE FIRST VISIT. Do your research, take the paper work home with you and read EVERYTHING.   There are some friendly, awesome people that work there and most of the management seems very professional. But they have certain shifty salesmen and management on their team lurking. This was my first time buying a new car, and I've definitely learned what NOT to do next time.   I went in to buy a used Kia Soul. I knew what I wanted, and have been popping in for a while to look at their used inventory. One time, a particularly aggressive Sales Manager (Chad, I believe) basically overtook the conversation I was having with a great salesman there, and pressured me into getting a brand new Kia. I was open to the idea but knew I couldn't afford it.   The way he got me into it was because I was focused on the monthly payment, and he got it down to a reasonable price. Or so I thought. I told him I wanted a base model with NOTHING extra. No extra coverage, bells and whistles, NOTHING. The sticker for the price had already been taken down from the window before I looked at the car. I relied on what he was telling me it was worth (20K). MISTAKE. I found the sticker stuffed into the glove box 2 months later, and it listed the value at around 17k. I confronted them on this, and I was told "they have a list of upgrades they put into the car to sell it", like tint, and whoever knows what else bc they didn't have a record of it. I am fine with that, but I had specifically mentioned I didn't want any extras at all.   I also found out that a $1,000 optional extended warranty was put into the paperwork too. Luckily, I found that and saw in the fine print that I have 60 days to cancel it... even thought when I came in to tell them I wanted to cancel it, the lady at the front desk told me I couldn't. I got it cancelled.   Also, for my trade-in, I told him I have a co-owner I would have to talk to before signing the car over and was very concerned about this before signing over my car. After much pressure, and since it was late at night and I was tired, I finally agreed to a great trade-in price he offered. He said I had 30 days to send the title in. I think this is super sketch and now that I look at it, a way to basically close a deal as soon as possible that could potentially screw me over if the co-owner decided they didn't want to sign the car over. Which is exactly what happened. My co-signer was pissed at me, so I went back the next day to see what my options were. The same manager told me, basically, I signed all the paperwork and my only option was to provide the title or pay the value out of pocket. AZ does NOT have a buyer's remorse law (where you have 3 days to return the product as a result of high-pressure sales) like they do in my home state Vermont. Thankfully, I got my co-signer to sign over the car. But this whole situation was completely in the interest of making a sale ASAP.  Overall, I had built trust with these guys over a few months and it bit me in the a** when it came down to the day I actually bought a car from them. Make sure to watch for extra things slipped into the paperwork and upgrades that aren't mentioned on the sticker price in the window. Where is your drive for a good reputation and retaining customers????

My favorite bar on Mill Ave... because it's friggen hot in Phoenix, and they have the best of 2 worlds mashed together... booze and slushies!!   I go for Happy Hour usually because it always seems to be Happy Hour there. Their food is really good too... I usually just get the Chicken Strips appetizer though. 191 Octane and Banana daiquiri mix with a dollar shot on the side, and maybe one or four of their alcohol-soaked cherries. I know what I want!

DUDE!! My favorite Thai restaurant to date!!!   My friends and I found this place on Yelp on our way back from hiking one day because I'm obsessed with Thai food and just wanted to find the closest one.   Don't judge it from the outside. First of all, it's called E-San Sab Sab Thai Cuisine now (formerly Pete's Thai Cuisine) which was a little confusing. Second, it's next to a smelly Auto Repair shop. But once you get inside.... fabulous decor, friendly staff, and delicious food. I saw they have a buffet certain hours, which I was a little sceptical... I've never been to a Thai buffet... So obviously we had to come back and check it out.   We've been 3 times since. Even though it's 30 minutes away, it's worth the drive. The buffet food is just as amazing as if they served it to you fresh out the kitchen!   5+++ stars.
