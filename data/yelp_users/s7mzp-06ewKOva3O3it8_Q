I have been coming here for over 10 years. I admit, it was better when Elle was here but I have always been treated well. They live my daughter, 11 and are super sweet even when she asked for weird things like skulls on her toenails. More than worth the 20$ I spend on a pedi.

I have been coming here for over 40 years. Today will be my last visit. The last two times we have gone the food has been sub par, plus they raised the prices. $4.25 for a bean burrito. Get real.   The tortilla now taste store bought, as do the beans. The cheese crisp was chewy and frankly missing the cheese. The only thing worth eating was the salsa.   Whoever is running the restaurant now has taken a city icon and destroyed or.

Homemade chips with feta and hot sauce with a margarita. Wonderful.

Worst experience I've had in a grocery store in a long time. The cashier was rude.  Threw my groceries down the belt. When I asked him to stop he started grumbling under his breath and started slamming them down instead. I will never come back to this Safeway again.

We stop by their booth at the Roadrunner Farmers Market every week. We started with just the lip balm because my daughter has very sensitive skin. At this point she is using the lip balm, lotion, soap and even the goats milk shampoo.  Her winter eczema has disappeared and we are amazed. I have rheumatoid arthritis in my thumbs and their pain lotion helps like nothing else I have used. We have even used their shampoo bar on the dogs which makes them smell super fantastic. As long as they continue to do business they have a lifelong customer.

I love QT. Best convenience store in the world, but these employees were so unfriendly. I would have given it 1 star for their behavior but the store was very clean. All four employees wore scowls on their face. And three of them were verbally unfriendly. You know how QT normally is, welcoming. This store is the opposite of that.

Adam is amazing and this salon does it all. From hair to massage, you will get fantastic service and results. The ambiance of the salon is amazing and they hit the nail on the head with the decor.

The wait staff is friendly and bends over backward to make sure you get what you need. They gave my husband a taste of a few beers so he could decide what he wanted. Food was yummy; specifically the truffle fries.

The night started out with a wonderful drink.  Then we got the food.  It was nothing short of just okay.  I ordered the cheese beer soup.  It was so thick I could've eaten it with a fork.  Not what i'm looking for in soup.  My daughter had a Caesar salad.  Again, just okay.  I will not go back.  The best part of the experience was the hostess.  She had on extremely high heeled shoes.  You could tell it was excruciating for her to walk.  She limped and cringed every step of the way to our table and back to the hostess stand.  When her shift was over, she stood next to the stand in her barefoot. Not cool in a restaurant. Who wears 4 inch heals to work when you're a hostess?
