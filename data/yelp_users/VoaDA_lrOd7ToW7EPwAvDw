Don't go in near closing time. Had to repeat my order twice to several people only to find that they missed pieces of it when I got home. Frustrated. All I really wanted was a salad and they couldn't give me my vinaigrette.

My review is specifically for the pharmacy and Theranos lab staff because that's my only experience at this Walgreens and thy are astounding. Quick and easy, with fast lab results and friendly personnel. Five stars from me.

We had terrible service and I'm sad that we went. It was a busy Saturday but even the few bartenders weren't friendly or helpful. Had to ask twice for drinks and everything else. I won't be going back by choice.

We tried Dubina for my husband's birthday celebration and it was perfect! It's a great local place that's hitting the ground running. It's not a fancy place with a glitzy menu, but the items we had were all well done (you won't go wrong with the local brat). They also had enough variety of beer on tap to please all kinds of beer drinkers. I really enjoyed the pumpkin ale, the gose, and the imperial IPA, however they all brought something different to the table. The atmosphere is also low key and the service is friendly. We will definitely be back and are happy to have this family run brewery in the west valley. Support your local brewery and check this place out!
