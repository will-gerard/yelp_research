Came here last month with my boyfriend for some sandwiches.  Such...a...disappointment.  As someone who frequents Mill Ave and all of its shops/restaurants/bars often, I often walk past In Season Deli and it's rarely even open.  I thought we had lucked out when we actually saw two people in there so we strolled in.  We asked for two turkey sandwiches with the works and he also asked for a side of pasta salad.  Now there was only one older woman making the sandwiches, but it literally took about 20 minutes to get our food.  There was literally a fly swirling around their display case of their pastas, puddings, etc.  The lights in the case were blinking the whole time, made it very unappealing.    Not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but they didn't even have any of their tables or chairs pulled out for customers, (maybe there weren't any yet that day?) so one of the employees pulled them all out for us and turned the misters on which was enjoyable.  The sandwiches were nothing special.  Something you would expect to see in a 2nd grader's brown bag lunch.  Regular wheat bread, oscar meyer brand turkey, one piece of lettuce, soggy tomato, mayo, and mustard.  His pasta salad had a film on it from being old, he didn't touch it.  Their sign actually fell off the wall as we tossed our food, it was priceless.  Really wouldn't be surprised if this place closes down.

Yes!  I love neighborhood bars!  A very "you're like family when you come here" kind of place.  I'm here at least once a week.  Between the cheap drinks, great food, christmas lights strung all around the whole outside patio area, the nice and extremely generous bartenders, the very friendly Casey Moore's cats who just walk around and people watch, or just the awesome memories I've had there...this place has all of the ingredients for a good time!

Essence, I adore you.  I would not expect you to look the way you do from looking at you on the outside.  But, on the inside?  Precious.  I had the Mediterranean Roasted Vegetable sandwich and it was amazing!  Fresh! SUPER filling, and very quick.   I will reunite with you again soon.  Promise!

This place is literally the only place my boyfriend and I order from for Chinese food.  We probably get delivery from Wongs once a week, and the delivery guy remembers us every time!  There was a weekend we didn't order because we were out of town.  The next weekend when we did order, the delivery guy said, "we didn't hear from you guys last weekend!"  Haha!  They're always really fast; 20 minutes from the time we call to the time they're at the door is average.  Always!  The food here is amazing.  I would figure that their prices should be way more considering the AMOUNT of food you get.  We always have leftovers (and everyone knows leftover chinese is even better the next day.)  I'm also a very picky eater and they've never given me grief when I've asked for substitutions, nor have they ever messed up an order.  Plus, they'll give you complimentary egg rolls!  As far as the restaurant itself goes?  It's ghetto looking on the outside!  Last time we drove by there was graffiti on it I believe.  They're slowly but surely making it look more maintained (working neon signs, signs in their windows, etc.) but, whew.  Don't let that hold you back.  You step inside and it's got a flat screen TV usually with some sports event on.  Many tables/booths.  They also sell home made jewlery in the restaurant which is different.  Very clean and maintained.  Professional and friendly staff.  They also serve alcohol in the restaurant!  So, yes...love Wongs.

My boss ordered a bunch of turkey subs, ham subs, and beef subs and I was addicted.  Took my boyfriend here (who was completely dedicated to ONLY getting his subs from Jimmy John's) and he is now converted!  He's always asking if we can go.  The staff here is really nice and welcoming.  They'll make you feel like you've been a regular for years as soon as you walk in the door.  Make sure no matter what, though...you always have to get your sub made "MIKE'S WAY"!!!
