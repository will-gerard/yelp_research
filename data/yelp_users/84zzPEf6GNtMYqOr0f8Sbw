Everything you would want in a tanning salon.  They help you find a plan in your budget and give discounts on all lotions.   It is very clean and well maintained.   The girls always have a smile and are always willing to help with any questions.   The p90 bed gets you brown fast!!

The employees are rude and got 2/3 items wrong in my order, then was annoyed to fix it. The guy working the ordering in the drive thru was terrible.  I won't be back.
