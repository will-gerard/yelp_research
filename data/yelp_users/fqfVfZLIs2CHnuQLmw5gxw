The absolute best flower shop in Phoenix. I could not be happier. My wife and I have a tradition of getting a flower arrangement every Friday afternoon (over a year and running) and we love the flower arrangement that we receive each week.  The team at Camelback Flowershop is so creative and talented.  Highly recommended!  See you Friday guys!

I am a CrossFit newbie and am fully impressed with CrossFit Full Strength. Gayle, Emily, and Joy have done and amazing job of coaching and teaching me the movements and helping me feel right at home with them and the other members.  Being new to Phoenix and never having done CrossFit before, I felt a little bit intimidated on day #1, not knowing what I was getting myself into and whether or not I had what it takes to get comfortable with CrossFit. They did an amazing job of helping me get comfortable right away and I am getting stronger by the day.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CrossFit Full Strength to anybody in the Phoenix area looking for a great CrossFit gym!  Thank you to the morning staff (Gayle, Emily, and Joy), you guys are doing a GREAT JOB! Keep it up!

TINA and her crew are simply -- AWESOME!!  Bookkeeping and payroll service management are a necessary detail of running a business that cannot be overlooked and missed. It needs to be done RIGHT and ON-TIME and PERFECT every time.   Explaining to an employee or a vendor a bank or anybody else as to why the numbers aren't right, or the checks weren't cut, or the myriad of excuses that a TOO BUSY business owner and UNDER-STAFFED or UNDER-QUALIFIED employee can come up with, just doesn't cut it.  Accountingprose cuts through the B.S. and simply gets it done right; all the time!  We love their EFFICIENCY, we love their INTEGRITY, we love their SIMPLICITY, we love their QUALITY, we love their PRICING.  Bookkeeping and payroll services in the Phoenix area can and should be trusted to Tina and Accountingprose. ... 'nuff said!  Thank you guys and keep up the good work!

Since Yelp requires users to provide reviews across the entire rating spectrum vs. just raving about and speaking positively about the 5 star places we all love, I am going to pick on Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers for my 1-2 star review.  Food and beverage rating: 4-5 stars Service rating: 1-2 stars  I had a chipped edge on my cocktail glass and the server said "Oh I am sorry, let me comp that drink for you" and then charged me for it anyway. When I brought to her attention the apparent mistake, she got sassy and the manager was unprofessional and lame as well. Gave me some sob story about how comped drinks come out of their pockets, like it was my fault that there was a shard of glass in my mouth and drink.  Isolated incident and the rest of their service is top notch? Probably.  Thanks Yelp for asking me to rate a few people poorly in order to provide 5-star ratings to those who deserve it. ;)

Great car wash and friendly service.  I've been coming here for years and truth be told, I used to get frustrated with the checkin process and overly-persistent up sell process.  Since the rebrand to Jackson's, things seem to be vastly improved in terms of service, employees and the overall feeling here.  The wash is great, the early bird discount is awesome, the frequent customer freebies are sweet, and the raincheck policy is very generous.  Thank you and I'll continue getting my car washed here for some time to come.
