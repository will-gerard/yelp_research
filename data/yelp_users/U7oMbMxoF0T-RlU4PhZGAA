Stay far far far away, I regret the fact I had ever moved in here.  If you enjoy the extreme summer heat, and you do not believe in showers then this is the spot for you.  Yeah free ac sounds nice, but since it work every 3 days of course it's free.  Showers? Why would you need to shower when you live in a sauna? The water is turned off every other week.  You are welcome to use your tears to wash your face and drench yourselves with sweat.The amenities sounded nice in the start, but the building is just wayyy too old, and the management company is too cheap to update anything here.  If you were sitting in the leasing office enjoying the nice ac, trust me that's the only place that has ac.  Because the rest of us are all having a heat stroke and using Phoenix children's hospital's ac.  My shrink told me I moved into such a place bc I hate myself....probably bc I didn't get enuff hugs as a child.  Btw if you have a pet, you might as well leave them in the car, bc your car probably has  better ac than your actual apartment.  And it's illegal to leave your pet in your car!

I truly enjoyed the meal i had there.  I went in for lunch and it was delicious, i had the Manila Clams to start, and the Fettuccine w/ Shrimp and Bay Scallops.  The Tilapia was also nicely done also.  Over all the service was great and i had a great time.  really want to try some more dishes.  Until next time!

Went there on a Saturday night, decided to dine at the bar because i was by myselfs.  I ordered bowl of Clam Chowder and the Main Lobster.  It took them about half an hour to bring out my chowder and during the mean time the Bongo player that was playing in the bar would not stop caughing (i feel bad for him, but they should really have just sent him home, poor judgement call on that one).    I guess over all, it was just a really slow night and no one really wanna be there.....maybe next time would be better.

Definitely an amazing restaurant, Sima and Chef Marcellino took great care of me and my date. The atmosphere is plush and romantic, i had the chef's tasting menu. Their hand made pasta is absolutely delicious.  Also on either Friday or Saturdays, they have live Opra at the restaurant which is an amazing treat.

Wow, how do i begin? I have been coming over here for the pass 6 years. I would have to say it is by far my favorite coffee shop and one of my favorite hangouts.   The location is absolutely fabulous, right by the lake with a little nice grassy area. Free Internet service for the customers there. Through out the years the place have been getting more popular with in the community, even the Starbucks workers hangout there after they get off their shift, Most importantly is the staff they hire, the owner holds this place to his heart and only hire people that is passionate about their job and very genuine (by genuine i meant they are not gonna bullshit and kiss your ass just because you are a customer) and for being in a customer service industry i love the fact that they let their employee be themselves and that's how you build a great relationship with your customer.   Now to the coffee, my favorite drink is the Carmel nut latte, amazingly delicious, if you are a new comers let them know your tastes and they will fix something conferable to ur taste.   I am not sure if they still have different art displace over their, but they use to feature local artist paint and art on their walls to promote the local art scene.   Over all this is just a fantastic establishment, i would recommend it to anyone.

The foods are kept simple there, the buffalo wings are great.  The first thing that came in my mind was "wow i can't believe this is not meat".  saw them at Devour too.  Amazing restaurant, im so glad we finally have an amazing vegan restaurant in the valley.

Drinks are reasonably priced, had an amazing time there with my friends.  Now here is the thing, i have a few friends that went before and had some what a bad experience, but they are more use to the scottsdale scene, so i guess that was the issue there.    Personally, i love the crowd there and its a great place to get shitty!

Delux Burger: Median Rare (amazing) *they can also use lettus wrap instead of the buns. Sweet Potato Fries: Delicious (but dont take it home, its kinda gross after u reheat it.) Delux Dog: Great hot dogs, specially with their mustard. Mazzarella salad: ehhh not to crazy about it.

It is by far one of the best hiking trail i have ever did.  Such an interactive trail, you will most definitely get your out door daredevil fix out here.  A few years back i was in a bad car accident and had to get a hip replacement at the age of 25.  So i decided to do the trail as a personal challenge, and now i have done it i definitely encourage people that are a little hesitant to try out this trail to give it a go.  One thing to beware of are some of the inconsiderate hikers, some people are so determined on their own hikes they would rush you or evening brush over you just to get a head.  I definitely tripped a couple times because of that.  Word of advice, just be careful and don't let those people ruined your hike. :)

I loved the Muscle starter, amazingly fresh.  Their fresh masseralla salad was very good as well.  I had the pepper steak and my date had the house pasta, just a note on the side they do have a very vegetarian friendly menu.   For desert we have the creme brulee, im not a big desert fan, but it was soooo goood!!! The servise was excellent as well.   over all it was a great experience.

If you think Donovan's is just merely a steak house then you are dead wrong.  Order a glass of wine first dish was the Shrimp Cocktail with 4 jumbo shrimp in it, and soon came the calamari.  I thought both dishes were excellent.  I ordered the Filet medium rare with Bacon wrapped scallops, and an Asparagus salad.  I would suggest next time to ask the server about the "Oscar" styled sauce on your steak.  The Scallops were fresh and tender, and obviously the steak was brilliant.  My group of coworkers also ordered Mac & Cheese on the side ( it was pretty amazing actually).  And for desert i ordered creme brulee with a cup of coffee.    Over all i had an amazing time there, i would strongly suggest everyone to give it a try :)  (and they do offer transportation with the "Donovan" if you live around the area..if its available).    Ohhh and i forgot the Lampchops!! loved it!!!

Do not call these people unless you are allergic to having money, which obviously I was. Called them early in the morning but have them unlock my apartment they said they will send a dispatch right out.  25 mins later still no sign of anyone.  Luckily my land lord showed up and let us in.  Called to cancel the service the guy is still more than half an hour out (probably didn't even leave his place yet), finds out there is a $55 cancelation fee.  First of all, they would never tell you what any of the charge will be associated with the service. Neither the phone person or the dispatch will tell you any of the hidden fee they charge, which it's smart on their end b/c they can just make up a number and charge you with it.  be very careful especially if you are in the phoenix metro area, they will not be there right way like they said.  PhoenixLocksmith is the same company as 24-7 complete lock smith.    $55 for a service that was never delivered.....what a way to do business.

Here is the update about these bloodsuckers, after disputing the charges with my credit card company they had the balls to send in fake documents to claim that I was lying about the charges.  So I provided my credit card company with all the information I can gather on them including BBB's report on them, all the print out of their website which says nothing about their cancelation policy, and all the negative review on them.  Needless to say the credit card company immediately credit back all my money.  If you have been cheated by them make sure you fight till the end.

Okay now, im not a huge Buffet fan, but this place is bloody brilliant, they have delicious amazing crab legs and a huge!! selection of different ethnic foods, such as "frog legs" "sticky rice in pineapple" amzing fresh sushi bar were the chef is right in the middle cutting and slicing up the fish.  The service was okay, but the food definitely makes up for it.  because of the high valume of guests going in and out of that place, the food is always fresh and replaced right away.  Its a big up from me and definitely go back there anytime.

I've been looking for a neighbor hood bar to call it "my bar" for the longest time, ever since i moved back from california.  The bar tenders takes good care of their guests.  The enviroment is mgnificent, the crowd there is great too.  If you are looking for a good time, and drama free place, Fibber is the place to be.

NOCA stands for North Of CamelbAck, i love this place, went with a few friends.  The foods are such a delight, Chris the Chef actually trained years in San Francisoco before coming to the valley, their duck is crips and sweet, and to top it off, their Scallops...omg it is sweet and delicious, it melts in your mouth (not a taste of dry or fishyness).  Definitely a must.  They also have a private dinning area for small parties.  I would suggest calling for the menu before going, because their menu changes daily, it enables them to serve up the freshest dishes.

I personally love this restaurant, i visit there often with my family.  Being the fact that im was born in taiwan it is a great treat to be able to have some authentic Taiwanese food.  I highly suggest the spicy wongton, it is probably one of my favorite dish in the restaurant.  I really wouldn't suggest ordering any typical dish you would usually order at any regular chinese restaurant, after all Taiwanese food and Chinese food does have it's differences.  So skip the Orange Chicken, and Beef broccoli.  Because thats not their forte.

Great great restaurant, the ahi slider is amazingly done, and you got to try the cucumber refresher, it really does reshen you up.  Although, i have heard from alot of people saying that it's not a "healthy food place" because none of their dishes are uder 500 calaries.  If thats what you are looking for, then i suggest you stay home and chew on carrot stickes.  I think the food here has a great refreshing appeal, and paired pefectly with their juices.  Definitely not the type of food thats gonna send you to the hospital with a heartattach.

Oh boy! talk about some quality "meat" dining experience. I went on a Sunday night, my friend and i are huge meat eaters, so we were ready to devour the place. The staff were really friendly and immediately seated us and told us "remember try to pace yourself", come on!? really!? i have conquered steaks after steaks who do u think you are talking to!? ( so i thought), let me just say that if you are not ready, keep your little coaster on the red side, because all the tender goodness are practically flying to your table, if you don't pace urself, you are gonna get dominated by the juicy goodness plates after plate.   I personally enjoyed every rack of meat they brought in front of us, the chicken was so so, but ..well it's chicken.   I was pretty impressed by their salad bar, the produce were fresh and delicious, if i want ready to eat an entire cow, i can definitely hangout at their salad bar all day.   Over all it was a very fulfilling and pleasant experience.

Holy food poison alarm! how the hell do u screw up chicken wings, u fried the crap out of it and sauce it.  Well not only the food was terrible the management is even worst, although we tip the server genourously only because the management seems to treat them terribly.  I think their GM's name is kyler aka mega douche, i have always liked BWW but the fact they hired this piece of human garbage make me rethink their company values.  Hopefully they can change things around and get rid of this turd eating moron.

Very interesting concept, even on a sunday night the place was quite busy.  The bartenders are hot and all have a great attitude.  The bouncers are not pushy at the door.  Didn't need to pay cover, but it was a sunday, so i am not sure if they do take cover during fridays or saturdays.  Over all i liked the atmospher and the crowd that was in there.

Oops sorry for the late review, didn't know there was a thread set up for it. \ I went to the Sunday Event and it was amazing, i don't think i've had that much fun in a while.  You will have a chance to try out all the up and coming restaurant in the valley, the big dogs and the chiwauwaus.  I strongly suggest anyone who enjoys food or just eating in general should try to attend this event next year.

After seeing a few pictures on line I've decided to check this place out.  The facility is amazing, (noted that i did not come here for the food) they have a boxing ring, corn hole, ping pong table and a Foosball table.    The drinks are great, had their mojitos, peach cobbler and a few other.    The vibe, the dance floor, the dj, and the crowd were amazing...it was a very friendly environment, you dont have to worry about pretentious dbag roaming around the bar or people that think you are just not "hip" enough.  all in all i really enjoyed this place, and will definitely come back for another adventurous night!

The restaurant contrary to alot of chinese restaurant it is a very clean establishment.  They even have an open kitchen!!!!  but if u were looking for good servise, this might be the wrong place for you, we all know with most of the authentic asian restaurant "good servise" doesn't really go with their menu. (haha just kidding, but no really the servise was just okay).  You can see the chef making the noodles from scratch through a display window it is actually cool.  If you are looking for a real "hand pulled" noodle house, this is it!!

Went in for breakfast while getting a car wash, i seated myself by the bar b/c no greeter.  waited for about a good 5 minute before they actually acknowledged me (which is a little sad, it's not like I'm terrible looking or something hahah).  Ordered steak and eggs for breakfast, bloody Mary on the side.  Steak...definitely over cooked with no presentation, just a plain slab of meat with no seasoning and some eggs.  Pretentious and over rated.  Definitely not waste your time there.  terrible service and terribly prepared food.

The service is excellent, and the atmosphere is brilliant.  I wish i have discovered this little gem a little earlier.  It is located at The Yard which is in itself is a great concept with Culinary Drop out sharing a commute out door area.    We ordered the oyster shooters to start, i personally wasn't really into oyster to begging with but thru the suggestion of our server we were able to pick out a medium size more buttery flavor oyster with their signiture home made cocktail sauce, and it was a success! LOVED IT!  And we ordered the crispy froglegs, it is unique and flavorful, the way i could discribe how it taste would be a combination between "fine chicken tenderloin with catfish" (quote from the manager Casey), and it is excatly how it taste like.    I had the king crab legs as my main course and my better half had the bouillabaisse.  i would defnitely recommend both entreys .  And for dessert we had the five spice pumpkin fritters, which was amazing, fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside.    over all i give it a 4 thumbs up!!

Tacos is the new religion.  Rushed in after work with the wifey, the minute we walked into the restaurant our mind were blown.  The concept and the theme was spectacular, we rushed in around 10:30pm thinking that their kitchen is probably closed but they actually ended up bringing out the full menu for us.  When you first walked thru the front door the entire dining hall opens up, the acoustic and the setting made me felt like im going to have some tacos with St. Peter himself.  Here are the things we had ordered, 1. 1893 Frozen Margarita. 2. Jalapeno Bacon Guacamole  LOVED IT! 3. Fresh Ceviche of the day (Shrimp and scallop!)  I had ordered all the New School Tacos and my personal favorite was the Chipotle Chery Steak, and the Peking Duck.  Just beautifully done, the texture of the steak just melts in your mouth.  Their Tortillas were so fluffy and fresh if i had a bed  made out their tortillas i would sleep on it and eat myself with it.   she had the Pork Adovada, Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef and Guild chicken. She really enjoyed the Pork Adovada out of the 3 (Old World Tacos)  They also gave us 2 free sides, the Green Chile Achiote Rice, and Crispy Poblano Onion Straws.     The service was fantastic, loved the jukebox and the restroom was pretty cool too.  I really enjoyed my experience there, and have since sent quite a few people that way, and have heard nothing but good things about it.

Friendly staff, contemporary spot, delicious bloody Mary and mouth watering dogs.  What else can i say?  Came in on a Sunday morning, thought i try the crispy breakfast dog, loved it!  The bar had "The walking dead" Marathon on.  They make their bloody Mary with pink sea salt and Okra, i also ordered a side of fried pickles to go.    loved everything about this place, definitely will be back to try the rest of the menu!
