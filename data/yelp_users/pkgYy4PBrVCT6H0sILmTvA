Visited on March 1 for dinner with a large group. It was super crowded, pretty noisy (these are things I can forgive if the food is good). Service wasn't great either, there were only 3 servers and they were working pretty hard. We waited a long time for our orders and about 2 people had to wait a really long time for their food.  The chips and salsa were eh, ok. I ordered a chicken enchilada and a beef taco, no sides. The food was bland and not too flavorful. Unfortunately, a person in our party found a hair in their taco. After hunting down our server, she quickly took it away, but there was quite a wait for the new plate.  It's cheap, but I wouldn't go back unless I had no choice.

I've been coming to Tokyo Express since I was a little girl and they have remained just as good. I freaking love the dressing on the side salad. I always order the terriyaki chicken bowl and 2 side salads. Always hits the spot!

My bestie and I went for dinner on a Wednesday. Walking from the parking lot to the door you could smell deliciousness wafting in the air. I was ready to get my grub on! We sat on the patio. It was very cute! It would be perfect for a date.   We were served some bread and ordered the three onion tarte that everyone raves about. It was good, not crap my pants good that I was expecting, but very good. It was flavorful and the crust was delicate and tasty.  For dinner we both ordered the chicken. It was cooked perfectly and the mushroom sauce was excellent. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were well done also. We cleaned our plates and were stuffed so had to pass on dessert. Maybe next time.

I wanted to love it so much!! I don't  mind the divey old school feel, I just felt the burger was not all it's cracked up to be. It was juicy, but under seasoned, so it didn't have much flavor. The other thing I didn't like was the cold bun that seemed like the cheap pack from the grocery store.   The fries and onion rings were good and I like that they serve them with ranch.   Kudos to the waitress/bartender/cook!! She was working hard and seemed to do a great job juggling everything.

Yeah, that was a $15 breakfast, that felt like a 6.99 breakfast. I have nostalgic feelings toward 5 & diner, so I'll probably still go here from time to time, but really it's not that good.   I got an omelet that wasn't very memorable, the juke box ate our quarters.

Had a really bad experience. Went with a group of 5 for dinner, service was poor, the food wasn't very good either. We spent most of our time waiting. Our appetizer was the last thing brought out, no apology, no discount, no customer service.

Although the reviews are very mixed, we decided to give it a try. I was highly disappointed.  Fried pickles were tasty, the batter was light and crispy. Very salty though.  I ordered the pulled port dinner with mashed and corn on the cob. The pork wasn't bad, but there were some large chunks of fat. Mashed was nothing special. Corn wasn't even good, kinda mushy. Tasted like it had been frozen and microwaved.  My babe ordered the brisket dinner with beans and potato salad. The brisket was awful. Tough, no beefy flavor, no smokey flavor. Honestly, it tasted old and microwaved. The beans were alright and the potato salad was inedible.   This place perplexes me. Why are the reviews on one extreme or the other? They have plaques on the wall of winning awards and I have no idea how if this is the quality they serve at competitions.  I feel pretty cheated out of my money. I don't think I would ever go back.

First time eating here and it was really good. I went with the basic gyro plate. I love meats roasted on a spit! This includes gyro meat, yellow rice, salad, hummus, pita, and portion cup of tzatziki.  It is a large portion, two people could easily share one dinner. With a drink the total was $10 and change.  Gyro meat was very flavorful! I liked the hummus. The rice was a little greasy, but not too bad. There were plenty of people here, so that's a good sign. I look forward to eating here again!

I know it's a chain, it's only semi-authentic, but I don't care!! Let me tell you why I love Abuelo's... CHIPS and SALSA-- ask for their two hotter salsas if you like it spicy. I love the one they serve warm, I think they call is "salsa brava." The chips are so thin and crisp, yum.  I also love their hand-shaken margarita, it's made with premium tequila and lime juice, not mix!!  I also always order the Monterrey platter, it's huge so you can share or take some home. Get the papas!! I don't care so much for their rice and beans.  Uhh I don't know why so many people have been disappointed. I love it!! However, I always order the same thing.

I swear they put opiates in their food to keep me coming back for more! I either come in or get take out from here about twice a month and it always hits the spot. Although I'm not gonna lie I pretty much only order 2 dishes the #18 (gai tom kah)  medium spicy and the #23 (garlic chicken) medium spicy. I've tried a couple other dishes my friends have ordered, but I crave the 18 and 23. The broth of the soup is so delicious you get the creaminess of the coconut milk, definitely lemon grass, and then the spice creeps up on you, but in a good way. It also contains chicken, a little mushroom, green onion, and some other odds and ends that you can't actually eat like leaves of some kind, the pieces of lemon grass, and wood (or at least that is what I think it is). The #23 can be ordered with your choice of protein. I always go with chicken, but I think shrimp would be awesome too. I also love the taste of their rice.  If you dine in don't expect much in the way of ambiance and you will probably have to wait about 15 minutes for your food to come out. However, it is worth the wait.

I don't think I can live without Thai Rama! As I said in my earlier review, the #18 soup is amazingly delicious! The #23 garlic chicken is probably my favorite dish! I've been ordering a different curry every time I go. The yellow curry with chicken is very good, the panang curry with beef was so good, the masaman curry is like Thai beef stew! We had the red curry with chicken once and while there was nothing wrong with it, I prefer the yellow and panang. I have yet to try the green curry.

Ordered a birthday cake "strawberry shortcake" to be exact. It was excellent! It had a good amount of strawberry filling that actually had fruit in it, not just sweet red gel that I've seen from other places. Whipped cream frosting that was nice and light, not too sweet! I am also pleased that they suggested the perfect size for the number of guests.

Looks scary from the outside, but it is good! I take out way more than I dine in. Every time I order take out, no matter how much I order, it always takes "about ten minute" :-)  The fried rice is the best around, not greasy, just delicious!! I personally like the pork or combo fried rice the best. Huge portion!   Other faves are happy family, hot and spicy shrimp, and tung-ting shrimp.

Finally went to Rogue to see my friends of the band Prague play. The sound was great, nice stage, plenty of room to watch the bands. They also projected the movie Lost Boys during Prague's set. Awesome! During the next band, Fallen Riviera, they played The Princess Bride... good choices Rogue! :-)  It's small, parking is not so good. I thought it had a lot of personality. Plenty of seating. Drinks were about $4 each. I was disappointed that we ordered kamikazes and they weren't mixed they were from a pre-mixed bottle...yuck. I also don't like that they are cash only; although, they do have an ATM inside.

Who doesn't like Four Peaks!? They have a beer for every taste and a full bar if beer is not your thing.  Hey ladies the Peach Ale is a nice non-scary "girly" beer.  The food is always delicious. Great burgers! I really enjoy both of the beer breads. Spinach dip!  The only negatives for a hungry customer are the parking and the wait, but once you get in who cares, right!?

My first time at this AZ institution and I was impressed.  It's an old school steakhouse, no frills, just solid food and excellent service. Brianna was our server and she was just cute as a button and her suggestions were spot on! Amazing service, we never went without. I would definitely request to be in her section next time. We had the living social deal which I would buy again if they offered it.  For the app we got the blackened prime rib. It was fantastic so flavorful and tender. If this was in a sandwich I'd be in heaven. Their famous roman bread was also very good.  For dinner we both ordered the porterhouse with the chipotle mac and cheese and I got the mashed cuz I'm a carb hound and he got the grilled veggies which was asparagus. Our steaks were great! OH and get the onions and or mushrooms they were amazing. My filet side was so tender. Yum! The sides were good, wish the chipotle mac had more chipotle flavor, but creamy and good.  My only gripe is that we were seated at a square table, wish is was a booth with my honey, I don't even know if they have booths, I didn't see any, but we were in the first room. Also, there was a weird side door that people kept coming through looking for the hostess stand. That kinda kills the romance, but oh well.   I would definitely go back especially if you have out of towners or say the in laws or something. It's a historic relic that serves some solid steaks!

I very much enjoyed it. Of course we had to wait, but it was worth it. Our drinks were delicious. The frozen guava margarita was very refreshing on a hot summer evening. Also the bomba was tasty and strong.  the bread and olive spread is different, I love olives so I loved it. The guac is pretty much what it's cracked up to be. A bit too chunky for my liking, but no big.   I ordered the pollo poblano and it was delicious.. that sauce was amazing. The babe got the pork tacos. I only got one little baby bite, so you know they must have been tasty.  They also had a duo playing music, so that was cool.

I've been coming here for about 12 years, the last time I was in was almost 2 years ago. I feel the quality of proteins and the teppan show have gone downhill. My scallops were not as good as I thought they should be, even had a little fishy flavor, which makes me question their freshness. Also, I felt as though the chef was rushed and just did a very basic routine. It was busy, but service was slow. I hope it was just a very busy night.

The Venetian is awesome! It's a gorgeous hotel! The room was very large compared to the other hotels I've stayed at. We were 5 ladies in a bella suite and it was pretty sweet! 2 Queens and a pretty big sofa. A lot of mirrors, which is important with a group of 5 girls! WiFi is included in your resort fee. The elevators play Phantom of the Opera! The show Phantom is closing this year :-( I saw it a couple years ago and it was great. My only minor complaint is that I ordered extra pillows and a blanket twice and the first time they brought me 4 pillows, no blanket. The next time I ordered a comforter, I was corrected that they have feather blah blah's and I'm like sure. So they bring up some sort of blanket. Not a really big deal. We went to Lavo and Tao and had a great time at both. I would stay here again.

Outstanding! We love it! It's my boyfriend's favorite burger and they serve his favorite beer!! The sweet potato fries are delicious. I love love the aoili! I put it on my fries and my burger. Cool atmosphere, just go here.    I don't know why some people are uppity about it being in a safeway shopping center. That doesn't bother me one bit. FYI uppity people its also in the same plaza as the super high end Molina Jewelers.

Champagne brunch was a bit pricey, but I think we got our money's worth. We did wait in line for a little bit maybe 20-30 minutes.   Not the best buffet ever, but good and cheaper than Wynn, Caesar's, etc, plus we were staying at PH. I preferred the American food over the more exotic choices. The yukon gold mashed potatoes were amazing!!! The prime rib was the best buffet prime rib I've ever had. Waffles were fantastic, chili very good, shrimp tempura good, and a fine selection of desserts. Made to order crepes, yum!  Our server was fabulous! She kept our glasses full of mimosas and was very sweet and attentive!!

Been here a few times in the last couple years. Always solid and never had a problem. Very cute date spot, actually the bf took me here on our first date, big points! I recommend the capricciosa(sp?) pizza and a nutella crepe with strawberries.  Parking is off the street and there will probably a wait, but it will be worth it

Not so impressed. First off, it smelled sorta funky in there.  I ordered a monterey chicken sandwich. The avocado tasted like the guacamole spread you buy at the store, not like fresh guacamole. The fries were ok, they do give you a lot though.  Three of my friends ordered the chicken pot pie. I'm not quite sure that is an accurate description of it. It was more like thick soup with two big pieces of puff pastry on the side. I didn't taste it, but they all seemed to like it.  Now, I never thought I'd be disappointed by a brownie, but I was and so were all my friends. For $7 we got a not so good brownie that tasted like it was from a box and got thrown in the microwave for a few seconds and topped with ice cream. We (5 young women) did not even finish it!    Our server and her assistant were sorta awkward, maybe they were new. At the beginning of service, my friend asked to have our checks separate and I said I had a groupon, She said it wasn't a problem. At the end, the owner came and gave us a talking to because he said it was groupon's policy that they aren't allowed to have separate checks, but he was gonna go ahead and accept it this time. WTH!? I really don't see the big deal... Good thing we had that groupon because it paid for that total disappointing dessert.   Unfortunately, I had expected better and was excited to try this place, but I don't think I'll ever go back.

Go on Monday get the $5 dollerrrr make you hollerrrr special. I got the Vigazz burger with sweet potato fries. My burger was delicious! Juicy and flavorful. The sweet potato fries were good, not awesome, they could have been a tad more crisp.  I also got a cocktail that had strawberry and basil muddled with citrus vodka and lemonade. Very refreshing! I've had this combo before and the Vig's version was superior to what I've had before. Although it was $9 it better be good, right!?

My friends and I ate here for a girls' night out. It is a bit tricky to find as you can't see it from the street. We were seated on the patio. The weather was pretty perfect and they had a little jazz band. So cute!   I was starving and ordered the empanadas. They were pretty big, full of tasty filling, and not greasy. I got the chicken breast dinner with mashed and the corn bread casserole. Portions are huge! Everything was delicious and I had to take quite a bit home. I would have liked to try a dessert, but I was so stuffed. Also, our server reminded us that tip was included in our bill. It was really refreshing that he wasn't trying to get a double tip out of us.  My only slight complaint is we had to wait a couple times for drink refills.  I look forward to coming here again and trying lunch.

Best meal of the weekend and it was lunch!!!  Service was excellent.  The potato chips with truffle oil and blue cheese were so delicious!!  Burger was juicy and flavorful. The juice was actually running down my hand. The pickles were homemade. I stole a little horseradish aoli from my cousin and it was very good with my burger. Ceaser salad was very fresh. Potato salad was very good. I heard the roast beef panini was very tasty.  We were all happily full and I and my cousin still half our orders left for later.  I've been to Spago before and after this experience I have to say I'm pretty impressed with Wolfgang Puck's restaurants.

Onstar: "Hi where can onstar take you?" Me: "Hi I need to get to Monkey Pants Bar in Tempe, AZ" Onstar:"where? Can you please spell that?" HAHAHA! Anyway, good thing I gots me some free onstar cuz the pants is somewhat hard to find in a strip mall. However, they have great drink specials and friendly servers! They have theme nights, so that's fun.   Wings were pretty good. Cheese curds are awesome! They also have some interesting burger options. Also a bacon-wrapped, deep fried hot dog!!! Say What!? Yeah that's right. I unfortunately have not ordered it yet, but a friend did and he liked it. But really, how can it be bad!?

Two of my friends raved about their burger, so I had to try it out! It did not disappoint!! Great bun, good cheese, and those crispy onions were great. I also had the fingerling potatoes which were tasty too.  We also got the cheesecake in a jar simply to find out what the hell is was all about. So, it was a small mason jar that contained a basic cheesecake "filling" for lack of a better word. They have these pre-done, then when one is ordered they top it with a strawberry jammy, compote thing, a crust crumple, and a dollop of whipped cream. It was good, but not great. They serve it in the jar, which makes it awkward to eat, so you have to maneuver your spoon around to get a bite with everything in it. I wish they would remove it from the jar or make it in a creme brulee ramekin because the sides are even.  Our server seemed young and was a little green, but not too bad. They played some pretty good music! The prices are a tad steep, but it was a memorable evening.

I went with a large group (12) for a birthday. I ordered the french onion burger and it was not as good as I remember. I feel like it had less meat. Also, our service was pretty bad. My friend Xurri R. was there with me and her review goes into much more detail. We waited very long for drinks and refills, never got any check ins. Had to ask for things and they weren't that busy.   It's pretty pricey. For 2 burgers, 1 cocktail, and 1 beer it was just shy of $50 before tip.   Also, they served our cake that we brought, but I had number candles which had been taped to the cake and they freaking lost one. My friend was turning 20-something and they lost the 2! WTH?

Long line, they always seem to be busy, but it was worth it. Great sandwich at a great price (on the strip that is) but really not much more than like Jimmy John's , it is similar to how quizno's does sandwiches, but so much better. The bread is the star.  Rundown: Italian: delicious Potato Salad: meh not memorable, but we were starving and needed something now Mac and cheese: really good for fast food  Overall: I'd go back

Not horrible, maybe I've been here on bad nights. Drinks are expensive and bartenders are inattentive. I suggest getting an Adios M.F. because it is $13 and served in an OJ carafe, so you only need one. We also discovered go for the bottle of beer for $2.50 rather than the draft for $7. The draft is only a couple ounces more, so get yourself 2 bottles!

We stopped in before the movies across the street for a sake bomb and some sushi. My side of the table was sticky, eeewww. And the sushi was very underwhelming, the quality was not great, especially for the price. Even the miso soup was weird and frothy. At least we didn't get food poisoning. We will not return.

Solid place for Chinese. Good size portions. I will agree with other yelpers that their side of steamed rice is very small. Prices are going rate about $10 an entree.  We ate in for a late dinner. We ordered beef chow fun, pork fried rice, and creaky chicken. They also gave us a cup of soup and a little dessert thing that was like a wonton wrapped banana topped with honey and sesame.  The chow fun was fantastic. The beef was super tender!! The other dishes were very good also. I was pleasantly surprised by the little sweet snack at the end of the meal.

Absolutely delicious! As soon as we arrived, we were treated well by the staff.  Crusty bread and butter was promptly brought out with water.  The mushroom soup was decadent and rich, I've never had anything like it. The salad was fresh and tasty, I don't usually care for beets and these were great. My love and I shared the filet mignon and scallops with a side of au gratin potatoes. The scallops were the best I have ever tasted and they were served in a lobster butter sauce that was scrumptious. The filet was melt in your  mouth delicious.  And the piece de resistance was the chocolate tower. Ours had a raspberry sauce on the bottom, along with the vanilla sauce. The chocolate mouse was perfect, the presentation beautiful.  We will be back some day! It is a special occasion restaurant for our budget.

Not impressed. We came on a recommendation and were not pleased.   The good: $5 sake bombers  The miso soup was fine, but pricey. I ordered a regular side salad which was $3.99 and what I got was a small amount of very cheap American blend (iceburg, cabbage, carrot). It shouldn't have been served, it looked old and it tasted like dirt, no flavor of dressing at all.  The sushi was fine, but small quantity for the price.   I don't think we will return.

A little different than I'm used to, but pretty tasty! I had take-out.  I ordered the chicken coconut soup. Really good flavor, served piping hot. I appreciate the chunks of mushroom and tomatoes. I order the gai tohm kah from Thai Rama and it was pretty close, but not spicy. Now that I know I can order it spicy next time.  I also got the spicy garlic chicken. It had fancy sliced carrots and bell peppers in it. Very yummy. It had just a hint of spicy. They didn't ask me how I wanted it, so I just went with it. I could have taken it a little hotter, but no big deal.   I'm so happy it seems I've found a trusty Thai place on the westside! I saw several people with pad thai, it looked really good...maybe next time!

I would give them 2.5 stars. We did a last minute teppan date. There was just one other couple at our table. Our chef was very good, but since we were a small table and the older couple with us didn't interact with him at all, so our "show" wasn't the best I've ever seen.   The food was typical, miso soup, salad, 2 shrimps each, choice of protein, and choice of rice. The food was adequate, good, but not great. My steak was a bit tough even though I ordered medium rare. If in the the far west valley it's a nice change of pace, but nowhere near as good as my personal fave sapporo in North Scottsdale.

A great date spot!  We started with a couple cocktails. I had the Frenchman and it was good, too tart for my beau. He had a dark and stormy, which was really special. Their homemade ginger ale it delicious, so flavorful!  We ordered two of the tacos, they were ok, but nothing exciting. The mac and cheese was amazing! I must try!  For dinner we split the chicken and waffles. The place included 3 good sized pieces of chicken. It was the perfect amount of food for two given we had 2 starters. The chicken was extremely juicy with the most amazingly crunchy skin. The waffle was a white cheddar waffle what was delicate yet complex.  A great dinner and we will be back for mac and cheese!

I bit pricey for the portion size on 3 of 4 dishes, but overall pretty good.   I got the Camparita cocktail. So delicious!! Fresh squeezed citrus makes me so happy. I love margaritas, but can't stand fake lime mix.  We ordered the salad with egg, the like a caprese app. They were both good, the portion was kinda small on the salad. I really liked that the basil component of the caprese was a pest rather than whole leaves like it is traditionally served. The bread was phenomenal.  For main courses we got the gnocchi . The gnocchi itself was so delicious, light and fluff like eating a cloud. The sauce was good, but I really didn't get the fennel or sausage in it. We also ordered the Amatriciana which was good more spicy than I expected. The meat was a little on the sparse side, but overall a good dish.

Holy Crap they've done a lot with this place! Having grown up in this neighborhood, I remember this building being Katz deli. Man it is so different from the yellow brick deli in my memory.  Of course we ordered the bruschetta:  fig, mascarpone, and prosciutto- so good! I love sweetish/savory combos and the rich, creamy mascarpone was the perfect compliment. Warm artichoke- good salami and pesto- really good, simple. I really like their pesto tomato, basil, mozzarella- really nice, classic. The sea salt very complimentary, gives a pop of flavor  I ordered the autostata panini on focaccia. Oh how I love Italian deli meats. So good. Huge portion. I took half home and it was still so good for lunch the next day. I tied my friend's nine iron and it was also really good.   All in all very good!

I have been wanting to come here for quite some time now. It was a busy Saturday night, but service didn't suffer.  We ordered some beers, steak panzanella salad, and the "famous" salsiccia pizza.  The salad had much more steak than I expected, cooked nicely and flavorful. Not a shining star, but good.   The pizza was heaven. The dough was so light and fluffy like eating a cloud. Flavorful sausage and the other toppings make for a delicious pizza. We will be back for sure!

Still pretty freaking good. We shared the mozzarella corrozza salad. It was very good! The fried mozzarella was delicately fried, not greasy or heavy like a mozzarella cheese stick. The Prosciutto was high quality and delicious.   We had a funghi pizza and we are both crazy about mushrooms. We loved it. Every component worked together fabulously. I still don't know how they make the crust so damn light and fluffy.  We are customers forever.

We ordered 2 of my favorite dishes, panang curry with beef and the tom kra gai (coconut milk soup with chicken). They were both very good, I would go back again. We ordered medium and it was not as spicy as I like it so next time I might go with hot. The rice bowl was very small and we had to ask for for, but no big deal.  The restaurant itself is nice and clean and can't wait to try other menu items!

What is the concept here!? The apps lean toward Mexican/Latin inspired, the mains and side dishes are American, and the desserts are a little of everything.  First off the bread. Cold! Butter, ice cold. The small round french-type bread that was so chewy my jaw was sore. The second bread was a pretzel like bread shaped like a baguette, it was ok.   I ordered the chicken and it was served with mashed potatoes and a little bit of green beans. It was good, but nothing to write home about. I tasted the chili rubbed skirt steak and it was also good, but still not blowing me away.    Service was pretty slow. The brownie dessert was nothing special, but it was complimentary since we were celebrating a birthday.     Overall, I am pretty disappointed by my experience here. Except the decor, I really loved the chandelier. They do not have a restroom in the restaurant, so you can either go up an elevator to the club bathroom (what a waste of electricity) or walk out to the bathroom in the crystals center.

I'd bet they do most of their business during the week with a nice slice and drink special. We went in on a Saturday afternoon, it was dead. We got 4 slices, a dozen wings, and 2 small drinks. The bill was almost $22! What!? They had a special for a dozen and a medium pie and it was cheaper or about the same price. I pointed it out right after we paid and there was no reaction for the guy behind the counter. I think that's a fail on their part to suggest we look at the specials.  When we sat down, the sun hit the tables in such a way that I could see that they hadn't been cleaned. You could see the leftover parm and red pepper bits on the table. It was empty except us and 2 other people came to eat in and one to take out. There were 3 guys working that I saw. They had time to wipe down tables.   The slices were pretty huge, I probably should have ordered one. We got 3 pepperoni and mushroom and one cheese. The pizza is pre-made and they just warm it, however they did not put the toppings on before they fired it, they did it after. The pepperoni was limp and greasy since it just got residual heat from the pizza. The shrooms are canned! Ugh! I much preferred the cheese and barely ate any of my pep and shroom.   The wings are tiny and we ordered hot, it was not hot at all. The wings were crisp, but nothing special at all.  refills on drinks are 50cents.   I would not go back

The restaurant is very nice on the inside compared to the outside. I nice place for a date.  I ordered the tom kah gai and it was very flavorful, not quite as rich with coconut milk as at Thai Rama, but still very good. I ordered medium and this is probably closer to hot. As I ate, I noticed these things I thought were green onion, on further examination, they were small sliced chili peppers. Their rice was nit as fluffy as I usually like, but that's ok. I also got the red curry because the server said it was their most popular curry. Again, very flavorful and tasty. Service was very good, although, they weren't busy at all. Iced tea, was good. I would go again!

On the hunt for a go to nail shop. They have tons of gel nail colors and on the swatches they have the brand so if you are picky about that or looking for a specific color it would make it easier to find.  Good solid basic pedi. They have everything clearly listed on what you get. I would go back. Reasonable prices, $18 pedi, $20 gel mani

I would probably give it a 4.5.  The sticky buns are all they're cracked up to be!! Delicious. I ordered the filet and it was delicious and like butter. I ordered it medium rare, I know it's not how ladies usually order it... I even got a double ask from the server; honestly, I wouldn't go above medium to keep the integrity of this fine cut of meat. The scalloped potatoes were pretty great too! My date ordered the special of the night prime rib with southwestern mac and cheese. It was very good, but my filet was better.   The patio with this weather was absolutely perfect! I would go again for a special occasion.

What better place to go on Halloween weekend than a haunted hotel bar, right!? Wrong! This place has so much potential, especially on Halloween, but they are not doing something right. The music was bad. Staff was not very friendly, except the door guy, he was cool! Not very many people. Needless to say, we didn't stay very long.  A definite lack of imagination and marketing!!! Really, this place should be poppin' for Halloween, it's a freaking haunted hotel and the bar is called ghost lounge!! Today I checked out their website and they serve food and have specialty drinks. Ummm, I didn't see any menus on Saturday, if I had, I probably would have ordered a specialty drink and they would have made a few extra bucks off of me! Such poor marketing and planning!   Our drinks were only $4 each!! Pretty cheap. However, I ordered a sex on the beach and what I got was not what I expected. I googled it and apparently there is a version that has midori in it, but I was expecting vodka, peach schnapps, oj, and cran.   I will give this place another chance and I hope I have a better experience next time!

Shakes! Shakes! Shakes! Shakes! Shakes! Errryyyybody (repeat).  Banana's Fosters shake is not getting the love it deserves here on yelp. Let me tell you it will rock your socks!!! Caramelly, banana, topped with delicious whipped cream. So yummy!!!  I ordered the Samburger. It was very tasty. Our server forgot to ask me how I wanted it cooked and so did I, so anyway it was a little more done than I usually order, but that's ok. It was still pretty juicy. I stole some avocado from my friend's turkey burger and I have to say it was a great idea.   I was disappointed by the sweet potato fries, they weren't too crispy and the flavor was very subtle, almost too subtle. I also didn't care for the sauce.  I will definitely come again for the shakes and burgers. I will give the fries another shot..the truffle ones sound very good.  P.S. Everyone who works here is so fit and very nice from what I experienced :)

I liked it more than the dude did, but in the land of chains that the west valley is, it was very nice to find a mom and pop.  I got the chicken fried steak, eggs, and biscuits and gravy. The portion of b and g is enormous! I thought the plate she brought out was for us to share, nope she came back with another. Next time, I think we could split the one side of b and g and pick a different side. I found it good, not amazing. The dude wanted more sausage in his gravy.

So expensive for such small portions...they must be high! That was the least filling $120 lunch I've ever had. There were 4 of us and it came out to $30 each.  Chips and salsa: I appreciate the warm chips. The salsa had and ok flavor, but lacked some freshness. Maybe it needs cilantro or onion.  Tacos: We ordered 3 different of their tacos(pancita, cochinita, and barbacoa). Nothing special in the way of flavor. Every taco had a chunk of fat in it. And at $9 for 2 tiny tacos that adds up.   Lamb potstickers: meh, not really anything better than you would get in the frozen bag. They were light on flavor. We asked for some sort of sauce and the waiter obliged, but reminded us that that sauce doesn't normally come with the order. The sauce added sssooo much. If it weren't for the sauce I would have had a hard time eating it.  Gazpacho something: a fruit salad. This was very good, but again a very small portion.  Tuna ceviche: I didn't eat this because I don't like tuna, but from what a heard one of the better dishes of our lunch.  Shrimp mojo: recommended by the host, it was pretty good, but really oily.   Overall: I wouldn't go back.

Pleasantly surprised!   Service was upscale. Ambiance was ok. It was a bit noisy and there were many more kids than I would have imagined. A lot of AZ tuxedos (polo/button down and shorts with sandals).   It was cool to see the chefs cooking your meal in front of you! We had a white sangria and a strawberry margarita. Both were very good, but I don't think my marg had much tequila.   The cheese plate was exceptional, the pairings were spot on. Be careful, the blue cheese is very strong, so that might be off putting for some. We both like a good funky cheese so it was all good. My fave was the goat cheese and tomato spread.  For dinner I ordered the chicken and the man ordered the ribeye. My chicken was surprisingly very delicious and moist, as were the sides. My green beans were a little crunchy for me, but still good. The steak and gouda mac were fabulous! High quality beef cooked very well.  We skipped dessert.  The layout of the menu didn't make sense. They have a burger and a pasta dish under appetizers.. Maybe they need to divide that section into apps and small plates.

I've been to multiple locations and never had such a bad experience. It was lunch and this was the slowest I've ever seen an oregano's. We came in for lunch on my boyfriend's birthday. They got my order wrong and my boyfriend's big beef sandwich was absolutely inedible. It was so greasy, I tried to drain it off but it just soaked through the napkin. It was so greasy you could squeeze it and grease poured out of it. I tried to get our servers attention more than once to alert her of our issues, but she never came around. Finally, we were so hungry that we had to split my sandwich I didn't order. I overheard our server comp the table behind us a pizza cookie who were also celebrating a birthday. We ended up paying for a whole meal we didn't eat. I will never come back to this location.

Restaurant Week FAIL! I was so excited to try Betty's and besides the mushrooms I wouldn't return. We had looked at the RW menu beforehand and were both going to get the steak. When I was ordering the server informed us that the steak was over peppered in prep and was being sent back all night so we should get something else :( I give her credit for being honest, but the house should have substituted a different steak or something. We still payed the same amount for something we didn't want to order.  Anyway the mushrooms and wine were good. We got the angry shrimp and Italian sausage. They were both tasty and I would return for happy hour drinks and shrooms. Dinner was unmemorable and dessert was ok. I got the pineapple upside down cake and is was served cold which I didn't enjoy much, I wish it were room temp. He got the chocolate peanut butter cheesecake. Good flavor, dense and very rich, we didn't finish it.   The live music was nice, but overall not impressed with the layout or menu other than the mushrooms.

I will say that the club itself is new, so it is nice inside (once you get inside). They get great talent, so it doesn't matter who I saw, but I did go to the late show of Joel McHale. I'm not commenting on the show as it will vary on who you see and your own preference.   My experience was not good, the club showed a lack of organization/management. The show was supposed to start at 9:45 I don't think it started till 11. I'm totally laid back and can handle not being on time, but that is pretty late especially when we have been standing in line outside for 2 hours because their seating is first come first served (lame). When we finally got seated we were at a high top half booth, half table situation along the wall. I thought this was a good spot in the house because we could see and were not all cramped up in the center tables.  Now for service...TERRIBLE! We ordered our drinks and 2 desserts. The beers were warm, hard to drink! As I struggled to guzzle it down quick so it wasn't even warmer, I wondered when they put these on ice... We never got out desserts. I saw her write it down, no apology was made. So I'm pretty irritated, by the time she comes around to check on us, it's already into the headliner and I don't wanna be eating now.  Parking was $10, Coors light/ Bud Lights were $5, $3 for iced tea, $8 for gin and tonic.  I wouldn't go back unless somebody I really wanted to see was having a show, but this is what we're left with. I sure am going to miss the Tempe Improv!

I wanted to like it but I've had better. The people were as nice as can be, and very clean, but the service wasn't the best. Small selection of colors both regular and gel. My pedi was ok, but I can notice that she missed some top coat. My gel mani is very very thick, too thick. Also, she cut me pretty bad and I didn't really notice how bad til I have this big ugly scab. She knew she cut me and I didn't see any blood, I felt stinging and she put some of that green stuff on it and said it was t help moisten and nourish my skin, not disinfect cuz she cut me. Oh well, you win some you lose some. My eyebrow wax was adequate, but she didn't trim them only wax.

Visiting at the hospital across the street and decided to order some take out. The pork fried rice was very tasty, the beef and broccoli was very fresh and good, as was the combo chow mein. Service was very fast.

Thank goodness for the groupon!! Not bad, but not really very good eithe  We ordered the shrimp fundido. It was just a bowl of melted cheese with shrimp in it. Pork green chile, tender meat, ok flavor, wish it was spicier or something. The poblano burger was ok.  Good beer selection, but our sever forgot my beer and when I informed her, she brought me the original beer they poured me... mmmm nothing like warm beer.

I decided to get a full face wax, before this I have only done eyebrows and lip. My technician was a very nice person, but I wasn't really impressed with her ability and she had only been with the company for 3 months.   My eyebrows looked pretty much the same when I was done, my side burn area is uneven, and she had to do my lip area more that once. I ended up with a pretty bad reaction and was all red and "pimply."  On the plus side, I didn't really hurt that bad, the nose hair wax is very interesting, not painful at all, much to my surprise.   They do try to sling products and do the whole I recommend you come back in X weeks like you are at a Dr's office to get a follow-up. I turned it all down and walked out sans appointment and unnecessary products.  I would give this company another try, but maybe request a more experienced tech.

I had been to the Arrowhead location and really like it, they have all the same things, except I think I just got the wrong tech.  Tons of gel mani colors!  My tech missed some edges, like the far sides and I didn't notice til later, so that kinda sucks. Also there's a couple little bubbles or something in my gel mani. Not enough to be noticed by anyone but me, but it still irks me because I paid good money for my mani and pedi.   I would give them another try because of the gel polish choices, but I would have a different tech, but I think I will try at least one other place before that happens.

For eyebrow wax only! I just happened to desperately need brows waxed and was passing by. Great and affordable experience $10. She trimmed and waxed. I'm very pleased! The rest of the salon was large with lots of chairs and seemed very clean.

A little more expensive, but worth it. Super clean and like others have said you get a liner for the pedi bowl, so that's worth it. $22 for the classic pedi which includes hot stones and hot towel.   $25 for gel mani and they have the most color choices I have ever seen! I really liked my mani. I would go back!

It was a busy Saturday and I was with a friend, I did like that they were able to do my mani and pedi at the same time so that my friend and I (who just got a pedi) were done at the same time. However, my pedi was not very good...she rushed through it. I don't even remember the massage. I'm pretty sure they overcharged me too, but I didn't say anything. Oh well, I don't think I'll come back here.

Not impressed. I was with a large group, so that might have been that. I was late and everyone else had already ordered. The server acknowledged me as the straggler or so I thought. I asked for a drink menu and a regular menu and he gave me the drink menu and he came back to the other end of the table a couple times leaving me still drink-less. After that he didn't ask about food and one of the guys in my party went up to him to tell him I was still looking to order. Everyone else received their food before I even ordered. I should have just given up right there, but I was starving. I ordered the apocalypse sow with salad. Not as good as I expected. I felt it was dry and lacking flavor. The aoli was just plopped in the middle. The meat was crumbling and I had to just eat it with a knife and fork. Should have just got the soup.

Love it!!! First tasted it at the Matsuri festival and was blown away. I haven't strayed to much from from my original selection although I swear every time I go I will try something new the taro flavor always gets to me. I love the taro with condensed milk and mochi.

Definitely in the top 3 burgers I've ever had. High quality ingredients and lots of beers on tap!  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen and it was great! My only suggestion would be to fan out the jalapeno and avocado more so it's not all in the middle. The meat was high quality and cooked just like I ordered it. The bun looks like it would be dense but it's this light fluffy little cloud of heaven! The truffle Parmesan fries were very good too, but we got so full on the burgers we didn't finish the fries.  I would definitely go back!

FABULOUS!!! I had an amazing first time wax experience! I was pretty nervous about doing a Brazilian, but D'Lisa is freaking awesome!! Not awkward, she explains as she goes. Definitely did not hurt as much as I expected! I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for this service!  I look forward to future waxes and other services.  The salon itself is smaller, nicely decorated, and very clean! The parking is in the back and could be tricky because it's a bit limited, but I had no trouble.

BACON! The bacon is the shining star! We went later around 12-12:30 on a Sunday, so we only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. There were about 2 other couples waiting after us and then there was no wait to be seated. So going later could be a good tactic; however, the specials had run out, so as long as you don't care about that, you got it made.  I ordered the hog and chick with home fries, The bacon is the bomb, thick and delicious, the home fries are also so flavorful, and my scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly.  You also get a large slice of buttered toast and jam.  The man had the chop and chick and a side of bacon with home fries. I tried the chop and it was good, but a little over cooked (dry) in my opinion. He also had the strawberry honey lemonade which was delicious! I can't order drinks with no refills because I drink a lot, so I had the iced tea.   Overall, very good! I wouldn't wait 2 hours to be seated though, I'd come back for the bacon!

I love it for a easy take out. We always get the family special with Hot and Hawaiian. The flavoring on the fries is so good and the ranch dressing... OMG I would buy just the ranch dressing my the gallon, I love it! Yes my fries get a bit soggy on the ride home, but yeah it's take out.

Going downhill quick. The last few times we've ordered, fries have been undercooked, items forgotten, under seasoned fries. I hope they get it together! Our kid loves it and it's one of the few take out places we get.

Great experience all around!  I really wanted to go to Craft Steak, but they were closed for remodeling, so we opted to try Tom Coliccho's new venture, Heritage Steak.  Staff from the moment we entered were friendly and attentive! I wish they had more romantic seating options, like booths or larger tables, so couples could sit on the same side, but no big deal. We were seated at a half booth half chair situation.  Now to the food.  Bread and butter: very delicious, I loved the large grains of salt on the butter. Wish butter was not so cold so it would spread a bit nicer  quail skewers: good, but wouldn't order it again. We hadn't tried quail so now we have. Tastes like dark meat chicken, nice flavor from the fire, but nothing I'd rave about  Bone in ribeye: Best steak I've ever had! Cooked and seasoned simply, letting the meat be the real star. Cooked perfectly (medium rare) and rested perfectly!! No blood or juice running out all over the plate. Amazing flavor and tenderness!  Potatoes: the ones it comes with, good little potatoes  Onion rings: Best I've ever had!!! Great flavor, seasoned to perfection, maybe a bit on the spicy side for non spicy eaters. Served hot out of the frier. Very crispy (they do lose some crunch as they get cooler, but I didn't mind) and the dipping sauce was phenomenal too.  Banana bread pudding, so good! The sauce on the bottom and bruleed banana slices were fantastic.  Overall: A phenomenal meal, pretty reasonable prices by Vegas famous chef standards. I'm now very excited to try craft steak next time we are in Vegas.

We've been here twice and I hope it stays open! It was a nice change of pace in the area and lots of beers on tap. I prefer it to Native New Yorker which was in this spot previously.   I was craving BBQ chicken pizza. I don't know if we ordered incorrectly or not but we got buffalo chicken pizza, Oh well we ate it anyway. It was tasty, the chunks of bleu cheese really made it!  The second time we actually ordered and got the BBQ chicken pizza. It was very good too, but I would suggest a thicker BBQ sauce and I would probably sub red onion for green.

Not as fancy as Soporro, but makes up in price and taste!  We ordered teppan for 2, which included 4 choices of proteins.. I'm sure you could order double of 2. Anyway, we chose filet, shrimp, scallops, and calamari.  You get the usual soup and salad to start. They offer you 2 sauces, both delicious! Our chef was good, not the most impressive I've ever seen, but fun and cooked our food to perfection.  Everything was wonderful! The steak was like butter! We will definitely return!

An amazing date night experience! The food was high quality and fresh! Everything was delicious. We ordered the ying yang pot(choice of 2 broths) with the Ma long(spellling) spicy and the coconut curry. Both were fantastic but the spicy one is pretty spicy. Our proteins were shabu beef, New York beef, pork belly, and shrimp. We also got some veggies and noodles.   Chef and owner was a really cool guy and stopped of at our table a few times throughout the night. You can tell how passionate he is about the ingredients he uses.   This would be a great place for the whole family imo. You can teach your kids about the foods and they can watch them cook.   We are already planning our next trip!
