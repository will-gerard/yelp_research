Old school country music with great drink prices!  Great spot after a Spring training game! Always a good time!

Came here for karaoke and great drink prices as we heard through Yelp but we were very disappointed by the service of the bartenders and the servers.

I give their tacos about a 4. However, their service  barely deserves a 2. I have been to the Scottsdale location for Taco Tuesday several times now and every time I am highly disappointed by their service. You might ask "why does she keep going back" and the answer would be because I always have high hopes that the next time they will improve... But that's not the case. I would stay away from Loco Patron on Taco Tuesday and save your money for a place with better service.

Fun place to go on a date! Wednesday nights have half priced games and after 10pm they have a decent happy hour for drinks. If you're a night owl this is the place to be on a Wednesday night for an all around good time for a reasonable price.
