This is perhaps some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Their "VIP" care plan is hardly worthy of the name; broken furniture from manufacturer and promises of fixing/picking up that never happen.  I was routed to their 800 number instead of anyone at the store . When the call center people confirmed dates and times to pick up and issue a full store credit, it never happened. Horrible communication skills. Do what you say you are going to do!  American Furniture Warehouse is looking VERY good right about now. Save your time energy and money. I came here for convenience since I live in DC Ranch, and next time I'll make the drive to Glendale AFW.   I'm standing in line as I speak listening to some of the same horror stories... Beware!!

Wish I could give them an extra star. Nick, Owner, went ABOVE AND BEYOND to make our first experience a home run.  Fabulous food, great drink menu and exotic dinner specials. Best restaurant in Phoenix in my opinion.  Thanks Nick, we will be back!

Used to love going to this place until I ordered a beef dipped with hot.. Got home .. Took a bite and had a long piece of hair... At this point I was already at home and called a manager there. They agreed to give me a new sandwich but at this point I lost my appetite. Please focus on the quality , not quantity !!!!!
