We like to occasionally have breakfast at the IHOP on Central in Phoenix on the weekends because it's pretty close to home, and it's one of the newer IHOPs. Pretty clean inside,  We both like to order the Chicken Fajita Omelette with the wheat-grain pancakes...Very good.  I sometimes order it with all egg whites.  The poortions are are a nice size. Always feel full when we leave there.  The Good Egg just up the street...the portions are always small and I would not feel full when leaving there, and it's about the same prices as IHOP.  So, I highly suggest IHOP over The Goog Egg all the way.  So what that it's more gay at the Good Egg....These queens just don't know better!

I am only giving -THIS- location a 1 star because of their horrible early hours!! They close like at 7 pm during the week, & they already closed at 3 pm on Sunday! ...I was pissed! The new Chipotle a block away at City scape is open til 10 pm daily! ...So there! What is it with everything closing sooo damn early in Phoenix! This is such an early city! Some eating places even close at 2:30 pm, like The Good Egg & First Watch... They wouldn't DARE close that early in LA because they would lose a lot of profit!  (...I am from LA).

We like baja Fresh, but this particular location gets 1 Star, due to their crazy unstable hours of being open!  They seem to close whenever they want! If it's not busy, they'll just close! ...esp, on the weekends!, they will close like at 2 PM!!!...I feel this is so stupid, considering that the Light Rail is literally right at their front door & people are getting off it like every 10 mins, so they are just losing money, & with all of the Theatre & Sports Events,...they are totally forgetting all of that, too.   Chipotle is just a few blocks away at Cityscape & they are open til 10 pm,,,,every single night, period!  ...Just go there instead.

At McDowell, near 7th Avenue, we always like to get their Greek Salad with Grilled Chicken added. It's pretty hearty & we love their Greek Salad Dressing....yummy!  ....Kinda don't like sitting on their hard plastic chairs though.  :(

On 2 separate trips to this particular location, they ran out of white meat chicken! That is totally unacceptable! Also, when they DO have chicken, it always seems to be just lukewarm instead of piping hot, I wish Phoenix had KOO KOO ROO Chicken like they do in LA....They are way better than Boston Market.

QDOBA on Central, Park Central Mall - 9/24/13, Tues @ 11:30 am... I was waiting in line for over 10 mins, when I finally got to the girl, she told we they we out of chicken! I don't eat meat or pork, so I ONLY wanted chicken. I flat out said, "Good-Bye!" to her & walked out,  as I was walking out, I made sure that I told everyone in line that they were out of chicken. I was very upset!  NO restaurant should ever run out of something like chicken! I would think that a restaurant would be or even should be embarrassed to be running out of a 'staple' such as chicken, don't you think? and the girl was so nonchalant about it, too.

LOVE THIS PLACE!  ...Excellent food & even better...excellent service!  ...On 10/18/2010, Mon night, we had dinner here. I ordered the Grilled Salmon with Brown Rice.  It was only lukewarm, and I like my food hot.  I told the waiter & his apologized & they cooked me a brand,new one that was fresh & hot. He gave me another salad on the House to eat while I was waiting for the 2nd one. ...But wait, it gets better... He totally took it off the bill!  ...I didn't have to pay for my dinner!  How cool is that?  This is one of our favorite places to eat for sure!  This is a quint little place to eat, decorated very nicely. It can get somewhat noisy in there, but the food & service makes it worth it!   :)

Well, we went back for a 2nd time, & this will be the last time we go to Scott's Deli.... It was over 100 degrees today and the AC was not working...It was VERY warm in the restaurant which made our dining experience pretty miserable.  They had all of their ceiling fans on at full blast in the backroom which dried up my contact lenses & our napkins would keep flying off the table. We got the Greek Omellete and the cucumbers in it were bitter...had to take them all out. The waiter never even said 'I'm sorry"......  I am from LA and there are faaar better Deli's there than here in Phoenix!  This deli was pretty average, nothing like Jerry's Deli, or Canter's Deli in LA....NOW we're talkin'!   On a side note, I am so sick & tired of ALWAYS seeing sports on TV's in restaurants! ...Okay for sports bars, or maybe Applebee's, but it is like everywhere you go! It would be refreshing to actually see a movie playing on a TV at a restaurant....Something that the whole family can enjoy watching, just saying. :)

One of the better Mexican Restaurants in Phoenix & one of my favorites. A very good selection here, I like that they have a Chicken Mole dish, which seems hard to find.  Waaaay better than the overrated Manual's & that Tee Pee Mexican place, which are more like on the level of Del Taco....ew!

I like this Baja Fresh, but this location is going down hill... The staff seems to change a lot, always new people in training... High turn over rate. They seem to mess up on special orders so beware.... They speak Spanish to each other a lot and makes us feel uncomforatable, makes me think they're talking about us.... and it's just plain rude!  My biggest complaint is that they were swepting the floor right next to our table, literally right on top of our feet...It's like EXCUSE ME,  I am trying to eaty here! I don't want dust flying up into the air and landing on my food! They have done this there a few times now!  Why do they have to sweep & mop right next to the customers! It's annoying & insanitary I feel...  The ceiling fan s were also on full blast, further stirring up all the dust!

Souper salad is just OK....  Sweet Tomatoes is waay, waay better!  I don't mind forking out a few more dollars at Sweet Tomatoes because it is higher quality & a better selection, and everything just seems fresher than at Souper Salad.  I am highly disappointed at the frozen yogurt at Souper Salad...It is that low-quality ice milk garbage! Sweet tomatoes is creamy & delicious!

Not sure what all the hype is about for this place.....Very average.... The food seemed similar to Del Taco, but on a real plate. The Fajitas was a joke....This place looks run down & old, which scares me a little bit to eat here. Canyon Cafe/Sam's Mexican Cafe at Arizona Center downtown....NOW we're talkin'!  ...Waaaaay better!

.....Sorry but, I still feel that IHOP, just down the street on Central is waaaaaay better than The Good Egg by FAR!  You get more food for the same price... The portions at Good Egg are not that big.... I have left there still hungrry in the past. ...Try IHOP, guys!  You'll leave more stisfied!  ;P

...I was reading some of the reviews people left here for the Good Egg & I am not getting it!  ..um, people....The Good Egg is really not that great! It over-priced & you really don't get a whole lot of food!  It always seems cold or lukewarm, too.  Please try IHOP just down the damn street on Central. Believe me, it is way better than Good Egg. IHOP just seems more fulfilling & heartier...  The Chicken Fajitia Omellette with the Harvest Nut & Grain Pancakes is delicious & satisfying.  A 2nd runner-up would be breakfast at FEZ across the street & up a bit up on Central!....Yes, I said breakfast (or Brunch)....Very nice & unique breakfast selections on their menu!  :)

Do NOT go here! Save your money! They will close early if they feel it is not busy enough. We attempted to go here for dinner TWICE and they had closed early...The 3rd time was a charm, but the place itself is NOT!. They had live music, a Mexican Group playing cha-cha music, which was horribly loud! The Chips were stale, & the salsa wasn't really salsa...it was more like hot sauce. I ordered the Albongdigous (Meatball) Soup...It was lukewarm at best. The Chimichunga was just okay... Jim's tacos were too spicy for him...  Baja Fresh is way better than this place!...just sayin'.

CIINA-BEAR is located in Park Central Mall. It is a hidden gem, hiding inside of this outdoor mall. They having amazing muffins, made from SCRATCH on the premises! (unlike Starbuck's pastries). The muffins are oversized which you can easily ill up on one. It doesn't stop there...They also serve lunch items. The specials change daily. I highly recommend this little place tucked away inside Park Central Mall. They are only open Mon-Fri though, and close at 4 pm. You order at the window & you can eat at the nearby tables or just have it to go .  :)

Sorry, but I HATE this pathetic place! usually full of total losers, yet it gets pretty crowded. Poor phoenix, people just don't know better in this city. It's kinda sad, actually. Then when an a super cool & totally fun Event comes to Club STRATUS on 23rd Ave near Grand, hardly anyone goes! It's way better, more modern & no rif-raf losers. It is more 'Circuit party-ish", which Phoenix lacks, otherwise, you would have to leave the damn state to attend a Circuit Party Event, which is pretty much nonexistent in AZ.

It took about 15 minutes before the (flamboyant) waiter finally took our order! I ordered the overly -priced grilled, blackened salmon for $14.45. First of all, it arrived NOT blackened, so I had to send it back...When it came back, it was hardly even blackened at all! The portion size was sooo small and lookied NOTHING like the picture on the menu! (Reminded me of like when you buy a TV dinner at the store, and the picture is nothing like what's inside the package). There were hadly any veggies as well as the brown rice... I left there still hungry, actually...Their portions always seem to be on the small size, but their prices are far from small. The waiter must have said "I'm sorry" literally 10 times. It was getting annoying, actually. Their muffins, on the other hand, are great.

We had a 2-for-1 print out, good for up to $6.00, so we decided to come here for lunch and get sandwiches last Saturday.  On the menu board, there were 3 post-its on it saying "Out of Sandwiches". They told us that they stop serving sandwiches later in the day, so we ate some where else. We decided to return the next day on Sunday, and the same 3 post-its were on the menu board again! We were not happy! We got there earlier than we did on Saturday. This time they told us that they are out of a lot of the items that are needed to make sandwiches, & they are awaiting their shipment. But they said that they could only make us Tuna Sandwiches...So we went ahead & got that. This left us with a bad impression about this place & will most likely not return.  In the mean time, while we were in line....2 more customers walked in & noticed the post-its, too....They turned around & walked out.  Apparently, they are losing business by not having there 'shipment'.  ...The tuna sandwiches were quite dry, & not much flavor...  (....Hmmm, maybe they should just stick to coffee, cookies, & muffins.)

Only 2 Stars: Z-Pizza on Thomas: Haven't been here in a while because we have been going to the nearby FIRED PIE at Park Central instead, which is waaaay better!  But I received an e-mail for a free small pizza for my birthday, so we decided to return to z-pizza for that. I ordered the Thai Pizza & was disappointed....  The peanut sauce lacked any yummy flavor, quite bland, & it was missing one of the toppings that it was supposed to have....no carrots. I complained up at the counter, & to compensate, they gave me a free drink. That was nice of them, but they should have told me up front, & not assume that I wouldn't realize that one of the toppings was missing, because I used to get the Thai Pizza all the time & I remember lots of carrots on it!  There was hardly any red onions or bean sprouts on it either!  However, there was a fair amount of chicken on it.  I will not be returning to z-pizza again.  FIRED PIE, here we come!~  Also, the chairs make a LOT of noise there when they're moved around...annoying!

IN-N-OUT is the -KING- of fast food burger places! I am from SoCal is so is IN-N-OUT.  They are a HUGE hit there, but it's not as much, here in Phoenix I've noticed. Double-Double is a like a backyard burger..delicious! Crispy lettuce, lots of fully-melted cheese (not kinda melted like at most fast food places). Fresh fries from potatoes that they chop up right there in their store, thick shakes made with real ice cream! ....The prices are very reasonable because they stick to the basics: Burgers, Fries, Drinks & Shakes...That's it... No salads or chicken or fish sandwiches here! ....The Best over ALL others!

How can you not like COSTCO! ...We love Costco, we go 2-3 times a month! They have everything there, and you save so much money by buying in large sizes! We buy tons of eggs there, olive oil, canned tuna & salmon, sliced turkey, blueberries, oranges, apples, saline solution, books, etc, etc... You gotta think long-term when you shop at Costco. Gas is even cheaper there, too!  :)

We had a $25 Gift Certificate for Red Brick that we got off of the old Beth & Bill KEZ 99.9 FM website from their Half Off Deals Page. We also had a buy 1, get 1 free coupon from the Entertainment Book... They said that we could not use both. Either 1, or the other. We were furious!  A Gift Gertificate is just like cash. Period....It is not a Coupon, too. This made NO sense to us. Talk about a cheap Company! We ordered 2 pizzas... They both tasted bland, had like no flavor! Very disappointed. Z-Pizza is waaaay better by far!  We will never go to Red Brick again! I highly recommend Z-Pizza!  Also, there were like 4 Hispanics working behind the counter and they would all gabber in Mexican the whole time we were eating which we found to be rude, & not appropiate. Their prices seemed to be on the expensive side as well.  We used to go to the one on Camelback & 16th Street a long time ago, but that location closed. We only went to this location because we wanted to also go to some other stores in this area and use up the Gift Certificate we had.

This LA Fitness in the Town & Country on Highland & Camelback is ALWAYS hot! Seems like the AC doesn't work that well & everyone looks hot & miserable. This has been a problem for a long time now. It's always like 10 degrees hotter in the lower area vs, the very back area.  The music they play is AWFUL!  It's either annoying hip-hop crap, or some slow song...When you look around, just about everyone has an iPOD. The locker rooms are disgusting & very smelly, like dirty socks all the time!  The bathrooms are appaulling! The stalls are insanitary & dirty.  It's had to believe that this gym opened only 5 years ago in 2005.  We want to join the new GOLD's Gym in downtown Phoenix on Washington & Central.  ...Gold's rocks! ...LA Fitness sucks!

We've been going to Gold's Gym at Cityscape, downtown Phoenix since Feb 2011. We like it a lot vs. the gym we used to go to, LA Fitness at Camelback & Highland...yuck!!!  Gold's is so much better in everyway! The music is a bit on the hip-hop side which I don't like but I just wear my iPod for music. It is nice & cool in there, compared to LA Fitness...always so hot & muggy.  We work out in the evening so it's not too busy at all People seem to have a 'stigma' about downtown, but going to this Gold's actually made us appreciate downtown more than ever before.  :)

We work out late, usually from 8:30 pm to 10 pm....Almost everytime, they start mopping & vacuuming the gym during this time, & I'm getting really sick of it!  The ammonia of the mop always seems very strong & it bothers my contact lenses, plus it makes the gym very muggy. Can't they wait til closing to mop?? I hate when I'm doing a set & they're mopping or vacuuming all around me... I have to play "Dodge the Mop" game everytime I work out.  I like this gym, but not when they're doing this.  :(

This was our 1st time eating at BRICK.  We went late, got there at 9:40 pm. They close at 10 pm.  The waitress said we can only order pizzas, and -maybe' a salad because they are closing up the kitchen.  We looked at the menu & picked out a pizza & salad (they went ahead & made a salad, but it was the wrong one! We ate it anyway. The music there was very weird music, like LSD-trippy music. The waitress had a nose-ring in her nose, too! ..Gross.  People smoking outside in the front patio...the smoke was coming in to the restaurant! It was a bit irratating. We only went here because we had a Groupon coupon.  The pizza was overly greasy, but was tasty. The salad lacked dressing. They had 2 TV's in there, but like most places, it sports was showing..I am sooo sick of always seeing sports on the tv's at restaurants! ...Show a classic movie or something...Leave the sports to a Sports Bar!  ...Z-Pizza is better, but we are willing to give this place a 2nd chance though. :)

Okay, so I had mentioned in my 1st review of this place that we would give it a 2nd chance... We still giving them just 2 stars. We went on a Fri night...pretty busy. Decided to eat outside on their patio which was pretty full of people...They we short-staffed on this night. The waiter was nice but always in a hurry to run off & even ignored us a few times when we tried to get his attention. We both ordered red wine....The glass was only about 1/3 full & paid like $8 a glass! ...I can get a 1.5 liter of wine at thestore for this price. We got a greek salad & a margeurita pizza...Pretty good, but nothing extraordinary...Oregano's has them beat by far! We will most likely not come again to BRICK....Oregano's Rocks!

Sorry, but we don't see what all the hype is about! We've gone twice now & the burgers seem similar to Carl's Jr. Okay I admit, the fries ARE great & they give you a LOT, but I sill LOVE IN-N-OUT's Double-Double faaaar more!  Five Guys doesn't even have shakes! IN-N-OUT's shakes ROCK, as they use real ice cream & they're thick! ...They are also pricy, too!  ...A double cheese burger & a reg order of fries was over $9! We will most likely not return to Five Guys....IN-N-OUT...here we come!  :)

I don't see what all the hype is about this place. I like Subway way better. Jimmy John's doesn't have spinach or green bell pepper toppings like Subway does, for one reason.

So disappointed!  Gone twice now,  & still felt hungry. ..Their sandwiches are small. SUBWAY is better!

OMG! Amazing & scrumptious soft street tacos & delicious, fresh tamales!  ....5 Stars. all the way!   The food is modeled after Mexico City street eats. The most obvious choice is therefore the tacos, sold individually for $2.50 or in sets of three for $7. Soft corn tortillas encase a selection of fillings. The star here is the barbacoa, beef brisket rubbed with coffee and chili de arbol. It's a tender and flavorful way to fill a taco, but the chicken and pibil (pork shoulder) are good second choices. There's also an impressive vegetarian option that goes beyond the usual rice and beans to include roasted potatoes, mushrooms, and pepitas.

Ordered the Spinach & Goat Cheese Salad w/Chicken...The Chicken seemd very greesy! You have your choice of either grilled or crispy chicken...I chose grilled...Funny, I didn't see an option of 'Greesy Chicken" as one of the choices! (...Being scarcastic). I wanted no raisins in it, but they told me I would have get no nut-mix at all since raisins come in a mix with pumpkin seeds & dried cranberries, so I did that. I also ordered their Smash Fries, which were on the cold side...I should have returned them for a hot order, on top of that, they were very greesy as well, & just not to fresh to me. I probably should have gotten the Sweet Potato Fries which are better tasting, but I thought I'd try these.  Also, Their back door was open and it seemed like someone was smoking outside & the cigerette smoke was coming in to the restaurant! ...I was not happy about that. Also, someone was wearing a lot of cologne near by...Ugh!  I don't think I will want to eat here again... IN-N-OUT is much better & less expensive. ...Perhaps a Salad is NOT the thing to order here, I once had a Chicken Sandwich here & that was pretty good, maybe just stick to that in the future, IF I come back here again.  :)

It was 8:55 pm on a Sat night....the doors were still open so we walked in, the girl said they were closed. We said there's still 5 more minutes, but she said that her register showed it was 9:02 and that that they already closed & they can't ring up anymore sales....Apparently, the time on her register is fast because both of our cell phones showed 8:55 pm and they would technically still be open for business. At the same time, 2 more people walked in and she had to turn them away, too! ...I will be calling their store tomorrow to speak to a manager to complain.... They probably lost a good $20 easily in yogurt sales, just for closing 5 mins early, if you calculate that 4 people x 1 yogurt at an average of $5 each... I bet management would not be pleased to know that they lost about $20 in revenue because the register time is 7 mins fast!    Ended up just going to Safeway and bought a pint of yummy Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream...The Best, of course!

Sorry...Can only give this place 2 stars. We went at night, and the 1st thing we noticed was the cold, hard, white, & un-inviting  lights!!!! Ugh! ...Terrible lighting in there! It was like street light lighing, or like warehouse lighting....Was not appropriate for a dining place at all!   The waiter informed us that they were out of 3 things on the menu! (...That's a bad sign right there!). I ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side of Cole Slaw. The sauce & the shredded chicken came separate....You had to pour in the sauce on the chicken.  At Honey Bears, it already mixed in, which I feel is better that way. The chicken wasn't really that warm, luke warm at most, and that goes for the sauce, too. Plus, I thought the sauce was on the bland side. It was missing flavor.  The cole slaw was the same way...bland.  Honey Bear's is far better!! ...Their sauce is kick-ass! ...It has a 'kick'. Also, the sound acoustics were awful in there. There were only about  8 people dining but it sounded like there were 40 people!  Also, I spotted an employee eating food in the kitchen.... I don't think that customer should be seeing that happening. One more thing, the restroom smelled absolutely HORRIBLE! ...Like a sewer in there!  ...Sorry for all of the complaints, but I am just telling you what happened on my visit there... We will most likely not return here.  Honey Bear's BBQ is way better!

Everyday 2 weeks on a Monday we have "family dinner" where we usually pick a different restaurant to meet to catch up with family over dinner, so this week on Monday we decided to try Fuego at Cityscape to find out that they were closed. It was only 7 pm! We were unhappy about this, so we ended up going next door to The Strand. There was nothing on the door or window stating why they were closed on Monday, however there were holiday hours but nothing about being closed on Monday. Kind of bad timing to be closed especially since there is ice skating going on at cityscape which was absolutely jam packed with people and I am pretty sure that they worked up an appetite and would have loved some good Mexican food after ice skating, oh well, Fuego's loss I guess.

2/22/13, Fri...So we finally decided to try this place after we saw Cory McKlosky from FOX Morning News (...i know, i know...don't  ask...not a FOX News fan at all), but anyway, Not a good 1st impression right off the bat... There were 2 guys goofing around/teasing with the cashier girl, both being loud & kind of obnoxious for several minutes as we were waiting behind them to place our order. Finally, a 2nd cashier girl came to get or order.  I had ordered the Sourdough Grilled BBQ  Chicken Sandwich.... They made it with a Wheat bun instead! I got the manager, Maggy, she was super sweet & quite apologetic. And my partner ordered a double char burger, but it was the bun that was charred & dried out, & hard. I decided to just go ahead & eat mine, but my partner had re-ordered his.  We also got sweet potato fries...nothing special... kinda disappointed...Nothing like the Cinnamon-Dusted Sweet Pototao Fries at FEZ on Central! Damn, those are good, anyway,...I also ordered a strawberry shake...Again, I was kind of disappointed... It was like ice milk, not creamy at all like they are at IN-N-OUT BURGER, which is the KING of burger places... Doulble-Double kicks @$$ by far, which are HUGE, back in So Cal where I'm from. Anyway, wasn't too fond of the strawberry flavor...so, I got it exchanged for chocolate which was a littlle better...So to make this long story short, (too late, lol), we will probably not be returning here.  Seems like they're trying to be like SMASH Burger.

This yogurt place next door to HULA's on Central The flavors were all good, & the yogurt was that high-quality creamy kind, not that lower-quality ice milk garbage. They offered many different toppings! We are definately coming back & I HIGHLY recommend this place! No complaints here!  :)

This venue is awesome! Nice big dance floor, kick- ass sound system, & a newly installed light & laser system, & a decent sized patio area. A friend of ours is a promoter that has attempted to put on modern, state of the art monthly dance parties at this venue, but it's like pulling teeth trying to get people to go, as people continue to go to lame Charlies instead, that's Phoenix for you..... Get with it already, Phoenix!

This is my third time here the first two times the girl there was really friendly and nice and helpful, but the third time is not a charm. There was some puffed up guy that was not friendly, and my tanning booth in bed number 1, 3 bulbs were burned out, and the eye cover thing was missing the plastic cover on one side, I told him all  that when I got out and he didnt even say sorry. He could at least have said sorry! The first 3 tans were free with a coupon, I had to pay $15 for one tan this time.

Have gone a few more times now.  I am so hooked on the Pesto Chicken Pizza! I always add on add'l toppings which is surprisingly NO extra cost! Most pizza places would charge you for each add'l topping...NOT here! So I usually add on artichoke hearts, feta cheese, roasted peppers, spinach & garlic!  How can you beat that! I usually go after the big lunch rush, usually like 4 pm, otherwise expect to wait in line at the peak of the lunch rush during the week, but the line does go pretty fast. I like that they are even open til 8 pm, M-F, and even til 4 pm Sat & Sun!.... In a way, it's kind of their advantage to stay open later like that, as people get off work in the nearby area & they can swing in their to get a pizza or salad!  On the counter, they have parm cheese, & red pepper flakes to sprinkle on your pizza, but they also have garlic powder, & Italian Seasonings, too!    Before this place opened, I would usually go to the nearby Z-Pizza on Thomas, but no more!

LOVE this concept of a create-your-own pizza place, similar to like Subway, where you go down the row & tell them what you want on your pizza!  I really like that there is NO add'l cost for add'l toppings!!!  ....I've also been to FIRED PIE Pizza at Park Central Mall, which is the same concept, & if I were to compare the 2 places, I would pick FIRED PIE over Pizza Studio.... I felt that the toppings were skimpy at Pizza Studio vs. FIRED PIE, which seemed more hearty. Also, FIRED PIE has a better Pesto Sauce vs. Pizza Studio.  - MC

We went to the new relocated FEZ last night for the first time. The second you walk in the door, you are hit with loud obnoxious conversation, and it stays that way throughout your whole meal. The food is still good, however the acoustics in this new place are just horrible! I have tinnitus, and this definitely did not help it whatsoever. I don't think we will be returning any time soon. Also, the waitress short-changed me a $1 on my cash back.  Also, I ordered red wine, and she brought me white wine instead.
