If I could give 0 stars I would. Worst flowers I've ever seen! We ordered these for our CORPORATE manager! We paid around $80.. we could've gone to Fry's and paid $5.99 for better flowers than these! Customer service is useless as well. Thanks a lot FTD!

Always a long line in the drive-thru. Every time I've gone through, we've waited 20-30min. Last night around 9:30 pm we waited 30min.. there was only one car in front of us. I got so annoyed I just drove straight through and left the drinks. Worst location ever! Always understaffed and my drink gets made different every time. I'm going to corporate.

Just moved to the area and was looking for a new nails place this weekend. It was a holiday weekend and they were packeddd. We maybe waited 10 minutes and they were able to fit the 2 of us in for a fill and pedis and we were in and out with 2 hours. Lam did my fill and design and he was AMAZING! Lam is the owner and is usually booked by appointments but he fit us right in! He was very informative and made a great first impression! Thanks Lam and the team! We will be back every month for sure!!

Another great experience! Made an appointment a week in advance with Lam for a full set. He was right on time and just as good as the first visit. Lam and his team are my new favorite!

This place is seriously awful.. if you like your car getting hit, roaches in the apartment, weed smokers everywhere, never getting to use the pool, and never being able to park in your spot.. move here. I suggest reading the Google reviews.. They're not good. Only thing we liked was the complimentary breakfast in the mornings. Here are the pictures after cleaning and moving out.. cleaner than how we moved into it and we still got charged over $200!!

I work down the street for Uhaul and was looking for a good burrito place near by. 1st time here and it was amazingggg. I ordered a burrito smothered with the pork chille sauce and got a fountain dribk, chips and salsa. $16 but it was a ton of food! Only ate half. Yummy!!! I'll definitely be back!

The wait was horrible!!! I live right around the corner so I went to this new location. So disappointed! Went through the drive through cuz that's usually pretty quick...WRONG! There was 2 cars in front of me and it took a total of 35 minutes! I could've gone to the Mesa location and gotten back within that amount of time. So sad because I love this place but gosh, the wait sucked!

1st timer! My mom and I live close by so we decided to check it out. Lisa did my acrylic gel nails and they look perfect! Great quality for a great price. Lisa is super friendly and the shop is cute and clean. Looking forward to next time! Thanks Lisa!
