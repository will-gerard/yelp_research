This is your old school Italian restaurant.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Tony Soprano there.  The food has always been excellent and appears to be all done in-house.  The waiter even commented that the sausage was made in-house so the spices could vary depending on the chef.  I usually get the mussels which are served swimming in a big wide bowl with butter to dip.  And they are not too shabby considering we are in the middle of the desert.  How I miss good seafood.  My next favorite is the eggplant parm.  Very yummy.  This is one of my favorite restaurants.

Went with two friends for appetizers after a movie.  Service was great.  Food was eh.  The Alice Springs chicken quesadilla was good but something I felt you could get anywhere.  Besides chicken and cheese, it had mushrooms and bacon with a honey mustard dipping sauce.  The Kookaburra wings not so good.  Dry.  The Blueberry martini was tasty but lacking in alcohol and I'm a lightweight these days when it comes to alcohol.

Pizza NY style which can be hard to find here in the desert. Order at the counter and they'll call your name or if a full pie they'll bring it to your table. Drinks you fill yourself but you can refill as many times as you want. Slices are large which you can just fold to eat like a good New Yorker. Garlic, oregano, red pepper, and grated cheese are on the tables ready for you to top your slices.

A fun restaurant! Staff is friendly and service is good. I usually come for the nigiri and the Orange slice. Recently tried their yakisoba which was yummy and their fried rice which was okay. Being near the university, the crowd can be on the younger side but I've never felt out of place.

I had the Mexican hot dog.  The dog was boiled not grilled.  The bacon was bacon bits sprinkled on top.  The "bun" was cold as were most of the toppings which quickly cooled down my dog to lukewarm.  My friend had the chicken stuffed burrito and she said it seemed like the chicken was boiled also.  My other friend did enjoy the tortilla soup and beef taco.  And everything but the soup was served on styrofoam.  I am so Not a fan of styrofoam.

Having been to a lot of courthouses back East as part of my job, this was the first courthouse I had been to since moving to Arizona. The courthouse itself is a more modern building. The jury pool waiting room (which I didn't get to spend much time in as I was quickly called for jury selection) was large with lots of seating and tv monitors. Half the room had sports and the other half had hgtv. There was also a break room and a room to use your laptop or whatever. There is free WiFi. There is also a cafeteria and a little shop on site. Though you have to go through security again if you go to them. If you are summoned for jury duty, there is free a parking garage a few blocks away with a shuttle running every 15 minutes. The garage is located at 8th avenue and Jefferson. The guards do confirm that you are part of a jury or jury selection. Overall, it was a pleasant experience.

I have been here twice recently and I wish I had found them sooner! Family owned. The first time was for an oil change. Friendly, no pressure. Last time was a couple of days ago. Planning a cross country drive and wanted to make sure there was nothing looming. They took a look see and checked all the bits and she (my car) passed with a clean bill of health. So yay for that. They didn't charge me since nothing had to be done. This place is awesome and super friendly. And as a female I feel totally comfortable going here.

Ruby and Stella got their beautiful new summer hairdos. They did the cut exactly the way I asked and I couldn't be happier with the results.
