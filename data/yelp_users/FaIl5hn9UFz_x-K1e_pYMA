Like so many other restaurants in the downtown Phoenix area, Sacks is overpriced for what it is and if you are expecting the quality of "Sachs," the department store, you will be disappointed.   The "sandwicherie" title means they are serving sandwiches and not subs. Kind of like what you'd make at home on bread.   I'm not sure it's done  any better here than at Subway or Blimpie. To me, the deli at the Safeway up the road has more exotic sandwich toppings than Sacks (including two different kinds of guacamole).  Like so many places in AZ, every sandwich offered has some kind of cheese on it. It's like it gives the restaurant a reason to throw another buck or two onto the price.   Additionally, Sacks has numerous flies in the summertime. Covering your food is a requirement before going to the restroom, though most of them hang out on the windows.   I've been to Sacks during the busy lunch rush and I've been there when there were more flies than patrons.   The one bright spot is their homemade desert cookies and bars. For some reason they are served cold, which takes some of the freshness away. Exotic flavors of iced tea like mango and pineapple green are a plus too, but by all means not the best unsweetened teas around.

I actually left a review for these guys years ago and removed it but I see others have experienced similar problems.  Loved the used car I purchased but I was lied to about free car washes, threatened by one of the managers after I had agreed to buy the car and finished up the paperwork and had numerous stall tactics pulled on me while I was there.  I got like two car washes after purchasing the vehicle and then after my salesperson left  I was told no more car washes. Wasn't part of their original offer.  I'm told FC is owned by Chapman. It's no wonder Chapman doesn't put its name on this dealership. Go elsewhere to buy your Chevy or used vehicle.   I have a tainted view of Chapman now because of my very poor experience with Freeway Chevy in Chandler.

Teaks prides itself on not being the "pub grub" kind of place. Well, that and serving a beer called Moose Drool, which I hear has real moose saliva!  Anyway, you gotta love a place where there's peanuts in the shell on every table and you can order breakfast any time of day...or night.  How many sports bars serve breakfast anyway?  Despite the numerous plasma/LCD televisions, sometimes Teaks gives off more of a family restaurant vibe than that of a sports bar.  There are a lot of little kids in there on days and nights and it seems to be a popular post-game venue for parents following Corona del Sol home games.   Food is good, portions are large and the variety is awesome. That alone will bring in people of any age.   One thing I cannot understand is why, with so many great televisions, the place would rather play the stereo than put the volume on when there are games on.  During an NFL game recently it took them about a quarter to get the volume restored on the second half of the Giants/Eagles game (rather than switching to the local feed) and on one busy college football Saturday a spaghetti western popped on one screen.  Still, I can live with Sergio Leone, football and eggs.

I had an opposite experience of the initial reviewer. In 2012 I was taken in here and my concerns were addressed. I've been to much nicer Dr's offices with flat screen TVs and leather couches but that's not nearly what we're looking for when we go to a Dr.   Her office is in an old 1970's style building with 1970's style furnishings. I never spend too much time in the waiting room though and she spends a significant amount of time listening to and addressing my concerns, even when one was an orthopedic concern.   As the previous reviewer stated, Rheums aren't easy to come by in the Valley and Dr. Pace is the only one in Tempe. I get reminder calls before the day of my appointment, my pharmacist can handle dealing with the Dr's office for refills so that I don't have to call and waiting time in the sitting room is minimal.  Unfortunately she is not on my new insurance plan so I either have to pay cash or find a different Dr.

Sebastian the comic does a funny skit on Ross Stores where he talks about finding "a shoe" instead of a pair and how the place looks like"downtown Beirut."  He exaggerates, but you get the point. Items are thrown all over the place at Ross and at a faster rate than the employees could clean them.  The AZ Mills Ross is no exception.  There are some great deals to be found at Ross Stores, but you really need patience.  My problem with the AZ Mills Ross is that the parking lot side registers rarely open, no matter how long the line is up front. Customers also can't do returns on the back registers.  Also, this Ross just seems to be more cramped than others. Possibly because it's a mall store or maybe it's just situated poorly.   The shoe row intrudes into the clothing and it ends at a busy corner making it difficult to get by.  It used to be in the back corner near linins where it worked better.   Outstanding deals can be found on shoes, clothes, luggage, DVDs and name brand linens.   Prices for accessories like hats, socks and underwear are also good.  I preferred the Mesa store (Alma School/Southern) but it recently closed. There's a store in Tempe Marketplace and a new one coming right up the road on Southern and McClintock.   This one is just too cramped, lines too long and sometimes racks are too packed with clothes that they're difficult to sort through.

XB does a lot of things that other coffee houses didn't think to do or won't do. That's why it brings such a wide, yet consistent, customer base from college kids to the elderly.  For one, free WiFi is awesome, even if theirs is slower than many dial-ups. Getting a good signal inside the vault is tough too.   Two, the whole live music thing really works there. Mondays is ragtime night, Thursdays is usually acoustic and Fridays is a hodgepodge.   Years ago they had small bands that set up in front of the piano, but all music booked there is strategically done so that it is not intrusive to people trying to work.  Ownership is aware that lots of college kids use that place as their library and many business people also get on their laptops at XB so the next local coming of Judas Priest isn't going to be setting up shop there anytime soon.   The piano is also free game to any patron wanting to show off his/her stuff. I've yet to hear anyone embarrass there; The audience is too big and too busy to take that risk.   Three, XB offers a wide assortment of teas. I am not a coffee drinker but I know a good tea when I taste one. Of XB's 500 or so tea flavors, I've found two that I like and about 5 that taste like Valvoline that half a pint of honey can't make more flavorful.   Just the fact that they offer honey in a squeeze bottle over individual packets is a huge plus. Unsweetened iced teas (I've had 2/3) are also pretty good.   I'm at XB quite often during closing time (it used to be open all night) and sometimes the girl will start cleaning the tables and say to me directly, "It's 11 o'clock, we're closed." It's as if she's telling me to go but the 13 other people chatting or working on laptops get to stay until 11:30.   Now what they do is turn the Internet server off at 10:35 to get people to leave quicker. I think that's a little Bush League.  Still, it's a good environment with a vibe I think other coffee houses yearn for. I mean if you're going to spend nearly $5 on a latte shouldn't there be some kind of intangible involved that justifies it?  XB makes it somewhat justifiable.

For those of you that have never been, SM is more like a Sprouts for the hippy crowd with better prices.  The store is spread out nicely and there's a strong emphasis on fresh produce. Pre-packaged and frozen meals are at a minimum as compared to Trader Joe's and Fresh & Easy.   Two things that stand out are one, you can pump your own honey out of a metal bin and the price per pound is far cheaper than honey in a container anywhere else. Be sure not to open the lid and peek inside, bees buzz around in there. It's fresh stuff.  Two, there are "bulk foods" canisters which are dead center in the middle of the store. Good for making your own trail mix because the pre-packaged one you usually buy didn't have, say,  yogurt covered raisins or dried orange cranberries. And if Quaker Oats don't suit your style you can bag  your own here.  Finding pens to mark your garbage ties is nearly impossible. Bring your own to make the process easier, for you and the register person.   Check out the back corner for good sale prices on meats and fish too.

Excellent service but pricey on tires.  Good, clean waiting room with an abundance of magazines and bottled water if you need it.  DT actually will fix most tire punctures for free just hoping you give them your business next time you need tires.  I tried doing that but I found that their prices are not only high, but they seem to persuade you into a tire they have in stock rather than one you may have thoroughly researched on the Net that you felt was in your price range, got good reviews and was right for your driving needs.  I actually traded in my vehicle hours after going to DT and getting a $800+ price quote on tires. The difference I paid for the one-year newer vehicle was close to what the tires and the needed alignment would have cost.  Nothing I would recommend or that I would would typically do, but $800+ is like a major engine repair.   DT has helped me through some jams in the past and I plan on returning. Service is good and they work quickly and efficiently.  There are better deals on tires elsewhere though, even online.

Truly the most inefficient restaurant that I eat at, or have eaten at, Venezias is a place with good food but little idea how to properly serve it.   As a native northeasterner I've been to many pizzerias but I've never been to a place that takes your order and takes your name when all you want is a slice of pizza and it's situated two feet to the left of the register.   Please, just take my money and then scoop me a slice onto a plate and hand it to me or scoop it into the oven and then wait on the next person.  Venezias makes things far more complicated than it has to and I've had my order screwed up numerous times there.   The restaurant has something called a Party Pizza. It's the restaurant's largest size pie. It's the slices from that size pie that go on sale as individual slices. If you order a pizza pie to go that isn't a party pizza (say a large or XL) you get a different size pizza that I believe actually tastes different.   The slices are actually excellent. It truly is NY style Neopolitan pizza and the chicken wings are good too. Service is nothing what you'd expect in a pizzeria though.  It's NY style pizza but not NY style service. Everything is done slowly and overly methodically. The Tempe location is a crowded, narrow, suck-in- your-gut to pass by someone kind of place. That's not unlike other pizzerias, but in other places you only have to wait around for your order if you have something that needs to be cooked.   Venezias makes you wait in some kind of pecking order to get your slice when a server behind the counter reads your name off of the register receipt. That's just bizarre. For a small cramped place that gets crowded during lunch they waste so much time asking every customer their name and then typing it into the register so it prints on the receipt.   Also, this is a pizzeria, not a fine italian restaurant. There is not a need for luxo-looking pleather booths and chairs to go along with fancy new tables. The old rickety ones were just fine.   This is a grab a meal and go place, not a break out the candles and wine kinda joint. The metal tables and chairs you have outside are just fine. The new accommodations take up valuable space in an otherwise cramped dining area.  Good pizza, good wings, strange service and prices that have risen steadily over the past few years. It it were more efficient I'd give it another star, I'd even go there to eat more often than I do.  Addendum: As of the Fall 09 this place has expanded and is actually too big. It's quite comfortable though and patrons seem to spend a longer amount of time there than before. There are a few flat screens on the wall too. Their method is still strange  and they call slice orders out over a microphone. Sit in the back dining room and you might not hear your name. Service even got a bit friendlier. I added an additional star (going from 3 to 4) for the renovations and friendlier service.

Ted's cooks dogs the way many of us do in our yards, grilled and charred. Try finding dogs like that anywhere else.  Yeah, the dogs are pricey but they are cooked in front of you and there's a choice of beef dogs or pork. Onion rings and fries are side options.  For an old building it's kept very clean. You don't seem to find yourself cleaning up someone else's mess just so you can sit down. Of course I avoid the place during weekday lunch crowds where the line gets pretty long.   I like the "What can I get you?" New York deli ordering style that they employ to get the line moving quicker. Once one customer's order is thrown on the grill they're asking the next person in line what they want whether that person is standing up at the counter or not.  It''s efficient and keeps the line moving.

I'm really surprised this place has been ripped so thoroughly in reviews. I've been here numerous times and I've been taken care of well.  At first I'd go for the severe cold and flu stuff, once being bronchitis.  Years later I had more serious problems.   The person who said you really never see a real MD is right. I'm not sure I ever saw a Dr. in all my times here, but that's not a real issue with me. Diagnose my illness and give me something to cure it. If the custodian there could do that I'd be happy.   I once went here not knowing what was wrong with me and a PA diagnosed it and gave me a ton of literature on the illness. I didn't fill the prescription she gave me and I cured the ailment with over-the-counter supplements she recommended.   One reason I go here is because it's rarely crowded and I'm usually not in the waiting room long.   I was recently told that I need to start going to a Primary Care doctor and develop a relationship there in case I need a referral somewhere. Urgent Care can't give referrals based on your insurance.  Maybe I'm just fortunate that I've had better experiences than others on here.

I've always found the location of John Henry's to be rather peculiar. It's at the front of the parking lot of a strip mall that features a sports bar and a women's workout place among other things.   I got the feeling that it would rather be closer to Ray or Warner than Guadalupe or Elliot. Still, it's in a location where it's very conspicuous. So conspicuous that I wish I never noticed it.  The food is egregiously overpriced. The food borders on average to below average. My first inclination that my entree might not be so good was when I ate my salad and it was prepared with ordinary iceberg lettuce and not much else other than a fairly tasty dressing.   A few bites in and I knew it would be my last time at this place. I cannot figure out where Henry's gets off charging the prices that it does and is still able to keep its doors open. Even more perplexing is the clientele.  It was teenagers taking their dates out for a fancy dinner (or so they thought) or groups of elderly people.   It got me thinking there was an early bird special that I was missing out on?  The clientele of JH doesn't bother me like it did some in other reviews, but the food and the prices and lack of quality did. A respectable menu without respectable food for a triple digit bill for two people is unacceptable.

Giligin's is somewhat of a deceptive-looking establishment located in a part of Scottsdale that so many bars or restaurants would kill to be.  The place is done up with an abundance of island/nautical themes and leads one to believe it's some kind of clam and oyster bar. It's also tried posing as a sports bar.   Truth is Giligin's does serve seafood but I wouldn't recommend getting it. Even standard pub grub like wings, motz sticks and other fried apps were mediocre.   Giligin's tried to tap in on the college football crowds some years back and they adopted us to have our game watch parties there.  Their tvs were of poor quality, like circa 1990s and many times they left up the sex games that bar patrons played the night before.  They had some kind of spin the wheel game with a lubricant in one slot and condoms in another. Sounds like fun stuff but on Saturday morning when people come in to watch their alma-maters play and bring their family, it's out of place and tacky.   One Saturday morning they locked the doors and didn't let patrons in (yes there were people inside). No announcement, no note on door, nothing.   I have stopped there at night before but I remember it being uneventful and leaving. It was basically just a stop in while heading from one place to another.  It seems like it's the kind of place that lives on walker-by traffic. Why else would one go?

I've been to five different Oreganos in the Valley and each one is pretty consistent as far as food is concerned. All of them get very packed, there's a 30+ minute wait to get seated on weekends and a 30+ minute wait if you want a pan pizza. At least servers tell you that up front.  Servers are pretty friendly too. So much so that multiple friends think they have a shot at dating them by the time we're done eating.   We've chosen to sit at the bar at the Tempe location to avoid long waits in getting a table. Problem is, and I don't know if they do this at all the locations, they'll charge you for certain soft drinks (mainly soda water) at the bar but never when you're at a table.   I've never questioned it but I don't understand it.   Parking is pretty decent here and there's an abundance of chairs in the parking lot and reading material for people who are waiting to get  a seat. There's a large outdoor seating section too, but I don't know if they bring the heaters out there during winter nights like they do in Mesa.  Even weekend afternoons here could warrant a wait. I'd avoid it during ASU basketball games or football Saturdays.

One of the most ironic things about this place is that it's a stone's throw away from Pita Jungle, yet they're completely different restaurants.  At Haji-Baba the exquisite architecture and the scantily-clad waitresses, don't get factored into your bill. Basically because there aren't any.  It's basically a dive attached to a market.  I love the decor at Pita Jungle but I can't make that justify the food prices.  You can order a appetizer at Haji's that can serve as your meal or just a simple gyro which comes served in tin foil.  The iced tea is great and the baklava comes in more flavors than Baskin Robbins has ice cream.  This place is also a fave of many college students.  One thing I can't understand about Haji's is the service. It's kinda like they don't care. Clearing tables is more important to them than taking care of patrons already at a table. Many times I've gotten up and refilled my own drink.   Prices are low, food is good but check the hours before you go. It doesn't keep standard restaurant hours and I think it takes Sundays off. Odd.

A family run business that even brings its dogs to work sometimes.  They even take off a week or two in the summer for vacation and close the doors, showing money isn't everything to them and if they can't be there to run it themselves, they'd rather close the shop temporarily.   I got an incredible price on a timing belt and water pump some years back. PA is also open on Saturdays and can do alignments (which many mechanics sub out).  Bizarre location and parking is a bit cumbersome. You could probably make the long walk to Wal-Mart or hop a bus through Guadalupe to  Mills Mall if your vehicle's going to be a while.   Walking distance from Phase 54 too. I guess that does you no good though unless this place is open late at night.

Good Chinese food is so hard to find in this part of the country that I'm surprised this place only gets 3.5 stars from reviewers. I'm not going to recommend any one dish but Wong's is the closest thing I've experienced to Chinese food in the Northeast (think Seinfeld minus the deliveries). Prices are reasonable and there are even two different menus, one being an authentic Chinese one. I had a server who completely didn't understand me, which is why I left off a fifth star. He wasn't Chinese either. There is no decor in this place whatsoever so you know the main focus is the food. It even feels like a NY sit down Chinese restaurant. From what I'm told it's been around a while too, well worth checking out.

Years ago this was the typical ghetto teen hip hop dance club with no dress code and even less class.   Since the well publicized shooting the place seemed to have changed its image and some of its rules. Gone are the guys in football and basketball jerseys down to their knees and the skanks that love them. I don't believe it's as crowded as it used to be.   The place is simply too large to be a dance club. It's set up more like a live music venue and even has some side areas closed off. Upstairs is for 21+ and downstairs is for all others.   Buzz should have the ability to attract bands and get crowds like that of the Marquee Theatre. It's that large and has that much floorspace.   As a nightclub though, it's too difficult to fill, particularly with the new image it's portraying.

I been to five different Oregano's in the Valley and although I've had bizarre experiences at three of them, some of it was due to the company I was with and not the actual restaurant itself.  As a native northeasterner who appreciates traditional NY style Neopolitan pizza, I'm not a big thick crust/pan pizza guy. Oregano's pan pizza is different though.  Their smallest pie can fill up two people and unlike Pizza Hut (not that I actually eat there), the crust is never greasy and with topping choices like cajun chicken or sundried tomatoes, who can complain?   Their house salad is great with lettuce options more exotic than your standard iceberg and excellent dressings. Chicken wings are also very good with a mustard flavor that tastes a lot better than it sounds.   Most customers hate surprises. At Oregano's they avoid surprises by telling you the wait time for a table or that pan pizzas take 35-40 minutes to cook.  I was at the Mesa restaurant on a weekday and our pizza was taking forever. We began dozing off at the table when our server came to us and told us the cooks forgot about us and there will be no charge for the whole meal (including salad we ate earlier) and did we still want to eat the pizza here or take it to go?  It was after 11 pm on a Wed. Following that a manager came to us and told us how he felt when a restaurant when he's in a restaurant and things go wrong and how he reacts to the staff (keep in mind we never complained or even asked about when our pizza was coming). He gives his apologies and tells us a desert cookie will be made for us while our pizza is being finished. That was also going to be free.   After eating our pizza and sharing the only desert they serve (a large homemade cookie served in the pan it was cooked in with lumps of ice cream on top) we tried to leave a tip on our zero balance bill that the waitress didn't even seem interested in accepting.   Despite the wait, it was a pleasant experience that someone could realize something was wrong and do something about it without you having to tell them.   I've also eaten at the North Scotts location, Old Town, Camelback and University in Tempe. All are pretty standard in quality.  If I have some criticism it is that I like my pizza toppings on top of my pizza. At Oreganos they go under the cheese, which makes it hard to get crispy.   This sometimes prevents me from ordering meats like pepperoni or ground beef. That's okay though, because I like the vegetable options too.   Also, I've waited nearly an hour on multiple occasions at the Mesa location to get a pan pizza. Other locations are usually closer to their 35 minute estimation.

Remember the good old days when you could go Stinkweeds in Tempe next to Pita Jungle and see a band perform live, just hours before it was to take the stage at Marquee Theatre?  Seeing Camper Van Beethoven play live at a local record store is what stands out to me. Then patrons even have the opportunity to chat with the band as they pack their gear. That's simply unheard of.   Even Kimber, the owner, told me of the days when the store had a location in Mesa and sold a bunch of vinyl.   Now, thanks to the ipod generation and illegal downloading of music,  all we're left with is the Phoenix store. The Camelback store has a great collection of obscure music you won't find in other stores. The store also has band stickers you'd be hard pressed to find on the Internet.   I believe Stinkweeds is what Hoodlums aims for but Hoodlums gets local bands to perform there and their selection is far more mainstream.   Worth the drive to central Phoenix to find, say, that German synth pop EBM band that Best Buy will never carry.

The fact that this dumpy looking converted house on Camelback has 25+ reviews really says something about this place. Even if most people cannot pronounce the name properly (I took French in high school).  Even after closing the upstairs they were able to make this a happening little club.   Retro and Beyond was good, albeit held once a month.  Wednesday nights had the same regulars but the most amazing thing to me on Wednesdays was that there was one person on staff for the whole night.  There was no bouncer, there was just the short little girl bartender.  When skirt boy spilled his beer on the dancefloor (a common occurrence for him) she'd have to come out from the bar and mop.  I kept waiting for a fight or skirmish to break out and see her turn into bouncer too.  In reality Wednesdays worked really well because people were there for the music and for the people. There was no posturing or imaging or testosterone displays.   I can't speak for French Kiss or the gay and lesbian events this place had, but Wednesdays and Retro and Beyond Saturdays worked well.  Probably the most unique Halloween party I've been to as well.  They decorated the place and changed the entrance from the front to the rear. It was so once I got inside I didn't recognize where I was or how to get to the dancefloor.   Sorry to see the club go.

This Barros used to be on the corner of Hardy and Baseline just up the road in a less attractive shopping center. It's now in a more luxurious place but food and service seem to be as good as it was.   Barros uses real chicken breast, doesn't skimp on toppings and offers a good variety of specialty pies.  Bbq chicken pizza, hot wing pizza and a southwest style pizza are among its offerings. It also serves beer (at least in in its last location).   Barros is a place better served to eat in than take out. The place doesn't have many tvs, but there always seem to be a game on during weekends and salad bar prices are fair.   Food usually comes out fairly quickly and it's consistent from one time to the next. It never seems to be too crowded either because so many people order their pies to go.   Just a good place to relax and eat Chicago-style pizza with fresh ingredients and watch a game.

Four and a half stars would probably be more suitable for my review since it's only the third best place to shop for value in its own parking lot, but since its return policy was so liberal and there's an abundance of hard-to-find brand names, I give it 5.   I think other reviewers are confused as to what kind of store this really is. This is not an outlet store and this is not a store where something you liked on Tuesday they'll have more of on Friday.   This is a store that sells new (unlike Last Chance in Phoenix) merchandise that is of a previous year or has expired its shelf life in Nordstrom department stores.   Because you cannot find your size or color in something you like or because you liked something last week and now you can't find anything is not the fault of the store. This is not a mall store.  This is a right-place-right-time store. Find your item in the right size and acceptable color and grab it at a discounted price.  Sometimes I do more browsing at Norstrom than actual buying. It's that kind of place. Walk to TJ Maxx and Ross so it's not a wasted trip.  The clientele of people that shop at The Rack are also of a higher class. This place could easily look like a Ross Store with all the shoe racks, but it doesn't. Aisles are clean and uncluttered and shoes and clothes seem to stay in their proper places.  Employees are consistently walking around restocking things or fielding questions and The Rack puts an appropriate number of people at the registers so that lines move quicker.  A few years back NR was very liberal about items it took back. Translation: It took back used items as well as items that didn't even come from Nordstrom. I've heard this from multiple sources, including an employee.   Imagine pulling a shirt out of your closet you got from Target and taking it back to a different store for a credit.  NR took these items and shipped them to Last Chance, a store on Camelback/Highland that sells new and used merchandise with no chance of returning or exchanging--hence the name.   The Rack is not as liberal on returns as it was but it's still a great place to shop. High end brand names in shoes and clothing, a clean store that's easy to move around in, register lines that move and very attractive female customers.

When all the employees are wearing bright orange shirts it's never difficult to spot someone who works there.   There's always plenty of employees on site and prices are fair and sales are even better. I've gotten many, many shirts-both t-shirts and otherwise-for $6.   Sales differ throughout the season but I've found great deals Thanksgiving time and after. Better selection on clothing than the Anthem store too.

There are so many things wrong with this gym that I could probably write a small book on its gross lack of customer service and inattentiveness to detail, but I'll try to sum it up in under 20 paragraphs.  PF puts far more emphasis on the customer it's trying to court than the one it already has. Basically, a sell-sell-sell attitude. Once you are a member, you're nothing to them anymore.  -I've tried to get the tv put on to no avail sometimes. PF has numerous tvs and often a big game will be showing where people are doing cardio but where people (moslty men) are lifting free weights, we'll get news or golf. "I don't know how to work the tv" or "I'll ask someone to do it" are popular responses. I've even been turned down trying to get an ASU game on and that's the local team. Disappointing for a gym with satellite tv.  - PF has lowered rates for new customers and done nothing for their existing ones. They've even given equipment away to one of their other gyms meaning you're getting less for your money.   - Trainers hold special aerobics classes inside the gym. No, not inside the aerobics room, inside the gym where people work out. It's not unusual to see people doing wind sprints up and down the hallway or a group of people doing ab work in front of a machine you'd like to use.   -For years this place didn't provide paper towels. If you wanted to clean down equipment or your brow, you had to buy a towel or bring your own. The bathroom only had heated dryers or toilet paper.  It now has paper towel dispensers but some are often empty and workers rarely care. Patrons here do a great job cleaning up after themselves.   - Pushing supplements is more important than pushing you to work harder. This location has a very hard time keeping female trainers. Women are constantly being hired, but they don't last long. I'm told being  a trainer there is very difficult because you are not just required to recruit a stable of people to train, you have to sell them supplements as well. PF sells its own brand of supps  and trainers will tell you how wonderful they are, better prices than stores, etc. I think the trainers are competent, I'm told they're required to sell stuff though and convincing one that Apex is better than name brands and much cheaper is not what we want to hear during our training.   - Loose or damaged equipment is often left unattended. From week to week some of the same dumb bells are loose and I once reported a bent bar on the bench press and no one there cared to remove it. I told multiple employees too.  - Aerobics classes are subpar and so are the times. Some of the classes are titled one thing and then when you get into the class they're doing something else. I once did a kickboxing class and the girl had us doing wind sprints and some kind of standing aerobic movements that didn't involve punching or kicking. Many of their better classes start at like 5 p.m. It's almost as if their schedule is geared around students.   There's a high turnover rate at this gym too. From the front desk girls to the trainers (many of the male trainers have been there a while) to the managers. There's literally a different manager there every few weeks and the guy who introduces himself to you on a Wednesday and says 'If you have any problems my name's Bob," will be named Steve a few weeks later and Mark after that.  Competitive pricing compared to other gyms, convenience and decent, clean equipment keep me going there.  Unless this gym is really convenient for you or the price is well below what other gyms are charging, check into your other options.

I'm approximately 20 miles from The Farm Grill but I've eaten there more than a dozen times. While I think it has the best burger (albeit thin) in the Valley, it's not without its faults.  When I explain The Farm Grill to people I tell them it's food on a farm in a high tech, modern environment. I mean where else can you eat at a farm restaurant that has a condiment flushing system, TVs in the restrooms (that shows the same movie every time) and broadcasts 90s indie music on the speakers?  Remember the scene in Pulp fiction where Uma Thurman orders a milk shake and Travolta asks for a sip because he wants to know what a $5 milk shake tastes like? Well these shakes, particularly the chocolate malt, is worthy of the $4.30 price tag. I've never tried the ribs  but my friends enjoyed the salmon and tuna sandwiches.  The biggest problem with the Farm Grill is flies. I stop eating there in the late spring / early summer each year because the flies are unbearable, even indoors.   Depending on the time of day the lines get very big and the place doesn't open multiple registers. Food usually comes out quickly though no matter how crowded it is.  Due to the fact that this place is in east Gilbert the clientele is very white and very mormon. There are more pregnant women and young children at The Farm Grill on a weekend afternoon than there are in some maternity wards.   If you can stand eating among large families and battling traffic to refill your own drinks and condiment cups, the Farm Grill is a good choice for the meat loving crowd. Just avoid it during the warm weather season because no one should spend $12 on a meal and feel the need to devour it as quick as possible just to avoid a fly infestation.  They are now open for breakfast too.

Mention The Burrito Co. to anyone who is from or lives in Ahwatukee and they know exactly what you are referring to. Now that's name recognition.   Centrally situated between Tempe and the beginning of Ahwatukee, B-Co, as I like to call it, is a stone throw from the Elliot exit on I-10.   I'm very accustomed to eating at Amados, so I'm very much an enthusiast of the cheap burrito. B-Co knows how to make a good burrito and charge just a hair more than the Mexican all-night quick stops like Amados.  It's justifiable though considering you can eat on their private outdoor patio or inside where one has the luxury of a television and staff is okay if you change the channel to what you want to see. There are even customer bathrooms outside.   The downside to B-Co is the hours of the restaurant. It does not open on Sundays and if you plan on grabbing a late night snack after the club, the restaurant will be closed.  The Burrito Co. is also pretty skimpy on the amount of chips it gives out, which are by the way never greasy. Meals also take longer to cook than at Amados so you find yourself waiting around with your little number slip in hand moving strategically around the seating area trying not to get in people's way as they navigate the salsa bar or the fountain drink machine.   Still, service always seems to be friendly and having a punch card means that your hundredth or so burrito is free. And free is good, even in Ahwatukee.

Unless you really, really have to see a film when it's first released, then it's worth waiting for it to come to Tempe Cinemas.  This is basically the neighborhood budget movie house that gets films shortly after they leave the mainstream cinemas.   Movies are $3 and popcorn, candy and drinks aren't cheap, but they're not quite expensive as the mainstreams either.  Tuesdays movies are $2 and I believe sodas and popcorn are $2 each as well.  Tempe Cinemas doesn't seem to get overly packed where you really end up with a seat you oppose. It also doesn't fill up with kids.   The floor is a little stickier than a mainstream theatre and the parking lot (in a strip mall) isn't as big as others, but the value is good, their website is informative and there's always a live band performing in the lobby. Although it seems to be the same act every time I go.

Amados is one of those places you might see featured in the movie Clerks if Kevin Smith decided to use a restaurant instead of a convenience store. Dirtbags hanging out on the outside, bizarre people on the inside, but products that you just want to keep going back for.  As my friend used to describe it, "You get a burrito the size of your calf for about 3 bucks."  Amados attracts a mixed clientele from construction workers on their lunch break to high school kids using the patio as their own personal smoke shed to post-clubgoers grabbing a 2 am snack.  The staff is all hispanic and most speak english with a strong accent prevailing, yet in the hundred or so times I've been there my order has never been screwed up.   Breakfast burritos are good and carne asada burritos are so loaded with meat that I often avoid it because it's too heavy a meal. Even the basic bean burrito was too much for my ex to finish each time she ordered it.   It's hard to argue the quality, service and low price even if the parking lot clientele may intimidate you at first glance. Avoid the place after midnight if that's the case. That's when the hoopties are in full swing.

The white picket fences and fake pigs adorning the place doesn't make me feel like in Memphis at a backyard barbecue, but the styling is definitely a bit different than other bbq places.  Some food items are good and others are not. Fortunately you're able to mix and match menu items with the availability of combo plates. Unfortunately, the chance of all those items being good is slim.  Sauces are good, atmosphere tries to be very southern and the menu offers lots of options.  A lot of the food served has more fat than meat though. Portions that should have been cut away are smothered in bbq sauce with the hope you won't notice.   There are better barbecue places in the East Valley, much less the South, which is what this place tries to pattern itself after.

If you've had a wild night at a nightclub and you're looking to get some brunch the next day with a friend to share the details, this restaurant is not the place to do it.   Even if you find a seat here on weekend mornings/afternoons you are right on top of the party next to you, so make sure your conversations are G rated because they will be heard by others.  The Tempe Wildflower gets so busy that I've sometimes left and went to the Chandler Mall location because I know I'd be guaranteed a seat there.  Also, getting in and out of your seat could require repositioning the table and saying "excuse me" more times than you'd like. It really is tight quarters here.  I don't know if the other locations are the same, but this Wildflower runs out of items on a frequent basis. It used to be it only served pretzels on Wednesdays and the store would run out by the afternoon.  Now Wildflower serves them daily and they still run out, but the bigger issue is that there's nowhere to heat them.   Anyone who's spent significant time in northeast knows the value of a good hot pretzel. Wildflower's pretzels are quite good but they come room temp and staff  won't heat them and  only give you the option of the microwave. Gross.   And where's the mustard? That's a necessity.  I always take mine to go.  Cookies also run out and we're not talking an hour before closing. They run out early.   Breakfasts are excellent and although lunch items look delicious, 99.9% of the lunch menu comes with some kind of cheese.   Fruit cups always taste fresh, come with a yogurt and granola drizzle and a slice of carrot cake. The iced tea is excellent but I've heard mixed reviews on the exotic coffees.   The whole rat race idea to get a table on a weekend takes the pleasure away from your meal (if you can secure a table before your meal comes out).   Advice: Utilize that corner spot in the bookstore where they have those goofy novelty items and add some tables there. You won't even have to knock a wall down because the two places connect.  With all the free food you give their employees it's the least they can do for you. It's not like people are crowding that corner of their store to purchase, say, a weiner dog spiral business card holder.   Oh wait, I bought one of those there.   Go to the Chandler Mall location for more room/privacy/personal space. The food is nearly, I stress nearly, identical.

An outstanding, but pricey, breakfast place that's reminiscent of diners of the northeast with waitresses wearing the Daisy Duke version of khaki shorts without the fraying.   It's rare to drive by this place on a weekend morning and not see a crowd of people assembled outside. USE treats its customers waiting to get a seat well though. There's a coffee pot outside for patrons to help themselves. How many restaurants do that?  Word must have gotten around for this place on the corner of Mill and Baseline because I've run into fans in town for a Fiesta Bowl as well as the University of Arizona softball team (Had I of known the girls were going to win the national championship that season I would have gotten autographs).  A variety of different pancake options exist including protein pancakes. That means you could come straight here after a workout!  There's also a variety of different omelet options that most breakfast places in AZ don't offer. What's in a Denver omelet anyway?   What stood out for me was the Manhattan clam chowder. I was impressed the place even had it. Most places in AZ claim "clam chowder" on the menu and if you ask the server if it's Manhattan or New England, he or she doesn't know what you're talking about or says, "the white one."  The Manhattan here was superb with a good tomato base and real minced clams.   USE does well as a breakfast/brunch place and that's where its real focus is. Last I knew it opened very early and closed at 2 p.m. I don't know if that's still the case.  For all I know the waitresses wear pants now. After all, it is winter.   A welcome change from the franchise breakfast places like IHOP, Denny's or Waffle House. Worth the extra money as well.

This place is flat out terrible and cannot hold a candle to the East Valley ballparks. I don't know where these 4-star reviews are coming from.  1.) You are forced to park on premesis which means you have to pay for parking.   Other stadiums let you park about town and walk without fear of getting a ticket, etc.  2.) The walk from the parking lot to the stadium is very long.   If you go to the game without a ticket you will need to park and then head back out into the street to find people selling tickets (they aren't allowed to sell on stadium property) and then walk back to the stadium where you just came from. At other stadiums you park and then walk by numerous people selling tickets by the time you reach the stadium entrance.   3.) It is not handicap accessible.   After parking you walk down a long gravel winding path which would be hell in a wheelchair or arduous on crutches. It could be arduous for the elderly period. It winds around a lake that looks more fake than any of the man made lakes in Tempe.  4.) It's a new stadium built to look old, but not vintage.  Rust colored metal reminiscent of a ski resort or a Colorado lodge.  A far cry from when Baltimore built the Ballpark at Camden Yards to look vintage.  5.) Bad value.  Ticket prices were the highest I experienced. Maybe the others raised theirs too and I didn't realize it, but I've gotten better seats at Giants, Cubs and Angels games for less money.  This place looks like a college campus, which it pretty much is for two baseball teams. Angles, Cubs and Giants offer better value and a better game day atmosphere.  Go back to Vero Beach and take the White Sox with you. If one's not a Dodgers or Pale Hose fan how could anyone honestly say this is a fan-friendly spring training facility?  There's too much in the East Valley for me to venture out that far again.

As a huge baseball fan I've been to numerous college baseball parks around the country, including Alex Box, Mark Light and Rosenblatt. While Packard isn't the most beautiful, it's as, or more, convenient than most.   For years people have been bringing their kids to minor league baseball games  for the value and the experience of seeing possible future major leaguers.  College baseball games are better for that though.  You're guaranteed to see future big leaguers at ASU games and unlike minor league games, some of these are nationally televised. All for a reasonable price.  Parking is very accessible here, even if you have to park in the lot on the other side of Rio Salado. Some college parks don't have their own lots and it's strictly street parking. No matter how late I get to an ASU game I don't have to park too far away.  Tailgating is also pretty convenient at Packard. Street parking usually is not conducive to tailgating so it's not a usual occurrence at all college parks.   Like most college baseball games, a GA ticket could get you a pretty good view. I stood right near the ASU dugout for a Super Regional on a GA ticket.   You are also able to get up close and personal with the road bull pens. You could pretty much have a conversation with the opposing team's reliever while watching him throw through a fence.   If I had kids, ASU baseball would Trump minor league games and probably even Spring Training games as well. It's convenience at a good value.

This place is extremely inefficient and will try to rip you off if you do not have a general familiarity with postal/UPS/FedEx rates.  The previous reviewer said that the longest line in this place is 3 people, however that's the equivalent to 10 at a post office. GPP takes what you want to mail and puts the return address info, as well as the person's info where it is going, into their computer--for each package or envelope one mails.   It is an extreme waste of time. I've still yet to get a good answer as to why they need to input all that info into their computer.  Also, their rates are extremely higher than the Post Office or even card stores that do mailings. They sell flat rate boxes for approximately $2 more than it costs to ship in elsewhere.   I recently sent a package out to NY for $8 and when I went in this week to send the same item in the same envelope to LA I was quoted $6 higher. Once again, I was not given a respectable answer why. I went to a Mesa card store and it was once again $8.  I asked if the postal rates went up from last week to this week  and the clueless woman behind the counter (who had just told a customer before me that rates were going up again in May) said "I don't know."  How you can work in a postal facility and have no idea what basic packages cost to send to certain areas of the country blows my mind.  I even asked if the scale was calibrated properly and I was told it was, but I once mailed something there where the price ended in .02? Nothing in mailing ends in .02 and that should have been a red flag to the employee, but clearly it wasn't.   The Better Business Bureau should check this place out. The only good thing about this place is that you could park in front of the door because hardly anyone goes in there. I found out the hard way why.   Oh, they also do FedEx, however they cannot print out pre-paid labels if you walk in with an authorization number and you'll be sent elsewhere.   Extremely inefficient, poor communication skills and crooked in the way it does business.   I tried to give it zero stars and the Yelp system wouldn't let me. One is too generous.

Good burgers and I'm told the Italian beef is good too but the service is not so good, it's a big high school hangout during the weekday afternoons and they don't cater to customers that come in after 9:30 pm. My email on their website also went unanswered, which was another customer service turnoff to me.  Rosatti's and DeFalcos also have very good Italian beef and there are other good burger joints in the area for this one to be a staple for me.

This place gets very mixed reviews but let's face it, you can get a burger for $2.95 and they will put all the fixings on for you as well as substitute a wheat bun, no charge.   They also read your order back to you both when you order it and when you pick it up at the counter. I don't think this is trying to be the best burger place in town, but rather a convenient one without a drive-thru. Plus their bbq sauce, which is kept behind the counter, is excellent.   Sometimes I just want to get a burger without the fries and drink and cater it my way. Here I pay three and change and I'm out the door. Plus their milk shakes are excellent, food is made to order and not under a lamp and if you stay and eat there, seating is in abundance, there are misters outside and the drink selection is plentiful.

$5 Ahi tuna tacos, $4.50 wings (that are not small) for happy hour and a Coach Erickson sighting (he's apparently a partner). What more could you ask for? I know, I know, a Coach Graham sighting.  Personally though, I've been there a few times and never saw anyone playing pool. If they got rid of all the tables but one and moved that one to the front left corner, they could make that large wood floor space a dancefloor, bring in a deejay and have a booming nightlife there as well as good food.   That floor space is also large enough to host live local music.   They seem to hold the service to a high level too as our waitress was excellent the first few times we came and then when our server changed things changed a bit as well.   A promising place nonetheless that's large, has an abundance of good flatscreens, good happy hour food specials and often times good service.
