Another Lunch Dive near work . . . and again . . . pleasently surprized.  Located in a non-descript old strip center located behind a seven-eleven.  Had the Gyro Pita Sandwich with Fries and a Drink . . . the Gyro was tasty, but could have used a little more meat and tomatoes . . . the Fries were somewhere between a regular sized fry and a steak fry.  Very hot and crispy, just the way I like my Fries.  Lots of the lunch crowd was having the pizza, and the smell was . . . well lets just say . . . if I wasn't already full, or was waiting to order . . . it would have been pizza for me also . . . NEXT TIME.  And yes . . . This place is definately on my return list.

Haven't been to this place in about 10 years . . . and it was exactly like I remembered it . . . even to the pale green walls . . . how sad.  This place has a very limited buffet menu and I tried about 7 of the 10 items . . . so here we go . . . Fried Won Ton . . . Nothing Special Vegetable Chow Main . . . Tasted more like Spaghetti than Chow Mein Noodles Vegetable Fried Rice . . . Bland White Rice with Vegetables Orange Chicken . . . This was actually pretty good . . . SURPRISE Vegatable Egg Roll . . . Luke warm and more wrapper than filling Deep Fried Zuccini . . . Cold Sweet and Sour Pork . . . Runny Sauce and Fried Pork lacked and flavor  So in a nut shell . . . Food on the lower end of the scale . . . Price was CHEAP . . . and that is why it got 2 stars.  It might be another 10 years before I come back again.

Another very good lunch outing today with more clients.  The restaurant was pretty busy . . . but the food was unbelievable.  The reason for only getting four stars was there was a considerable wait . . . about 20 minutes . . . from the time that we ordered until our food arrived.  And though that is not a long time . . . for a salad, a wrap, a sandmich, and a burger . . . it seemed a little excesive . . . maybe if the waiter had checked back at some point to give a quick update it would have lessoned the wait.  Well, on to the food . . . the Steak Burger was out of this world . . . the seasoning and flavors were great and it meat was cooked perfectly medium . . . just a little pink and still juicy.  The fries were nothing special, but they were hot and crisp.  The iced tea was fresh brewed . . . how do I know . . . it kept melting the ice.  All in all . . . a very good dining experience today . . . hope to be back soon to try something different from the menu.

WHOO HOO . . . My 100th Review  This place was definitely a great choice for a 100th review . . . I would have hated it if it was a bad review . . . but . . . this place rocked.  We were seated quickly and our waitress took our drink order . . . told us of their lunch specials and returned promptly to take our order.  For me . . . Iced Tea, Pastrami Melt with French Fries and a side of Coleslaw.  Iced Tea was fresh and clear and ice cold . . . Coleslaw was crunchy with just the right amount of dressing, not limp and watery . . . French Fries were hot, crisp and firm . . . and the Pastrami Melt was down right heavenly.  My only reason for not giving five stars was the noise level . . . there were times that I could not hear my lunch partner speak . . . I may be a little hard of hearing, but I am not that bad . . . This place is definitely on the I'LL BE BACK list . . .

No longer a Korean Cuisine Virgin . . . and even though I have nothing to compare this place too . . . it was fabulous.  First the Service . . . Seating quickly and our drink order was taken immediately.  When the waitor return with the drinks, he walked us through their menu . . . pointing out his favorite dishes . . . but more importantly . . . helping us decide between the two  dishes we were interested in . . . this is great since at that point I was still a korean cuisine virgin.  My choice . . . with my wiater's recommendation . . . Nakji Dol Pan . . . Octopus stir fried in a spicy sauce and served on a sizzling stone plate.  Second the Food . . . the food came quickly and was unbelievable . . . though spicy, not too spicy . . . however, the spiciness does grow on you over time.  The octopus, was cooked perfectly and almost melted in your mouth . . . and the side enhanced the overall taste of the dish.  I will now definately try other Korean Restaurants . . . but it will be hard to surpass the experience I have here at Hodori Restaurant.

Saw the perfect Valentine's Day gift for my spouse, and trekked off to macy's to see if I could find it.  Told the clerk at the jewelry counter what I was looking for, and after she reviewed the inventory, informed me that they were currently out of that item.  Since she wasn't sure when they would be getting any more in . . . she suggested purchasing it on line.  Not a rookie when it comes to ordering on-line, I decided that would be the best way to obtain the gift.  Placed the order, paid for the express shipping . . . and here were are two days before Valentine's Day, and still no gift in hand.  It has been a week since I ordered it, and the UPS tracking says that delivery should be tomorrow.  After an hour on the phone with customer service to see what the problem with the express shipping was and could I get a refund since I seem to have been sent normal delivery . . . I was told that Macy's does not refund shipping fees, because once it leaves their warehouse, they are no longer responsible.  Was instructured to contact UPS and complain.  Whatever happened to customer service.

Ok . . . It's Father's Day . . . and Dad get to choose the Restaurant . . . YEAH . . . not really . . . no one liked my choices . . . with that said . . . the Family agreed on Romano's Macaroni Grill . . . haven't been here in a couple of years . . . but we'll give it a go, because when we lived closer it was one of our GO TO Restaurants.  BIG MISTAKE . . . read some reviews prior to getting here and so I was getting a little worried . . . but here is the scoring.  Service  -  1 STAR  -  Our server was great, very attentive.  Appetizers  -  0 STAR  -  Marcaroni and Cheese bites GOOD / Prochutto and Mozzarella tasted like a salt lick / Margarita Pizza was stewed tomatos on flat bread, tasteless and cheeseless.  Main Course - 0 STAR - Lasagna tasted old and very very dried out / Shimp Alfedo was sauceless and 4 pieces of shrimp / Chicken Alfredo made the Shrimp Alfred look great.  Desert - 0 Star - Cheesecake was dry and the edges looked and were hard as rock / tirramisu was tastless  Ambience - 0 Stars - dusty pictures / food stained menus / dirty plates on tables.  Sure wish I know what happened to this place . . . it use to be GREAT . . . now it looks like a place that has fallen on hard times . . . bland / dry italian food food (what happened to the great sauces that use to exist here) and an overall staff that seemed pretty lifeless.  Sad to say . . . I probably will not be back.

The family decided to bring me here for my Father's Day dinner.  We had reservations and were seated immediately upon arrival . . . the waitress took our drink orders and returned with the drinks and took our order.  The Montana Mule was good . . . but could have used a little less ginger beer and a little more bourbon.  The filet was cook perfectly . . . the rice and potatoes were hot and tasty . . . the onion strings were hot and crispy . . . and the mud pie was just the perfect finish.   The reason for only four stars . . . two of the five steaks were not cook right . . . but were still good.  Definitely a return trip restaurant . . .

Let me premise this by saying that I can't give a drive-thru car wash five stars . . . but this place comes close.  The 98 BWM 740i came out looking almost like a new car . . . and at only  $9.00 for the GOLD service, it is affordable oin a weekly basis.  We definitely be back before my road trip later this month . . . VEGAS her we come.

Hadn't been to this Cracker Barrel in quite a while, but with a new project starting up in the area, thought I would stop in and have lunch . . . it appears that they hadn't missed a beat.  We were seating quickly, and our waitress stopped almost immediately to take our drink order.  When she returned with our drinks she was ready to take our order.  The food came quickly and was hot and delicious . . . I ordered the Grilled Rueben with Steak Fries . . . thought I would treat myself to some desert today . . . and a nice slice of pecan pie sounded just wonderful . . . but that is were they lost a star . . . I was informed that pecan pie was only seasonal . . . WHAT . . . a southern style restaurant without pecan pie . . . on well, maybe next time.

Stopped here for lunch with some co-workers on our way back to the office after an interview.  Was seated quickly and our server arrived shortly there after to take our drink order . . . drinks arrived and our order was immediately taken.  Quick service.  While waiting for our food we received a telephone call letting us know that we had gotten the project . . . whoo hoo a $13,000,000.00 school . . . just wat the doctor ordered.  Back to the food . . . it arrived quickly and hot . . . ordered the Chili Relleno . . . which tasted great, along with the corn bread.  So why only four stars you ask . . . I have to go back once the high from getting the new project wears off . . . just to verify that they do deserve five stars . . . didn't what my judgement clouded.  With that said . . . see you here again soon . . .

Have been wanting to play one of the two Whirlwind Courses for sometime and finally got my chance by playing in a fund raiser for a local educational foundation . . . the course we played was Devil's Claw.  The layout was was similar to most desert courses that I have played, the difference was that the coursed was in imcaulate shape and even for an average golfer (16 handicapped) . . . I felt that I had a chance for a par on every tee box.  Played well but was definatley saved by my putting today . . . made four putts over 25 feet . . . found these greens relativly easy to read, which was nice.  Only two draw back were the heat by the time we got to the last four holes . . . and the reason for only getting four stars . . . the beverage cart was very slow today.  I know it was probably due to the high volume of players, but felt it was still worthy of losing a star over.  Will definately be back to play again when the weather cools down.

Planned a little day trip and drive to Florence, Arizona, and knew I had to stop here for lunch.  Hadn't been here in about four years, but seemed to have remembered liking this place . . . and my memory was correct.  The beer was good and cold . . . had a couple of Shock Top drafts . . . the wait staff and bartenders were cheerful and talkative . . . the atmosphere was as I remembered it . . . kinda biker / dive barish.  Ordered the Road King burger and steak fries . . . burger was good, not great (three napkins), and would have like it a little less done (more toward medium) . . . and the steak fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside . . . just the way I like them.  I will definitely be back . . . even if I have to plan a day trip again.

Making BBQ pork ribs for dinner tonight . . . and nothing compares to the pork from here . . . fresh, tasty, and priced right.  Had to pick-up some meat stick also . . . they smelled so good . . . I had to have one before I got home.  The place is small, but the employees are very helpful, and they move you in and out very quickly . . . returning is inevitable . . . next time I will be cooking with pork.

This little hidden gem is a great place for lunch, after work, or late night.  Today we came for lunch and I ordered the Fish and Chips, and an Iced Tea.  Service was quick, food came out quick, and was  nice and hot.  The fish was a very light and flakey cod seasoned just right.  The tarter sauce had a nice little tang to it.  The chips "fries" were your typical shoe string variety.  Have two complaints, one is that the chairs at the bar are tables are a little uncomportable for us larger folks, and two, would like the lighting to be a little brighter.  I know it's a bar, but this is lunch time, not after work bar time.

This place rocked . . . especially after the last dive bar we were at.  Greeted immediately upon entering . . . we never needed to wait for a refill . . . which was great especially since this place was busy.  Since it was lunch time we ordered a pizza . . . and the bartender talked us down from the Friggin Huge to a Medium . . . we were glad . . . since we barely finish the pizza.  The music was great . . . the surfer theme worked well . . . this is definitely a place that we will visit again on another trip to Las Vegas.

With all the great reviews . . . this place was on my definitely stopping list . . . boy what a disappointment.  First . . . the décor was older, quaint, and Midwestern . . . but the dust on some of the things looked like it had been there a while . . . definitely in need of a good dusting.  Second . . . the food was luke warm, tasteless, and very disappointing.  Order the biscuits and gravy with a side of extra biscuits . . . while the first biscuit was great, the side biscuits looked, tasted, and the texture of dinner rolls.  And though I new the potatoes were home chips . . . they tasted stale and were not crunchy.  All thing considered . . . not one of my better breakfast choices . . . not sure if I will ever be back.

Now this is what a dive bar should be like . . . cold, cheap drinks . . . semi dark, with friendly regulars . . . an attentive bartender . . . and a mural behind the bar with an unbelievable story.  This place made you feel like home . . . even if you were from out of town and just in for a visit.  I will definitely be back to further explore the mural . . . it seem like every time a looked at it I saw something different.  If the neighbor ever comes back . . . this place will definitely become a five star spot.  And if not . . . it is still on my shall return list.

Need to stock for my brother arrival for March Madness . . . stumbled across this place while out looking for a liquor store.  With our tastes, it is sometime hard to find what I need . . . Speakeasy had it all . . . one stop and back to the Casino for some good drinks and some great basketball.

Started out our last full day in Las Vegas by stopping by this downtown dive bar . . . would have stopped the night before, but the parking lot was full of about 150 bicycles doing a dive bar riding tour.  This is a quaint little joint that brought back memories of younger years with cheap can beer and a great selection of liquors.  Since it was early in the day, there was no karaoke . . . but we will have to save that for our next visit.  The dollar bills added to the decor . . . and half the fun of our short stay was reading the names and locations.  Definitely on the TO BE REVISITED list on my next trip to Las Vegas.

Okay . . . I knew this on was a gay bar . . . did not tell my brother though . . . since the name of the bar was the name of our childhood dog.  A small bar with a little character . . . and I'm not talking about the bartender.  Besides the stiff drinks, the bartender let us choose a couple of songs to be played while we drank . . . Everyone is Gay by A Great Big World and I'm Shipping Up To Boston by Dropkick Murphys . . . I'm pretty sure this place had never heard that kind of music before.  And the other highlight was talking to another patron about dinner the night before . . . and having him tell my brother he should slap him for ordering a cheeseburger at a Cajun restaurant . . . now, I would have paid to see that.  I am not sure if I will ever make if back . . . but it is on my return list.

Hopefully this place is better a night . . . but we were here during the late morning . . . and did we get looked at very strangely by the regulars all sitting at the bar . . . it was full by the way . . . and it was kinda creepy.  Thought if we found two seats at the bar . . . we would get people telling us to get out of Betsy's and Carl's seats or something.  The set-up looked pretty good for a local band to play and would probably be good for that . . . problem is . . . when I am in Las Vegas . . . I spend evening at the hotel and casino I am staying at.  Bottom line . . . I probably won't be back . . .

What a surprise . . . originally from southeastern Wisconsin . . . stumbling into a Wisconsin bar located in Las Vegas.  The décor and memorabilia was just great . . . and being able to see the brew kettles made it even better.  Had there beer of the day . . . and while it was good and tasty . . . it could have been a bit colder.  Ordered the Bid Dog Nachos with Grilled Chicken . . . typical bar nachos . . . but the chicken tasted a bit like deli chicken . . . and not fresh grilled chicken.  I am probably giving it an extra star . . . being from Wisconsin . . . but with a little work on the beer temperature and updating ingredients, this place good be a GREAT sports bar.

Have been to this restaurant many times before, so when a freind recommended meeting here for breakfast today . . . I said great.  Not really sure what has happened . . . but this place has really gone down hill.  Service was a little slow . . . definitely could use more than three servers with a almost full restaurant.  Food took a little longer than I remembered . . . and when it arrived . . . it was missing a pancake . . . which my server told me would be coming, since they only made two and not three.  This was probably the only really good thing about the meal . . . becasue by the time the missing pancake arrive . . . I had finished the other, and it was nice to have a hot one.  Definitely not my first choice . . . but would return . . . if not in a hurry . . .

BUTCHER SHOP ONLY  Been a regular this butcher shop for years . . . until I moved even farther out . . . but this morning I thought some great steaks sounded good . . . so with that I decided to make the long trek back to this long forgotten butcher shop.  It was definitely worth the trip . . . the service was great . . . quick . . . and attentive . . . even though as always . . . they were extremely busy.  Not only did I pick out some great steaks . . . I also picked-up some brats / hot dogs / kabobs . . . all grilled up great.  It had been way too long since my last visit . . . but next time . . . and there will be a next time . . . it needs to be much sooner . . .

Have an older model BMW and though I would call it my "baby" . . . I do have to note that at this time . . . it is my only mode of transportation.  So I have been looking for a good old reliable Oil Change place for some time . . . and I believe I have found it.  Brought my own oil filter, since most place don't carry a BMW oil filter . . . and to my surprise the owner was okay with that . . . but even better . . . he actually stocks them . . . he has to charge more than I pay for them, but this is nice to know . . . especially if I don't happen to stop by the BMW parts department before the next oil change.  The owner even knew that with the bigger BMW engine it would need more oil than a smaller engine . . . and filled up the oil in increments until it was at the propoer level.  While not the cheapest oil change place around . . . it is definately worth the trip.  But most importantly . . . I have found my oil change headquarters for the remainder of my BMW's life . . . See you again in 4000 miles.

The bank is terrible . . . I wish I could get my wife to change banks . . . good thing I only have to come here once every two weeks.  First, typically there are only two teller working, with three people in the buisness line and six or eight people in the personal banking line . . . MORE tellers please.  Second, why do we have three people greeting me and wanting to send me over to a personal banker . . . I just want to make a deposit . . . and NO . . . you screw up the ATM deposits so much, I NEED to make sure a real person takes the check and inputs the deposit into you computer system.  And  Third, no drive through banking . . . are you nuts . . .

Saw a television ad the night before for a Carls Jr. Jim Beam Bourbon burger . . . and boy did that look good . . . so today for lunch we headed out to try one.  Very BIG dissappointment . . . the burger was dry, the bacon was burnt, and the sauce . . . where was it . . . not on my burger.  I was truly looking forward to one juicy messy burger that oozed and dripped goodness all over . . . and this was not the the burger for that.  To finish out the order . . . I had onion rings . . . nice and crispy, but not real hot / warm . . . and a coke . . . which was kinda on the flat side.  Not my idea of a good burger joint for lunch.

After some great dive bar stops on this trip to Las Vegas . . . we one that we probably should have skipped . . . Country meet Heavy Metal . . . REALLY.  Anyways . . . took about 5 minutes before the bartender acknowledge us and took our drink order . . . after that . . . she never came back to see if we needed another, or even to start up a conversation . . . too interested in the regulars sitting playing video poker.  We left after the one drink . . . and were glad to see this place in the rearview mirror as we moved on down the road.

Still our Hotel and Casino of Choice . . . Especially since the wife won a $5,400.00 jackpot this visit . . . Me a $3,700.00 jackpot (oh yeah, mine was out at another casino).  Major problem . . . and it appeared to not just be our room in the Ruch Tower . . . but there was a sewer gas smell in our room all weekend . . . even after housekeeping tried to put something down the drain.  We will be back, since nothing in the area compares . . . but if the smell hasn't been taken care of . . . we might not be back after that . . .

This place started out rough . . . the Guinness keg needed to be changed out . . . but the bartender made it up . . . two 3/4 full mugs for the price of one . . . NICE SAVE.  The whiskey and coke was proportioned just right . . . not a single shot . . . and not over poured . . . just perfectly poured . . . about a shot an a half.  She mentioned that we could order food from next door . . . but we were not hungry at the time . . . only thirsty . . . and since it tasted so good, we deviated from our rule and had three drinks.  Since this place was so good during the day . . . I'm betting that it is even better at night . . . with that said . . . it is definitely on my return trip list.

On my list of Dive Bars to visit when in Las Vegas . . . and so we stopped for a quick one before heading back to our hotel.  Best part . . . I drank for free . . . because I was playing video poker.  Not a bad set-up . . . but will all the glass doors . . . you get a feeling that it is kind or small.  Though we did not eat any thing, the food smelled wonderful.  I will most likely be back on another trip to try this place for lunch . . . only because when I am in Las Vegas . . . I like to dinner out at nicer restaurants . . . and this place has more of that homey atmosphere.

Two stars because the beer was cheap and really cold . . . other than that . . . this place for a dive bar fell short for me.  The interior décor was too light and bright for me . . . and while there was only one other guy in the place . . . the bartender did not strike up a conversation with any of us . . . leaving this place a one beer stop.  Can't say I won't be back . . . but with plenty of other cheap drink dive bars near the strip . . . this would not be my first choice.

This place took me back to my midwest roots of bars . . . a great talkative bartender . . . great local regulars who weren't afraid to get into a conversation with you.  Had the bartender suprize me with my drink . . . DON"T LAUGH . . . a "White Gummy Bear" . . . not sure what was in it, but it was a great tasty drink to end the afternoon partion of the dive bar tour.  I will definately be back on future tour to Las Vegas . . . if for nothing else to see the Karoake.

Had been to Macayo's in the Phoenix area countless time, but today on our Dive bar tour . . . we decided to stop in for lunch . . . One BIG Mistake.  The service was terrible . . . the server took our drink order . . . and THREE bowls of chips and salsa later . . . she was back with the drinks and took our order.  Another two bowls of chips later . . . the food arrived.  Problem was . . . it was COLD and GREASY.  Saving grace was that we ate enough chips to fill up . . . we definitely not be back.

This was the second stop on todays Dive Bar tour . . . and it did not disappoint.  The interior atmosphere was great . . . drinks and refills came promptly and were tasty and cold.  The Place was filled with with about six locals who took us under their wing and made us feel right at home.  Definately . . . worth the stop.

The Seediest Dive Bar of the Day . . . but everyonse needs one of these every once in a while . . . and this is one is definately worth the trip.  Olympia Beer . . . High School Memories abound . . . A$$ Juice . . . The signiture drink, and suprizingly, it was really pretty good . . . And another group of locals bought me a Bacon Martini, not really good, but FREE is FREE.  Definitely what most people would think of when asked to discribe a Dive Bar . . . DON"T CHANGE . . . this is one of those guilty pleasures and you need take in evey now and then to remind you of your youth.

Okay . . . This review is from a guy . . . and I'm pretty sure . . . my wife would not like this place . . . but for a place to go with a bunch of guys . . . this is the place.  Bartenders in "daisy dukes" and bikini tops . . . yelling at patrons through megaphones . . . dancing on the bar . . . and tossing back shots.  Definitely a guy bar . . . although . . . there were plenty of women as well . . . but still it is on my shall return list.

Finally after 20 some odd years, I am finally eating here . . . though not for breakfast, but for a light business lunch.  We were seated quickly, and our drink order taken . . . shortly after our drinks arrived, our wiatress returned to tak our order . . . I ordred the Balsamic Florentine Chicken Grille Sandwich.  The sandwich arrived in a reasonable amount of time . . . and was unbelievable.  The chicken was hot and moist . . . the mushroooms with the balsamic dressing were sweet and tasty . . . the cibatta roll was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  The black bean side salad was also good . . . the problem was I wanted to finish my whole sandwich . . . so I did have some salad left over.  The reason for the loss of a star was simple . . . our waitress did stop back and check on us once, but since we were there for over an hour . . . I would have light to have had somewon from the restaurant check back with us.  Return trip . . . Most Definitely . . .

Decided to take a couple of my clients out to lunch today to a restaurant that I had been to before.  As in my prior visits, the wait staff was very attentive to our needs, check back multiple times to see how we were doing and in our drinks needed refillings.  For Lunch I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich on 9 grain bread  and Steak Fries.  The sandwich was very tasty with just the right amount of seasoning and mayo, so that it was not soggy and messy.  The others in the party ordered the French Dip with French Fries, and the Fish Sandwich with French Fries.   Both liked their sandwiches and on the way back to the office asked for the address several times, so they could return.  My only issue on this visit was that the steak fries were not as hot and crispy has I have had in the past, otherwise it would have been a five.

A co-worker and myself decided to make this our last lunch before Christmas stop.  And while I have been here a couple of times before . . . I noticed that I had never written a review.  I had The Royale with Cheese a side of their British Style Baked Beans, and a Boddington . . . the pasty as always was out of this world, hot, juicy, cheesy, and full of flavor . . . the beans were a disappointment, dry, lacking in flavor, however, very spicy . . . the beer was a little on the warm side and had to let it rest before I would drink it.  Ultimately, you come for the pasties, and as always they were great . . . with a little work on the other two items . . . five stars is easily attainable . . . and yes . . . this place is as always is definitely on the I WILL BE BACK list.

One of my all time favorite lunch spots . . . it was time to stop in again with a client who was looking for somethiing a little different.  I ordered the Mexican Pizza . . . the flat bread was hot and fresh, the beans were warm and tender, the lettuce was crispy, and the marinated chicken was just perfect.  The only issue was we seemed to be lost . . . the waiter did stop back several times . . . but usually when the drinks had been empty for a while.  Definitely have missed having lunch here and I will be back sooner than later.

A typical college bar that could be located just off any college campus in america.  Drinks were reasonably priced . . . with a good selection of midwestern beers . . . what memories.  The bartender "Mikal" was the Bomb . . . she had more blond jokes than anyone I know . . . most of which I have never heard . . . she even laughed at my lame jokes.  A definate spot to stop if one either a dive bar tour or looking for a college bar to hang-out at.

Been wanting to try this place for a long time . . . however . . . even reading  the clues on how to open the door to enter so you don't look foolish . . . still didn't work, but still got in.  This place was everything other before me have posted . . . great ambience . . . great music . . . unbelievable drinks . . . it was definitely one of the highlights of our evening.  But then why only 4 stars . . . well . . . the place was semi busy, but with only one mixologist . . . it took way to long to get our drinks . . . but definitely on my list of returns spots.

This place has an unbelievable atmosphere . . . thought I was in a gothic building complete with fire pits and stone columns . . . and the drinks and extensive shot  menu was impressive.  It was great place to hang out with friends . . . and kick back . . . only draw back was that even with three bartenders . . . they had trouble keeping up with the crowd.   It is a definitely on the shall be back list . . .

Thre first time I tried this place a couple of years ago . . . I swore I would never be back . . . however . . . this trip my brother talked me into going again, because he wanted fish tacos.  Service . . . waited almost 10 minutes for the waitress to acknowlege us . . . another 10 minutes until she was back to take our order . . . and after the food came, we had to track her down to get the bill . . . kind of wonder if we left without paying if she would have noticed.  Food . . . crab cake sliders . . . four different topings . . . cold crab cakes . . . extremely hot buns . . . I was confused . . . and my taste buds were definitely not happy.  Return . . . highly unlikely

The Arizona Republic gets 1 star, because Yelp does not allow for ZERO STARS.  I have been getting the Arizona republic for about 15 years now . . . until today . . . I CANCELLED MY SUSCRIPTION ! ! !  Where to begin . . . orinally I recevied seven days a week for great price . . . then with the advent of on-line publication, they reduced the home delivery to only 4 days a week, but for the same price, still a good deal . . . last month paid the bill for my continued seervice, and today received a call saying I was behind on my payments.  After reviewing my checking account, I can clearly see that the check had cleared . . . so . . . called customer service . . . and was told that the price that I originally paid for a year at 7 days a week, was now the monthy rate . . . THANKS FOR THE WARNING . . . I would have cancelled sooner.  Customer Service people . . . and I talked to four different people . . . were all rude, obnoxious, and didn't care a rat's a$$ about the customer.  Good riddens Arizona Republic . . . another newspaper that will soon be gone . . . what a shame . . .

Drove around looking for a place for dinner, and just happened to stumble across this place . . . though we would park in the back since most of the front stalls were already taken . . . glad we did the entrance is hidden near the back of the restaurant.  Getting in was a trip . . . but I will not spoil that here . . . that is for you to find out.  Since we did not have reservations and were really pretting hungry . . . we opted for eating at the bar near the kitchen . . . this was like eating at a chef's table in some high dollar restaurant only fun.  The inside decor took us back to the days of what it must have been like back when mobsters ran Las Vegas.  We started off with the stuffed mushrooms . . . Great choice, they we unbelievable . . . then a house salad . . . perfect with just the right amount of itialian dressing . . . and a main course of the lasagna with an extra meatball . . . even though I was starving coming in . . . it was too much for me, but was so tasty that I coulldn't stop.  Our server asked us if we would like desert . . . I always like to look . . . and even tough stuffed . . . I had to try the cannolies . . . out of this world.  We must have done something right though . . . because after we paid the bill and were getting ready to leave . . . out server asked us if we would liike to enter the PRIVATE cigar room for a cigar and some congac . . . not sure how many get to experience this, but it was unbelievable . . . and if I told you who we met and rubbed elbows with . . . well you know what I'd have to do.  This place will definitely be on my to do again list for the next time I visit Las Vegas.

Yesterday morning as I was leaving for work, the garage door did not open . . . just what I didn't need . . . got to get to work and the car is now stuck in the garage . . . so I Googled garage door service and called three places that said they had 24 hour service . . . Overhead was the only one to answer the phone, and for that matter, the only repair service people I talked to all day.  Donnie, the service manager, was great . . got me scheduled and told me that I would be getting a follow up call from the technician when he was on is way to my house, sometime around 11:00 a.m.  Here is my only knock to there service and to me it cost them the fifth star . . . the service technician got hung up at the job before mine and even though the office staff knew . . . no one called to alert me.  Tommy, the service technician was unbelievable . . . quick, knowledgeable and took the time to access any other possible problems.  He change out two springs, fixed a door strut issue . . . which he did not charge for . . . and now the garage door opens again and has never opened this smoothly or quietly.  Would I use Overhead Door again . . . YES . . . problem is , I may never have too.

Would never have seen my self going out to lunch with a client to a restaurant that did not have waiters / waitresses . . . but was glad the client chose this place.  I ordered the Sedona Sandwich and the Jalapeno Queso with Chips.  The food came relatively quick and was warm and very tasty . . .  the sandwich had a great balance of flavors and very enjoyable . . . while the queso had just the right amount of kick.  The place was clean, and the staff was nice and friendly . . . my problem is that I have trouble giving a restaurant five stars if it does not have a wait staff . . . but this place was very, very close.  this place is definitely on my return list.

Been to many Sonic restaurants before, so I knew what I wanted before I was even at the call button . . . 2 chicago dogs / large onion ring / medium limeade.  Boy what a disappointment . . . the hot dog buns were so soggy that on the first bite, everything fell out and left me a relish and mustard mess . . . the rings weren't any better, soggy and the onion still tasted raw . . . well at least there was the limeade . . . where's the lime, tasted like sprite.  Will definitely not be back to this Sonic . . .

Had to withdraw some quick cash today . . . Friday you know.  So I ran over quick to this location (which I have fequented before), to grab the funds . . .  As always, the employees were cheerful, courteous, and didn't try to offer you any unneed services.  Three people ahead of my, and guess what . . . Three tellers . . . the visit was quick . . . and I was outta there.  Nothing worse than going to the bank and spending 20 - 30 minutes in line . . . only complaint . . . I wish the withdrawal limit at the drive-thru was higher . . . if I only wanted a couple hundred dollars, I would have used the ATM.

Thought I's make a quick stop on my way home and pick-up dinner . . . and not being shy about the great dinner atmosphere of my vehicle . . . decided to stop at this Burger King for a quick and easy dinner . . . my mistake.  First . . . I barely got to the menu board, and was greeted to place my order . . . this was great . . . since I already knew what I was going th order . . . (2) BK Bacon Burgers and a medium Coke.  Second . . . Got to the drive up window and was greeted nicely . . . given my drink and my change . . . and was ready to make a quick exit.  Three . . . Wait . . . Wait . . . Wait . . . Finally . . . Five minutes later my food finally made to my vehicle through the drive-up window . . . O.K. I can live with this becasue a minute wait means hot and fresh.  Four . . . Very Bad ASSUMPTION . . . Burgers were cold and dry . . . bacon tasted burnt . . . bun was hard . . . on the good side . . . the coke was cold and tasted good.  Needless to say . . . I did not finish my quick dinner, because it was terrible . . . and settled for a BPJ Sandwich when I finally got home.

Had to run my father-in-law to Phoenix today, and so I told him I would take him out to lunch.  Having recently seen this place on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, I though we would give it a try.  We were pleasantly surprised . . . the staff was great . . . the food was wonderful . . . the only draw back was the noise level due to all of the hard surfaces.  I had the French Onion Burger and my father-in-law had the Chicken Salad  Sandwich.  Mine was cooked perfectly . . . nice and juicy and the arugala add just enough to take it to the next level.  The iced tea was fresh brewed and my glass never got less than half full before it was topped off.  Will definitely be back . . . Hope to try the weekend brunch items (the pan fried pan cake) and also dinner.  Why only four stars . . . the noise level . . . hopefully dinner will be a little quieter.

It a new year and like many of us . . . it's time to try and eat health for a while.  And since I had recently seen an ad for the under 500 calorie bowls I thought I would try one . . . I ordered the Black Bean Bowl.  The Bowl it self had a very good taste . . . but was way too running for my liking . . . and the broccoli was way under cooked.  The service was okay but could have been faster.  Even though this trip was not very good . . . I will probably stop in to try another one of their under 500 calorie bowls sometime down the road . . . after all even two stars for something healthy is better than one star.

I was really surprised to see how dead this place was today . . . not too long ago, I could remember having to wait for a table at lunch if you weren't here by 11:30.  This had me a little worried, but I was pleasently surprized.  I ordered the Southwestern Chicken Salad and an Iced Tea.  The drink arrived quickly and tasted freshk brewed, was clear, and cold.  My lunch arrived shorly later and I was  extremely happy . . . the salad wad still cold, and the chicken was nice and hot.  With all of the toppings, the salad was full of flavors and the spices on the chicken were just right.  Hopefully time will get better and this place will pick-up again for the lunch rush . . . even though I did like like it like this.

Have been here before a couple of times for business lunches, but todays was definitely not good.  I ordered the mini pizza with side salad and an iced tea.  The salad was a little gritty like it had been cleaned properly, and the mini pizza veggies were still crunchy with cheese that had not melted entirely.  I was truly disappointed, since this was my FIRST bad experience here.  Hopefully it was a one time occurance, because this place tends to be our company's GO TO restaurant for business lunches.

Problem one . . . thought I knew what I was going to order before I got there (snuck a peek at there menu) . . . but the menu was just too larger for me to decide.  With that said . . . I let the person buying lunch decide for me . . . their choice for me . . . the Jewish Sliders.  Problem two . . . they were so good that three didn't seem like enough while I was devouring them.  Good thing I didn't order more . . . after a long conversation catching up with my friend . . . I realized that three was just right.  The food was good and hot, moist and tasty, and the pickles were just enough garlicy.  I will definately be back.  Oh, why not five stars . . . the air conditiong was blasting . . . and even though it is Arizona and over a hundred degrees outside . . . it was darn right chilly inside . . . turn that thermostat up about 5 degrees . . . please.

First thing I have to say . . . is that I am sorry for visiting anouther Steakhouse in the Area two nights before . . . and had a Five Star Experience their . . . with that said . . . I would probably have given Binion's a five if it were not for the wine service.  The ambience was very nice and high class . . . took me back to the days of Classy Vegas . . . problem . . . kind of warm . . . would have been nice if it was about 5 degrees cooler.  The appetizer . . . Blue Crab Cakes . . . Full of crab, crunchy, and very tasty . . . would have liked to have had a few larger chuncky of crab meat.  Dinner . . . Chicken Fried Lobster . . . I have now died and gone to heaven . . . the cruchy out side, the melt in you mouth inside.  Desert . . . Creme Brule . . . Small Portion and very cold . . . tasted like it had been made the day before and placed in the cooler . . . berrys were room temperature and not very appealling.  View . . . Best in Vegas . . . most likely will return,

Another ethnic food checked of my list . . . I am no longer a Vietnamese food virgin any more . . . okay . . . at least not a Pho virgin any more . . . and I was truly delighted by the pho.  First, the ambience in this place was above what I was expecting for another strip mall restaurant . . . which raised my expectations to a little higher standard.  Started of with the Spicy Mussels . . . my waitress said I could have them from a hotness scale of 1 to 5 . . . so to be safe . . . I chose 3 . . . the spiciness was just perfect for me and the overall presentation was great . . . however . . . next time I am going to try them at a 4.  For my entrée, I ordered the Pho Da Lat Special Pho . . . it came out hot and the noodles and proteins were tender and delicious . . . again . . . I did not add any extra sauces . . . preferring to enjoy the pho as presented . . . however . . . I might had a little hoisin sauce next time.  My only regret was not trying what looked like a smoothie that I noticed some people completing their meal with . . . oh well . . . there is always next time . . . and yes . . . there will definitely be a next time . . .

I co worker wanted to do sushi for his Birthday Lunch . . . and so I recommended this place since I have had great luck here before . . . godd thing he is not a big sushi person since he thought it was great, and I . . . well not so much this time.  We were seated promptly and our waiter came and got our drink order . . . Green Iced tea for me and a soda for the Birthday boy . . . hard to screw up a soda, but the green tea tasted water down and was cloudy . . . obviously not a fresh brew  (minus one star).  We both ordered the seaweed salad . . . and since I had eaten it before, I was really looking forward to it . . . the seaweed was great, but more than half the salad was arugula . . . really arugula . . . are you kidding me, I ordered a seaweed salad  (minus one half star).  Along with the salad we ordered a Lotus Roll . . . rices was not sticky, so the roll fell apart . . . the lobster was luke warm and way to chewy . . . whats going on . . . those appetizers were my go to items  (minus one half star).  Entree my friend had the tempura shimp, and I had the Koshou Beef . . . the beef was tough and chewy, shitaki mushrooms were almost unrecognizable, the asparagas was over cooked and mushy . . . and the sauce . . . well lets just say it had a burnt taste to it . . . overall not a very good entree  (minus one star).  The atmosphere and service were good . . . but again . . . nothing to write home about.  I am hoping this was just an overall bad day for the this place, because it has been great in the past . . . only time will tell.

Driven by this place for years and it is always too busy to stop . . . today . . . not many cars, so I thought I would take a chance . . . I thought to myself before I got out of the car . . . either this place has gotten really bad . . . due the lack of cars . . . OR . . . It is my lucky day.  IT WAS MY LUCKY DAY  Service was great . . . my waitress recommended the meatloaf sandwich special . . . and I was skeptical . . . meatloaf with grilled onions and barbeque sauce on grilled sour dough . . . I died and went to heaven . . . Fries were hot crispy and great with the barbeque sauce that oozed out of the sandwich.  Not only was this place a strong 5 stars . . . but it was a 7 napkin sandwich . . . I will definitely be back . . .

CUSTARD ONLY ! ! !  On my way home from work, I decided that I needed something cold and sweet . . . and so I decided to stop by Culvers for a custard.  Ordered the daily special . . . today's was Turtle Cheesecake (two scoops on a waffle cone) . . . OMG . . . it was out of this world.  Here was my dilema . . . I'm now finished . . . I'm still not quite half way home . . . do I go back for another . . . Home won . . . but I will be back.  There is only one problem with the Daily special custards . . . if they have a mix in them, like pieces of cheese cake, nuts, or fresh fruit . . . they are mosly on the top of the custard and not throughout . . . so when you get to the bottom of the cone, you ussually only have the base custard . . . still great . . . but sometimes you still want the extras.

Where do I start . . . the interior decor is nowhere close to a Beach House . . . the bartender if you want to call her that . . . looked like a stripper who had a rough night . . . her dress barely covered her backside cheek or her front side . . . and when she came to take our order, she stare us like a deer in the headlights, and had to have us repeat the order three times.  Drinks came . . . A Tap beer with 1/3 foam . . . while head is good . . . not on my beer . . . the Vodka and Seven . . . 3/4 Vodka / 1/4 WATER . . . REALLY . . . are you kidding me . . . the place would have gotten a zero . . . but when we went to pay . . . she said they were on her since we were so nice.  Not a place that I will be returning to . . .

Happened to include this bar on my last trip to Las Vegas - The Second Annual Dive Bar Tour . . . and at the time did not know it was a gay bar . . . but it turned out to be a really good dive bar.  We were there for happy hour and got the $5.00 all you could drink Pabst from 1 to 4 . . . just glad we did not stay the whole three hours . . . it would have been scary.  The bartender told us about the duct taped mirror and booths . . . I would have loved to see that . . . car hits outside of building . . . and a bunch of queens running around like divas after it rocked their world . . . hee / hee / hee . . . I'm still giggling with the image in my head.  Reason for the loosing a star . . . the choice of music . . . Sound of Music songs . . . are you kidding me . . . one might be okay . . . but four.  Anyways . . . this place does make my return list.

Been wanting to try this place ever since I saw it on "Check Please" . . . and today I finally got the chance.  Started with the Green Chili Chowder . . . Nicely seasoned, perfect chili taste, and not too thick . . . a great start to the meal.  Up next, the Crab Cake Bites . . . Loads of crab, nice and moist inside with a great crunchy outside . . . the perfect appetizer.  Main course, the Cuban Sandwich . . . Thought I died and went to heaven . . . the cibatta roll was fresh and soft, the meat melted in you mouth, and the seasoning was perfect.  Service was great, price was reasonable . . . and yes . . . this place is definately on my return trip list.

Took a client out for Breakfast this morning and ended up here at U.S. Egg.  Even though I work right around the corner . . . I have never had the experience of stopping in for Breakfast.  I was very glad that I did . . . and more importantly . . . the client was very happy also.  I had the protein waffle with a side of bacon and orange juice.  The protein waffle was hot and crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside . . . while the bacon was nice and hot and also crispy.  We were served quickly and  finished before we finished our meeting . . . but still lmanaged to sit at the table and finish our meeting without feeling like they were trying to rush us out.  Will definitely be back.

After the drive up from Phoenix for March Madness . . . I decided to stop for lunch before heading to the hotel . . . and I am glad I did.  Though this place is located in a seeder part of Las Vegas . . . I was surprized at how clean it was both inside and outside . . . and how friendly the staff was.  I ordered a double cheese burger, chili cheese fries, and a medium coke . . . the soda was your typical self-service soda bar with free refills . . . the chili cheese fries were hot and crispy, but I would have preferred a something other a cheese slice for the cheese . . . the burger was very tasty, but the beef patties were overdone and dry.  My biggest surprize was the chili . . . it had a great flavor and had just the right amount of spices that it did not over-power the rest of the meal.  Will I be back . . . YES . . . but not this trip . . . too many other spots to check out and try this trip.

After a long night of drinking in Las Vegas . . . I did not feel so great in the morning . . . so before our dive bar trek began . . . we decided to get some juice into us . . . and what better than some tropical drinks . . . so off to Frankie's Tiki Room we went.  Spoiler Alert  -  If you happen to enter during daylight hours . . . stop immediately upon entering . . . DO NOT keep walking and run into the BIG tiki carving.  After about a minute the eyes adjusted and we found our way to bar . . . order a Malekula . . . and that was just what I needed to clear the head and get ready for the day ahead . . . OOPS . . . it was so good . . . I had 3.  The place was great . . . the Tropical Theme . . . the great service . . . and I must be ammune to smoke, or it was just becasue it was earlly in the day, but I did not smell anything.  I will be back . . . not sure if it will be this trip with so many dive bars yet to hit . . . but some day, some how, I will be back.

Took the Wife this visit . . . and yes . . . I was kind enough to hold the door open long enough for her to not run head first into the Tiki God.  Had almost as much fun this time as last . . . wife is not a big RUM drinker, but she found one she liked . . . and I stayed with my Malekulas.  Finish with a Bender Ender . . . OOPS this turned out to be a Bender Starter.  Best part was that I e-mailed the owner before we went and got an Autographed copy of two of his books . . . Blue Vegas and Vegas Knockout . . . Thanks MOSS.  Will definitely be back again on the next Vegas trip.

Finally . . . back in Las Vegas . . . and this time . . . a night time visit to Frankie's Tiki Room.  This place is off the hook at night . . . a packed house . . . with hipsters . . . tourist . . . regulars . . . and all here for one reason . . . to sample and drink the outrageous, tasty libations prepared by one of Frankie's great bartenders.  Another place that I wish was closer to home . . . okay . . . maybe not . . . but only because I would be here every night . . . enjoying the great drinks.  See you next trip . . .

I make it a point to stop in at least once when I am in Las Vegas . . . since we frequent the Golden Nugget.  And up until this visit . . . I would say a solid four star establishment . . . this time . . . I was so disappointed that I only stopped in once.  The sushi . . . thought presented well . . . seemed to lack the flavors that I have gotten in the past . . . and in the crap and lobster rolls . . . we found pieces of shell.  We also ordered a hot plate this trip . . . the teriyaki chicken . . . and the sauce was like water and lacked any teriyaki flavor.  Will I be back . . . not sure . . . I know I will return to the Golden Nugget . . . but only time will tell if I return for sushi.

Stopped by for lunch with a couple of co-workers coming back from a meeting.  Were seating almost immediately as we entered the restaurant, and our waitress took our drink order just as quickly.  She returned with our drinks and took our order.  I ordered off the January Specials menu and selected the Laoded Chili Potato Skillet.  This also included two eggs (I had them over hard), and toast (rye toast for me).  The food came out quickly and was hot and delicious.  While this was not my first time here, I always attempted to try something different from the menu.  I have never been disappointed.

Recently bought a pre-owned 1998 BMW 740i . . . and since I wasn't exactly sure when the previous owner bought tires or had them rotated . . . I decided to have Discount Tire take a look.  Though I have been to this Discount Tire location before . . . I have yet to buy any tires, since the need has not arisen . . . have been rotating vehicle before they need tires.  With that said . . . they looked at the tire and informaed me that they still have about 70% of the tread life yet . . . they rotated the tires . . . it still did not cost me a dime.  When I arrived I was told it would be about 90 minutes . . . the wait was only 75 minutes . . . which was just perfect . . . because I had just finished reading the owner's manual.  Hopefully this time . . . I will own this vehicle long enough to have to purchase a set of tire from them.

Well, had to make the trip for my son's birthday . . . I was hoping for something more upscale . . . but it is always the birthday boy's choice.  Had a short wait . . . expected but not unusual . . . problem . . . four groups that arrived after us of the same size got seated before us . . . and even though we asked for a table (which all four of them got) . . . they wanted to squeeze me, a 400 pound man,  into a booth . . . NOT happening.  Table finally located . . . time to order.  Thought I'd try something different that my usual . . . The BLTA Croissant . . . B is for BACON . . . where is the bacon . . . one slice, are you kidding me.  Steak Fries . . . COLD . . . Iced Tea  . . . CLOUDY . . . Desert . . . didn't want to chance it.  The only reason that I am giving them two stars . . . the server tried her best to take care of us and right the kitchen's wrongs . . . oh well . . . I won't have to return for a year . . . unless . . . I can convince my son to go somewhere else next year . . .

Oh my god . . . I died and went to heaven . . . okay not heaven . . . the whiskey attic . . . over 1400 different kinds of whiskey.  The bar itself was a little bright for my liking . . . but the tap beer selection was great . . . and did I mention the whiskey attic . . . oh yeah, I did.  The bar food was typical . . . but made right in front of you . . . and did I mention the whiskey attic . . . oh yeah, I did.  Definitely on the "I'll be Back List" . . . and did I mention the whiskey attic . . . oh yeah, I did.

As in all of my fast food reviews - I can not give 5 stars to fst food chain.  Haven't been to this restaurant in a long time due to very slow service, luke warm food, and bad attitude from the work staff . . . but I thought I would give it anouther try today . . . and guess what something changed.  With that said, todays quick breakfast on the go was very nice.  The order at the drive through was taken promptly, and I was greeted with a smile at the window . . . after a short wait my food arrived hot and fresh.  Extreme Sausage Sandwich . . . Hot and Tasty Hash Browns . . . Hot and Crispy  Needless to say . . . for what ever reason . . . This Jack in the Box has stepped up it's game . . . at least for breakfast.

Heard about this restaurant from a friend and decided to take a co-worker who is relocating to another office out of town.  And I am glad I chose this place.  The service was a little slow out of the gate, hence the 4 star rating, but got better as the meal progressed.  I order a fresh brewed Iced Tea . . . it was fresh, clear, with a hint of island fruits.  For my lunch I ordered the Calamari Sandwich with the Hawaiian Mac and Cheese for my side.  The sandwich was perfect . . . the calamari was grilled perfectly and the sauce and greens were just right . . . while the Hawaiian Mac and Cheese was good . . . I would have loved to see a little more pineapple to give a litter sweeter taste.  Overall a very enjoyable lunch . . . the only bad part was that I will now only be communicating with my co-worker over the internet . . . but because of this . . . I found another nice restaurant.

A friend of mine suggested we go here for lunch . . . haven't been here since it first opened . . . and was hoping it was still as good as it was then.  WRONG  First, we got seated right away . . . and though it was not busy . . . it took another almost 10 minutes before our waiter came to take our drink order.  Iced Tea for me and a Coke for my friend . . . drinks came and there must be an ice shortage. and a fizz shortage (CO2) . . . however, there were plenty of cloudiness in my tea, and not even the lemon could help the taste.  While waiting for the entrees . . . our waiter brought us some kind of biscuit . . . a nice touch . . . had they not been burnt . . . OK . . . only three of the four were burnt.  Entrée time . . . cold Buffalo Chicken Sliders and luke warm French Fries . . . just the way I ordered it . . . NOT.  What has happened to my good old restaurant . . . the service has dropped and the food quality has all but disappeared.  Will I return . . . most likely not . . . but according to my friend . . . it is still one of his favorites . . . I guess if I come again . . . I'm going to order what he does . . .

Okay . . . I'll be honest . . . almost missed this place . . . it is tucked in between businesses that had I not looked at the right time I would have missed it.  Upon entering . . . I was greeted promptly . . . and chose to seat at the small bar as to not take up a whole table for my party of one.  I asked the waitress what she would recommend . . . and she point out a few choices that were diners favorites . . . and I forgot to mention were featured on Triple D.  And sure enough after she told me that . . . I noticed the picture of Guy on the wall.  Anyways . . . I ordered the crab cake and a fried oyster po-boy . . . the crab cake was full of crab and had this great sauce the was so tasty that I finished the bed of green the cake was sitting on since it was covered with this delightful sauce . . . the po-boy was also very good, crispy oysters a nice roll and again a wonderful sauce.  To say  I am now a fan would be an understatement . . . I made reservations for tomorrow . . . this place could not wait for a return trip to Las Vegas.

Today's experience at this grocery store was not a good one.  Found everything that I had come for, and did it in record time . . . now the issues.  First, the aisle that I chose to check was having card reader issues . . . finally after about 50 card swipes the reader finally accepted my card . . . this was a good thing because I did not have any cash on me.  Second, now there still sit my groceries . . . unbagged.  This is not the first time this has happened, but with no other grocery stores close . . . it is my only choice.  Holpefully, they will get these issues fixed . . . I miss the old Fry's Marketplace with the greeter, the friendly service, and no issues . . .

EXTERIOR WASH ONLY  I have been coming here for a while now . . . and while I am not a weekly user . . . I come when the exterior of my vechicles are dirty and dusty.  Which after the last couple of high wind days had left my vehicle filthy.  First, at only $5.00, the exterior wash only is a great value.  Second, when you are getting the exterior wash only, they let you get out of line and zoom right to the wash area.  Third, even at the cheap cost, they still wipe down the vechicle.  I don't know when I will be back . . . depends upon the dirtiness of my vehicles . . . but I will definitely be back.

PARTS DEPARTMENT ONLY ! ! !  The story begins about 6 weeks ago when I purchased a 1998 BMW 740I from a private party.  Knowing it was a used car that was 14 years old, I knew there would be issues . . . however . . . most appeared to be cosmetic / routine maintenance in nature, so I decided to use a mechanical friend I know, hoping to keep the cost down.  With that said here is the laundry list of items repaired and or replaced.  Passenger Side Mirror Cover Drivers Side Fog Light 3 Pieces of Miscellaneous Trim Passenger Side Front Grille Passenger Side Hood Stop with Actuator Emergency Brake Release Lever Rear Brake Pads with Computer Sensor Oil Filter Reseviour Mounts All Power Steering Hoses  Sounds like a large laundry list, but the Parts Department had most in stock and those that weren't they had in a couple of days.  They were very helpful, by showing me and giving me diagrams of the areas that needed attention, and my personal mechanic / friend, was able to let me know what exactly I needed.  Everything has been installed, and the 1998 BMW 740I is ready for it first road trip - Las Vegas for March Madness.

PHARMACY ONLY  Took one of my sons to an urgent care for a bronchial infections . . . which in turn required three prescriptions . . . dropped them off and was told it would take about an hour . . . told them I would wait.  After about 45 minutes, I noticed customers who dropped of prescriptions after me were starting to pick up their prescriptions . . . so I got in line to see how my sons were coming along . . . Was told they would bump it up to the front and should only be a couple of minutes more.  Another 45 minutes . . . another 6 count them 6 customers who dropped of new prescriptions pick theirs up . . . back to the window . . . was told it shouldn't be long . . . so back to the bench . . . another 30 minutes and a customer drops off his prescription and walks right to the pick-up window and get his prescription . . . I am ready to explode.  Back to the pick-up window . . . and the pharmacist was just finishing the third prescription . . . 2 HOURS . . . ARE YOU KIDDIG ME . . .  Will I be back . . . well not for at least 6 months . . . I have been band for making a scene . . . Walgreens here I come.

Well, I thought I had been to some GREAT Stekhouses in the Phoenix area . . . boy was I wrong . . . this place puts them all to shame . . . from the atmosphere, to the service, to the food . . . I don't think it can get better.  We started by telling the Sommelier that we were looking for a good reisling . . . while he had three specials for the night . . . he actully recommened the lower priced one . . . and he was spot on . . . it was unbelievable.  Knowing we were going to be having desert . . . we did not opt for an appetizer . . . my wife had the wedge salad, and I the lobster bisque . . . both were very very good.  The main course . . . the 16 oz. prime ribeye eith augrautin potatoes and wild mushrooms . . . the steak melted in your mouth . . . the potatos very cheesy . . . and the mushrooms very tasty.  And finally desert . . . wife had the creme brule, and I the croisant bread pudding . . . I thought I had died to and gone to heaven . . . my wife, I thought she was going to move into the kitchen and live on creme brule for the rest of her life.  Pricey yes . . . but it is definitely worth a stop once a Vegas Trip . . . WE SHALL RETURN . . . .

Hed been putting off this day for years now . . . with a name like "Smash Burger" I was expecting a thin dried out burger . . . boy was I wrong.  Had the mushroom and swiss smash burger and it was hot, juicy and oozing with flavor . . . a 6 napkin burger . . . the only thing better would be if I could make it a double . . . them I would be in hamburger heaven.  Now you may ask . . . if it was so great . . . why only four stars.  Well, the friers were being serviced so no "Smash Fries" that I had heard about.  But if the burger alone get this place four stars . . . I would be willing to bett the fries would push it up to five stars.  I return trip is definitely in the near future . . .

Knowing I was going to be in Scottsdale today around lunch . . . I decided to find something different for lunch . . . and The Herb Box looked like it would . . . and it did not disappoint.  We first ordered our drinks and the Crisp Falafel Bites . . . they were to die for . . . crisp and warm . . . with herb roasted tomatoes and a variety of olives . . . to be honest . . . I could have eaten the whole order myself . . . and the passion fruit black iced tea . . . clear crisp and cold . . . the perfect pair.  For my entrée . . . the butternut squash corn enchiladas . . . it came with a roasted tomato verde salad . . . which perfectly offset the richness of the enchiladas.  They were warm and the corn mixed with the butternut squash wrapped in a corn tortilla . . . was so rich and creamy and delightfully packed with flavors.  The atmosphere was relaxing . . . so much so . . . that I almost forgot that it was a work day . . . I will definitely be back . . . and I might even surprise my wife, and bring her back here for dinner.

On our dive bar tour of Las Vegas . . . we decided to stop in for lunch.  NO this was not one of our dive bars . . . and FAR from it . . . but we need to some food.  Place was not too busy, but we grabbed a couple of the remaining stools at the bar . . . went back to days of old and grapped a Pabst Blue Ribbon tap . . . and ordered a 10" PMS Pizza (okay not on the menu that way . . . Pepperoni, mushroom, and sausage) . . . food came quickly and was very good.  This place really rocks inside and will definitely need to come back some time at night to catch a show . . . Another place to add to my list of must revisit on future trips to Las Vegas.

Had a hankering today for a good old juicy, sloppy, messy, cheese burger today . . . and I found heaven . . . or at least as close as I can get here on earth.  This place was a 10 . . . that right TEN napkin burger joint . . . the bestest, most unhealthiest burger . . . but sometime that is what you need and crave.  Anyways, I digress . . . I ordered a hamburger on sour dough with swiss cheese . . . only 3 toppings - mushrooms, sauteed onions, and green chilis . . . and only 1 sauce - Sunshine sauce.  For my side . . . I ordered the handmade onion rings.  The bread was grilled and nice and crunchy . . . while the inside oozed gooey greatness . . . while the onion rings weer crispy with a nice sweet taste.  Loved the interior, though it is kinda small . . . but it did take me back to the small beach side joints in San Diego.  A definate return is in the future.

Was out touring some existing project site with a client, and a fellow co-worker suggested we stop in at Zipps for lunch . . . well I have been on this 28 day metablolism boost / energy incresing food plan from my trainer for the past three weeks, so I was alittle worried about going to a sports bar for lunch.  What a pleasant surprise . . . I was able to have the club salad with the dressing on the side, and it fit into the food plan perfectly . . . not to mention that the lettuce was cool and crisp, the bacon was thick with a crisp out side and tender inside, and the amount of other topping to lettuce was perfectly balanced.  The others in the party all had different burgers, and loved them . . . yes the drool was starting . . . especially for the Mushroom Swiss Burger . . . but that will have to wait for another visit . . . damn.  Now, why only four stars if everything was perfect . . . being on the food plan for almost a month had me wondering if it was the lack of restaurant food or if it really was that good . . . I'm betting the latter . . . but I need to come back for that Mushroom Swiss Burger befor I can give this place five stars . . .  Zipps . . . see you again soon . . . only one more week to go.

Needed to get out of the office . . . so I decided to give this place a try for lunch . . . and I was glad I did.  I ordered the Italian Lover and mad it a meal with Red Potato Salad and a Drink.  The sandwich was wonderful . . . although, I seem to burp red onions the rest of the day . . . not a bad thing, since it reminded me how good the sandwich was.  The potato salad was good . . . the portion was way too small for a side though . . . and I never, ever tell anyone how to cook . . . but if they added some dill to the potato salad it would be to die for.  The reason for only 4 stars . . . the size of the side and drink to make it a meal was in my mind way too expensive and too small.  But to be honest . . . I will definately be back . . . and I will probaly make it a meal . . . just with a different side.

Have been here a handful of time before . . . and the last time swore I would not be back . . . but my wife convinced me to give it a try again, now that there are other restaurants in the area and they have weeded out the employees.  I was pleasantly surprized . . . we were greeted by the manage within a minute and take right to a table.  The server came quickly and took our drink order and gave us time to look at the menu before taking our order.  The food came out quickly . . . was hot . . . and the server checked back numerous times to see how we were doing.  I had the "All You Can Eat Pancakes" and my wife had the "Grand Slam" . . . pancakes were hot and fluffy and everything was done to my wife's liking on her meal.  I can't tell you that Denny's will rival a 5 star restaurant . . . but I can tell you that this Dennys has greatly improved from it's first opening.  With all now considered . . . I will be back . . .

First the reason for the loss of the star . . . we asked for a table . . . they hostess tried to fit me (a still large man) into a both . . . and we were told there were no tables available . . . even though three were in plain sight . . . with that we opted for the bar.  Food was great . . . had the mushroom swiss burger . . . missed the part about it being a poung of ground beef . . . put like a trooper . . . I ate the whole thing . . . but not the side.  This burger was great in a taste way . . . not the oowee gooyee way . . . but pure tast way.  Service was great . . . cocktails were very tasty . . . we will devfinitelly be back . . .

Thought I would give this place a try since I have driven by numerous times . . . a mistake . . . definitely not what I would call a good restaurant.  First . . . the place is small and very cramped . . . second . . . the food was not really that good . . . third . . . the service was adequate.  I ordered the breakfast enchiladas . . . the tortillas tasted raw, the potatoes tasted like over cooked cubed baked potatoes . . . And . . . my plate had a big chip out of it.  Most likely will not return . . .

I will premise this review by noting that there were only 2 other people in the place when I arrived.  And that is the only reason that I did not give it 5 stars, becasue I would like to see how everything is when they are busier.  With that said, I ordered the Ultimate Grilled Cheese and an Iced Tea.  The bartender talked me into adding ham to the sandwich, and informed me that this sandwich came with a cup of Tomato Bisque Soup.  Ordered placed and in about 7 minutes my food arrived.  The Tomato Bisque Soup was out of this world, I could have eaten just that for a meal.  But, I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't, the Ultimate Grilled Cheese with Ham was also very, very good.  I would say that I will definitely order this again, but I can't say that because the rest of the menu has me wanting to try other items.  Overall, this was a great experience . . . and . . . I will definately be returning.

Always have a hard time giving a fast food restaurant 5 stars, so 4 is tops when it comes to fast food.  Been here a number of times for breakfast on my way to work, and the food has always been hot and fresh.  Today was a sausage biscuit, hashbrown and a small coke.  The biscuit had a nice crisp out shell with a soft fluffy inside, the sausage was hot, and the hasbround was hot and crispy.  This is really my go to breakfast place when I am running late and need something hot, fresh, and quick.

After a meeting this morning decided to stop for lunch on the way back to the office . . . and decided to look for something in the area.  Found a Chipolte restaurant on the the southeast corner of McDowell and 7th Avenue . . . hadn't been in the area in a while, and was I surprized to see all the new business.  First the food . . . Had a Chicken Burrito Bowl with rice, corn, cheese, lettuce, and hot salsa . . . full of flavor and the perfect size for lunch.  Also had some chips . . . they tasted fresh and wre nice and crispy.  The lunch was a good four plus stars, but the astmosphere and vibe will all the restaurants in this little area definately pushed it up to five stars . . . can't wait to go back and try out one of the other restaurants in the area.

Got a craving for Chinese Food this morning . . . new job, new location . . . hence . . . look for something close that I can get to and get back within the lunch hour . . . chose . . . King Wong.  From the outside . . . it is definately not a place i would stop at on a whim . . . but  . . . I have committed . . . SURPRIZE . . . the food was really, really good.  While the interior decor was nothing to really talk about . . . but the food . . . it was suprizingly good.  Had the Mongollian Beef Lunch Special . . . Egg Drop Soup, Egg Roll, Crab Puff, Fried Rice, and the main dish the Mongollian Beef.  As always . . . the main question . . . Will I be back . . . most definately . . . I think I found a new go to lunch restaurant.

Well I am an Indian Cuisine Virgin no longer . . . and . . . I am now an Indian Cuisine Fan.  A co-worker has been after me for some time to try indian cuisine, but I always had an excuse.  Well, today, she cornered me and said we are going . . . only concession . . . I got to choose the restaurant.  Chutney's Indian Cuisine it is.  I am so glad that this restaurant has a llunch buffet, because I had no idea what I would have ordered.  So I tried a little of everything . . . and . . . I loved it ALL.  The chicken, the goat, the eggplant, the curries, I could not get enough.  All were fresh, hot, and just enough spice to give everything a nice kick.  I think I may have made a mistake tough . . . while I am now willing to go out for indian cuisine . . . I hope the bar was not set to high.  Chutney"s I will be back . . . and for the rest of the Indian Cuisine Restaurants . . . look out, I will be coming your way soon.

Last day of class for my son in college, so I told him I would take him out for breakfast . . . we have been driving by this place all sememster and decided to try it . . . and was very glad that we did.  I ordered the House Fritatta and a Four Berry Smoothie . . . but was informed that the Four berry Smoothie was out of season.  Well, if that is the case . . . take it off the menu.  So I had a Strawberry Banana Smoothie . . . and that is why the lost a star.  The House Fritata was unbelievable . . . hot and full of flavor . . . The Strawberry Banana Smoothie was pretty good also . . . but I would bet . . . not as good as the Four Berry Smoothie.  Definately a place I will be stopping back at . . .

Been coming to this restaurant weekly for the last four or five months, and decided it was finally time to write a review.  The service and friendliness of the employees is truly unbelievable . . . it is like walking into "Cheers" . . . Welcome to Papa Murphy's . . . and then "Hi Michael".  We had the De Lite Cheese Pizza and a fresh Garden Salad, and as usual it was wonderful.  We will definitely be back again . . .

Decided to take my wife and family out to one of the newest restaurants in San Tan Valley.  We were seating  fairly quickly, and our waiter came and took our drink order.  When he returned with our drinks he took our food order, which included so appetizers as well.  Both appetizers, potato skins and load steak fries, were still cold in the middle and the cheese on top did not even melt.  Tried to send them back, the returned food was now burnt and way too crispy.  My wife's patty melt came out wrong and burnt as well, she sent it back and the returned one was acceptable.  My wings were okay, but way too greasy for my liking.  The worst part of the evening is when the manager came to check on us and ask us everything was.  My wife responded "not very good", and the manager said "well that's good" and walked away.  Will definitely not be returning.

This is a great addition to downtown Las Vegas that I really, really liked.  Across the street on the back side of Container Park it is ideal located.  The interior décor was great . . . from the paintings, to the wall art, to the hanging guitars . . . it was a pleasant change from normal.  I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and poached eggs . . . which were amazing . . . the beef, potatoes, and peppers were cooked perfectly . . . and the contract off the poached eggs, made this dish a true delight.  The service was a little slower than I would have like . . . and that was the reason for the deduction on one star . . . but this place could very easily be a five star.

What can I say . . . but this place ROCKS . . . Went for lunch with a co-worker after we decided we wanted a healthy lunch.  For being healthy . . . it sure was good.  First . . . we were greeted as soon as we walk in the door and taken to a table . . . our waitress followed shortly and took our drink order, and asked if we had any questions about the menu.  She returned with our drinks and look our order after explaining the different pizza crust.  Second . . . the salad arrived . . . I ordered the Greeek Salad and I was perfect . . . about three quarters of the way through my salad the pizza arrived . . . Nonna's Favorite . . . perfectly timed . . . first bite . . . wishing I had now ordered a larger pizza . . . it was out of this world . . . and who knew that a gluten-free crust would be so tasty.  I will definately be back . . . after all . . . I have 44 co-workers . . . and if I bring them one at a time . . . that means . . . at least 43 more trips . . . YEAH.

A friend of mine thought it would be good to take me to lunch since I've been busy looking for a job . . . and he suggested this place . . . which I have driven by many times but never stopped.  Had the "Chef Boy R We Burger" ad fries . . . the burger was very tasty, but a little over cooked . . . I like a juicy burger, and this was more well done . . . the beer was nice and cold . . . and the fries could have been crispier.  Definitely a place a will return too.

First night of my yearly March Madness trip to Las Vegas I like to go out for a nice dinner . . . tonight's was GREAT.  Started with a cocktail from the bar . . . the Midnight Stranger . . . and it  was unbelievable . . . already a bourbon fan, but this took me to another level.  For my appetizer I decided on the Grilled Octopus . . . the octopus was grilled perfectly . . . but the sauce really brought out the flavor and my it unbelievable.  For my entrée I selected the Sea Bass with a side of brussel sprouts . . . cooked to perfection and again, the layering of flavors from the sauce made this great.  I loved the atmosphere and the staff . . . and this place is definitely on the must try again list . . .

Never fails . . . on the trip up to Las Vegas the oil pressure / oil change light came on . . . so a quick search of YELP turned me on the this place . . . quick in / quick out / very reasonable price . . . happy and back to the casino we go.  If I ever have a problem on my way to Las Vegas again . . . Liberty Tech and Tire will definately be my first choice.

Okay . . . I'll be honest . . . have been wanting to "get in" to this place since it first popped up on my radar back in January . . . and decided that my mission on my next trip to Las Vegas was to get in here . . . anything else would be failure.  Well . . . after making my reservations the previous Sunday (was snuck in Thursday) . . . we decided to make our way over to the Commonwealth a little early for a beer prior to entering . . . shortly after finish out beer, we were snuck in.  This place was unbelievable . . . I can't tell you what I had . . . this was because I let our mixologist surprize me each time . . . any every drink was a unique experience . . . I loved them all.  The place was relatively busy . . . but watching the ninja mixologist move . . . hopping above the cash register . . . then onto the bar to grab a new bottle of liquor . . . and never missing a beat . . . keeping us entertained the entire stay.  The only bad part . . . the evening came to an end . . . until the next time I'm in Las Vegas . . . I will only be able to dream about the wonderful time at The Laundry Room.

What can I say . . . other than . . . vegas doesn't get any better than this.  I thought I loved this place after my first time here.  But it only go bettter . . . of course this time I brought the wife with . . . and needless to say . . . she thought this place was off the charts . . . I had to explain yelp and that 5 stars was the maximum . . . not 12 . . . she thought it was better than a ten.  This time though . . . I can honestly tell you two of the drinks I had "A Paper Airplane" and of course the James Bond in me had to have "A Lady Vesper" . . . again . . . I give the mixologist full reign . . . I'm betting that in just a couple of more trips, I willl have everything on the drink list once.  In three visits and 18 drinks later . . . not one repeat . . . the mixologist has and unbelievable memory.  I might even try to sneak back one more time before we head back home . . . after all . . . it was the perfect  beginning to this Vegas trip . . . why not make the perfect ending . . .

On my last trip here . . . they were training a new mixologist . . . since that time . . . a couple of friends have visited and gave me mixed reviews on the new mixologist . . . well . . . even though I miss the old mixologist, the new one is doing just fine . . . another five star visit.  While the new mixologist may not have the flare or passion of the old mixologist . . . he can definitely create a great cocktail.  And as always when I visit my favorite place in all of Las Vegas . . . I can't tell you what I had to drink . . . because . . . I let the mixologist create my night and take me on a trip through the many cocktails on their menu.  And this trip . . . was an eight stop trip . . . and what a great ride . . . another perfect ending to another trip to Las Vegas . . . see you all the next trip . . .

A co-worker of mine sent me a link to this restaurants website, and since she knows that I am trying to eat more "healthy", recommended this place as a healthy alternative for lunch.  So after about a week and half of hemming and hawing, I finally decided to give the place a try.  I ordered a regular raspberry, pecan bowl, with pea protein, whey protein, and extra granola . . . won't lie . . . thought it was kinda pricey for what I ordered . . . over $10.00. Since the place is extremely small . . . three tables and a two seat bar counter inside, and two table outside . . . and with no place to sit, I got my order to go.  30 MINUTES LATER . . . My order finally was ready . . . definitely needs more than two people working and more seating if this place is going to be successful . . . even the UPS man who was delivering a package left after 10 minutes of not even being acknowledged.  Oh well . . . after a short trip back to the office, I sat down to enjoy my acia bowl . . . and I was pleasantly suprised . . . I was really, really good.  Very tasty, just the right balance of smoothness, crunchiness, and sweetness.  Will I be back . . . probably . . . but if all of the seating is taken, and / or there are people waiting in line to order . . . I will probably go somewhere else.

This place was great . . . it reminded my of some of the small pizza joints in New York City . . . and the pizza was pretty good as well.  We ordered the Radio City Meat Luvers Pizza . . . it had plenty of toppings . . . just the right amount of cheese . . . an a very tasty sauce.  The crust was crispy and also had a good taste.  I am torn though . . . with another great pizza place in the area . . . I may only make it down here when I come to Fremont East to drink . . . and that is not a bad thing . . . since that is usually a couple of times each Las Vegas Trip.  But definitely on my . . . I will be back list.

After consulting a friend on Yelp, decided that this would be the spot for my first dinner this trip to Las Vegas . . . he was right . . . this place has it all.  Started this the Crispy Brussel Sprout . . . the flavors and textures were unbelievable . . . I will never be able to eat plan brussel sprouts again.  For my Main Course I settled for the Hotateyaki . . . since I really wanted the Takorizo, but was informed that due to the popularity of this dish, they were presently out . . . anyways . . . the scallops were cooked perfectly, the sauce, and the fruit made my taste buds dance like they have never done before.  Desert was Ringo Lico . . . this mixure of sorbet, grapefruit, pistachios, and custard was a perfect ending to a wonderful evening.  My only concern . . . by the next time I get to Las Vegas . . . I will need to make reservations, because this hidden gem, will not stay hidden for long.

Met a couple of friends in Las Vegas for the weekend and they wanted to try this restaurant after listening to me rave about it last year . . . what can I say . . . another great experience.  This time however . . . we tried the sushi to start the meal . . . be had the blue fin tuna roll, sea urchin, and fresh water eel . . . all were unbelievable.  We also ordered the Crispy Brussel Sprout . . . and as last year . . . made this my favorite vegetable . . . again.  The main course for me was Niku Berry . . . the flavors . . . the presentation . . . man do I wish they had a restaurant like this near me.  For desert it was the Kamni-O . . . for a brief minute . . . I thought I was Elvis and died and went to heaven.  Another great dinner at Yonaka Modern Japanese . . . I will be back . . . again and again and again.

Been wanting to try this place for some time . . . so when a client of mine from Germany suggested this place . . . I jumped at the chance.  The interior was clean with a variety of seating options from high tops to tables to booths . . . we chose a table.  The waitress came quickly and took our drink order while we looked at the menus.  I decided on the Swedish Hash with sauerkraut, marinated green beans, and coleslaw.  The food came quickly and was delicious . . . the coleslaw though looked more like a garden salad . . . this time we decided to have desert and I ordered some kind of polish pudding . . . it was out of this world.  The only reason that I gave it four stars was due to the fact that the service was a little slower than I usually like . . . not sure if this was because I needed to get going to an afternoon meeting, or if it was because the place was busy . . . does it truly really matter . . . probably not . . . because I will definitely be back.

Over heard some people talking at a homeowner's meeting . . . and put this on my list to try . . . and am I glad I finally did . . . I have been looking for a good breakfast and lunch place out here on the east side . . . and I believe I have found it.  Just missed breakfast . . . but lunch worked for me . . . order one of the specials of the day, the open face barbeque cheese steak, with a side of roast red potato salad, and the peach unsweetened iced tea.  The food arrived a short time later . . . and I instantly started in on the potato salad . . . had to tell myself to stop though . . . otherwise I would have eaten it all before even trying the sandwich.  The sandwich was also very good . . . but that potato salad was off the hook . . . the only way I am ever going to get to try another one of there sides . . . will be to order it as an extra . . . but I am sure it will be worth it.  Will I be back . . . definitely . . . a little further out than most people would probably like . . . but definitely worth the trip.

Stopped in for a quick beer since my brother's plane was delayed an hour . . . and was pleasantly surprised . . . even though I was an out-of-towner, and everyone there appeared to just have gotten off work . . . I was treated like a local.  The bartender was attentive and kept track of my needs . . . even taking time to strike up a conversation.  The beer was super cold . . . super big . . . and cheap.  Good thing I had to go and get my brother . . . otherwise this could have been a really bad night . . . because those beers were going down way to easy.  Definitely on my shall return list . . . just that . . . next time I will spend a little more time here.

Pardon the pun . . . this place ROCKED . . . from the great décor . . . to the images on the walls . . . to the food.  We had the two pizzas a thin crust and the deep dish . . . while the deep dish was good . . . I preferred the thin crust.  After this place . . . I would never stop at another pizza joint in Las Vegas . . . I might even have to stop again before I leave this trip.

Had an early morning meeting on the far east side . . . so . . . instead of driving all the way into the office and back out . . . I decided to look for a place to have breakfast . . . and this is where I ended up.  Not busy . . . not busy at all . . . worry . . . why is this place so dead . . . concern . . . feeling better . . . greeted by my waitress . . . who took my drink order and provided me a menu . . . off to a good start.  I ordered the Breakfast Skillet . . . a short time later it arrived . . . and guess what . . . it was very tasty . . . hot . . . and all the components seemed to be cooked perfectly . . . and . . . they had rye toast . . . this place was actually really good.  My concern . . . this little gem needs more business . . . or I am afraid . . . like so may other mom and pop diners . . . it will disappear . . . so . . . while I like my hidden gems and like to keep them my secret . . . this one needs to have us get the word out . . . so that it does not become another statistic . . .  I will definitely be back

This place is a great place to start your morning . . . unless you are hung over and don't want to be greeted by the bright sunshine of morning . . . the floor to ceiling window bring in lots of sunshine and really make this place sparkle.  Oh the food . . . I had the "Kentucky Fried Chicken" with fresh, and I mean fresh squeezed orange juice . . . the food came quick and hot . . . the chicken was crispy and juicy . . . the hashbrowns were good, would have liked then a little crispier.  The only thing wrong . . . and it had nothing to do with the restaurant . . . the pay stations at the parking garage were not working . . . and it took an extra 45 minutes trying to get on with the rest of our day.  I will be back . . . I just need to find a different place to park.

A old friend had returned to town and so we decided to start up or tradition again of going to a different restaurant every six or eight weeks . . . and this time we chose Jewel's Bakery and Cafe . . . and this place truly is a hidden Jewel.  An eclectic little place with a small menu . . . and a great bakery selection.  I chose the Curry Chicken Salad Sandwich with Fries, an Iced Tea, and we split a Rocky Roads Brownie.  The sandwich was a flavor explosion in my mouth . . . the spices , , , the big chunks of chicken . . . the fries . . . hot and crispy . . . the brownie . . . well lets just say . . . I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  This is a hidden jewel that everyone should try at least once in their lifetime . . . but I know i willl try it again . . . and again . . . and again.

Take that HOA Weed Natzi's . . . I have finally found a landscape company that told me what they were going to do . . . when they were going to do it . . . and . . . .what it was going to cost.  Came home from work yesterday . . . and everything was done.  Looks better than it did when we moved in over 7 years ago . . . and the best part . . . they are going to be coming back every month to make sure it stays this way.  And the best part . . . the HOA WEED NATZI'S can now start picking on some else.

Another great establishment brought to us by the owners of the Commonwealth, Park on Fremont, and the Laundry Room . . . and while definitely different than the other three . . . this place has a vibe of it's own.  The trendy interior comes complete with a grand piano . . . unbelievable light cloud . . . and libations that were definitely inspired by the Laundry Room.  The windows . . . that were open on the night we were there . . . allowed for the music outside to fill this space with great sounds.  The drinks . . . and I have  no idea what I had (since I let the mixologist . . . surprise me) . . . were well balanced and great tasting.  I am not a Strip person . . . but this place is on my return list . . . so I guess . . . I will be seeing the Strip on my return trips.

Noticed this place was open the other day and thought I would give it a try . . . especially since I was in the mood for some Chinese food.  Being new . . . the place was clean . . . and unlike a lot of other restaurants . . . you can actually see the entire kitchen while they are preparing you food.  The food . . . I ordered of the lunch menu . . . I got mine to take out . . . and it was still hot and delicious when I got back to the office.  Here is my problem . . . and the reason they lost a star . . . if you dine in with the lunch menu, you get soup and fried won ton . . . if you get the meal to take out . . . no soup or won tons . . . I guess next time I will have to try dining in.  And yes . . . there will definitely be another trip . . .

Was out looking for a job and decided to treat myself to lunch . . . even though I am watching every penny . . . and decided to try a Food Truck . . . since I have wanted too for some time.  Well guess what . . . I happened to spot Rock-A-Belly in the parking lot of a local business in the area I was job searching.  Ordered the Chubby Checker and a Coke . . . The sandwich was off the hook . . . full of flavor, hot, and very tasty . . . and don't get me started on their signature chips . . . I could eat those things all day.  The only thing wrong was that the soda wasn't as cold as I usually like . . . but what can I expect for being the first customer o the day.  I will definitely be stopping back again . . . keep Rocking . . . Rock-A-Belly . . .

My office co-workers and I decided to take on of our own who was leaving out to lunch . . . and this place was suggested.  Been here many times before . . . when it had a different name and different owners . . . so I really did not know what to expect.  I was pleasently surprized . . . I ordered the Big Ass Burrito with Short Rib meat and an Iced Tea.  As some of you know I am a BIG guy . . . so I was expecting a BIG burrito . . . it was a good size, but not the biggest I have had . . . and though it was very tasty . . . the best bites had the Short Rib Meat . . . which this burrito could have used more of.   The Iced Tea tasted fresh brewed and was nice and clear.  I will definately be back to try more of the menu , , , and it is definatelly worth trying.

Finally . . . a Food Truck close to where I work . . . on a day that I wanting to go out and grab something quick for lunch.  Not one of my go to trucks . . . at least it wasn't . . . but is definately now.  Ordered the Braised Pork Tacos with Avocado . . . probably one of the most tasty tacos I have had in my lifetime.  Very personable owners . . . and definately on my WILL BE BACK list.  Don't know when . . . but since I follow on twitter . . . I will know when they are close.

I was a little skeptical of this type of matress at first . . . but after a trip to their showroom . . . and now sleeping on one for a couple of weeks now . . . I am sold.  Probably the best night sleep I have had in years . . . and even better . . . it works well with my Craftmatic adjustable bed.  It is like . . . being cradled in one big . . . cushiony hand.  My only problem . . . and most people will probably never experience it . . . is the climb up the stairs to the showroom.  I'm a big guy . . . the stairs are narrow . . . almost fire escape narrow . . . and of course . . . outside . . . and I am afraid of heights.  The probably should place 10 or 12 on the ground below to make me feel safer.  I would like to say that I will be back . . . but that probably won't be for 7 to 10 years  . . . or . . . if I give it to one of my kids . . . and then I would need another.

What can I say . . . went in last Friday because I had some severe knee pain . . . filled out the paper work . . . and waited 90 minutes before I was called back to see someone.  After the examination . . . I was given two shots, two prescriptions, and a referral for an MRI.  Still waiting for the MRI office to get authorization from my insurance company . . . and am now out of pills.  Called back to see if I could get the prescriptions refilled . . . and was told that I would have to come in and be seem again before they would refill the prescriptions.  No wonder everyone is fed up with the medical situation in this country . . . and NO . . . I will not be going back to this facility . . .
