Went to FEZ off of a quick yelp search and I couldn't have made a better decision!  Bottle of wine and an entree, they were delicious.  The service was great, made a reservation online, everything was super easy.  After dinner, headed to the bar had a couple of martini's; Bar service was good too.  Great food, great service, great company, what more could you ask for!

Simply put this place is AWESOME.  If you're looking to start a business or already own a business but need some of the details on a particular area, this is the place to be.  So far I've only attended a Brown bag lunch but I was thoroughly impressed by the people who were there. However, don't show up with out being ready to put in your two cents, its needed to keep the ball going, I thought it was really good.  I can't wait to go back!

Omg!! I can't believe how amazing the people are here, quick to get me my caffeine fix, and so, so nice. I was killed by kindness and I liked it. Still smiling as I'm driving down the road, iced double torture in hand. Thanks for making my morning extra awesome.

I had the smash fries and an Arizona burger both were really good. Luckily, I was able to sneak in before the lunch rush, there was a long line. I didn't like the paper lined wire mesh trays, I thought I was going to make a mess. All-in-all great good and atmosphere. Check it out!

This place is fabulous! Great food, friendly staff, and an awesome interior. My family has basically ordered everything off of the menu and nothing has come close to being disappointing.  You will NOT be let down, it was delicious.

Trashy, even for a dive bar. Service was terrible wish it was better. The only shining point was that the nacho's were good.
