I purchased a groupon for a one hour facial with Lisa.  She was very punctual and gave the whole hour facial (I've had groupons where they short your service).  The receptionist takes you back to a room in the spa where you wait which was nice and peaceful, but she was not...didn't catch her name but she had a little attitude like she didn't want to be there at all and was kind of rude on the phone as well. Anyways!    Most importantly, the facial was great, very relaxing.  She listened to my needs and did extractions where needed.  She gave a great face and arm massage and used some of my favorite professional products; repechage, skin ceuticals, and PCA.  I would definitely see Lisa again :)

I received a groupon as a last minute gift for a massage.  I wanted to upgrade to 90 minutes and I am so glad I did!   Ed was my therapist. He was above and beyond thorough to listen to my needs.  Was punctual and didn't short me on my massage like I've had happen at other places.  Very nice guy, knows his stuff... And makes his own massage cream with custom essential oils!  Such a cool bonus I didn't expect.  I will definitely be back and recommend them/him!

Panera bread ain't got shit on Paradise Bakery!!  I know there's a bunch of bums in the area but the bathrooms were on lockdown.   The cookies aren't buy one get one free. They don't have the best salad ever which is the southwest chicken Caesar!    I hope paradise bakery doesn't turn into this craphole!  Never going back

My favorite place!  I've been coming since the beginning of this year, 2015 and seeing great results.  I belong to la fitness still but joined the gym here and get a better workout than I ever have. They have a different routine every time I come, never gets boring but always pushes me hard enough.  I use the Herbalife program as well and it's nice to grab a shake after my workouts, with so many different flavor options.

Had a great experience with Heather.    Fast, painless, and efficient.  Very clean and nice facility :) looking forward to the new location opening soon north of Scottsdale road and the 101
