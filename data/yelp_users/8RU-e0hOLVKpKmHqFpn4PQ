Went to sand club first their system was down, they sent us to the verizon store, went in to get a phone for my daughter, got great service from a guy named Ricky martan. They stayed after for half an hour after they closed.i would highly recommend this store, it was definitely a five star visit.

I went in today to mail in a dish network box, didn't have tape for the box, at other stores they charged me 50 cents for tape, they didn't charge me and were very nice.

They are close to my house and are knowledgeable with what they sell. Some stuff us a little higher some stuff is about the same. They always have what I need that's what is important.

I love the food and the sushi is great always fresh. The special abalone soup is great also. I love the cucumber Philly roll and the tuna salad.

I saved $2000 a year on my business insurance. And the service is great,Crystal, Maria,and Sarah always come through fast when a client needs proof of insurance. I also have Home insurance, and auto insurance with Steve. He has been my agent for years. Best broker in town.

I love the place. the food is great. the service is about 80 percent. little slow but they make it to order. I have never seen a homeless person in there so maybe that is taken care of from the other ladys post.

I'm from Chicago and have eaten a lot of BBQ and being in the service I've had it From all over the country. These guys don't know BBQ. Avoid at all cost they are rude with bad food   I don't know where to tell you to go but not here.

Looking for somewhere to eat found ATL wings on yelp went there gave it a try they were great. I ordered 12 hot wings and they were smothered. Just the way I like him I hate it when people act like they're say to be in the sauce for someone else to thumbs up.

I had to get my truck mount fixed, I'm always what chemicals are before but today I need a truck mount fixed in a hurry. They knew I was desperate yet they still gave me a fair price. I would highly recommend them to anyone they're great guys honest. Michelle knows her stuff too
