I love Chipotle, but this location is just careless. I put in an order online to pickup in an hour and when I got there, it wasn't made. They simply forgot. The cashier even said, "oh, I don't know why it didn't go through" with no apology. To make things a worse experience, I found that they didn't include every ingredient I asked for in my order by the time I got home! They forgot 2 items and I didn't have the energy to go back to have it remade. I don't understand how my order was messed up with extra time even after they were already over an hour late with making it to begin with. I won't be eating at this particular Chipotle again.

I had a great experience with Justin last night! I had first visited RS Mattress across the street, but the associate there was impatient, not informative whatsoever, and was more focused on if I was ready to buy at that moment. I didn't even know what I wanted! So instead of being a cheap ass (also wanting help with my first mattress purchase) I walked to Mattress Firm and was warmly welcomed by the manager. I probably laid on 10 different beds, each of which he thoroughly explained the materials used, benefits of the type of mattress, etc. He was even able to work with my budget. I didn't even know what time the store closed, and although it's company policy (most of the time) to stay as long as a customer is inside the store, he didn't rush me or the transaction. We had an enjoyable conversation throughout my decision making process :) I would recommend Mattress Firm because of Justin, they have a great employee for this company! Thanks again!!

My initial review was taken down because it was deemed a "personal attack". Although I don't agree, people should still be able to read my experience. So here it is again, but edited for content: This is the worst customer service experience I've had at any restaurant, locally owned or chain. Actually, at a chain this would never happen. Let me explain.. I went here yesterday morning (1/31/16) for breakfast with a girlfriend of mine to catch up. I ordered the Santa Fe Omelette and asked for no monterey jack cheese, no tortilla strips and sauce on the side instead of on top. Reasonable requests I've made before and am also sure others have made regardless if it concerned food allergies or plain preference. The waiter comes back with the "manager" because their computer doesn't input orders that way. The manager went over my order saying that I wanted the "designer omelette" with onions, tomatoes, and feta, hash browns and tortilla (similar to the Santa Fe I guess). I still wanted the sauce on the side which was the one item missing on my plate. Not a big deal, the waiter brought it out when I asked for it. And btw, it wasn't even sauce but more like salsa. This is where the problem occurred, we get the check and we were both charged more than what was priced on the menu. My omelette was priced at $8.95 and whatever she had put on the ticket said $10. I brought this up to our waiter and she brings the manager over again. The owner starts her sorry excuse of an explanation as to why it was charged like that "it's because we can't enter it in our system the way you asked for it and for substitutions we charge more, it's only a dollar". Excuse me?! How about I forego a dollar and say, hey it's just a dollar to you! Why don't you look up the word "substitution" because I asked for 2 items to be taken out of my omelette without replacing it with anything else! So I tell her, it's not just a dollar it needs to be the correct price. Just because you're too lazy to go in the kitchen to tell the chef what I asked for/your faulty system won't allow for custom changes doesn't mean I have to pay you another dollar. Think if she had said this to 500 other customers. That would be another $500 in her pocket for laziness. She tells me that she would take care of it because I had a problem and goes to fix our tab. Assuming the meal would be comped I put my card away. She comes back, takes my friend's card and says that she fixed hers and took $1 off of mine. So.. I'm still paying for that? Now we have to wait for this idiot to come back only to tell her that the check needs to be split. We tell her this only for her to say "can't you just give her the money you owe her?" and I respond with "are you serious?" with her saying "yeah, I'm serious". Why don't you start doing your job and void out the first tab you already messed up and follow protocol? Obviously I told her no. She said that she needed my card first to split the check and I asked to verify "so I'm paying $8.95 right?" She says "I'll get your check". Yeah, why don't you show me the new receipt before handing over my card? When she returns with my corrected receipt I held out my card and she snatched it from me! I spoke loudly saying "Don't snatch my card from my hand!"If you haven't noticed but I didn't mention her apologizing for anything because she hadn't and when she heard me she says "I'm in a hurry" and rushes in the back. Guess what, I was in a hurry too and I've been waiting for you to get me the right bill for the last 30 min! I asked her if she was the manager and she says "Yes, and the owner". So I tell her that I had a horrible experience here, specifically with her. And all she wants to say is that I'M the one being difficult?! Rule #1 in customer experience, the customer is always right! I know that's not always true, but she clearly did not GAF about how rude her interaction with us was. She goes on saying I should order what's on the menu and again, a substitution was made. 1- Don't tell your customers what to order 2- a substitution is a REPLACEMENT of one thing for another! She mentions that she overheard me curse in my conversation to my friend, a conversation that she was not a part of, therefore I have a "trashy mouth". Everyone curses, are you kidding me? Why don't you stop eavesdropping and apologize for the difficulty YOU put me through that morning? Her sense of entitlement shows that she's been treating customers however she wants for a long time. I'll be recommending people to NOT eat here. BTW, I filed a dispute with my bank and got my money back.

I love treating myself to Pei Wei every now and then so when I was done with a heavy workout, I ordered online to pick up on the way home. I ordered extra tofu and chicken for an additional $4 but when I got my food I was extremely disappointed. It was overfilled with rice rather than the extra tofu and chicken I requested, minimal sauce, and a couple pieces of the chicken were rubbery. It was kind of gross to get past what chicken I did have on my plate. It was a waste of money ordering "more" food when it was the same portion as if I didn't add the extras. To top it off, the staff was unfriendly. The cashier who handed me my food didn't offer utensils or soy sauce (granted, it was in front of the register but usually you'd think it would be pointed out since that's a new thing I guess) and didn't have the common courtesy to say "thanks/have a nice day". This location was a bust for me.

My sister and I were in Vegas this past weekend and wanted to have a nice meal the first night we were there. We felt like Italian so on to Yelp we went and found this cute spot! We went around 9pm and it wasn't very busy, the hostess was also friendly. There's a small "patio" with hedges outlining it and it also where we sat. The decor was nice and felt homey. The menu wasn't huge, but had a nice selection of pasta and pizzas. I ordered the carbonara and my sister ordered the eggplant parmesan. The carbonara was delicious! It really hit the spot because I was craving something richer so I'd be satiated for the late night we were about to have. The prosciutto was crispy and the noodles were perfectly al dente. The portion was just enough to not have leftovers or feel too full. Oh, and as you've probably read in majority of reviews, their complimentary garlic knots were awesome! You can't have Italian food without garlic bread and these were the best I've had anywhere, they're packed with flavor! The price point was decent considering it was in The Venetian. BTW, you might miss this spot but it's on the way to the food court upstairs. It was a toss up between this place and Casanova which was across from it. I'd be happy to eat here again!

I am just letting you know that I just had someone come in my office to solicit a voucher for this salon and although I let him talk about it, as soon as I refused he snatched the voucher from my desk and walked out. Prior to that I said I would look into the salon but sadly I will not because I don't appreciate handling business that way. I don't have his name but he has an orange tan and black hair. If you know him you should probably tell him that not everyone says yes and acting rude only deters future business.

I just want to let you airheads know that I was in your store for a good 15-20 minutes trying on lipstick and none of you said hello or asked if I needed help. I left specifically because of this and didn't make a purchase even though that's the reason why I walked in. And no, it wasn't busy.

I had a seriously irritating and uncomfortable experience at this Dillard's yesterday*. I went Christmas shopping for boyfriend and wanted to get him dress shoes that are also comfortable. I am no shoe expert so I would expect a notable store like Dillard's to have knowledgable employees. I was greeted by a middle eastern guy about my age (mid 20's) who was passive aggressive about my budget. Yeah, I said some shoes he recommended are ugly and I was on a budget but don't rush me to choose a shoe when they're that expensive for me to just dole out hundreds of dollars for your sake. Then I told him I'd look around first just to see what the competitors are charging in the rest of the mall and asked him if he knew where then men's bathrobes were before I left. He told me they were upstairs to the left. I circled the whole upstairs and it was ALL WOMEN'S CLOTHING! Is this guy deaf? Annoyed, I left and sought out other shoes from several stores. Seeing that they were all in the same price range I headed back to Dillard's where this time, nobody was to be found. I circled that section for maybe 10 minutes before another customer and her mother showed up looking for shoes too. When I spoke to them they said they had come back from looking at other stuff since when they were looking at shoes earlier that nobody was there either. That dude must have been gone for over 30 minutes if that was the case. Another employee saw us and said he would get the guy that works in that department. I told the ladies that if it was the same one that "helped" me when I was there a couple hours prior I would talk to a manager. Surprise! Same unhelpful employee and it looked like he just woke up from a nap when he walked out from the back. He helped them first, which didn't really bother me, but when he spoke with me in the middle of their conversation he basically asked if I had decided already! Once more, I asked what shoes were built for comfort as well as dressy so when he pointed them out he could finish helping the other 2. I overheard some of their conversation and apparently, they didn't like his passive aggressive nature and started to scold him. I guess one of the women asked him to see if a shoe came in a different color so instead of going in the back to check he just said there wasn't. He began to defend himself without apologizing and at the same time tried to stifle the argument because it caused a different employee to walk over to see what the problem was. They were taken care of by the nicer of the 2 employees and left me stuck finishing my transaction with this guy. I had to get the shoe I selected in the right size to I could look but he automatically took it to the register. Ugh.. Can't I look at it one more time before you ring it up? I finally purchased the damn things and walked away relieved and frustrated as contradictory as that is. I came back a couple weeks later on my lunch break (I work in San Tan Village in one of the businesses above the stores) to discuss the issue with an actual manager. She knew immediately who I was referring to and explained that he's new and that she would let his department manager of the situation. By the tone of her voice I got that he's been a nuisance for a while.  I got nothing more than an apology which is ok. I just feel like the lack of quality customer service is something they care little to none nor are they concerned with customers experiences there.  P.S. This review was meant to be posted a week before Christmas*

I've been here twice now, the most recent was to see Marlon Wayans! I like where the theater is located, it's super convenient to other eateries and bars to keep you occupied before or after the show. It's also connected to Copper Blues which is another fun spot that has live music that can be enjoyed by the firepit in the foyer between the two. I arrived to the show about an hour early because it's first come-first serve basis and all of the VIP tickets were sold out. It was fortunate that there were still a few seats open right next to VIP seating too so I'm glad I didn't Have to fork over the extra cash. It pays to be early, people! The server was very nice and was extremely attentive at first. Drinks came out fast and made well! The only complaint I would have is that his service declined as the hoard of an audience filled up the tables. That's to be expected I suppose! We had to wait a while for our nachos but it was worth the wait :) The serving was ginormous, cheese melted just right, crispy chips, and loaded with chicken, guac, sour cream, and jalepenos - YUM! The place does get crowded wherever you sit so just come prepared and enjoy the show! BTW, Marlon was awesome (and the DJ that night)and seeing him live only made me a bigger fan!

This place has the best gelato I've had! It's also clean and has crisp wintery decor. Every flavor I've tried (unlimited samples!) has made it all the more difficult to decide what I want versus thinking what I thought I wanted before walking in. The staff is super friendly and knowledgable about the ingredients that go into the massive variety of gelato they serve. Each flavor has a custom carved fruit or whatever the main ingredient is as decor on top of the batch. I would recommend this place during hot or cold weather because you never know when you're experiencing a sweet and decadent craving! They also make milkshakes with your choice of gelato, smoothies, affogato, and fat-free sorbet (strawberries & champagne and blackberry cabernet are delicious). You can get a single or double scoop and they even have your everyday option to get a pint or bigger. Individual servings are topped with a mini pirouette which is a nice touch :)

I ordered the spicy chicken wrap because when I saw a photo posted on this yelp page (it's been removed) it looked appetizing. It was picked up with a bunch of orders placed with coworkers in my office. What I got instead was this open-faced pita that clearly was not wrapped. There was also a swirl of sriracha sauce on top of the aluminum foil it was wrapped in which wasn't wrapped nicely either. I called and was explained that the kitchen "makes it that way" because it's "big". I get it, but they decorate aluminum foil with sriracha sauce, really? I asked for the manager but they had to call me back because they were busy. They waited so long I couldn't answer anyway since I was off of my lunch hour. Thank goodness I was starving since I had no time to return this ugly mess they call a "wrap". Here are a few photos from what they advertise on their menu online vs. What I was given. This was a disservice to pita jungle and I wasn't happy at all with either my food or the person who answered the phone that tried explaining that slop.

I just moved down here from Scottsdale and my new job is down the street from this place. I happened to drive by while I went somewhere else for lunch and immediately stopped when I saw "boba"! I have yet to have one decent or satisfying boba drink in Arizona (I'm from Nor Cal which has the best!), but when I ordered the taro boba drink I was in heaven!! The employee working was by herself and was very sweet in helping me clarify if the boba was the chewy kind or the ones that burst. And since it was my first time in there, she gave me a free donut to sample, which was also delicious. If you're looking for a genuine boba, I would definitely recommend this place! It just became a little more dangerous now that I work around the corner... :)

I love this place! Their smoothies are delicious and I usually come in the morning on the way to work since I work in a business office above the shopping center. I've seen the same woman the multiple times I've come to get a drink and she's really friendly. I'm always able to adjust certain things in my smoothie without it being an issue. I love that their 1 size is big and decently price ($5 average) and especially since they have happy hour going on right now that's half-off during certain hours. The smoothies are have a nice creamy texture and not too sweet. The only thing I didn't like was their salad because the lettuce was a little wilted and the dressing was too thick but the smoothies are the focal point so my review remains at 5 stars!

Ryan was quick to respond and helpful with answering my questions. He also was able to accommodate my schedule and rearrange our meetup on the same day a couple hours in advance. My iPhone 5c is not cracked anymore, yay!

I found this place off of a Groupon that I had purchased. I've had my lashes done by Hadley, who works for herself, twice now and it's been fun each time! She's really friendly and is definitely the conversationalist! She made time fly while we got to know each other during my appointment. She's extremely flexible and responds back right away via text! I've text her late at night without expecting a response the next day but she got back within 15 minutes. Not to mention that she had a child a few weeks before my first visit and she was still able to squeeze me in last minute before Christmas! It's always nice to connect with people who work in this kind of industry because you want to trust that whoever is working on any part of your body/face is going to do a great job and has your best intentions! I will be recommending her to friends who are also interested in getting doe-eyed with mink lashes!

I used an old groupon I had purchased months ago, originally for a different salon but to my surprise the stylist it was specific for had opened up his own place, House of Loyal T! It was a cute, boutique style salon and there was a family of 5 already getting their haircut by Tyler and Jessica. Jessica ultimately cut my hair, and she did a great job! I explained to her that I'm pretty finicky about who cuts my hair, having only gone to Regis stylists but I'm glad I took a chance with this place. I have long, dark brown hair that I like styled in simple ways and she kept the cut the same, only getting rid of 3-4 inches of dead hair. She blow dried it was a round brush and put some of their own hair spray in it for some shine and it turned out beautiful! I was in there for a while, but because I talked to Jessica the whole time it seemed like minutes. They were both very friendly and sweet, I really enjoyed the experience I had at their salon! I would recommend this salon because they listen to what you want. I only get my hair cut once or twice a year and I definitely see myself coming back again!

By far, the BEST nightclub I've visited in Vegas! My sister and I went to Vegas this past weekend to see Mariah Carey and Omnia was an obvious choice because it was right where the concert was. We had a few options since we were on a few different guest lists, courtesy of Vegas' finest club promoters... lol. We also had an option with a free table somewhere else, but we decided to try this place (plus we had never gone before). The line was super long for guest list and were about to check out XS when we were approached by a doorman (assuming) and said to wait in the ladies' line for 10 min. He was accurate about the wait time and still got in for free with reservations with a promoter we met earlier in the day. Unbeknownst to us there was more than one dance room and only stayed in the hip hop room, but it was amazing! It was incredibly crowded, which was to be expected, so we boogied out butts in to join the mob! They played great music including E40 (gotta love the yay area hyphy movement!), Fetty Wap, and lots more! We were in there for 3 hours dancing nonstop. Even when I thought about leaving since my feet hurt I stayed because each and every song was so damn good! Electronica and house music is good too but gets old too fast, I need something with rhythm! We made our way towards the middle of the floor and somehow ended up towards the front on the other side by ways of being pushed or nudged with elbows and butts haha! Every so often they had gusts of fog/cold air blow into the crowd which felt no nice after the longest minutes of your life sweating to some good tunes. When we finally made our way out of the club, that's when we saw the main dance floor. We walked in to take a peek and just left since we couldn't rally enough energy to squeeze into another filled up room. I LOVED every moment!

I had a drink here once in December and wasn't impressed but gave it another shot today to see if their other drinks were any better. I ordered the mochaccino because I wanted something with coffee in it. When I got it I saw that it was a blended drink that wasn't in the description in the menu. They were out of honey boba so they gave me vanilla instead. That part wasn't a big deal but I found neither kind of boba (had the honey boba in December too) had much flavor. I opted to try the coffee jelly but the texture reminded me of rubber. It seemed as though all of the flavor/liquid quickly sank to the bottom because when I moved my straw up and sipped it tasted more icey and not like coffee. The packaging of the cups are pretty bulky and awkward, I'm not a fan of it. I had to slam the straw at least 3 times til it broke through the seal and when it finally did it exploded and got some of the drink splattered of me. It left a gash in the top of my drink. I really felt like this was a waste of almost $7. It Tea Street were closer I would have gone there instead.

My friend and I got some piercings done last night as a random act, if you will. It was kind of hard to find since the sign on the building only says TATTOO but it's right next to Thai House Restaurant if that helps any of you looking for it!  We chose this place because it was close (to where I lived), it had good ratings and it was open late. The staff was nice and Justin (the one who pierced us) was soft-spoken but hilarious in his own way lol. My friend got 3 piercings in her left ear while I got my right nostril pierced. It was pretty much empty by the time we finished the paperwork and headed in the back. Another tattoo artist and the receptionist came into the room with us to watch and joke around. It made the piercing quick and simple! Even though I received a plain piece of jewelry for now they didn't have much of a selection for future purchases, that was the only con for me. Other than that I would definitely recommend this shop if you want quick, efficient and friendly service :)
