This location is our typical stop for movies and we are all about AMCs in general because of their comfortable spacious chairs. Took my son here a few weeks ago and planned on spending my gift card. I had gotten quite a few for Christmas so when the cashier told me I only had a couple bucks on it I was kind of surprised but paid the remaining in cash and didn't think much of it. After I got my home my boyfriend had told me we didn't have any other gift cards left and there was no way it only had 2 bucks left on it. I looked at the receipt and realized he charged my stubs card (rewards program) the two bucks, NOT my gift card and since he kept the gift card there was really no way to prove this or look it up. My receipt did show though that the stubs card was used and not the gift card. I called the next day and spoke with the manager and after explanation he asked me to come down and pick up 4 re-entry passes. When I got there he didn't ask questions he just took my word for it. Personally I feel he made up for the mistake and it's refreshing to have someone value their customers and want to make them happy. This location will remain our normal stop. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is the staff is a little ditzy, and slow.

Let me start out by saying I could wander around a Whole Foods store for hours upon hours, I love everything they carry. I prefer the Chandler Whole Foods because it is brighter, and more spacious but I don't really count that against the Tempe location. But what I do consider is the staff...the staff at this location is rude! This location is on my way to school so I make it work. First of all I could walk around in a circle for 40 minutes in the beauty/vitamin department and no one would even bother asking if I needed help, as they watch me walk around forever (this has happened twice already). Technically I didn't need help but it would have been nice to have the offer. The main reason I hit this place up is the juice/smoothie bar. The first time I went in I was looking for a V8-esque type vegetable juice...I didn't see anything on their menu like that so since there is a build-your-own option I asked if they could make a V8 type juice. OH MY GOD...how dare I refer to that preservative laced arsenic in a can??!?! The girl looked at me like I was nuts and responded "I don't even know what a V8 juice is"...oh OK, sure you don't! Anyway like I said I just usually stop in for juices because I am too lazy to make my own. I always wait at least 10 minutes just to put in the order (in the morning)...I understand it takes a while to make the juices but this is usually due to 1 or 2 people running the whole juice bar and 5 people in line. Secondly they rarely get the size right, and if they do get the size right then they get the price wrong. I've caught this 4 times and they have had to correct it. It is just a disaster but like I said it is convenient so I will probably keep going on occasion. If I want to do any grocery shopping I will just stick with the Chandler location, they seem to have better variety and it is easier to maneuver around in the store! Yes, it's expensive but that is to be expected. You can score some really good deals if you watch their ads and match their coupons with manufacturer coupons!

Second time I've ordered from this location, and second time they've gotten the order wrong. Tonight my son ordered a vegan pizza, yet it was brought with cheese. He ran out to catch the driver.. The driver told him to call in to let them know. So he calls in and they say it's on the way. An hour later it's still not here. I call back in and the manager says he doesn't know why the girl told me that and that it just came out of the oven. Oh and FYI a medium vegan pizza with tip is almost close to $40!!! The delivery driver dropped off the new pizza TWO hours later.. He tells me "you can have the pizza for free".. So I stood there waiting for a refund, and nothing. So I called back and of course they see no reason to refund me. I gave the second delivery driver a tip since it's obviously not his fault. So $38 for a cold vegan pizza two hours later. Clearly I won't be ordering from this location again.

I am always in search of a good burger...while my search will always continue this place will go in my top 5! We must have gotten there just at the right time because there wasn't much of a line. I did however see the "cash only" sign right away which might be annoying to some. This is my kinda place though-a hole in the wall with delicious simple food! I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and I loooove how they made the circular bacon to fill the whole burger! I can see how the condiment station might be a turnoff for some but considering I like my burger pretty plain it didn't really bother me. We rode the light rail so we didn't have issues with parking but I can see how the parking might be problematic around lunch time. I dig the tree stumps as chairs but that's just me. We got 2 burgers/fries and 2 drinks for 20 bucks and it was worth every penny. Every few months I think about becoming a vegetarian, it's places like this that make me realize what a ludicrous idea that would be!

My son and I went into this shop after he recently got interested in paint ball. He was looking to spend his Christmas money on a paintball gun after doing some research. I myself know nothing about paintball so I was relieved that Julie took the time to explain the different guns to us as well as taking quite a bit of time to explain how to clean and take care of the gun after the purchase. She treated my 12 year old like a real consumer even before he decided to purchase. Some small businesses frown upon younger customers it seems at times but she was super friendly and informative. I can't comment on the pricing due to we have not shopped around but he walked out of there spending a little over a 100 with a great starter gun. They had quite the variety, in stock, and the shop was very clean. She also gave us free passes to Tempe Paint Ball. We will def be using Dark Star for all of our paintball needs.

Well Pei Wei in itself is awesome.. I enjoy the food. This review is for this particular location ONLY. My boyfriend and I eat Pei Wei 2-4 times a month. I live about a mile and a half away from the Dana Park location. We do take out every time and every time I get the same thing, orange peel steak. I do not like rice (yes, I know, I know) so I always order mine on the side and give it to someone else. So basically one time I picked up the order, rice was on the side but when I got home I noticed they must have messed up and initially mixed it with the meal because I had rice with my steak, but they scraped off as much as possible. I let it go, I was too lazy to get dressed, grab my keys and head out. Well it happened a second time and the more I thought about someone sitting there scraping rice off my food the more pissed I got. The manager was there, I told her what had happened and that this was the second occasion for this. She had them remake the steak and sent me on my merry little way. It is not my style to be rude when someone messes up but geez offer me a soda when I am sitting there, throw in a 20 percent off coupon for the next order, or comp the entree you messed up! I am not one who is looking for freebies or else I would have taken my food back the first time this happened. The managers non-apologetic, blah-zeh attitude about THEIR mistake left me with a bad taste. I will be traveling 3 miles out of my way to the other location from now on.

So I basically was with this insurance agent for over 5 years and while I must say I was quite satisfied for the most part, things went south real fast once his business started growing. Well I assume business started growing because it was hard to actually speak to the agent like I was used to and as time went by it seemed every time I called just to do something simple like make a payment or a change I would get a different person each time (which was no big deal at first). To make a long story short after switching vehicles I could not get a consistent monthly price for my policy. Each time I called to straighten it out I would get a different person each time along with a different price and they couldn't seem to figure out what was going on with the policy. Once I finally did make a payment (even though no one could figure out the correct amount) just so I wouldn't be cancelled, I was informed the next day that I overpaid. When the following month came around, I was told I was late and didn't pay enough the prior month. It just became such a hassle to even make a simple payment, they just couldn't get their stuff together after I had changed vehicles.  At this point I told one of the employees I really needed to speak with the agent to get this sorted out so instead of calling me he emails me and says... Wait for it...... "I'm going to take the weekend to figure out how to explain this in a way you will actually understand".., yep! I was pretty much appalled and called American Family within the hour. Which I might mention the agent at American Family actually answered the phone and remembered me from being her client over 5 years ago. Don't get me wrong I used to brag about my Allstate agent prior to all this going down but if you are going to hire other employees to work for you (which you would expect) then they should be well trained and consistent. I was never rude while this fiasco took place and I was more patient than I needed to be. I would not recommend this agent, nor would I recommend Allstate as I also had an issue with them reimbursing me for a tow after I was told by customer service everything was approved. My rate dropped by 23 bucks a month with American Family.

All about serving was excellent all around. I would say the best part was they were the cheapest I had come across, especially since the location of the person I needed served was in Scottsdale. Darren was super nice, professional, and kept in constant communication the whole time. He got the whole thing done within 2 days from the serving to the filing with the courts. I called late in the day, he instantly went and picked up the paperwork and got on the case. I called three other places and the prices were at least 20 higher than his, others based theirs on location, and you would have to give them a week just to initiate the serving, most charged for expediting if you needed it within 2 days. So by far All About Serving stands above the rest!

This place is AWESOME! They use local ingredients, very reasonable prices, and the portions are huge. Fast and friendly. While in the drive-thru you can peek in and they are always using gloves, washing their hands, etc. A few more salad choices would be nice but it's such a  novel idea so I can't complain! Lunch time is super busy, faster to go to stand in window. Their organic sodas are also very yummy!

Seriously OBSESSED with this place! So glad I ventured over to this gem instead of the typical restaurants on campus. I looove the ambiance. Food takes slightly longer to come out but being fresh and local I think it is worth it. The carrot ginger soup is amazing. They have great macaroons, grilled cheese, fresh cut fries, it's all wonderful!

Where should I start??? Music blaring, baristas dancing, jolly, always upbeat! I gave up my Starbucks coffee a looong time ago even before Dutch Bros. got closer to my house..There's nothing fantastic about Starbucks, you can taste the commercialization with every sip you take! I typically drink tea but occasionally I will get a hankering for an iced, creamy coffee (especially today when I need the coffee buzz)..So I decide to go out of my comfort zone and seek out a place that does cold brew (supposed to be healthier and blah blah). I go to a place down the street (review up next), and order an cold brew coffee. Long story short it was like drinking ice water with vanilla/caramel syrup through a straw. I immediately drove to Dutch Bros. to get my fix and had to share with the barista how I had cheated and would never do it again. Dude gave me a free coffee! Who does that??? Dutch Bros., that's who! I loved them before that but just adore them now. You can go there in a bad mood and instantly get lifted...their energy is contagious! Ingredients are true, and everything I have tried, I've loved. Sometimes the line can get long (which attests to their product) but they have someone hustling taking orders outside and its moves super quick!

I was blown away! To be honest I thought this was just a place in a strip mall that could offer some relaxation. That couldn't be further from the truth. Yes, it is in a strip mall, and yes you can get relaxation but the staff here is incredible! My son has a movement disorder and has been asking me to take him here, so I finally set up an appointment. One thing is they have always been able to fit him in. Secondly once you walk in you immediately are whisked away into a calm, relaxed environment. All staff members have this calming soothing voice that just puts you at ease right away. The first visit the staff spoke to me about my son's disorder to get to know him and his needs. I even stayed after and the owner talked to me and gave me some suggestions. They really care and want to help with whatever ails you. I would recommend this place to anyone to give it a try.
