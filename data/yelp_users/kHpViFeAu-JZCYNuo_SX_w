I have stopped by this place on occasion while in the area on the weekends. Not sure why since the service has always been horrible. My group of friends decided to head there with some other friends visiting. We were stopped by the bouncers at the door and told we needed a reservation or buy a $1000 bottle table in order to get in. We thought it was a joke. They are so not Vegas or L.A. They claimed it was at capacity and we could see no one on the patio area, nor many people inside. Our group had females and males, and sharply dressed. This place and the service in general is so shoddy for a self proclaimed upscale establishment. They have a lost a customer and I will inform anyone and everyone not to go there.

This is my go to spot when going to Vegas. The staff and hotel treat me, us, very well! They have upgraded me for no reason other than to be the kool hotel they are. The Pool Villa is awesome!!!
