I've had it with BofA and this branch in particular.  The parking lot is ridiculously small and presided over by a security guy who takes his job way too seriously ("No, really, I'm going to the bank!).  Once in you'll be greeted with the ubiquitous "how's it going?"  Well, it would be going a hell of a lot better if we could drop the drivel and process my deposit, thank you.  I've switched most of my accounts to Alliance Bank but still have a federal employee withholding account with the bank.  Having carelessly run out of company checks I went in the other day to request a counter check.  "I'm sorry, we don't do counter checks."  Really.  Is it that complicated?  It seems  they do just about everything else because every time I go I'm stuck behind a horde of people with tales of "the wire transfer was supposed to happen" or "there used to be a lot of money in this account."  Does anyone at BofA do banking anymore?  You know, deposits and withdrawals.  Absent of drama, please. I honestly believe BofA has made a strategic decision to be the bank for the masses.  That's fine but it no longer includes me.

If you've ever driven down Indian School Road near 21st street you may have wondered about The Toy Box with its assorted classic cars on display in its front window.  Sure, TTB works on a fair number of great old cars but don't be intimidated.  Phil, Andy and the whole crew are a great bunch and work on all types of cars.  You'll get honest service at a great price and, most likely, will make a few new friends. The crew here has worked on my '72 3.0 CS for several years now.  First, it was to finish the restoration I'd contracted with another shop then to change out my carburetor jets so the car would pass emissions.  With an old car, no matter its degree of restoration, there is always work to do and TTB has since worked on my air conditioning unit, suspension and drive train.  I wouldn't trust my car anywhere else.  If you have a classic this is the best shop in town.  But if you're looking for a shop for your daily driver, give them a chance too.  An honest repair shop.  What a concept!

A first impression of this modest, stand-alone, building just east of 16th street is likely to be misleading.  Dyna-Tronics is the "go to" place when your prized amplifier or flat screen t.v. head south. I found Dyna-Tronics when my four-months-out-of-warranty Sharp Aquos flat screen lost its sound.  Turns out that the Aquos, the top end of Sharp's LCD flat screens, is prone to this problem.  At the suggestion of Dyna-Tronics I called Sharp to see if they'd honor the repair, but, no, they were entirely unhelpful.  Fortunately for me, that wasn't the case with Dyna-Tronics, who fixed my t.v. for a relatively modest amount and in time for the super bowl to boot.   The staff here are informed and helpful and there is a decent selection of old electrons for the true audiophile.

This review is only about the rental department.  I'm not a big Harley fan but it's the only bike (that I'm aware of) that you can rent for a day ride.  I've rented from CHD a half dozen times, Fat Boys, Road Kings, Rockers, etc.  Each time the staff has been pleasant and helpful.  The same two guys have worked the rentals forever and, providing you show up properly dressed and seem to know enough to assure them you won't kill yourself or anyone else, are always a hoot.   The only reason I don't give this place five stars is that the rental rate can get a bit pricey.  That said, my most recent rental was only $89, so maybe  they've lowered their rates (or the bike I rented simply cost less).  I've always found the bikes in great shape and, if one were seriously contemplated a HD purchase, I'd recommend they head here for rental beforehand.  Great staff, great bikes.

This is outside my area of town so I frequent ZB only a couple of times a year.  That said, I've done this trip for a few years and in all my meals I've yet to be anything but pleased.  ZB gets a lot of things right.  You might notice that all the salt and pepper shakers are placed in the same location at every table or that the wait staff answers questions with clarity and professionalism.  Both are examples of the standard of excellence exhibited by the owner of this excellent establishment.  I've had most of the salads here and always opt for the pommes frites.  Truly excellent.  If you love chocolate (and who doesn't?) order the chocolate souffle with your entree.  It's decadent, gooey and absolutely delicious.  The gripe with ZB is that it's so popular some people are turned off by the wait, scottsdale crowd, etc.  Don't be.  Zinc is the best bistro in town and worthy of a visit.  I'm sure you'll come back for more.

It's always surprising to find yourself on the wrong side of the zeitgeist.  Such is my experience with Mary Coyle.  I've gone to MC several times over the last couple of months and only one time could I bring myself to actually sit down.  The place is filthy.  On top of that unpleasantry the bus staff is likely to be found smoking in the back parking lot while un-bussed tables piled with half eaten sundays and used napkins run amok.  The last two times I visited there was a strong and very obvious sewer issue.  How people can eat here is beyond me.  Maybe I was just unlucky and my three experiences were not the norm.  I certainly hope so but I can't bring myself to give them a fourth chance.

It's hard not to like the nostalgia of this place but the hostess is rude, the bartenders surely and the food mediocre. There are simply too many other choices.

I never wrote a review for Palatte, though it was my home-away-from-home several times each week.  Frankly, I didn't write because it was too personal for me.  I loved the food, camaraderie and friendship of Ed and Christine (and Ruby).  Although I took friends often, it never occurred to me that the place might be under water; that I should do more.  In retrospect that was naive.  Great ingredients and good service cost money.  Palatte will be missed.  Downtown has lost its anchor.

I'm reviewing the retail side of Fine's Cellars since it's out of my normal area of town and I have not eaten at its restaurant.  Let me just say this about Michael Fine, he's been in the retail end of the wine business for a long time (name a longer running wine store than Sportsmans) and he knows both a lot about wine and a lot about what wine sells.  I recently visited FC for a saturday afternoon tasting.  Now, all of the wine tasted was meant to be drunk NOW.  This wasn't a high-end tasting but that's exactly the point.  We left the tasting with two cases of good wine, wine we'll drink most evenings, and paid less than $9 a bottle.  Good luck finding a better deal anywhere in town.  Fine Cellars is serious about fair pricing on good, easy drinking wines.  Care for something more up-town?  This is your place for once-a-year Turley allocations or any number of terrific bottles.  Chateau Montelena, Schaffer, Freemark Abbey, they're all here.  Looking for something truly special?  There's a good selection of old world varietals and if you talk with Michael  he'll find something for you.  This is not the largest wine retailer in town but you won't be disappointed with the selection, prices or service.

I went to La Boca two night in a row, Sunday/Monday, when I had to be in Tempe.  The first night our party of six were enjoying our pizzas when I casually mentioned that we'd ordered one pizza without mushrooms and some had found their way unto it.  Within a a couple of minutes the manager was at our table with an apology and an offer to comp a couple of deserts.  Geez, it was just an errant mushroom!  In fact, the pizza here is very good and they clearly go the extra mile in trying to accommodate their customers. I was please enough to return the next night with my wife and share a Margarita pizza (which is very good).  Wanting something sweet to finish off our meal, we opted for the chocolate mousse.  While it may not have been the ultimate dessert it was quite good and we enjoyed several bites before deciding we'd had enough to satisfy without adding unnecessarily to our growing waistlines.  Seeing we'd only eaten a bit, the waitress comped the dessert.  We explained we'd been happy with the mousse and were just full but she took it off the bill just the same.   Now, there are a lot of choices where to eat and a whole lot of pizza joints, but for my money a little extra courtesy goes a long way.  Couple that with good food and reasonable prices and La Bocca is sure to see more of me.

OK decor, CenPho location and decent ice cream.  That pretty much wraps up my feelings except for exceedingly slooooooow service.  In defense of the counter staff, there's only been one person working every time I've gone and I'm inevitably behind a large group ordering multiple sundays.  I'm probably better off going to AJs or Fresh & Easy for gelato.

This studio is hip, clean and altogether great looking.  There's a nice selection of goods and the staff is both friendly and helpful.  The studio is large and comfortable with a mirrored front wall and a rustic brick side wall.  There are private rooms for independent or small-group practice and massage is supposedly going to be added in the immediate future.  I'm relatively new to Yoga, having only taken classes intermittently and never in a real studio.  UY made me feel comfortable from my first class and left me wanting to return.  There are all levels offered and even the beginner classes leave me feeling refreshed and invigorated (and, yes, sore the next day!).  There are a lot of options in Yoga studios but Urban Yoga should definitely be on your list.

I've eaten at Noca twice, once on a Sunday with their prix fix menu and then on Christmas Eve.  I can honestly say those are two of the best dining experiences in recent memory.  Dinner at Noca always begins with an amuse bouche. Our puree of guacamole with a small potato chip was perfect; great flavor and crunch.  The owner (Eliot? - a very nice and helpful man) suggested the scallop ceviche for an appetizer.  It was briny, fresh and very tasty.  Our group had everything from steak frittes to vegetarian ravioli and everyone raved about their food. While the kitchen is open, the six chefs work quietly, everyone intent on their own task.  The wait staff (Carl) was the best I've ever had; informative, attentive and polite.  I hear that this is the owners first restaurant but that's hard to believe.  Noca gets so many things right. While this is certainly a food-serious environ, the prices are reasonable for the quality and attention present.  Don't be put off by its location in a Safeway shopping center.  Noca is a serious restaurant for a serious good time!

I've eaten at ATS three times now and I've been consistently pleased with their food.  The staff is friendly, there's a real buzz to the place (especially around lunch time) and the decor, while simple, is simply nice.  While not a big meat eater, the carne asada tacos are hard to resist and the vegetarian quesadilla is terrific.   I'm sure there will be some who think the food is a bit pricey but it's all of high quality and, in my estimation, well worth the money.  There are plenty of options for cheap Mexican.  For my money, ATS is a great addition to the neighborhood.

I'm really surprised at the positive reviews for this place.  I wanted to like it, being a big fan of AZ88 and all.  Maybe I just don't understand the need to change a winning formula.  Sure, variety is nice but not in and of itself.  I found the wait staff both unhelpful and unpleasant, a very unfortunate combination.  The food was flavorless (the beet salad was right out of a can?) and the drinks small and pricey.  Five of us rang up a $200 bill with a bit more than usual drinking, all in a failed attempt to find the sizzle in this dud.  I'm all for downtown establishments but they have to meet a modicum of quality and value.  In my opinion Hanny's does not.

I have nothing but positive things to say about Tuck Shop.  The decor is contemporary and thoughtfully laid out.  There's a small bar and a comfortable seating area in addition to the main dining area.  You can order in any of the three areas and the wait staff is both kind and helpful.  We had two appetizers and three entrees to share among three people and were plenty satisfied.  The potato wedges with aioli were fantastic, as was the beet salad.  The panini "bites" were large enough to share and the chocolate soufflé was a great end to a terrific meal.  This place is a great addition to the "downtown" scene!  It's both casual and a pseudo-foodie place.  I can't wait to try the owners Sunday prix fix meals.

A boutique pet store in CenPho!  Can it get any better than that?  Seriously, this is an uber-hip store with great products for your four-legged best friend or imperious kitty.  All products are high quality and are either arizona based or give back a portion of their sale to charity.  I thought the dog collars were very cool and fairly priced.  This is also the only store in town that carries Honest Kitchen dog food.  If you haven't tried this food be prepared to be amazed in the difference it will make in your pets health.  It seems odd to feed dehydrated food to your dog (it takes only a couple of minutes to rehydrate into a green, soupy mixture) but my boxers love it and it's made a marked improvement in their coat and overall health.  Like all of the products at O&A, you'll find quality, attention to detail and great customer service.  The store is also active with many local rescue groups and animal charities.  Conscience and style.  It really doesn't get any better.

OK, I'm adding a star to PastaBar because the food deserves it.  That and the "Jack on Mulberry Street" cocktail - very tasty.  So, I've figured out what didn't strike me initially about PB.  It's not so much the art as the whole decor.  It's not bad.  It''s just not as put together as I'd hoped for a downtown local.  It's fine really, just not my style.  The food on the other hand is sublime; inventive and flavorful.  The portions are absolutely fair as is the price.  Now if I can just get them to lower the price of that great cocktail!

For many years my family and I came here when it was Katz's Deli.  Then, $1.95 got you the breakfast special of two eggs, hash brown potatoes and a bagel of your choice (weekday's only).  Howard and Wanda (?) would be happy to see what has become of their neighborhood place.  Postino Central is still very familiar to those who remember its earlier incarnation but it's now clean and hip, and still very inviting.  If you're a patron of LGO or any number of their other restaurants, you know this group just gets it.   The menu and layout are right out of the original Postino.  Hey, if you've got a winning formula why screw it up (are you listening Hanny's?)?  The outdoor patio has an open bar to the main restaurant a la Chelsea's Kitchen.  It works here too, bringing some of the interior vibe outside.  The principal problem with LGO, it's parking, has been addressed with a large number of spaces and complementary valet parking.  Very nice. I was interested in the bathrooms (that didn't sound right), as their location is basically unchanged from the original, though dramatically improved.  The guy's has a funky sliding door and the girl's two sinks.  I'm guessing this has something to do with the fairer sex's inclination to potty in tandem, though I admit I'm unclear of the benefit of the two sink, one toilet layout.  Interesting. You have to hand it to this group.  They take interesting buildings and make them better (when it's obviously cheaper to just tear them down and start over), they locate in real neighborhoods and improve the property values and they know how to stick with a winning formula.  If you know Postino you won't be surprised by Postino Central but you will be happy you came.

I may be a bit too enthusiastic about Gallo Blanco because I've been craving a genuine taqueria with great food and reasonable prices.  Gallo Blanco delivers on both fronts.  The owner was the founding chef at LGO and his attention to quality ingredients shows.  We started with the Chicharron de Queso - sort of a fried cheese crisp - with a terrific aioli dipping sauce.  The Queso wasn't my favorite but my wife loved it.  Things picked up with the vegetable of the day - baked asparagus.  Well seasoned and absolutely delicious.  The highlight for me was the Carne Asada Torta ($6.00), a delicious sandwich with a fried egg on top.  Truly spectacular.  I'll come back for this dish alone but don't let that stop you from trying the rest of the menu. The Vegetarian taco (Verduras de Temporada) was spectacular and at only $2.00, you should order a few to fill up.  We finished our meal with the Postre de Chocolate, a pudding, marshmallow and graham cracker dessert that is to smores what creme boule is to caramel.   We also tried several of GB's drinks.  The Michelada ($5.00) was refreshing and tasty and the Horchata very tasty (and much less sweet than the saccharin types served too often).  I also tried a Vodka Aguas Frescas ($7.00) - in this case, watermelon, not my favorite fruit but still darn tasty.  When I commented that I'd order it again with a bit more lime and alcohol another appeared gratis.  These people care about their customers.  With great food and a great location (how about a cocktail on the rooftop afterward?) Gallo Blanco is a great addition to the CenPho dining scene.

I had to update my review to share a very important finding since my first review.  Gallo Blanco has the best guacamole you'll ever taste.  Bet on it.  There's more going on here than you're standard guac but it's still familiar enough to bring to mind all your favorite onion, cilantro, lime and guacamole memories.  Now add orange - or what I think was orange but somehow much, much better than you can possibly imagine.  My continuous improvement suggest for GB is that all guacamole orders come with a privacy screen.  It's just too good not to dive in without abandon, making a complete and utter fool of yourself.  This chef has a deft touch and a very refined sense of balance with flavors.  Do not pass up the guac!
