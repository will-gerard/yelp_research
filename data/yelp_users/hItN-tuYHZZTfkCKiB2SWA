Awesome bagel shop. Definitely reminds me of Jersey bagels. Dont order a veggie omelet though...mushrooms taste like can. But everything else is super delicious.  Love love love me some bagel!

Great hotel casino. Especially great service at the pool.  Best bartender ever is Erica! She makes sure to be attentive and talks to you as though you're a long lost friend.  The other bartender the day before just gives you margarita without asking you anymore questions. Erica asked if you want it on the rocks, with salt and either clear or gold tequila. Wish she was at every bar.

I had the fried clam strips and my other half the fish and chips.  The clam strips had no clams but really strips made of cornmeal and flour.  The fish in the fish and chips were either meaty big chunks or majority breading and thing fish leather that was overcooked and over breaded.  Pricey for no quality, not even a little quality. Bleh. Great location, but awful food.  Shall we talk about the fishing line decoration on the balcony that was interesting with the spider webs everywhere? Maybe stick to french fries.

Best CUBAN food ever. This place is a family owned restaurant that is super authentic.  We have made this our necessary go to place every time we are in Vegas. Get the lemonade,  tostones, cuban sandwich,  anything! You wont be disappointed!

Awesome coffee and breakfast. They have a great system for reoccurring costumers and the vibe is awesome. Some days you can listen to live music on the patio or just enjoy the awesome vibes and atmosphere.

Horrible service but great food. If you want to eat on time and get served by a happy waitstaff then DONT eat here. But if youre willing to spend $40 on a cold steak and have a rude waitress, this place is perfect for you. Even after we complained to the manager, we only got our desserts compd but not a single apology.

Very great service and staff. The food is delicious and everyone was so polite. They came over to check on us and talk to our big party. Definitely recommend this place!

Deliciously awesome. We had the espresso ice cream in the waffle cone.  When we first opened the door the smell of fresh waffle cones filled the air.  They were making them then.  Super delicious and cute place.  I am subtracting one start bc the older woman helping us could use a happy pill. She seemed to be in a bad mood and not so happy to serve people.  For petes sake lady, you work at an ice cream shop.  Have fun with it!

IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE IN AN AMBULANCE: And end up in the ER all night (after fainting and going into convulsions) like both my other half and my friends wife did on Friday night, right after their meal...then go ahead and risk your entire weekend (and possibly life, depending on your age) by eating this terribly low quality, toxic, unsanitary, poisonous food...and enjoy the bill at full price with not a single item removed or even an simple I'm sorry from anyone in the restaurant. Worst experience ever! Ruined our birthday dinner and everyone's weekend. And both girls still don't feel right 5 days later...

Getting worse and worse. Has definitely changed in quality and personality since last year. We were so excited about this place when it first opened. Blackened Tilapia Caesar salad was one we craved. We loved the man that was there too, I think he was/is the owner.  We haven't seen him in months and the staff has seemed to change.  Not only has the waitstaff got to (BLEEP) but the food too.  The blackened tilapia is no where near as delicious as it was before and there is some funky too sweet for a caesar salad going on. I could probably go on and on about our waitress who didn't seem to have much screws tight in her head at all.  How about be happy about your job or dont rub your bad day on us.  If you have nothing to do all day and want to wait on your waitress, go here. If you have a life and dont want to waist hours on hours then definitely do not go here.  Revo Burrito down Camelback is WAY BETTER than this place

Surprisingly shocked how good the food was here considering its a western bar. The meatloaf is to live for! Apparently there is an 83 year old man who goes in everyday just to make the meatloaf. Yummm

Great service, ambiance, and food. We stumbled upon this place and it has now become one of our favorite restaurants in Arizona. We had the Lomo Saltado and Papa Relleno and all we could say was "yummmmm" in between every bite. We recommend this to everyone!

The food is delicous and the service was great.  Had the lobster bisque which wasn't too rich, just right.  The pork chop was the best we've had in a while.  Oh and the green tea, superb!!!

The service was great and the ambience was good.  We didnt feel rushed and enjoyed our long breakfast/lunch.  The people were so nice not to rush us out, it wasn't until I noticed the open sign facing our way did we think to ask them what time they close.  Apparenlty, it was an hour past the point I noticed.  They let us hang out, even gave us a free brownie and chocolate chip cookie which was to live for!.  The owners are very nice.  I ordered half a club sandwich and tortilla soup with sweet potato fries.  The sandwich much bigger than my bite could handle but delish! My boyfriend had a huge breakfast burrito.  The portions are massive!!!! The only thing is that we were expecting more pork options..at least pork chop or pulled pork items on the menu. But, it is definitely a place we will go back to.

Only good thing was the band and volunteers helping with the service.  Truly would give this place no star if it was an option. My intention was to a find a new church for the family that was uplifting, inspiring, and to feel God's love through story and scriptures....however what we got was the COMPLETE opposite. Yesterday's 10:30 mass was terrible. The preacher was not even physically there, we watched him on projectors with the volume too loud. The sermon started with disasters, death, terror etc. It seemed like the preacher was instilling fear in us through multiple examples and an overly long preach justifying terror, fear, and grief. After feeling low and starting to get anxiety we left.. while he was yelling about the "devil, saying demonic examples, and more delish banter." It was too much negativity and not a way to start a Sunday. He even said to not associate with those who think they are Christian like but aren't acting like it. My GOD would never turn his back on others. I feel sorry for the preacher.

Love this place for all their quality foods, treats, and eventa for our pup. They care about our 4 legged pup and us as well. The owners have become our friends and we even made a few fountain hills friends at spikes events. Definitely recommended!

Ran in quickly to get an iced coffee. Paid $3.75 for something so small and wasn't told the price only got my change back. The iced coffee was terrible. Worse coffee ever. Should've drove to Starbucks to get better coffee and service for the same price. Bleh

Great sushi, atmosphere, staff, and service.  Deducting one star for the purple rice, although I really wanted to love it.  It was just harder, maybe they could've made it a little more moist like the good japanese rice.  Definitely will go back.  Make sure to sit by the sushi bar, you get "gifts" from the chef ;-)

This place is so awesome, Im writing a review while still at the dinner table. The wedge salad and the prime rib special was to LIVE for. Not to mention, they gave the birthday boy an excellent dessert. Will Definitely come back!

Absolutely great environment, food, and drinks.  We heard the food is mostly organic and local but they don't advertise it.  The blackened salmon or smoked salmon is delish! Love the Kale and Lox Salad, Bison Burger, Salmon Burger, the Bib salad, Burger, Veggie Burger, and Pulled Pork Sandwich. (Yes, we've been here a lot and love it)    Why I give them 4 stars and not a 5 are due to the things that I could pass on: the wings (smoked and grilled = weird taste), the fried pickles (batter is too thick), cheddar bacon tater tots (deceiving, really a spanish croquetta not a tater tot) The hummus and veggies is pretty good, the hummus is with white beans so it gives it a saltier taste...unique but ehhh.  Great weekend all day happy hour of $5 margs, mimosas, and bloodies.  Lots of tvs for sporting games and delicious beers!   Love this place!
