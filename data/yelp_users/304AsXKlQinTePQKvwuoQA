Happy hour 24-7... can't get better than that and they have a better sushi selection than RA sushi. I wish the place was bigger. They finally have gift cards and a Pearl Reviews point card  SCORE!

Make sure you ask them how their Peking duck is made to order. I order a WHOLE PEKING DUCK to have for my thanksgiving meal with my family. Apparently they make their different with only half duck worth feeding 2 people then the rest is minced with lettuce wraps. That isn't what I wanted. Then had to go thru a process to get a manager just to get a roasted ducked. They need to update tire menu with a better description

They have no idea how to do NFL Sunday football to cater to all NFL fans. They kept changing channels and half of there tv signs where games were suppose to be located did not match. Don't bother coming for a game unless your a Browns fans (no offense to the Browns fans). They need to take NFL Sunday customer service from other bars who have experience. The owner was a douche and lied about certain tv's being linked together just bc he was to much of an ass to change to the tv the sign stated in the 1st place....
