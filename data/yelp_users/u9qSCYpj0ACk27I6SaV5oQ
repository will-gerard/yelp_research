I love this place. The food is always delicious. I came for lunch today and had Pho which was as good as any Vietnamese place I've gone to. I don't know my waitresses name but she was adorable, extremely nice and attentive. Dinner can get very busy and the wait times can get long, but it's worth it.

Great job! They were able to fit me in as a walk in even though they were very busy. The pedi was great and the fill was even better. Finally after many tries I found a place that didn't cut me with the drill. I will absolutely be back. Everyone was so friendly and knew each other by names. Obviously a well loved establishment.

The coffee is awesome, the food is delicious! Plenty of table space for getting work done, but very loud so if you need quiet to work not a good study spot.

The service was fast and friendly, and the food was all delicious. I've been here before for drinks, but this was my first lunch time experience and it was great. I would come here to eat again.

My son's last dentist tried telling us that our 9 year old who has only lost 4 baby teeth needed braces, so naturally we looked elsewhere since that notion was absolutely absurd. So after some searching I decided to give this place a try and I am very happy I did. The staff is extremely friendly, the waiting room is beautiful and equipped with game centers for the kids while they wait. The Doctor was gentle and good at explaining everything and was shocked when I told him about the last dentist and the braces. He also thought it would be ridiculous. All together it was a good experience for my son and I. I would recommend this one to anyone needing a dentist they know isn't going to tell them they need things they don't just to make a buck.

I loved this nail salon, I have been going there for 6 months or so to get my acrylics done and filled. I have seen synthea ( I think I got her name spelled wrong, but it's not done the usual way). She is always there with a smile on her face and wonderful at her job. They are very, very busy so an appointment is a must! Unfortunately, with my new school schedule they were unable to fit me in anytime in the next 2 weeks and I need my fill done, so I have to find somewhere new that will be able to accommodate my schedule. I'm sorry to leave the place and will certainly be missing it, but it can't be avoided. If you can fit them into your schedule I absolutely recommend them, but it can be very hard to get an appointment if your schedule does not have much flexibility. My rating would easily be a 5 star if i didn't have to go out and find somewhere else due to schedule conflicting. I was just told "sorry about that" when we couldn't find a time that worked for me, and they seemed very unconcerned that I was going to be going somewhere else and they were going to lose my patronage. So if she sees this, sorry to Synthea for leaving you as I know that consistent clients is important, but they couldn't fit me in and didn't give me any alternative.

The coffee is great, the store is fun and unique, but that's not the most important part. Everything on the menu comes in a gluten free option! From all of my gluten free friends I have learned that getting French toast or a waffle is not generally an option. Here at Luci's you can get everything gluten free. Even the bagels and wraps. I absolutely recommend a drop in if you're ever in the area. The produce used in their food is super fresh and high quality too. My breakfast burrito this morning has types of potatoes I didn't even know existed in it.

I went to this nail "spa" this morning because of all the wonderful reviews I've seen. I was severely disappointed. When I hear the word spa I have an expectation of a certain relaxing type atmosphere. This was not the case here by any means. My initial impression when I walked in the door and saw the cluttered semi-chaos going on was that I felt like I walked into a pseudo sweat shop work place. I felt rushed to pick a color and get to my service table. I'm not sure my tech even told me her name at any point. If she did I couldn't hear her over all the noise. Now onto the actual service...  I came in for an acrylic fill since my usual place was booked up for the next 2 weeks. I will tell you right off that I like my nails super short. I work with my hands all day and cannot have them in the way, and use the acrylic to avoid ripping which can scrape my patients. The very first thing she did when she used the tool to shorten my nails was skin my finger. That HURT! I let it go though because I get it, they're short. So on we go. Then she gets to the hard file, and almost immediately I get to say " I think I'm bleeding on your file" she had filled right on the already raw skin and now in bleeding everywhere. She felt really bad, and immediately put some unknown blue substance on it which stung like hell. I have no idea what it was and to a bigger point, what if I was allergic? There was no warning or discussion. I touched through the rest of my service. The polish job is shabby with polish left on my skin. All in all it was a horrible experience and I would never return. I want to give her leeway because of how short I keep my nails, but no one has ever injured me this badly before. The manager was told of the injury, who offered me a whole $1 back on my service cost. I could tell her cared a lot ( heavy sarcasm). My advice is to skip this place. There are plenty of other places around. This is not a spa. It looks and feel just like every other low cost nail strip mall location.

I just went here for morning coffee for the first time. I ordered a hazelnut latte. The service was very nice and all was well, until I took my first sip later in the car. Ewwww. The coffee is completely burnt. This made my usually slightly sweet latte into a nasty bitter mess of disappointment. $4 later I have to throw this away and buy a new one somewhere else. It's completely undrinkable.

It's my first time here and I'm in love! My breakfast sandwich was AMAZING! I will be craving that for the rest of the week, and my coffee was so good I couldn't leave without getting a second one to go. I highly recommend stopping in for breakfast.

Just had lunch here for the first time. I'm very happy. I got the Mongolian beef off of the lunch menu. It came with a bowl of soup, a bit of egg fried rice and a small egg roll. The Mongolian beef was a tiny bit spicy, but since I'm a baby about spice this just means it had flavor. It was delicious. All that food and some hot tea for less than $7 is a win for me every time. I'll be back for lunch again for sure.

I drive by here all the time, and finally stopped in. I'm so glad that I did! The shop is beautiful and clean. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Most importantly the coffee is amazing! I love my coffee and am very picky about it, these guys really know how to make a cup. They also had almond milk for my Latte, which always puts a big smile on my face. I will 100% be back, and probably often.  My Latte cost $5 with the almond milk. Right within the exact same range as Starbucks and Dutch Bros but 1000X better.

I went here based on the high ratings when I was in the area. I am so glad I did. They were very friendly and clean! My nails turned out beautiful in a very timely manner. The pricing was also very reasonable. I would absolutely come here again.

I love this new location! The food is awesome and they always have the best beer choices. The first time I came I had a bartender named Jeanette. She  is so fast and friendly, she's not here this time but I'm sure these other bartenders will be just as good. All together this place is awesome!
