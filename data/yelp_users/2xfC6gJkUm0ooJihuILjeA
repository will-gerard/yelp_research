Best Italian food in Phoenix!! This place is a hidden gem tucked away in Ahwatukee. Once you eat there you will tell everyone you know to go there too.

New ownership, new vibe. Better service. A popular destination for those living in the Tukee Foothills. The food is good, the drinks are cold. The patio view is the best place in Ahwatukee to have a happy hour drink. $1 tacos on Tuesday can't be beat!!

Great house margarita, the pork chimi was soo good I wanted to order another one. The baja fish tacos are better than rubios fish tacos, and the come with smashed potatoes.. WOW.. Those are good. The salt n pepper wings with chipolte ranch were also amazing!! Great nieghborhood atmosphere, great patio view.
