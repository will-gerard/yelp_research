We were really excited to try the new Barrio Queen in Gilbert having been to the Scottsdale location several times. The food, drinks and service have always been excellent in Scottsdale. We arrived at 6 PM and were told the wait was 40 minutes, we went to the bar and had a drink while we waited. Unfortunately the bartender seemed only interested in getting our order done and then ignoring us for the rest of our time there.  The 40 minute wait turned into an hour and five minutes. No problem still, we were enjoying the people watching and a good conversation. We would've loved an appetizer but the non-attentive bartender didn't offer. When we finally got our table we were starving. The waiter was great, attentive and took our order promptly. We had chips, a nice roasted corn appetizer (excellent) and the waited anxiously for our entrées. And we waited and waited and waited. 2 other tables seat after U.S. With larger parties were served before us. Interestingly enough those tables ordered the same entrées we ordered. And hour and ten minutes later our food was delivered. While the server apologized several times he never offered to do anything more, a manager never stopped by to explain what was happening and we were left disappointed with the service of this restaurant.  3 tacos and a carnitas dinner plate took an hour and ten minutes!  The food was good, the rinks were good but the service, customer care and general restaurant organization sucked. I expected a lot better from this place especially for the price.
