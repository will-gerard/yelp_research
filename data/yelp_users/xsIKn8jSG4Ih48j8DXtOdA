These guys are Rockstar's.  I have a beautiful green Modulus funk bass of which the paint was badly chipped after some fools broke into my house threw the instrument to the ground.  Anyway, John and Mark accepted the challenge to restore the bass to it's original speckled luster.  The completed work was nothing less than masterful.  I'm a customer for life.

I don't think ever heard a single person ever say anything bad about this place.  I love it here.  The food is awesome.  Atmosphere is great.

Yay! for AZ Massage Spa.  Hands down (no pun intended) Jesse James Ferrell provides the best massage and body work I've experienced.  The smoothies are awesome, too.  Highly recommended!!!

I love this place.  I really hope it becomes a staple to the downtown scene.  I suppose, in a sense, it already is.  But, as other reviewers have commented, the service this past Friday was atrocious.  We were there this past friday while the Beer and Pancake Fest (?) was going on.  I can only imagine the thousands of dollars being lost by terrible service that was going on behind the bar.    If you guys are going to figure out how to handle a decent sized event like this, please get some pros in behind the bar!  I'll be back because I really want to support the burgeoning downtown scene.  But, I might not stay very long if the drink service doesn't get it's act together.

I definitely prefer to support the locally based economy.  But, $3 for a single cup of black coffee is a little much to ask...  Aside from that, it seems like a very nice little place.

Glad we finally made it over to Bink's.  Another great spot in the hood.  The Sand Dab rocks.  I think that may have been the best fish preparation I've had in ages.  Can't say I was a huge fan of the Foie Gras or the Dates.  But, definitely loved the place.  Also loved the drink presentations.

I'm pissed that Dish has chosen to remove the Sundance Channel from their content.  It's hard enough to get any decent programming for cable or satellite providers.  90% of the content they put out is completely useless to a majority of the population.  I sure as hell don't need 8 shopping channels.  My contract is up in a few months.  I know I'm like a lot a folks in that getting closer and closer to getting all of my content through the internet.  The only thing I would miss from cable or satellite would be live sports.  Netflix, YouTube are awesome.  Those two source alone can nearly replace Dish TV for my taste.  Who's with me?
