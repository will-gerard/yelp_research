Good experience. Nice staff even though our visit was really late. I thought it was weird the drive thru doesn't have a window but I guess that's the whole place. Hot fudge sundae looked and tasted good. This chain place lives up to its reputation. Fast, tasty, and clean.

Tried this place on a busy weekend night. Was seated pretty fast. Basic establishment, no updates and such. Our table ordered a few different menu items.  Teriyaki chicken, fried rice, white rice, beef pho, chicken pho, and a mixed veggie stir fry plate.  Enjoyed everything we ordered! We had 3 toddlers with us and since the atmosphere was loud, we weren't an annoyance.

We visited our family who was staying here and ate lunch with them at the 4th Floor Grill. We had a large group and the waitress was helpful and got all of our orders correct.  I'm writing this review with 5 stars for the sweet potatoe fries and Mac and Cheese. It was a delicious plate of creamy Mac and Cheese with a kick! Loved it!

I love QT but I feel like the maintenance quality has gone down over the past few years. I use to be able to go to any QT and find clean window wash water, litter free parking lot, and not get my shoes all sticky as I'm filling up. I continue to visit QT because of the great variety of drinks. But I'm not impressed with the exterior dirtiness.

Came here for lunch before the "lunch rush". It was clean and we had not too long of a wait.  I feel like some of the menu items are a little over priced. It's nice that everything's charbroiled, gives it a nice flavor. When picking out the topping for our burgers and brats, they don't skimp on the toppings and I thought that was good!

I have 2 young toddlers and eating lunch here was very difficult. Not enough high chairs and staff and other customers seemed inpatient with my children.   Food was so so nothing to rave about. The biggest wow was the yummy cinnamon roll! Next time I'll be getting it to go and just the cinnamon roll.

First time I visited, there's was a friendly older man working there. He was helpful and let me know about the punch card. You pay $10 and get 50 gallons. Not too bad!  It's a dated location but clean and the ice cream variety is good.

We like to go here to pick up a pizza as we are out and about.  If you call ahead it's easy to pick up.  We like to get a 4 topping L pizza: Canadian bacon Bacon Pineapple Jalape√±o  It's really yummy and add dipping sauce for even more flavor!

I found it funny that there are 2 Frys stores within a mile of each other. I've been to both locations often and prefer this location on Mill.  They have a butcher counter, are "remodeled", and have the sushi counter.   My biggest complaint is the smoking area is too close to the front door. If you exit the north double doors your 95% likely to get a whiff of cigarettes in your face. Plus it's weird to see employees out there goofing off or taking their smoke break.    Employees are friendly at check out and the store is pretty clean inside.

I've always been skeptical of car dealerships because of annoying experiences I've had in the past. We came to this location because it was listed as a recommended Toyota location by our car insurance.  When we walked in we were greeted by the friendly staff and helped right away. We had an idea in mind of what we were interested in and the associate was great at explaining options and offered information to give us the big picture.  I'm very happy that throughout the process of buying our new Prius Two, I never felt sales pressure and I never felt mislead!  We narrowed it down to 2 different Prius models and asked for the opinion of the associate. We could tell he had our best interest in mind and really trusted he expertise.  We had a great experience purchasing our first new vehicle and it was because Jerry took the time to explain everything and he was very genuine.  If you're in the market for a great Toyota vehicle, ask for Jerry! He's the man!

Typical cheap pizza joint. I ordered for pick up and my pizzas were ready 5mins sooner than quoted. The flavored crust is always nice to try. We did spicy Cajun and it had a nice kick to it. We also got some ranch and buffalo sauce-- mix them together for dipping-- to add some spicy to our pizza. Just did the medium cheese pizzas for $5 each. Honestly though it'd be nice if they had the pepperoni medium pizzas for $5 too.

This 5 star review is for the Auto Department. We walked in to kill time and decided to get an oil change because our car was due.  I appreciate how the employees gave us an honest estimated wait time.  The oil change was done within the estimated time given and the check out was fast and easy.  Employees friendly!

Very disappointed. Went there on a Saturday night. They said the were down 2 chefs. It took 20 mins to get thru the food line then 35 mins for our food to come out. The food was hot so that's why I gave a 1 star. I'll never visit this place again. I'd rather go to YCs

We like bringing our kids to chick fil a because of the nice family atmosphere. We unknowingly came here on a fundraiser night. Even though it was very busy, the tables were cleared fast and the bathrooms were clean.  I didn't give 5 stars because we were slightly disappoint in the under cooked fries and chicken nuggets. We still are everything up but I prefer when the fries and chicken are crisper.

This place has an old fashioned country cook feel. The gift shop area is great and has a good assortment of items.  The food is decent. Some items are hit or miss but a majority of the time it's good. The buttermilk pancakes are tasty. The grits are always cold and gross. We like the lemonade and root beer in a frozen glass. It's a good place for a large crowd because the food is priced well for the portion and a good variety.

I came to this location and used curb side service. It was easy to order over the phone (even though the hold was longer than 5 mins). I arrived at the mall and didn't know where curb side parking was but found it after asking the staff while calling them to let them know I was there. It didn't take long for my food to come out. My food was hot and exactly what I ordered. I would suggest curbside if you're in a hurry or don't want to deal with the inside experience.

Yum yum yum! Everything we tried was yummy! Lamb gyro, Greek salad, humans, rice, pita bread. All very tasty! Try this place if you're near by. The food is 5 stars. I'd give the service 3.5 stars. It might have just been the night but the 2 women working tonight weren't friendly or attentive. Clean quiet atmosphere.

Fast service and delicious food! I do a lot of take out because I have small children. Ordering over the phone is easy and they have it ready fast! The Greek salad is the best I've had. The yummy white sauce on the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich makes it so good! Also, try the fries, the seasoning is so good! I love Cafe Mix and recommend it to everyone! The staff is friendly too!

Visited this place during the week a couple hours before close. The low lit mood setting made it feel classy and intimate.  Came here for GNO and different items were ordered among the table. Pizzas, salad, burger, cauliflower app, and dessert.  The service was great, the waiter was knowledgable about the menu and pronounced all the food items well. The waiter was attentive and nice. The only thing I can think of was, my water wasn't refilled the whole time I was there. But the great service made up for that. Everything we ordered was full of flavor and unique! It was nice to go somewhere and just order new things. The summer corn pizza was amazing!! Full of spice and flavor and different that any pizza I've had lately.  The dessert was yummy with a delicious lemon curd sauce on the side! This place is defiantly worth a try!!

We came here with friends who have eaten here often. We ate on a Friday night around 7:30. There wasn't a long wait to be seated.  The service wasn't bad. But we had heard about the service being hit or miss. I guess our table didn't need much attention anyways. It helps that they have water jugs on the table. Once you're seated you're only attended to for ordering and clearing dishes.   The food was so good!! We tried Chicken Pad Thai at spicy level 3 and pork Thai fried rice. My husband and I shared and felt full! Good portions.   We would definitely recommend coming here again.

Firehouse's subs are more expensive for the size than most places but you won't be disappointed by the quality! They really put a lot of meat and filling inside each sub.  Today we got the Hook and Ladder and Hero. Both were yummy! I don't suggesting waiting too long though to eat your sandwich! I don't like them saved or refrigerated, I've had soggy experiences.  This location was clean and fast. We waited until after the lunch rush, this location is in a hot spot for lunchtime eating out.

Excellent Service that'd you'd expect from any Costco.  The only reason I gave this location 4 stars was because of the location.  Clean, good variety, friendly staff. Oh ha and the chewing ice machine is a plus!!! I love chewing ice!  This isn't my home location since its further away from me but I like to go here occasionally

Los Fav does not disappoint for basic Mexican fast food. We like it better than most divey Mexican fast food around Mesa. This location is nice because they offer order ahead then just go thru the drive thru for fast service.  I don't like their Horchata. But that's about it.

This is the closet branch to me so I went in because I needed more than what the atm could offer me. There were only 2 tellers and a lead teller. I was 3rd in line and it was a 20 mins wait. No employe greats you as you walk in. This location doesn't have a walk up atm which can be inconvenient sometimes when the drive up atm is backed up. I just felt like they need more tellers early in the day when it's the beginning of the month.

Store not busy on a Friday night. My husband and I changed some things on our plan and added a phone, etc. I asked a ton of times how much our new bill would be with the changes. The lady told me over and over again a $price. I asked her so many times, I could tell she was annoyed. I went in the store 5 days later and found out, while upgrading a phone, that the total bill is way higher than the Friday night lady said it would be.  Not great customer service at all. The 1 star I am giving is for the nice gentleman who helped me the 2nd time I visited the store and he helped me with no hidden surprises when it comes to my new phone bill.

Came here on a Friday night. We were seated quickly which I liked. The atmosphere was family friendly sports bar. There are multiple tvs with sports on. I like how the bar  and dining area are separate.  We ordered 1/2 doz honey hot and 1/2 doz strawberry hot. Wings came out hot but lacked in flavor. I didn't really feel like there was any heat. I couldn't tell which wings were which.  The kids meals for my son was a good portion for the price and the fruit bowl it came with was very fresh!  Zucchini appetizer was my favorite! Not soggy and had a jalape√±o ranch with a nice kick. The service was excellent! Very prompt and the server (I think her name was Madison) was attentive.   If you're ordering wings, ask for a rub or sauce on the side for extra flavor. I tried asiago cheese and it was yummy!

Visited this car wash on a Saturday. The back of my car didn't get cleaned well. My car was dripping water everywhere after going through the dryer. My windows looked horrible after coming here to clean my car. Dried water spots everywhere. The only reason I gave this place any stars is because the bay I pulled into to vacuum had a good suction vacuum.   This is my 4th or 5th time in the last 4 months coming here and every time I'm disappointed in the lack of drying so I will not be coming to this car wash anymore. There are better ones out there that actually clean better and dryer better.

The food is good cheap Mexican food. Dicey for sure. We love coming here! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I've been here multiple times were the cashier is using inappropriate language (not directed at me) while I'm standing there paying for my order. It's unprofessional and rude.  We like to order the rolled tacos, bean and cheese burrito, quesadilla, green chile burrito, carne Assad burrito, and bacon potato and egg breakfast burrito.  Try the food if you're in the area! Just expect a long wait. Sometimes we just call ahead and then the wait time is super short.

So glad to find this gem. In California it was easier to find an acai bowl. I visit the location on Higley more than Tempe. Thrive does not disappoint, all of their bowls are unique and delicious!  My only complaint is how long it takes to get your order. Whether you order 1 or 4 items, it always takes forever to get your bowl.  It's always clean, smells okay, and staff friendly.  Try this place instead of Jamba Juice people!

Everytime we drive in from Tucson, we stop here! It's so good! Large portions! The sides are all tasty! We've never had a bad experience coming to Rudy's. Plus it's nice to get a cute little BlueBell ice cream in our way out for dessert. Did I mention how tasty their bbq sauce is?... It's so yummy!!! Oh ya, and I love the large clean up sink for after!

I'd like to give this place zero stars.  A few months back I visited this place on a Saturday. I sat alone at the counter and was overly disappointed by the lack of customer service.  I had to ask for utensils, I had to ask for water, I had to ask for my order of toast. A customer shouldn't have to ask for these things.  I ordered the chicken fried steak and was very disappointed. The plate was too small and my potatoes were falling off the plate. The eggs were drenched in the gravy making them mushy.   I was also shocked at what happened next to me as I was eating.... 2 younger women sat at the counter next to me. They both ordered some orange alcoholic drink. The waitress gave them their drinks and after 1 women already started sipping on it, the waitress asked to see their ID.  I revisited this location this past weekend for a quick coffee. I waited 18mins for a cup of coffee when the restaurant wasn't even crowded. Poor customer service once again.

Great variety of high quality food trucks! We brought 3 toddlers on a Friday night which ended up being a little difficult. Seating is limited and the area the trucks are in is very congested with all the food truck fans.  It's a unique thing to have such a great turn out of food trucks in one spot. Defiantly try this out if you want something new for your weekend night.

I've been here a couple times for a protein bowl and lemonade. Last night we went there for acai bowls and juice. I like the good portion they give you for the acai bowls. They are so yummy!  I tried the Liver Cleanse juice and it was very good! Tart, and tasted really healthy but good. I like that the juice is fresh!  Outdoor seating is great and it's a very hip trendy atmosphere. I've taken my kids here once but I  prefer to not have my little ones at this place.

This is my go to spot for a car wash! This review is for the self service car wash only.  Every time I've visited, the self serve vacuum suction has been strong and I like that they have air compressor hoses to blow the cracks of your car off.  The sales people aren't pushy.  This is by far the best $3 car wash this side of town.  It's a great 1 stop shop too, drive your car thru for the wash, then vacuum, fill up your tank, and grab a drink for the road. The gas prices are a bit higher here though.

Love this place! I've been here 3x in the past 5 days! My 3.5yr old and 2yr old love it!   At first I couldn't understand the price being $8 for adults but realistically to maintain a place like this, you have to charge everyone. With all the deals out there (groupon, memberships, pogo pass, etc) asking $8 for adults isn't a lot.   We purchased the membership for 4 and I think it's well worth it! It's a great place to visit on a rainy day, hot day, mosquito days, any day!  It's clean, safe, and full of a variety of things to do for young children! I like the variety because it's not like we have this much variety at home!

This is an awful car wash place! I gave 1 star because they offer an air compressor in the vacuum bay and I find that super helpful and unique! I seriously won't come to this location if I'm wanting a clean car. I only come here to vacuum and if I have a towel to dry my car off. The dryer in the wash thing does dry well and the brushes are crap.

This is a good one stop shop alternative to visiting the larger Walmart. Smaller and mainly focused on food/pharmacy items.  The pharmacy has always been really friendly, helpful, and fast for us. I like the drive thru option.  I've had to do some returns here and the staff was friendly and nice.  Pretty clean location!

Came here on a weekday evening and the place was packed. Good sign. I like that this place was accommodating to our large group. Our server (bad with names) but she was the most awesome server ever! Very happy, helpful, and energetic gal! She was great.  I've tried a couple of the shakes and the mint chip is my favorites! It's not overly minty which I like. Everything on the menu is worth trying in my opinion but spread out over many visits.  It's a bit pricey but if you order and share it's not bad for the quality and taste you're paying for.  Loud, nightlife atmosphere.

The first time we tried this location, it took over 25 mins for 2 corn dogs and 2 concretes to come out. It wasn't even busy inside. As we sat in our booth waiting, we noticed ants crawling in from the window seal.  The second time I tried the drive thru and ordered 1 corn dog for my toddler. I ordered this item before, inside, and it was 1.00 + tax. When I ordered in the drive thru it was over $2.00. I don't understand the inconsistency in pricing.  The only plus was the drive thru wait wasn't very long.

This 5 star review is strictly for the sweet crepes!   I tried the Nutella and whip cream, added strawberries! So sweet, light, and worth the try! But like I said SWEET! Perfect dessert for a winter night!  I also ordered the crepe with butter, sugar, and lemon. I was disappointed that the lemon flavor wasn't more but it still was a yummy crepe!

We got the Italian Meats, Hot dog with everything on it, and Burger.  My husband loves the Italian meats sandwich and gets this every time with no disappointments.  My 2 toddlers shared the burger and it had a really good taste and was a good size.  I had the hot dog with everything and it was good but the bun was a little soggy.  The bathrooms were clean and the staff was really friendly!

I've visited the soda shop a couple times. The atmosphere is trendy and the menu is great with a good variety of different mixed soda drinks!  I was nervous to try the Happy Camper but was so happy I did! Also, try an iced oatmeal cookie! They are delicious and worth the trip alone!  I didn't give it 5 stars because the wait is very long every time I go. Sorry

First time visitor. Excited to try a different drink mix! Business has great curb appeal! I tried the regular Dr Pepper "Berry Good Dr" drink and it was very flavor filled! But a bit too sweet for my liking. I think the mixture might be a little off and had too much vanilla and not enough strawberry pur√©e.   Next time I visit in going to try a cookie and a Mtn Dew drink mix!   The drive thru wait wasn't very long which was a plus! But the car in front of me stopped 2x to look at the menu since they post 2 menus at different points of the drive thru. I wouldn't do drive thru if you're in a hurry and there are people infront of you.
