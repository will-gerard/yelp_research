Love this place. The tour keeps me coming back with over a hundred beers to choose from! Food is not the greatest but the atmosphere is worth it.

Horrible place. We purchased a groupn to use and they would not accept it. Their food was average at best and their service was below average. They would not even apologize about the groupon. Their are much better places to eat closer to the strip.

Stopped by because we were checking out the venues for our 2015 wedding and we were hungry. At first I thought the prices were a bit high, we ordered some fajitas, but when we got our dish I was surprised at how much food there was on the plate. It was also very delicious. The service was not too bad either as its pay first then eat. I will definetly come again.

My favorite place to get a comic. The staff there is friendly and always willing to help find a comic.I took my 8 year old daughter and the staff got her very excited about comics and now she is hooked. Thanks to the staff and owner!

I called Elite pool because my 9 month old puppies chewed through one of the pipes and my pool was draining into my back yard. I didnt realize how serious it was until I received  a $500 water bill!!! Damien immediately  replied to my email and was out the next morning to take a look even though I was not in his service area. He quickly repaired the pipe and even redid the chemicals. I was expecting a huge bill and was pleasently surprised when I received his quote. And even moer surprised when I received the invoice that matched his verbal quote. Thank you Damien!

The HOUSE Team was awesome! They were transparent throughout the entire process gicing us regular updates. There was never a time I did not know where we were in the process. Jeremy always returned our calls if we had any questions and was very patient with us.  The process was long because we had the buyer for our home back out a week before closing and we had to cancel the contract a home. We were worried we would have additional fees but therewere none.Now a days lenders are nickel and diming you so it was refreshing to hear there were no additional fees to process through.  Thank you to the HOUSE team!
