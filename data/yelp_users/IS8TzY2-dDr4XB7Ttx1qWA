$59 bucks a night with a free breakfast buffet when mentioning the Travel Zoo promotion? Yes please. (Well plus the daily resort fee that all these places have but still a deal!) So 4 stars for the place as it is because of course there are fancier and schmancier places on the strip.   Ok so it's not on the strip and it doesn't have some iconic show playing in it's theater but the recent renovations make this an excellent place for a nice but affordable vegas trip. A cab to the strip is literally like 5ish mins (depending on traffic) and there's a free shuttle from the resort to Caesar's. But do know that it only runs from 11am-8pm. Goes about every half hour.   Service was awesome! My flight arrived in the morning and the rest of the fam was getting there in the late afternoon. I explained my story and they let me check in at 1030am with no early checkin fee! The rooms have been recently redone and are complete with huge comfy beds and modern colorful decor. The big eyes on the wall are a bit much though lol it's like they are watching you sleep! I think some yelpers have posted pictures.  Buffet is so-so but cheaper than most. Tues/Saturdays are seafood nights I think. People go nuts over the crab legs so go early for better pickings. If you want a great, but pricey, Vegas buffet experience, shuttle over to Caesar's Bachannal Buffet. So so good.   The pool is huge and is perfect for lounging, not too crowded. The place is more family oriented so there's a few kiddos running around but it was still very relaxing. You also have access to the palms place pool (an adult only) via the sky tunnel. It is a more relaxed setting for a more calm and quiet lounging experience. Pool side drinks are ridiculously expensive but it's vegas so that's expected.   POOL TIP: Buy your booze from the little burger joint that has a patio extending to the pool area. It's cheaper and you can bring the drinks pool side.

TIPS: Free valet parking at the stratosphere. After walking in to the building from valet parking, head towards the CASHIER sign and make a right. Go all the way down, pass the poker room and you'll find it tucked away on the left. Also, TravelZoo coupon online, deal ends 9/30/2014.  So I may be slightly biased because we bought the travel zoo coupon and everybody knows that a good deal always seems to make food taste better. Well at least in my family haha Despite the voucher's fine print that limits one coupon per table, the restaurant was more than happy to let us use 2 coupons for our party of four. For $49 you get a soup/salad (specialty salads too, like shrimp caesar, caprese, etc.), an entree up to $32.95 in value (which is basically everything but 2 dishes on the menu), and a dessert to share (any of the desserts on the list.) They automatically added the gratuity which is a percentage of the actual bill price but it still is a pretty sweet deal. First they bring out fresh bread and butter that is sitting on a bed of minced roasted garlic with olive oil. Really yummy. We also ordered some chardonnay- a liter was only $20 so each of use had about 2 glasses which I thought was a good deal.    I ordered the mozzarella caprese (large slices of fresh cheese!), my aunt's chicken caesar was pretty big, and two other had the tomato salad. For our entrees, my dad's linguine with clams was overflowing with shellfish, I had the gnocchi with filet mignon, my step moms lamb shanks comes with about 5 shanks, and my aunt's rib eye was huge. We all were pleasantly surprised. Lastly, we picked the tiramisu and godiva chocolate mousse cake. Yum and yum.  Service was a little slow at first but once we told them we had a show to catch shortly after dinner, they were much more attentive and told the chef so that we could get out of there on time. Overall I think we still saved quite a bit of money, so if you're unsure at least check it out with the coupon to see if ya dig it as much as we did.

So I hardly frequent sandwich shops and going to this place makes me wonder why I don't go more often because this place has reignited my love for sandwich shops! And FYI the line is long for a reason.  All of the sandwiches are hot with a delicious freshly made bread. They have many fun options to try such as hawaiian BBQ, cannonballs (meatball sandwich lol), chicken chipotle avocado, and holiday turkey (complete with turkey, stuffing, gravy, and cranberries!) The prices are reasonable at 5.99-8.00 I think. Yes, more expensive than subway but 5x better.   I got the All American- turkey, cheddar, cranberries, lettuce, tomato, and ranch. Sounds odd but so freakin' good. I want one right now...too bad Vegas is 6 hours away. Poop.

We were looking for something fast so we decided to stop here thinking it would be a quick and cheap stop. I know they have more of these in California and I heard they're pretty popular but after eating here, I cannot find a single reason why.  I don't really like hot dogs (which maybe discredits my review) but my two other friends got hot dogs and nobody enjoyed their food. I got a cheeseburger which are usually hard to mess up. It wasn't burnt or anything but there was absolutely no flavor and the tomatoes were diced and the lettuce shredded. I get that shredded premade veggies may be easier but who puts diced tomatoes on a burger? It made it really messy to eat. And at almost 9 bucks for a standard burger (with no fries or drink) I expected a little more. My friends mushroom dog had mushrooms that tasted old and my other friend got the bacon chili dog. We all got halfway through and looked at each other with dissatisfied faces and tossed the rest. Sadly, I think you'd be better off at a McDonalds.  Oh and to top it off some blaring alarm was going off the whole time and no one seemed to mind it or address to their customers that everything was fine or that it would be turned off shortly. I think it was the fire alarm, Idk lights were flashing and a siren going. I understand that it may have been out of their control, but I think good customer service would have acknowledged it and let the customer know the roof wasn't going to fall in or something like that.

Seriously my favorite part of my Vegas trip was EBC!  Ok I should probably say that this review is probably skewed a bit because of our awesome promoter that we randomly meant on the strip, Richie Palou. He hooked us up with no cover, minimal line, and access to a stretch of several cabanas/day beds to hang at. There was also free mimosas for ladies until 2. In addition, he wouldn't even take my measly 10 dollar tip and just said to enjoy ourselves (but not to say that you shouldn't try)! Such a sweet guy. So with that said, I didn't pay a cover or for drinks so my experience was probably different than for others (especially guys!)  We went on a Sunday (which I was told was the best day to go). And guess who was the DJ...none other than Lil Jon! He was really good too. The place itself has a fun ambience with a lot of palm trees and the cabanas are adorable with red curtains and day beds. The cabanas had balconies that opened up to the street. They also were stalked with towels and glasses. Coat check is only 10 per bag so we just put all of our smaller bags into one big bag and split the cost making it really cheap. The water wasn't murky like others have complained. I would recommend getting there by 12 (1 at the latest). Try to get the hookups if you can but if not I'd definitely recommend this. I enjoyed it much more than a night club- no heels while dancing and get a tan at the same time! :]

Why is it that donut shop owners are just the sweetest? Maybe because they are delivering circular globs of happiness and the sugar just seeps into their blood?   Anyway, I'm from California and was visiting Phoenix with my sisters to meet our newest little nephew whose family lives down the street from Sunrise. We just consumed an ungodly amount of tacos at La Santisima- side note that place is my Phoenix addiction! I have to get a mahi mahi taco every time I'm here (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-santisima-gourmet-taco-shop-phoenix).   Ok, sorry for the fish taco tangent, back to the donuts. My sister who lives here had been telling us about Sunrise and my other sister, who is preggo btw, yells at me to immediately turn when she sees the sign for it as we are driving home. It is literally 7:58pm, meaning 2 minutes till closing, and we are already stuffed to the rafters. Yet I can't help but follow the commanding shrieks. And I'm so glad we did. The girl at the counter was such a doll. We bought a half dozen but she threw in a couple extra since they were closing and she was so personable and friendly. They had a smaller selection since it was the end of the day but our favorites were the cinnamon glaze (there's cinnamon baled on the inside making it taste like a cinnamon roll), the blueberry donut, maple bacon bar, and surprisingly the vanilla cake donut. I prefer cake donuts anyway but this was like a fluffy vanilla cupcake.   My recommendation is start your sunrise with Sunrise :]
