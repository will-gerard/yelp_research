I went for two sessions with Susan. The first, she cut and styled my hair. The second was a dye and highlights! She was fantastic! The customer service was awesome and everywhere I go, I get compliments on my hair! The best part, I got this done for my wedding and I feel confident and beautiful! I'll be coming back here from now on.

I thought I had written a review already, but apparently not. I love Veranda!! The people there are incredibly nice and the variety is good! The food is ALWAYS fresh and high quality.   Usually I determine how much I like a resteraunt by not only how good the food is there, but the variety of foods. If you can order anything off the menu, and it's all made well, it's a good resteraunt. Veranda definately has this quality! I can choose a variety of foods (salad, soup, sandwiches, burritos, breakfast items) and know I'll be happy with the taste!!   My favorites are the croissant delight (club on croissant) and also the salads. They also have a great celery/carrot/PB/crackers/grapes combo thats a nice light option.   They're daily specials are delicious too! My favorite is the orange chicken with jasmine rice. Nice and lightly flavored!   I don't even work near them anymore, but I still visit!

I guess I should have gone to Yelp before dropping off $50 worth of clothes. After being told to drop off clothes unbuttoned, I picked up my suit jackets, dress pants and dress shirts in a hurry. When I got them home, my husband opened them up and the shirts has steam stains around the buttons (big white crescents!!!) These shirts were unusable!!!   I could take them back but this is pretty standard and total blatant disregard for doing a job right. Not going back.

Scheduled an appointment at the expo to just look at dresses. I received a confirmation for Sunday at 12:30 and we went. The experience wasn't that great. We tried both bridesmaids dresses and wedding dresses. I have to give credit to the lady that was assigned to us. She was helpful to the extent she could be. They had obviously overbooked and so the only time she had available was to take our dresses, hang them up, and give us rooms. She was nice but waaaayyyy overworked. We didn't need much help with the bridesmaids dresses, but when it came to the wedding dress, it was difficult because I had to wait to be given different dresses. Not all fit in the tiny room they give you. At one point I had to wait naked for awhile because the corset didn't fit and I had to ask my girls to hunt the assistant down to get a new one. My initial dresses didn't fit just because the large corset underneath, but rather than noticing the pucker, she just clamped me up. At one point I was switching the dresses out myself. I completely blame management for overbooking. On top of that the dress I did want was 'on sale' for $550. With the discount from their advertised sale it would have been $500. Looking online it was available at $500 on their website and a plethora of other websites (so no great deal.) will not go here again or suggest anyone else do so. Will go to another location and definitely a different day of week.

Awesome staff!! They got us in and out quickly! I took my four year old in for his first exam and Dr Brian F was both patient and funny. He determined my son had good vision but astigmatism, so we had to get glasses. They ensured my son had a good size to fit his large head and everything was to our liking. On top of everything, our exam and glasses was covered 100%!! I scheduled more appointments for my husband and I on the spot!! Thank you to the entire staff who was super helpful, nice and patient with me and my small child!!

Love this place. We've been taking our boy here for about 9 months now (since he was born.) They didn't offer services to the hospital I was at (but that should have changed by now.) We tried a majority of the doctors there and settled on Dr Gutman. She's amazing with our boy and very down to earth. The staff here are always friendly and helpful.

This place is awesome. I brought my Dyson in which was dirty and not suctioning. They told me when to call for a quote, and then promptly fixed my vacuum in a week. They were prompt, honest, and courteous. And now my vacuum runs like the first day I bought it!!

So far so good. I went in for an exam. I was a little nervous since it has been 9 years, but I did my research and Glass was not only on my network but had great reviews. The staff immediately put me at ease. I was given the full compliment of x-rays and exams. Dr Glass was super nice and super funny. At the end, I was told what needed to be done, asked my opinion on a few things that "could" be done (like removing my permanent retainer) and then informed of the prices of everything. Needless to say, I'm going back for my work. Very happy!!

I've been going to Dr. Nunnelly for a few years now. The office has always been excellently run as well as the staff extremely efficient and friendly. I love the fact that I can get bloodwork and other stuff done there right on site. In addition to being a dr office, it's also an Urgent Care so I can always get in. Dr Nunnelly has always been right on target with her diagnosis' and resolutions. She found my lack of Vitamin D when no previous doctor had even thought to look! I always refer family and friends to this office!

Ahreum was great! I wanted a wild style but wasn't sure if I could pull it off. It required bleaching all of my hair but wasn't sure if the bleach would take due to an issue with my last stylist. She suggested doing a trial run and it turned out looking great! She did a cut too and I love it!! Will be going back for my wilder style later!

Nipple piercing  I was so nervous to get this piercing and had thought it through for quite some time. I had stopped by Halo a couple of times prior to ask questions, each time they were patience about my questions and never pressured me to do the piercing (they must get it a lot.)  When the day finally arrived when I could wait no longer, I went in there and explained that I just wanted basic jewelry to start with. Once again, no pressure to upgrade. I waited for the person before me to get her belly piercing. Waiting here can be awhile, whether for questions or service, but I'm fine with them taking their time to service the customer correctly then rush through everyone.   I was led back into the room by a colorful New Zealander. She was fantastic. She had me and my fiancee sit while she cleaned and talked. Very clean!! Finally she had me stand while she marked everything and ensured I was comfortable with placement. I was hesitant at first, thinking maybe it was just me, but she could tell I was pondering and kept telling me to let her know. Finally I did, and she readjusted the markings, no problem.   Then the piercing. Yes, it hurt for a second. It hurt a lot. But it was just for a second and she was fantastic getting me to breathe and adjusting. The piercing didn't hurt at all after it was in and the barbells were screwed in.   She explained care and we talked for a little while while they calmed down. I was very happy with this service (as many people on this site!!)  It took me a couple days for them to not ache all the time. It was just a little and slightly annoying. Now its just if I bump them against something.   I'll definitely go back here and refer everyone I know to this shop!!

The BEST thai food place in the valley. I've been to other resteraunts and NONE of them even come close. Our favorite it the Tom Kah soup with chicken with rice. However, we also have had other dishes. We have never had a bad item. The staff is also amazing with frequent check ins and always in a good mood.

Heard about this restaurant in Groupon. Thought we'd give it a try.   Honestly, we fell in love with it. Its extremely tradition, so if you're looking for fancy or updated, this is not the place to go. It's very traditional italian with a mom and pop vibe to it. The wait staff was great!   Warning, if your going to order garlic bread as an appetizer, it's probably going to come out with your main meal. We'd had pasta and pizza here. Very delicious!!!

Great price for what you get. Everything is clean, the rooms are a little stuffy, but running the air conditioner it helps immensely. The people and customer service are awesome!!!! We were only here a day and most of the staff knew us by name. We decided to stay for Super Bowl because not only are the rooms a great price, but the food and drink too!! 6.99 for a decent prime rib dinner, 3.00 for drinks, and 3.00 blackjack. Will definitely come back.

Absolutely delicious!   We went here for a pre-wedding dinner the night before. We love Thai and wanted to compare to our local favorite.   I liked the Tom Kha Gai. The hint of lime was refreshing.   We also tried several others dishes. We asked for medium spicy but I felt like it wasn't that spicy. However, it was still best Thai food (aside from our usual local favorite) we've tried! We'll definitely come back!  One small note, come when your not rushed for time. Our waiter and food took a little bit longer than we're used to, but it wasn't a problem.

We were married this past weekend and decided to splurge and get two two-bedroom tower suites. The price was about half the rest of the suites we looked at and we were incredibly happy!  The suites were gorgeous! Large and clean and beautiful! We had California king beds in both rooms. This was large enough to fit three people in one bed comfortably if your having more than four people with you.   The beds were incredibly comfortable! And the room service fantastic! The only problem we had was dealing with the elevators. It required a key card to go up and so you had to ensure you always had a key card with you. At one point our family and wedding photographer got stuck in the elevator, but they gave us room credit and it was nice that the hotel responded so favorably. Any issues we had were promptly resolved and without hassle.   We also went to the Love show. It was a lot of fun and I would definitely suggest it for anyone staying at the hotel. The grooms party went to the Brazilian steakhouse and it was delicious!   All in all we loved this hotel!!! Everything was handled smoothly (and if it wasn't, we were appropriately compensated for our hassle) and everything was quality.   I think this is my new favorite hotel on the strip!

Love, love, love this place!!!  We found it for our wedding reception, so we decided to make a special trip and try it out beforehand (our wedding is in Oct 2014.)   I was a little worried about sound and saltiness from other reviews but neither were an issue. The entertainment was perfect and perfect volume. We tried 6-7 different dishes and fell in love with all of them (with the exception of the pot roast which was a little tough, but when we asked to sample some pork roast because we were trying to decide buffet options, the chef complied and it was amazing!)  The server, Olga?, was awesome! We had a couple of our party paddled for ordering shots and it was so much fun! The entire hall gets in on the fun! (And it was kind of nice that they don't do the whole...we're gonna get hot women to do paddling...it's normal servers with an awesome attitude!)  My fiancée loved it so much, he's already declared that for ALL our annerversaries in the future, we'll be revisiting.   Can't wait to party it up in October!!!

We had our wedding reception here. We had about 30 people and it ended up being buffet. The food was wonderful and the staff were prompt and nice! The pork roast was amazing and so tender!!!!  Originally we requested the beer hall, but it was insane being Oktoberfest, so they moved us to the gardens. I actually think this was a better idea and they gave us a big screen tv to watch the festivities in the beer hall.   Due to a family issue, we initially had 58 people we contracted for, but it ended up being 31 people instead. Although the contract was written that we would lose money on guests 31-48, they offered us some options that made us feel a lot better about our experience.   I would definitely suggest this restaurant for large groups and wedding receptions. It was so much fun!!  Big thanks to Karen K who helped us arrange everything!

We had a wonderful time at the chapel! We requested a special theme of our own....Spaceballs.   Yoan contacted us early on and was very prompt and clear with his instructions on what we could or could not do and what the charges were. We made our deposit and continued to talk with him regarding plans. We had a wonderful experience but there were also a couple of things that could have been done a bit more efficiently...  Pros: - Super fun! The officiant dressed up like Yogurt and did a great job at making the ceremony fun!  - The chapel was a great layout. Loved the smoke and the entire ambiance of the church. The way they introduced Yohgurt was awesome! - They accommodated our larger than normal party.  - All of the staff was super nice.  - Limo was on time and super friendly!  Cons: - If you have a fairly large party (more than 10, we had about 30), there is no place to wait other than outside. There is no place for large seating, so most of us were standing in the sun.  - She asked what names we go by. We stated several times it was Ricky (not Richard), but the name still came up as Richard.  - There was some confusion as to what we requested in regards to officiant. I talked to Yoan a lot about the officiant situation (we had our own but was told we also had to pay for theirs). We were told their officiant would work with ours to create a ceremony, but that never happened. When we arrived, we were asked repeatedly if we were having our officiant or theirs do the ceremony. It took some time to resolve it and honestly the staff we talked to never really listened to what we needed. However the officiant (Yohgurt), was amazing and fixed everything!!! He really saved the day!! - I didn't realize that the live feed was not included in the package. We had to pay another $25. The guests saw it but I can't see the 30 day archive yet on our page.   All in all, it was a great experience! I don't think any other chapel would be able to pull this off!!! The officiant was fantastic, but I think their support staff needs better organizational processes for details.   Thank you so much Viva for making a memorable wedding!

Surprised no one has reviewed this location yet. I have just started my little guy here. We had an introductory class and then finished our first paid class. The staff are extremely nice and attentive. The facility is clean and the program fun for the little ones. My son is 2.5 and in the "Beasts" class. They all seem to have fun and get along well. I also have my MIL take him to the open play times during the week and she told me that the staff has been great during those times as well. So far we're happy!

Hubby has some pain, so we scheduled him in a few days time. I found this dental group because the hours were a little later, which we needed with hubby's special hours during this time of the year. They x-rayed and diagnosed him within 20 minutes and even offerred to do the extraction right then and there, but we had to go out of town. Will go back tomorrow to finish the job. Very impressed!   They didn't take x-rays of the whole mouth, but I imagine they just wanted to focus on the trouble area for now.

Called Cole about my a/c being put and he said they'd take a look. It ended up being a major repair because of something I ran over, but he suggested calling my insurance and essentially saved me $1500. On rope of that my warranty covered my battery that was running down and the filters on my engine and a/c. My brake pads were down to nothing but I knew that so had term fix it and my wipers which were a decent enough price. On top of everything it was supposed to take four hours for diagnostics and repair, it took two and he gave the car a wash! You guys are awesome!!

I have to say I'm a bit surprised by the other reviews. A friend an I went for lunch. We were seated right away and had excellent customer service the entire time. The black bean soup was amazing as well as my mushroom Swiss burger. Well done yet juicy and flavorful.  My friend had the chicken tacos an side salad and she was as equally impressed. Will definitely go here a again.

Hmmm, in reading these reviews it seems the issue isn't that they're bad, it's that they're inconsistent. Our group got four cupcakes. I got vanilla and banana, my SO got an Irish Baileys, and my friend got the chocolate and marshmellow. They were so bad and dry we didn't finish them. Was horribly disappointed. I've had cupcakes from "Let Them Eat Cake" when a friend went there for her wedding and "Sugar Daddy Cupcakes" and they both were supremely moist and delicately flavored. Never again and I was so looking forward to these cupcakes.

We went today (a Saturday) at about 12 pm. We got seated really quickly for an 8 person party. The area we were directed to was one closed on room with bench seats, so everyone had to scoot in.   The wait staff were very nice. And although, it was the weekend, we still got lunch specials.   The chips were warm and the salsa was delicious! Everyone was happy with their food. Even though it was lunch specials, the portions were huge. I got a taco salad with chicken, but the chicken overpowered the salad. It was more chicken than salad. But still very good.   Definitely will go back again!

The staff seemed really stressed out and not partcilarly warm. We had a 8 person group. However, it took a little while to order. When I asked for rye bread with my burger, I was informed that the options were buns. Then that they did not have rye bread, so I asked for wheat instead. Two of us ordered burgers and weren't asked how we like it. The order took forever and drinks were slowly refilled. Once the orders came we learned that one person couldn't get their full order because they were out of the pancake bites, one person didn't get their seasoned fries (only regular), one person didn't get their pancales for another half hour and it came with no butter. Water wasn't refilled. It was just a mess all around.

We went for a bachelorette party on a Saturday night. Unfortunately, we were the only group there, but we got a lot of attention from the male dancers. The show was definitely entertaining and most of the dancers were having fun with it. The club looked really nice but we didn't stay longer as we had a checklist to complete. Would definitely consider coming back! The staff was super nice too!

This Enterprise location has been awesome! We've used them several times. Both for short-term and long-term rentals when our car has been in the repair shop. They always have a car available, never hassle you, and are very good with last minute extensions or changes in time renting. We will continue to use them even though they are not in our area since we moved anymore (we attempted to use a couple of other Enterprises and they were horrible!)

All within 7 days!! It looked gorgeous and I wasn't even charged a rush fee!  Will definitely be going back!

Rons been great! He has been to our house twice now for unrelated issues. The first time he had to cut out roots from our plumbing. The second time he snaked our lines out to the alleyway. Each time he responded quickly, ensured everything was working smoothly, and was extremely affordable. He's our go to plumber now!

I've been looking for a good cupcake company after a horrid experience at Sprinkles. Knowing I had been craving a good lemon cupcake with a light taste, my boyfriend got four cupcakes here after I gave birth to our son. I loved them but for very specific reasons:  - First of all I'm not a big frosting fan, so it's nice to actually have a place that doesn't mask the taste of it's cupcake with massive amounts of frosting. The frosting that was there was delicious.  - I do not like a heavy flavor in my cupcake and that's what Cupcakes by Design provides. The lemon cupcake had the exact amount of lemon flavor I was craving for months. The cherry was perfect. I love the fact that their banana cupcake IS NOT a banana muffin texture (like some other places). And my boyfriend loved their peanut butter cupcake.   - They have a good variety of cupcakes and the fillings are good as well, but not necessarily needed.   We'll definitely be frequenting this place.

We went for a bachelor/bachelorette party dinner. We had about 19 people and they accomodated us well. Since everyone had different palettes, this seemed to be a good option. Tons of different foods, all delicious and some exotic. Very well displayed. And they dessert was just right as it was tiny servings. We also had a person who was Gluten Free and they actually walked her around and showed her the various options. The customer service was great and management was very flexible with us and paying. Thank you!!   PS Vladamir was our server, he was great!

The staff were really nice however our satay was very dry. The dipping sauce was good. We also ordered mixed meat with peanut sauce (which just tasted like melted peanut butter) and the yellow curry with beef (which ended up with a shrimp in it.) Not too bad, however not that great either.

Ambiance is highly misleading to the food. We got a groupon here and were highly skeptical when we arrived. We started with the chips and salsa which were suprisingly amazing. The salsa had fresh garlic and cilantro. Then on to the main course...I had the tacos, pork and chicken which were on flour tortillas with almost a pita feel to them with a special light sauce and fresh cabbage. My friends ordered the burger which was stuffed with cheese and served on an asiago ciabatta bun and the gamechanger which had mutliple meats and served on asiago bun as well. The food was beyond amazing and we'll be going back again.

Called to schedule a rental and was told one was available. Was called 30 minutes later to be told there was nothing available. When I called the next closest location they told me they couldn't pick me up because there was a closer location. I got the run around from both of these locations. Went back to my usual location. Although farther away, they are much more dependable.

Love this place! My son has been going since he was 6 months old. He's been primarily with Lindsay, but also has spent some time with Jayden. Both have been amazing instructors. When my son was a little too young for the next class, but ready physically, Lindsay took a chance and tried him out. Although he had some difficulty, she had faith in him and in three sessions, he's made remarkable improvement in staying on the bench and listening to directions (a big leap from being in the pool with mom and dad.) He loves going so much and the rest of the staff, including the manager Brittany, ensure to remember the children's names as well as say hi and talk to them. Well worth the membership fees (which really aren't that much per session.) Thank you aqua-tots!

This is the second time I've come here in about two years...honestly, I don't know why I don't come here more often! By far a superior cupcake. My son got the strawberry "Princess" cupcake. It was moist and delicious! I got the chocolate cupcake and it was a chocolate cupcake SHOULD taste like. Very chocolatey! And the people running the store were very attentive and patient as we tried to figure out which 8 cupcakes we wanted!! Also their boxes to go are awesome! They keep the cupcake straight and not wobbly and there is finger divots to easily pull the cupcakes out.  Coming here more often for sure!!!   BTW, their gluten free cupcakes are awesome as well. I hope when I go back they'll have sugar free ones for me to try.

I got the dozen minis and a gluten free cupcake for my friend. She LOVED the GF cupcake. She kept asking me over and over again if it really was GF (I assured her there was a GF sign poking out of it when I purchased it.)  The mini cupcakes were delicious, but half the cupcake was frosting (and I'm not a big frosting fan.) The cupcake itself was delicious and moist. The frosting was okay. Did not taste completely natural/fresh, but still good. I'd still go here over Sprinkles anyday!

Let me start by saying my girl was extremely nice! The customer service, was really good. However...  My hair style was good, just not that great. It took her about 15 minutes to curl and style my hair. I also asked for makeup. It was good, and I could tell the girl knew what she was doing and once again super nice, but I guess I was expecting something a bit more dramatic.   My friend was a bit more disappointed. I could tell the girl servicing her was a little newer and not as experienced (but yes, super sweet.) It took her awhile with the hair and she was a bit inexperienced with makeup. My friend is a performer and expects a very professional application of makeup. The girl did not know how to do lashes and completely skipped contouring although my friend mentioned it a few times. Didn't even say anything about it.   Like I said the girls were extremely nice but unfortunately I feel like the over $100 for the style, makeup and lashes just wasn't worth it.

My fiancee and I were actually looking for an ATT store when we saw this place. We decided to stop in and fell in love immediately! First of all I'm astonished that I can get a dozen specialty donuts for about the same price as a dozen regular donuts anywhere else. The donuts were so amazing, that when we're coming back to Vegas to get married, THIS will be our Bridal Party's breakfast day of! Can not go to Vegas without getting these fabulous donuts!!!   BTW, fruity pebbles was my favorite. Although ALL of them were horrendously scrumptious. I would say don't scarf down a whole bunch of different ones at once, it ruins the experience and flavor. Kind of like smelling different scents, you need a coffee break in between. lol.

This place is amazing!!!   We had been here before, so I arranged to get three dozen gourmet doughnuts for the morning of our wedding.   First of all, the price for a dozen "gourmet" doughnuts is insanely good! About $15. Did I mention that they are gourmet? And amazing!   Second, I had asked the owner if they had a butter pecan doughnut. He said they didn't but would make it just for us for our special day!   When I arrived, he was incredibly nice! He had the order day mixed up but you couldn't tell. They just packed up the dozens of doughnuts. He apologized for not having the butter pecan doughnut, he couldn't get the recipe right when he tried earlier in the week. I however explained that the butter pecan wasn't necessary and he through in another dozen donuts. Then he kindly helped me into my van with them, as I had a rambunctious three year old with me.   This is the second time I've been here and each time it's just been amazing! Thank you!!

We've been here several times. Both as a large party and small. The service was so slow. At first we thought it was the size of our party but when we e been back as just a party of two, the service was still horrendously slow. The food wasn't good enough to warrant the slow service and price. We stopped going here.

We've passed by this place a dozen times, and I finally got to try it out when we had a family dinner at our house. I was craving gyros, so I called to ask how much a big platter of gyros was. The owner was extremely nice. Both he and the cook ensured that we had a great meal. They gave me directions for reheating (as I was needing the food for Sunday, but they were only open Saturday for pickup.) Everyone loved the gyro meat. He even put together salad and pitas to go with it. It was a great price too for feeding 10 people!!! We've gone back a few times. :-)

I haven't even received the photos yet, but my fiance and I were so impressed, I just couldn't wait to review her! She showed up immediately dove into taking some great shots (I know because she kept on excitedly showing us all the photos she took on her camera!) my three year old was so excited and she kept sharing the photos with him, letting him take photos with her, just amazing with him the entire time! She was just as happy and excited to share our special day and was patient with any waiting we had with some party members. The whole experience with her was just amazing!! And her pricing was fantastic! Everyone loved her! Thank you so much for making this a great experience!!!!

We were given free wristbands to get in the door. The person who gave it to us was super nice, and when we entered the place looked nice, but empty (we were there early though.) However, we got two drinks (vodka and diet coke and a lemon drop shot.) Both drinks were hideous. The worst I had ever drank. We left immediately. If this place had better drinks we definitely would have stayed later. But we didn't even finish the drinks we had.

Our personal service was excellent. The valet was super sweet and remembered us each time we came. We had emailed our interest in a 2007 Saturn Sky with extremely low mileage. Ron immediately responded and answered all of my questions. He worked at getting us the best deal and Mercedes got us out the door quick with signing papers. Everyone was actually super nice which was unexpected at a scottsdale dealership. Thank you Ron!!!
