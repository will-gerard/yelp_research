They are now inside AZ International Marketplace.  The food is great!  The pricing is exceptionally reasonable.  Great street tacos.

If I could rate 0 stars, I would.  The "rush" was three orders.  My order wasn't even dropped, though there were 6 people behind the counter.  The lobby was a mess... Sticky shit on the floor, crumbs and other meal remnants on tables, and all the trash cans were overflowing.  The manager who took our order didn't even work at an acceptable pace.  Not even a faked smile or enthusiasm.  With having worked as a food service manager for 15 years, this place needs to hire an entirely new crew and start over.  I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone.  To add, once home, our order was incorrect.

The daytime bartender is great.  Very attentive and hospitable.       Once it's shift change....leave.  The night person was the complete opposite.  The service sucked, we couldn't keep her attention long enough to order, she only openly noticed us after we stood to leave....  The only reason I'm not giving 1 star is for the initial service when we walked in, before the day shift bartender last.

So far I've come here twice, and it's been great.  The service is very cordial.   I drive a hearse, which falls under the limo price, but I believe it's worth it here.  The crew had a better attention to detail that others I've been to.  I strongly recommend them.

I have always loved Chili's. Being Texan, I guess chili is almost a genetic necessity.  lol.  As with most Chili's, the service is great. I am very disappointed that the walls are virtually naked. The Chili's I am used to going to in Dallas, Texas, have what some would call an over abundance of decor... Pictures from the innumerable Texas Chili Cook-offs, and random fun memorabilia from who knows where, to create a terrific atmosphere. All-in-all, I shall give 3 stars. If they choose to add more, so that it is on par with other Chili's, I shall re-rate this one with 4 stars.

The one time I came here for myself, my Arizona Brown spider bite was diagnosed as a staff infection. Either way I would have gotten antibiotics, but the misdiagnosis turned me off from this hospitals expertise, especially after a friend who is an army medic and an EMS team diagnosed it right.

Always nice to come to this location. The staff is friendly and professional. If you get to the back, overall the best one to "stick" you, is Alexa.

I did a search for somewhere new to try the other week, and have returned here three times since.  The food and service is amazing.  It has the feel of an older diner, and the old familiar service to match.  The food is superb.  I only wish they were open later, to grab dinner on the way home.

I went here last Saturday night. My first time. I have to admit, the burgers are among my top 5. Amazing!  I shall definitely be returning and am more than happy to recommend them.

This store has an amazing selection, and the people are very helpful and welcoming.  With them bringing back Hangover Hoagies, I can give no less than a perfect rating.  The Hoagies are the best I've found since moving away from Philadelphia.

The idea of flavored crust, is great. The problem, is the pizza is dry. It's like eating cardboard. Atop thus, the toppings are barely there. No, I did not get the $5-one topping pizza. I cannot in good conscience, recommend this to anyone.

Okay.  I gave it another try.  Not sure if there were new people this time or what; however, I did find an improvement.  I would like to try the flavored crust with a stuffed crust.  I would go back, based upon this last visit.

Two out of three times that I've gone here, I have been shown there is a reason why I stopped going here.      This time, I will just say, don't order online.  I was charged online, and had to pay when picking it up.  I was too tired to bother with another food source, but this is b.s.  If I am refunded one, when the charges clear, I shall amend this review, but as it sits I am keeping the warning up.

Papa John's is always a great tasting pie; however, they're still very reserved on the toppings compared to their competitors.  A little more generosity would bring them up to 5 stars, for me.

The best service I've had at a Subway. All the staff is terrific, save one. The atmosphere is extremely inviting as are the staff. I recommend going during the day time, to get the best experience. David's extremely loud greeting lets you know you have been noticed. It may sound militant, but you get used to it, and realize it is truly a warm welcome. Debbie, the manager is nice and personable. A little stressed, but that is expected with the volume of her store.    The only reason I am not giving five stars, is one employee. James, is his name and he usually works evenings. He is rude, disrespectful and creepy towards the women, and truly belongs away from a college campus.    In closing, aside from the one drawback, I'd have given it a five star rating.

Usually this is great. Recently I have been standing at a stop, and the asshole driving honks and points back to the last stop, as if the Orbit schedule I am standing at does not indicate I am at a stop. This getting to be bullshit. For info purposes, I was passed up by a Mars, this time.

Passed up, again, by an empty bus. I was at a stop. For the most part, I am happy with the service; however, if the bus is in service and is almost empty, the drivers need to stop for people whom are standing at a stop and flagging them down. It has happened once from a Mars and twice for a Jupiter.

Always terrific service. No addition charge for extra flavoring. The prices are even better than "Starbuck's".

They're back!!!!  I am so happy that Hangover Hoagies has returned.  The service is, as always, very hospitable and friendly.  The food, as before, is amazing.  The best sandwich place in the valley. IMO.

The best service of any convenience store. This one is on par, for me, with Carleton Ave Grocery (Georgetown, WA). (Check my other reviews)

The food and service is amazing.  The best burritos I've had, with the best prices.   With the addition of alcohol to the available products, it just makes this place even better.

The best pub in America. The atmosphere is truly inviting, as true pubs are.    As for me, my favorite bartenders are Brandon and Tina. They are the best. The place is spectacular. It keeps to the pub fashion till about 10pm. Then they redress it a bit for the young college partiers.    The food is devine and the selection of drinks is superb.    All-in-all, five stars is a severe understatement.

A gamer heaven.  The selection and pricing are both terrific.  Very friendly and helpful service.  I have a SNES and PS2, and the game selection is amazing.  The store is perfect for the old school gamer.  :-)

I absolutely love Asian buffets.  This one takes the cake, as it were. The variety, freshness, and overall food and atmosphere is amazing.  The price is a bit high, but well worth it.

Terrific. The pizza is close enough to when I lived in Philly, and the flavored crust is great. The chicken is great, I tried the hot.

NO!  I've been here since 2012.  I admit to staying cause they were cheap for what you got.  The whole time I've had to have my own exterminator come in. Who by the way worked.  This place is full of infestations.  The staff is incompetent at best.  Any work orders for maintenance are ignored.  I have had to do most of the repairs myself, if I cared to have them done.  I have an old unit and have seen the new ones...not worth it at all.  The price is going up almost twice what it was, and for basically no more than a coat of paint.  lol.  It's a shithole.  If you've a choice, go somewhere else.

This location, I hope, is the only one that's this bad.  When we came in, we were seated quickly; though the welcoming atmosphere was missing and staff demeanor was not very friendly.  Our server kept apologizing about us having to wait over an hour for our food, when the "busy night" didn't happen till after we ordered.  Even then, a few tables coming in after us, were served up to 15 minutes before us....      The previous incarnation of Chili's around there (the old one at University and Mill) was terrific, never a complaint.  Too bad I can't say that for this one.....       Now, this is more personal preference; though I preferred the old decor.  The odd collectibles from around the country and different Chili cook-off's.  I'm not too keen on the "modern" look.  It comes away from what many associate with Chili's.
