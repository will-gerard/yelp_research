This is my go to place to sit, have a dinner salad, and watch sports on flat screen.  Service is very friendly, sometimes a little robot like.  Seared ahi tuna salad is my salad of choice at Houston's.  Yum... I will be back.

Just a friendly local coffee joint very near to the main business area of Kierland.  No one bothers you and could be a nice location for a clandestine meeting.

Do not let the strip mall, small location deter you from visiting this sushi place.  We just went with a huge assortment of sashimi with a sprinkling of grilled mackerel and edamame.  For being in the Scottsdale area right of the 101, the sashimi was very fresh and we got the insider hookup for wasabi.  This place is a keeper.

Locations everywhere.  This location happens to have a very efficient and friendly staff.  They have made improvements in having enough staff to handles big lines in the morning.  Bagels are fresh.  Nice combination of service and food.

My buddies and I were starving after watching the Ohio State/Northwestern.  Someone in our group suggested this place.  I had misgivings about a possible tourist trap right on the strip.  I was wrong.  We had a very good server.   We had some pretty good chicken wings.  I had the BBQ brisket sandwich.  Maybe I was hungry, it did turn  out to be a terrific sandwich.

I really need to spend more time in Scottsdale.  This local joint is friendly and unassuming.  My colleague and I just had coffee.  If this was just the daily blend, everyone who comes here is spoiled.  The coffee was rich and delicious.  I look forward to my next visit.

I really should not be eating any sushi in Arizona.  I blame myself for thinking that is was possible to get good sushi in Arizona.  Staff was fine.  It just did nothing special.

Please...no matter whatever the location, the service is always friendly.  Burgers and shakes are very solid.  The burger is a little better when it is done animal style.  I usually alternate between strawberry and chocolate flavors for my shakes.

Do not go here.  My buddies and I went to get a quick bite after the Ohio State/Northwestern game.  We were sat down pretty quickly.  That was it for positive interaction with the staff.  We tried several times to flag down staff to just get drinks and order food.  After waiting for almost 15 minutes, we just walked out. Brutal experience.

Below average for a steakhouse in Las Vegas.  Popcorn shrimp was fine.  The sirloin sears on a hot stone was ok.  That fad is gone.  The wedge salad was decent, nothing special.  I had their "signature" tomahawk bone on ribeye.  Pretty average.  I think it was choice, not prime. The steak was pretty rough.  I did not pick this place.  Disappointing.  The server actually forgot ask for my drink order.  No more future visits.

I have been here several times.  I had the wagyu beef burger.  It was almost as good as the first time I ate this burger.  I ordered it medium rare.  It was served the right temperature, but for some reason it was not juicy.  It needed a bit more fat in the meat.  I also had onion rings.  Just excellent.  The star of the meal was the black and white milk shake.   Completely awesome!  Service was very quick and friendly.  This will not be my last visit.

It does look like the typical Scottsdale hangout for snowbirds.  It is.  Mick, our bartender was extra friendly and added a non pushy way of getting us to eat his favorites on the menu.  We started off with the grilled artichokes with aioli.  We then shared the Thai Kai salad and the the grilled salmon.  The salad was very tasty.  I only ask that they ease up on the wonton strips throughout the salad.  The grilled salmon was perfectly prepared.  Medium rare.  Not too many psuedo chain restaurants can do this correctly.  We ended with the carrot cake.  Nice way to finish a solid experience.

Really nice discovery by one of my cousins.  It is just a really nice breakfast place off the strip.  I had the ham and cheddar cheese omelette with home fries.  Really tasty.  I also had the biscuit with a side of sausage gravy.  Excellent.  I am a big fan of simple food, being well prepared.  Service friendly and quick.

This was first visit to Las Vegas in five years.  Just during up in cab to the location was pretty impressive.  The lobby was pretty amazing.  Incredible architecture.  The curtains in my room opened to a fantastic view of the property.  I loved my room.  It was nice have to finally have an excellent room after being stuck in business hotels for what has seemed like months.  The question is not if I will be back, but when...

I really liked the salad menu selections.  I picked out the Emerald Spinach Salad based on how good it looked when it was being served to another customer.  I believe it is a fantastic way pick out lunch.  Very nice combo of spinach, Gorgonzola, strawberries, pecans and grapes.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I will be back.

If you want a sports bar and Chicken Wings, this is your place  Service is terrific.  One can get Chicken Wings prepared any way and whatever size they want.  Not healthy, but yummy.

I was pretty disappointed with food.  I was guilty of believing the hype off of Yelp reviews.  I was looking forward to more big city, Cantonese or Shanghai style place.  It is not.  More of a comfort food sort of presentation.  We ate this fresh veggie salad with home made noodles.  It had a strange after taste that I could not determine the ingredient.  The flat beef dumpling was a little tasteless.  The stir fried green beans was decent.  The regular dumplings were average.  The strange taste from the veggie was the deal breaker.  The service was fast and nice.  This place needs to make adjustments.

Just a really nice old school ice cream joint.  The staff was very nice and they also sold some old school candies I have not seen in years.

Really a pleasant surprise.  It is located right in downtown Las Vegas.  It a very detailed museum of the mob from the Las Vegas point of view.  I have been a follower of the mob for years.  The museum was really detailed on the Kefauver hearings.  Really informative and logically set up.  Check in on Yelp and get a discount.

I am originally from Chicago and was in the Phoenix area last week.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that Potbelly's had opened locations in the Phoenix area.  I had been visiting the original Potbelly's location on Lincoln Avenue for years.  Of course I ordered an extra beef with everything no hot peppers, barbecue potato chips and a oreo shake.  It did no disappoint.  It completely reminded me of home.  Well done.

I liked the risks they took with the menu.  The chef did a really nice riff on the Hawaiian dish poke.  The salad was very good.  Nice mix of different greens and well dressed.  Just enough dressing to coat the leaves.  My favorite dish of the night was bone marrow.  The serving was huge and just absolutely yummy.  The last dish was the pan sauteed white fish over couscous.  Pretty delicious.

I have to admit I am biased.  I have been going to Potbelly's for over 20 years.  It started at the first Potbelly's in Chicago over 20 years ago.  I do make a point to get the roast beef, double meat, everything, no peppers, extra mayo and mustard.  Also having BBQ potato chips and a root beer helps with the experience.  No matter the location, Potbelly's never disappoints.

Let's be clear, I have been going to the original location on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago since the early 90's.  I just ordered the roast beef, extra meat, with everything, no hot peppers and also extra mayo and mustard.  BBQ chips with a root beer.  It was made just how I remember it from years ago.  Just terrific!  Of course, I finished with an Oreo milk shake.  Great finish.  I cannot wait for Potbelly to open on the west side...
