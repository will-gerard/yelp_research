This is not good sushi, do not waste your time or money. I am a sushi fanatic and this can not even be classified as mediocre.

The level of customer service offered at this Fletcher's exceeds that of the other 3 Fletcher's in the Mesa valley. After having called Friday and learned that Fletcher's only excepts walk in oil changes on Saturdays I showed up bright and early at 8AM at my nearest Fletcher's and was told they were already booked. Disappointed, I called the next nearest location...they mentioned they were short staffed and not taking any oil change appointments. At this point it was nearly becoming comical, I called another location in a neighboring city, rejected once again and it is not even 8:30AM yet, I was frustrated to say the least. I had pretty much given up on Fletchers and the possibility of getting an oil change and was about to head over to the nearest Jiffy Lube when a while later my husband mentioned he believed there was another location a little farther but still within the area. Deflated, dissolved and expecting another turn away I called. Nick picked up the phone, mentioned they were in fact booked up as well (which was actually believable at this point as it was late in the afternoon). However, when I mentioned that seemed to be the Fletcher's theme that day he became very concerned, asked me the circumstances and requested that If I was able to come down he would address my car immediately. Shocked and almost expecting that my leg was being pulled I decided to ride the stroke of luck out. It was totally legit, walked in, spoke with nick, handed him my keys and he kindly said "your car will be next." Wow, above and beyond customer service at its absolute finest. All I can say is thank you, this location successfully performed what every other Fletcher's in the valley had horrifically failed at ( no not just a simple oil change ) but the type of customer service that has become a thing of the past. Thank you!

Sad!! The talent and creativity of their sushi chefs is unfortunately trumped by the horrific customer service due to lousy wait staff. The rolls here are creative, fresh, funky (sometimes too funky, i've had a weird choice or two that i would not choose again) and overall pretty good. But if their paying customers continue to be neglected during their visits they will inevitably fall due to low scoring reviews. My review score is based solely on the horrible service provided by their waitress last week.

We were excited to visit this sushi restaurant. Unfortunately our stomachs were turned as we witnessed the sushi chef bare hand slap the small cockroach that had begun crawling across the glass case in front of us at the sushi bar. Nothing was said, no apologizes were made as we ask for our check, paid for what we hadn't even touch and left.

My advice. Go with the fresh brick oven pizza, the sausage was succulent, the ricotta sweet and the crust perfect. The Sicilian style pizza I can not say the same for, it is a generic cheese thick crust already baked up an when someone orders toppings they simply slap them on and reheat the pizza with the toppings. Leaving the crust overly crisped like biting into a crouton and the toppings only slightly warmed. Anything that is made to order is a winner! Anything Pre made and waiting such as sides, sicilian, cake can be skipped without missing much.

This restaurant is quality in every aspect! I walked in the small front door and was greeted by a sweet hostess who did not lose her composure when I stated i would be dining alone (the single diner always throws serving staff and hostesses a slight curve ball to test their reaction and with family and friends all out of down I was flying solo!) she offered me the option to sit inside or outside and I choose the fresh air option. It was a quiet little patio area and they have done a beautiful job making it feel warm, inviting and romantic. I can not even describe how fantastic my waitress was, Joanne I believe was her name (I'm sorry, I'm horrible with names) she was bright and cheery, made fabulous suggestions and quick accommodations to recommendations when I mentioned a few dietary restrictions I had. Everything was delicious from the warm bread and dipping oils, to the pesto linguini with added shrimp and a take home of tiramisu. Each person who came to my table was attentive and kind, knowledgable and composed. Although the food was divine, the staff I encountered seemed to be the element that truly places this quaint authentic Italian restaurant at the top of my list for all time. Thank you, so much.

I've grown up in this area and even used to take dance lessons as a young girl at the business next door. I have watched as The Bread Basket has peaked and dipped in popularity and quality. To be honest I have never been a huge fan of the bread produced there. I have been a bigger fan of the freshly baked goodies that they made. They used to make these chocolate chips cookies that had brownie inside and they were absolutely to die for! Any ways, I was back in the area the other day and as I was driving I thought of the old Bread Basket and decided to drop in for a nostalgic moment and see what was different. To my surprise the shelves were all pushed back and the cold fridge was filled with meats and delicate pastries. I took a long time browsing around and looking at the new setup when suddenly I was greeted by a chipper owner (I am assuming) he mentioned that they roast and prepare all their own meat, no MSG, or preservatives and such. He was kind and cheerful, happy and very eager to serve as a new owner. I thanked him and kept looking, I noticed the roast beef n'swiss French dip on a baguette. It sounded superb it came with a side and I elected for the dill red potato salad. I also saw two soups tortilla and Toscana, I picked up a cup of each to save for lunches that week. All of it was delicious!! The roast beef was soft and flavorful, thin slices of garlic were hidden amongst the folds of the tender meat. The Swiss was melted and smooth and the Au jus was the actual drippings from the roasting process littered with little golden bits and packed with flavor. The tortilla soup was also scrumptious and though the Toscana was good it's creamy base was too rich for my personal taste, but then again I don't eat dairy (or meat)  very often so I am biased. The woman who rang me up (I am assuming the owners wife) was so sweet and what was most endearing about them is that they were both as nervous as could be! Wanting to fulfill this dream of owning their business, ready and willing to serve and sharing their passion with everyone who comes to see them. It was heartwarming and refreshing to see them thrilled about pleasing their customers and hoping that everyone in Mesa will love their food and embrace them. I will be back and I will spread the word. If you want to keep buying the stuffy old bread that's always been there, they have been kind enough to have it available. However the real treat is what is going on behind the counter in the kitchen NOT about the bricky bread sitting on the shelves. Great job, I hope the community supports you like I am and keep doing what you love cause I am loving what you are doing and so is my stomach!

There is just one suggestion that I want to make to the owners. Please extend your open hours. I have tried to go here several times in the last two weeks but work a full time job and your early closing time each day is extremely frustrating! Hire a couple kids to keep the shop open until 6-7 so the working stiffs can roll in after a long work day and pick up a cup of soup or a quality sandwich.

Ordered fettuccine Alfredo and the sauce was completely separated. It looked like butter and curdled cheese. I would not recommend this place.

Honestly a thumbs down on service, pricing and a thumbs way WAY down on food! Even the miso soup tasted like dirty salt water. I can only imagine they are solely surviving off being located by asu and serving booze because the sushi was a full blown FAIL!

Based on high ratings I really was excited to try this place. To sum it all up; the service was okay, the sushi seemed creative at first until you realize they all seem to mimic one another with just slight changes. The sushi even though creative lacks flavor as a whole, the prices and ratings are too high and the food under delivers. I'll stick with the two sushi places that I am always satisfied with Sakana and Hiro sushi.

Went here to celebrate and my husband was in literal "hog heaven" all the meats were great, I split a simple ranch salad with him, which was good. Mac and cheese is ridiculously good and so was the service. Too full for dessert but had one donut and it was crazy good too!!

This place is amazing!!!! I love sushi and my husband spent a few years in S Korea, normally Korean places in AZ either have good cooked food or good raw sushi but never both. THIS PLACE DOES!! My staples are the Spicy Tuna, Spicy Crab and most of all the Volcano Roll (I dream about this roll). They do happy hour pricing and all-you-can-eat 1-2 times a month. I don't know if i have a stomach big enough to benefit from the all you can eat, so I haven't done it yet. My husband gets their Korean soup and can't wait to try their Bu Dae Chigae, apparently none of the other places we have gone to have offered that dish. Love that they bring sides and keep them traditional and absolutely love their sushi!

I am a true fan! great for the vegetarian on the go :) DO NOT judge the D'Veggie bowl by its looks because it is fan-flippin-tastic! I wish they would come up with some other creative bowls though, they only have 2 to choose from and only one is for a veg. This place is true to the name, d'effing'lish :)

When I arrived at the ER animal clinic I was frantic. The front desk remained calm as did the first vet assistant who took her back. I was a bundle of nerves on the waiting room. after a quick assessment of my dogs vitals and a check for a snake bite she was appearing to be ok. They brought her out and offered for her to wait on my arms instead of in the back and I was very appreciative. If anything changed all I needed to do was let them know. Soon and room opened up and we waited in the back. Another poor sweet critical condition animal was brought in so the wait was pretty long but I didn't mind because they checked on us frequently. They brought water and checked inn on us every 20-30 minutes or so. I don't get upset about wait times because I love my dog so much I would only hope the same would be done for her if she were hit or severely injured. Soon the vet saw us, gave some recommendations on treatment options and told us how to know the difference between reptile/insect bites/stings in the future so we know what to look for. Our little pup got a tiny shot of pain medication to the paw and she was almost good as new. I thank the team there for their kindness and calmness and for taking care of my little puppy Alex.

Awesome place! made reservations ahead of time. They were a bit disorganized when retrieving all of us for our nails and pedis but the service was great, the experience was great. They are really clean and THAT is a big one for me. I never get my nails done because cleanliness is next to holiness for me but they were very very clean.

Disappointing. Went here today; service was  all over the place. We got our sushi first, miso soup second and appetizers last. Be cautious; spicy tuna is my staple but they use bone scrape tuna and that is low grade, gross tuna flake meat scrubbed of the bones. The king crab came out half filled with rice and it was $6.50. Don't cut corners and jip customers. We won't be back, there are better quality places around the valley.

BEWARE OF GROUPON. I had yet to see groupon abused up until the purchase of Honmachi's groupon. Main fine print does NOT state that the groupon does not take effect until july 4th AFTER 12AM. Don't get me wrong I understand their thought process of tempting customers with a groupon and even after mentioning our groupon at the front and getting nods of "acceptance" and allowing us to spike our bills thinking we have the cushion of a groupon, only to be informed we are 48 hours early on attempting to claim such a deal. Because listed in the SECOND fine print only AFTER you have purchased it already does it limit you to when you can actually use it. Leaving you first stuck with the bill and secondly stuck with a groupon you don't even want to use now because you feel absolutely deceived! grotesque abuse of groupon, sneaky to customers and showcases the type of corrupt people who own the restaurant. Only problem that they did not foresee is that groupon/yelp users are the worst to mess with because we will be the first to rate and warn other users. Oh yes, and the sushi was below mediocre. Keep the additional $15 bucks from my groupon, I won't give this place another cent.

**ATTENTION GROUPON USERS**. For those of your who purchased their groupon and tried using it on July 3rd (i heard them turn down the use of the groupon to the table behind us) I contacted groupon regarding the fact that i purchased the groupon and upon my attempts to use it on July 3, 2012, my waitress directed to me to the additional fine print that stated i was not able to use it until "July 4th after 12PM" It turns out that groupon allowed Honmachi's fine print to remain editable for 24 hours and after July 3rd the owners went back into their groupon and deleted the portion restricting the time frame in which it could be used. This act was extremely dishonest to their customers and since contacting groupon they have returned my funds. I will never be returning to this establishment in the future and would not recommend it either. The food itself makes it not worth returning to, the service is slow and they need to learn professionalism and the owners are obviously corrupt and none of these are acceptable from any establishment. Take your business else where and support HONEST locals like the family owned establishment of Sushi San about 15 minute drive and VERY worth it!

Getting a 5 star rating out of me for a sushi joint is no easy feat. I am very particular about freshness, taste, atmosphere, staff, selection, execution, presentation etc. I pretty much scrutinize every last detail. I snag sushi groupons whenever I see them to save a buck and search for an awesome sushi spot at the same time. This place I can confidently call a jewel sushi joint in Arizona! Excellent sushi rolls, sashimi and equally friendly wait staff. We sat the the bar which I don't always do because it is hit or miss as to if you will have an attentive waiter or preoccupied bartender. Well we got the mellow, attentive, fantastic bartender, who is an absolute asset to the establishment (and no I had never met him until tonight, for those of you thinking I'm a kind hearted friend) you always know if a place will be worth your while by the flavor of the miso soup, but hot damn this miso was a full bowl with hearty tofu, seaweed, scallions and robust flavor! Great start to the fantastic sushi that followed. This place is worth a trip out there, I live in Scottsdale and this place is a 35-45 minute drive and it is worth the trip. The ONLY complaint or suggestion I might give them is to remove the addition of cream cheese to all of the sig rolls, to me personally a menu riddled with cream cheese says that you are unable to successfully combine the texture and flavor of the raw ingredients you are working with to achieve a seamlessly tasteful end product, possibly with an accent sauce that does not over power. That's it in a nutshell, thank you for great service and fantastic sushi!

This place is ridiculously delicious, fresh, and fantastic! Everything is fresh, they have real wasabi and both classic sushi and inventive rolls. I love it because it is family owned and predominately ran by the husband and wife duo. The husband is an infinitely talented sushi chef and takes pride in his work. The customer service is off the chain wonderful. I could not think of one con to this place and my experience, only pros and a million and a half reasons to go back over and over again! YUMMY!!!

Unfortunately there is nothing special about this place. My husband got the french dip and myself the mushroom panini. Mine was rather disappointing, the mushrooms were minced so tiny and the flavor was semi reminiscent of canned cream of mushroom soup....on a sandwich. I hate leaving bad reviews but it wouldn't help anyone if i lied, sorry.

This place is amazing! The pan friend buns, pork dumplings and house noodles were incredible! The people who work here are sweet and humble and take great pride in their product. Ask for the special sauce for the dumplings, it takes them to the next level!

Went here for a family dinner. I originally stumbled onto this right at the grand opening but feel as if the quality has dropped dramatically. The rolls are small and  shriveled, the quality of the fish is mediocre, not fresh but not fishy either. The family owners are great but I just can't lead people to believe that this is the best sushi in the area. There are places that offer full healthy rolls that forte fresh fish instead of added fillers and fancy sauces littering the top.

Truly this place was delicious. Groupon brought us here, without it we would have never known it was tucked away chandler. I had butterfish sashimi with real wasabi and they were decadent. I LOVE that they have real wasabi, I thought it was delicious and fun to order and try. We ordered 2 other rolls and they were both flavorful and fun as well. No complaints from me, it did not blow me away but it was fresh and fun and really flippin good!

Lets get the bad out of the way first so we can spend more time on the good. The only flaw they need to work on is the amount of time it takes for them to return your missed calls. I can leave a message in the morning even before they open and it won't be returned until the next day. Also they should really have a cancellation list, as they are busy and tough to get into sometimes. NOW for the good! This place is great! I have not experience a single bad masseur and I've been twice and so has my husband. The rooms are quiet, their techniques are advance and on point. I have had Rhonda and Laura both do my massages and they both listened to my needs and delivered a quality massage. Pressure? on point! Technique? So Advance! I would definitely recommend this joint!

Went in with my husband for a pre-approved house loan. They retrieved a woman from the back who was still chewing her lunch as she greeted us. As we explained our needs she slid us a card with a website and said i could put the info in but it is better that you just go to the website, have a nice day. Needless to say we will not be going with WF and i shut down my accounts with them the next day.

Pacino's fell short on all requirements of a good restaurant. So it is Valentines Day night. I called in ahead of time and asked about the wait time, a discombobulated hostess shouted about in my ear trying to find out who could clean tables and how long and finally tells me they have one table open. We were there in a matter of only 5 minutes and saw plenty of open tables but shrugged it off. We waited while the table cleared and were sat down. After waiting nearly 25 minutes I finally caught the attention of a hostess and asked when we could expect to see our server and if we could see a menu. It is only now that I am told no menus are available that I can only opt in for their $40 per person 4 course pre fixe meal and neither one of us are 4 course hungry. I just asked that she have the server come over to the table to talk with us. *now quick side note I am an extremely observant person so when we were waiting for a table to clear earlier at the hostess desk I noticed the woman who should have been our waitress crying and being consoled by a girl near the front desk. Now I also have an empathetic heart and had felt sympathy for the woman when I saw this but if she had something going on that was interrupting her ability to work she should have gone and spoken with her manager for a solution*  Our waiter finally did come over and asked if we had questions about the pre fixe, I mentioned that we had never been told it was the only option and asked if we could order al a carte from the options available for the night. I was very kind yet firm in my request and before I even finished I got an onslaught of excuses, "the computers can't input that" "we don't have the capability" he even went as far as to begin to explain their food coding system and then finally did the right thing and said "let me check to see if that is possible" his frustration showed through his voice and eyes but he came back and let me know they could and then inflated the al a carte prices pretty exorbitantly $25 for 5 shrimp raviolis $23 for their chicken with squash and scalloped potatoes on the side. His service got better as the night progressed and as he understood that my appreciation for him accommodating the request was not fake. My date said his food was good and mine was seeming the same until I bit into the middle of the ravioli and found that the center on each of them was still ice cold. I should have said something but I didn't, I was just tired from the day and the escapades already so I ate them avoiding the center on each. The food was good, minus the frozen centers, but I have to be honest in saying that Alessia's Ristorante Italiano down the way is of much better quality, taste and most importantly service. I also wanted to discuss the attitude of the owner, or at least I assume he was an owner or manager. He wore brightly colored red/orange pants with a striped orange shirt and graciously greeted every guest around us except our table. This was absolutely appalling! He even stopped by a table of what appeared to be regulars several times, laughing and personally removing their finished plates. I have a background with customer service and so I decided to give him a chance as not to misinterpret the body language of our table and looked him dead eye until he saw me and still I got nothing, not a polite head nod or a simple thank you. You really can not treat your guests like that, they have chosen to devote their time, money and valentines day to your restaurant and that is how you treat them? I think he is forgetting that his guests are who create their success, without us there won't be a need for what you have to offer. Any way, the only two good things I did experience were this, our waiters attitude finally turning around midway through our meal and I wish we would have been seated outside because I watched another waitress in a red dress hustling back and forth from the kitchen to the outside without skipping a beat giving her guests a great experience on their valentines day. I could tell because each person I could see through the open doors had a bliss filled smile on their face, the way everyone should have been made to feel that night.

By far, the most amazing emergency room I have ever visited. No one wants to end up at the ER, but the staff here made sure that they made up for an ER visit by treating me with respect, kindness, courtesy and professionalism. I was so afraid to come in that I was shaking and near tears. They calmed me down, made me smile and treated me and my husband so wonderfully. I had the pleasure of being treated by Jen, Haze, Michael and Dr. Carey. Every single person we met was outstanding. Thanks for helping me, we need more people like each of you in this world!

I was not a fan. I had been excited to try this place for quite some time but everything just fell flat in the flavor department. From a bland sand which to an okay Vietnamese coffee to fried paper towel stuck to my egg rolls (yuck!) I was sorely disappointed.
