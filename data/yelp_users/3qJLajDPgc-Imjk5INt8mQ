Good food! Although, there was this strange flavor that seemed to be carried throughout each main and side dish. Great service, and the food came out at the right temperature and promptly. Fpr cleanliness, I would rate it 4 out of 5.

The short rib sandwich was uber delicious, as was the bread, salmon flatbread, and the coffee! We all know how much I love coffee, and I loved it, including the glass.  I also love how they flavor their water every day in a different way.  Another thumbs up for Fox Restaurant Concepts!

Let me just begin by saying that I am a huge fan of Fox Restaurant Concepts.  I had heard so much about True Food Kitchen, so I decided to grab a quick bite to eat.  While previously on their website, I was drooling over their Ahi Tuna Sliders; as a result, I ordered them.  I must add that I believe that wasabi (a prominent flavor) BELONGS with anything ahi related.  These sliders came with a wasabi aioli, but it was very bland, and you could not even identify that wasabi was involved.  I asked if there was another wasabi sauce available that was stronger, but instead, the chef gave me a Sriracha aioli which was more mayonnaise (again) than anything else.  The server saw that I was still not enjoying the sandwich (it all lacked flavor, even the fish), so she had the chef make a stronger aioli.  It was ALMOST there.  It was not even hot, only a hit of wasabi.    I know that everyone has a different heat preference, but all I was asking was to TASTE the wasabi.  I needed lunch and needed to jet so I finished the meal with the last wasabi aioli attempt.  I was ready to pay, and to my surprise, the server comped my meal!  It was a pleasant surprise.  I was not impressed at all by my first experience with the food, but because of the nice gesture by the server, I will return again.    True Food Kitchen has a great atmosphere and a friendly and attentive staff.  Try it for yourself. :)

I absolutely love this restaurant! The flavors are so incredible, and best of all, they have taken care of me (because of my food allergies). I feel safe eating here despite all of my food allergies. This is a must-visit and a must-eat! Also, the belly dancers rock!

I needed my windshield replaced ASAP, and they were very accommodating.  I called other companies to try and get them to fit in with my schedule, but Penske was very helpful in getting it done the same day.
