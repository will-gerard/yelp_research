I live around the neighborhood and my family loves sonic. Me on the other hand not so much, every time I come to this establishment I am always having to return as my order is NEVER correct. Simple instructions are very hard to understand and when they mess up You Would Expect Some Concern Or Desert But Receive none. The employees never have a clue about what car oder what, who ordered what and what the order was... ordered a cherry limeade slush no lime... drink came I asked does it have lime she said no. Tasted it and it had lime, I asked for no lime lady tells me she thought I ment no lime peel ... ??? For my bad service I asked for a strawberry shortcake smoothy and was told can't do it due to the price difference. I explained my past service and she reconsidered and came back with a mini lmao I ordered a medium drink and was bought a mini how is that great service. But also for my trouble I was given a free ice cream cone coupon !!!

My food is always missing something. If I order extra cheese they forget it. I usually get the nachos and I always have to return it due to no toppings

I am going with 5 stars May my server was awsome . She took my order corectly, gave feed back when I asked her what was best and followed up quickly with a check and to go box. The food was delicious and FAST I have never had food this fast and fresh before. (If it wasn't you couldn't tell) our table was never crowed with empty place or drinks low. The bar was slow but with a full place and it being happy hour I can understand why. The only issue I had was another waiter I believe the manager reaching over my plate and snatching a menu out of my hand.

In Mesa no subway puts double cheese on the chicken bacon ranch... I use to work at subway I know this sandwich gets double cheese. They say a customer is always right but this subway does not believe so. They have argued with me " I wanted to see how far it would go" about no extra cheese.

I had a rental that was not clean so they gave me a voucher for this place. When I get their they act just like any other car place ask what is going in the trash and what is not. When my car is ready no one came and got me or let me know. I sat in the lobby for 20mins "watching the news" till I just walked outside seen my car and got the keys. When I got into my car it looked as if they never washed the inside at all. Things I explained was trash was still there, the juice,soda, crackers, hair, and ect was still stuck to the leather and between the seats. Highly unsatisfied I could of saved interprise money and did the job myself

So after my bad experience I called the place and spoke to Kevin, he was kind and let me know it would not happen again. He offered to fix the situation by giving me a free car wash. We spoke for awhile. I just arrived and he knew who I was remembered my name and told me to get comfortable. I am more than sure my next visit will be better from now on. And I encourage people with problems to call Kevin and I'm more than sure he will correct the issue... It's the smallest things that matter

Had a reservation since friday for 20ppl and they are not ready have no seats available. When I came to the desk the lady seemed confused looking at the computer and once I spoke of taking my company else where she said she could come up with something but didn't give a time of how long it would take... The waiter was better making sure we all got our food and drinks but at the end he could not remember who's bill was who's and what food goes on what bill. We stayed a hour before giving up n just paying whatever the ticket said

No matter witch one I go to they are always delicious and the staff is very friendly. The service is always fast and I'm always happy about my portions. When I come here I am more than happy to pay for what I get knowing it will be well worth it. The meat is well done, rice is so soft and sweet, and the Mac is heaven... Even if it's made from simple ingredients. If someone has not tried it and I pass one we will go every time !

Hate coming here they take forever to make your pizza regardless if it's eat here/2go and the customer service sucks the staff is rude, I've had problems with my pizza before and they always have a attitude correcting it and never offer anything for my problem. Even with the new games and upgraded system

I have been coming here a year now and I refuse to go anywhere else, I am more than willing to wait in order to get a hair cut. Nick my Barber takes his time, he is a perfectionist and professional Barber. They take walk-ins and appointments. It's clean, great music, and always some educated debate going on.  Never have I came and had any issues with my hair or service. This is a very family oriented business. I have never met the owner seen him couple of times but never formally introduced my self but I can tell by the way he carries himself he runs this establishment very stricked and professional. This shop is always open when others close and each Barber is willing to stay late if you call ahead of time. If you want to see a true black successful businesses come here.

I took my child here and I love it, even though she was just a bit too young for fillings we found out at the end, the desk lady was funny polite and worked well with kids, the dentist was very helpful careful and caring. He went over everything with such detail and concern as if it was his child. When the anesthesiologist came he was the same way. They put my child to sleep and let us hold her while she drifted away and then took her. About a hour later they came to the Lobby and told us that she was not taking the medicine well and needs more time before they can try it again on a later date that she was too young. They gave her bottled water crackers stickers and a toothbrush for my cranky Tia. They did not push for another date they just simply said come back when you feel she is ready and we will take care of you again and if she continues to feel cranky bring her back and we will help.

Place is clean, looks new, server Liz was great and food was really good had a grand slam. Asked for the bacon to be really Krispy and I didn't have to send it back... Just for that I'm impressed, my gf asked for black coffee and the server didnt ask "cream"? So obviously they hire people with some form of intelligence.

Every time I come here the place is clean food is hot fresh and fast. I have never had a issue here or slightest to a problem. The waiters " usually female" love my kids and do anything to make them happy and smile. Regardless if that's their job you can alway tell when something is genuine.

Before I stumbled on this place I use to be a big petter piper fan never liked any other pizza from big chain food places. When I first came here I thought of subway, but more clean, military discount, and more friendly. They took me through the whole process and everything they had to offer without asking. I must say when I got home I had some more questioned so I called them and they told me that I could and should cook the pizza on the plate that it had come on. They was not upset or rushed me off the phone, nothing calm polite and even offered for me to call them when I have eaten to tell them how was my first pizza. From that day forward I come here and I recommend papa to everyone. All that needs left from this place is delivery

Z the owner is a old fashion guy. Mom and pop store this guy works hard doesn't speak English very good but always is cheerful and happy. Everytime I come in with my family or even by myself he always says hi and acknowledge my presents. His employees are friendly as well and don't watch u like your going to steal something like other stores. The price of the products are decent priced and the quality is good nothing is ever expired or stale. I just moved to mesa and hate this city for all it's worth witch is 0 but Z store is a good place.

I took my kids here last weekend the day it opened and can I say this is the best park I've been to in awhile. It had everything and more, they had such a great time. One thing I loved is how they have so much to do their and the two different playgrounds for ages of kids, it was really cool for the climbing web that goes around and the 30ft tower. Before leaving we ran up hills and went to the water fountain that was beautiful and put on a show. Kids got their face painted and ballon animals.

Doc was funny, staff was professional but also friendly. Vasectomy went quick I was not hassled about my decision or pressured into changing it like I heard from many people from other places. Honestly it was one of those visits that made you glade you came to that doctor.

Worst experience .... rude, nasty hard pizza. Argued with me about returning wings due to them making there own sauce. Order was messed up and took too long. Alot happened that would make this post Extremely long... FYI just don't come here, save your time, money, and patience with another restaurant.
