Love the decor and space of this place. And the staff was attentive and friendly. The food...was passable but not amazing. I've had great Chinese food but this was just okay. I the spring rolls were salty and the dish I ordered, the shrimp and chicken, needed a little more flavor. Maybe had I ordered a different dish I would have loved it but this dish left much to be desired. So overall it was OK but certainly I would think twice before coming back.

Love this place!!! The waitstaff was really friendly and helpful. Never a dull moment of conversation with them. The drinks were well made and since we went during happy hour a very good price. The cheese platter was tasty and we munched on that the entire time since they didn't go cheap on bread, fruits, and sides. One thing I will say about My Florist is they may possibly have one of the best pianist I've ever heard. If you only come for one thing you should come just to listen to her play. Amazing. The prices are reason, the decor is fun, the staff is great, the entertainment is A+. Promise if you go you'll have a good time!

This Theatre is BEAUTIFUL! I came to this theatre for a slient movie night. It did not disappoint. The movies that were chosen were great and really made you appreciate how movies started. The fact that this event happen here made it that much better. The staff was just sweet and so friendly. They were also helpful with fun facts on the theatre. The decor is just breathtaking. Its truly a piece of history that I hope more people will come to enjoy.

Pepin...not sure what to say except I'm NOT impressed. In fact I'm giving this place the extra star only because the Flamenco Dancer was good not amazing but good. That's its. The service sucked! The food had no flavor and the sangria was a joke! I was looking forward to having dinner here. I was here on vacation and my friend said that a few years back she'd go every weekend and loved it. Clearly time has not be kind to this place. Thanks but no thanks..not going back again..EVER!

I can't really comment too much on food at Z'Tejas since I didn't eat here but I can comment on their service, decor, and margaritas. Now one thing I'll have to say to Z'Tejas is "Job well done on your margaritas" You take your special drink serious and the taste shows. Your service as fast and friendly. Your decor as very Phx and Southwest proud. Next time I'll try your food but let me just add your prices for your food are too high and that was a turn off and we choose not to eat there. Otherwise...your team is going a great job.

Plain and simple this place sucks! The food was disgusting and the waiter wasn't able to give me any details on what was on the menu. This so called high end restaurant had some stuck up hostess and waitress. I ordered a steak medium rare, I was given a burnt piece of meat. I ordered lobster bisque and was given sloppy with butter in my soup and it was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten. This place can't do food or entertainment. The entertainment was called Envy. What a joke! They can't sign but apparently every overly tanned person in Arizona think they are wonderful. No accounting for taste. If you go to Scottsdale, take a pass on this place...its overpriced. What they spent on pretty building they should have spent on training staff and getting an actual DJ! Or and they should invest in a better chef.

This place is a joke!!! The staff is not friendly and slow to take an order. The music was awful...get a better DJ and it was basically a meet maket for horny old men. And the women seem to only want to compare boob jobs. I'll never go to this place again and if a reader is smart  they'll stay away too.

Hated it! Why do you have go-go dancers in a place that really doesn't need any! The staff is snobby ....please take my order and shut up! I got nothing but attitude and then I was shoved into a couple because apparently the guy behind me needed to go dance right away and he didn't even apologize. While all this happened the bouncer who saw what had occured did nothing and didn't even help me up.

Hello good food! Really this place has some great food! I was soo happy to eat here on my visit to Phoenix. Lets thanks my friend for taking me here and then lets thank the chef for the great tasting food. I had a NY Strip Steak with crab meat on it. The sauce had heat but not too much to burn your mouth. Which was excellent. I've always said that food needs to tell a story and this dish had a subtle beginning and an amazing end. The service was friendly and fast. The decor well it looks like a hideaway so that's actually kinda cute! The prices seemed reasonable for the food and the flavor. I'd go again!

Urban Bean is simply delicious! I can't seem to stop gushing about this place because the food is amazing. Its upscale taste at a reasonable cost.  I must admit that the only disappointment I had about this place was that more people weren't there to discover the tastiness of their food. I had a Pear and Arugula dish and the goat cheese, pesto, and sun dried tomatoes dish. Both made me mouth happy. Overall this place is adorable and the staff including the owner are helpful and friendly. I'd suggest that all of PHX go to this place and enjoy.
