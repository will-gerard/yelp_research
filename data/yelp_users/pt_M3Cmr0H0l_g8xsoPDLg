We found out about this place because we bought a restaurant.com gift certificate, but I also read about the creme brulee with the layer of chocolate on the bottom, which intrigued me. My boyfriend and I were celebrating his birthday tonight, and we had the arugala salad, shrimp scampi, prima vera rissotto, veal tortilini, tiramisu, and the creme brulee. They were all wonderful! But I'm a dessert person so I definitely give the tiramisu and creme brulee two thumbs up!  I have to say though, that what gives this cozy gem of a restaurant a solid five stars, is the owner. He was one of the most kind, generous, and passionate restaurant owners I've ever encountered. He was the one who sat us at our booth, opened my napkin for me, offered to take our picture, and the most astonishing and surprising thing of all... was at the end of the night; I had forgotten my credit card at home, so my boyfriend was going to go home (30 minutes away), while I waited there. I was absolutely embarrassed that we had no way to pay, and when my boyfriend was explaining the situation, the owner said absolutely NOT and that we could call him with our card number once we got home or the next day. He asked for no collateral and was very very kind about the whole situation. I have not seen that kind of trusting demeanor in such a long time, and it made me HAVE to write my very first review on yelp because of this. Our server was quite attentive and kind also, but the owner definitely understands the value of a customer's happiness, which can be lost in an economy like this.  I am very happy with Pane e Vino, and I'm sure that all of you fellow yelpers will have a lovely experience there as well. The food is above average, and the service is outstanding.

Me and the boyfriend gave Alize a try because of the awesome Travelzoo deal I got, which featured a 5 course tasting menu ($135). If it weren't for that, I'm pretty certain we would have not gone there to try because of the insane prices. It was our one year anniversary so I wanted to do something fancy, and I have never tried a tasting menu before, so that was pretty exciting!  We made our reservations for 7pm, about an hour before we wanted to dine. Keep in mind that it was a Wednesday night, so it might not be as easy to get a reservation on a weekend. The self parking was a bit far from the Ivory Tower, which is where the restaurant is located. It's on the 56th floor, but when you look at it from the outside, the building doesn't seem to have that many stories (just an observation). I requested a table near the window because of other yelp reviews, and luckily, there was one available! The host graciously gave me the seat with the better view facing the strip, while my boyfriend got the seat with his back to the strip. It was quite beautiful. You could see the whole strip and the twinkling lights of the neighborhoods in Vegas too. They also laid our linen napkins on our laps, which made us feel extra fancy.  When we sat, there was a plate on the table decorated with a key design and a hefty, silver skeleton key laying on top of it. The host said it would be for the end of the meal, and opened a box with a gift for us inside. I just wanted the key. It was a quirky and mysterious concept. I loved it!   We started off with bread service, which featured french baguette, a pretzel type bread, and gluten-free biscuits. We both had one of each. My favorite of them was the gluten-free biscuit. The french baguette was a little ordinary, and the pretzel bread seemed a little tough to chew on.  The amuse bouche that they brought out next consisted of pear, radish, and something I couldn't identify on top of that. I didn't really remember everything that he said, but there was also a cup of delicious apple-cinnamon consomme on the side that really made the dish feel comforting and homey. The pear itself was refreshing and crisp, and a sharpness about it, but the consomme really helped mellow it out.  Our first course consisted of the hamachi tartare and maine lobster ratatouille. I personally preferred my lobster to the hamachi. The ratatouille underneath it was flavorful and was really the star of the dish even though there was lobster on there too. They were both cold dishes.  For the second course, we chose the sauteed foie gras and the foie gras terrine. This was probably the first time I ever had foie gras at all, so the second course was an adventure for me. My foie gras terrine was served cold and with toasted and buttered bread. I thought it was just ok, but again, I don't have a defined palate when it comes to foie gras. However, the sauteed foie gras... DELISH. Probably the star of the entire meal. It just melted in your mouth with smokey goodness and was absolutely delectable. It was a freakin' sexy bite of food. Would do it again, fo sho.  Third course. We got the seared scallop and Irish salmon. To me, this was a tie. I loved both dishes. The presentation was spot on for both! Just good seafood. Both were perfectly cooked. Flavor-wise, the salmon was probably more flavorful than the scallop.  Fourth course consisted of the entrees! This was probably the hardest one to choose from cause we got to pick out of 6 choices instead of the usual 3, like the others. The boyfriend had the rack of lamb. I ended up choosing the veal wellington, just because how often do you have wellington? And also, I've never had veal before. I felt a little guilty though, since it is a cute baby animal. Oh well. It was so freaking good. So tender and moist.  Last, but not least, dessert. Chocolate souffle and grand marnier souffle all the way. My boyfriend preferred his grand marnier and I preferred my chocolate. The chocolate was decadent and rich, but still so fluffy and light. It was like magic in a bowl. His tasted like a custard with the essence of orange to it. We usually don't finish dessert when we get it, but this time, we did.  At the end of the very satisfying meal, they offer you coffee/after dinner drinks, and petite fours (small chocolates/sweet morsels of candy, etc). They lured us in and my boyfriend got a coffee and I got a cappuccino. I also wanted to indulge and try all the petite fours but I was so stuffed that I only got a toffee, hee hee.  We finally got to open our box too, and they had given us a tiny chocolate cake with a chocolate disc that said "Happy Anniversary" on top. It was adorbs. We loved the whole meal and would definitely consider doing it again. Also, for vegetarians, the tasting menu always had one choice in each course that was vegetarian so hooray for that! The presentation was spot on for everything. And the ambiance really elevated the romance level. It was a great night.

I'm pretty overdue to write a review for this place, but here it is. This spot is my happy place when the morning is just a little too rough. I'm usually awakened by the baristas shouting down the long line of people, "Nina! Are you getting 5 Lindseys today?" If you don't know what a Lindsey is, get one. 6 shots of espresso in a velvet. Wake you right up. Other things I find amazing there: flourless chocolate cake, their scones, their quiches, their tiny pretentious, but adorable, double macchiatos with a little bit of whip.  It's a nice place for a first date or catching up with friends. If you need a little more quiet to study, there's a room in the back with less commotion.  There is also a bar. For after you're done studying.

I just recently moved into my first official place, a second story condo and was hoping to do wood tile as it's all the rage nowadays, I've heard. But, alas, tile was way too expensive to install and hello, I can't install that stuff myself. Ain't nobody got time fo dat. So after reading a bunch of awesome reviews here on Yelp, I decided to contact Cosimo for some help, hoping that he would have some great price on tile and the install for it. He responded super fast, which I loved, and came out to do an estimate for me! I had already kind of picked a tile out that I liked but after looking at it, he did notice that there was some bowing going on, which made sense since the tile was fairly inexpensive. He also pointed out that the install would be very expensive for tile and because I live on the second floor, the tile would most likely not be completely flat. He suggested instead high end laminate which is just as durable, looks more like natural wood, and is much cheaper to install. I went to visit his store to see the options, and he has a lot of nice options for laminate wood-style floors! My family couldn't even the difference between the laminate and the real wood floors he had. I found one I absolutely loved and met all my criteria and his crew worked super fast. After ordering the wood, he booked his crew to install the floor within a week and they got it done in 4 days! And it was amazing work! It was super beautiful and they did an exceptional job on the stairs, as well.   The only small thing I wish I had been warned about was that they wouldn't leave everything exceptionally clean, so there was a fine layer of dust on everything, which was fine, as it's not their job to be cleaners. He did offer to have them come out again and wipe everything down for me, which was nice of him, but I didn't want to impose. So just know, if you're getting your floors done, make sure you put everything in storage or cover it if you don't want it to be dusty! Luckily, I didn't have anything really in the condo, so I didn't have to do that much cleaning but I could see it being a problem for people who already have things moved in.   Overall, I was super happy with my floors and everyone who's come to see it has told me it looks great. I feel like it has the charm of wood floors without the maintenance and I'm all about things that are low maintenance. I was really happy with the great service, the price, and the speediness of the work.

So I knew I was taking a gamble coming to this place because of the mixed reviews. Unfortunately, it did not pay off this time. It's really sad because I thought the massage itself was fine. It wasn't the worst, it wasn't the best I've ever had, but I probably could have left feeling relaxed and happy. Sadly, I left feeling guilty and shamed.   I've been to a couple reflexology places now so I felt I kind of knew what to expect. They seemed friendly enough at first but there were little things throughout the massage that bothered me. First, the towel that I put my feet on was kind of damp, which freaked me out because I had the impression that clean towels used for drying your feet, should be dry. So all I could think about was if they had previously used this towel on someone else before me. Then during the massage, the ladies were talking to each other while they were massaging us in Chinese, which I didn't really care for. The lady massaging me also didn't check on me and ask how I was feeling or if I needed any adjustments to pressure. For review sake, they do ask you to take off your shirts and my lady actually unclasped my bra which surprised me. You are not in private rooms and actually anyone passing, can probably see you. Even if you are covered with a towel. So just be aware of that. In general, I felt like she didn't care too much for how relaxed I was feeling and was basically just doing her job. Which is fine.   The thing that really ruined it for me was that when we finished the massage, I left a 20% tip and one of the ladies massaging us made a comment "Hard work.." in like a disappointed/accusatory tone. Which implied that I was a cheap tipper. I usually do tip more but the massage wasn't mind blowing and I thought what I gave was fair for what we got. But to have the audacity to say something like that to my face for someone in a service industry... Any other person in any other massage place would get fired for that. And why? Because I'm never going to go there again. But if she hadn't said anything, and just complained about it after we had left like everyone else in the industry does, I probably might have gone back there.  I do feel some empathy because it is hard work... But #rude! If they feel like they aren't being paid enough, then they should complain to the owner to raise the prices instead of forcing people to pay tips or  shaming people for not tipping 40%. Or get another job. What can I say. Service industry is about good service. And you only get paid when you provide it.
