I would avoid Raintree pet resort. We were very good customers there for almost 3 years. Our yellow lab went for all boarding and also for daycare group play time once a week.  In January our dog was attacked during group daycare by another dog and required an overnight hospitalization to get stitches on the inside of his mouth. The owner of Raintree got extremely defensive when I started asking questions and didn't even offer a shred of sympathy for what happened. They refused to provide any information about the dog that attacked our dog and we have since removed our dog from there for good.  We loved taking him there until this event really showed how the owner treats their customers when a problem comes up. The staff was fantastic, until the owner's consolidated the two locations and starting making cuts to make room for their daughter to be the manager. It is a real shame what happened, but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  3/3/11 Update  Having read the comment below by Julie I just want to add that when we were first notified of the incident by Raintree Pet Resort we were clearly told that our dog was ATTACKED BY ANOTHER DOG.  Since then the story has changed multiple times.  The fact remains that our extremely passive dog was the only one that needed immediate medical attention and an overnight hospitalization.  It is interesting that it is now being described as a 'mutual altercation'.

Lipstick on a pig pretty much sums up this hotel.  the reviews below are pretty much spot on.  We checked in last night.  They weren't able to accommodate our reservation for a king bed room so they said that they upgraded us to a 'City View' room with 2 twin beds.  The receptionist then went on to talk about how awesome this room upgrade was and that it was way better than what we had reserved.  Uhhhh, not exactly.  The hotel is being renovated, as mentioned, but the renovations really just look like they are covering up a crappy hotel instead of actually fixing the problems.  The show is ridiculous.  It is impossible to turn the water on without fully stepping into the shower because of the half glass wall (instead of an actual shower curtain).  Then, once you get in the shower, the water sprays everywhere because of, wait for it... Yes, the lack of a shower curtain.  The sink is absurd and the drain is not adjustable, so you end up having to take the drain stop out.  Also, good luck finding adequate outlets.  They really need to invest in lamps that have built in additional outlets (like the majority of hotels now have).  The elevators need to be replaced and the logo on the elevator walls appear to be made of tin foil, seriously.  I asked for the wifi password and it was provided, but when I signed on it looks like they actually charge people for it.  The biggest joke, they charge $14 to park over night in their run down, pot holed, ill lit parking lot.  Needless to say, I will never stay there again.

Great lunch spot.  Portions are extremely generous.  Usually I get the chef salad, which is piled high with meat.   Their daily specials are also really good.  The atmosphere makes me feel like I am back home in Jersey, so that is one of the reasons why I keep going back.    The wait staff always greats us and recognizes that we are in there about once a week.  At lunch, it is nice when our drinks show up at the table without us even having to order them.    Definitely give it a try for lunch, if you are in the area.

My wife and I were married here in October of 2006 and it was as close to a fairytale wedding as possible.  I am pretty sure that we were either the 2nd or 3rd wedding ever held at Silverleaf.  The location, service and staff were all amazing and they have been so ever since.    Food at both the club house and Stone House (after the turn on the golf course) is always fantastic and the specials are fresh and unique.  Home made ice-cream is available in multiple flavors and can also be taken to go!  Their french fries are amazing as well.  The best party at Silverleaf was back in '06 (I think) when they put the giant tent up on the hill.  I heard that the tent alone was about $700k.  Tickets were extremely reasonably priced because the event was also being used to market some of the lots for sale in the upper canyon.  Nobody knew who the performers were going to be so when the stage rotated around everyone was surprised to see that Kenny Loggins was performing for this private event.  The food and drinks were fantastic and I have wished that they would throw another over the top party like that again.  Two years later we did go to the spring party to see Earth, Wind and Fire, but it will never be as good as that party on the hill.  In the last couple of years the real estate market has taken a big hit. While property might not be selling as well the service at the club has never changed below 'Fantastic'.  It is refreshing to see that the club is being operated in the same fashion and enthusiasm as it was when it first opened.  Being a private club does present a challenge for people to experience the location and food.  However, if you are ever presented with the opportunity to go, don't pass it up.

Robert McGrath is an amazing chef.  That really is all that needs to be said when it comes to Pischke's.  If have have never been here before it is absolutely worth the trip.  You won't bump into a lot of tourists because the atmosphere is very laid back.  However, the food is wonderful.  We were huge fans of Roaring Fork (before Robert sold it) and we even had McGrath cater the rehersal dinner for our wedding.    The green chili pork stew is by far one of the best items on the menu and it can be ordered to share with the table, or it is enough for a whole meal.  One of our favorite, casual, places in Old Town.

I made a reservation for 6:30pm and we arrived just before that. We were told that our table was not ready yet, but it would only be 3 minutes before we were seated because we were next. We went to the bar to have a glass of wine as we waited.  During this time the hostess sat 2 other parties of 4 in front of us. Each time I asked about our table and she would say 'oh, yes, you are next but your table isn't ready'.   Finally, at 7:20pm, we were seated at our table. We were told, by the hostess, the delay was because of the lobster special. I find that strange because the couple at table next to us said that you had to order the lobster in advance with your reservation so I doubt that was the actual cause.   My wife ordered the Famous Steak. I get concerned any time a restaurant butterflies a filet, but it sounded good. My wife asked that it be prepared medium rare and was very specific because after the steak is cooked it is covered in mashed potatoes and baked again. Unfortunately, the steak came out medium well. We sent it back and did get another one cooked properly. However, by the time the replacement steak came out we were almost done eating.   I ordered the meatloaf based on our servers recommendation. I thought it was just average and really did not care for the crispy (aka burnt) edges. The other couple we were with ordered the East meets West (surprising small portion) and the burger. There was no ketchup on the plate with the burger and by the time some arrived at the table the burger had gotten cold.   Drinks from the bar were slow as well. It took over 10 minutes for a vodka on the rocks to arrive.   Our server was fantastic and we did feel bad making our concerns known because we knew that she would be held responsible even though the wait and over cooked food was not her fault.   Eddie's wife stopped by the table and we politely told her about our dining experience.  We were not looking for any type of handout, we just wanted her to know what was going on in her restaurant.  She was very nice and sent over a round of desserts and invited us to call her before our next trip back.   Overall the food did not live up to what we were expecting. Maybe we caught them on a bad night. We might go back to try it again, but not if we would have to wait 40 minutes after our reservation time for a table.

Salt, salt, salt.  Went to Café Bink last night, for the first time, for dinner with my parents and in-laws.  Let me start off by saying that we are huge fans of Binkley's and think that it is one of the best restaurants in Arizona.  The service at Café Bink was very nice.  Our waiter was attentive and responsive and actually seems to enjoy his job.  Food on the other hand, well, judging by the other reviews here, they must have been having an off night.  Our table started with some appetizers and soup.  I had the mushroom soup, which I thought was very good.  Probably one of the best things that I tasted there.  My wife ordered the mussels.  Multiple people at the table tried them and they all agreed that they didn't taste right.  They didn't taste 100% spoiled, but they just didn't taste fresh either.    We brought this to the attention of our waiter and he quickly removed the dish and brought it to the attention of the chef.  I was able to see the chef taste the mussels (in the reflection of the window) and his response was that they taste fine.  Strange, but it was appropriate that they removed the dish from our bill.  Next up was Amy's Bolognese.  Everyone has raved about how great this is so both my wife and mother ordered it as their main course.  I could not believe how over salted the dish was.  It wasn't as if it was a little bit of salt.  Salt was the predominate taste of the dish and it was terrible.   We were now starting to actually feel guilty about sending back another dish, but it had to be done as the Bolognese was not edible.  Our waiter was very nice, again, when we brought this to his attention.  He had the manger come over as well.  We told her that it was very salty and she said that they actually get that complaint pretty often.  Really?  You are told that your food is over salted and yet you continue to cook it that way?  Her response was that since many people don't cook with much salt at home they aren't used to it when they go out to a restaurant that uses salt.  While that may be true, I have never had this problem at any other restaurant and I don't think that a quality chef should be using that much salt to define their dishes.  I ordered the Steak Frittes and asked to have it cooked medium rare.  I would have appreciated knowing up front that the steak is actually only a quarter inch think and therefore cannot really be cooked to order.  While the steak wasn't salty, it definitely wasn't anything great.  Bland and boring are the best way to describe it.  My father ordered the Beef Stew off of the waiter's recommendation.  Guess what?  Way over salted.  The other two dishes that the table got were the Scallops and the Fried Chicken.  At least the chicken was supposed to be salty.  While I feel bad for writing such a poor review, I can honestly say that our party was extremely disappointed with the meal last night.  For those prices the food was not worth it.  The presentation was boring and the flavor was totally ruined by all of the salt.  We might try it again, but probably not anytime soon.

Well, as the former Yelp "Duke" of this restaurant it is hard to write this review.  We used to walk in and be greeted by name. We were there at least once a week.   What was once a fantastic and reliable lunch spot has changed, and it isn't a change for the better. The menu has been totally replaced, the kitchen staff is new and the product just doesn't taste as fresh.   The classic Itialian sandwich (TNT) is gone. No calamari on the lunch menu either (not even by special request).   I know the ownership has changed hands, but this drastic of a change is either a message to the regulars that they aren't valued anymore or just a way to boost revenue.   Such a shame as we have been going here for about 10 years. The restaurant has changed from a great reliable place to just meh.

The light at the end of the tunnel has been turned back on and the old menu is back!  So glad to be able to enjoy all of our favorites again!  John is the best, and along with the food, one of the main reasons we come back so often.

This review is based on how we were treated, not the food because we didn't actually get to eat.   Called on the afternoon of July 9th and they said no reservations were open. I asked if they take walk ins and they said yes, but to expect a wait of about 45 minutes.   We showed up at 7 expecting to wait. The hostess told us that they had no tables until 9pm. That is when their first open reservation would be.   I asked if we could wait at the bar as walk ins and told them that I had called earlier about that exact thing. She basically said 'too bad' and that we would have to wait til 9 unless we wanted to eat outside on the patio (nobody was outside in this heat).   I have heard this place is good, but the hostess was quite rude with her tone and basically told us to leave.    It seems that this place could benefit from some additional training to make sure that all of the hostesses are on the same page.

So, we didn't have a good experience the first time we tried to go, but we really wanted to give this place a second shot.  We made reservations about 2 weeks in advance to make sure that we were all set.  At first I was a little put off because when the hostess called to confirm the reservation she said that "typically, parties of 4 take about an hour and a half to eat. Will that be enough time for you?"  I was stunned because nobody has ever asked how long my dinner is going to take, especially when we make a reservation.  So, we showed up last night with a little bit of a chip on our shoulder about what the dining experience would be like.  It turns out that the entire evening was fantastic.  Our server, Rachel, was spectacular.  She took the time to go over the entire menu since we had never been there before.  She answered all of our questions about the dishes and made some wonderful suggestions.  Everything that we ordered was top notch!  The guacamole was probably some of the best that we have ever had.  The tostada was fantastic along with the crispy pork served in the lettuce (will definitely get that again).  The steak tacos were delicious as well.  Definitely get the street corn, it is out of this world!  We will definitely go back to try some of the other dishes (and we will definitely make a reservation in advance).  By the way, we were at our table for about 2 hours and not once did anyone come by and try to pressure us to leave.

I saw in our neighborhood newsletter that Banzai had opened up on March 3rd.  Last night my wife and I went up there to try it out.  I am glad that another sushi bar has gone into this location.  I was a big fan of Blue Wasabi at DC Ranch because it was great atmosphere.  At times we were there 3-4 nights a week.  Banzai Cowboy certainly is trying to make their place a fun spot to be.  The owners of this place are the former owners of NYPD Pizza, so they have the restaurant experience.  The food was very good.  For their second day open we didn't have any problems with dishes coming out wrong (which is typically when some places open their doors).  The staff was friendly and had a great attitude about the place.    The menu is nice and has a bigger variety, food wise, than what Blue used to have at DC Ranch.  We tried a bunch of their specialty rolls and thought all of them were good.  They have about a dozen martini's on the menu and I only tried two of them last night.  They were pretty good.  My only complaint is a small one.  I started out by ordering a tall Captain and Coke, my standard drink.  I was disappointed that instead of being served in a pint glass (or something of similar size) it was served in one of those narrow Collins glasses.  Had I known I never would have ordered the drink tall because there really isn't any benefit too it.   This place has got different stuff going on every night, so they should be able to bring in a decent crowd.  25% off on Monday if you wear Cowboy or Japanese apparel.  It's spelled out on the menu with the details.  Karaoke on Thursdays and a bunch of other stuff the rest of the week.  I really hope this place does well because it is nice to have a fun, casual sushi bar in the neighborhood.

Living in the neighborhood directly behind AJ's is both a blessing and a curse.  It is very easy to run up to pick up some last minute items, but as we all know, AJ's is not the cheapest place around.  We definitely don't do our regular grocery shopping up here.  However, we are up here almost every Saturday and Sunday morning enjoying breakfast.  With coffee refills at $0.75 and amazing muffins it is difficult to go anywhere else.  It is a shame that Miguel is no longer manning the grill and omelet station.  He was the absolute best and seemed to really enjoy seeing all of the regulars come back time after time.  Alice, behind the bakery counter, is fantastic.  She always comes out to say hi to our two daughters and give them a big smile.    Pistachio muffin is fantastic.  Try it if you haven't already.

Yum!  I am so glad this place has opened and Robert McGrath is back doing what he is great at.  I won't hide the fact that I am a huge fan of his.  He catered the rehearsal dinner to my wedding with the great food of Roaring Fork (before it was sold).  Went last night for an early dinner and the reservation list looked like it was extremely full.  We started with the signature green chile pork stew and it was delicious.  Slightly different than the way it was prepared at RF, but it is something I would definitely get again.  I had the Big Ass Burger (oops, I mean Bob's Burger) and it was fantastic.  It was slightly over cooked, but I attribute that to the kitchen still getting all of their timing down.  The burger and side of fries are huge and probably the best value on the menu for $12.  My wife had the blackened catfish and said it was fantastic.  We also had some of the green chile mac, but we already knew that would be great.  The best part about this new place is that the staff is very professional.  I can't tell you how many new restaurants I have been to where they end up hiring a bunch of kids who don't know anything about food or service.  Renegade seems to be staffed with people who are excited about the restaurant and it shows.  Can't wait to go back.  Bar menu includes one of my old time favorites of Buzzard Breath Chili served in a bag of Fritos.   We will definitely be back and this place will make it into our regular rotation of great places to go.

Went here for lunch last Friday and thought it was great.  From the outside it didn't look like they were open, but we went in to check it out.  The inside is very nice and we were seated right away.  Their lunch menu is very nice and has a wide selection.  It seems very similar to The Greene House across the street at Kierland.  I had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Salad and was very impressed.  I initially thought that it would be a boneless skinless breast sliced on top of the salad, but was very happy to see that it was grilled, on the bone, chicken.  The dressing was great and the portion size was perfect.    While there I saw several of the other entrees and will definitely be going back for more.  Downside - They need to get rid of the few wicker chairs that they have.  I had the unfortunate luck to be seated in one of them and they were the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever sat in.  Luckily there aren't very many of them, so they should be easy to avoid.

After our second trip to Searsucker I decided it was time to write a review.  On our first visit my wife and I (along with the other couple we were with) thoroughly pleased.    The menu is simple in its description, so on your first visit you will need to spend some time with your server to find out what everything really is.  Luckily, our waiter on our first visit was fantastic.  He took all the time we needed to describe almost every appetizer on the menu and then he made some fantastic recommendation.  Highlights are the Chicken and Waffle appetizer and my wife raves about the bacon and eggs.  They were both absolutely amazing.  I also enjoyed the seasonal berry vodka.  On our second visit last night we had a business dinner for 9 people.  The restaurant probably isn't great for a large group like this because the atmosphere is very loud, however, the food was still fantastic.  Everyone had a nice time and we will definitely return.  As a side note, sometimes it isn't the way a restaurant handles the good things that set them apart, but by the way that they handle some of the poor things.  Unfortunately, my entrée last night was not so great.  It was dry and bland, but I didn't want to make a big deal of it in front of my clients.  I discretely told our waitress and she immediately offered to get me something else.  I explained that I didn't want to slow down the flow of the meal, but I would be okay.  A few minutes later the manager stopped by and very discretely apologized, thanked me for bringing my group into the restaurant and then made things right.   How they handle little, insignificant incidents like this gives me the impression that they truly care about the customers and because of that we will definitely be back (because the chicken and waffle appetizer is just that good).

Ordered food. Was told it would be delivered in 30-45 minutes.  3 couple together had 6 kids under the age of 6 and they were all starving for dinner.  After an hour and 20 minutes we called and they said they sent 5 deliveries in one car and that we (the customer) are the problem.   The food never ended up getting delivered because the owner felt that we wouldn't want it after all that time.  I went to the restaurant to speak with the owner to find out what actually happened.  Who ever took the order wasn't paying attention, didn't know how to spell, didn't know to ask for a customer to clarify an address or ask for a phone number that the customer could be reached at.    I have no idea how the food actually is, but was given the 12" pizza on my way out with parting word to "not order the 12" thin crust to go because they just don't hold up well for travel".  Makes me wonder why they gave it to me it they really aren't proud of it.  Had the restaurant been up front and honest with timing (and actually told us if a pizza wouldn't be good delivered) maybe we would have had a chance to try it.
