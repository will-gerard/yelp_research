We ordered the seafood relleno. it was amazing! it came with chipoltle cheddar mashed potatoes and cornbread. Also amazing. We sat at the bar and the bartender, Steve, was very friendly. A definite must go!

I was so upset to call on Friday to schedule an appointment with PA Jason Arnett and find out he is no longer with West Dermatology! WTH? He has been my doctor for over 5 years now and knowing he's been with the practice for at least 14 years just floored me. He's been replaced with some other PA, whom after reading up on her, has the experience, but Dr. Arnett had my trust. I definitely won't be going back there! DR. ARNETT....where are you???

Visited the first day it opened and still a repeat customer. Ask for the cucumber jalapeno martini (secret menu item me and the bartender know).
