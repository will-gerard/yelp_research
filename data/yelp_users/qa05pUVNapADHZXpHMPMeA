We freaking love Paisley Violin. Now, my five stars does not mean it is perfect, it has flaws that I will mention, but I do not believe your Phoenix experience is complete without a Friday or Saturday night visit to this lovely establishment.  The first time we walked in it felt like Cheers, everyone said hello, the musicians, the bartenders, the bar patrons, as if we were old friends returning from a long trip. Now look, it isn't pretty inside, it's divey, a weird fish tank and ventriloquist doll are kind of strangely displayed, but look past that and see this place for what it is, a local joint with real honest to goodness people serving you. Good drink, great food, great music, great atmosphere, great service. The toasted pesto brie was delicious, the brie was not overpowering, and it complimented the pesto just right. Their vegetable stew was very good with huge chunks of vegetables and a hearty sauce, the peppered raspberry turkey is magic in your mouth, the royal is a wonderful sandwich with roast beef, mozzarella and garlic pepper and the venice violin, with soppressata, pepperoncini, balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard on a baguette is practically inspired. The desserts are good too, but not all house made, we destroyed the baklava, it's highly recommended. Now the bad, aside from the place being divey, which isn't bad to me but I know it is to some, is that the parking is kind of a nightmare. Last I went I had to park in front of a very ghetto looking house with a guy cleaning his shotgun on the porch. Paisley Violin is not in a "nice" part of town, and with only a couple actual parking spots, you will be parking in a strange neighborhood in front of a stranger's house... sorry. But it's worth it, check with the Paisley Violin website and go on a night they have entertainment.  Check this place out with a good friend and an open mind, we love it.

I was completely skeptical about Phoenix Ranch Market when my wife said we were going to go check it out last week, so skeptical that I told her I didn't want to go, in all honesty... what could possibly be so good about a little grocery store in a not particularly good part of downtown Phoenix after all? EVERYTHING. Prices lower than Walmart, the largest selection of 89 cent pastries I've ever seen, several small "restaurants", full cows heads for only 49.99, a vast selection of specialty items most grocery stores don't carry much of (Hispanic stuff, fruits, vegetables), plus, it's probably the most clean grocery store I've ever been in. While we don't live close enough to make this our go-to grocery store, I can guarantee you'll see us here several times a month from now on. Five big fat ones for sure.

All I can say is I got my wife a massage package for Christmas last year and she hasn't stopped talking about it. She was glowing for weeks. The staff was awesome about helping me pick out a package in my price range without trying to upsell me. I would highly recommend giving a package as a gift, my wife LOVED it.

I was king for a day. While staying a the Royal Palms I felt like the world was my oyster, every wish was my command and everything I desired seemed to be thought of before I desired it. In short, customer service here is phenomenal. Astounding even. The resort has beautiful grounds, a nice bar area, the basic room is fairly roomie and has a big ole bathtub in it, the pool is open twenty four hours... this is seriously huge for me because I work graveyard and honestly want to take a dip at 3am, I truly walked away unable to think of something that could have been better... and while I think I got my room for a steal, knowing how amazing this place is, I will have no problem paying full price the next time a staycation comes up. You just have to visit, look for a deal or whatever you need to do, but if the opportunity to stay here comes up, take it. You will love it.

My original review still rings true. I love it here. It's my staycation of choice without hesitation. I love how lush and green it is, I drive twenty minutes but feel like I'm in a completely new place. The casitas are my favorite place to stay, I'll bring little speakers and play Sinatra or Armstrong out on the patio, light up a nice cigar, have a glass of wine, play a card game, whatever I'm doing I'm happy.

With a fairly large selection of dynamite sandwiches and sugary baked goods, LGO has become a pretty regular staple for me at lunchtime. It has an open and relaxing atmosphere with lots of windows and natural lighting, a solid beer and even solider wine selection, and a grocery store with cute little knick knacks that's fun to peruse. This place is great.

I am most likely considered a "casual" traveler, I take one to three flights a year at the moment, and I've had pretty consistently good experiences here at Sky Harbor, plus the thought of a bunch of wonderful local restaurants and breweries moving in sooner or later just makes me all kinds of happy. The traffic around the airport is always very manageable, whether it be foot or vehicle traffic, the runway has never been swamped enough to delay any of my flights, I have never been harassed or detained by security for any reason, and there always seems to be someone nearby if I need help with anything. I even will typically show up a bit early to hang around the airport and explore for a little bit... I've been to quite a few airports in my day and I've got to say Sky Harbor is my favorite.

A really neat trinket of a place in the middle of nowhere. I won't try to explain this enigma, I will just say that you will find SOMETHING here that you think is cool. Some parts will pique your interest and others will bore you, but this is a great place if you're looking for something different to do. Check it out!

As far as Michaels stores go, this place is awful. The floors are dirty and cluttered and the staff is very loud, like yelling across the store loud. I felt gross being here, go to Hobby Lobby instead.

Ruffino was the first restaurant my family ate at when we moved to Arizona, which means that simple math would suggest I've been eating here for sixteen years! Seriously. I've eaten here several times a year for sixteen years and have been through either two or three owner changes. I love it. From the mildly cheesy, somewhat 80s styling to the tuxedo'd out waiters, I can't get enough. Ruffinos is a classy restaurant where you're more than some random customer and through my years here, the management has practically bent backwards at times to make things right.  The food here is incredible, and if you're lucky enough to come on a night they have osso bucco, you'll be stuck coming back for the next sixteen years like me. I can vouch for so many of the food items here, but I'll just make a couple of suggestions. For starters the clams casino and escargot can't be beat, they are both rich and garlicky and the escargot is simply not as chewy as most places, so good. For your meal try the tortellini ruffino, one of my favorite meals of all time, or the veal ruffino or filet medallions if they have them. But the osso bucco is a step above most things I've tried in my life. Expensive and worth it.  Look, I don't waste my time on bad restaurants, I eat at good places and me continuing my business here for so long means they're doing something very well, try out Ruffino and see what it is.

Ugh... Why do people keep dragging me here? When eighty percent of your menu is fried food, and it all comes out dry or over breaded, you've got a problem. And those big bad steaks they serve are so underwhelmingly boring that it's a joke. And that "spectacular" view isn't even that good! Nothing compared to the view at Compass Grill, which is pretty close to the same price. Goodness. One star for the only good things I've tried so far, the free bread and free cotton candy, and another star for having a slide. I'm sick of this place.

Another restaurant Kevin and I frequent when we are out and about in Chandler. Good prices, and the food is consistently good. I love the vegetarian pizza. In fact, their pizzas are all pretty good. Kevin got the nachos last time, which he enjoyed. I am no beer critic, since I pretty much hate it, but since it is a brewery, I can only assume the beer is up to par. The service is also good, and I love how lively it always is, even at ten on a Monday night. I always walk away satisfied and with the confidence that I have not just wasted my money on mediocre food and drinks. Thanks for being a friend, BJ's!

Consistently incredible service and flawless steaks award Fleming's Steakhouse five big ones. I've been to steakhouses all over the country and this place holds it's own with the best of them while not being overbearingly expensive. It's not cheap by any means, and it's got a dash more of the old school cool flare than the modern feel to it, but I don't consider that a particular fault. Few places at this point in time get me as fired up as knowing I'm going to Fleming's for a bone-in rib-eye... that thing is a masterpiece.

Fast, delicious, and cheap. Is this going to be the best Chinese food you've ever had? I doubt it, but in terms of the "fast food" Chinese category it's far superior to Panda Express and various copycats. And with a menu that expands surprisingly often there is bound to be something new to try. The kung pao and honey seared chicken are both mighty nice.

How do you start off a review when you're simply flabbergasted? Liberty Market has flabbergasted me. What a place. It is so unassuming from the street, almost leaving you wondering if you're in the right place, but then you walk through those doors and feel like you've been transported to some magical dream world. Here's a word of warning, I will be gushing until the end of this review.        I asked my dear Kristen to find us a new restaurant last night for dinner, and she, through a very unorthodox way, found us Liberty Market. I asked her if she was sure it was a restaurant and not a market, she said yes, and we were off. While driving over to Gilbert she let me know that the owner of Liberty Market was also the owner of Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill, this excited me to no end because those two places are wonders themselves, masterfully put together and designed, if I may say so myself, and Liberty Market is no different.        Sitting next to a fun water park of sorts (a great place for photography), it is set in beautiful downtown Gilbert, and right when we walked in the door we were greeted by every employee under the sun, it seemed even the chefs ran out from the kitchen to say hello. Now, this was not because it was slow, there were quite a few people there, not quite busy, but hopping for sure, they simply are awesome employees. The atmosphere here is incredible and the interior has a wonderful modern design, there is even a "market" where you can purchase various drinks and old timey trinkets. The salad and bread chefs conversed with us and explained how the market worked, so we sat ourselves down, looked over a menu, and picked our delights for the night.        Kristen stuck with tea, while I had an Anchor Brewing "Liberty Ale" as we began our meal sharing the starter pizza, a delicious, light, grilled flat bread with olive oil, pecorino romano, rosemary and hummus to dip it in. We were already hooked with just the starter. The bread was so good, warm and airy, the cheese had a perfect bite and the hummus was a perfect topper, nothing too heavy and nothing too lite, simply a delicious starter, leaving us ready for the next tasty morsel. I ordered the flatiron steak with chimichurri sauce, garlic smashed potatoes, and fresh from the ground grilled vegetables. The steak... oh boy, the steak... it was so flavorful, cooked perfectly, not tough at all, I'm having a hard time finding words to describe the deliciousness, it was just so good. The chimichurri sauce added a wonderful dimension, it was light but flavorful, never overpowering. I thought the potatoes were awesome, a great blend of big delicious fresh chunks of potato and small hunks of garlic, and the vegetables (carrots and asparagus) had a wonderful grilled taste that brought out their natural goodness. A truly special and wonderful dish. Kristen ordered the liberty bowl with pasta (essentially spaghetti and meatballs) and loved it. The meatballs were big and filling, wonderfully seasoned and cooked. The marinara sauce was done really well, tangy and rich with an intoxicating aroma and the noodles were tender yet had a good bite to them. I am by no means a pasta man, and I thought it was terrific. With every bite, we each were just overwhelmed with our plates. The food at Liberty Market seems to have been very well planned out with careful seasoning and incredible ingredients.        We will be back to Liberty Market, many many times. You simply have to try it, you will see what I mean, see why it's so special. Also, don't leave without visiting the restrooms, all of them, peek inside each one. I love cool restaurant bathrooms, and these are some of the best.

Driving up to the unassuming building on a dirt lot in the middle of nowhere in Queen Creek, AZ, I wasn't expecting much. I even asked my wife if she was sure she really wanted to give it a go, she did, so we walked up, dusted off our shoes, then opened the door to that "HALLELUJAH!" soundtrack heard so often in movies. The smell... oh my goodness that smell. Imagine all of the very best parts of every barbecue joint you've ever been to jammed into one smallish shop, every whiff tantalizing your mind with thoughts of gluttonous rages... it's incredible. The staff quickly do what they can to break your trance, they're used to it by now and very friendly, I felt immediately like family... family who likes each other. You HAVE GOT to try a barbecue burrito if they're available, we not only split three ourselves but also took home four more to give to my family as presents. The jalapeno cream cheese snack sticks are great little munchies and the peppered bacon was without question the best bacon I have ever had, I didn't realize a slice of bacon could be so far superior to another. The prices are relatively low, especially for what you're getting out of it, I just wish it was closer to me... I wonder if a place like this would make it in downtown Tempe...

The lovely Kristen and myself got all dressed up last night and headed for one of my favorite restaurants, Houston's. Geez, I like this place a lot, it's one of the few restaurants where if I had the option, I would eat there every day.         We had reservations for 6:45 and were quickly greeted and sat right down. The place is always lively, always a crowd and always a little noisy, just the way it should be. I got a tasty Jack and Diet and she a glass of white wine as we started with their famous spinach dip. Nowadays it seems every restaurant is throwing a dip of some type together, but none come within thirty feet of the deliciousness that is the Houston's spinach dip. Their chips are crispy and fresh, the spinach dip itself is so flavorful and thick and has big chunks of artichoke in it, it also comes with a side of both salsa and sour cream which compliment the dip beautifully. What a treat!         On to the main course! I moved over to a beer for the entree, Sierra Nevada Heff I think, mighty fine, and the lady stuck with the wine. I ordered the Hawaiian rib-eye (I'm drooling just typing it) and Kristen had the prime rib, both ordered medium rare. My rib-eye was absolutely incredible... the outside simply burst with this delicious Hawaiian marinade, goodness, if only I could describe the flavor, and the inside was cooked perfectly to my taste, the meat was tender and bursting with its own cow goodness. I could only manage one bite before shoving a taste in the mouth of my partner, who also declared it a natural wonder. The steak came with a potato but I opted for fries with a side of homemade buttermilk ranch for dipping. I could write a novel on these delicious fries, but just try them, get a side of their homemade ketchup as well, wow. Her prime rib was beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Cooked very well, lots of meat, tasty, tender and came with a savory au jus sauce, bursting with goodness. She had the potato which came with the prime rib and looked like a football covered in cheese and bacon (not bacon bits, big chunks of bacon), and man was it good. I occasionally wondered if I chose wrong with the fries, but I didn't, shoot, order them both I say!         The only sort of negative of the night was our waitress, she just happened to be new and a little naive, or careful maybe? She was overly cautious about our age, checking our IDs more than once (I'm 28) and forgetting our drink orders twice. I completely forgive this, it was busy, she was new and had several tables, no big deal at all, she was a sweetheart.         If you have never visited Houston's, I highly recommend it, they have many dinner options and even a sushi bar! The atmosphere is super nice and inviting, it is dimly lit and romantic. I love this place. Four and a Half Stars.

The wife and I got a room here for fifty or so dollars a night on Priceline and really enjoyed ourselves. Our room had a sliding glass door facing the pool, a very nice pool, and we could just walk out of our room straight into the water... nice. Our room was nice with a comfy bed and modern design, plus there's no parking fee and it right by Scottsdale Fashion. I would have no problem staying here again for a little getaway, I would always prefer Valley Ho, but if the money isn't there this is my second choice for sure.

Upon entering Riazzi's, Kevin and I were unsure if we had stepped into an Italian restaurant or a nursing home. The patterns on the carpet and booths were horrifyingly dated, and the place was dingy and dark. The only thing that kept me from whole heartedly believing that we were visiting my great grandmother's home was the waiters/waitresses/bus boys playing Rhianna full blast in the kitchen as they talked loudly about their personal lives and friend drama and hair cuts. Food was fine. Nothing to write home about. But the atmosphere, oh gosh. Never again.

I walk in with a ten and walk out full with leftovers for the next two days. That. Is. Awesome. The only time I ever have issues is when I go rogue and try to make my own sauce... always a disaster... but thankfully on the days I'm intelligent I use their guide and it's all good. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because Kristen isn't a huge fan of it, she likes it and all, but I can't give the full monty if we don't both love it. YC's is super legit.

Did I really just pay twenty eight bucks for two small plates of lettuce and two small sodas? Yes I did. And I feel mighty ashamed. Throw in terrible, bleak, sick looking decorations while I eat my thirteen dollar salad and I feel even worse. And add another two dollars if you want chicken on that already pricey salad. I don't know, maybe if you're a slob who takes a dozen trips to the buffet it could be worth it, but I just wanted a salad. I am not a fan.

I hate buying tires. I feel like I'm walking death row as I approach the counter and just wait for some guy to tell me I need two more tires than I thought I did. I will seriously cruise around on a tire I know is bad because I know I have to deal with some smooth talking salesman trying to bend me over. But that didn't happen at this Discount Tire location. I walked in, told them my problem, they looked at my tires and told me why the problem happened and how to prevent it next time, gave me several options for new tires and didn't fuss when I wanted the cheapest option, completed the work and sent me on my way. I'm not trying to say this was a fun experience, I still spent more than I wish I had to, but Discount Tire did have the best prices for my car, and I at least left feeling like someone used lube and had the common courtesy to give me a reach around.

Big, greasy, messy, delicious pizza. Venezias has a nice, large dining room with a bunch of tvs and great food specials and lunch specials everyday. Two huge slices and a drink for five bucks? Best deal in town. Nothing rewards your hard workout next door at LA Fitness quite like heaping gobs of mozzarella... you are seriously missing out if you haven't been here.

I've been spoiled. I hadn't seen a movie at an Imax theater for at least eight years, if not ten, and I chose to make my comeback with The Dark Knight Rises. I honestly had forgotten how grand of an experience it is with its HUGE, beautiful high resolution screen and booming audio... I kept leaning to my wife and telling her how awesome everything was. And while this place isn't perfect, it seems a little rundown or outdated and the seats aren't as comfy here as they are at most Harkins joints around town, I will easily justify the extra five dollars for the awesome experience. This will be my theater of choice for action movies from here on out, seeing them in a normal theater would just leave me wondering how much better it could be the whole time... I've been spoiled.

On January 23rd I received an email from Jiffy Lube with two printable coupons attached, one for $14 off of a signature oil change, the other 15% off any additional service done. I saw this as a good opportunity to get some maintenance done so on January 24th I went to my local Jiffy Lube at the address above, a location I've been visiting since around 2003, and got an oil change and two additional services done. Upon checkout I was quoted a price of 65.63, I mentioned a had a coupon for $14 off of the oil change but was told I could not use it. I asked why and was told this particular store ran it's own special discounts and no others could be used because of it. I asked what the special was and was told it was $10 off of the oil change, I said my coupon was worth more than that and I would rather use it, I was told no. I then said okay, and mentioned my 15% off additional services that I would like to use instead, again I was told no because of the mandatory $10 off that the store had no choice but to issue. I asked why Jiffy Lube would email me coupons that I was not allowed to use and was told "I don't know, that's the way it works".     This is the kind of garbage these oil places get away with every day, and I'm tired of it. For years I've been wanting to review this place with a star or two but ten minute oil changes are so convenient, well I'm done, I'll wait from now on, and my treatment today earned them a complaint with the Better Business Bureau... way to be Jiffy Lube, I hope all of this trouble is worth the four dollars you saved.

Paul's Ace feels much more like a Mom and Pop shop than a big chain. I've gone in with questions about all sorts of varied things and have always walked away with a solid answer and money left in my pocket. I don't feel like I'm ever being up sold or nickel and dimed. The staff is welcoming, the ladies call be "hun" a lot and they have a good selection for their size. I like this place and would come here any day of the week over the bigger home improvement stores.

I could spend all day in REI, it's like a grown up ToysRUs to me. Huge, high quality selection, extremely helpful and experienced staff, plus their awesome twenty dollar for life co-op... fantastic place. Whether you're taking the kids fishing or going on a week long hike up a glacier, they've got what you need.

Listen, we all know Ted's is delicious, it just is, so I will basically shy away from the food and let you know about the service of my most recent trip (last night) to Ted's.    Ted's closes at 9pm on Thursdays and myself plus fourteen friends showed up at their doors at 906pm, we just weren't thinking. We have all had that moment where we feel a little guilty for showing up at a restaurant so close to closing time and you just don't know what you should do, leave or stay, so I asked. I have to tell you, the staff seemed practically excited to see us! After hours! It was a nice change from the usual huffing and puffing I've gotten from similar trips to other restaurants. They were very welcoming and chatty, asking about our night and offering suggestions for our feast, even delivering some items straight to our tables. Service at its best, honestly wonderful.   I've always really enjoyed Ted's dogs, last night I got two regular dogs, one with chili, cheese, and onions, the dog was grilled perfectly with a little snap to it and the chili was slightly sweet with a perfect kick to it, and the other had just their signature hot sauce (a spicy relish) and was just wonderful, I don't even like relish but it was sweet and spicy and tangy... just great.   This trip has made me even more of a believer, no wonder Ted's has been a Tempe staple FOREVER! With service so exquisite and food so good, as my friend Adam said "You simply can't say no to it", I'll gladly spend many more nights in the dog house!

I can't get enough of the Phoenix Art Museum, I come every few months and always have such a good time. I really enjoy the Philip C. Curtis art, it is probably my favorite part of the museum, but the upstairs is also sweet with the more modern/contemporary art and the fun "firefly" exhibition. I also came most recently to a Heidi Duckler event, if you get a chance to see her dance group here I would definitely recommend it. The only issue I've ever run into is obnoxiously loud guests, which is not the museums fault. You've got to come here if you never have, or if you haven't been in a while, it's a beautiful facility with good staff and some schools get you in for free, and with a good sized gift shop with tons of cool trinkets, you just can't go wrong.

I had one cat, and I liked her a lot. I started to feel a little bad though because she was alone a lot. One day my wife talked me into driving to the humane society "just to look". I now have two cats and I like them a lot. The Arizona Humane Society was professional, courteous, and I had a great experience with them. We were given helpful ideas for every aspect of introducing a second cat to the home and drove away feeling confident, and the fact that Sherlock was covered up to five hundred bucks for an initial checkup was a huge bonus, we actually found a new vet because of it. I will recommend the humane society to anyone I know looking to adopt a friend, it's awesome.

Honesty time. I'm a HUGE baby when it comes to anything medical being done to me. Fight an inmate? No problem. Give CPR to a stranger after witnessing an accident? No problem. Get my blood drawn? "Faint". Get a filling? "Panic Attack". Seriously, it's a problem. And Dr. Mason is now my hero.  I didn't go to the dentist for years due to a bad experience when I was 19, but a tooth broke and I was out of options. I explained my nervousness and everything to him and he was an angel about it. He was very patient and understanding and didn't make me feel like a kid.  Dr. Mason has a small and intimate business, I always feel very welcomed and comfortable here, he is a total professional and I'm thankful to have found him.

I broke a wine glass. I tend to do things with passion and last night that led to a broken wine glass. Sorry Kazimierz. Maybe if it wasn't so dark inside. Honestly, it's too dark, my group of six had our phones out all night trying to see the menus, then around nine the lights dimmed even further. I get the point of low lighting, but it's a little much. And the smell by the door really is gross, but once further inside it goes away, no biggie. Those are my only complaints, nothing crazy.  Onto bigger and better things... our setup was awesome, one big comfy couch, one big comfy love seat and one big comfy chair all around a short table. Kaz is intimate and romantic for sure. As soon as my tush hit the couch "sexual healing" began playing over the speakers and I knew I was in for a good night. The music is a perfect level, loud enough to notice but not loud enough to be intrusive and all the staff I had run ins with were very friendly and helpful.  They have a ton of wine, with a bunch broken down into sample flights at a good price. You should definitely try the fondue, it is freaking fantastic, and the antipasto platter was very good, especially the sopressata, but I don't feel it's quite worth the price. If the street tacos are available give them a shot, very tasty pork tacos that melt in your mouth, also the chicken kabobs are certainly worth mentioning.  I will certainly be back, I like it here, it's a good place for a date or to have a more intimate conversation with some friends over wine. Plus they serve Cowboy Ciao's Stetson Salad... can't go wrong with that.

OMG! Fill up my bathtub with the green chile pork stew, I want to lay in it and eat until I'm sick! Really guys, this stew is phenomenal. If I hated, HATED, everything else on the menu, I would still be a regular for the stew... the awesome thing is that I've tried a bunch of things on the menu and liked them all. The fried chicken, delicious Dr. Pepper ribs, pork tenderloin, they're all mighty good. Throw in typically above par service and an awesome happy hour in the bar area and you get four big fat ones.

I have been coming to Don and Charlies for six or so years now and have never had a bad experience. I like it here a lot. The ambiance is just different at D&C, it's upscale but it doesn't take itself too seriously. You could easily spend hundreds on some of the best steaks and ribs you've ever had, but you'll never feel out of place or judged. The sports memorabilia all over the walls is cool even for a guy like me who doesn't care much, it's still rad to look around and think of all the history.     The food at D&C is plain killer. You can't go wrong starting with the simple but tasty onion strings or the baked artichoke dip, while neither is a creative masterpiece, they are done right. I'm also a sucker for a wedge salad and they have a good one with house made creamy garlic dressing. Now, I can totally recommend the coconut fried shrimp, they are tender and bursting with flavor, and the marmalade sauce adds a wonderful tang to it, but you come to D&C for the steak and ribs. I have tried most of the ribs and can only say get them. All of them. Just order one of everything, you will eat every bite of the tangy, juicy and tender but not too tender meat. If you aren't a big rib fan, then you only have one other choice, my favorite thing on the menu, the regular cut prime rib... it is perfect. Freaking perfect. Put it on your bucket list and add a twice baked potato. Period.    Don and Charlies is a red blooded American restaurant, meat, booze and sports are everywhere, and it's a blast. Throw in the amazing food and nothing but the classiest service and I dare you not to have a fantastic evening.

Perfect pizza. Plain and simple, I have had none better. Grimaldi's in Old Town is almost exactly my envisionment of a perfect restaurant. To die for food, a romantic yet lively interior, a great jazzy soundtrack, dimmed but not too dark lighting, professional staff, varied drink list and wonderful outdoor seating. Geez, it's always such a treat to come here. Grab a bottle of wine and and a pesto pizza with ricotta and sausage and soak up the intoxicating atmosphere. Five big fat stars.

Cheap, delicious, and greasy. If that's not a winning combination for a fast food Mexican joint, I don't know what is. Yes, it's pretty similar to Filiberto's and Los Favoritos and Julioberto's and all the other "berto's" around the valley, but Fiesta Burrito shines a bit brighter than most of those in the taste category. I don't live particularly close to this location, but I can promise that whenever I'm nearby it's going to be a huge temptation. Yum.

If you're looking for quick and cheap breakfast, this is your place. Tons of bagel options with an ever expanding menu and some really good breakfast sandwiches. You can be in and out within five minutes with a fresh orange juice and a toasted bagel. I've been coming here for quite a few years now and don't see that changing.

No reason for a long review here, with nearly FIVE HUNDRED of them and a four and a half star average, you know it's fantastic. Wonderful, open atmosphere, several incredibly tasty brewskies, enthusiastic staff and surprisingly top notch bar food... five starskies.

I really want to like Cheba Hut... I just can't do it. I've been trying it again and again for some nine years now and I have decided it's just not going to work. The sandwiches are too bready and often too toasted making the bread hard, sure they have cute little names but they just aren't impressive. I genuinely like the meatball sub... I don't remember what they call it... the weedinator or something probably. But the decor is too much, the weed theme is taken too far, the staff seem to pick and choose who they're going to be friendly to and the food just isn't anything to write home about.

Churchill's is as good as it gets in the cigar biz, don't you just freaking love getting a nose full of that cigar smell as you walk by the old guys out front on any given night? And that's how you know it's good, old guys hang out there. Huge selection for it's size, unpretentious staff, and the kind of look every man wants for his own humidor or cellar. One day, when I'm a hustler, I'm going to get one of those big, expensive smokes and pretend I understand why it cost me so much... can't wait.

Do you have a very late night craving for a slice of cheap and greasy pizza? Gus is here for you. Want some pizza for lunch? Go somewhere else. Want to have some dine in pizza? Go somewhere else... ANYWHERE else. I have had bad experiences with these guys being VERY inappropriate with my better half while we ate there. But hey, if I'm dying for some saturated fat at 3am, I'm still gonna look up ole Gus. 2 stars for being there when no one else is.

HUEVOS RANCHEROS! I must ask my fiancee on every one of my days off if we can go to Harlow's. I just love the atmosphere, kind of a 1950's diner feel with old movie posters on the walls and all the waitresses call you "hun". It's just friendly and very warm. Plus Harlow's is always hopping, it's just the place to be in Tempe, you could run into anyone here.    Harlow's is a breakfast spot, they have lunch, and it's pretty good, but if you want real justice you have to try breakfast items, like the HUEVOS RANCHEROS! Man are they good, by far the best I've ever had. The service is always great, and even though there can frequently be wait times, it's totally worth it.

Oregano's is adorable. When the weather is nice there is nearly nothing better than sitting outside on the little patio with a glass of wine and a pie while Sinatra and Martin serenade you into a drunken bliss. While the menu isn't necessarily groundbreaking, it is mostly very tasty. Their pizza is always cooked well, melty and gooey without being burnt or too crisp. And they don't throw a ridiculous amount of sauce on it, just enough for a tangy bite to fight the creaminess of the cheese. Service is mostly top notch, though being in a college town like Tempe, they tend to have young servers and there can be an occasional miss. If my wife liked Oregano's as much as me, we would both be obese. I love visiting, the food is great, and they have the pazookie. PAZOOKIE. Four Stars.

I've been to Tempe Improv a few times throughout the years, before and after the close, and deciding how many stars to give it is tricky business. I'm a big fan of the venue itself, it's a pretty nice place inside minus the bar area, and it has tons of seating and servers so you can always get another drink or some food without fuss... but speaking of the food and drinks, the prices are obnoxiously high. I really won't hold this against them much, I understand the business of comedy clubs, but geez, you walk out having four watered down jack and cokes and it's $60. I see myself coming here plenty more times, I like it, it's loud and intimate and lots of fun... but maybe I'll start sneaking a flask in.

This is another time I long for half stars. I think Dilly's is better than a three but don't think it quite hits four... such is life. I've most likely had ninety five percent of the menu through the years and have rarely come across something I didn't enjoy. I love the Italian and the Gobbler and Kristen is a freak about their chicken noodle soup. My only true complaints are the interior, often cold and mighty boring, and the staff is hit and miss, most often warm and friendly, but sometimes I catch a big jerk. Three and three quarter stars. I like Dilly's.

Kristen here! I like Rula Bula a lot. Like, a lot a lot. Rula Bula does not at all fit in with the trashy bars and overall poor restaurant selection on Mill Ave. It is a diamond in the rough, and it consistently transports me into a lively Irish pub, filled with authentic decorations and very very good food and drinks. I am not a fan of beer, but I am a fan of this place. Get the chicken pot pie or bangers and mash. You will not regret it. Love this place!

If I was given the option to eat nothing but meat for the rest of my life (and stay healthy) I would do it. And if it could be nothing but fried meat with gravy smothered all over it... even better. Yet here I am at a vegan restaurant... and I ate every single bite of my diablo red... and I'm excited to come back... has Hell frozen over my friends!? I doubt it. I think Green just has an absolutely phenomenal chef. Kristen's secret barbecue chicken sandwich was great too, you basically would have no idea these were vegetarian dishes. While the atmosphere is a little too hippie/hipster for my general liking, the food was really good and the staff were awesome and very willing to help us first timers. You've gotta try this place, if nothing other than to expand your culinary knowledge, but I'd be surprised if you left disliking anything you tried.

Pretty freaking good for a hole in the wall on Mill Ave. I have been coming here for quite some time, and the pizza is consistently delicious. They have a good variety of pizzas, and the slices are quite large. One slice does it for me, and I LOVE pizza. I would consider the atmosphere somewhat dingy and lonely if you happen to be here when it's slow, but I don't mind staying for a minute while I eat a slice of pizza with my fiance. I prefer the outdoor seating if it's nice outside, though. All around great pizza at a good price.

Top's Liquor is seriously on point. They have tons of options, and for the most part it is inventoried in an easy to find way, they have aisles of craft/independent brews, local stuff and hard to find booze. They don't have what you want? They'll get it. And the staff is ridiculously tuned in to their stock. The only reason I can't give it five stars is because I'm scared to death I'm going to bump into an aisle one day and the whole store will come down, expand already fellas!

It's Kristen. I am surprised by many of the negative reviews and am assuming that most of them are from people who are resentful that they didn't buy their clothes. Now don't misunderstand me here - I, too, become frustrated when I walk in with a box full of clothes and walk out with the same box full of clothes, and then see super ugly clothes hanging on display. But it still remains that, if you put some time and energy into your shopping here, some of the clothes you walk away with are awesome and unique. I have one polka dotted dress I bought from here a a couple months ago, and every time I wear it out, I am stopped several times and asked where I got it. Last time, I heard girls whispering about it - confidence booster for sure. Just because the clothing isn't Goodwill cheap, doesn't mean that it's not a good deal. I never feel like I pay too much for the clothing I pick out. Overall, fun experiences at Buffalo Exchange. PS. Don't be lame and buy the TOMS here... totally defeats the purpose.

Chuck Box, I love you. Are you perfect? No. Are you completely sanitary? Probably not. Do you conveniently take credit cards? Perish the thought. But you serve one helluva good burger. Give me a tijiuana torpedo and some jalapeno poppers and I'll forget all your flaws.

I passed right by Lee's Sandwich Shop while driving down Warner to do some shopping. In fact, I'd have to say I've passed by it fifty times driving down Warner. It doesn't stand out, it isn't flashy, it looks like an everyday convenience store. But when I asked my wife to find us a sandwich shop on that fateful day, Lee's Sandwich shop popped up with four stars. This place is very clean, very fast, very cheap, and very good. With a split menu featuring a European side and an Asian side, you'll certainly find something you've never tried or heard of. I recommend branching out, try something new, the barbecue pork sandwich is unbelievable. You will not regret your visit to Lee's.

Lay me down on a bed of Burrata and send me out to sea... I'll die an overly-stuffed and happy man. Add in the best tasting pizza sauce I've ever had, cute and romantic outdoor seating, and a bustling interior bursting with life and you've got a solid recipe for a wonderful four star pizza joint. Can't wait to come back.

One of my top three favorite theaters in the Phoenix area for sure, I have found more gems at Camelview than any other theater. Camelview and Valley Art in Tempe are really the only theaters I monitor on a weekly basis so I don't miss something wonderful. I like the smaller staffed atmosphere and the intimate feeling of the place, plus the seats are comfy and the staff is typically knowledgeable and friendly. The only reasons it doesn't get five stars from me are the tiny bathroom and the *ahem*, older crowd, who very often times can be loud during movies, not the theaters fault, but it still happens.

Every 4th of July you'll find us here, it has become a tradition that we plan to continue for a long time. Watching the fireworks going off all over the city with a glass of wine and a good meal is a pretty wonderful experience. July 4th aside though, the Compass is a bit overpriced, the food is always good, but not quite as amazing as the price would make you think. You're really paying for an incredible (seriously incredible) view and a very romantic atmosphere. The menu changes frequently, so it's hard to make recommendations, but if the lobster bisque is available, get it. With consistently good service, three star food, an incredible wine list and a view that can't be beat, four stars seems totally fair to me. I can't think of a more romantic restaurant in the Valley, and even though it's a little overpriced it's still a place we love to go to make memories.

Ikea is a store I just enjoy wandering around in... forget that they have the cheapest furniture and whatnot around. Forget that they have a million employees who each seem to know everything about the store. Forget that everything comes in little do-it-yourself boxes that I can fit in my wife's Corolla. Forget that despite being mostly made of "cheap" wood, all of the things I've purchased have lasted for years. Forget all that. They get four stars because they let me take naps on the couches.

Yep, Penzey's is awesome. In the spice world it's as good as it gets, one stop here and you'll guffaw every time you walk by a grocery store spice rack. Lot's of fresh spices, some you never knew existed and some you didn't know you can't live without, and many of them are available for your sniffing pleasure. Plus some awesome gift boxes available for ridiculously reasonable prices. With friendly and warm staff, inviting but not overbearing decor and really good prices for what you're getting, I would recommend everyone stop and have a look, I nearly guarantee you'll walk away with something awesome.

So much stuff in such a little space! If you can't find what you need here you're looking for a unicorn. It can feel a little cluttered and at times can be confusing locating exactly what you need, but they have fair prices and tons of inventory. Overall a quite good shop.

This bookstore is the love of my life. I would love to become a children's author someday, so I am always on the lookout for bookstores with a great selection of children's literature. Changing Hands has a wide variety of books and gadgets for book lovers. The shelves are neatly filled with new and used books (used books have colored dots on the binding), and the store is always neat, clean, and full of helpful and friendly employees. I bought a magnetic stand-up board this year with word magnets so my second graders could leave me silly sentences to display. I find this bookstore inspiring and life-giving. They also have a punch card where for every ten dollars you spend, they will stamp the card, and after ten $10 purchases (or $100 spent, for those of you who don't want to do math today), you receive $10 off your next purchase. I also love that Wildflower Bread Company is attached - yum! This is by far my favorite bookstore EVER. -Kristen

When Kevin and I first began dating, about 4 years ago, I did some research to find an interesting place to take him on a date. I somehow stumbled upon this place and so I swept him away on a surprise adventure. Admission was only $2, and we spent a good amount of the day enjoying this relaxing, peaceful garden. We also decided to buy some koi food (also very cheap at the entrance), and we were glad we did. The garden has a large pond running through with hundreds, probably thousands, of koi swimming  in it. They were very lively and hungry. We sprinkled a few pieces of food and all of the koi swarmed over to feast. We had a blast between feeding the koi and walking through the serene garden. We have been back since, and we are still just as happy with it. Do not miss this opportunity to leave the rest of busy Phoenix for a little while to just relax and enjoy the peacefulness of the Japanese Friendship Garden.

Philadelphia Sandwich Company is what it is, available food, but in Old Town Scottsdale PSC is pretty much your only hope if you're partying at Valley Ho and want some grub at 2am. It's typical munchy kind of stuff, too salty and overcooked, and the atmosphere is completely lacking atmosphere, like an old run down strip club. If you're looking for real cheese steak it's worth the drive from wherever you are to head to Forefathers in Tempe, PSC just doesn't come anywhere near making the grade... it stinks that so often being open 24 hours means your food has to be awful.

Essence for sure has the best pastries I know of, no question, five stars for the goodies. The food is also very good, mostly healthy stuff that still tastes great, so four and a half stars there... it only goes a bit South with the prices, which aren't terrible, but a little high for the area, and the decor, which is downright depressingly boring. Bring in a decorator to spruce the place up and I'll be willing to stay and eat instead of taking it all with me. The macarons are worth killing people for!

Kristen and I are practically regulars here. I remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on Yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole "where have you been my whole life" feeling. This place is awesome.      The Cornish Pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be.  The food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews.      If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks. You having nothing to lose.

Love Harkins Valley Art. I would go here over the fancier theaters any day of the week. It's about the service and the intimacy, the employees treat you better here, they seem to want you to have a good experience. I've even had a general manager suggest the best place to sit for a certain movie, or ask what I thought of a movie and gave me suggestions of upcoming films. Pretty sweet.

I hate to bring up a competitor in a review but this place just makes me long for a Harkins. No sweet collector cups, no free popcorn shirts, a most often too dirty theater, underwhelming seats, kids everywhere, expensive tickets, no student discounts, I come here when I have to, that's it.

Kevin and I have been to the Scottsdale Art Walk several times. We enjoy the lively Scottsdale scene, and we feel so welcome by those working in the galleries. The pressure is off, and we are able to really enjoy all the different mediums of art without being hounded by salespeople. We especially love the modern galleries. There are a ton of galleries dedicated to Native American art, which Kev and I skip over, but if you love that stuff, this is the place for you. It is a lot of fun to dress up and pretend like we can afford some of these amazing works of art. Last time I went a bit overboard and wore 3 inch high heels. Never again. With neat restaurants and bars nearby, this is a great place to go on a date (for free) and then end with some appetizers nearby (may I suggest Culinary Dropout?). We will definitely do this again soon, and this time I'll toss my pride aside and wear flats.

The Hotel Valley Ho is a pretty sweet place to stay with a good location in Scottsdale, I've been here a few times and really like it, but it is not without a couple of quirks.     My second time here they tried to tell me they were "valet only", I knew this was a lie, but just told them I would figure it out, they are also kind of high strung about pool access, but you just need an ID and room key to get in. My only other particular problem is they have no wait staff at the bar area, at least not late, I've never been there before midnight, it's a minor thing but really, I don't want to walk to the bar every time I want a drink or some fries, I've had a hard night.     The good news is that the rooms are awesome, I love the modern/retro blend and think the big tubs with "mood lighting" and the ridiculous shower heads are amazing. The grounds are beautiful with bright green grass everywhere and the layout and design of most of the hotel are straight out of a Rat Pack how to book. The beds are super comfy and the original buildings have balconies with lounge chairs.     Even with some negatives, even with a valet staff that flat out lies to me, even with a fairly high price, I love coming here and look forward to every opportunity. Something about this place is so fantastic to me, if I figure out how to explain it I'll update my review, but with it's close proximity to all things Old Town and minute walk to the great Trader Vics, I hope I have a chance to stay here again soon.

Binkley's was an incredible experience of a night that I can't seem to shut up about. I'm telling any sad schmo who happens to make eye contact with me for too long about it, regardless of if I know them or not. We had the pleasure of dining here on Valentine's night and the place was busy with laughter and chit chat, just about the perfect amount of background noise to accompany our evening. I won't begin to even attempt listing the 15, 16 ,17, or so plates that were brought out to us, nor the several drinks we had, plenty of others have well documented each and every dish... I'll keep this nice and simple. Me and my wife had an unbelievable evening, we ate every morsel that came our way, drank every drop we got our hands on, laughed, talked with staff, and enjoyed ourselves immensely. Without question, you need to come to Binkley's at least once, we have already had several conversations on when we could come back, but do yourself a favor and experience Binkley's at least one time.

Want to drink and not end up in jail with a DUI? Light Rail. Want to go to a D-Backs game and not fight traffic, pay for parking, or end up with a DUI? Light Rail. Want to visit the Science Center, Art Museum, Mill Ave, or go to First Friday and not end up with a DUI? Light Rail. The Metro Light Rail in no way helps me commute to work or do anything particularly serious with my life, but four dollars for an all day pass that takes you to a dozen cool places quickly without using any gas and gives plenty of people watching opportunities? I like it.

This is my local branch, it just happens to be within walking distance of my house and it just happens to be awesome.

Now don't let my profile picture fool you, I am not, in the traditional sense, a Mexican. Shocking, I know. But, I do know my Mexican food, and Los Favoritos is awesome! Wonderful in fact. Delicious, cheap, clean and delicious.    This morning I got a bacon breakfast burrito with beans inside, and if you don't know, their breakfast burritos are their bread and butter, the money maker, and they never disappoint. The only problem you may ever have is the bacon being a little salty, and even then the always incredible hot sauce (or salsa, whatever) is there to save the day. The carne asada is very good, seasoned well and almost always very tender, the beans, which are cooked with wonderful, wonderful lard, are always just firm enough, never just a pile of mush, never watery, the chicken is juicy and tender, I just can't say enough about it. The only negative I have is that one of the counter girls is a bit rude, and there is a military service recruitment center right next door, so at times you may be bothered a little by them, but come on, they're serving our country, so it can be forgiven.     Los Favoritos is the best fast Mexican restaurant that I have discovered so far. Do yourself a favor and give them a visit, at either location (Tempe, Chandler) and tell them Kevin sent you, they'll probably just look at you funny, but why not?

I get so excited when we're on the way to Costco, you'd think I was headed to a theme park. It's such an adventure going down the aisles and seeing what's new or what kind of samples are out. And if you're in the mood for booze or need some gasoline you just aren't going to find better prices. A majority of the staff seem to have been with Costco since the 90's, so they are professional and knowledgeable as heck, and this particular store has a great floor plan that flows really well. I'm a big fan.

Club Tanning was the site of my very first bed tanning experience, and I'm very happy to say that it was pretty sweet. Katie the desk girl was great, answering my hundreds of questions cheerfully and being totally helpful without attempting to sell me anything I didn't inquire about.     The salon itself was clean, and the prices and products were laid out very plainly. On your first visit you fill out one sheet of paperwork warning about medications that can cause a bad reaction when tanning, then you choose your desired package and are given a room number. The rooms are simple, they have an empty lotion bottle that says the room has been cleaned, a couple of towels, a pair of those little goggle things, a chair, a mirror, a fan and some headphones for your music of choice. You push a button on the wall that turns the bed on and starts your timer, then lie down or stay standing for your desired time and you're done. Clean up and leave, they'll even hold your bronzer or whatever you have if you'd like.     This is my first membership to a tanning salon, so I can't really compare prices, but it seems fair to me, I think unlimited tanning starts at 30 a month, or you can pay for each visit standalone.  I know this seems a little long winded, but I went in to this totally clueless, so if you're new to tanning I completely recommend Club Tanning, the staff is helpful, the salon is clean and the whole first time process is as simple as it could be.

I had always seen Gene's Auto Worx at the top of the Tempe Yelp list with five stars, so when my Lincoln started acting up, I knew where to take it. I had some mystery noises coming from under my car, the problem was it was on and off, with me never knowing when it would happen.    I went to Gene's and sure enough, no noise, but Gene hopped in the car and I drove around for ten minutes, then Gene drove it around for a while, trying everything to get some noise. Nothing. We drove back to the shop and Gene had my car put on a lift, all the wheels taken off, did several inspections of every part that moved, they easily spent an hour inspecting my car... and nothing. They took my car off the lift and Gene told me if I ever hear the noise again to come to his shop and he'll drop what he's doing and hop in to listen for it. I thanked him for his kindness and pulled out my wallet to hear Gene say there was no charge! Seriously?! They most likely spent a total of two hours on my car and he wanted nothing... that's unheard of.   In the end my car got fixed, for WAY less than I expected, and I left very happy and very loyal to a new car shop. Who knows if I would have found Gene's Auto Worx without Yelp, and I recommend them to everyone I know, I couldn't be more pleased with the service I received.

I've now been to Gene's Auto Worx several times for preventative maintenance and emergency type fixes with my Corolla and Lincoln, and each time I leave pleasantly surprised with the level of care I receive. You learn so early in life to distrust car shops and it's such a breath of fresh air to be able to drop a car off and know that there isn't someone actively thinking of ways to screw you the whole time your vehicle is in their care. Five big fat stars.

My soon to be wife and I had our first date here, I won her over with pizza and had her take a slice of cheesecake home for her Mom, that's how you do it boys.  While this location isn't quite as "jazzy" as the Old Town spot, it is still awesome and has, in my opinion, perfect pizza. Yep, I've eaten at pizza places all around NYC and the country in general, and Grimaldi's is my favorite. Coal-fired, thin crust perfection. Throw in a good mix of old jazz music and a good wine list and you have a recipe for awesomeness. My fave is the pesto pizza with ricotta and sausage... heaven. They have good salads too, but who cares?  The Chandler Grimaldi's is fantastic, four stars for sure, but if you have the option, hit up the five star Old Town location in Scottsdale, but you can't lose either way.

Oh man, no chance of me coming back here... The bathrooms were a disaster, complete with creepy guy smoking some drugs in a corner stall, and it was eerily empty, like end of the world empty, I like a bustling theater experience. So much was wrong... no student discount, no collectible cup, less than comfortable chairs. They're just lucky they have self validation, the only true joy I got out of that experience was not having to pay for parking or track down someone to punch my card. Two awful stars.

One day, about three years ago, I wanted some fries. I wanted them badly. After a while on the internet I found that Joe's Farm Grill supposedly had the best fries in town, so I went, expecting nothing more than some good fries. What I got, was an almost religious experience. I am now a convert to whatever this Joe guy is selling.    Joe's Farm Grill is so grand, in fact, that I find it kind of hard to review. A delicious, locally owned restaurant that was featured on Food Network attached to a beautiful farm where they grow their vegetables, plus an award winning cupcake/coffee shop and some of the coolest bathrooms I've ever seen. I could write three pages on it! But I'll make it simple, because there are plenty other reviews to look through. I have never had anything less than great here, whether you're looking for a burger and fries or some ahi tuna, Joes is here for you like a charismatic cult leader. If you haven't stopped by Joes, punch yourself in the face, then head on out.

I like cupcakes. My fiancee likes cupcakes. And so we both like Sprinkles because they have cupcakes. Good cupcakes. I just wish they were cheaper, like a dollar, because then I could eat a hundred cupcakes because I have a hundred dollars. Their salty caramel cupcake is my favorite cupcake.

Being down the street from my house I can't even count the number of times I've been to this theater. It's a solid, clean theater with big restrooms and the huge Cine Capri. We've had nothing but pleasant experiences here. Bright screens, booming audio and comfy seats. Five stars for all of the awesomeness, minus 1 star for the standard, ridiculous snack prices.

Very underwhelming... I used to really like Juan Jamie's, but now that I've experienced Canteen on Mill Ave I realize it's just not that good. The margaritas are pretty weak, the chips and salsa or chips and whatever you might order are grossly overpriced and the tacos are just not all that flavorful... totally "meh" in every way.

Meh, indeed. The food at CPK is typically good enough... not really good, but good enough, The interior is cold and makes me kind of tired,,, it's just too boring and safe. Even the bar area just seems weird, like a hotel bar with worn out businessmen. Plus they make you beg for bread, CPK is a big chain, could giving out silly small portions of bread really be bankrupting them so much that they make you ask for some? Throw in the expensive for what you get price tag and I throw in two boring stars. Meh.

I know it's a chain. I know it's a fast food burger joint. I know they have a small menu. I know. But damn, is it good. And damn, do they try their hardest to make fast food with quality ingredients. And damn, do they serve the heck out of anyone who walks in their doors with a smile. These four stars come hard-earned.

My local bar, Boulders is a four minute walk from my house and I love it. They have a very large and always changing beer selection and a great crowd every night to hang out with. This is not a college bar, you could run into anyone here, young or old. The food is good, but it is bar food, this is not a gourmet spot, but I love their big freaking nachos and fish n chips. My only particular gripe is the jukebox... the music is either really good or it makes you want to leave... but with the best happy hours in town and friendly atmosphere, it's a very minor complaint. I am here at least every Thursday night with some pals and I don't see that changing any time soon.

Yum, yum, yum. We like to stop at this spot every so often and it's always very good. Their gelato is super flavorful, they give you big servings for the money, and the decor is neato. Sitting on the patio while people watching and snacking on gelato during the cooler months is a welcome treat.

I wish I could live here... in fact on my last visit I was thinking about how I'd like to be in World Market during the zombie invasion, whenever that happens. They just have so many wonderful things that I want to eat and drink and play with, seriously, every visit here is like a brand new adventure. If World Market wasn't quite as pricey I would give it five stars, but don't let the four fool you, I love this place.

Dang I love Tempe Marketplace. They have it all, a huge plethora of stores to choose from for your every need. The place is kept clean, they always have visible security and there aren't ever a bunch of homeless kids running around being ab noxious. From the upscale steakhouse to the pottery painting store, I love Tempe Marketplace.

Forefathers is great! I went there yesterday and was greeted at the register by the owner who chatted me up for a few minutes and suggested fry dipping combos for me to try, I can't say enough about the staff, great people.    Yesterday I had the original and a side of sweet potato fries. The original is a 9 inch (I think) roll with sliced rib-eye, grilled onions, and cheese whiz... holy cow, it was delicious. The meat was tender, not stringy or chewy and had enough flavor to make it through both the cheese and the onions, which were just wonderful icing on the cake. The roll was firm enough to hold up to all the juices, yet was soft and tasted very fresh. The sweet potato fries also blew me away, they were not overly fried by any means, just enough to be hot and steaming and were wonderfully sweet. The owner convinced me to take a side of honey mustard to dip them in, and it was a terrific choice. The dressing added a little sweetness, but the mustard added just enough tang to produce a delightful symphony between the two. Yum.    I strongly recommend Forefathers, I have been several times and it is so good each time. The decorations are interesting, the food is delicious and the staff is attentive and extremely friendly and helpful. Go. You'll thank me.

While I'll outright admit that I'm not a coffee guy in general, I'll also admit that I love Cartel's iced toddy, and for a man who doesn't enjoy coffee to be semi-addicted to a toddy it must speak something to the quality. The atmosphere is calm and inviting, it's nice and dim and really welcoming on warm days, and they have lots of comfy chairs and games to play if you aren't there to be productive.    Cartel has somewhat recently opened a small brewery at this location, which of the brews I've tried have been good, not great. There has never been anything wrong with a beer I've had here, it just hasn't been killer... and if you aren't doing something new or spectacular, why do it? Cartel's chai is a wonderful and refreshing drink and while I've had a couple of misses with their pastries, most have been tasty.    Cartel is simply an institution in Tempe at this point. And while it isn't perfect and sometimes the line is crazy, it is a great place to sit and hang or grab a nice drink for the go.

My cat has the herpes. The Herpes! And before you go slandering her good character, herpes in cats is like a cold, not an STD, quit being so judgemental. So our cat was sick and we didn't know why, Dr. Gus laid out all of the possibilities and talked us through each one and why he did or didn't think it was her case, and her case was the herpes. After telling him to go ahead and put her down, he explained it wasn't a big deal, it would pretty much seem like she had allergies, so I let her live and now we have a happy cat. Dr. Gus and his assistant were great to us and treated our cat well and with dignity even when they shoved something up her rear. Hopefully she will be happy and healthy forever, but if anything ever does happen we won't hesitate to come back. I was kidding about putting her down by the way, quit being so judgemental.

BevMo is my number two choice for my boozin needs. This particular location has a very good party scene selection... thousand packs of Coors Lite for two dollars and things like that. But they also have a pretty good selection of craft brews and local stuff. Plus lots of options for the harder liquors and pretty fair prices. I'm honestly a bigger fan of Total Wine, the interior here is somewhat hospital like, but they still have some good stuff and knowledgeable staff.

Oh man, most likely the best meal as a whole that I've ever had was here at SushiSamba. My group of 12 went with the tasting menu that was recommended by our waiter where they bring out a bunch of plates and will replace anything that you don't like with something new. A list of things I remember being placed in front of me: Otsumami, Salt and Pepper Squid, Berkshire Pork Gyoza(maybe the best thing I've ever tasted), and a large variety of sushi. Everything was dynamite. I don't like to gush in my reviews, and this place already has a ton of great, informative reviews, so I'll leave mine where it is, but I'm going to have a hard time finding a restaurant that beats SushiSamba.

"I wish I could take a bath in that macaroni" is something that was definitely said last night by one of us, probably me, I can't really remember (very good wine). Anywhooooo, Cork is awesome. Kristen found it a while back and suggested we give it a go, and after several months of waiting, last night was the night. We arrived at 630 to find the place was relatively packed, maybe a table or two empty, and were escorted straight to a huge booth by a friendly hostess.      Cork is located in a strip mall, but don't let it scare you, because the front door of Cork is like a magical portal. You walk through this very unassuming door, in this very plain looking building, located in this very boring strip mall and you find yourself suddenly faced with a beautiful, modern restaurant, complete with a huge wall of wine that demands your adoration. The atmosphere here is great, it has a nice ambient back round noise, the colors are calming and the drinking water has cucumber in it. Cucumber! Brilliant and delicious.      Onto the main attraction! Our awesome waitress (name?) explained that the portions are somewhat smaller, and that most people walk away very happy after each having an appetizer and an entree, so we did just that. We started with the Cork's mac and cheese and the cured meats. The cured meats were good, prosciutto, sopressata, salami, gorgonzola, it was all quite good, but the mac and cheese simply destroyed it. Go get this right now. Go. I'll wait. Ok, see? It was freaking fantastic. Bbq pork belly, smoked bacon, wild mushrooms, four year aged widmer's cheddar... oh my goodness, I considered canceling our other orders and getting seventeen orders of it. But enough gloating for goodness sakes. For le entree, I ordered the organic lamb chop, two beautiful pieces of lamb cooked wonderfully to a medium rare, with a little more rare than medium, and it was divine, just bursting with flavor. It came with a lamb shank pot pie that I don't even want to try to explain, it was heavenly. Gosh this place is good. Kristen ordered the grilled prime strip, it was scrumptious and had a great sauce, I think it was a diablo sauce, that made the flavor really pop. On the side was a summer squash bread pudding that Kristen thought was ok, but I ate it up, I wish I could have that recipe, so wonderful. We had an incredible time, the food was great, the service was great, the wine was great, we will be back, this is one of my new favorite restaurants. Nice work, Cork.

Maybe two and a half stars... maybe. The food is just nothing spectacular, the restaurant looks kind of thrown together and in the summer it's hot inside. WikiWiki is so close to my house that I really want to love it, but the passion isn't there, things seem rushed. I'll keep coming here occasionally because it's so close and my only Hawaiian food fix, but I really hope it gets better.

The Keg gets it right in so many ways, after Houston's this is probably my favorite steakhouse, which is nuts it being a chain and all. The ambiance is calming and romantic, dim lighting with a giant fire and professionally clad waiters, it's almost always booming yet never all that loud. I've had a lot of their menu over the years and still haven't found something I didn't like. Their prime ribs are incredible. Get it rare and just let all that wonderful juice run down your chin... they also have huge potatoes plus some great appetizers like the tempura asparagus, scallops and bacon and escargot. The only thing really lacking here is the beer selection, just the basics around The Keg. But with dynamite service, dishes you'll be licking clean, and an atmosphere that'll put you in the mood, The Keg earns an easy four stars.

The blankets and towels over the windows just weren't cutting it anymore. I heard about New West through a radio program, Rosie on the House, and after weighing just doing it myself and after comparing them to a couple other companies, I went with them and I'm glad I did.  New West is basically a Mom and Pop shop, the owner, Rod, came out to my house for the initial consultation, then showed up with his wife on installation day and they knocked it out quickly. I have a brick home, which is kind of a nightmare to install blinds in, and they handled it like pros, some of the installation took some pretty unique problem solving, they worked hard and got it done.  New West was not the cheapest company I found, but it was very fair, and like they say, you get what you pay for. I recommend them highly, support your local business!

Look, As You Wish is plain fun. I'm not an artist and I'm not particularly creative, but each time I go, and I've been a few times, I end up staying way longer than I expected and creating a piece that's way better than I thought I had in me. I understand that some of the bigger pottery is mighty expensive, but grab something medium sized, bring a bottle of wine or a couple of beers (yep, BYOB), and spend an afternoon or evening there. Make it worth the money. This location also has some exceptionally talented and helpful staff. If you're a man in need of some brownie points, this is a great date location, just have fun with it.

Cafe Monarch lives up to the hype. The courtyard is a perfectly romantic setting, the food is divine, the service is solid, and the price is well within reason for the experience you get. I will be regularly checking the ever evolving menu and coming back as much as I reasonably can. This is an oasis in the desert, I can't believe I waited so long to try it.

Free books, free movies, free newspapers, free magazines, free drinking fountain... this place is great! Sure there's a couple people who aren't quite "homeowners", but they still have helpful staff, a clean building, and plenty-o-inventory. Five big ones!

How can you give "A Mountain" less than five stars? It just sits there all mountainy for your trampling pleasure. Walk it, jog it, photograph it, it doesn't complain. It just wants you to be happy. This is one of those little pleasures that help make Tempe awesome!

Take all of the stars! I will do my best not to gush, but know as you're reading this that I'd gladly gush if I thought it was appropriate. To have Posh listed as a restaurant is almost a travesty... Posh is an evening... it's a life moment... one of those AHA! type situations where you finally understand just what kind of an experience dining in an establishment can bring. When the very first course, which wasn't even a course but a "palette cleanser", was one of the best things I had ever eaten in my entire life (and mind you, I've eaten at some of the finest restaurants Napa, San Francisco, and our wonderful own Phoenix have to offer) I knew my concept of food was about to be destroyed... After three or so hours of small dishes that consistently blew me out of the water, I knew that I could never eat anywhere else... money keeps this from actually being true, but how do you go back to your homemade turkey sloppy joes after having sweet breads for the first time? While this may not be my most informative review to date, I urge you to try Posh out... Kristen G. and I cannot wait to come back, and we want to bring everyone we know... it just seems wrong for people to be eating Long John Silver's and Hot Pockets after seeing and tasting our menu at Posh... the damage is done. We'll never be the same.

So, you choose your own flavor or flavors of yogurt from several different options, you choose any and all the toppings you want from several different options, you can sample all the flavors you want, AND you choose exactly how much or how little you want to pay on that particular trip? Mind blown.

Kristen here. Let me preface by saying that the food is absolutely 5 star worthy. I have only had the teppanyaki experience, so my review is for only that. The fried rice is to die for, and I usually get the filet. It is so so so very good. Since you are seated 8 to a table, regardless of how many you came with, the wait between ordering your food and actually receiving it after the show can take up to an hour. If you are hungry right now, don't go here. However, if you can wait it out, it is absolutely worth it. The show/presentation is hit or miss. Usually it's pretty good, though. They do the same tricks each time, but it is always so fun to have kids at the table and watch their expressions. It is an overall fun experience, as long as you come when it is lively and full. It's no fun if you're the only ones in the establishment. Also, my sister used to work here, and they were a little bit shady with her pay and her boss drove her to a different location on her first day... weird. Hon Machi only gets a high review from us because the food is killer. I would come here over Benihana any day of the week. However if you are looking for the better *experience* then I think Benihana may be a better choice for you.

Kristen and I stopped here on a whim, we were just hungry and had no idea where to go, and essentially we thought the sign looked cool.  Bluburger is pretty great, our waiter explained the process they use, choose your meat, bread, toppings, sides, all that stuff, then a few minutes later you have a delicious burger in front of you. I had a black angus burger on a wheat bun with goat cheese, caramelized onions and chipotle mayo, holy cow, I can't wait to have that again. Kristen had some kobe beef burger that was also amazing, The regular fries and sweet potato fries were both very tasty and we had some great service. They have wonderful milkshake options too.  I hope Bluburger lasts and is able to branch out to Tempe, with solid food and great service, it would be happily welcomed.

Holy up-sale city! The store is clean, the staff is friendly and accommodating, but man, let me be. I don't get who decides that customers would like being hounded about this that and the other thing, but I just came in for my phone. It just makes me feel like they looked at me and thought "This guy's a sucker". Not a fan.

I feel like an alcoholic when I visit Total Wine. I really don't drink much, maybe an average of a drink a week, but when I walk through those doors I'm like a kid at FAO Schwarz... I want everything. The bottles all gleaming under the lights, the thousands of selections tempting my every step, the ridiculously helpful staff around each corner explaining every product down to its molecular anatomy, those little price tags that seem too good to be true... what else do I need to say. Five stars.

The beauty of Taste of Tops is truly in its simplicity. You have a well lit and inviting atmosphere, plenty of seating for it's size, a big fridge with hundreds of bottles of beer to choose from, and a TV screen displaying what's on tap at the moment. That's it. And with it's great pricing and minimal staff you have a home-run. No one is going to hover around your table asking if you want another round or try to rush you into making a decision about what to drink, you're free to relax, browse, sip, talk, laugh, whatever you feel at the moment, and it's wonderful. With all the emphasis lately on fancy bars and old timey drinks, you forget how great it can be to sit down, uninterrupted, and just have a beer.

Lobbys is great. I give the establishment itself three stars, it is very boring inside and atmosphere wise a little cold, but the burgers, oh baby the burgers are an easy five stars. These big, juicy, sloppy sandwiches are so freaking good. Get a double with cheese and bacon and indulge.

I'm a big fan of Jimmy John's. This location is a mile or so from my house and is on constant standby for nights when the wife and I are out of groceries or are too lazy to cook. We get out the computer, punch in our order, wait fifteenish minutes, and the food is at our door. It really doesn't get much easier. I love the ultimate porker, with flavorful ham and salty bacon, it hits the spot every time and always makes me wish I had three more... add onions and avocado to it and I'm drooling. If you visit the store be warned, the music is loud and the staff is at times in such a rush that they almost seem unfriendly, but that's the point of the place, a ridiculously wonderful sandwich at lightening speeds, and that's exactly what you'll get... they may not win awards for service, but man is that a good sandwich.

I had been wanting to try Culinary Dropout for a good while, last night the opportunity finally struck and I was not let down. Kristen and I went with our three favorite couples to celebrate an engagement, we decided to arrive at six thirty because they do not take reservations (I will never understand why restaurants choose to not accept them). Once seventy five percent of your party is there you get a little buzzer and your name on the list.        We found our friends sitting at the outside bar and joined them for some drinks. The bar is pretty awesome, there were several bartenders, so you never needed more than a little eye contact for quick service, and they have a ton of beers and specialty cocktails on the menu, from fruity and sweet to harsh and alocoholy. The seats were fairly plentiful and comfy, and there are also lounge seats all around the bar area for the outside dining, I thought the layout and design was attractive and used the limited space wisely, I'd love to come back for an outside lunch. The bartenders and waiters were friendly and attentive, all good looking (of course, Scottsdale) and all of our drinks (from beers to martinis to fruity stuff) were delicious and not too overpriced, I mean, they were overpriced, but not quite Scottsdale overpriced. So far, so good. We paid the tab and headed inside.        The atmosphere inside is awesome. I hope to someday open a restaurant, so when I enter a new business I eat it up, I devour the place, I pick apart the ambiance, the lighting, the noise level, the architecture and design, everything, and I really like Culinary Dropout. The tables are huge, slabs of hard, rough wood, very rustic and western, it is dimly lit with modern (not too loud) music playing, there is a surprising amount of room and lots of space for big party's, they have a stage for live music (awesome), Culinary Dropout really surprised me.        I will spare critiquing each meal and just stick with Kristen and I's, but just to be fair, two in our group had the beer battered fish and chips, one had the pub burger, one had the fried chicken and two had the shaved prime rib dip, and none complained.        Our group shared both the house potato chips, which were very tasty and fried just right, and the onion dip was flavorful, not some run of the mill dip, and the soft pretzel and provolone fondue, which was fantastic. A pretzel is kind of a pretzel, they were good, soft and all, but the provolone sauce simply exploded, man it was good, creamy and tasty, you should definitely try it. I ordered the fried chicken, which was delectable, it had a great but not overdone crunch, it was sweet and you could actually taste the spices, not just the taste of the fryer, you also get a lot of it, three big, juicy, tender pieces. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy which was good enough, nothing special, but only had two bites in it, and two very small but scrumptious biscuits with honey. Dear Kristen had the shaved prime rib dip which was fine, a little disappointing I guess, just not much meat, the meat to bread ratio was severely lacking, and it came with fries which were very good. If you're really in the mood for a prime rib sandwich, head to Houston's.        I will be back here for sure. I paid for Kristen and I, plus the newly engaged couple, and including drinks and all food it only came to ninety eight dollars, that is a bargain for this atmosphere and the overall quality of the food and staff. It also only took us about an hour to get seated, eight people on a Friday night in Scottsdale with no reservations? How can you beat that. Culinary Dropout is simply awesome.

I've visited the museum twice now, once when it first opened and again a few days ago, I like it. While it is true that a lot of the exhibits have pretty similar takes on different instruments, that kind of seems like the point to me. If one country made a trumpet out of antlers, another out of wood, and another out of brass, it's pretty cool to be able to see and compare each of them. The technology for the headsets works very well and is pretty genius, just walk up to whatever you're interested in and it plays for you, I didn't even have to strain my finger pushing a dumb button! My only wish is that the play room would be expanded a little bit, the theremin is fun to mess with, but that's really the only unique instrument available. And I wish there were a few more modern exhibits, something involving The Rat Pack or death metal or whatever... Taylor Swift is cool and all, but it would be nice to have more. And no student or military discount is ridiculous, that alone will keep me from ever giving the Musical Instrument Museum five stars... but everyone should see this place, it's huge, beautiful, and clean, minor issues aside it's a great way to spend an afternoon.

This is the only urgent care center that I trust at this point. I have now been here three or four times and while I've always driven over with a slight sense of dread wondering about the wait and how attentive the care will be, I always leave lighthearted knowing I made a good choice. The front desk employees are kind and welcoming and all of the doctors I've seen so far have been incredibly knowledgeable and more than ready to answer my questions. I've been to urgent care places all over Tempe and I confidently hang my hat on this one.

About once a week I would find a cockroach somewhere in my home, maybe the kitchen or a bathroom, and it may be alive or dead, but I was tired of it. And I really didn't want my fiancee, who was about to move in as my wife, to have to deal with it. Yelp pointed me to Lights Out, so I called Jason up and a couple of hours later he was at my doorstep.     Lights Out Exterminating is a local business owned and operated by Jason, the guy who will come to your house and get rid of whatever it is you need gotten rid of, and he is completely professional and very customer service driven. He taught me things about what was going on in my house, pointed to certain "trouble" areas that I could seal or repair and explained what the bugs are attracted to. He did a very thorough search of my home and landscaping, was friendly and outgoing, and charged me significantly less than I was originally quoted. Long story short, he found exactly where the cucarachas were hiding, treated the area, and within two days I cleaned up around forty dead roaches and have seen absolutely none since.     With exceptional service, great prices, no contracts and a friendly owner, I have no problem recommending Lights Out to everyone I know.

I sure am glad my roommate told me to check this place out. Kristen and I stopped by RnR the other day for a late lunch and happened to get there just in time for happy hour, my beer was less than her tea, awesome. I love the look of the place, the front door is huge and sweet, and while the inside is on the smaller side, it doesn't feel packed, and there is ample seating outside, I can't wait for the cooler weather so we can stop by more often and people watch.      We started with two appetizers, the pigs in a blanket, which are the old childhood favorite with a light and flaky pastry crust, they were delicious, and the chicken lollipops, super tender on the bone chicken with buffalo sauce, so stinking good. We then shared the pork sandwich, which had a sweet and tangy sauce that complimented the tender pork wonderfully, it was a terrific sandwich and came with a bucket of fries.      With crazy hours, good drink selections and a great happy hour, RnR is definitely worth checking out, I wish I had came here sooner.

Medium rare, cheese and bacon, blood soaked bottom bun, perfect. Zinburger is awesome. I've yet to find a burger I haven't liked but I'm partial to the Sam, don't overlook the chicken sandwich however, it is super tasty and all of the fries are on point. Where else can you go and stare a giant cow in the eyes while eating his family? Incredible shakes, fair beer selection, cool atmosphere, four stars.

With constantly changing flavors and owners who aren't afraid to experiment with odd combinations, how could you not love it? You get what you want, pay what you want, and get to interact with helpful and friendly staff. Who could complain?

I saw a billboard advertising the Arizona Sea Life Aquarium on the way to work and knew I had to go there. I love new things, exploring and having adventures, so yesterday Kristen and I headed over to Arizona Mills Mall to see what was what.        Walking up to the bright blue building, we were certainly apprehensive, Arizona Mills has seen FAR better days after all, and we didn't know how big an aquarium in a mall could be, plus, $18.50 per person? That seems a steep price, we walked in expecting fairly big things. After a young staff member (they were all very young, 16 to 18) takes your cash, you are walked over to an optional "funny photo" green screen, something like being eaten by an octopus or chased by a shark, we hammed it up and came out with awesome photos, but there is never an option to buy them. And if there is, it is an extremely well kept secret, because I looked everywhere and even talked to the girl showing the photos, not that I would have bought one, I'm just saying it's odd.       The aquarium itself is neat. There are lots of tanks, lots of fish, you can pet a starfish, and I saw a jellyfish for the first time, they are awesome, but the staff I encountered were pretty bad. Very uninterested, very bored, very tired of kids and questions, only talking if asked a direct question, it was just bad, and we went on it's third day of being open, what will it be like in a month? A year? And yes, it was full of kids, and yes, the bad parents were super annoying letting their kids scream at the top of their lungs and slap the tanks with all of their little might, but we expected that and were overall able to stay away from them.       I guess to break it down, I may give the aquarium itself 3 stars, it was interesting and fun (though we have fun anywhere) even while being geared so much towards children. But adding in the price and the staff, I would almost say I'm being nice giving it 2 stars. If they dropped the price to 10 or so dollars, I would tell everyone to go and visit it, but nearly $20 for about an hour of wandering around with nearly no help from any staff? I would much rather visit the zoo, even during the hot Arizona summer.

Delicious donuts, awkward place. To quickly break this down, the donuts are four, maybe even five star worthy, but the inside is just cold and boring and sometimes there are shady people sitting around staring at you... BUT, the owners are awesome and kind and there's always the drive thru. I really won't get my donuts anywhere else nowadays. If you want to go to donut heaven, pop a glazed in the microwave for a few seconds... you're welcome.

After leaving Seattle I went looking for a new tattoo shop to call my own, and though it took years, I've finally found it in Golden Rule Tattoo. The shop is simple and clean, the guys are all very talented and make you feel like family. Alex Empty has given me two beautiful tattoos and I'm working on some more ideas, but I wouldn't hesitate to go to any of the fellas that work here. I tell everyone I know to check Golden Rule out, even if you think you like another shop you owe it to yourself to see what else is out there.

Review #100           I knew I was coming up to the century mark here on Yelp, and I've been trying to think of what I'd want my hundredth to be... something different for sure... but I just wasn't coming up with anything. Then, on some random night, Kristen and I head out to Ted's Hot Dogs and there I see it... completely unassuming and somewhat hidden, a sign that reads "Beaver Choice". Remembering seeing it on Yelp a bit lately, I ask if we can, she nods, and we're off. Beaver Choice is one of those culinary miracles that I'm so glad I stumble upon occasionally, and I knew as soon as I left that it must be the illusive "hundredth review".          From the moment we walked in we felt like family... I'm a little surprised I didn't end up getting a hug, the people who run the establishment are bright and chock full of attitude, quirky attitude, if you don't have a lot of experience with people from different nations you could possibly see some of it as rude, just toughen up people, unless you're doing something silly, all they want to do is serve you well.          The atmosphere is nothing amazing, this is not The Palm, but it is very homey, it feels like you're walking into someones dining room. A lot of the furniture and dining accessories are from Ikea, which is cute because it's from Sweden, and they have a bunch of games you can play while you wait, they aren't trying to pretend they're a quick restaurant, everything is fresh and can take a while.          The food! The food is amazing. Everything I've had from the coleslaw to the potatoes to the meatballs has been wonderful. I wholeheartedly recommend the pork schnitzel cordon bleu, this thing was so simple and tasty, it's not some over-sauced or over-seasoned dish, it's fresh, quality food that speaks for itself without being covered up by a million ingredients. Also high on the list are the supremely flavorful swedish meatballs, get a chunk of meat on your fork, plow it through the potatoes then dip it in the lingonberry preserve and let me know how heaven was. The coleslaw is not your typical slaw, it is house made and much better, the thyme potatoes came in a huge portion and were delish, and the tomato basil salad was tasty even to a guy who hates tomatoes, like me.            I'm not sure how much more I could drool over this place... huge portions, very good food, fair pricing and amazing staff. Beaver Choice just has it all.

Artie came out to my house for a garbage disposal install that I couldn't get done myself for a few different reasons, he was courteous, kept my house clean, played with my cat, troubleshot my problem and charged me less than originally quoted. No complaints here.

A great local cafe with deliciious sandwiches and drinks? An awesome, laid back atmosphere with furniture you can purchase and tables handmade by the owners? Friendly owners and kind staff? Oh and it's cheap too? Yes please.  Try the white boy torta or the stacked philly sandwich. And the honey latte and italian sodas are fantastic. Support your local business!

I love it here and it just keeps getting better. Not only have they started serving wonderful Cartel Coffee from down the street, but they are finally serving beer and wine too, and while the beer selection is not huge, the choices do not disappoint. They have revamped their entire menu and bar area and have just made constant strides to get better and better at serving people. If you haven't stopped by yet or for some reason had a less than stellar experience, you have got to give it another shot.

Canteen is my new favorite happy hour spot. You can get two orders of wonderful pork and habanero tacos, two orders of their tender ribs, an order of quite good chips and guacamole and a couple of margaritas for around twenty bucks, it's amazing. Add in the cool atmosphere and HUGE selection of tequilas(all half off during happy hour) and you have a recipe for success. Canteen is a very welcome addition to Mill Ave, and while it can get very loud, you simply cannot go wrong during happy hour.

Another fantastic Yelp find! Beckett's Table was different right away, as soon as my group of eight sat down our waitress told us to relax, take our time, choose carefully and ask all the questions we wanted. You could tell she wanted us to have a great time, she had no desire to rush us and fit in another group, it was refreshing.     Beckett's Table is elegant in a simple way if that makes sense, it's not super dim lighting with expensive leather everywhere, it's lots of wood with an exposed ceiling, but still, the decorations with the big windows and warm color scheme mix perfectly and light the room up.     Appetizers are king here. The entrees are good, and I'll get to them, but they are a shadow compared to the starters. I began with a lovely drink, the classic painkiller #3, a pina colada but better type drink, it is delicious and fruity but started to wear a little towards the end of the glass, very sweet, we also tried flinn's dilemma, kind of a mojito but tasted mostly like lemonade, it was fine. We began chow with the salmon/potato/corn/spinach enchiladas, which are good as long as you like smokey, kind of chipotleish flavors, these are very strong and filling. Also, the cheddar biscuits and mac and cheese with pancetta are on point, both super tasty and good portions for just five bucks. The grilled cheese with tomato soup however is freaking amazing in my mouth. You are seriously missing out if you don't try this cheesy, pancetta packed appetizer.     Entree time. We tried the b burger, which got pretty general "it's good" reactions from everyone, but being fair we had recently been to Zinburger and, come on, who can complete with that? The chicken and dumplings were good but there was nothing exceptional about them, I would rather see some kind of a fresh take on a pot pie, there were no complaints, just no raving either. Two people got the green chile pork stew and liked it, but again no shouts of praise and adoration. I asked our waitress to bring me whatever she would order and ended up with the wood fired mussels, a big bowl of big mussels and four fairly large slices of garlic bread. The mussels were good, hard to get out of the shell but meaty and tasty once in your gullet. The broth in the bowl was tasty for bread dipping, but a little too sweet for my tastes, and the bread itself was good with a semi sweet garlic spread on it. Overall a good and hefty meal. We also tried a couple of deserts, the coffee creme brulee was delish but too coffee strong for my buds, the peaches and cream was a hit and the chocolate dipped bacon smores were a little chunk of heaven... big slabs of chocolate covered pig with toasted marshmallows, graham crackers and creamy peanut butter, for only six bucks you HAVE to get this dessert.     With strong service, nice ambiance, great starters, great deserts, good drinks and fair prices, Beckett's Table earns a strong four stars from me even with the somewhat lackluster entrees. If the entrees do pick up sometime soon, or I find one that blows me away, this could easily end up a new favorite restaurant of mine.

Men, is it time to pop the question and give your future wife a ring that will drive her friends insane with envy? Women, has the question been popped but you've been presented with a ring from Jared or Costco or some other place where a million other brides will have the exact same design on their finger? Well look no further than a wedding ring workshop at Harold Studio. How could you possibly give your future spouse a more awesome, meaningful, and unique ring than one you literally made from nothing with your bare hands? Short answer, you can't.     My wife and I spent a few hours with the owner, Johanna, melting, bending, pounding, learning, and laughing, and at the end we had wedding rings that people simply don't believe we made for each other. Literally no one in history EVER has the same ring as either of us. Just let how cool that is sink in for a minute. I'm as far from a creative or crafty person as they come, but Johanna is such a great, calm, and caring teacher that it all fell into place and I popped out a sweet ring for my love.     Seriously, call the studio, set aside an afternoon, bring a bottle of wine (I don't really know if you can, but it's worth a shot), and design and produce a statement of love for each other that will never be produced again. It's mind-boggling just how cool this is.

Great, unintimidating lounge area, fairly large selection, good prices, and friendly staff. I really enjoyed my time here and got to meet some nice regulars. Fox Cigar Bar is a pretty good distance from me, but I'll certainly do my best to make it here regularly.

It's like your own little Wonka factory on Mill Ave! Ok, so not quite as grand, but it's still a fun little shop with super friendly employees! Candy Addict has lots of your favorites and most likely a few you've never tried, plus a bulk candy section and it's all at fair prices for the specialty store that it is. Support your local shop!

A little piece of heaven for me. Sinatra over the speakers, a Rat Pack movie projected on the brick wall, a beautiful cigar on the table and some bourbon in my glass. I'm really not sure how much better it could have gotten.     I came to The Napoleon Club on a Friday at 8pm, the crowd was just starting to pick up so we chose a sweet setup outside and planted our flag, my party of nine stayed here for four hours on a beautiful night. The Napoleon is class, class, class, everything is beautiful and well laid out. They have a large selection of smokes and booze, the only weird thing was that, at the time, they didn't have a menu with everything on it, like every cigar and every alcohol option so you could just choose, it was more about suggestions, but they said they were working on a comprehensive list type menu. The service was incredible, our servers name was Jess, ask for her, and the general manager Joey made several stops at our table to make sure everything was great. The live band was super talented and entertaining and was never too loud or distracting.     Now, the place is expensive, not outrageous, probably about what you would expect it to be. A nice cigar will run you twenty bucks and and the drinks are around ten. And no food, although I was told you can have an outside vendor bring food to you, I didn't get too into it, but call and ask if that interests you. And the air filtration system apparently works because I thought I would have to get my suit dry cleaned and it doesn't really smell at all, and I spent some time inside, you can smell the aroma of cigars around the inside, but you don't smell smoke, pretty cool.     Look, I felt like a king, it was wonderful. I left very happy with everything that went down. If you need to unwind with some friends or just want to try a sweet new place, The Napoleon is here for you, you won't be disappointed.

I have had nothing but great experiences at Citizen Public House. While I'll start off by saying that I know some of the items can be a bit overpriced, or possibly a lot overpriced, I'm taking into account the expensive Scottsdale location, and expensive real estate and booze licenses, so I will largely overlook it. Everything I've put into my mouth from here has been phenomenal, but I'll only really point you to one item, the meatloaf, it is unbelievable. I will judge every other meatloaf I ever meet against the CPH meatloaf. They also have inventive drinks, they even got me to enjoy gin, and I hate gin. The interior is nice, hip/modern, with an open feel and a nice bar as the centerpiece. I can't say that I'll be a regular here anytime soon, it's a bit of a drive from my house and there are other places that are basically as good but cheaper, but you can count on seeing me here from time to time, smile on my face and meatloaf in my mouth.

I'm so happy Mellow Mushroom opened up a block from my house! I've watched it being built for a few months now with promises of great exotic pizzas and fifty draft beers and I couldn't wait to try it. Kristen and I showed up at four thirty(I have a very early work schedule hence the grandparent like dinner time) and we were greeted by a bunch of enthusiastic employees, it was fun, they must have had all the employees on for the opening. The Mellow Mushroom is sort of eclectic inside, a mix of modern style with urban influences and some typical pizza parlor flair. It was welcoming and they played a wide range of music from the rat pack to techno. They also have a cute little store where they sell their shirts and pint glasses and whatnot. Okay, it being the opening we relied heavily on our great servers advice, he suggested the pretzes to start so we ordered half cinnamon and honey, and half garlic butter and parmesan. It came with six HUGE pretzels, three took up a large pizza tray, we had no idea they were so big. Kristen liked the sweet ones more and I liked the garlic parmesan, but both were great(and with half off happy hour they were only three dollars!) We then had the Kosmic Karma pizza, we made some substitutions suggested by the server and ended up with a 14" olive oil and garlic base pie with mozarella, spinach, feta, roma tomatoes and pesto sauce. It was wonderful, every ingredient brought something great to the table and the crust was awesome. The pizza is not cheap but not over the top expensive either, it makes sense, they use very good ingredients.  So to sum it up, we really like Mellow Mushroom and will be back. From the wonderful happy hour(half off all appetizers and most alcohol), to the large beer selection with a bunch of local brews and the delicious pizza, we are pleased to have this new pizza joint in the neighborhood.

I have recently lost about seventy pounds and I take my rare chances to pig the eff out very seriously. I typically go to a frozen yogurt place and make myself sick with mini peanut butter cups, but ever since discovering Churn, I can't make a trip to the area without being tempted. Churn has a bit of an eclectic mix of different sundaes and floats that make me want to try something new every time, my favorites so far are the smores and Elvis sundaes, the Elvis being my newest finding and its mix of salty and sweet is mind blowing. This place is worth the extra notch in my belt, if it was a bit cheaper it would hit the five star home run, but I can't in good conscience give a perfect rating to a nine dollar sundae. Churn, me and all of the personal trainers out there getting business from the bad decisions made in your shop, love you.

What the heck? What happened here? It says "Same Slices" on the window, looks identical to Slices inside, it even still has the newspaper cutout of when Slices opened at Tempe Marketplace... this is no Slices though... It feels different inside and the pizza isn't quite as good. I'm so confused. I miss Slices.

I am excited about NCounter. For a long time Harlow's has been the only great breakfast joint near me (Mill Avenue area), and though I would be happy to eat there every one of my days off, Kristen doesn't like it much, NCounter to the rescue!     Located super conveniently off the light rail and within walking/biking distance of my house, this new breakfast/sandwhich shop is a humongously welcome addition to Mill. Modern and clean inside with tons of windows and gobs of natural light give a really welcoming feel to NCounter, and the outdoor seating will soon be regularly utilized by yours truly. Walk up to the counter and get a screwdriver or bloody mary, order your food, take your table marker, and admire the surprisingly cool art or watch the foot traffic while you sip and wait.     The food! The menu doesn't hold any big surprises, pancakes, french toast, eggs, and a mostly common run of sandwiches, but man is the stuff delicious. Like the chipotle egg burrito... knocked my little socks off. I honestly cannot wait to get back and have another one of these, the way the avocado and eggs mix perfectly wit the chipotle sauce and cheese, this bad boy was great. And the french toast here is probably the best I've had, no wimpy wonderbread here, so don't be afraid to order a more "boring" meal, the traditionals are done right.     Look, I'm always scared of new places opening up on Mill... I was with Canteen and I am with NCounter, even places with wonderful ideas and well executed food can mysteriously fail on Mill, but I have faith in NCounter. It's just plain good. Our most recent trip here was without question five star worthy, and if things stay on the up and up here, I'll be back in no time with a five star update. You just need to come try it... Mill Avenue is slowly making its comeback.

NCounter is still here and still awesome. After initially being nervous about it's well being I feel comfortable giving it the big five stars and a lot of my love. I have been here a ton of times since discovering it and have had nothing but good experiences, NCounter is my favorite breakfast spot.

I'm not sure if I have ever had such a delicious frozen treat in my mouth. Everything I've tried has been a hit, but the banana with rum was utterly dreamy, bursting with sweet flavor and more creamy than I thought it could be. The interior is very simple but hey, go in the evening and take your dessert to the outdoor seats and people watch while you drift into a delicious diabetic coma... totally worth it. Bottom line, while somewhat pricey you can genuinely taste the quality of the ingredients, and I'm going to have a hard time ever walking around on Mill Avenue again without stopping in for a frozen snack. I'm addicted.

I sure am glad Fallout Games wasn't around when I had more time on my hands, those guys would think I had no life with how much I'd be hanging around the shop. They have NES, SNES, Genesis, all kinds of systems set up and ready to play and take you back to your childhood. They sell used stuff for really good prices and are very friendly, even to nine year olds who stand around asking fairly dumb questions. Fallout Games will be my go-to spot for my nostalgia fixes, and certainly my place to go when I really do decide to start snatching up NES games from my childhood, this place is great.

Three and a half stars rounded up. Slickables is simple, choose your cookie and your ice cream, pay, eat. It's cheap and delicious with freshly baked cookies and Dreyers ice cream, I just wish the interior was more put together... it isn't very inviting or well decorated.

Yup, trusting Yelp with this recommendation was a fantastic idea. I was in Arcadia and wanted Italian food, nothing specific per se, I just knew I wanted something Italian and North was one of the first restaurants to pop up. After conferring with my dinner party of four, we were off.    We started with a pitcher of the best red sangria I've thus far experienced, winey yet fruity, spicy but mellow, it was good. Then we moved on to the mussels, which the table unanimously agreed that, even though between us we have eaten seafood all over the world, were the best version of any of the mollusk family we had ever eaten. Served in a butter sauce with slivers of garlic and salami, these things were damn near worth five stars alone. You must try them. Next best was the ricotta gnocchi, which although were very slightly doughy, had an incredible flavor profile with the horseradish sauce and ricotta. The seared diver scallops were also a hit, the scallops seared very well with a good cook, the risotto was tasty but got to be a little much at the end, it had a LOT of flavor. We also got a margherita pizza with a white sauce instead of the red, it was a good pie with a crispy crust and nice bite. The spicy shrimp dish was the low of the night, it did have a nice flavor but was just kind of a run of the mill pasta dish, I'd go with something more adventurous.   The fantastic food, incredible service(Stephanie I think), and inviting decor push this place over the top. North will for sure be in our regular rotation of restaurants from here on out.

As annoying as trying to find that one perfect home can sometimes be, John was beyond patient and accommodating. He found us a great home near ASU and went above and beyond with his suggestions on the remodeling we were thinking of doing, steering us more towards what will help with resell value in the future. John was open and honest with us every step of the way and even gave us some aid in claiming our first home refund for our taxes. I cannot recommend him enough and pass his info on to everyone looking for a home of any type. Do yourself a serious favor and go straight to the best with this guy.

I had an amazing experience buying my home with the Gluch Group, so when I got a wild hair and was thinking about selling my home to move into a condo, I gave them a call. The first and only condo I chose to look at was perfect, nice size, red brick, and a great location. John showed me the condo, thought it was sweet, and we sat down to talk numbers. John told me he would love for me to get the condo, but that it would be wrong for him not to at least go over the market data with me, and as it turns out my home was appreciating basically twice as fast as the condo would have. At the end of the day I stayed with my home, but that's a big reason I recommend the Gluch Group to my friends, coworkers, whoever. They could have easily just gotten me into that condo, but they did the work and were honest and gave me the information I needed to make the best choice.

Manuel is the man. I had a cheapo chain link fence in my backyard (it was an emergency fix type thing), and needed an eighty foot or so by six foot block wall to replace it. He and his crew were courteous, clean and stayed within budget. I got a better price than I was expecting and am thirlled with the completed job. You can't go wrong with these guys.

Yep, this place is wonderful. When my wife and I were searching for massages on Yelp, Thai Royal Massage was near the top of the list and I'll admit, I was slightly apprehensive... yoga mixed with a massage? I'm not particularly flexible and was thinking it might be a hindrance or even painful... and watching some YouTube videos just made it worse. I knew I couldn't do some of the things the people I was watching were doing, but my wife insisted that they would know what to do and where my limits would be and like usual, she was right. I loved it. I was pushed and pulled and sat on and squeezed and squished, and I walked away wanting to do it every week for the rest of my life. This form of massage will without question increase my mobility and it feels so wonderful and is so relaxing to boot. I can't believe I almost passed this up.

Tough Mudder 2013 in Mesa was a fantastic event. I was part of Team Troy, probably the largest team at the event, and I cannot stress enough how much more fun and rewarding Tough Mudder is with a good team. The event is well organized and seemed as safe as it could be with medics clearly visible at nearly all times. Fellow Mudders were very supportive and helpful and never in too big of a hurry to aid someone in need. I really have no gripes, I didn't feel overly pressured to spend extra money or participate in any of the side events going on. I had a blast and can't wait until next year. If you're on the fence about doing a Tough Mudder you have to come out and try it. It's hard, but so worth it.

Kristen G. and I freaked when we saw a new donut shop opening down the street from us... I can't say that we're obsessed with donuts or anything, but we get these ridiculous cravings a couple of times a month and swiftly polish off half a dozen each while watching Extreme Makeover: Weight Loss Edition. Arizona Donut Co. is owned by the same people that brought us Bosa Donuts, which in short means the donuts cannot be beat. Service here is always very quick and extra friendly, the prices are reasonable to cheap, and it's open twenty four hours a day. The only thing keeping away my last star is that we tend to show up late night, three or four a.m., with our mighty cravings, and more often than not they are out of a couple of things. While this is forgivable seeing that they aren't getting a lot of business at that time, I wouldn't feel right giving it a full five stars when we sometimes have to settle for a slightly less delicious sugary treat. I sincerely hope this place is around a long time.

Stopped by the tasting room last night with a group of nine and had a great experience. While I do love Four Peaks on 8th, it can sometimes be so crowded with college folks that it becomes annoying, and if last night was any indicator of the general crowd of the tasting room, I'll be trekking over here fairly regularly. They only serve beer and wine, all of Four Peaks' brews plus a guest tap or two and whatever concoction Four Peaks is currently working on, so you need to know that you like their stuff, plus no food, so bring your own. But in terms of it being a relaxed atmosphere to put down a few and enjoy company in peace, it's the place to be. You'll find me here from time to time playing Elder Sign or some other nerdy game for sure.

Incredible service, very friendly and kind. Tasty and quick food for cheap, a must for all dog fans, especially if you're a former Michiganer.

This Panda Express is newly built and recently opened. The outside looks great, very modern and well designed, it really sticks out and gives the place an inviting feel. Inside it's very clean and well laid out with bright lights and warm colors. Although very busy the couple of times I have visited so far, my order has been taken promptly and served up in no time with friendly service. I'm not going to be coy about feeling weird giving a Panda Express four stars, but along with the above mentioned things this location is doing right goes the food. I've been to malls plenty of times and gotten Panda Express for this reason or that, and the food here can't be compared. It all seemed fresh, hot, and well flavored. While I'm skeptical about the quality maintaining it's present state, I still have to be fair to what I've observed so far. Four stars... for now at least.

Immaculate service. I had a somewhat oddball cd request that, while they had in stock, was not in it's proper place. The guy helping me searched high and low, was really friendly and outgoing, and even enlisted the help of other employees. He made it feel like I was the only employee in the store, and like finding this cd was his life goal, it was wonderful. After, sadly, not being able to locate it he made some calls and arranged to have his friend stop by the Chandler location and bring their copy of the cd over to this store. Dang. Color me impressed.

I know, I know, it's a fast food restaurant that pretty much only sells chicken and has lately been under fire for the beliefs of it's owner... I know, and thankfully however, I don't care. When one of the sweetest and most excited people I run across all day is a teen-aged girl working at a fast food place, I know they are doing something very well. I'm happy to have this Chick-fil-A move into my neighborhood replacing an ugly older burger place, the building is modern and bright with an eye catching design to it. The In-N-Out of the chicken world, Chick-fil-A is as good as it gets quality-wise for fast food, I've had a few things on the menu and they've all been tasty, and they have without question the best fast food breakfast lineup. I don't eat this stuff too often, but I'm sure glad to have this as another option for myself and the rest of Tempe.

Woah. As much as I love the Tempe Cornish Pasty, this location kills it. It's a stark contrast, the Tempe location is dark and divey while this one is very open, lots of windows and natural light with a clean and welcoming feel. The new menu options are a great addition, and the design and layout are slick and eye catching. As much as it irks me to say it, I'd rather drive the ten minutes to this location than go to the one within biking distance of my house. It's like I was dating the Tempe location, but now that I've met her sister in Scottsdale, I think I'm in love.

I hate thrift stores but I love animals. See the dilemma? If shopping at a store that carries items donated by some higher end consignment places will help care for homeless animals, I'm in. The place is pretty big, carries a large variety of stuff, has good prices and great sales, and has solid staff, several of which are volunteers. Stop by and help some furry fellas.

Fractured Prune is not the place you run to at 11pm to grab a dozen cheap donuts to fill your late night cravings. They cook to order, use better ingredients, and cost more. Makes sense right? I am positive I will be back many times in the future, and if a location opens up in Downtown Tempe I'm in trouble. They don't have the quirk that VooDoo Donuts has, but they are sure fresh and tasty.

Holy cow. I never would have imagined a sandwich shop could blow me away the way Ike's has, but here we are.      The menu is expansive... like HUGE, with a ridiculous amount of options to fully include vegetarian and vegan, plus the staff I've encountered so far have been friendly to the point of a bit of fawning happening. The portions are ENORMOUS, I'm a big fella and can only eat half of a sandwich, thankfully they are delicious heated up the next day, and if you go during happy hour you get free chips and a drink with you sandwich, dope.      I discovered Ike's on Sunday, came back again Monday, and fully intend to try to convince my wife to go again today (Tuesday). You are missing out if you have not been to Ike's yet. Seriously

Huge fan of the Foxdale location. The selection isn't quite up to snuff when compared to the Gilbert location, but they still manage to have lots of good stuff including some htf items, but beyond the specific number of sticks this location blows the other out of the water. Lots of booze choices, clean and comfy seating, solid staff, great air cleaners. I'll be a regular here for sure.

Harkins Theatres are just the best theatres in general in my opinion, cheaper tickets than most, student discounts and the incredible cup and shirt deal make for a pretty good experience every time. This one is at a mall in a pretty boring city, so you may very well have some teens in your theatre, but aside from that an all around good place to catch a flick.
