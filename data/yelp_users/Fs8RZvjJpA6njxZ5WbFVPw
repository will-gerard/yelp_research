A great thing about Serranos is how quick the food and drinks come out! This tends to be a spot we go to on Friday nights! They have a great house margarita!As soon as you sit down you are greeted with chips, salsa, and bean dip! (all very good) Then you order and bam your food is ready within 20 minutes hot and fresh. We've tried several things here tacos, burritos,chimichangas, fajitas, and enchiladas. The only thing I didnt like was the fajitas. They were overcooked and the meat was chewy! The only downside to this place is that when the snowbirds are in town its impossible to get a table before 8 pm.

This is one of the only sushi bars I go to! First off the service is normally great, aside from the female bartender that has way to many tables to stay ahead. (She is very nice but needs help in the bar area) The sushi is amazing! The sushi chefs are very talkitive and friendly and happy hour is to die for! Down side...aside from the restaurant needing a 'hip' makeover I cant think of any! Go here if you want some great sushi! Manager is very nice!

Love this place if you are in the mood for some BBQ! All I can say is try it all! I always get the stuffed baker with either chicken, pork, or sausage links! Add some corn on the side and you have yourself a great meal!

The best part of this restaurant was the awesome decor! There was a massive replica of the United States which was fun to look at! Other than that the food was sub-par. Our table ordered chicken noodle soup (which was good), a burger (that was overcooked, chicken tenders (that were more like chewy chicken nuggets), and biscuits and gravy that were okay but were luke warm. The service was bad. The location and lack of a wait time where a plus but we obviously know why there wasnt a wait time.

My husband and I go to Oregano's all the time! We love the place! We tend to order either the meatball or Italian sandwich, thin crust pizza (because it doesnt take 45 minutes to make), gold wings, or the vino bambino salad. (just depending on our mood) The biggest upside is that the food is great! They have a wide variety of options so its easy to please everyone. The down side is if you dont get there before the rush you will wait 2 hours for a table. Now I love the food there, but I wont wait 2 hours anywhere to eat!

I have been eating at Rudys for a little over a year now and we continue to go back! The best thing on their menu is breakfast! We always get the chorizo burrito and its made to perfection every time! Weve had the breakfast tacos before which are average but it has fries in the actual taco which is cool. We have tried dinner there twice and it was gross! Each time I couldnt believe it! So what Im saying is that Rudys is the best breakfast burrito place in east mesa! Id leave dinner to someone else.

There isnt much to say except that everything is great! My favorite is a barbacoa salad, brown rice, black beans, pico salsa, tomato salsa, sour cream and cheese! I say keep coming back and try new things!

We love the Cheescake Factoy! I wish it was little cheaper but you do get a lot of food and normally get good service! This time we ordered crab and artichoke dip to start which was great just a little small. Then we got a cheeseburger which was tasty as ever and we got a soup, salad, and sandwich combo. There was soooo much food! The caeser salad was okay, but Ill probably just order the house salad next time. The soup was a lentil soup which wasnt my favorite and the chicken salad sandwich was fantastic! They have a pretty cool bar area!

This place is what you except with some awesome decor! I will say it is quiet and far enough away from the casino that you can actually relax at a meal with out all the hustle and bustle. The menu was some what limited but everything we ordered was good! We ordered breakfast and a Philly cheese steak. I think Id order this again! The service was average, took a good amount of time to get refills but other than that Id recommend it.

Get the smoked wings! Go now...really...they're great! The have decent beer prices, good burgers, and pretty good service. I'm glad we came across this gem. A great place to go for Sunday football.

My husband and I went here one Saturday night and it was empty (should've known)  However, the servers and all workers were very nice- although the actual service was average at best. We ordered brisket, pulled pork, and prime rib. Everything was dry except the brisket. The BBQ sauce was average- not good or bad. The sweet tea was good but the server never put ice in the tea so it was luke warm. The Mac and cheese was good. The cream corn was gross. Overall, I wouldn't go back. We spent way to much money for a below average meal. ($50)
