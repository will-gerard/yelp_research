Searched yelp for a Father's Day prime rib treat and found this spot and decided to give it a chance . Upon walking to the salad bar I noticed an open grill that had some sausages searing and putting out a pleasant Aroma . I felt I had made a good choice ..The Prime rib was on point along with the baked potato and salad . I will definitely be back to explore some more dishes .

Me and My Girlfriend have searched for the best pizza all over the valley for over a year now . We have paid high dollar at several fancy spots and she was not impressed with any of these popular suggested places .I said what the hell were picking up a sack in Tolleson anyway we should try it and what do you know it is her favorite place .We drive 15 minutes out of our way Flipping off Pomo  Red Devil and all the other spots we had tried in the past .The Dough is crispy yet chewy inside .Sauce and cheese on point to compliment the righteous  crust .Wings are slightly crispy and drenched in a legit sauce...Dip those bad boys in buttermilk Ranch and you're set .

This review is coming from a new vegetarian who grew up eating amazing Mexican food cooked by my Nana in a town with great authentic Mexican restaurants . So first our sever who did a pretty good job brought out chips and salsa . The chips were good but salsa was pretty lame and reminiscent of pace picante sauce (mild) . My girlfriend and I  shared  veggie enchiladas , A veggie burrito and a side of rice and beans . The veggie burrito which we ordered enchilada style lacked flavor even after drenching it in a salsa I paid extra for . The rice and beans were on the same level as the veggie enchiladas . You want to know what that level is ? Well I guess it's best compared to the Mexican food I had at Disney land to be nice . Nice atmosphere though .
