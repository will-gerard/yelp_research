There's something deliciously seventeen about drinking in "The Alley."  Of course, real seventeen year olds can't get in.  This place is legit, but the vibe is very Lloyd Dobler in a gas station parking lot asking a bunch of punk kids why he just can't win with women.  (Don't worry Lloyd none of us really have that figured out and most of us who seem to be doing it successfully are really just faking it.)  The crowd here varies but I have always felt welcome.  Drinks are ok.  Sometimes they're great but it depends on who's tending bar.  The good thing is they're fairly cheap.  As a music venue I give it  high five.  It's dirty and dark with a one foot high stage that's obviously meant for performance but not so far removed as to make you feel like you're not connected to what's going on.  The sound is ok.  It depends on the show really but I've always had a good time and that counts for a lot.  I like the pictures on the ceiling. They're fun to try to decipher when you're setting yourself on spin cycle.  The pool tables are usually full so I can't really vouch for them other than to say that they're popular.  All in all, it's a decent place to pummel yourself in the face with your beverage of choice.

The time was 4:30am.  It was dark and a little chilly with the sun not yet up.  Perhaps that's why they call it Black Friday, but my money was on the delicate hint of malice in the air as I stood shoulder to shoulder with  veteran soccer moms with steel and fire glinting from their eyes, Scowling teenagers and college students bubbling with nervous energy and the occasional hen-pecked dad who got talked into dealing with shopping insanity as some sort of a special treat before trudging off to the salt  mines for the day.  There were at least five hundred infantry ahead of me and five hundred behind me and our numbers kept growing.  There were scattered bits of conversation but most of us were silent, contemplating the chaos we were about to charge into for the sake of our families, our friends, our lovers.  But mostly for the sake of savings.  We glanced ahead and behind, sizing up the competition, mentally calculating our strategies for navigating the battlefield.  We were at least a battalion strong.  Perhaps a regiment by the time the doors would open.  And it would be every man woman and child for themselves.  Occasionally, someone would open a wallet or a purse, checking and rechecking their ammunition, occasionally running a finger along the edge of a bank card or bill to make sure they maintained their razor edge.  Slowly, we began to march forward and the slow but steady trudge was a stark contrast to the sense of frantic urgency that crackled in the morning air.  Not all of us could walk away victors, but all of us were determined to try.  Then something happened.  Something I would have never expected.  As we approached the double glass doors, we were greeted by another army.  With their bright blue uniforms, they could have been UN peacekeepers.  They handed us each a large plastic bag and ushered us into the store with bleary eyed smiles.  The fear and tension started to lift.  I have been at Toys R Us on Christmas eve.  I have seen the very worst of Holiday spirits and I was ready to face them again all for the sake of an (CENSORED) that (CENSORED) just had to have.  Yes the store was crowded.  But there were so many helpful, indeed cheerful sales attendants on hand that most of us shoppers just melted into a gentle wave of requests which were quickly and cheerfully met before anyone could get bent out of shape or stressed out.  A sales clerk simply asked me to wait for a moment while she located a reserve ticket for the doorbuster item I had stood in line for.  One minute and fifteen seconds later she returned with a document which guaranteed me my desired item at the desired price to be delivered to me as I left the store.  Another clerk helped me locate the other items I needed and I was done with my shopping within ten minutes.    Of course it took another hour or so to work through the serpentine line at the checkout but all of us were so relieved at how painless and indeed bloodless the shopping experience had been. We were more than happy to stand in line waiting for the opportunity to plunk down our hard earned cash on the latest objects of technolust that had caught the eyes of our loved ones.  We left tired.  And we left poor.  But I dare say most of us left happy and for that Best Buy and the entire Best Buy army have my eternal gratitude.  Thanks for taking the ass out of Christm.

I'm wary of anything that tries to pass itself off as "Nawlins" style food.  Mimi's may be a chain, but for all that, the food is quite good and reasonably priced.  If you're feeling the urge on a Sunday, let me recommend you call ahead for takeout.  They do a wonderful job and it will travel at least a good 15 minutes without becoming too cold.  Hey if you want to go spend your time waiting with all the other people in their "I just got out of church" outfits, go right ahead.  I'd rather book it to a park than stand around waiting for my name to be called.  You'll find the usual heart attacks on a plate for breakfast which is my favorite thing to order here.  Personally, I'm a dirty little whore for the Pain Perdu.  Is it the french toast? The cream cheese? The marmalade?  Taken separately, any one of these is a temptation that can be resisted.  Throw them together, and I would totally stick check your grandmother and mine if they were between me and my Pain Perdu.  Hyperbole? Perhaps, but I'm telling you -  This stuff is love on a plate.  LOVE.  Get it inside of you.  It will make you giddy.  Better looking, smarter, charming, successful.  Or at the very least fat.  I could talk about the deliciousness of the Crab Cake Benedict, The Breakfast Quiche, the fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice, but I won't do it.  That would only distract you from the Pain Perdu.  Lunch and dinner are acceptable.  I like the salads, and the frisco burger, but there's nothing that really gets me all hot and bothered the way the Pain Perdu does.  Say it with me, "I'll have the Pain Perdu"

I was so excited to finally try the place I ended up being early.  We paid our admission to the food funhouse that is YC's and then got down to business.  Armed with bowls the size of our heads, we stepped to the buffet and I got my first look at what I was up against.  The first third of the buffet is filled with shaved curls of frozen meat in various varieties.  Beef, Chicken, Pork, Alligator and Yak.  Frozen curls of Yak!  Okay so I lied about the Yak and the Alligator.  But you never know.  They SAID it was beef and chicken, but seriously, it could have been Yak!  I grabbed the tongs and threw a pile of meat in the bottom of my bowl.  I smiled at my accomplishment but she just looked over slightly concerned and then handed me a sheet of wax paper.  "You need to smash it down." she said.  "What?" I replied? "The meat," she explaind patiently.  "You need to smash it into the bottom of your bowl."  "But I'm not that hungry!" I protested.  "You will be and this is gonna last you for days.  See that guy on the end? Your bowl is supposed to look like that." She pointed towards the end of the buffet where I saw a towering mass of vegetables rising out of an already unfathomably large bowl.  It would easily feed a family of four.  His YC fu was impressive, but I was sure I could top that.  "Get Smushing," she said as I refocused on the task at hand.  After I had pressed all the pretty curls of meat into a flat unrecognizable blob that filled the bottom half of my bowl, we moved onto the vegetables.  If you've had it in "Chinese" food, it was there.  I zeroed in on some celery, cabbage, bean sprouts, carrots, scallions and baby corn.  I piled it on with gluttonous abandon, gleefully shaping my mountain of food to resemble the peak from Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  The last third of the buffet contains sauces.  Many many many sauces.  Get them, they are good.  They have recipes but seriously, who wants to read directions?  I needed more sauce than I took and I thought I took a lot.  It would have helped to know they were going to slap it on a grill and immediately start diluting it with water.  Seriously, I put like five or six scoops of various stuff in and it was still just barely sauced enough.  I supplemented with some spicy mustard.  So um.. then they cooked it, and we ate it.  Sure it was good.  Yes I still have leftovers.  No you can't have them.  Is the food here the best I've ever had? Hell no.  But it's pretty good for fast/cheap/healthy-ish stuff and seriously who cares? They let you play with it for like half an hour before you even sit down.  Score!

So, I was presented the option of bowling or billiards.  Having been recently humbled on the pool table I decided bowling was a safe bet.  I mean let's face it.  Bowling is one of the many things in life I suck at, but I always have a good time and even though I do it rarely I always tell myself I'm going to do it just a little more often.  When I saw her walking up with her cute little pink and black bowling shoes I knew I was in trouble.  Yes yelpers, I got smoked, spanked, clobbered.  She wiped the lane with me.  Even worse, the 9 pound balls at the lane were pink, so she was color coordinated while she was kicking my ass.  But who's kidding who here? I kinda liked it.  One difficult thing here, is that contrary to most bowling alleys I've been to, the balls are a little hard to find.  There are two racks on the North side filled with 8s and 9s.  Then there's a pile of racks over by the pool tables on the south end of the building that are a little trickier to locate.  But they can't be that hard to find, because well, I found them.  Also, if you're reading this, I just told you where they are so they should be easy to find now right?  Eager to redeem myself, we tried the basketball game.  You know the one, the simulated time free throw job.  She went first, and I watched her.  She was good, but she was using the backboard a lot.  I felt good about this.  I stepped up, Lobbed the first two and then I hit my stride.  I'd figured out my arc, I got the spin down.  Here we go, swish, swish, swish.  "Hey!" I thought to myself "I'm actually doing a good jo." But at that exact moment, my luck ran out.  Brick, Brick, Brick.  I managed to get my zen back and recovered my streak, but it was all over.  Girl brought game, and I did not.  Next, we tried the pool table that wasn't in the bar.  If you're picky, you'll be unhappy to know that the felt had a few good sized craters in it.  I'm not good enough to be picky.  I made a better showing here, but in the end my friend won again.   I ruled at Air Hockey, but something tells me she may have let me win. ;)  Either way I don't care.  I had a blast here and will definitely come by again.  The staff was friendly but busy.  I didn't try the bar but if I ever  do  I'll let you know how it is.

I remember the very first time my step dad took me to a video arcade.  I must have been about six years or seven years old.  It was the early eighties, and I was all about Defender.  Sure, I loved Missile Command.  Ultimately, I remember thinking Pac-man was "kind of dumb" but I never was much for maze games.  I wanted to press buttons, fly spaceships and shoot things.  Oh sure, I had an affair or two, Tron, Donkey Kong, the games with lots of pretty colors and such.  Nothing quite matches the magic of those days for me.  Perhaps it's the misty rose colored filter of childhood nostolgia, but arcades seemed like something different then.  Something magical.  Pitch black havens for the disenfranchised where a quarter was enough to win you fame and glory, provided you had the skills to back it up.  Fast forward some 2 decades later.  Video games have jumped the shark in a lot of ways.  With dedicated consoles, online gaming, and PC gaming,  most people don't leave the house to get their digital freak on.  A person doesn't get good at "video games' They learn the survival skills for FPS, or RTS, or MMORPGs, Sports simulations, Music simulations, fighting games.  And they do it at home, or at a LAN party.  So what's the appeal of a place like Gameworks?  Well you get to hang out with the highly annoying teenage crowd at "The Mills".  But for me it's all about the latest developments in Arcade stand alones.  They have some interesting "immersion" / VR type games, like Sky Pirates (steampunk hot air balloon aerial combat baby!), Afterburner Climax (with a servo equipped cockpit designed with some help from Boeing and Northrop Grumman, you will soon find your ego writing checks your body can't cash, and loving it!), Of course they have the old skool stuff upstairs. But hey, I got plenty of that action 20 years ago.  Or Let's Go Jungle, a dose of safari madness where you and a friend can hop into your utility vehicle and unload on mutant frogs, leeches and lots of other unpleasant things.  The 50" screen, 5.1 surround sound and kick back motors on the guns  help with the fun factor.  So when you get tired of listening to your best friend's girlfriend murdering another REM song on rock band while you hammer out a beat on your flimsy toy drum controller, when you've played with your wii so much that you can't lift the controller anymore, come down to Gameworks and try out some of the new developments in stand alone games.  The arcade is still fun, I promise.  But leave that Dio t-shirt everyone thought was so cool in the bottom of your closet.  Nobody really thought it was cool, we were just being nice.  (See Also Golf Land and Dave and Buster's.)

Driving down Apache towards Mesa where it turns into Main Street is like driving in some other country.  Due to the light rail construction, The streets are uncomfortably narrow, there are confusing signs, people drive in weird and unfathomable ways and you can never be quite sure of how you're going to get to your destination.  However, tucked away on this *ahem* quiet street, between Dobson and Alma School. Is a little pocket of goodness.  In the shadow of Filiberto's, lies a vast expanse of dark tinted glass and a sign announcing that you have reached Main Street Billiards.  The outside is appropriately dodgy enough to appeal to the seediest of characters (like myself), but the inside is well lit, clean, and of course, smoke free.  It may not be the sort of joint you'd expect to see "Fast Eddie" from The Hustler sharking in.  It's not some ritzy genteel Billiards clubhouse either.  It's basic, and clean with full size tables by the hour, reasonably straight cues and quality balls.  It's the sort of place you wouldn't feel out of place bringing your own cue to, but not the sort of place where you'd feel out of place just showing up to with a couple of friends and making fools of yourselves. Which, is one of my specialties.  The place doesn't seem to get too crowded and it looks like a great place to come  to alone and spend a few hours doing practice drills.

Yeah, it's in Scottsdale.  Yeah the menu is inconsistent.  I don't give a rat's ass. This place is the BOMB dot com.  Their shredded beef chimichanga is the best hangover cure ever.  (Props to my bro for pointing it out) and their Chile Relleno is awesome.  The atmosphere is cool and weird, it's right next to SMoCA and it's still family owned and operated.  Also, step off the salsa.  The salsa fresca in the little caraffe.. you know the one with piles of fresh tomatoes and cilantro and onions and peppers?  It rocks my world.  It's not the only salsa that makes my tongue do the Snoopy dance, but it's certainly one of them.  The service isn't always fabulous but it's never been bad.  I admit the first time I went here I wasn't overly impressed.  It turns out I ordered badly.  The trick to enjoying this place is to get one of the dishes they do well.  For me that's the shredded beef chimi, the chille relleno and cheese enchiladas in that order.

This place isn't trying to be hippie or hipster.  The place is clean.  Almost too clean, but despite that I like the place.  Their coffee is way better than anything Starbucks could aspire to but my preference is their selection of teas.  Strong, hot, loose and full of energy and flavor.  I can't say anything spectacular about their sandwiches. I've only had a breakfast sandwich there once and I was not impressed.  The muffins are good but my favorite would be the Eclairs.  Though they used to replace them every day and I'm not sure that's still the case.  It's not the best coffee I've ever had.  It's not a particularly unique coffee experience, but it's still a decent cuppa at a somewhat reasonable price and best of all it's not Starbucks.

Try the oatmeal stout.  If you can't handle beer that will put hair on your chest or the idea of a beer you can't see through makes you queasy, try the 8th Street IPA.  I haven't had anything on their menu that wasn't good, but I'm partial to the nachos and the chicken strips.  Careful the nachos come out on a fork lift.  Yes you can add beef or chicken to them, but you won't need to.  They stand up just fine without and you're not going to go hungry.  The mixed drinks are decent, but come on.  You're in a brewery. Live a little!  On a side note, the patio is smoking friendly and the water is awesome because as every good brewer knows, pure water makes awesome beer.  On the weekends this place gets over crowded.  You could go on a weeknight like a sensible person.  Or, you can simply find a person or two who is hogging an entire table to themselves and foist your company upon them.  Really, don't take no for an answer. Convince them that having you sit with them is like an unexpected gift.  And not like a crappy gift from someone who doesn't know you but feels obligated to gift you anyways.  But like a really awesome gift that you didn't even know you wanted till you opened it.  Come on now, flash that winning smile. I'll be right behind you if you need me. Honest.

Sushi 101.  It's so clever. Sitting just across from ASU main campus beckoning young hopefuls over with the promise of a survey level course in the appreciation of the best japanese cultural import since anime.  Sure, it may be a gentle introduction for sushi virgins, but there's plenty here for a seasoned veteran to sink their teeth into.  Jake has the right idea.  Go during happy hour.  I have eaten here dozens of times and the Sushi has always been good.  I'm partial to the maguro and albacore and their dragon or unagi rolls.  Because nothing says, "Kiss me baby!" like some eel in a sweet sweet sauce!.  But hey, it's your own trip. In general the drinks and sushi are fairly reasonably priced.  I've never felt out of place there and the service has always been good.  There's a wall of polaroids of people posing with their heads stuck through a Sumo wrestler cut out which is mildly amusing.  But I go here for the sweet, succulent, tender, delicious and might I add raw fish.

I walked in the front door.  The sign said, "Wookie Wednesday! Howl like a wookie for a dollar off your meal!"  The guy behind the register looked down at my black tee emblazoned with a bold cartoon logo of yesteryear and exlaimed, "What's up Thundercat.  You hungry?"  Sold.  I'm not one of Mary Jane's best boyfriends.  Oh I still think she's pretty hot.  She's just not the girl I turn to when I need some late night lovin.  So why would a fly guy who's not such a high guy be into a place with weed up in his face?  Simple.  The staff are entertaining.  The food is good and not too expensive.  I enjoy watching pictures of presidents, aliens, and your mom (I swear, go check, third polaroid from the end!)  sharing a toke and a smile while my sandwich is being situated.  Cheba is always on my list when I'm looking for something to fulfill my late, but not too late night cravings.  Even so, I still prefer take away.  It's a fun place.. for about five minutes while my sandwich is getting made.  And then I'm ready to jet.  I know I'm gonna jinx myself... but these guys have never fucked up my meal.  How cool is that?

I have never had a bad meal here.  The place is small and unassuming but it can get pretty busy during lunchtime.  I usually get one of their combination platters where you basicaly pick any three dishes on the menu and they bring it to you with a pile of fresh warm injera bread which I honestly think is my favorite part of Ethiopian food.  I usually opt for one meat and two vegetable dishes because it's a lot of food either way and I feel like I have a better chance of finishing if I go with two vegetables.  I've had the beef, the lamb, the chicken, the cabbage, the red lentils and the green beans and they are all good but my favorite is probably the lamb with cabbage and green beans.  Five stars for being the only Ethiopian food around and mighty tasty.

I used to think the stereotypical Italian grandmother who asks if you're hungry and then feeds you regardless of your answer, and then feeds you again, and then makes you a sandwich, and then brings you a canolli, and then packs something for you to take when you leave was just a myth.  Then I actually met one like that.  Oreganos reminds me of just such a grandmother.  The wait is terrible.  Really.  Bring a fucking book. Better yet, load the back of your pickup with a generator, a wide screen TV and your favorite game console.  Or better yet, bring a DVD player, your favorite movie and some lawn chairs and make everyone happy.  Cause you'll all be sitting there for a very long time.  You will finish the movie.  You might meet the love of your life, court, get engaged, become disillusioned and divorce before you get called for a table.  Deal with it.  It's pretty much worth it.  The pasta dishes are all great.  I like most of the sandwiches except for the turkey.  The pizza is good but it takes a while.  I like all of the salads.  The portions here are fucking obscene.  That's right.  That's the only way I can put it across to you so that you'll understand.  Plan to share if you don't want to be eating the leftovers you took home for a week.  If you don't believe me, you'll have plenty of time to check it out for yourself while you're waiting for your table.  Because like I said, it's going to be a while.  This is good because it gives you time to build up an enormous appetite so you can begin to contemplate actually finishing your meal.  You may even believe somehow that you're going to do it.  But don't kid yourself.  It's not possible.  The saving grace here is that the food is quite good.  Kind of a spicy take on Italian with a few curve balls thrown in just to mess with you.  Try the UFOs.  They're disgusting.  Disgustingly good.  You'll hate yourself in the morning, but you'll enjoy every delicious bite.  When the bill comes, you'll be surprised.  I paid what?  For all of that?  Don't make a big deal about it or try to get your waiter to double check it for you.  It really is that cheap.  Why do you think you and 40 other otherwise reasonable people waited for over an hour just to sit in a kitchy booth and be doted on?  What's that? You ate it all? No way. Are you sure?  Geeze dumbass, now look what you did.  How are you ever gonna have room for their signature warm cookie pizza treat thing with ice cream on top?  It's the whole reason you go.  I tried to warn you.

I won't lie, the place is sometimes dirty.  Sometimes the food sucks.  I mean I've been eating IHOP food on and off for many years, and before eating at this particular one I would have bet money that you would seriously have to try to screw it up badly.  Also, sometimes the service sucks.  They forget items, they don't remember your special requests, they may or may not bring you condiments, utensils, or even remember to wipe your table.  Why then? Why in the world would I give this place four stars?  It's simple.  On Friday and Saturday nights around 2:30, magic happens.  It's generally best to arrive early, say at 2:15 for prime seating.  Around 2:25 the trainwreck begins in earnest.  Liquored up college students shuffle in by the carload.  There will be laughter, tears, raucous and raunchy behavior.  Some will wander off to the bathroom.  Most of them will return.  Random people will start conversations with you.  Some lucky (unlucky?) strangers will hook up.  There may be dancing, singing, even removal of various items of clothing.  You may choose to raise the stakes a little by betting on your favorite contenders for likely drunken behaviors such as, that guy is going to pass out at his table.  Or that girl is coming back from the bathroom with vomit in her hair.  It's a lot like a bar or club but the music isn't as loud so it's easier to eavesdrop and / or join conversations.  Plus the real fun is in going completely sober.  Sure, I still like to tie one on now and again and I am certainly not always be a saint in public.  Every once in a while though it's fun to step outside of that and imagine how I must look to everyone else who isn't having the good time I'm having.  When I need a long hard look at myself, I find the patrons of this particular IHOP to  be  excellent mirrors. Especially at the aforementioned times.  Come on now, who doesn't enjoy a little schadenfreude with their hashbrowns?

It's not Casey's.  It's just not.  Not even close.  If you can get past that.  I think the food is better.  Guinness pours are on par with Casey's, and they have live music.  Sometimes it's even good! I like live music.  They have a back patio which is way smaller than Casey's and has no Blarney Stone.  The front area is too bright and too clean but they do have some cute stuff up on the walls.  It's a great place for drinking when it's not crowded.  St. Patricks at Rula is what's the word? Oh yes. Insane.  I have never made out with a girl in the bathrooms here.   I haven't decided if that's because Rula is too classy or I'm too classy.  Perhaps a bit of both.

I love this bar.  It's divey, dirty and delicious.  The patrons range from demure to delightful to demented.  I always meet someone new and interesting every time I go there.  All the staff are awesome and low key.  This is a good place to just chill out and relax in.  Not your typical meat market.  The Jukebox has some good tunes, the drinks are stiff and the pool is free.  They also have live music which is always a plus in my book.  And a nice little smoking room off the main bar area and I haven't been 86'd yet!

My boss is from Indiana near the Chicago side.  He sometimes gets me to eat hot dogs when we go out for lunch.  He prefers Ted's but I'd have to say this is my favorite place to sit down and devour a wiener.  Dave is a cool cat.  He's retired from the music industry, look for his gold record on the wall!  He has all kinds of funny signs up everywhere.  There are 2 TVs which are always tuned to sports channels, but not being a sports fan the appeal is lost on me.  They do always have some decent 70s rock and pop going which usually puts me in a good mood for dog consumption.  There are 2 kinds of dogs: Boston dogs and Chili dogs.    Boston dogs come dressed in mustard, onions and sweet relish.  Chili dogs come with onions, mustard and chili.  Ketchup is available over by the drinks.  Do yourself a favor and save it for the fries.  I've never seen it happen there, but I can just imagine someone putting ketchup all over their hot dog in this joint and instantly bursting into flames.  Oh well, that's what they get for not being a true believer. The dogs themselves are custom made back east according to Dave's secret recipe.  I don't give a shit what's in them, they're delicious.  The fries are decent, but nothing to write home about.  Everything else on the menu isn't worth mentioning.  It's not that it sucks, it's that the hot dogs are what makes this place.  So don't puss out.  Get a dog and enjoy it.

If I could give it half a star I would.  It's apparently $5 cover for women and $10 for men but we had these "VIP" passes that someone handed us on Mill so we got in for free. (Thank god)  I like that they play Hip Hop on Mill. Score.  I hate the door staff.  I hate the bar staff.  I dislike most of the patrons.    The layout was fine, except for the fact that it was so crowded it was nearly impossible just to get to the bathroom.  While I was there, 2 complete dumb asses decided to square off for some unknown but obviously unforgivable offense which could only be settled by loud posturing which was obviously meant to escalate into fisticuffs had the bathroom attendant who had to be in his 60s not intervened.  Within moments, bouncer guys with biceps as big as my head were swarming the men's room to take care of "the problem" all in all their little show left me annoyed and bored.  Fast forward, my lady takes a seat while I attempt to bring her a drink.  I manage to elbow my way up to the bar downstairs.  They have 3 bartenders working at this particular station and they all look terribly busy.  I pull some cash out and settle in to wait.  The guy obviously working my section thinks he's god's gift.  He's trying (but failing) to be impressive with some fancy bartending tricks he must have picked up watching that Tom Cruise abomination Cocktail.  The problem was he wasn't really any good at any of it so it was just some sort of lame delay while he tried to serve people drinks.  He noted my presence and must have realized I was out of my element.  Instead of trying to make me feel welcome, he helped everyone in the section, then everyone who came after me making another round of the section and then finally turned to me.  I had to place my order 3 times before frosted tips in a too tight shirt could hear me, and instead of giving me a normal sized cocktail he grabbed some goldfish bowl with a glass stem on it and decided to make it up to me by making me essentially 3 drinks in one glass and charging me for my trouble.  What a prince.    I made my way back to our table only to find that while I'd been gone my girl had been hit on by a random guy, a random girl and a bouncer. Classy.  The highlight of the evening was getting to meet the U of A Mascot in his street clothes.  A really nice guy, with a great attitude despite the fact that he had apparently gotten punched in the face earlier in the evening during the ASU/UofA football game.  Seriously, he was gracious about the ASU win and seemed really happy to have any Arizona teams go to Bowl games.  I wish there were more people like him out there.  We ended up leaving early because of additional drama with the patrons of this fine establishment and one of my friends.  I would be happy to never go here again.

I love you Trader Joe's.  No, you are not "my" grocery store.  I can't commit to you as my one and only baby.  It's not you, it's me.  I am tempted by the fruit of another.  Sprouts and Sunflower produce trumps you baby, but don't you worry your pretty head about it.  You've got my favorite cheese selection and you know how I am about cheese.  You know no matter how many times I stray, I'll always come back to you.  You don't need to worry about the items I buy at Safeway baby, that's different. That's just shopping.  What we have is something more than that.  I love it whenever I discover something new about you.  I can't live without your hummus or your mediterranean style yogurt.  It reminds me of crisp mornings in the Amphora Hotel in Chania harbor.  Of course the honey here will never be as magical as it was in Greece but that's not your fault dear.  I love that you know I'm not made of money.  I don't have to flash a lot of brass to impress you and that always makes me feel accepted and appreciated.  Even when you're cold, or feeling like you can't give me the things I want (because let's face it you're *always* out of stock on something I really like) I can always find something to make me feel like our time together is special and well worth the effort.  It might be another week or so until our next visit baby, but you know you're gonna be on my mind and when I hunger for something only you can provide, you know I'll be back.  I always come back.

I eat lunch here sometimes.  The chips are always a little on the burned side and need tons of salt.  I've learned from experience that this just goes better with the salsa there.  Besides, these chips are real.  Not some gigantic bag of factory chips laying on some heating tray in the back.  They killed those tortillas this morning, in boiling oil.  Seriously, the first bite not capture your imagination but you'll slowly find yourself wondering why you can't stop eating them.  They have daily specials, my favorite of which is the chicken mole which is Thursdays I believe.  I'm also a sucker for Friday's chille relleno.  If I'm there on some other less glorious day, I'll opt for the cheese enchilada plate or the Clare burro.  Try the ice tea.  It's got cinnamon in it and it doesn't taste a thing like Lipton's.

This is not my favorite venue by a long stretch of the imagination.  Don't go to a summer show.  Just don't.  It's too hot to be alive when you're just sitting around with your friends bitching about how hot it is much less when you're trying to keep an eyes on the band you came to see while throwing elbows and boots at those who seek to dethrone you from your coveted postion in the general seating area.  Now imagine yourself three rows back with Paul Bunyan reincarnated as a sweaty frat boy assaulting you with his enthusiastic howling inspired by seven dollar domestic beer in a plastic cup while simulaneously grinding his sweaty junk into your ass cheek every time the crowd surges forward.  The two high school girls in front of you turn around like you're the complete douchebag who's ruining their show instead of Paul Bunyan and his sweaty onions.  It's also a hundred and fifteen fucking degrees.  On second thought, go to a summer show.  On the bright side you will no longer fear hell.

Oh Romeo's Romeo's wherefore art though now in Gilbert?  I have loved this place for many many years.  Their pita sandwiches are fabulous.  The house salad with the creamy feta dressing is wonderful.  I'm always in the mood for one of their fabulous lemon tarts.  I've always had decent service there although on a busy night it takes a while for the food to come.  I'm glad they are doing well in Gilbert, but I miss having them down the street in Mesa.  The new space is cleaner, more cafe like with small tables and large windows.    Of the entrees that I've had there, I"m partial to Kasseri Chicken, Plaka Chicken, and the Roasted Almond Tortellini.  But hey, find your own favorites, there is  a lot to love at this place.  Portions are pretty big on everything, so come hungry.

As if this place needs more high marks.  I used to drive by the place all the time and my so at the time used to joke about Cornish Pastys being what Cornish strippers wore in non nude establishments.  All I can say is yum!  So one day, we took the plunge and stopped by after work.  It's dark but not dank.  Narrow but not crowded.  Tasty but not super fast.  Pasty may not be a good every day staple.  But it sure is tasty!  I have tried at least a half dozen menu items and none have steered me wrong but for the real "flava" I'm gonna recommend you stick with the more traditional stuff.  Otherwise you could just end up eating a calzone in disguise and seriously... who wants to eat a Cornish calzone?  The staff is nice, and friendly.  The vibe is decent and if you like meat (or veggies)  and potatoes (which may technically be a veggie but is class by itself you know) stuffed into delicous bread.  You will feel as if you have died and gone to heaven.  Do not be fooled by cheap imitations! This is not some gussied up hot pocket or some savory pop tart! This is the real deal!  After eating this you'll be ready to go into a coal mine and work for .. well no. That may be stretching the truth.  But the food is really good.  One time, I preordered from this place and got a bunch of parbaked Pasties for a Christmas Eve celebration.  They were a big hit.

I was here once.  I was lured with the promise of free beer for a hosted party sponsored by Dos Equis.  Indeed. There was free beer to be had.  It was in "the jungle room".  There was a cute waitress in a pith helmet who smiled at me and locked eyes with me in a way that says, "I'm so sorry the room I'm waiting in smells like the vomitorium.  Please tip me I'm cute and I obviously need the money. Did you see my stupid hat?"  Since the beer was free, I made sure to take care of her as best I could.  That's a hell of a way to make a living.  Because they are clever like that - they were spinning Jungle in the Jungle room.  Was it good Jungle? I don't know but I don't think so.  Being a fan of most types of electronic music I would like to think I'd know good jungle when I heard it but I'm no afficionado.  We went downstairs where the music was a little more R & B contemporary.  Which is to say, not to my taste.  They did however have gogo dancers who had obviously wrapped their feet in animal skins to fend off the biting cruel cold of  Phoenix in the summer.  In stark contrast to this, they were wearing lingerie and nothing else over the rest of their bodies, proving that the furs were doing an exceptional job in keeping them warm.  The best thing I can say about this place is  that I didn't have to pay for my drinks the one time I went, and I got to see a woman attempt to dance in five foot stilts.  Woo.

Do you know where you are? You're in the jungle baby.  You're gonna die.  But at least you won't die hungry or unhappy.  The food here is awesome.  Really delicious stuff.  I can't say enough good things about it.  Except for the fact that Cafe Istanbul is across the effin street.  And I wouldn't say I choose one exclusively over the other, but more times than not, It's Istanbul, not Constantinople.  People rave about their hummus.  Which is raveworthy.  But I'm all about the Babaganoush.  I think eggplant puree is good clean fun.  But the name sounds like slang for some big booty.  And I think I've just found a new euphemism.  Go me.

I love this place.  It's run by a Lebanese family who are just really really nice.  The hummus is awesome as is the tabouleh and labni.  My favorite though is something they call "garlic dip" which tastes like some sort of avatar of garlic came up and punched you in the mouth and then french kissed you while you were passed out.  Bring breath mints, but don't skip the garlic dip!  They have a buffet for lunch on the week days which is pretty good.  I like the gyro pita and the falafel pita.  Hell, I like just about everything I've had here.  When you're done stuffing your face, go check out the market.  They have some awesome stuff if you're into mediterranean food, some halfway decent teas, fresh olives and feta, halal meats, the whole deal.

Update: PTC's prices are now $3 per movie.  I'm going to second the five stars on this place.  Yes they're second run films.  You could pick them up on DVD, but who are you kidding? Nothing beats sitting in a theatre to see a movie for the first time.  Personally, I'm too broke to enjoy a film I am only kinda interested in during a first run.  For three bones, I can go and see a film as it was intended to be seen.  On a gigantic screen with a sticky seat and two kids making out three rows back.  I call that movie magic!  The fact that their showtimes are advertised on their website is also a big gold star.  In the lobby, they have life size statues of Laurel and Hardy, Batman, Storm Troopers and a few others.  Who doesn't love that?  I know I do.

Four words: Video Games And Beer!  I was broke that night so I was rocking a sucktastic Coor's Light in a mug the size of a small grain silo that cost me less than six bucks before tip.  The games are all run on these rechargable cards.  They have tons of video games, and of course skee ball and those silly basketball hoops.  Bring friends, get silly, and play some games.  You're not likely to meet a girl here unless she's working.  Do yourself a favor and don't bother the help unless you're just so fabulous that they cannot resist you.  In which case, you and I can be the two exceptions.  Or you could be daring and lure a girl here.  Come on, video games are almost cool now!  Ladies, if you're looking for an eligible geeky guy who's possibly socially challenged but likely trainable, this would be a prime spot.  When I was there it wasn't all that busy (Monday night) but the staff seemed friendly and eager to please.  There was a slight incident with an overly friendly guy who wanted to be our personal trainer on this game that resembles DDR but is too hard for words because of all the hopping skipping and jumping in different directions.  Anyways, I'm pretty certain by the lack of uniform that he was not working there, just trying to be friendly.  A little too friendly.  But back to the game itself.  Man it was hard!  But hey, if you don't mind looking retarded in public,  which I don't, -especially when playing video games - it's great cardio.  Play Time Crisis 4 at least once.  Tell them I made you.  Edit:  I hear what Max is saying.  There were no kids there when I was there.  I suggest you go later and drink more.

We rolled up to the state fair on a fine Sunday afternoon.  I was well hydrated and ready for an evening of debauchery involving barnyard animals, deep fried GARBAGE, shitty domestic beer in a plastic cup, and "amusement" rides.  Zed and Nickels were on the buddy system, I was their backup buddy, the third wheel on the tricycle of fun, 3-dub for short.  Is it sad that the best thing I can say about the State Fair is that with enough beer it becomes tolerable?  I discovered that I am not a big fan of deep fried sweets.  Maybe I'm just not in the right space for it, but most of the food options at the Fair looked uniformly gross.  Nickels went gaga over the bunny rabbits while I had a staring contest with a turkey.  Man turkeys are a lot of ugly to pack into one bird.  I'm not sure I can continue to eat something that ugly, because if you are what you eat, well let's just say it's not going to be pretty and leave it at that.  You would think the funhouse type attractions would be more fun with a few beers but honestly they just weren't. I wanted them to be, but there was nothing scary or really all that interesting about them.  The sky rail thing was a little fun altough I felt a little silly sitting up there without skis on and you can imagine my disappointment when the ride did not end at the top of a mountain.  We successfully avoided a Doughtry concert, which made me happy, but there was some sort of frightening pre-teen dance troup trainwreck that we ended up in front of at some point.  We tried to make light of it.  I tried to remember the hilarity of Donnie Darko's little sister's dance troup.  I made a half hearted attempt at telling Zed that sometimes I doubt his commitment to Sparklemotion but it was no use.  Nickels brought up the fact that somewhere in the audience there was probably a pedophile or two taking in the show and it was all down hill from there.  We walked away skeeved out at a society that thinks it's cute to paint up 11 year olds like $10 whores, throw them in sparkly boyshorts, teach them to shake their asses in some semblance of coordinated effort and call it entertainment.

This is a chain restaurant, but they are fanatical about the quality of their food and service.  It's a little pricey at around $20-$25 a plate for a dinner entree but the food is high quality.  Let's get our priorities in order:  In terms of drinks, I had a vodka tonic (Well vodka there is Smirnoff but they also carry Ketel One) and a Watermelon Margarita.  The vodka tonic was about what you'd expect.  A decent neutral drink with a splash of citrus.  The Watermelon Margarita was a little sweet for my taste but it was definitely an interesting experience and certainly strong enough and big enough.  It's a $9 drink but it comes with a sidecar caraffe that will completely refill the Margarita glass and then some so it's really like 2 margaritas for under five bucks each.  Now that that's out of the way let's discuss dessert:  I had a bite of the cheesecake which was tasty, but not award winning.      Entrees: I tried the NY strip and a lobster tail, both of which were well prepared though I'm not a huge fan of their spice rub.  It's not bad mind you, I just prefer my steaks either naked or marinated.  The good news is their steaks are never frozen and the quality of the cuts I saw looked pretty high (mine was good).  The lobster tail was good.  I'd say comparable to Red Lobster which is probably about all you can expect for a chain restaurant in the desert.  Besides, I like Red Lobster so that's not intended to be a slight, it's just not the same as living in port towns and having fresh local seafood available which is an entirely different thing.  The house garden salad was nothing to write home about, but it wasn't disgusting either.  They rounded up the usual suspects (Iceberg, Carrots, an onion ring, a couple of cucumbers and some cherry tomatoes) and held them for questioning in an average sized bowl.  it was about what you'd expect for a dinner salad at a steak place.  The bread was fresh and delicious.  I liked the taste better than that brown stuff they serve at Outback.  My baked potato was pretty much what you'd expect from a baked potato. Split down the middle with butter in it.  It was good, but I couldn't finish it as I had too many other competing morsels to contend with.  All in all the food was good and my only complaint was that I ate too much.  I would definitely go again.

When it comes to Pet-centric megamarts here in the valley, you have two choices that I know of, PetSmart and Pet Co.  For my money, I tend to find better deals at PetSmart and they carry a better selection of the oddball stuff that I tend to care most about.    When I was moving into my new place, I was concerned about both the new furniture and the light colored carpet.  I have 2 longhair cats who shed like it's going out of style.  One is black with a reddish undercoat, the other is soft tortie / grey tabbie.  Between the two, we have enough colors to show up badly on any type of furniture or carpet you can imagine.  Employing my internet research superpowers, I discovered the Furminator, which is hands down the BEST shedding tool I have ever seen.  I was able to pick one up at my local Petsmart, along with a bottle of Simple Solution Allergy formula cat cleaner.  And it turns out they even stock the softclaws brand kitty nail caps that I have to keep on my Maine Coone to prevent him from destroying every fabric surface in existence.  Go Team PetSmart!

'It's Mexican food captain, but *not* as we know it.  I was introduced to this place many years ago and I keep coming back because the food is good and I've never found another place quite like it.  The flavors are a little different than what I'm used to.  This is New Mexican food as in that state next door, not New as in nouveau or anything pretentious like that.  The speicals are usually decent but I'm a sucker for my old standbys.  The spooning rellenos plate and the Sante Fe which is a sort of mix and match  create our own which I always get with a chile relleno, a cheese enchilada and either a beef taco or a beef tamale.  Mmm!  They have two sorts of sauces that get draped over stuff, red and green.  Green is spicy. Red is hot.  If you don't like hot, don't say I didn't warn you.  I always order it on the side.  It feels a little bit prissy but that way I don't have to deal with too much sauce if I don't feel like it.  And hell, I'm the one who has to eat it and pay for it, so I want it how I want it.  I'm surprised at the reviews for bad service as I've always had good service there.  I must just be so charming that people go out of their way to be nice to me.  Yeah that's it! So if you go, remember to be charming, and bring your Visa card.. because they .. oh wait, they do? Nevermind.
