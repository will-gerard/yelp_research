I had the Acapulco gold blunt sandwich and it was great.  The bread was soft and flaky and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The staff was totally cool with me being high and we all laughed.  The black tea is amazing as well!

This place was amazing, the food was fresh and cooked to perfection. I had the chicken fried steak and it was big enough to take another meal home in leftovers.  The service was great, always filled up our glasses and didn't leave the dirty plates on the table for more than a minute.  This place is Canyon State Beard Club approved!

This place was amazing 10 years ago and it still is amazing today! Glad I accidentally came into this little hole in the wall joint twice in my life. I made my own burger which was worth the extra cost of toppings because when you order bacon, you get some BACON! Make sure to check this place out.

Went here for my grandmothers birthday and was surprisingly disappointed! The staff seemed good, the atmosphere was fun. But the food was bland, overpriced and just sad. Only thing that tasted good was the free corn bread and Savory chicken doughnuts, but those are just appetizers? My $23 steak looked so small and sad. I've had better steaks for a way less price. Plus no sides unless you want to pay for them? Got the $7 fries that were soggy and no seasoning on anything. You would think with such a small menu they would have it down and be pros at cooking it?  Save your hard earned money and take your special someone to a place that is worth it.

This place has remodeled but don't let that fool you,  same bad food. My chicken strips were fried like catfish?!?! So weird? I couldn't taste any alcohol in my drink and the it took over 10 minutes to get me.

This is my favorite Gyro place in town, always fresh food, the staff is always nice. I just eat the chicken gyro,  they recommend the chicken kabob over the shredded chicken, witch i thought was very cool of them for the heads up. I love this place and will always come back.

I have been coming here over 7 years and it never disappoints.  The staff is amazing and food is always fresh. The prices are about the same as other places but the happy hour is the time to come. The saving are amazing during happy hour and if i have ever had a problem, they go above and beyond to fix it. I love how some of the rolls have a local theme, nice touch!

This place has consistently bad food, the service is sloppy and seems like they dont care at all. Its been this way for years and I only eat here once a year. Everytime its a huge disappointment and waist of money.

I have been here twice in the last year and each time I have been disappointed. I went there with three other people to scout it out for a November event I throw in downtown mesa. I like to try places out so when people come from out of town I can tell them where to eat.   When we walked in we were not greated, the place was dead and two people standing at the bar just looked at us without saying a word. Awkward!  The waiter wasn't at all friendly and kind of had a "why are you bothering me?" kind of vibe about him. Had the same experience with the same guy the first time i eat there.   The food wasn't good at all, i couldn't finish it, the bread tasted like freezer burn on the pizza witch i didnt  want to complain about because they would of just made another one that most likely would of tasted the same. Had some garlic bread that tasted the same way? But also tasted like they tried to cover it up with a lot of garlic.   The only reason why i gave this place two stars is because the waiter was really good at refilling the drinks.   Other then that this place has a very unwelcoming vibe  and maybe it was just us? I dont know? But im not bringing 50 people here in November to have to deal with the samething.

I normally never give a one star but my experience here last Friday night has left me not wanting to ever go to this location again. The last 2 times has been horrible.  I brought an out of town friends here. My wife  ordered a pasty because she liked the sauce that it came with, she specifically asked the waitress about the sauce that came with the pasty, and the waitress said it was their most popular sauce.  After the pasty's came to the table, I noticed how small they where compared to their tempe location, for almost $10 I normally can  make two meals out of one pasty. Not at the mesa location though, it was also like this last time I went and I thought it was just a one time thing. I was wrong.   Back to the sauce, last time they gave her a half a cup of sauce so she had to ask for more, but they were out so had to make more, which they did, but by the time it got to the table the pasty was cold.   This time, they replaced the sauce with a gravy, and when my wife asked for the other kind they said they were out. They didnt offer to make any more and just gave her a different sauce. I would think if thats the most popular sauce and with over 2 hours left before close they would make some more? Also why didnt the waitress tell her before bringing the food to the table? She would have gotten a different pasty if she knew about the sauce.  Our desert apple pie pasty was cold, with a huge chuck of cold caramel in the middle.   All around a bad experience and I'll never go to this location ever again. I'll be going to the tempe one, but still hesitant after this visit.

This place never disappoints, the food taste fresh, and hot, this is by far my favorite Mexican food place in town and im a native to Arizona.  The California surfin burrito is my favorite.  The horchata is the best in town. Try the cinnamon chips!

The food and prices are amazing! The service was great, we had a group staying in the hotel next door and had about 30 person party roll in for brunch. They made everyone feel comfortable and welcomed. It didn't take long for the food to come out and I can't wait to eat here again.  This place is Canyon State Beard Club approved!

The food was amazing and the the service was great as well. I wish i the waitress checked on us during the meal, but thats because i wanted to tell her how good the food was. Thanks for great food.

I really liked this place the first time I ate here but the second time eating here will be my last.  The prices jumped up overnight it seemed.  The portion sizes were cut back so it didn't feel like I got my money's worth.  The staff seemed, poorly trained, we had a waiter try to take our drink orders after someone already took our drink orders, then when the drinks came out only two showed up and the other two people who ordered drinks waited tell their food came out to get the drinks. The staff just seemed like no one knew where to go or what to do. I was embarrassed after talking this place up to my out of towners . I hope this place doesn't last long and something better moves in soon.  They would be doing downtown a favor if they did.

This place is making downtown mesa look bad! First time I ate here it was good and the prices were fair. Two months later the prices have been jacked up and the portions size went down, not sure how that works? Maybe they got a new chef since I ate there last? The staff seemed like they didn't know what they were doing or who they were serving. The Manger of this place needs to be replaced or just put a better restaurant on that corner.  Let's hope they don't delete this Honest review!

This place isn't good for groups even if they say they can. We brought a group in with two months notice and they weren't ready for us at all. Made us look bad and made our group mad and hungry. The employees where rude and untrained and the food had no flavor. All in all, I wouldn't go back here ever!

I have been here a few times and just always disappointed. The meat has no flavor, tzatziki sauce is bland and the frys are always soggy, even when I get them in the shop. There are better places within a stone throw, I'll be going to other places.
