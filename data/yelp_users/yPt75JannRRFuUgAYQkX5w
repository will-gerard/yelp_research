Rudest store owner ever. First thing he said when we went in was, "anything you break you buy". That's probably the only way you can sell anything.  Don't go here. Do business with local stores who like the people in your community.

Fantastic! The facilities & staff are all wonderful.  It was refreshiing to know that our dogs were safe and sound in a clean environment. They came home looking better than ever before! We have only had 2 groomers in 9 years, but Puff and Fluff will be our last!  We are customers for life!

Great donuts! Don't see what you want? No problem, they will make it for you on the spot! You won't get a fresher donut than that!

The food is absolutely amazing here.  Love the atmosphere and the drinks are the best! Try the Dr. Funk or Painkiller. Also one of my favorites for Sunday brunch, try the Hangover Hash, delicious!

Excellent Mexican food. Very friendly too!  Tuesdays 99 cent tacos rolled or folded, beef or chicken. It's a steal!

Have been coming here for years with coworkers, asked for a cup for water with my meal & they said I have to pay for it!  We ordered 3 meals and you can't give us a cup for water?? Well we will never be back here again. Your 50 cent charge just cost you hundreds of dollars.

Always good, don't just stick to burgers. The chicken sandwich and turkey sloppy joe are fantastic!

Great place for Greek food. Food is fresh and tastes great! You can't go wrong here, but the Gyro special is a fantastic deal!

I did a Zumba class with Jennifer Ragan and I was more than pleased. She makes it easy to quickly learn the movies and start burning those calories!  She made it so fun I forgot I was working out. I'll definitely be back for more.  The Studio is also fantastic and everyone is so nice and friendly.

I periodically get massages at places for a sore shoulder and it feels good for about a day.  My massage by Jon at BodySmart for the same reason had entirely different results!  I not only felt better for a day, but several days, and now my shoulder is much better after 1 massage.  Instead of just treating the problem Jon is solving it and I should be pain free shortly.  Great communication before, during, afterwards helps the process.    My wife also gets regular treatments from Jon and has had fantastic results also.  Jon and BodySmart Massage aren't just life changers, they're life improvers!

Fun place to hang out at.  Margaritas are amazing, especially the seasonal ones. Not real authentic Mexican food so stick to the tacos, they are good.

Incredible, authentic Mexican food.  They have breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The food is incredible, but make sure you don't pass up the desserts.  They have bakery items and gelato & paletas!    The aqua frescos are excellent as well. You won't be disappointed here.

Great place. Perfect for lunch or dinner or just grabbing a drink. Great sports bar feel, but family friendly.

Wow!  Pizza was great and beer was cold.  Definitely coming back to take advantage of all of the games on their big screen TVs. Happy hour pricing is amazing and great menu.
