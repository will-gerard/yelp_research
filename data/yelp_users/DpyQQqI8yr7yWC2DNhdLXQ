Since 2000 I have been making trips to this joint.  They haven't  changed much except for the decor.    The staff is busy and strait to the point, because we have some serious BBQ going on back here.  Which is totally cool with me as long as I get my pulled pork with joes famous BBQ sauce were all good.  Located in historic downtown Gilbert across the street from hale theater.  I'm not sure if they still have it but if you show up on your b-day your meal is on the house.  When you walk up in line with that wonderful aroma coursing thru the air, your beverages await you in two horse troughs and up on the wall.  The menu is very simple just pick based on your desire for awesomeness to overfill your stomach.   My choices for every visit would have to be the pulled pork sandwich.  My favorite side would have to be the cheezy potatoes then the ranch beans.  I've try'd both BBQ sauces but I always lean a bit more towards something sweet like joes famous sauce.  This establishment has never let my stomach down and in another 16 years I don't think it will.  Please make a visit in if your ever around  the Gilbert area of Phoenix az you won't be disappointed non the least.

Internet review experience only I never went here.  I purchased a gift card on here for a family member.  Based on the reviews and talking to friends and family this place is nice.  I just wanted to do something nice for their birthday.  I was told they had a grand reopen because they moved into different buildings.  The website is nice and easy to use.  I was able to locate prices for services to help me find the right gift card.  I really like business that participate in PayPal.  I live in another state so I was able to have the gift card ship to them.  This was a good experience for me.  It's also always good to have a good website for your business for certain circumstances like this one.  If I were really into the spa treatment experience I would defiantly check this place out.

This place is so friendly and FAST!  I always get the lamb gyro and maybe even chicken and they are both very tasty good.  I have had three friends try and loved the idea of gyro's afterwards.  The French fries that come with a combo are also really good.  Kinda difficult to find but just call they are more than happy to help.

Fantastic food with a very elegant atmosphere.  Nicely located in the santan village area near the best buy and total wine and more.    The staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  We probably had three different visits from restaurant staff.  The wait was minimal on a weekday, walk in and walk out basically.  Parking was very simple no driving around and parking in another lot.  Food came out fairly fast compared to most but it was a weekday at night.  It was just the two of us but I did see a table of eight that sat down the same time we did and finished when we did.  We also ordered the same thing no appetizer or special drink orders and possibly managed to get out of there under $75.  We both had the rib-eye which was absolutely amazing!  The meat was very tender and marinated in a sweet teriyaki sauce.  Then toped off with small onion strings and grilled pineapple.  The pineapple was so juicy and full of flavor from sitting and fusing with the rib-eye.  Then it came with some very good mashed potatoes and green beans.  We totally forget to order the pot stickers, were told very good.  This is a must while visiting Phoenix, will defiantly try to go here next time.

Me and my wife still talk about this place.  The way they cook there chicken is perfect and the crab puff is decent.  We like to make it easy and just share orange chicken but when I get a chance I order lemon chicken.

This visit was my first to 'LL's can't say I want to return anytime soon.  The service was fair and the food was about the same.  This location was situated in the wild horse pass casino and hotel which was my first time visiting.  My friends took me and my brother here while my visit back home.  Can't say I enjoyed the restaurant very much and that maybe just because the waitress may have had a bad day or weekend but it also seemed qto be bad attitudes around the entire staff...  I have personally always liked eating at casino's, I know super strange but this visit was not ideal and not bad just no fire unfortunately for LL's.  I ordered the evil jungle princess beef, when I noticed it on the menu I just couldn't resist.  I also order some soup which was nothing to rave about.  When my meal arrived the presentation for a $16 dollar plate was very poor.  I have payed for meals under $10 and gotten $30 presentations before but this was bad.  First bite was interesting and towards the middle to the end I just had enough.  I was hoping for more of what was described in the menu detail but the cook failed to sell me on it.  In the end LL's received stars based on performance and taste and I may be slightly more harsh on upper scale places but that's for a reason $.  My return to 'LL's may possibly happen again some day but not soon.

Our family has been going to Matta's since the early 90's and I can say they have changed a little since they closed the original location.  It's too bad that place had memory's and stories.  My sister loves this place and has carried three children into Matta's and the waitress from the original location got to see two of them grow.  So it's not only great food and fun but the staff and name are honest and true.  My favorites include Roberts tacos, chili relleno, and the hot sauce!
