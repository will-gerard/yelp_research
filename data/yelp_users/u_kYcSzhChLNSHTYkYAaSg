These guys do a great job and test my pool water all the time. They are also really good at finding out why my Hayward has stopped working.   I also paid them to do an acid wash on my pool and it turned out great. They have also come out to my house on a few occasions to fix my pool filter.

We recently hired O'Neal Printing to take care of a custom large-format project. We needed a life-size vehicle printed on gaterboard and delivered to a tradeshow out of town, in 3 days. They not only assisted us with the artwork, but also printed, and coordinated all of the complex shipping needs. I have to hand it to these guys, they do excellent work. Thanks!

I purchased a bicycle here a few years ago, and have brought it and my wife's bicycle in for tire changes during that time. I had found the service to be excellent, until a recent experience. Now, I'm going to find a different bicycle shop.  In late September, I had tubes replaced on my bicycle and brought them home and let them sit for around 6 weeks (didn't ride at all). Then, in November I went to go ride and found that both tubes were totally flat, and couldn't be inflated. So, I took the bike over to Performance Bicycle and asked them to replace the tires as I perceived it as faulty workmanship or faulty product.    I didn't blame them for it, I just wanted the tubes replaced so I could go for a bike ride. Everybody makes mistakes.  The repair guy's initial diagnosis was that I had overinflated the tires, causing them to burst. This was not the case, and later on they found tube puncture holes. The puncture holes I believe were from some debris or a sticker that was in the tire, and had not been cleaned by Performance Bicycle.  I am satisfied that Performance Bicycle did the repair for free, however here is where it all broke down:  a) They couldn't issue a replacement on the spot, and told me a manager would have to approve it, and being a Saturday they didn't have one in the store, what about their satisfaction guarantee? What kind of store doesn't give employees the ability to issue a simple $10 repair for free? Why must I wait for a manager? Why could a manager not be called (I asked).  b) A manager never called me, and I had to call them. It took them 10 minutes to find my bicycle, and another few minutes to determine what to do.   c) They told me to come in on Friday, and that they'd have it all taken care of, and there would be no charge. But, when I came into the store on Saturday, they still hadn't worked on the bicycle, and told me it would be another 30 minutes. Why did it take a whole week to fix two flat tires?  d) They asked me if I would pay for the new tubes, considering they were puncture holes, and I insisted that I would not because I hadn't ridden them. They told me that part of the service of repairing a flat tire is to inspect the tire for objects (I suspect they didn't). They asked me twice to pay for the new tubes. I don't think they get the fact that this was their fault.  e) Upon replacement, they told me the new tubes were without warranty. Why? I paid for the original ones, just because you had to replace them because of your fault why should the replacement have no warranty?  f) Upon leaving the store with my free replacement tires, I noticed that one of the tires was making a sound and that it was leaking air. I took it back in the store and they had to remove the tire and tube and put a third tube into it. This took another 20 minutes. It was terribly funny, and perhaps proves my point.  My biggest gripe: the attitude. They didn't trust me, a customer they had done business with for a few years, that I hadn't ridden on the bicycle since they had done the repair. They also insinuated that it was my fault, and didn't consider for a moment that they might have caused the flat by failing to inspect the tire for objects. They also failed to diagnose it the first time, telling me I had overinflated the tubes (which I didn't do).  Second biggest gripe: can't do anything without manager approval, and the manager isn't always there. They left me hanging.  Update: November 28 (a few days later): The rear tire is completely flat the next morning. They couldn't fix it in 3 tries.

By far my favorite Panang Curry dish in all of Arizona. It is awesome! My wife loves the Pad Thai as well.

Cashier accused me of stealing after I had paid for my items. Enough said.

If I could give Press Coffee six stars, I would. They are consistently good, and roast and serve amazing coffee. They make a true classic cappuccino, pour with excellent latte art, and have experienced barista's on staff. Highly recommended.

Recently upgraded to the new iPhone, and my sales rep (Bill) covertly added Vz Navigator ($4.99 monthly) and Protection - iPhone ($10 monthly) without even mentioning these, or asking if I wanted them. I only discovered them later while reviewing my bill. I'm unsatisfied with my experience. Next time, I'll go to one of the kiosks at the mall.
