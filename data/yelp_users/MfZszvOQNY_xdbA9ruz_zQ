My husband and I ate lunch here a couple of weeks ago...I literally think about the chicken fried steak everyday.  First of all, it's HUGE...we're talking hanging off the plate huge.  Second of all, the mashed and gravy--'nuff said!  Third of all, the pecan pie.  My husband ordered it (as much as I wanted to try the peach cobbler, I felt like Violet Beauregarde from Willy Wonka when she ate the gum)...I took one bite (delicious, I might add), and he literally knocked the spoon out of my hand.  I thought he was going to lick the plate clean.  Anyone that gave this place bad reviews obviously is missing some taste buds, and probably thinks the food at TGIFridays is good...I wouldn't take their reviews seriously.  I love this place...not only is the food delicious, but it has a great atmosphere!  Old hats, brochures, business cards, license plates, etc. decorate the place.  Great food, great atmosphere!

The food was awful, but the service was fantastic!  The service is the only reason it's getting 2 stars.  My husband had one of the burgers and he said that it taste like a frozen burger patty.  I had the Kobb salad...It just wasn't good.  We did have the nacho app...Half the cheese wasn't melted, and if you wanted any beans or meat on it, it was extra.  Over all the nachos weren't bad--only because they were part of the half price apps during happy hour.  It was pretty crowded--I literally think my pony tail was touching the girls pony behind me, and there were a lot of kids.  I would say, don't wast your time/money here.

Huge selection and the food was fresh!  Great service!  Was definitely cleaner than some of the other Chinese buffets I've been to.  They also have made to order sushi (I didn't ry it), but that's an added plus!  All that for $8.99!

It was ok...Nothing special.  I ordered an italian sub, and it was served on a bun/roll...not the Italian bread that I'm used to.  I should have just gone to Jimmy Johns.

I wanted to like this place...really, I did!  After reading reviews and looking at pictures, I had to try it.  The chips and salsa--very good!  The carne asada--not good.  At all.  It was very salty and kind of gross.  Instead of serving it like a steak (like I'm used to), it was cut up for me...I felt like I was 5 years old and not allowed to touch a knife.  I feel bad because our server was so nice!  I wish I could give 5 stars for the server alone, but unfortunately I went there for carne asada, not the waitress!

What's not to like about ice cream (unless you have a lactose allergy, of course!).  The inside is adorable and it offers a ton of ice cream options, so there's something for everyone.  Great staff here as well...our server was fabulous!  To the reviewers complaining about cleanliness...I have a bit of OCD--especially at restaurants.  Was the bathroom the cleanest/nicest I've ever used?  No--I would say more "old" than "dirty", but at least it worked and had soap (ever been to a restaurant where there's no soap in the bathroom...how gross.).  I didn't notice any crumbs on the floor or on seat cushions...In my opinion though, I'd rather have crumbs on the floor than have someone sweeping or vacuuming next to me while I'm trying to eat.

Went today for the first time. The quesadillas were the best I've ever had. My husband had the Cuban sandwich, which of course I tried...it was equally delicious! The atmosphere made me feel like I was back in the Bahamas. And not to forget the staff. We sat at the bar, and the bartenders were wonderful and so nice!

The Capital Grille...I've eaten at the ones in Chicago and Las Vegas, but there was just something about this one that I didn't care for.  Seems like their selection has gone down possibly?  I'm definitely a steak eater and have no problem spending that much money (they seem to be pricier that I remember--and they are a chain, none the less) on one, but that particular night I didn't really have a taste for a steak...or chicken or fish...Unfortunately those were the only options beside salad.  Would I eat there again?  Probably not.  There are so many other restaurant options in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I would suggest going elsewhere--unless you enjoy ordering a sub par steak from a small menu.

I would like to start out by saying that I haven't eaten a full meal here...Only a croissant and iced latte.  The croissant was good!  The latte on the other hand was by far, the best I've ever had.  If you want a change from Starbucks, definitely check them out!

Had dinner there last night. The salsa they serve was just ok--it was very tomato-y, and I'm not a tomato person. We ordered the queso for an app and it was yummy! The only problem is, if you let it sit, it will harden (yes, we left a wee bit in the bottom of the bowl.  My husband and I both had the carne asada, and it was pretty effn good! I like that they weren't stingy with their cheese! The staff there is awesome! We were asked to change tables because the dj was coming in, and that's where he sets up. It was really no big deal-especially since we just ordered. They were so nice that they comp'd 2 margaritas which were $10 each. I definitely recommend this place!

If you are looking for a place to do tequila shots, this is not the place, as they are stingy with their booze...That was 100% sarcasm.  The Patron shots are LITERALLY 3 shots in one.  Also just recently noticed that they have a Nintendo Wii set up--drunken bowling anyone?

I'm Greek, so I wasn't so sure about a Greek chain...Until I had the Greek fries.  If loving them is wrong, I don't want to be right.  The Greek salad and Avgolemono soup are also very good!  Great staff and I haven't been there yet where it's been overly crowded.  Overall, it's good food at good prices.  Opa!

Oh.My.God.  I consider cakes (regular, cup, pan) to be their own food group, and it is my favorite.  I have an addiction.  I happened to drive past OllieCake today and saw their sign outside: "We Won Cupcake Wars".  Again, I have an addiction.  I had to stop--cupcakes are my drug of choice..  The inside is cute and tiny.  I managed to control myself and only get 4 (and a cookie).  So far I've only had the vanilla (as I've said in my review for Sprinkles--how hard is it to screw up a vanilla), and it was UH-MAZING.  The frosting wasn't too sweet and the cake was perfectly moist, and they are cheaper than the "other" cupcake shop.  You should just go there right now.

The BEST cupcakes I've ever had period.  Perfectly moist, perfectly sweet.  Plus they are organic!  I picked up some organic cupcakes from Whole Foods over the weekend (just because I was there), and they were awful...The lesson?  Organic cupcakes can be delicious if you get them here.I think I would do anything for their Brown Velvet cupcake--not that the other flavors aren't good, that just happens to be my favorite.  Go here NOW and get yourself some!!!

Went for lunch and had the pizza/caesar salad combo.  I went with the sausage/pepperoni pizza and I must say, it wasn't bad!  I know that they pre make the pizzas and re-heat them for you so I can only imagine the pizza being better when ordering a fresh one (which I'm looking forward to!).  The caesar was very good!  Another bonus, got 10% off for being a local employee!  And to the people that think that they're pricey must be used to ordering from the $1 menu from McDonalds or going to Taco Bell.  The combo I got was under $6 and I was full!  I think someone else posted that they only offer dine in on the weekends?  I was there during the week and the hostess asked us which we wanted--sit down or counter service...maybe they have changed it since that review.  I definitely look forward to trying them out again!  Finally, a Chicagoan found great pizza in Arizona!

I had to make Sprinkles one of my first stops when I arrived in AZ. The first time I tried to go, it was just after (we're talking like 5 min) closing, an the doors were locked. I'm not the only person that walked up to the door either. Whatever though...businesses have hours, I get that. The second time I went I ordered a 4 pack: vanilla, pumpkin, black and white, and strawberry. I started with the pumpkin--it was ok/nothing special second was the strawberry--still makes my mouth water; in fact, while I'm typing this, I'm wondering how late they are open so I can go get one. Third was the black and white--like the pumpkin, it was just ok. Last was the vanilla--it was very good (I don't know how hard it is to screw up a vanilla cupcake though). Something I do want to point out though is that the frosting is VERY sweet. I love sweet, but it was almost too much. That was part of the reason I gave it 4 stars. The other reason are the prices. I want to say it was around $18 for 4 regular size cupcakes and a bottle of "sprinkles" water. If they were actually out if this world, I wouldn't complain about the price...but for 1 out of 4?! I definitely recommend trying the strawberry though. Mmm...

I stopped in in the afternoon (maybe around 4?) and the selection was very slim, so I ended up going with the 2 basics--vanilla, and the tuxedo (chocolate with vanilla frosting).  My husband had the vanilla and said it was ok.  I had the tuxedo...honestly, it tasted like it was made from a cheap boxed cake mix--Not that the boxed mixes taste bad, but for $3.50 each, I want better than box.  My husband didn't mention the moistness of the vanilla one, but the tuxedo one was way too moist--like falling apart while I was trying to eat it.  I ended up throwing half of it away because it was getting too messy and just wasn't that good.  My suggestion, drive a few more minutes down Scottsdale Rd. and go to Sprinkles.

OOOMMMGGG...I am obsessed with Forefathers.  I think I could literally eat there every day.  They do have a bunch of sandwich options, although I've stuck with the Original "with wiz".  They have a small fridge with peppers and fry sauce--must try the fry sauce.  The staff there is so nice and it's always clean.  The only bad thing about going during lunch is that it is on the small side so seating can sometimes be a problem.  They do have outdoor seating though.

Their lox cream cheese is to die for! I could literally eat it with a spoon. Their bagels are good as well. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they seem a little pricey for the dozen bagel/cream cheese bundle.

I wish I could give this place zero stars.  I had the NY steak and cheese on  ciabatta and I'm pretty sure that dog food would have tasted better.  It honestly tasted like old meat.  You couldn't even taste the cheese.  Eww...just thinking about it is making me nauseous.

I wish I could give Salon D'Shayn and D'Lisa 10 stars!  I recently relocated to the Scottsdale area, and was desperate to find somewhere to get my wax on...especially seeing the same girl in Chicago for years.  Let me tell you, Obviously when you think of getting a wax, you don't think of it as being a pleasant, painless experience.  This time it was.  D'Lisa is the bomb and I will continue to see her every 5 weeks until she retires!

Loves me some Trader Joe's...Only disappointment I have is their tortellini.  Thank god I bought it for myself and not to make for company...more than half of it was garbage.  Oh well...everything else here is great--including the staff!

Wedge salad is delish! Love the fact that it's organic, as well as the fact that the pizza dough is gluten-free...sure beats having my husband sneeze for an hour, after eating "regular" pizza. I will say, the pizza is pretty good...and this is coming from a girl from Chicago!

Love this place!  My husband and I have been looking for a place where the food is good and has a great atmosphere, and we definitely found it here!  We were headed for Tomaso's, but one of the Tommy V's regulars saw us checking out the menu and insisted that we check it out instead...We are so glad we did!  Everyone there (the "regulars" and staff) are SO nice.  Since they are part of Tomaso's, you are able to order off of their menu as well...plus they will work with you if there's something you'd like that isn't on the menu (so I've been told).  We've only been there twice, but everything we've had has been wonderful!  They have a great happy hour too.  I'm looking forward to our next dinner there!  Great food and great company...nothing beats it!

If you want a huge, delicious sandwich, this is the place to go.  They offer a ton of options.  I opted for the Liverwurst and it was delish!  Potato pancakes?  Umm, yes please!  Keep in mind that this is a true deli...you have to wait in line.  I haven't been there during a lunch or dinner rush, but they actually have "approximate wait time" signs up, so I'm guessing they get pretty busy!  Definitely check this place out!

I was only at the casino, but it was very nice!  Probably the cleanest casino I've ever been to!  The staff was very nice!
