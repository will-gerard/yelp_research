Been coming here for years. It's my favorite Mexican restaurant and I always visit when I come to Phoenix from Denver. Sadly, the impetus of my review today is a complaint. Before we were able to order another patron was checking on the status of their order. Angel, the woman at the counter assured her it would be ready in five minutes and that it was delayed "because you had a big order." We then watched Angel print the patrons ticket, give it to the kitchen and asked for it to be rushed.   Sometimes things fall through the cracks but the right thing to do here is to admit the mistake... Not flat out lie. I really hate liars.

I live in Denver. Phoenix was my childhood home. When I go to Jack in Denver, it's a different franchisee and it's obvious. The Jack's in Denver get my order right 25% of the time. This place gets it spot on every time. Thanks for being consistent. Never thought I'd give a 5 star review for fast food but you and your franchisee deserve to know I appreciate it.

I just had a couple adult beverages before my flight today and paid. I honestly didn't leave a 20% tip, mainly because $30 for two drinks always pains me before a flight. Even though I only tipped about 10% the bartender figured out which flight I was on because I neglected to put my credit card away. When I boarded, the gate agent gave me my credit card. I could not have been happier and unexpectedly surprised. I wanted to go give him an extra tip but unfortunately this review was the best I could do since I was already boarding.

Waited 30 minutes at a table after ordering 6 drinks and opted to leave.  Adding more words because yelp won't let me post this story without more words but there's nothing more I need to stay
