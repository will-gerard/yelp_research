Well let's start with the front desk staff are total dolls. However, it just goes down from there. I arrived to the table to see the dirty silverware that was awaiting me. To my surprise the server didn't apologize, so to prevent getting more dirty utensils I went to the front to get plastic ware. When I ordered my food I expressed that I had food allergies. And made it VERY clear that they must avoid acid and potassium. I also ordered my fish and green beans boiled and steamed. When my food arrived, you guessed it, there was broccoli and saut√©ed green beans in butter and lemon. The server was no where to be found so I had to seek out the manager to get the problem corrected. Needless to say I will never be back and I'd advise you to avoid this place like the plague.
