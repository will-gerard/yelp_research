I went here for breakfast with my wife in December 2009  First off, the waiter we had was friendly and accomodating, and the menu has all the standard fare for a breakfast restaurant.   But, some of the other wait staff should have been fired for their unprofessional loud gossiping just 5 feet from the nearest customers table.  Decor- very country and kitch.  Price - If you don't get the specials then the menu gets pricey quite fast.  Food Quality -  the quality of the ingredients they use is noticeably lower than typical restaurant quality fare. The only flavor in the sausage was pepper, the eggs are so so and coffee gave me heart burn. The other thing to add is that the water they bring to the table is not reverse osmosis treated water like in most restaurants, it is the standard foul tap water of the neighborhood.  All in all, I won't come back here.  Right after leaving, we went to AJ's next door where they were cooking their weekend omelettes with Gourmet coffee. Next time we'll just go to AJ's instead and be happier.  But at least the company I had that day was awesome!

I was so excited about going here because I'd bought a groupon for $20 of sugary indulgences and I was going to make to most of it!  However...the goodies just weren't good enough to make me want to waste the calories and finish even a single treat I'd bought. So, here's a run down. Petit Fours - Massive, not petit at all and flavorless Napoleons - The vanilla cream in it simply tasted congealed and didn't have much vanilla in it. Puff Pastry was flavorless. Mini Eclairs - Frosting was good and chocolatey, the filling was the same as the Napoleons. Rugelah (Chocolate and Raspberry) - Looked Good, but let down by their bland puff pastry. It's sad to say but the Walmart bakery ones are much, much better. Chocolate chip cookie drop thingys (can't remember the name) - Again these had minimal flavor. Mini-cheesecakes - blech. I'll say no more.  I didn't try the special frosted cookies but at $2.80 each it seemed very expensive price to pay inside the bakery they're made. After all it's not like they have high distribution costs to pay for when travelling 20ft from the kitchen to the display case. And at $2.80 I expect a more professional looking effort at coloring the cookies.  However, I did like the service! The girl working there was friendly, helpful and would be an asset to any store.

I love the food selection at this place!  As someone who spent many years "across the pond" I've learned to appreciate good european food.  My top foodie recommendations at this store:  - Torani sugar free Black Cherry syrup and CostPlus sparkling water to make your own soda  - The fondue cheese packs  - Heinz cream of tomato soup  If you try just these 3 things you will glimpse nirvana!

A good cut, by barbers who take pride in their work.  The price is either $15 or $17 for a cut and neck trim depending on whether they think you'll tip them.  The place is run by, and employs Russian Jewish immigrants, which is only relevent if you want a cut on Saturday since it's closed, but mighty useful on a Sunday!  What I particularly love about this barber is that the staff won't press you with inane drivel and endless questions to strike up a conversation that'll be forgotten as soon as you walk out the door.  If you want to talk, they'll talk but if you want to watch TV (shark week was on and I couldn't peel my eyes away) then that's fine by them.

I've found the mechanics here to be honest, competent and interested in making customers for life.  What more could you want in your mechanic? They also provide a free shuttle, free coffee and free bottles water on a hot day and once you're on the mailing list they'll send you coupons for your next service.

Okay, so can be a bit understaffed and I haven't tried most of the menu...  But, they have the best damn waffles I've ever had, anywhere in America!!!

Is it Authentic? - yes.  But...I wanted to like this place and I can't. Maybe because I'm not a fan over-salted greasy sonoran food with the loud speakers from an over-amplified one man band 5 feet from my ears while I'm trying to hold a conversation. The indigestion was not a pleasant souvenir.  If I want very loud music, I'll go to a concert but it's not appropriate at a "family restaurant".  Put it this way - my (almost) 4 year old was on the edge of tears because her ears were hurting from the crappy music.    Next time I'm here and want Mexican food, I think I'll just go to Teakwoods Tavern in the same parking lot and order Nacho's and a bucket of Coronas instead.

This is a small place that clearly show the love of the owners.  I found it to be spotlessly clean despite having older furnishing and decor and the food is made one order at a time.  That means it's a dollar or two more than the chain places like Shlotskys and Subway that're on the other side of Thomas Road, but the quality of the ingredients is like, 200% better.  Next time I need a fix of good Greek / Eastern mediteranean food I will be back for sure. Their tzatziki is just perfect - cooling, yet hot at the same time from generous amounts of garlic.  They do commercial catering too, so if you're looking for a office lunch that's different, definitely give them a try.  And don't forget CASH ONLY means no debit cards! BTW That's a shout out for the dude who came in behind me who said "what, not even debit cards?"

Update MAY 5 2011: OH CHUY'S, HOW I WILL MISS THEE!! Unfortunately for society as a whole, Chuy's didn't pay the rent and they've been closed down.  I tried to go 2 days ago and there's a sign on the door talking about a Landlord's Lien for non-payment of rent.  Oh well, time to head to Two Hippies instead. They do nice Taco's too.  ------------------ Cheap Eats, Free Chips and Salsa, good $2 margheritas all day and night!  Did I mention cheap? My wife and I can usually eat well and both have a drink or two for less than $20 including a tip during happy hour.  I love this place - This is how a chain should be! Tasty food, feels local even though it's not and a staff that takes care of you without ever being in your face. My heart has fallen hard for the broiled mesquite fish Tacos, or the chicken tacos. The broiled fish tacos are the best I've had anywhere. I generally stay away from the steak dishes because they aren't as good but I don't hold that against them. It's just that Baja California food is best served as fish or chicken, 'nuff said. Here's a tip - If you don't like the rice they serve on a combo plate then you can usually substitute in an extra protion of beans or cabbage salad instead to keep it low carb.

I kept getting suckered by the coupons, but I've stopped going here since whenever they "fix" something, I often find myself at 25th St Automotive a few weeks later getting it permanently fixed.  But, they do free brake inspections and if you make sure they install OEM brake parts instead of advertised specials which WILL squeek badly then BM can be a good option.  For that service alone I wouldn't write them off.

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy! I've been coming to this place regularly for about 5 years, from the time that my wife and I were a couple, to having a newborn baby and now a toddler.  The food has without fail been good. The only bad experience I had was when I decided to be adventurous and try some unfamiliar authentic Vietnamese dishes. What can I say - some flavors don't translate across cultures...  The staff are nice, without being in your face friendly like at a American casual dining restaurant. Top recommendations - The Shrimp and Pork Spring rolls for a starter Either the Bun, or the lemon grass beef for a main dish. (As a fair warning to you, the lemon grass beef can have a high sodium content if you're sensitive to it)

The beds define the word "superlative" and the rest of the hotel is well maintained, clean and and welcoming.   Yeah, I'd stay there again.  The location is great for Scottsdale since old town is on the door step and the fashion square mall is just a short, but pleasant walk away.  The breakfast buffet is the typical high quality HGI breakfast. I'm so glad I get it for free as a hilton honors gold member, but it would still be worth paying for otherwise.  Unfortunately, the nacho's served at Jake's in the evening were amongst the saltiest and worst I've ever tasted and the house wine was simply horrific, but at least our "meal" of nacho's and dessert was totally redeemed by a very tasty banana split.

I'm originally from Hong Kong so I can tell you from personal experience that this is as authentic as you can get for a Hong Kong cafe style restaurant.  The foods tasty too, but it's only good value if you're there for the lunchtime menu or the dim sum.  But, if you're in a business situation and want to dine some out of town guests...I'd recommend this for lunch or dinner without hesitation. They even have private dining rooms if you want them.

Salt levels are high enough to be legally classified as a food preservative!  I got the double fried noodles with pork, shrimp and vegetables.  Well, they DROWNED the dish with enough salty sauce (maybe 1.5-2 cups) to make it more like a soup than anything else.  Also, It was a struggle to find more than a few shavings on meat in the dish, disappointing.  I'm pretty sensitive to salt in my food because of my blood pressure and my best estimate is that this one dish probably had 5,000mg sodium in it.  Ambience - I appreciate the effort to be helpful, but we were brusquely interupted 9 times during our lunch.  Come on people - if my water glass is empty then discreetly fill it up, don't ask me LOUDLY if I want more water while interupting my conversation. At that point, you're not providing good service, it's just amateurish crap.  Would I go back? If I did, I'd order something very lite on the sauce, but then I'd discover that I'd ordered a meat and veg dish with minimal meat and veg.  So, what's the point coming back?  So PF Changs - BFD that you sponsor a marathon!? - what good is that when you make people sick afterwards with your insanely salty food, eh?

Went there for lunch today and here's my take - Great Service, but the food is best eaten when drunk because it's meh, and still at Scottsdale downtown prices.  All in all, for food I'd rather go to Chuy's at 32nd St &Thomas Rd seven days a week instead.  However...it did look like a fun place to hang out on a Friday night so I might be back for  a beer in the future!

3.5 stars I love the food here, and being British I know a genuine pasty when I see one. These are the genuine article. And the place isn't pretentious at all, which is cool.  However, if you're sensitive to salt for your blood pressure like I am then you might want to think twice before ordering.  I'm not sure if it's in the fillings, the gravy, or the pastry itself but the salt content in a pasty from here can be really high.  That doesn't stop me from coming back, but still...

Just had a Roast Beef and Gorgonzola sandwich for lunch there.  Hot Damn, that was some fine eating!  I think I'll come back again, and again, and again.  BTW - breakfast is now served until 2:00pm on the weekends (10:30am during the week)   They open at 6:00am M-F and 7:00am on the weekends  Parking is very tight for the lunchtime crowd, so try to be there NLT that 11:40am or you may not get a spot since there's more restaurants in that plaza than places to park! If you're just popping in to pick up a to-go order, this won't be an issue since they have the some to-go parking in front of the door.

Mouth-Wateringly-Goooood-Food!  Nothing on the menu is over 500 calories and the owner is a doctor-nutritonist who spent a lot of effort on craft the menu. It really shows in the quality of what's to offer.  Everything looked good and smelled awesome, but in the end one always has to make a choice. So, my wife and I ended up going for the Chickpea Ceviche starter, then Lamb Kebobs and Chicken Curry with extra pappadoms instead of naan to keep it 100% gluten free.  All 3 dishes were a smash hit and washed down with a perfect Mango Lassi drink. Delish. (Wait a sec - the picture that Jessica F uploaded of the 2 dishes and a drink was my lunch!)  I'm so looking forward to coming back here for another taste buds extravaganza!  The only thing I'd change is that the 2 page menu to download from their website is a whopping 9MB file - it's time to fix that people!

Cici's is my go to place for a pizza buffet. Why? It's cheap, tasty enough and the cinnamon rolls are awesome.  The salad selection's lame, but what the heck I only add that onto the plate to kid myself I'm eating healthy...  Value for money?: I'd value this lunch at $6.49, but since it's usually cheaper then I always feel like I get a good deal. For me that pushes it from a solid 3-star place into a 4-star place.

I went here today during the New Years celebration at the Vietnamese cultural center and I was really impressed on every front.  Service - The service was really friendly and they considerate for our 3 year old daughter. Appetizers came out rapidly and the main courses (pho for me and the mother in law, bun for my wife) came out at exactly the right time with genuine smiles.  Food - On the outside I was smiling, on the inside I was having a "When Harry met Sally" moment! I had the Pho with vegetables and rare steak. IT WAS AWESOME. The steak arrived rare within the Pho, but within a few minutes the hot liquid had gently cooked the steak throughout.  The pho was just a little bit salty (not bad though) so go easy on drinking it at the end but it created the perfect balance for flavouring the noodles and vegetables within it.  In hindsight, even though I'm sensitive to salty food I wouldn't have have changed a thing since the beef broth flavor infused into the ingredients so well.   FOOD ALLERGIES:  I'm always concerned about MSG in my food since I'm allergic to it and my wife and daughter are allergic to gluten. Well, we had no problems here. After we were done we were chatting to the owner and he was explaining their philosophy on cooking. They prepare everything from scratch with no MSG or artificial ingredient including the pho soup base and the fish ball and beef meatballs. He was explaining that the fish balls are simply flaked fish that's mixed with spices then reformed into balls (same for the beef balls too). He said he has a special technique for this that not everyone can master without adding fillers such as bread and that not everyone can do it. Who am I to argue? all I know is that next time I go I'll be ordering them.  Prices: $7.50 to $8.25 for main meals  Overall: Bloody Brilliant!

It's like going to East Africa without getting on a plane.  I just went there for lunch today, and let me say that for 1/2 an hour I sure wasn't in America any more - it was an immersive and tasty experience that I'm sure to do again, soon.   For a start, they didn't have a menu, so I asked what the lunch special was and he started saying a few things in a strong (Somali/Ethiopian) Arabic accent that included goat, so I said - "Sure I'll try it" without really knowing what was going to happen.    And now to the experience. He brought me a can of Pepsi (no diet drinks here and I didn't wan't to risk the ice cubes in the water) and gives me a fork, a spoon and a banana. Whatever, I think "well this is different" as I wonder when to eat my banana. As I'm drinking my Pepsi I started looking around and realize that the only other people are male east african taxi drivers eating injera and curry with just their RIGHT hand.  Well it's a good thing I know how to do that too! (because I didn't want to stand out even more than is possible as the lone white guy speaking english in a restaurant full of genuine Africans speaking Arabic).  Then the food arrives - a huge plate of buttered rice seasoned with green herby flecks of stuff and smelling delightful. And the guy says - "you wanted goat - yes? Because it's grilling and will be out soon" So I said yes and started on the rice. A minute later a huge plate of cubed goat and a side salad with Italian dressing comes out and lands in front of me.  I say cubed goat because that's was happened to this poor beastie.  The meat consisted of apparently random 2-3 inch cubed chunks of goat ribs and legs complete with attached tendons, a couple of arteries, some fat, muscle meat (steak) and so on. It tasted GREAT! Seasoned well, and grilled with seasoned onions too.  The other customers - As I was eating my rice, salad and goat with just my right hand, more of the regular clientele came in and looked universally stunned to see me there. When they looked down, saw that I was eating with just my right hand in the same Arab manner as them, in mere seconds they accepted me as just another diner at lunchtime. It was actually really cool to see the waryness and prejudice on their faces evaporate in seconds to be replaced by acceptance.  Would I go there again - heck yeah! But, and here's a BIG but. I wouldn't ever go with that person at the office that we all know, you know - the one who makes loud and snarky (sometimes racist) comments when they feel uncomfortable in a new situation.  At lunchtime the Tariq Restaurant is a working (East African Arab) man's lunch place.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a women-only group to go for lunch and feel comfortable.  If you're a woman and want great East African food, then this is the place, but from the vibe in there I reckon you'll enjoy it more if you go in with a man, or in a mixed group.

I like this Teakwoods!  The beer flows cheaply, the staff are really friendly and many of the customers in there smile as new folks walk in the door too.  It's not often you find a place like this that has an overall happy vibe.  Pros: - The portions are BIG - The staff are great - They sometimes do groupons - They support the local community through things like participating in the Indian School Street fair - They give you peanuts to shell and trash the floor with which somehow appeals to the inner kid in me. - The beer is cheap  Con's - none that I've found

HOW THIS LOCATION SAVED MY WAISTLINE!  Okay, first let me get this one straight, I like fast food burgers - a lot. But, that day finally came (and it comes to us all) when I thought "Hey these jeans are too tight, I suppose I should put on my fat pants instead" Only to realize "OMG! These ARE my fat pants! aaargh".  That was it, the moment had finally arrived when in-between sorrowful sniffs the road forked in two directions. My lovely wife asks what's wrong and all I could say was "nothing, sniff, sniff" and when she asked if I'd like to go out to dinner to cheer up I heard the voices on my shoulder talking to me. I had to make a choice. Did I?  A) Embrace the devil on my left shoulder and go for it whilst casually mentioning that all my clothes were so last season and we should go shopping together tonight too! B) Listen to that long forgotten voice on my right shoulder saying "HAR, HAR, You just got reality checked! Now do something about it." Well, after another 5 minutes of futilely looking in the closet for clothes that fit, then seriously considering if the credit card could take the beating of a of new wardrobe of clothes I let the top button on my jeans stay open and finally decided that enough was enough, it's time to take the second choice...but I was damned if I was going to give up burgers while doing it.  So, here's what I did. After a year of eating out too much, and a new baby in the house I knew it would have to be cheap, so I cast aside thoughts of Subway and went to my old Favorite - McDonalds! The very next day I started myself on what I came to call "The McDonalds Dollar Menu Diet". I posted it to my Facebook page and at first my friends thought I was kidding until they saw the weight continue to come off, week after week.  For lunch 4-5 days a week at this location (and a couple of dinners a week) I would have a McDouble, a Side Salad with Paul Newman's low fat Balsamic Vinaigrette or low fat Italian salad dressing and either water or a large Diet Coke or large unsweetened Ice Tea. It cost me just $3.27 per meal including tax! I was filled up, had energy and a balanced diet. If I skipped the drink it was only $2.18 per meal.  This diet I chose and stuck to has put me from borderline obese back to the lean healthy figure I last had 10 years ago. Thanks McDonalds!  30 lbs later I swear that I never want to go back to what I was, but I still eat my "McDonalds Dollar Menu Diet" at least twice a week because it tastes so good. (Actually, I just finished another one for lunch...)  So, instead of blaming McDonalds for supersizing America I now happily say thanks for the healthy choices!

Did a great, professional job and after billing the insurance company directly sent us a check for $50 for our business.  And the staff taking calls at the main office were pretty swell too!  All right, so they were supposed to come from 10-12 and turned up at 12:15pm, but it only took 'em 25 minutes to get the job done.  Would I recommend them to others? You betcha!

Here's a disclaimer: I usually just use the automated wash here since it's good, cheap and I only stay for the minimum time possible.  But it's around the corner from my house so it's become the default place to go.  Prices: It's a typical wash your own car wash in Phoenix. Uses quarters.  Safety: Not really. This is one of the few places in America that I wish I had a concealed weapons permit and I was packing heat.  A couple of years ago  I arrived 30 seconds after an armed car jacking.  Since then I've been more aware of my surrounding and become more wary of some of the other clientelle.  Lots of angry men who are head over heels in love with their below average, but shiny-wheeled cars.  Overall: Use the automated car wash they've installed in the north bay. It's good value. But don't stay longer than necessary.

I first used these guys a year ago for an oil change on a used 2008 Mazda 5 I'd purchased elsewhere.   Well, that got me on their mailing list...which in this case was a good thing!  Since then, then whole service department has been rebuilt and the Mazda/Subaru service is combined with the Subaru showroom.   A few weeks ago I'd received a notification that there was a recall on my power steering rack and would I please come in and have it fixed.  But, I also received a coupon in the mail from the dealership for a free oil change or a free loaner car with any service.  Since I really needed the transmission flushed it seemed like the right thing to do, especially as the power steering fluid was past due for changing as well anyhow.  When I got there, Iain Wooley (one of the service reps) cheerily told me that he'd honor both coupons and BTW the oil change included a vehicle inspection.  When I picked up the car in the afternoon he told me that they'd found a broken hydraulic engine mount that had lost all it's oil, but since it was still just inside the powertrain warranty they'd taken the initiative to go ahead and replace it since they had the part in stock and already had the car up on the rack. Nice!   My total cost was just 1 transmission flush that used Mazda synthetic fluid ($169) The total work: Transmission flush, power steering tack repair and flush, oil change (semi-synthetic valvoline), rental car and engine motor mount.  I love warranties and responsible dealerships.  If you know exactly the services your car needs, then dealership service actually ends up costing less in the end than using Brake Masters or Meineke or any of the other generic chains because it just takes one visit to fix.

Tasty, Big Taco's.  Now that Chuy's has closed down I think I'll be here a lot more, and I'll always to remember to order extra for lunch the next day.  The food isn't stellar, but it is tasty, great value and better than I can make at home. In my book, that's good enough to make me a repeat customer.  I'm not sure if they have a licence to sell beer yet, but even so, it's worth popping in if you're in the neighborhood.  I think it's cash only so don't forget to head to the bank 2 blocks north first.
