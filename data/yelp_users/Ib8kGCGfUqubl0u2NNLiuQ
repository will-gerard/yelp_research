Anyone who knows me will tell you that this is my favorite place on earth. I know that it sounds like an exaggeration. It is not. EVERYTHING is phenomenal here.   "The Duck" is my measuring stick for every other sandwich shop and deli.   Your first time here may be a little confusing, because your order will be taken on a paper bag and there are a lot of options. You should feel safe in the knowledge that no matter what you get you will be happy.   My favorites are:  Traditional sandwich.... Roast Beef or Smoked Turkey on any of the breads, with mayo, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, add sprouts.   Feeling like tuna? Alabcore tuna on toasted ciabatta, with no celery, add sprouts, with lettuce, tomato, and swiss cheese. The Albacore as a salad is a great option if you are not eating breads at the time (which would be tragic because all of their bread is fresh and perfect).  Uncommon... Italian Dry Salami on sourdough with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, and swiss cheese. Just do it.   Get the tea of the day. Browse the wine and beer room, consider getting a coffee drink at some juncture, and peruse all of the knick knacks and food stuffs. They'll call your name when it is ready.  I have had just about everything on the menu. No, I HAVE had everything on the menu.   I am partial to the swiss cheese because I have not been able to find cheese like that anywhere else, but if you like cheddar (some of  you do) then try the Longhorn- it is the same price as the swiss, any other cheese will cost you extra. If you like cheese in general, then do yourself a favor and get a cheese tray, call some friends, get some wine, and relax. Get a sandwich to share with your pals, you don't want to make them jealous.

I have been to a buffet like this before, but I will never go to this particular one again.   The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky. We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill.   The cook doused our dishes with water, quickly cooked the ingredients, and returned them in a new bowl.   There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite.   Free-range and refills on beverages.   Sat down to eat, was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting. The bowl of ingredients were all bland, perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling, and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad, The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well. We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving. Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me, and changes in selections.   We could have taken the left overs home, but opted to leave them instead.   Suffice to say, I do NOT recommend.

BLUEBERRY PIE  Get it. Eat it. Fall in LOVE.   We drive to Prescott every other weekend or so, to see my mother. This weekend we commited ourselves to stop at the Rock Springs Cafe & General Store, mostly being that we always say we will stop there but never do... but also because we were curious about the place. I mean, have you seen the sign? I always think the picture is a slice of pizza, not PIE. But it is a pie place soooo...  Based upon this first visit (WHY DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG?!), I can certainly say that we will be back.   There was a wide selection of pies. Delicious looking pies, like cherry, apple, rhubarb, coconut cream, lemon merengue, banana cream, precan. We saw a lot of crumbles also. Such blueberry, cherry, apple, etc. I think there may have been a strawberry also. However, I am not partial to crumbles. So my eyes were drawn elsewhere. There was also a wide assortment of other little goodies, but not labels on all of them so I am not quite sure what they were... I know for certain there were some sticky buns (which looked quite sticky, in all the right ways). The large soda fountain was hard to miss too. I bet they make a killer root beer float.   Cute decor. Not too hokey. Just real. Completely authentic feeling.  There is a saloon, too! Seemed to have a live band playing some pretty dance-able country music.   My husband picked up a six pack of some Flag Brew beer. Wapiti. Very hoppy- by the way- but cool to find a local brew in cans at a pie shop/saloon/restaurant(?).   Now, about the pie:  When I cut my piece out I noticed how well everything stayed together. There was no blob of disconcerting gel oozing from the sides. All of the blueberries were clinging to each other, huddled under a golden crust.   Crust is perfect. Very simple. Flaky.   Filling was sheer blueberry bliss. Not the syrup-laden pie filling that any joe schmo can buy in a can. These were some fresh, REAL, blueberries. Each berry with its' own note of flavor. All coming together seamlessly to fill the pie.   I was surprised at how light the piece of pie was. I had certainly cut to small of a piece. So I had another. I am quite certain, at this very moment, that I could have yet another piece and I would feel the same.   Light. Refreshing.   What a fantastic summer pie.   I must try more!

We've just started coming here, and I'm consistently pleased with the service and the food. The pizzas are huge, my husband loves the wings but I order an entree and my boys get a kid's plate.   There's often a special going on and parking can be tight, so show up early!

I am pretty sure that I have reviewed this place already, but I sort of feel like every time we go here I fall in love all over again!  I just ate the left overs from last night, because I couldn't manage to finish my plate after having one of the "Casa Margaritas" and enough chips to put me in a certain food coma... The left overs were just as good this morning as they were last night! DUH.   This place has the best everything in town. No joke.   Do yourself a favor, if you like spinach, get the Spinach Enchiladas dinner.   And don't leave without trying the house margarita. On the rocks. With salt.   Just do it.

I just picked-up a loaf of souurdough and zuccini bread at the Phoenix Public Market. I am so impressed with the quality of the breads! The people who helped me at the market were also SUPER wonderful. I will certainly be purchasing more from this company in the future.

Five stars IS NOT ENOUGH!!  Great price for a great doggy doo.   We took our Yorkiepoo, Jack, to get his awesome little self groomed today.   We were met by a friendly staff who whisked little Jack away in their arms. They asked a few questions about what we expected and off he went!  We got a call about an hour later letting us know that he was ready to come home. Since we were expecting it to take longer (PetSmart takes like half a day) we were out running errands. They looked after Jack for us until we could come get him.   When I came to pick our boy up he was happily hanging out in a comfy kennel.   We love his cut and he came home very very happy.   No more PetSmart for us. FOR SURE.   Great price, too!

I always drive by but never know exactly what this place had to offer, now that I do I will certainly be a regular!   Tonight we ordered gnocchi for the kids, the mahi special for me, and tortellini for my hubs.   Everything was spectacular!   The place was packed and there were several people picking up orders to go. The wait didn't see long, we were seated right when we got in.   I can't wait to eat my left overs (and the boys' too)!

I always forget how expenssive Bumble and Bumble salons and stuff are...   I do like my cut and color.   Rafael was very sweet also.   I like a little more energy and conversation when I am saloning though, I know that not everyone does, but I do. I am very talky talky.   If it weren't so expenssive I would certainly go back. I will have to think on it though, just because of the cost... I am not used to spending 130 on cut and color! : (

Enticed by half price appetizers, wasn't impressed. Ordered calamari, potato skins, carpaccio. All of the garnish was old and brown. The calamari was cold. The carpaccio had old disgusting onions and smelled terrible. Potato skins were very greasy. Not worth it. Not even at half price.

I read a few yelp reviews before checking this place out, and the high ratings are right-on! We had a few rolls, Shrimp Tempura, Salmon and Scallop, Crazy Kid, and Salmon Tempura to start. SO AMAZING.   We also had a Tempura appetizer.. I guess you could say that we like fried stuff a little. The veggies were crisp, the yams were cooked perfectly aslo (not soggy like I have had at other places), and the shrimp was obviously fresh.   I had one of the Udons, mine came with two delicious fishcakes, mushrooms (enoki maybe?), one tempura shrimp, and the perfect amount/type of seaweed. I have long loved Udon, but now I have a favorite in Phoenix for which to compare all others in the area.   My husband had the Terryaki Chicken and he didn't say a word while eating. This is a very good sign. When he doesn't like his food he talks about something to avoid eating it. He barely shared a bite with me. Even though I tasted an onion in my bite, it was savory nonetheless.   I am willing to bet that you will be elated by anything that you order on their menu. I cannot wait to come back.

I read the yelp reviews and thought that this was a gamble, but it paid-off for me!  The girl taking my order was super sweet, but not too helpful on the desert selections. I ordered the Amante Special and a slice of Cheesecake with a sides of chocolate and strawberry (no extra charge!).   She said that the pizza would arrive in about 45 minutes but delivery was prompt at almost 30 minutes. The delivery guy had enough change for my $100 bill, but I had also asked BEFORE my order so that I would know if he could break it.   Unfortunately there was no chocolate sauce, but I survived nonetheless. It was on the reciept, so I am assuming there was some sort of a mix-up/oversight as my order was headed out the door.  The crust on this pizza was awesome, not too thin and not too greasy. The toppings were exactly as the menu had stated. There was the perfect amount of sauce. We are eating left overs today (just as good on day two), the pizza was HUGE!  The slice of Cheesecake was nothing to write home about, quite meager in fact. The strawberry sauce was nice, but still nothing mind-shattering.   We will definitely be ordering from here again, it is right around the corner from our house and we REALLY want to try some of their other dishes!

I have a friend who might as well live here, so when he suggested that we meet him I was curious to see why. As it turns out, it might be because of their alcohol options as opposed to their food options.   The soup options looked tasty, so I went for one while we waited for our friend to show. I ordered the leek soup. The soup itself was nearly a revalation, but I was not a fan of the bread. I love bread, so this was a little sad for me. The soup was creamy, had just the right amount of cheese, and somehow managed to not be overly leeky. Five stars on soup.  There was an impressive amount of beer options, according to my husband.  I ordered The Pilgrim. The dough was delicious, as was the turkey. I could have done without the large slices of onion and par-cooked yams (which didn't taste very "Thanksgiving" to me anyway). When I caught a bit of stuffing it made me very happy. I didn't like the gravy, but didn't need it anyway as the pasty was not dry. There was also a side of cranberry relish. I ate it all and took an additional cup home for my left overs (the soup was filling).  The second half of my pasty came home and spent the night in our fridge. It was far better having rested there for the evening. I was impressed with how much more I liked the pasty on day 2.  Four stars on pasty alone.  Seating indoors was strange, not suited for a couple having a dinner date, but ok for drinks. Seems as if though the bench-seating and dark atmosphere would be cool for pre-game drinking, perhaps with a large group of friends. It was slow when we were there, which I understand may be uncommon.

This place has the BEST PANCAKES I have ever had, IN MY LIFE.   It would be foolish on your part to not make it a point in your life to eat ANYTHING here.   Eveyone that I was with enjoyed their meals. Well, we more than enjoyed our meals. I don't now that there is word for how much I loved my pancakes.  They are absolutely massive and delicious. The edges are a little crispy. They must cook them in some type of magical laboratory... with butter.   The other people I was with had a BLT and a grilled chicken sandwich. The BLT was certainly not skimpy on the bacon and the chicken in the grilled chicken sandwich was moist and delectable.   Go to Otto's now. NOW I tell you.

I had such high hopes. I wanted a celebration of vegetables, in all of their glory! But all we got was fake-meat-product and oddly pie-eyed cultiness....  We have been driving by "Loving Hut" since we moved into the area, and since I was once vegan and am more more of a vegetarian, I have been hopelessly seeking some good veggie options for eating out.   Unfortunately, this was not it.   First off, I am sure that I am not the first person to say this, but,fake meat product, in any form, is gross. It might look meat-like, but it is not meat-like in the taste department. I have never met anyone that was swayed into not eating meat by the introduction of meat-imitation. Just sayin'.   Speaking of being swayed: I felt like "Loving Hut" is a little cultish. There were video monitors with a show or channel called "Master" somethingrather and the two women talking on it were also in pictures and books all around the restaurant. Us non-meat-eaters already get a bad rap for being culty and pushy when we talk about our dietary choices (which, duh, you should be abiding by too) and I felt like that vibe was totally perpetuated in this place.   As far as the food goes, it was, eh, ok. OK at best, mind you. I think that had there been NO fake meats in just about everything on the menu it would have been a different story... Maybe.   We were served little soups before our meal which were tasty (but I had ordered the Pho, so I was like on soup-overload by the end of it all), the broth was yumtown. We also got some spring rolls which were non traditional, but pretty good. Same veggies as were in the mini soup, for a veggie place I exprected more variety I guess. My  husband got tons of fake meat product (one was fried and it tasted like fried, so duh it was good).   It was pretty in there, too. But the cultishness eeked the decor up to creep level 9, by the time we left.   Summize to say, I am still in search of a veggie friendly restaurant,

Awesome ambiance, friendly staff, delicious food.   My friend landed a groupon for Le Chalet so we went to check it out.  Ordered the Pate de Campagne and the Traditional Flammenkuchen as appetizers. We were immediately impressed! The pate was perfection, very creamy and not too fatty, accompanied by crisp bread. The flammenkuchen was like a pizza without red sauce, covered in cheese with some hidden onions and bacon. SO GOOD.  We followed this up with the Swiss Cheese Fondue. This came with french bread squares (you can have toased, we did) and apples. The fondue was by far the best I have had in a restaurant, the perfect combination of it's ingredients. We invested all of our energy into consuming every last drip of the fondue.   I would like to say that we spent some time eating some other entrees, but as soon as we saw someone else getting dessert... we couldn't help ourselves.  We ordered the Nutella Crepe, Lemon and Sugar Crepe, and Carmel Fondue. This was no easy decision, as you will understand when you see their dessert menu. Luckily for us, I don't think that it much mattered what we would have ordered, as I felt that it was a sure bet that everything would hav been equally as delicious. We watched them make our crepes on closed-circuit tv. Then, we faught over every last bite of each desert, and I would have gladly bathed in the Carmel Fondue.   I ordered a decaf coffee during dessert and it came in a single serving french press, also. How cool is that?!  Le Chalet will soon be seeing us on a regular basis. Guaranteed. There are about 10-13 more deserts that I will need to conquer and the list of Meat Specialties will certainly require some of my attention as well (the presentation of the La Potence was very intriguing)!

If you've been looking for a chance to enjoy anything Cityscape... this will be a pro on the list!   I purchased a Living Social coupon for a Brazilian wax, eyebrow shaping, and pedicure. I was looking for a spa anyway and had always been curious about the famed "Brazilian" so it was a win-win.   If you are in the market for some landscaping, full body, first time or just a little, I recommend Caroline, she is a FIVE star esthetician. I was surprised at the pleasant nature of the whole "ripping hair out of my body at an alarming rate" and I attribute this solely to the company and expertise of Caroline. I booked a follow-up appointement immediately. That's how serious I am. Also, they are running a special that saves you $$ if you book three appointments, I think you pay upfront though. They also EMAIL YOU A REMINDER (how convinient is THAT?@).  As far as the pericure goes: I have had better and I have had worse, so I suppose this is a solid 3. The chairs were old car seats, which look cool but are not very comfortable (granted I am pregnant and am rarely comfortable, but I thought I might actually fall out). Not to mention that you are seated on what is a two-step elevated platform, so it is cumbersome to get up AND down. The quality of polish was nice, the technique used to soften my footsies was pleasant, but I didn't feel very relaxed. In fact, I felt more relaxes when I was having all of my hair ripped out with hot wax (how is that for odd?). I do not recall the name of my pedicurist.

The best pickle I have ever tasted. My only regret is finding this so late in my life.   The owner was increadibly nice, too. She even held my bags for me while I went to purchase some roses (which took longer than I had expected).   Belinda's Pickles are a quality product, the maker pays special attention to detail and does her grandmother's recipe proud!!!  I don't know if she has a shop somewhere, I bought my pickles at the Phoenix Public Market. If you are there, DO NOT MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY.

I have to admit, walking in to this place was almost like a dream come true.   The only down-side was being plagued with the loud voice in my head screaming "why didn't I think of this?"  Seriously.   You can customize your roll to be exactly what you want, no matter how silly or slight. Pricing isn't too steep, either. Now let's make a roll...  Want to go traditional with white rice and nori? No problem. Oh, you like brown rice? No problem. Want soy paper instead? No problem.   Now pick some veggies. Don't like avocado? DON'T CHOOSE THAT THEN. Don't want any veggies? YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET THEM (this aint your mama's roll)!  Hate the crab and mayo mix? SKIP IT. Pick WHATEVER YOU LIKE (salmon, tuna, spicy or not, egg, cream cheese, go nuts people)!  Do what YOU want. Smile. Be happy. Watch it all happen in front of your very eyes...   THEN!  It gets rolled up tightly and sliced.   Now you can add sauce or "toppings" (I do sort of feel like this term should change). They even have some custom sauces!   I mean, the only thing missing here was for someone to feed me the rolls.   Seriously.   It is a casual atmosphere but it feels hip. Would be nice if there was a bar nearby- oh wait, there is! Across the street. Would be nice to drink on the patio though... This is how the only got four stars out of me.  Great. Now I wish I lived in the neighborhood.   Well, time to start house shopping. Or maybe I should just open a franchise...

I frequent this shopping center and had high hopes when I saw that a mail salon was coming in.   My expectations were exceeded by the quality of service, atmosphere and professionalism.   I experienced the most luxurious pedicure... Te kid dreams and fantasies are made of: with rose pedals, citrus hot stones and a leg mask.   My manicure and gels still look fabulous.   I can't wait to go back for more!

Jason just saved me from the most anxiety-ridden morning of the year!   We woke up to no water in the house and he trouble-shot with us some options and then took care of isolating the issue. There's more work to be done but he alleviated the initial anxiety at an affordable price and I can breathe again.   Very satisfied!
