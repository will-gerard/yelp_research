I absolutely love this restaurant!  We came with a party of seven and we got a table with a gorgeous view. We had our appetizers and while we were waiting for our entrees our server recommended that we go outside and look at the view.. I didn't know that was a cue and my fianc√© proposed here! I couldn't be happier! It was a beautiful view, the staff was incredibly nice (our server was AWESOME!) and the food was absolutely delicious! We cannot wait to return for our anniversary!

I love their food! I always eat the smoked brisket with mac n cheese and coleslaw.. My husband always gets the two meat combo with mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. We love the mac n cheese and the doughnuts they give complimentary!  The only thing I would say is try to make reservations because there is usually always a wait.

Wow what a disgrace..  My husband and I picked this hotel for our wedding night because he proposed inside the restaurant and thought it would be romantic.  Worst idea we have ever had.  My soon to be husband picked the most premium room, and requested roses candles and what not.  When we got in the room after our wedding, after such a long day we were just looking forward to relaxing, that never happened.  We checked in  and we got our ride to the room. First of all, it didn't look like the resort that it advertise sit to be. It looked like a motel.  When we got our room, we never got the roses and candles that we requested, but we did get a bathroom infested with ants and above the bed on ceiling, big nasty cob webs. I was not comfortable sleeping like that so we called and we were put in another room.  It seemed fine, I didn't notice any ants or cob webs but in the morning my husband found a cockroach(!!) on the floor! A cockroach ladies and gentlemen!  Awful way to start our honeymoon worst mistake of our lives.

My husband and I went in on a Sunday afternoon because we both heard so much about the Melting Pot. To be fair, going in we read how we would be boiling our food and we were skeptical right then but gave it a shot. We walked in and there was a blonde hostess that was incredibly rude. She looked at us when we came in and didn't say one word. I was standing literally right in front of her and she never had the decency to say, "welcome to ..." I've worked a long time in the restaurant field, I know what is required and this girl should not be working around people. She continued to ignore us and took some people to their table and another hostess came and we told her we have a reservation. She was sweet, just how a hostess should be.  Our server was awesome that's why I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1, I can't remember her name but she was very friendly.  We ordered cheddar fondue and when we tasted it, there was just something lacking to the taste, it was very bland. The salads came out tasty, but the entrees, my husband got the steak lovers, I got the shrimp, chicken, and steak.  Our server told us to keep the food in the pot for 2 minutes and that's more than enough, shrimp 1 min 30 sec.. The chicken was not finished at 2 minutes it actually took 4 minutes, which I have no problem waiting longer but if that happened to someone who doesn't know, they could have gotten sick..  The shrimp looked and smelled awful.. My husband tried some and he has a high tolerance for food, and he could not eat the shrimp because of how bad the taste was.  The only good thing we had was the s'mores chocolate. That was amazing if you like chocolate. So go for dessert, but eat dinner somewhere else.

My husband and I came here almost anytime we wanted to do date night for dinner and a movie. However, I don't think we will be coming back after such an awful experience tonight.  We went to see the Hobbit at 9:45 pm. I arrived at our seats around 9:25-9:30 and wait. Normally I never had an issue with service and always got my drinks quickly.  That's why when my husband came from the restroom he was surprised that no one came to me.  We waited and the movie already started when we asked 2 different servers if we can put our order in or get our server. One of them had the audacity to say "I'm not your server"... Ok can you get us our server?  I worked on the restaurant business so I know how you should act and that's definitely not the way to be in the hospitality industry.  It was about 10:10 when our server finally came to us to get our drinks and order.  I ordered grilled cheese and tomato bisque and my husband ordered Angus Trio Sliders with sweet potato fries and with brownie ice cream for desert. Food was ok nothing special but was very disappointed when we never received them.. We got our plates taken away from someone other than  our server and our server came about 15 minutes after that.. Keep in mind the movie is going and our server comes to check up on us and I told him we never got the fries and to make sure it's not on our bill. He never apologized he just said it won't be and left.  He came back after 20 minutes and asked me if we ordered dessert. I told him we orders the brownie ice cream from him.. Then he seemed confused. He asked me if we received the dessert I said no we ordered it but didn't not get. "Oh so you are it" I was so shocked how dumb this server was I almost yelled loudly but the movie was still playing.. I quietly said again, we ordered the brownie, have not received it and have not eaten it.. "Oh so you didn't order dessert." ............ *sigh* "sir we ordered the brownie ice cream but only got our entree that were missing our fries"  After about 5 minutes of going back and forth, he left and we got our dessert about 10 minutes after that.. Overall we got our dessert at 11:45..  The most disappointing part was that no one came to talk to us at the end or that they didn't try to do anything for is.. It's not that we wanted a free dinner or anything we just wanted to see the gesture..  What a disappointment.

I just want to say that Karen contacted me and wanted my phone number and email to contact me more. She contacted me 2 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything.  The reason why I'm saying this is because I saw that other people wrote that the same thing happened to them too

I am new in town and have had horrible experience with my hair dressers.. I wanted to get some highlights but something very subtle was always what I wanted.. My future sister in law said to join her here and I had my appointment with Michael. Best thing I have ever done. He was so nice and listened to everything I said. I told him how each time highlights came out too yellow for me and I was scared to get them with my wedding next month. I love my highlights and he told me he would rather go more subtle and then have me come back if I wanted them more bold vs having them too much on the first time. I definitely recommend Michael and can't wait to go back!
