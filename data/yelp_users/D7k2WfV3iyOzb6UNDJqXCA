I went to this Fry's to get kombucha (trendy fermented tea), as I've gotten it at other Fry's in the past. Upon arrival, I asked a check out girl where I could find it, and she had no idea what it was, but pointed me in the direction of the cold drink section. That section did not have any spots for kombucha, but there was one rogue bottle that had be mistakenly been placed there. I took the bottle to a gentleman who was stocking the drink section and asked him where I could find it, but he stated he had never seen it before. He helped me search, and upon failing to find it, got a manager involved. The manager had also never seen it before and was unable to find the section it had come from, so he got a produce attendant involved. In total, we searched for the long lost kombucha section for nearly 30 minutes to no avail. Then the gentlemen took the bottle in the back to investigate further. Upon returning, they advised that they had not started selling kombucha yet, but it was a new product they would be getting in soon. They had no idea how it found it's way out to the drink section, and ended up giving me the rogue bottle for free. Four stars for excellent customer service and free kombucha. Only missing one for the fact they don't sell kombucha yet, but that could change apparently. They have a great selection of vegan ice creams too!

This place is the worst. Everytime I have an appointment, I have to wait at least two hours past my appointment time to be seen. You don't even get taken back to a room until nearly an hour after your appointment time. They lose papers, constantly make clerical errors, and most of the receptionists are extremely snotty. I absolutely would not come here if they weren't the only place in my area that takes my insurance AND has late hours. I dread my visits. If you absolutely have to come here like I do, make sure you bring A LOT of things to entertain you.

Love, love, love. Haven't had a bad item here. The pasta e fagioli is to die for. The gnocchi is delectable. The ambiance is lovely. Generally a quiet spot. The service is good. My boyfriend's food came out a little later than the rest, so they brought us a round of lemoncello shots on the house. It is clear these people take pride in what they do. I will come here time and time again. Brought my parents, and they loved it. Location is great; nestled in the heart of downtown Chandler.

I was skeptical at first when I came in and didn't see many vegan options. I only had one item to choose from on the dinner menu--a sweet potato curry soup. Fortunately, it was delicious. My soy raspberry vanilla iced latte was superb. They had one vegan baked good--a maple doughnut--which was nice. At least they have a few options out there. But the real treat was the bar. The bartender was friendly, well-informed, extremely knowledgeable about the alcohol on hand, and open to whatever creative drink you could throw his way. I got a balsamic bloody mary and it was divine. All you had to do was give him some ideas and he took them and ran. Would definitely consider stopping in here on a night out, especially if all the bartenders are that good.

Three strikes, you're out.  The first time I came here, in early summer of 2015, I asked for a basic cleaning, the thing that's covered by your insurance. Sure enough, once they had me in the chair with my mouth cranked open, they informed me that because I hadn't seen a dentist in over a year, they had to do some super deluxe cleaning that would cost me over $100 out of pocket. I said I wasn't willing to do that, and after fighting me for literally 30 minutes and saying it was the only option, I got up to leave. Only then did they say, "fine, we'll do the basic cleaning." Then, upon check out, they insisted I have to pay for the super deluxe cleaning that I just got. It took another 10 minutes to get the receptionist to figure out they'd just done the basic cleaning.  To avoid this fiasco again, I made an appointment for exactly 6 months later, in December 2015. That way, they couldn't get me with the super deluxe cleaning scam. Just to be extra safe, I told them upon arrival that I would do nothing but the basic cleaning, so they could just get any other ideas out of their heads right now. Sure enough, once I was back in that god-forsaken chair, they insisted on upselling me again. They said they were legally obligated to do a more severe cleaning if your gums were at a certain measurement.  Side note, I've talked to multiple **reputable** dentists since and have been informed that's total BS. Also, I'd like to point out that I have pretty darn good teeth. I don't floss often, but I've never had a cavity, and my teeth have no discoloration or chips. So it's not like I've got some mouth full of janked up teeth over here.  Anyway, I didn't mess around this time, just got up to leave, and again, they were all, "No, please don't go, we'll just do the basic cleaning." This time, I got a bill months later from my insurance for the super deluxe cleaning I never had.  You're probably wondering at this point, why did this even get the chance to get to a third strike?  Anyway, I'm forgiving, so I figured I'd give this place one last chance, as it's close to home and it's hard to find in-network providers in my area. So back in December, I made an appointment for 9 AM today. I get there 15 minutes early, and by 9 AM, there are already like 8 people in the office waiting, even though they open at 9. I hear them frantically conversing behind the desk, and as 9:15 approaches, they have taken three other people back, even though I supposedly had the first appointment of the day. When I went to the desk to inquire, a severely stressed looking dentist advised that her two assistants and one hygienist hadn't shown up. When I asked why the one hygienist they had had taken someone else back first, they said they forgot to schedule me in her appointments. When I advised I thought I had the first appointment of the day, they said all these people were scheduled for 9 AM. What?? They adivsed they had no idea when they would be able to see me. That was enough for me. I declined to reschedule and will never return. I hope you will spare yourself the misery and avoud coming in the first place.  TL;DR: These people are scam artists, and they WILL try to bully you into getting more advanced services than you asked for. They will lie about the legality of things, then change their story when you try to leave. If their staff doesn't even want to show up there, why should I?

I didn't expect much when I walked into this little hole-in-the-wall in a less than enticing strip mall. But how wrong I was. I had the red curry with tofu and it was absolutely phenomenal. The tofu was fried to perfection, not over done. The red curry was creamy, delicious, and perfectly spiced. My boyfriend's Thai basil tofu was equally delicious. The food came out fast and the prices were reasonable. I will definitely be coming back to try more dishes. Green curry next!

Bruschetta was excellent! Very good wine selection. Nice atmosphere, and not so loud that you cannot hear your company. Waitstaff is attentive and well-versed in their product. Good music, my boyfriend and I had fun playing name the artisit. No complaints!

The pump would not let me use my credit card. It kept telling me to see the cashier. No one wants to deal with that when they are trying to get gas in a hurry. Then when I gave up and decided to use my debit card, the whole menu screen froze, so I had to use a different pump. Only upside is that the gas pumps gas fast here. Which is a weird thing to say, but some gas just pumps so slow.

Food is wonderful, but portions are small. Several alcohols we asked for weren't in stock, but the 1 cent lemoncello Yelp deal almost made up for it. I like the atmosphere, but they need a better tended bar. First time I was here our bartender was Dominic and he was awesome. Service is decent sitting at a table. Mostly just wish portions were bigger, as we were still hungry when we left.

I kind of wonder what people expect when they go to a buffet. 5 star restaurant quality food? Get real. I have been coming to this buffet for about a year now and have been about 6 or 7 times, I'd say. Always at lunch, as my work is nearby. I've never once been disappointed. The food is always hot (almost too hot, I always burn my mouth on the miso soup), and it's surprisingly fresh for the time I come (between 2 and 3 PM). I mean come on people, first rule of buffets: don't expect fresh food if you show up at off-peak hours. But even then, this place does okay. As a pescetarian, they have lots of fish and veggie options to choose from. And yes, I eat all the weird fish dishes they offer, and no, I've never gotten sick. It's a buffet; the food is not extraordinary. You'd be foolish to expect it to be. But it's perfectly decent. This place is clean, quiet, and undoubtedly meets expectations. Service is typically prompt and attentive, and prices are low. No complaints from me.

The first time I came here, I was between 3 and 4 stars. The servers seemed a bit uncertain, and they were out of the agedashi tofu that I had so looked forward to trying. I asked for the vegetarian ramen, which is not on the menu, but I had been advised on the Facebook page would be an option. My server advised that they did not have vegetarian ramen. However, right as I was about to leave, the owner came out and apologized and stated he was, indeed, able to make vegetarian ramen. So of course, I stayed. The ramen was phenomenal. Jay, the owner, is exceptionally nice, and he remembered me the second time I came in. By my third time, they all knew right away I would be getting the vegetarian ramen. Oh, and I got the agedashi tofu the second time I was there and it was great. Jay always comes by to chat. This is a very new place, so clearly they have some kinks to work out, but the food is just incredibly top notch. Some places offer vegetarian ramen that is just weird. Or creamy, I don't like that. But this veg ramen is just spot on. The broth is so delicious. And the noodles they make in house are just divine. If you are looking for curly noodles, you won't find them here, but it doesn't make them any less fantastic. I will be coming here at least once a week while I still live in the area. It's so nice for the east valley to finally have a ramen house!
