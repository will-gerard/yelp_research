Baby Kays and Pappadeaux's are the only real Cajun restaurants in the valley. All else I've tried including Cajun Seafood Corner, Voodoo Daddy's, and Ches Moneaux are posers only. They only WISH they served the quality Cajun cuisine that these restaurants serve day in and day out. My favorite item on the menu for Baby Kay's is the crawfish ettouffee. I've also had the red beans and rice. It is VERY GOOD. Couple the food with live entertainment on the weekend and you've got a recipe for a Cajun good time! Laissez Les Bon Temps Roullette!

I just took my wife and daughter to Mimi's. If you like REAL New England clam chowder then look no further than this place. They only serve it (sniff) on Fridays. It is rich, creamy, and full of big chunks of fresh clams. Couple that with a full menu of great lunchtime or dinnertime treats and you'll come away satisfied. The service was impeccable. The staff was very friendly and they work together as a real team to give their patrons a truly memorable experience. Love it love it love it! The muffins are great and when they found out my daughter hadn't been there before they gave her four muffins to take home with her absolutely gratis. I had the Cobb salad which never disappoints. My wife ordered off the two course special menu and got asparagus with citrus shrimp. My daughter had the salmon. Everyone raved about how good everything was. The food, the service, and the ambience is great. Two thumbs up...way up!

The wife and I went last night to this restaurant and to our amazement were seated immediately (never a good sign.) We immediately noticed how HOT the place was and we asked the waitress about it. She told us and I quote: "We can't lower the A/C to anything below 79 or it freezes up." Well let me tell you it was every bit of at least 95 degrees in there. After a few tentative looks from the wife we decided to get up and go to the OTHER Joe's on Baseline. It was much much cooler there and we had a great time. We love the crab pots and the salmon sunrise. We hate the heat and won't be coming back to the location on Southern unless they fix the A/C.

We love the feel and the food of a genuine 50's diner. My wife and I went to this one last night. It was just okay. Not even quite okay but just BLAH. I ordered the sliders. Here's my opinion folks for what it is worth: Whenever I have ordered sliders ANYWHERE in the country the sliders have always come THREE to an order. This one was only two small burgers with a mountain of fries to compensate. The fries were good don't get me wrong. The sliders were okay. There was only meat and cheese on them. The onions and tomato were on the side and they were raw instead of cooked onions. Traditional sliders come with chopped grilled onions on them. Also my wife ordered a chocolate malt. It wasn't malty. It tasted more like a chocolate sunday instead of a malt. Service was just okay. We had to wait an inordinate amount of time to be served and also for our check to get out of there. Biggest complaint: It was WAY HOT in there and we had to ask to have them turn on the A/C. They turned on the ceiling fans without the A/C and we were still uncomfortable but it was somewhat bearable. I would strongly recommend that if you want the look and feel of a genuine 50's diner with food and service to match that you go elsewhere.

Okay here's a little tip:  If you like blowing in and out of a hair salon with a buzz cut then don't bother...HOWEVER, if you like someone who is attentive to detail, meticulous, and thorough about your haircut then go see Veronica at this specific Fantastic Sams.  She really takes her time to do the job right and she's a wonderful person. I won't let anyone else cut my hair. She is a very sweet lady and she always gives me a Fantastic (excuse the pun) haircut.

Sad to say this shop fired my gal Veronica. I was disappointed but decided to try someone else there. The new girl was obviously high on something, incoherent, and did a lousy job on my hair. I won't be back. Stay away from these folks. They don't care about their employees and they don't care about their customers. I wondered why I always saw new people that I didn't recognize when I came to this shop. Now I know why. The management/ownership are cut throats that don't care about their employees. I'm taking my business elsewhere. Veronica if you're out there email me at dougshields1@cox.net and let me know where you're working now. Thanks!

Hey guys!  As many of you know my palate runs from the somewhat eclectic to the totally bizarre and all points in between. Whether it is crawfish, frog legs, or snails I never hesitate to "give it a try". Andrew Zimmer watch out! That is why I am giving Food City of Chandler my top pick for one of my favorite breakfast foods in the whole world.  "What might that be?" you ask. MENUDO! Hot, spicy, brothy, flavorful, salty, and yummy morning menudo. I'm a Scotch/Irish American and I believe my love for menudo comes from my ancestor's love for the traditional Scottish fare known as haggis. Sheep's stomach is not much different than cow stomach and tripe is the main ingredient in menudo. As a result I've been a menudo lover for several years since trying it for the first time in 2004 and guys this is the best menudo that I have found ANYWHERE in the world. I've had it in Cancun, I've had it in Mexico City, I've had it in Phoenix but ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, if you want the REAL DEAL then look no further than Food City in Chandler on the northeast corner of Ray Rd. and Arizona Ave. If you have a hangover I STRONGLY recommend this place as the one stop cure for what ails you. Spicy and delicious and steaming hot this amazing elixir is served up only on Saturdays and Sundays which makes the wait that much more meaningful. Their menudo is also served with the traditional limes and chopped onion / cilantro garnish and is recommended highly by "your's truly". Also if you like traditional marinated Carne Asada then look no further than the Carniceria at Food City (that means butchery by the way!) Take this home and put it on your grill and you'll be having a party when you taste this amazing marinated skirt steak. I have to commend the manager of this Food City. He's always around and smiling when he sees you. The staff is always friendly and happy to be of service. I LOVE my Food City. Don't ever change guys!

My wife and I started having problems with our AC just recently. We found Mike and his company on Yelp and we called him. It was on a Saturday and we were really worried that we wouldn't get anyone to call us back until Monday. Mike answered and said he would be out in an hour. SCORE!  He showed up (I was at work) and he was very helpful and immediately went about fixing our problem. The unit was low on freon and he recharged it, cleaned the compressor and a few other things and charged us just over $200.00 with the freon included in the price.  About three or four days later the A/C started doing the same thing (not blowing cold) and we called him. He came right back out, checked out the system, we think he recharged it again (not sure) and he thanked us and left. No he didn't charge for coming back and our A/C is blowing cold as I write this three weeks later.   Awesome company. We highly recommend Mike and his staff. Oh and we even got a phone call from one of his team members to check on our satisfaction.   How is THAT for great customer service?   Five stars Mike! You earned them!

I like Greek food almost as much as Italian food. I get very emotional about a great gyro or mousaka. It had been awhile since we tried this restaurant and we decided to give it another swing. Surprisingly we were greeted when we came in the door by the staff and the management. We were seated immediately (used to be you paid first at the register and then you sat down wherever you could find a seat). Our drinks were brought out to our table and we were then allowed to hit the buffet bar. This buffet had about twenty items on it. The gyro meat was fresh and good. The pita bread was awesome. The hummus was delicate and very good. By far the brightest stars on the bar were the cabbage rolls. The wife and I couldn't get enough of them. The service was excellent. The food was phenomenal. The ambiance was very good considering this is a strip mall location. If you love Greek food but don't want to break the bank then this place is a very good choice! I give it five stars and two thumbs up.The buffet by the way, is only on Friday through Sunday at lunch. The rest of the week it is menu driven. They also have a breakfast buffet but haven't tried it yet.

I have dealt with other car dealers.  Unfortunately I have not had the level of professionalism that I received tonight from Chris Davis at Big Two Toyota in Chandler. The dealership was immaculate. Everyone was friendly. There were no "high pressure" tactics like other dealerships and I got a FANTASTIC deal!  I just checked Edmunds and I purchased my car for less than Edmunds said I should have paid for it! If you want a sure enough great deal on a Toyota or a Scion don't look any further than Chris Davis (480)287-3191 Cell at Big Two Toyota Scion in Chandler, AZ. I tried my best to purchase a Ford Fusion and buy American.  I went to San Tan Ford in Chandler first and those guys were pushy, manipulative, and just plain "Salesy" in their approach. They never would give me a straight answer and they kept trying to "close me on payment". I was insulted and decided I would pursue the Prius from Toyota instead. I got a great car and a great deal and you should too! Again go see Chris Davis at Big Two Toyota Scion Internet Fleet Department and he'll take care of you. I'll go back again when my wife needs a car! I gave them five stars because that's all Yelp has. The finance department was great and we were in and out of the dealership in less than two hours start to finish! I got 48 months interest free financing on my car! WOOHOO!

I love mocha cappuccino frozen (blended) with a little whip on top. I get it everywhere I go. Starbucks' Frappuccino USED to be my best bet for a consistently great mocha but after sampling this place I have to say that I've had to change my mind. The service was excellent! These ladies really have it right and they always have a smile for me when I come in. They even had me try some samples last time I came through. I love the personal service and I really love the best blended Mocha Cappuccino that I've ever had. It isn't too sweet and it isn't too "coffee". They drizzle Ghiradelli's real chocolate all over it. It is perfect. Watch out Starbucks!  These ladies have got you beat on service, price and taste! Oh and they "speak Starbucks" so you can order what you would normally order at Starbucks and they'll make it for you no questions asked.

Went in today to get lunch at this place. I walked in and stood there waiting to be acknowledged...not happening. There were several employees that saw me and didn't even acknowledge me. I stood there for approximately two minutes waiting and I turned around and left. No smile, no welcome to Philly's Famous just a blank stare and a conscious avoidance. I won't be back.

I am usually not big on chain restaurants. However I can't help but give the local Outback at Chandler Blvd. and the 101 five stars! The wife and I dined there last night with some friends and here is how it went:  1. The doors were held open by two waitresses. 2. We were greeted with smiles from both of them welcoming us and we were also greeted with a smile and a welcome by the hostess.  3. Expecting a wait I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated immediately.  4. We were immediately greeted by our waitress with a smile and a welcome. She was prompt, helpful, and you could just tell that she was there to make our experience a great one!  5. Our friends got some cheese fries which looked awesome but I couldn't eat them because of my diet (low carb). I was laughing when I pointed out that they just HAD to put bacon on those fries. The waitress smiled and left and came back with a bowl of bacon ON THE HOUSE for yours truly! 6. When my steak came out it was cooked to perfection.  7. My drink glass was never empty the entire time.  8. I was asked if I wanted a box for what I couldn't eat.  9. Oh and the manager came by to check on us with a smile. She also asked if we needed anything and when my buddy said he would like some more iced tea instead of sending the waitress back to do that she got it herself!  10. When we left we were again thanked for coming and the doors held open for us BY THE MANAGER!   I have to say that I have never received this high level of service from any restaurant anywhere.   BRAVO!   I give this restaurant and its staff and its management two thumbs up...way up!

What can I say? AWESOME PIZZA! Some of the best pizza in the entire valley can be found right here in Chandler. Quick tip:  They can be a little skimpy with the cheese so the wife and I always order the pizza with extra cheese and extra pepperoni. If you get it that way you will swoon with pizza ecstasy I guarantee it. Also the canole's are to die for! The only other pizza place that comes close to this is at Casanova Brothers in Gilbert.

Alright. The food is very good. I have to give this about an even heat with Grimaldis' Buono's and Casanova Bros with regard to food quality. The defining quality of any of these restaurants however, is S E R V I C E!  The first few times we came here the service was O K A Y. The last two times we went here the service S U C K E D OUT LOUD!   Here's my advice to the owner of this establishment:   TRAIN YOUR WAIT STAFF TO GREET YOUR DAMN CUSTOMERS WHEN THEY WALK IN YOUR DAMN DOOR! TRAIN YOUR STAFF TO HIT THE TABLE WITH DRINK GLASSES WITHIN ONE MINUTE OF THE CUSTOMERS SITTING DOWN...PERIOD!  My wife and I sat there for five minutes waiting for someone... ANYONE to make eye contact with us or acknowledge that we were even there. Everybody was just too busy to even look at us. We knew that THEY knew we were there because they made it obvious that they didn't want to make eye contact because that would have meant slowing down long enough to talk to us!   Finally, the waitress walked over to the couple in front of us that had just walked in and seated themselves not a minute before and gave them a plate of garlic knots and glasses. My wife and I were still sitting there with our mouths gaping open and that was when YOU LOST MY BUSINESS! We both got up and walked out and nobody even bothered to ask us why.   My wife and I have been coming here for months since finding the place. We spend thirty bucks every other week with you folks. That's $780.00 bucks per year you are going to miss out on because of your lousy service.   If you wanna find us we'll be at Casanova Bros. or Grimaldis. They are the only pizza establishments left in the East Valley that truly understand customer service!

My wife and I have frequented this familiar place for years and loved Ginny's excellent service and personality. She has, as several other posts have indicated, sold the restaurant to new owners and sadly they have changed and not for the better.   The menu was different. The plating of the food was poorly done. The portions have been scaled back and the prices have been scaled forward.   We just got back from our LAST VISIT to this place and I was horrified with the poor quality of the food, the service, and we were the only ones in the entire place for quite a while.   In retrospect, I'm not surprised since everyone that frequented Zorba's apparently already knows what we were terribly disappointed to find out.   I hate to have to write a poor review for a restaurant that we have loved for years. I'm fairly certain, judging by the lack of patronage as well as the poor excuse for Greek food, that this place will close down very soon.   Goodbye Ginny! We will miss your smile, your love, and your wonderful food.

Best Thai food I've found anywhere! The decor is nice. Don't let the strip mall 'esque appearance of the parking lot fool you. This is a family run restaurant and the owners are AWESOME! The mother came out and talked to us and the son did too. Oh and the FOOD!   We first had the Pork Satay and it was served with spicy relish and sweet savory peanut sauce. It was great. Then I ordered the drunken noodles with pork. It was almost too much food. It was great! My wife ordered the Pad Thai and loved it. My daughter ordered the Squid Salad and she said that it could have had more meat on it but tasted great. She tried my drunken noodles and she said that was what she would get next time.   The spice level choice is 1-5. I love super spicy and I ordered 3. It was too hot for me. Unless you are Cajun by birth or have some sort of taste bud deficiency don't go past a two for the spice level.   Quick tip: When you're done with dinner order the HOME MADE Coconut Ice Cream. You'll thank me. Just f'ing do it and trust me when I tell you it ROCKS!

Being from Louisiana / Mississippi I have a special spot in my heart (and stomach) for Cajun food. If you want truly authentic Cajun food then look no further than this restaurant off the I-17. Everything is great. No matter if you want broiled fish or fried seafood the taste is awesome and the price is good. The raw oysters are great. The crawfish platter is fanstastic. The crawfish bisque is to die for. The boudin is authentic and good served on a bed of white rice. The only other place in town for Cajun food is Baby Kay's. I'm posting a review of them as well.

East meets southwest Louisiana and it was a trainwreck!!!  I read another review on another website that gave this restaurant a glowing recommendation.  Nothing could be further off than that. I came in because I'm from southwest Louisiana and love good spicy crawfish.  What I got was a BIG disappointment. I ordered two pounds of this and when it came out I noticed that instead of being big (like the other review said) they were about the size of my pinky. Then the second disappointment:  I ordered them EXTRA SPICY and they tasted like they had been boiled in day old bathwater. Oh and the ownership is Vietnamese (NOT that I have a problem with Vietnamese...I just don't expect them to know how to cook Cajun and my concerns were validated by the poor excuse for Cajun food that they served!). I love Thai food and I love Vietnamese food...the fact remains that I came to eat Cajun and got slop instead.  I complained that the crawfish weren't spicy at all and the waiter just shrugged his shoulders.  $45.00 later my wife and I left and went to another restaurant to eat because the food we ate there wasn't enough to make up for an appetizer at a REAL restaurant. I was totally put off by this restaurant and will NOT fall for fake posts by obvious POSERS who know nothing about the restaurant or the food they serve. Don't make the mistake I made.  I am totally ticked that I wasted my time, my Saturday night, and my money on this poor excuse for a restaurant.  NEWSFLASH:  A day after eating here I got the worst case of FOOD POISONING that I ever had.  I am sure it was bad crawfish. Some of them tasted rotten. I almost had to go to the hospital and had to take two days off from work to recover!

The good: Restaurant was clean.  The bad: The sushi was just okay. Not great and didn't seem fresh at all.  The ugly: The management plays Eminem music (rap) over the loudspeaker and the songs are XXX rated with the "F" bomb flying every other word and the typically demeaning words about women. We complained about how offensive the music was and the manager simply shrugged his shoulders and stated: "The corporate office picks our music for us and we don't control it."   Well they may not be able to "change the channel" but mister we sure can! Sake Bombers is a much better restaurant and always has fresh sushi. My only regret is that we took a chance eating here on our Valentine's evening. Regrettable but not repeatable. We saw several families eating there and they were visibly offended by the poor taste in music that this establishment forces upon its patrons.   Follow my advice: Go eat at Sake Bombers and leave the Stale Sushi Sexist Rappers to fend for themselves!   Peace out!

ACK ACK ACK!  They should name this one McNasty's! So disgustingly filthy and it took us twenty minutes to get our food.   I posted a photograph on the page (third one to the right) so you can see what we saw there.   I won't get another Unhappy Meal here! Wish I could give it no stars.

What can I say? The pizza is the perfect New York style and these guys do it right. Also they put the P in Personal Service. That's not something you see much in this area. Most restaurants treat you like a number. Not these "goodfellas!" They take their pizza and their customers seriously. They make it a point to welcome you to the restaurant and most of the time they call their customers by name. That is a lost art and you gents have my admiration for pulling that off! There's a lot to be said for tradition and this is the way they did it back in the day and they did it right! My wife and I had our second trip to the place today and had the large pepperoni. It was cheesy and had plenty of fresh cut pepperoni on top. The dough was the traditional NY style that you can fold and eat on the go. The flavors made me think I was back home at Mario's Italian restaurant and really made me long for the good old days! The proprietors made darn sure we were happy with our meal and the service was excellent! Try this when you go: Just TRY and leave without the owners thanking you for coming in. You will NOT make it out without them at least thanking you and possibly shaking your hand. Also the walls are literally covered with autographed photos of all the greats from the entire cast of  "The Godfather" to the "RatPack". The atmosphere was nice and quiet and the A/C works great so you won't be uncomfortablet! If you want true New York style pizza and some of the best service in the valley then look no further than this little place (locally owned and operated by the way!) on Val Vista just south of Baseline. You'll thank me later.

The wife and I decided we were in the mood for home style Italian food. We had noticed the new restaurant in Gilbert and decided to try it. I was pleasantly surprised that the place was crowded so that was a very good sign to me. I ordered the veal parmigianne and my wife ordered the lasagne. The veal was spongy, chewy, the breading was bland and uneventful. The sauce had a unique flavor but not in a good way. The pasta wasn't al dente it was more like what you'd get at a fast food Italian restaurant like Fazole's. My wife said that her lasagne needed more seasoning and that it wasn't anything special. Our ticket without alchohol was approximately 44.00 with tip. When I pay that kind of money I expect to get something memorable. This was highly forgetable. Also one other thing: Toward the end of our meal one of the waiters came in from the other section and YELLED (I'm not kidding) over my head at another waiter. I was completely put off by the whole experience and won't be back. Thanks but no thanks.

I recently was contacted by the proprietors of Jimmy's of Chicago and here is the content of their response to my post. Fair and balanced reporting is what I'm all about so I'm giving them a voice. I have to say that their willingness to address the issue and ask for another chance at my business is admirable and we might just check them out again soon. I'll keep you all posted as to my experiences there. Here is their response in its entirety:  Dear Mr. Shields,  I am sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your dinner here at our restaurant.  I wish you would have shared your concerns with us while you were here as it is of utmost importance to us that all of our guests have a wonderful experience.  We recieve many compliments on our veal dishes and especially on the lasagna.  In fact, the lasagna is one of our best sellers.  Obviously, people have different tastes and perhaps the items you chose are not made in the fashion to which you are accustomed.  We would love you to give us another chance as I think your experience would be much different.  If you are willing to do so, please introduce yourself to either me (Kerry) or my wife (Zalena). We have many regulars who come several times a week and we hope that you and your wife might become one of those.  If not, thank you for your past patronage.    Sincerely,  Kerry and Zalena Kersting

ACK! ACK! ACK!   Located in "beautiful" downtown Mesa, AZ.  If you like shopping for year old stuff or worse then this is the place for you!   If you like the glorious smell of body odor, cheap disinfectant and soiled baby diapers then you've reached shopping nirvana!  If you don't mind rubbing shoulders with the homeless drug addicted "Occupy Walmart" types then you've found a home!  If you want quality food in a safe shopping environment where you don't have to hold your breath, check your wallet every five minutes or question the safety of some of the food they have for sale there then you need to shop elsewhere.   Customer appreciation is going on right now: Free set of teeth and a year's supply of deodorant or depends with every $100.00 purchase!   (Okay I'm just kidding.)  Nasty nasty nasty!   You were warned.  I've told my wife that if she ever takes me there again I'll just catch a cab home.

We've eaten here twice and both times we were absolutely delighted! The wait staff was excellent and the food was fantastic! I have only tried the burritos and these are HUGE! One burrito fills up the plate for just $9.95. The first time I tried the house special burrito with large chunks of juicy steak along with spicy jalapenos and onions with a zesty sauce. The second time I tried the carnitas burrito. It was AWESOME!   I recommend that you order sour cream as a side for your burrito and bear in mind that this is the traditional Mexican "crema" and not the kind of sour cream you and I get at the store. I have to say that the food was delicious both times and that the service was impeccable both times. My favorite so far is the carnitas burrito with green sauce. It is the traditional slow roasted pork with jalapenos, onions and other peppers. It is spicy! Try it! You'll thank me later.

Thanks but no thanks! I got my car washed by these monkeys this morning. My car came out just as dirty as it went in except that I was 25.00 poorer than I was before! The service writer was more interested in getting an upsell on the ticket than what I was requesting to be cleaned. I had to spend five minutes with a rag wiping my card down after the guy told me it was ready. Called in to the manager and he pretty much berated me for leaving but I had to get to work. I had wasted enough time trying to get a decent car wash from these guys. Stay away...far away!

I finally got an email response from Mike Grimes the General Manager for Classic Car Wash. His attitude in his response reflected the general attitude of everyone involved with my hapless patronage of this "wannabee" carwash facility. For clarity purposes I'm posting my initial email to them sent on Friday a.m. I didn't receive any response from anyone until 10:30 p.m. Saturday night:  My email to Classic on Friday 4/15 at 10:07 a.m.  To Whom It May Concern,  I got my car washed today at the 1555 W. Warner Rd. location. I have used them many times before and have never had any issue. Today was a different story.  When I brought my car in the service advisor, Dale Collins greeted me pleasantly and kept pushing me to upgrade from my Supreme Wash to a special they were doing. Being in sales I don't begrudge anyone trying to up-sell their services. However he paid no attention to my needs and seemed to be only concerned with his i.e. getting a bigger ticket. I asked him to address a spill in the middle console drink area of my car and he said he would take care of it. According to Alex, the manager, that wasn't even put on the ticket.   When my car was ready I walked around it briefly and to my shock and surprise, I saw places that were easily cleaned that had spots of trash still remaining. I drive a 2009 Prius and I keep it pretty clean. Long story short I had to grab a rag myself and clean off some of the more noticeable areas of my car.   I paid $24.99 to have you guys clean my car. This was literally the worst car wash I have ever experienced. If I wanted to clean it myself I would have.   I have attached some photos of the areas that your people missed on my car.   I called in to the store after leaving and spoke to Alex. He lamented the fact that I didn't get a manager while I was there. I told him I had to go to work and was rushed. He did indicate a willingness to address the problems if I were to bring the car back to them.   I don't know what quality controls you have in place for your store but whatever they are, they are simply not working. My time is extremely valuable. I paid good money to get my car clean THE FIRST TIME. I don't have time or energy to try to "get it right" working with lackadaisical service.   I thought you'd like to know of my extreme displeasure working with your store there on W. Warner Rd. This is the first time I've had a problem with your store and will more than likely be the last time.  My Car# was 108 and I got that done this a.m. 4/15/11. Sale # 52385024003  You can call me at the number in my signature line if you'd like to discuss my issue.   Respectfully,  Doug Shields ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The following was Mike Grime's response to my email sent Saturday at 10:53 p.m.:  Hi Doug,   my name is Mike Grimes and I am the general manager for Classic Car Spa. I read your email and my typical response would be as follows. I apologize for not meeting your expectations with your wash today. We strive to meet and exceed our customer expectations on a daily basis. Our customers satisfaction is obviously our top priority. I spoke to Alex at the site. He assured me that he apologized to you and offered to rewash the vehicle for you at any time you desire and remove the road tar from your vehicle that is not included in any wash we offer. However, since you took your obviously valuable time to insult my employees on yelp.com by calling them monkeys, I will simply say that you are not welcome at any of my locations at any time. I have flagged your license plate number in our  system for any associate of mine to contact me if you show up on any of our properties. Find another hard working car wash crew to insult. If you desire to speak to me by phone please contact the corporate office and I assure you I will return your call immediately.   Sincerely,  Mike Grimes -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Obviously these folks have some serious issues and besides shoddy and mediocre work, a bad attitude is the main one. As any leadership or business class will teach the quality of the service of a company comes from the top down. In this case I can see why the customer wasn't served judging from the manager's response. As an aside I will say that road tar wasn't an issue on my car as he tried to indicate. It was simply dirt that they neglected to wash off of my car. I will also say that I was NOT told that I could bring my car back anytime. Alex tried to get me to bring my car immediately back in and when I couldn't he asked me what time I got off work. He never told me that I could bring my car back in "ANYTIME" and get a free wash. If he HAD told me that then none of this would have been posted to begin with and Classic might have kept me as a customer.  I don't need to say anymore here folks. You were warned.

"Premium" car wash at Classic Car Spa and having to clean your car yourself afterwards because they did such a sorry job: $24.99.  Getting your car washed at a church fundraiser later by kids with soap and a bucket and getting a better job done in the process: $10.00.  Complaining about the bad service of Classic Car Spa to the point that the manager bans you from ever setting foot on his premises: Priceless!

My wife and I are always trying to test out new restaurants and one thing that the East Valley has a shortage of is Chinese buffets. If you can handle visiting the older area of Chandler in front of Walmart then you just might find that you'll LOVE Zen Buffet. They are always friendly. We've eaten there five or six times since they opened. I'm always impressed and have never been disappointed. The service is great, the food is fresh and the crablegs are excellent. Shrimp, scallops, crab, crablegs and salmon round out what is already a perfect combination. We love Zen Buffet and will continue to frequent that place. I rate it much better than Pacific Seafood on Arizona Avenue. For some reason their restaurant always smells "fishy" and their prices are higher. If you want an excellent value without the "fishy" smell go to Zen Buffet. These folks know how to do it right!

This place was a huge disappointment.   My wife and I stopped in to order two chocolate sundaes. The guy at the register didn't crack a smile and was quite short with us.   He prepared our sundaes under the watchful eye of the owner. Both sundaes were well below the level of the already small cups and when he put the tops on the sundaes it looked ridiculous. The size of the portions (almost no whipped cream and very little chocolate) was laughable and you could tell the owner was taking full advantage of the smaller portions to garner a larger profit on the sale of these "Tastee Freezes".   This wasn't enough abuse though. While we were sitting there you could hear shouting in a foreign language in the kitchen area (not Spanish or English) and loud jabbering in some foreign dialect from the far east.   Bottom line: We spent $2.89 per sundae and got about seven bites of ice cream for our trouble.   We won't be back!

Great food. Great service. The place is very clean. The price is right too. Four of us ate the buffet and we got out for $36.00! What can I say...this place is the BOMB! Try it. You'll thank me later!

Not impressed at all. I spent $15.95 for the Carnitas plate. I'm a Carnitas fan and I order it whenever I try a new Mexican restaurant.  What I got was a mound of onions with pork scattered through it (and very sparsely I might add).  The best carnitas I've had to date was at two different restaurants in Goodyear: Raul & Theresa's and Manuel's. Both were quite good with Raul & Theresa's winning the gold.  The service at Arriba was decent. The decor decent. However I was extremely disappointed in the pricing and the skimpiness of their kitchen. When I order food I want FOOD. I don't want onions in my carnitas (actually it was a little carnitas in my onions).  Hey if you're an ONION fan and you want to pay $15.95 a plate for them then be my guest. However if you are a CARNITAS fan don't bother with this place.

Don't go here unless you want your identity stolen! Only do business with these folks if you're paying cash and don't mind a crappy car wash!  They were recently raided by federal agents and several employees as well as managers were arrested for identity theft.  The Arizona Republic article is shown below.  http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20130817arizona-dannys-car-wash-ice-immigration-raids-phoenix-brk.html  If I could have chosen negative stars I would have done about a minus two and that is being kind.   I took my car there on a Saturday morning at 7:30 when they opened. I was just going to do the regular wash but the salesman talked me into the $150.00 "detail" with the following promised:  Clay Bar Wax Job (Hand Wax)  Lenses Buffed  Interior Detailed  Shampoo Carpets  Remove Bumper Sticker  Three hours later I called to check on the car. They said they would call me back. They never did. I then arrived to pick up my car (already late for another appointment). It was parked at the pickup area so they were already "done" with my car. Sadly, the only thing that WAS done on the car was the interior detail. Even the carpets were left unshampooed!   No wax job. Bumper sticker still there. Lenses still unbuffed. I was unhappy and told the salesman there of my displeasure. He ran around trying to find his manager. Long story short I had to leave with the understanding that I would come back when I have more time for them to do the job they should have done in the first place!  After leaving I realized that the carpets hadn't been shampooed either. I checked online about this company and guess what I found out?  THEY HAVE AN "F" RATING WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU!   Their customer service in my case absolutely sucked out loud. I contacted the store wanting a full refund of my money. They said the manager was out. I came by the store and they called out the managers David and Jack Edlund. They crawled all over my car trying to find proof of the wax job. They couldn't. Then they offered to give me half of my money back. I refused and they walked away from me.   I then filled out the online complaint form for Danny's corporate office. Danny Handon is the owner of the corporation. They never returned my complaint even though it said clearly on the site: "For Fastest Response Please Fill Out The Form Below". What a joke! Five days later I contacted Corey at the corporate office (he wouldn't give me his last name) by phone and here is what I was told:  "All complaints are handled by the local management for the specific location and not by the corporate office."   I asked him what happens when I can't get satisfaction from the local manager. He said that was all he could do for me.   This company wasted my time and my money and is clearly not interested at all in taking care of their customers when they have issues.   STAY AWAY FROM ANY DANNYS CAR WASH LOCATION UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET A SUBSTANDARD WASH WHILE PAYING THROUGH THE NOSE!  I'll be contacting the consumer protection agency with the state DA's office to file a full complaint. I'm also contacting the BBB to file the same.  I gave them three opportunities to make this right and they blew me off each time.   I sincerely hope that this rating saves you time, money and aggravation! I only wish I had checked them out thoroughly before doing business with them.

The food was MARVELOUS! The atmosphere was quiet, casual and very clean.   The garlic shrimp is awesome and they were huge shrimp, almost prawns! The rice was excellent and cooked perfectly unlike other buffets.They are also the only Chinese buffet that I've found in Arizona that understands that crabmeat cream cheese wontons don't come with sugar or honey in them. The cleanliness of the place and the freshness of the food really impressed me. Also the price is very fair at 8.99 for an all you can eat lunch buffet with a variety of seafood as well as excellent choices for other entrees. I've tried other Chinese buffets in the valley that cost significantly more and this one is the clear winner for price, cleanliness, and fresh tasty food.   Thanks!  Doug Shields

The wife and I hit this place on a lark. We were at the Chandler Fashion Mall and saw that a new restaurant had opened up near the food court. When we got seated we noticed that the music was great. 70's music hits me right where I live and it was just the right volume. The staff was friendly and helpful. Things were going so well and then the train went off the tracks:  We ordered four tacos two for each of us. 45 minutes later we got our tacos. We were told that the kitchen was backed up with orders but this was around 1:00 in the afternoon and the place wasn't crowded at all. The tacos couldn't have been much larger than a silver dollar for $2.99 each. There were about three bites to each of these and there was more slaw than there was meat. They tasted okay but the size and the price really shocked me. We were also quite disappointed that our food was so late. We also noticed that many of the food items being served were kept on the counter for extended periods of time before being brought to the tables which might explain that our food wasn't exactly hot when we got it. (We were sitting at the bar so we got to observe the operation in great detail.)  I liked the people working there. Kind of an eclectic group if you know what I mean.   The open air feel to the bar gave it a true Baja feel. The music was fantastic. The people were nice. However the slowness of the food and the skimpy portions will ensure that the wife and I won't be coming back. When we walked out we saw a Rubio's around the corner from them. The tacos were the exact same price but have much more to offer in the way of actual quantity and even taste than Rock Taco.   If I were coming here to just hang out, drink and listen to music  I'd say it would be a good place to try. However if you're coming here expecting great food served in a timely manner I'd say try someplace else.

MEH! Not so yummy buffet.   The wife and I ate there tonight and we were terribly disappointed with the quality of the food. Much of it was stale, lukewarm (the warming tables aren't NEARLY hot enough!) and I was totally put off by the dark and somewhat unfriendly atmosphere.   I'll stay away from this place and spend my money elsewhere.

Great food. The concept was a little different i.e. standing in line to order and getting your food while you wait but it was pretty cool once we figured out what was going on. Everything is served ala carte so you just pick and choose what you want and they give it to you. They don't have plates. Just sheets of stiff paper that you eat from. That was a little different too. However the food was outstanding, the service impeccable, the atmosphere was fun and casual and our total bill for two out the door was a paltry $25.00! Oh and you don't have to tip because you do all the work!   We will definitely be back.

If you've seen my reviews on other companies you'll know that I don't hand out five stars easily. You have to earn that distinction and Jim and his team did just that.  I called Jim because:  a. I wanted to deal with a small local Arizona business versus "the man".   b. His Yelp reviews and other online reviews were impeccable.   When I called JPG I figured I'd be greeted by an answering machine or a call center. I was pleasantly surprised to get Jim, the owner. He was helpful, quick, and set up an appointment with us for Saturday.   So far so good...  Being very punctual, I set my iPhone alarm to tell me the day before that I had a Saturday 11:00 a.m. appointment.   Friday I received a phone call from Jim confirming my appointment. I happened to look down at my calendar alarm and it was going off as I was speaking to Jim.   Excellent...so far.  10:48 a.m. Saturday morning I heard the doorbell ring. Jim was early. (I like that.) Jim was friendly, informative, used state of the art equipment (including an iPad video) to educate and inform us as to what is important in a true state of the art alarm system.  Jim didn't sell us a contract. Instead, he helped us to understand the risks involved in purchasing a system that doesn't offer complete protection. He explained how thieves can easily disable "standard" alarm systems and the importance of having a completely independent system.   My wife and I opted for the top of the line monitoring system including voice, smoke, and glass breakage. It is completely independent of phone lines or electrical lines or internet (which can all be disabled  from the outside of the house.)  Since we opted for the top of the line "Cadillac" system, I expected to be shaken down for an up front payment (like the other companies I had called.) He didn't do that. In fact I didn't have to pay anything out of pocket up front. It was all included in the monthly monitoring.   Jim asked us when we'd like to have the system installed. I replied: "As soon as possible." He made a quick phone call and set up the system install for that evening. Jim thanked me for my business, shook my hand, and left.   Nice...  5:15 p.m. that afternoon the doorbell rang. The tech was there to do our install. He ran through the entire system with us and installed it and was gone within forty-five minutes.   The system is easy to understand and access even for my wife, who is a little less tech savvy than I am. If you can dial a cell phone, you can operate this system.  Wow!  My main take-a-ways from this experience:  a. Yelp ratings work. When you see consistently great ratings then you can rest assured that this company is doing the right thing by its customers.  b. Always look around. Don't just go with the "big guy" because he's big. Chances are there's a smaller company willing to go the extra mile for your business. Why do business with a "call center" in another country when you can do business directly with the owner IN ARIZONA?  c. Jim didn't use "salesy" tactics or intimidation. As a matter of fact he didn't try to sell me at all. He was informative, gave me several options to choose from, and made it easy for me to make a decision. He didn't pressure me and everything he promised me he and his team delivered!  Am I happy with my alarm system? Absolutely! I can't think of anything that Jim could have improved upon.   Job well done Jim!

Superb service. Great value. Wonderful sandwiches!   We bought the most expensive sandwich on the menu and my wife and I had to split it because it was so big. I think the whole dinner including drinks was like $12.00 or something.   We loved the food. The French bread is so good it reminded me of my time in Louisiana.   Everybody was friendly and helpful.   LOVE LOVE LOVE!

Great atmosphere with music from a bygone era!   The food was awesome with a wide selection of burgers (unique and mouthwatering!)   I had the Three Cheeseburger which boasts three (count 'em!) THREE slices of chess including provolone, cheddar and Swiss on a 1/3 lb. patty served with fries. My friend had the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich.  We were both very pleased with the friendliness of the staff as well as the owner. They all made us feel very welcome.   Would highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner and they have baked goods as well in the counter up front.   Will definitely be back!

When we entered this place we could smell a stench like sewage backing up. However we pressed on. It was hot and we needed something to cool us down.   My wife and I ordered two chocolate malts. The lady pulled out two cups from a freezer that had frozen ice cream in them and popped them in the microwave. (A little odd if you ask me. Not exactly "hand scooped and hand made" as the ads would indicate.)  Then when she had thawed the ice cream enough she pulled them out of the microwave and mixed the chocolate and the malt into them.   When she served them they were way below the cup line. Looked like almost half of the product that was supposed to be in them. My wife and I asked about it and the girl said: "We can't put more than eight ounces in the cup."   We shrugged and took the malts and sat down.   About halfway through my malt I decided to go to the Carl's Jr. website to see the actual serving size.   14.6 ounces and NOT 8 ounces.   I asked for the manager. She confirmed that the product size was only eight ounces. I then showed her on the Carl's Jr. site that the serving size was SUPPOSED to be 14.6 ounces. She shrugged and said that was what the owner told them to do and I asked for his name. She wouldn't give it to me.   I informed her that they were ripping off their customers and that we would let Carl's Jr. corporate office know about it.  I've eaten at other Carl's Jr. locations with no problems but this particular store on Jewel should be avoided like the plague!
