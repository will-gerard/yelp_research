Food is good, isn't an issue. But service is. I gave two stars because the service was horrible. Our server was disconnected & cold. They hardly asked how we were doing & it felt like we had to catch their attention  to order or ask a question.  Sushi is about having a good time.

I have been coming here since it opened at the age of 13. Coming from a family from the east coast... Bagels are important. These are NYC bagel quality! I still come here now that I'm 22. Still the same quality since their opening day.

Only Chinese place I go to when I'm missing my NYC take out. They are very friendly and delivery service is quick and quality. Good food, and great tasting.

Hands down best taco joint in Gilbert Heritage Square. Fish tacos.. On point. Shrimp tacos... On point. Lobster Tacos.. On point. Even their fish & chips & clam chowder is too die for. Honestly if I'm in the mood for seafood or tacos I alwaysssss go to SoCal. Their food lives up to the SoCal beach food crowd.

Awesome plant boutique in phoenix. Eclectic & quirky to spice up the nursery crowd. Great prices and the owners are very informed about each of their plants to send you home knowing how to care for it. Definitely check it out! Could make a great gift!

Went on a Saturday night and while my ice cream tasted great... The service was mediocre. When we walked in no one welcomed us or offered us help. We stared blankly for 5 min before the employees turned around from their conversation to ask if we needed help.
