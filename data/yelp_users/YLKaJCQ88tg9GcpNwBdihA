This place has an obvious identity crisis.   They ARE an authentic Szechuan Chinese restaurant BUT have to serve Americanized Chinese food on the side. They make it awkwardly obvious they are not proud of that separating the menu between "Authentic" and "Americanized". It's like the 1970s and 80s all over again! I guess Phoenix doesn't have enough customers to appreciate Szechuan cuisine at it's finest.   Food:  Me: Mapo tofu  Lady: American or Chinese style?  Me: .....?? *In my head* I'm freakin Chinese give me the Chinese one!   Mapo Tofu - I should have order the American one...what she was really asking is Cantonese or Szechuan. Cantonese is sweeter with a semi thick sauce. Szechuan version is soaked in hot oil which did not set well for my stomach and it is the knumbing version which makes you feel like crap if you're not use to it.   Sizzling rice soup - MSG soup with snow peas, baby corn, chicken and shrimp. Ok ok I should expect a dish like this to such, but my American side was craving this...don't judge me!   Service:  Limited English staff. Chinese attitude. I Love it! But not after a long day at work.   Environment:  It actually looks pretty nice in here. About 60% of their patrons are actually Chinese with limited English.   Price:  Wasn't expensive for the type of food served. Americanized menu is much cheaper.   I would give this place another shot if I lived in the area.  Food: 2 Service: 2 Environment: 4 Price: 3

Maybe I come from an area with a lot of crappy 24s....but I thought this one was pretty nice. It was pretty big too...I was almost going to drive another 10 miles to a different one because of the 2.5 stars on Yelp.   2 fitness rooms for various courses. Not something I see much in California. This is a 2 story fitness center. Lower levels house the care center, pool and locker rooms and upstairs with the fitness rooms, weights, and cardio machinery. Plenty of parking outside. Unlike the California 24s I'm use to, they do not lock up the bodypump weights and even have jump ropes for your usage. Thumbs up!

You're new to this populated desert, left 24 hour fitness and have a huge urge to eat Mediterranean food....Yelp to the rescue!   I didn't really know what to expect from the place. It was 20 minutes before closing and the place is pretty much closing.   Food:  Ordered the Kabob combo to try a mixture of items.  Chicken kabob: Dry chicken because they use chicken breast but packed with flavor. I would suggest chicken thigh meat.  Kofta - Not the best I've had, but no complaints either. Right soft bouncy texture with enough flavor.  Steak - The best one! Came medium rare. Soft and flavorful (same spices as the chicken kabob).  Hummus - Smooth texture.   Service:  They took my order and money with a smile. Not much service necessary at a place like this.   Environment:  Order in a grocery store type counter and pay for it in an actual grocery store counter. You can eat it in the grocery store if you want....awkward Asian guy sitting in the store....no thanks.   Price:  $11.50 for quite a bit of food. I thought it was fairly priced.   Food: 4 Service: 3 Environment: 3  Price: 4

I had a tear in why eye as I watched their donut conveyor fry a donut and crank it out to the bowl. Fresh friggin donuts!   I just got to town and my driver recommended me to come here for brunch. I skipped sleep (I took a red eye) and grubbed away.   Food: Brunch had amazing options, though it was pretty pricey...so one should expect the food to be good. They had an assortment of meats, veges, american comfort items and an omelette station.   Service:  Great server and friendly staff overall.   Environment:  This building is very grand. A must see. If you're not going to eat in here at least just walk in and take a stroll!  Price:  $30 after tax and tip is pretty pricey for a brunch.   Food: 5 Service: 5 Environment: 5 Price: 3

I found it odd how identicle Bandera is to Houston (which I ate at the day before). Then snap OH they are owned by the same people.   Food:  The best corn bread I have ever eaten in my life. And I don't even like corn bread (except from here). A Must try. I ate alone (yes very lonesome) so 1 order was way too much. Best to be shared amongst 3 other people but I tell you it is a MUST try.   Chicken/Ribs combo - Chicken was moist and very well spiced. Ribs tasted deep fried! Delicious. The bbq sauce on the ribs was sweeter than I am use to but left a fairly refreshing taste in my mouth.   Service:  This is Scottsdale...service better be good! And it was.   Environment:  Dampened environment. Great for first dates or lonely dinners on your own. I highly suggest sitting at the bar if you are eating alone.   Price:  Cheaper than I remembered, but you'll probably spend at least $30 a person eating here.   Food: 5 Service: 4 Environment: 4 Price: 4

I had high expectations stepping into the buffet line. It's the "Wynn buffet" you really can't expect any less right?   Food:  By far the most disappointing part of the meal. There is quite a bit of variety but not as much as the other big named buffets in Vegas. The food was surprisingly disappointing...I tried every fish dish they had to offer (totaling 5) and only enjoyed one of them. The crab legs were not fresh. The sushi was made incorrectly (rice was a mush texture). The lamb dishes were okay. The prime rib was decent but heck how can you really mess that up?    Service:  Well its a buffet so you wouldn't really expect much service. The waitress took quite a while to get us drinks. She was just not that friendly overall.  Environment:  This place looks like a $50 per head restaurant. And maybe that's why I expected much more than they provided. The design ranging from plating in the buffet line to table decor is probably the best I've seen at a buffet.   Price:  Expect to spend around $40 for dinner. My recommendation? Take that $40 and eat somewhere with solidly decent food. If not make a quick cab ride to the Rio buffet.   Food: 2 Service: 3 Environment: 4 Price: 2

I'm typically not picky about my hotels. Clean room, semi decent service will typically earn you 3-4 stars in itself. I'd like to say they were busy that week...but it's Phoenix....and pretty empty around if I say so myself...so NO you can't have that excuse.   1) I'm a frequent traveler and I tend to sign up for hotel chain reward memberships. I stick with Hyatt, Marriott and assumed I would sign with Raddison and stick with these 3 chains. They did not offer me the rewards card during check-in. The gal at the front desk seemed out of it noting it to be very busy....It's Sunday night...there's no one else here but me checking in....  2)  I get placed in perhaps the worst floor (2nd) with the worst room. I had no view out the window...I saw air conditioning units AND it made a hissing sound every 10 minutes which didn't bother me until I noticed it after the 2nd night. I asked for a room change - "Sorry no other rooms available"  3)  The business center looked great. I went in to try to do some studying but the chairs were so low compared to the table. No these are not the height adjustable chairs...  My less than satisfying visit here resulted in me booking at the Marriott for my next stay....

I found this restaurant listed on a top 100 Chinese restaurants in the USA list. Initially I thought well...that's just bs because the top 100 chinese restaurants in American should all be locate in San Francisco/Bay Area, Los Angeles/San Gabriel Valley and New York City. I figured I'm in the general Phoenix area and will need my Chinese food fix so why not give it a shot?   Food:  Hand pulled noodles! In Phoenix! I ordered the Ox-tail hand pulled noodles (wide noodles) in soup. Absolutely delicious. Very al dente texture. Soup and oxtail had good calm flavors.   Beef tendon - Sliced and soaked in a sweet vinegar sauce. Slices were a bit too big, but it was very well made.   Service: Very plain robotic service. Not bad. Nothing stood out of the ordinary.   Environment:  This placed is tucked to the right of Lee Lee market. Clientele is 50% Chinese which is impressive considering this is Arizona and Asians seem fairly rare.   Price:  Fairly well priced. Two dishes ended up being less than $14.   Food: 5 Service: 3 Environment: 4 Price: 5

I had no expectations walking into this place. All I know if this looked like an expensive burger joint so I'm ready to swamp an above average burger down my throat and wash it down with a shake.   Food:  We had a group of 15-16 people. We all literally ordered the same thing. The burger just didn't taste good...and it was overcooked. No I didn't ask for them to change my order and medium rare my piece of meat because I don't think that would have mattered.   Only exception to the food/drinks was the chips and dip they served.   Service:  Service was decent though the waitress appeared flustered to take our orders. You're in Vegas woman get use to it! J/k I'm really not a jerk, but seriously you're in Cosmopolitan and across from one of the hottest clubs in town. Work FASTER.   Environment:  Felt like an expensive burger joint in here. Need I say more?   Price:  Didn't pay...but I'm sure it was overpriced.   Food: 2 Service: 3 Environment: 4 Price: N/a but it I had to guess I'd give it a 3

This is one of the highest rated restaurants in the area. I didn't know what to expect here. I was in T-shirt and jeans which seemed a bit underdressed because people were in dress shirts and ladies in nice blouses.   Food:  I ordered Scallops and a beer.  Scallops - Cooked to perfection.   Service:  I sat by the bar and didn't really need much service. The bartenders were fairly attentive though dropping by every now and then to see if I wanted another beer.   Environment:  Great first date spot. Heck there were 3 couples in the bar area that seemed like it was their first date. Good food with loud vibes. Dress to impress type of restaurant.   Price:  $20 - $40 per head.   Food: 5 Service: 5 Environment: 5 Price: 3

It's hard to find good Asian food in this part of the country...so I didn't really have high hopes for this place. It was right next to my next work appointment which made it convenient enough. I got in there around 1 -2pm for a late lunch.   Food:  They were out of Pho =( I ordered what I typically order to test the skill of the chef. I ordered a Chow Fun. Chicken Chow Fun - It wasn't too greasy, didn't clump, and had a good balance of flavor. I approve. Not the best but definitely not bad.   Service:  Friendly staff. Owners work hands on as well. They seem to know half the customers walking in.   Environment:  Very pseudo Asian design in here...like the stuff you see on TV. I actually felt like I was sitting in an Asian porn set. Not that I know what an Asian porn set looks like....but...ok...nevermind...  Price:  Well priced for the type of food. Honestly if they raised their prices...people would still come because there is not much else nearby.   Food: 4 Service: 4 Environment: 2 Price: 4

It's hard to not compare a place like Blimpie to Subway because...well they serve the same thing. This was my first visit to a Blimpie and I was not at all impressed.   Food:  The sandwhich was not bad but it was not as good as a subway sandwich. Why can't I see what vegetables I want to add?? You have to ask me on every item? Gets annoying. It's hard to mess up a sandwich and in this situation they didn't.   Service:  The staff was friendly but there is only two customers in the store. I stood there for 10 minutes waiting to order while 1 guy was slicing meat and the other guy taking his time with the other customer. No bueno.   Environment:  This Blimpie is EMPTY.   Price:  Paid $9 for what looks to be smaller than a 6" sub with chips and a drink. Pretty pricey for what it is.   Food: 3 Service: 2 Environment: 2 Price: 2
