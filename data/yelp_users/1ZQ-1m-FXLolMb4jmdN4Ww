I usually go to tip and toes to get pampered with a manicure and pedicure however one day I was running a little late and I stopped at Paulenes on Hayden.  I was greeted and off to a good start, then all went downhill.  I was in the service industry for almost ten years so I always take good care of anyone recieving tips (just as a side note) I was helped by the main lady, who was on the phone the whole time, didn't finish my nail paint job (which was a complete mess I could have done a better job painting them) and walked away when one of her "regulars" came in.  I saw where her prioraties were and it was not to me! I had to ASK another lady help me finish my pedicure and when trying to pay I also encountered the main lady which took another ten minutes extra because she was avoiding me to pay attentin to the other regular! I never recieved a thank you or even an apology.  Needless to say I will NEVER set foot in there again and I advise you not to either!

I love this sushi spot!!!!  The fish is so fresh and you recieve decent portions for the price!  The only thing I would have negative to say is the service is lacking extremely!  You wait forever to get a drink even your bill. I reccommend sitting at the sushi bar at least you will get your sushi in time before the resturaunt closes!

I love the feel of this bright cheery resturaunt.  It has a casual sophistacated feel. I like the area it is in as well around all of the 7th Ave. Vintage shops that I adore.

I have always loved this place!!! It is in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale next to the Canal area.  If you are into wine this is the place to go!! They have a very extensive wine selection and the staff is well versed in helping your way through the large "binder" (it is actually not a binder it is nicer than that but for lack of other words it is easier to picture how big it is).  They are famous for their Stetson chop salad which can be served with salmon or chicken.  It is the best chop salad I have experienced in the valley.  Now lets move on to the scallop dish.... WOW!  It is very rich but I crave it!  It is served with beet risotto a dill cream sauce as well as a few other wonderful additions that complement the dish.  Also if you are looking for good carpaccio as in the meat not fish realm, here's the end to your search.  I am a true lover of beef carpaccio and here they have a separate delicacy; buffalo carpaccio!!!!!  I could go on but I suggest you check it out for yourself.

Not your typical flashy Scottsdale hang out....  Sounds good to me!  I like the old school interior it is kinda comforting in some sort of historic way.  The food however is to write home about!  For being in the middle of the desert their seafood in phenominal!  King crab and the mussles are my favorite!!! Happy dining!

I LOVE Thai Basil!!!! Staff is very friendly we are repeat customers and always recognize us.... I love that! I have tried almost everything on the menu and there is not ONE dish I do not like.  That never happens... EVER!!  The only issues I have with this establishment which are not communicated at all; the food comes out at seperate times, sometimes u r waiting while the rest of your table has their dinner, also the staff is really really really slow.  But that has not deterred me from the amazing food!!!!!!!!!!!

I am an avid sushi diner and used to work at a sushi place as well. Soooo I always like to check out different sushi spots and see how they compare.  I was so pleased. The selection of fish and seafood was by far one of the best specializing in more rare plates (usually more common to real sushi bars).  I had thier oysters,(amazing), giant clam which is not as scary as it sounds, monkfish live pate (very good not for the faint at heart), plus many other delicacies.  They were all good each in their own way.  We tried okamase (I hope I spelled that right) and the owner came over and introduced himself to us.  He told us that his resturaunt was all about bringing some of his favorite dishes to az that he enjoyed while growing up in Japan.  I have to say it was expensive but well worth the whole experience and I will be back!!!!

I have to start out by saying that I love the concept, design and of course the amazing gelato. I however am driven to write this review because I have experienced TWO separate unprofessional occasions within less than a week (four days to be exact). I went into the Camelback and 32nd St. location on Friday May 6th. I am in the restaurant business and I always give every bad experience a second try because everyone makes mistakes. Well........... I came in 15 min. before close- a big no no for industry ppl but I wasn't asking for a full 4 course meal especially because EVERYTHING was still out. I knew exactly what I wanted and of course tipped. The reason I was a bit upset was because I walked in to the two employees (one I found out later was a manager) mopping and cleaning and I was given the rudest look followed by an eye roll and a huge sigh by the manager. I was taken a bit back and I felt the need to apologize even though I was the customer they were STILL open. I offered to leave because I felt so uncomfortable. I was given service and was also given a half hearted explanation that he was very tired and it was the end of the night that was why he acted in that way. Ok fine I understand the way those nights are- believe me I have had them but still coming from a manager!!!??? What drove me to write this was my experience tonight Monday May 8th. I went to the Scottsdale location on Scottsdale Rd. just south of Camelback. I came in at 10:30PM an hour and a half before they closed. I was at the counter waiting for a long time. I was not acknowledged or even saw any employees until I moved toward the kitchen doors where I saw a very nice gentleman that finally saw that I had been waiting out there for a while. I was served and really didn't get any sort of meaningful reason of why I was waiting so long (by the SAME manager from the previous location!!!!) when there were three employees on and the business was not even the slightest busy. He gave me a very bad excuse to cover up for loitering around outside on the patio chatting instead of doing his job.  I proceeded to contact them afterward because the whole situation was very unprofessional with the two incidents and he tried to change his story about how he acted on Friday and that he may come off to some people to be rude because he is Italian and has a different sense of humor. WHAT!!!!!??????? I don't care who you are or what nationality there is a difference in cultural aspects and just being down right rude and a bad manager. I have several friends that are Italian like him straight from Italy who don't act like that. I felt that excuse was WAYYYY out of line and was just digging himself into an even bigger gaping hole. He made an excuse that was an embarrassment to his place of work and was derogatory to all other Italians. I would like to say I want to return but unless there is a change in management I will not step foot into that place unfortunately. In this case one bad apple spoils an amazing restaurant. However if I do not return I will still have dreams of the wonderful gelato! :)

My whole outlook on the horrible experience at the Gelato Spot changed by the immediate response by the owner. Not only did he apologize for the incident, but he offered me a gift certificate to use at his business.  This is the first time any business owner acted as professional as he did. I appreciated the amazing customer service that he offered and really made me feel like he really does care about his patrons. I will definitely return!

If you want the epitome of the Scottsdale/LA wannabe scene this is where you go.  This place is corporate as it gets down to the Ed Hardy wannabe Saddle Ranch shirts a lot of the servers sport... UHHHHHH!!!! How is that appealing in any way?  I was waited on by a very tragic girl as well, I believe her name was Rebecca.  She was pushy and rude.  I wanted to just check out the place and see what they had to offer and if I wasn't ordering what she wanted me to order she really didn't pay much attention to us!  i couldn't believe it!  She was telling us about different things on the menu such as steaks and drinks and was quoting things that she needed to do a little more research on. She really didn't know the big differences of some of the steaks how do you reccommend something and don't even know anything about it?

I like this place a lot, however I think it needs a little work.  I love that they have better quality items and more avalibility than Buffalo Exchange, but the artsy design on the inside is cool but kinda half assed.  Overall I really like the concept and am a huge advocate of small business, so I would reccommend it to a friend.

I love the concept- there is a little bit for every taste on the menu.  You can have breakfast or lunch whenever you want!  It is about time someone knows how to make a good biscuts and gravy!!!

American Apparel is one of my favorite stores.  It is a bit overpriced for what it really is but I love the feel and the fit of the clothes so much I keep going back!

What Poncheros is in AZ now!!!!!  How lucky could we get!!!!!  Poncheros is compared to Chipolte but just so everyone knows who has never tried it before.... It is a million times better.  They even freshly press EVERY tortilla from fresh dough each time you order.  I came to AZ and tried Chipolte because everyone raved about it, well when I walked in I immediately though of Poncheros and became very excited!  Unfortunately to my utter dissapointment is did not even come close to how good Poncheros is.  Sooooo I hope all you Chipolte lovers will give this new to AZ spot a chance, I guarantee you will not be dissappointed!

Best Chinese food in the valley. I have read some reviews and i am sad to say that they are not looking at the big picture.  This restaurant is very traditional.  The workers are all family. If you have ever dined at an ethnic restaurant you would understand. It is more about the food than anything else. Service follows. The food is so fresh and amazing it is worth drive. Please take the time to discover it yourself. I LOVE this place! If you expect Panda Express then you can forget it might as well go to McDonalds. Foodies in the area, this is a must!!!!
