What a huge disappointment this restaurant is. A restaurant that should be filled with good times and excellent food. The service was terrible. They were understaffed, at least if you consider that we had a party of about 20 with one (seemingly) inexperienced server was provided no help. It took our food about an hour and 15 minutes to come out after we sat down though we had kids and were ready and hoping to order from the moment we sat down. The food was decent. Perhaps the equivalent of Applebee's at prices that were about double that. Ties on the ceiling, great ambience, but way too much money with no excitement in service or food.

First time here. Did not disappoint. Great burger. Too often burger joints disappoint. My #1 combo lived up to the yelp reviews.   Very good fries. Friendly, fast service. Came at 1230, long line, had my food at the table within about 10 minutes of walking in. Don't let the lunch line scare you away. It almost sent me elsewhere. I would've missed out.

Kathy is amazing!  She has been helping our family with every type of alteration from boys' suits, men's suits, dress shirts, dresses (for my daughters and my wife) for years. And she has saved us last minute at times.   In all the years we have trusted her she is batting .1000.  Great personality, great customer service, and fantastic alterations.   If you are looking for someone that knows her stuff, start with Kathy's Alterations.

Wow!  What an amazing restaurant. We had a by group and had the chance to try a lot of fantastic food.  The tapas are the best.  The guacamole - as simple as that is - was better than you'll find at almost any restaurant around.  The fish tacos were fantastic.  The shrimp tacos were a different twist on the fish taco.  We will be back even though this is s long ride from home.  It's just worth it.

Stuck in a nondescript strip mall in Ahwatukee is one of the biggest surprises you will find. Are you from back East or the Midwest? Do you miss real bagels so much that when you visit home and the first thing you do is run out and buy a real bagel?  Well, the wait is over. Real bagels straight from the East are here!    No more bread rolls shaped like bagels. Try any of these and you will know that you are dealing with a pro. Kal, the owner, owns a bagel shop back in New Jersey. This place is worth the drive. The owner is awesome. Visit this place and you cannot go wrong.   And if you think that Einstein's brothers offers a real bagel come and check this place out and find out what you've been missing for all these years!

My awesome wife and I decided to try this place. She got the chicken Schwarma salad. I decided to get the Gyro plate.  I'll admit I was a little bit hesitant. I wasn't sure if I wanted to risk a bad meal at a small restaurant I had never heard of. No problems here! Both of us got great food.  The portion sizes were really good. My wife is very picky with the quality of chicken and she loved it. They even gave her a sample to make sure she liked it and they even have diet Dr. Pepper, her favorite.   The value was excellent. We will definitely be back.

The real deal.  Motown in the desert.  Missing coneys?  I had coney withdrawal for almost 20 years after moving out here. The Detroit Coney Grill opened.  I'm not going to lie - I was skeptical.  I've tried other imitations and they never came close. But David and his team at Detroit Coney nailed it.   And if you're with someone that doesn't appreciate awesome coneys?  No problem. Some of the best hamburgers (they grind their i.e.  Hamburger meat fresh, on-site according to the owner) and cheese steaks of any restaurant in town.

You will be impressed and surprised when you try the sushi here. I know I was. Yes, I followed the yelp reviewers who all had good things to say. And that's the reason I gave it a shot. But the people there were also incredibly friendly. The service was fantastic. And the sushi was better than most for less money than most places.   Not sure if I just got lucky or not but I also had a little appetizer that was a fun and different (and free) start and then had a desert with apples with some mango on top of it that was far better than that sounds. Great place all around. You've got to try this out!
