The guy that runs this place is outstanding! Always in a chipper mood and makes light conversation. I've only been here a few times and each time he and his staff have been very detailed about the services I need done and it's always ready when they say it will be. Reasonably priced. Great location near groceries, restaurant, bank, gym, etc.

Almond milk - FINALLY, a cafe that knows that they are doing! Always the best, friendliest service :) THE BEST chai in all the land. Great smoothies too.

I had been here for 5 min and already knew I would be back... The owner is a straight shooter with a ton of energy. Pictures of him with family, friends, customers, athletes, etc cover the walls and the tables. Open kitchen so you can see the chefs in action.

Prices are okay. Quality of food is great! Vibe is very Portland Hipster.

I would give it four stars for the slow service but the quality of the food far outweighs the wait time. It's husband and wife (I assume they're married) and sometimes the kids help too. Super nice people and a very warm environment.

If you are ordering for delivery, be prepared to wait... for 30-60 minutes!   I have ordered from here twice and both times, my wraps were soggy and no flavor! Soup was alright but could have used a lot more flavor.

The only things that I don't like about this place are the prices and the wait. Other than that its amazing!

I've been meaning to write a FIVE STAR review. Coming here for about a year. Customer service has NEVER been their strong suit, but the products themselves are always top quality, so I keep coming.  Starting with yesterday, I came in and ordered a shot in my latte and did not receive one. No big deal. I also ordered one of their delicious slices of bread and it turned out they gave me the wrong one... Unfortunately, I discovered all of this after I got back into my car, on my way to work... Well today I went in with the same orderand kindly let them know that there was no shot in my latte yesterday and the cashier kindly comp'd me for it (best customer service yet), while the barista (same from yesterday) gave me "the stink eye"! Surprised by his reaction, I forgot to say almond milk. So when the cashier told him, after he had already started making it with regular milk, he threw his head back and rolled his eyes!!!!! I could not believe it!! Unfortunately, this is what has finally prompted me to write my review.  I hope the hiring manager is able to read this and considers hiring a better staff. And then train them on proper customer service.

I'm only giving one star because zero stars isn't an option. I will NEVER use them for anything, ever! The guy in the store, ERIC, was nice but ordered the wrong item. They delivered the wrong refrigerator (but we bought the floor model, not even one that needs to be ordered) and they refused to deliver the correct one same day. They also refused to credit us our $85 delivery fee. Oh, but they will give us a $20 gift card! As if I will ever return again! SHAWN, a manager of some kind, did not handle the situation with any compassion whatsoever, nor did he handle it in a TIMELY manner.   I had to call over and over and each time he would give me the run-around and never called me back. TERRIBLE way of conducting business.

It's all about the BULK FOODS!!!!! I absolutely love this place. It is not close to my house at all but I will make the trip because I usually save at least $20.

I give 5 stars for a reason. Everything I've ever had at Rehab is like a party in my mouth.

FIVE star food... When it's prepared right and doesn't get you sick (like the shrimp for example). ONE star service because my order is ALWAYS - no joke - ALWAYS wrong, somehow.

Local, organic, fresh and gluten free. Great music, staff is always upbeat and super friendly. The menu is fairly limited but they always have new specialty dishes added to the chalkboard wall. The coffee is amazing (and I'm hard to impress) and I absolutely love that they offer non-dairy options. I come here quite often and every time I'm blown away!

Great service, great atmosphere, creative menu with worldly coffee options! They were pretty busy and we ordered a bagel breakfast sandwich, latte, two frozen drinks and it was ready in no time!
