Went here once for lunch at the suggestion of a friend from work.  he is no longer my friend.  I've got nothing, it was awful, just awful.  I love the fact that you also get hosed a nice "fee" for using your debit card for any purchase.  Great way to keep them coming back, nickel and dime the piss out of your customers.  The drink refill policy there is a joke.    I'd like to give them an "A" for effort, but they lost me with the craptastic debit card fee and communist-style drink refill pricing, they will receive an overwhelming "F" rating from me.  Change that and I might give ya another shot there, Stalin.

Came here to try something new.  I'm not coming back.  Let's back up a bit.  The sub is decent, a shade higher than subway quality, but that shade might need to be measured by NASA.  Had a hot sub, was heated up in a microwave.  I can do that at home cheaper and without cooking it to the consistency of beef jerky.  Here is what started to get me... I paid for the combo meal, which is 2 dollars and something for a fun size bag of chips and a drink.  Fountain drink stand has dust on it, bad sign.  What does that take that wipe down?  5, maybe 10 seconds? I get a fork at the straw/lid/silverware station afterwards.  4 crumbled up straw wrappers in the silverware station, on top of the forks.  I elect to eat without a fork.  Did the guy who just walked out of the john wash his hands before he took off his straw wrapper with his genital holding hands and throw it in the fork tray?  I have no idea...  Sanitation on that situation = 0.  Guy working in the back was rocking out to the radio.  Confirmed that when I washed my hands after eating and saw him in the kitchen with the door wide open to said work station.  I think checking that area is low on the list of priorities, as evidence would suggest.  Here is what really pisses me off.  My chips taste terrible.  Not crunchy at all.  Came in on 12/18/2012, chips expired on 12/4/1012.  These are nacho cheese Doritos.  Sure, probably somewhat safe to eat a year after that but taste like shit.  My concern is if no one is looking at the expiration date on the chips, are they looking at it on the microwaved meat I just ate?  Or the cold meat they serve?    Bottom line, I don't like eating anywhere that openly advertises they sell expired food.  The chips proved that to me.  Really wish I would have seen that before I ate a few chips before seeing the expiration date and threw the rest of them away in the garbage which is what this place should have done before selling them.    Plenty of other sub shops very close to here I would assume do not do that, I'll give them my cash instead.  You have now been dubbed "Sub Craptory," until you get your act together.  Sure, I could have told someone that works there I bought expired food, but I already have a job.  I don't need to do yours.  I'm just never coming back again.  Expired food = automatic one star.  Congratulations.  I don't know, we are only 2 days away from 12/21/2012, maybe this is what the Mayan's predicted, people would eat your expired food here and all die of food poisoning and that is what ends the world.  I hope not.  That would suck.

five words to describe this place: These people know their shit.  For all you serious gun owners, please continue reading.  Make sure you do not have any children sitting on your lap or a dog, they will get poked.  Common complaints about gun shops.  You have them and I have them, lets run down the list, shall we?  The sales people are assholes and always try to talk down to you, there is NO AMMO, the ammo that they have is extremely overpriced, the guns are nothing but beat to shit AK-47's and Daddy's old shotgun, and there is no selection.  Let's have a look at the Pistol Parlour and see how a gun shop SHOULD be run.  Sales staff.  Wow, that is all I can say.  Very patient understanding staff that is happy to answer any questions you have or show you anything they have.  Even if you tell them you aren't going to buy it but just want to look at it.  No problem and they will tell you anything you want to know.  Even with optics, flip-up sights, etc.  Plus they are more than happy to share their knowledge about what they know (and with these people, it is not just a hobby)  I thought I knew everything about AR's.  How wrong I was.  I felt like a kid trying to use my dick for the first time after they gave me their knowledge of AR's.  Even the brand new Ruger SR-5.56 rifle.  Ruger doesn't know as much about that rifle as they do.  Now, this store is small, but I'm sure who ever owns this read several articles in good housekeeping on how to maximize space because for the inventory they have, it all fits and you don't have someone standing on your dick to move around.  Everything you need is in this place, and surprisingly they don't have a lot of junk.  Good quality products and it is organized so you can find what you need pretty quick.  If you can't, someone that works there will show you where it is at.  The selection.  Take the guns you would find at Big 5.  Got that picture in your head?  Still got it?  O.K., reverse that.  That is the selection you have at the Pistol Parlour.  Again, want to look at something?  No problem, just ask them, they will show it to you.    You know when you have that gun store employee that says something like "Buy a Glock, everything else is shit."  This doesn't happen here.  They will give you the info on everything they sell and let you make the decision based upon what works about you.  I know what you are thinking.  What is the catch?  The prices are terrible right, they are a Mom and Pop shop.  It amazes the hell out of me, the prices are very competitive.  Their ammo is at most 1-2 dollars per box more than the huge stores, BUT (here is the huge but) they always have ammo.  Need pistol ammo, it is there.  Need rifle ammo?  Hey, that is there too.  Shit!  I just forgot, I need a magazine that isn't a promag.  HOLY SHIT!  They have it!!!  I'm all up for supporting the independent businesses that keep the American spirit alive provided I get what I pay for and care about their customers.  Ding! Ding! Ding!  Call the pit boss, we have a winner.  I've referred several of my friends to this place.  I always get the same reaction.  Why didn't you tell me about this place earlier?  Normally, I like to make my reviews as entertaining and as sarcastic as possible.  I have nothing. Have been here probably 12-15 times and the place gets better and better.

Well, pretty sure I am not coming back after my last visit.  Here is why.  After having my truck serviced, a few days later I notice that it is leaking brake fluid.  Cap on the master cylinder doesn't steal anymore.  Great.  Was just charged for brake fluid (although I could have SWORN that was always included in the lifetime breaks deal, don't know why I was charged for it) so I had to buy more at the auto parts store a few days later, as well as a new top to the master cylinder reservoir.  Looks like it was muscled back on and cracked.  Normally, I would over look this, shit happens, but here is why I mention it...  When I had my truck serviced, for over 30 minutes all I was told was all sorts of service that my truck needed.  I kept saying "No, no, no."  I was probably talked to about 10 times about other services I should have done.  I was even brought into another room and talked to for another 10 minutes with paperwork and all sorts of horror stories of how bad of shape my truck is in.  Had the 100,000 mile service from the dealership right before and other than a basic brake service, was told every service that could be done to it they did and truck checked out 100%.  Honestly, I started getting offended.  I bring my vehicles in before service should be done, I never wait until there is a problem and take it in because it is cheaper that way.  I had my brakes looked at the dealership a few weeks before having my brakes done and they told me the ONLY thing that was needed was a basic brake service.  I declined having it done there because I had paid for the lifetime brake service and would save the money and take it back to Just Brakes.  $600.00 bucks later...   Here is why I am pissed about the entire thing.  The speech that is given.  "Well, I mean, your vehicle MADE it here, but not sure how much longer it will stop"  I felt like H.G. Wells wrote a script to "Your truck is a fucking deathtrap that will kill nuns and children in a cross walk if we don't get $1800.00 to fix it (yes that was the original quote) and they were trying to pitch the story to me.  I will give an A+ on the acting there, because it sold me for some upgrades.  With the way everything was presented, they apparently went over my truck with a fine toothed comb, and I paid for it.  What I don't get is they spent a lot of time going over things with my truck, over half of it wasn't even with the brakes and I NEVER asked them to look over and was talked down to about declining all that service (yes, of course the air filter is dirty we live in a desert and no I do not want an oil change, yes the sticker on the windshield does say I am not due for a while so stop asking me) and if it was that extensively gone over, why did I have to buy a new cap to the master cylinder and more brake fluid a few days later?  I guess I am just pissed because every part of my truck had been "gone over" and after paying for it, I still leave with said brake problem.  I know usually an owner or manager will contact people who bitch about service but in this case don't waste the time.  Generally if it is a crappy restaurant I will play back but in this case I just feel like I was had.  Some of my returned parts I was supposed to get were not included, I should have looked them over before I left.  I can understand as work is moving along they just get thrown away off the bat to keep a cleaner shop, but still.  Yes I have worked with cars before I know what is what.  Here is an idea for the company:  Stop with the whole end of the world scenario on peoples cars, just fix what needs to be fixed and stop the completely non-essential repairs (come on, we both know that is the truth) do that and repeat business will keep coming.  If that was the case, I'd always get my brakes done here because the turn around time is pretty good.  Sadly, I will not be returning.  Ever.  No sarcastic remarks for this place, no whitty banter, just not coming back.  Gave 2 stars because a tech in the bay could tell I was getting pissed about getting talked to about all the service and tried to deflect the guy upselling me on stuff.

Initially coming into this Filiberto's for lunch, I thought I had accidentally stumbled into a Halloween themed haunted house.  I check my phone for the date and see that it is too early for Halloween.  Interesting.  Someone tried to pass this place off as a restaurant.  Wow, you got me going, good job.  Scared the shit out of me!  Let us hit the brakes and back up a bit.  The parking lot here has had zero maintenance performed on it.  I think this building used to be an old Carl's Jr. or Jack in the crack that was poorly renovated and has a really piss poor paint job on the exterior.  Potholes in the parking lot made me think my truck had a flex capacitor in it and brought me back in to time to when I was in Philadelphia, dealing with the world's shittiest roads.  Nope, still in Arizona.  I assume there is a lobbyist in the vehicle alignment business working hand and hand with this establishment.  If you can get through this minefield of the parking lot, might as well go for broke and come into the restaurant.  There is an entertainment factor due to the signs all over the place yelling at you to not fill up your cup with soda if you have not paid for it.  Classy.  I don't expect fillet mignon from Filiberto's but I also don't expect to have the cook stare at me the entire time I am waiting for my food.  That guy looks really pissed off.  Been here several times and wanted to enjoy the chip and salsa bar with almost zero chances to seize the opportunity.  The chips that are left are broken if there is any in there at all.  Ask them to put more in, the cook will just stare at you.  No chip refill.  There is a plastic fork laying in one of the salsa containers.  The air conditioning control unit is hanging about a food off of the ceiling only suspended by the failing duct tape trying so hard to defy gravity, like Sylvester Stallone trying to save the girl in the Movie "Cliffhanger."  The walls here looked like there was wallpaper ripped off and never replaced.  A few of the seats have no padding on them,  but plenty of graffitti to read to help pass the time.  My particular booth on one visit read "Fukkin Crakar" written on it.  Maybe I should bring my Mom here for lunch.  I can teach her all there is to know about racial slang.  The bathroom is constantly trashed with no soap and am amazing amount of piss all over the floor.  No worries, there is yet more gang graffitti written in languages I can't read all over the stalls which I assume is not a positive message (like "have a great day, champ!")  There is no sign to indicate the men's room from the women's room either, the first time I was in there the men's room sign was sitting in the urinal.  Think they replaced it?   Bagging on Filiberto's is easy and I know that, but this particular location seems to really go out of their way to have a beat to shit restaurant.  It is more depressing than the condition of a landscaping pick up truck I once owned.    If it wasn't for the Tuesday 99 cent menu... well...I really don't know how to finish this sentence.

Well, I love companies that do a good job and don't rip me off.  Arizona chimney sweep did both.  Clap.  Clap.  Clap.  Let's get to the good job shall we?  I called and scheduled a chimney cleaning and a dryer vent cleaning for my house I have owned almost 4 years.  I know nothing about chimneys and have no idea the last time my dryer vent was cleaned.  I got a discount over the phone when I scheduled both.  Awesome, money saved.  So, here was a huge perk, they did a Saturday appointment at a good time.  Lady on the phone was nice.  Our guy called me about 45 minutes before my appointment, said he was running early and asked if it was cool that he showed up early.  What was good is he said "I know this is earlier than your scheduled time, so if it is too early don't worry about it."  However, all I was doing was watching re-runs of the Simpsons upstairs and was home so I green light him coming over early.   I believe my technician was named Mike.  Nice guy, did not walk on my lawn, had a beard that would have made Chuck Norris proud.  Here is where this guy and this company sold me.  I scheduled a dryer vent cleaning with my chimney cleaning.  Mike walked to the dryer vent outside of the house, saw that my dryer was directly next to the wall and told me it was not necessary to clean that as it is against the wall and explained why.  Guy actually told me and showed me how I can clean it myself (basically just reach up against the vent and pull it out, only need to pay for it if the dryer is not against an exterior wall) and explained why.  Seriously, this guy could have just hooked up a shop-vac to to it and did nothing and lied to me that he was doing something and surfed the net on his cell phone and I would have bought it.  He didn't treat me as an idiot and did not rip me off.  Saved me 100 bucks or so.  Thank you and well done.  When he got to work on the chimney, told him I bought this place about 4 tears ago, never looked at or used the chimney.  This guy had to move my couch and coffee table out of the way to get busy on it, and I mean get busy.  Treated my furniture like his own.  He had something around the chimney that collected any debris that fell out of it, a big blanket or something.  This guy really gave a damn about my house.  After the cleaning was done, actually took a few minutes and showed me how the chimney worked, how to maintain it when they are not around and how to keep smoke from coming into the house.  This guy really educated me on it.  Even gave me a quick follow up quiz on it and gave me a second demonstration on it.  So, the second perk.... This guy did a number on the dirt and debris inside the chimney.  He pimp slapped all the dirt, soot, and all the other ungodly things that have built up inside of it.  If you have ever seen the show it's always sunny in Philadelphia, Mike was Pepperjack and my chimney was his best Ho.  Google it.    Bottom line, this company could have ripped me off with a dryer cleaning.  They did not and explained why and did not charge me for it.  They went to work on my chimney and owned it.  Found my company.  Congratulations, you now have a customer for life.  Take a bow and give Mike a pat on the back.  Will use this company every year.

In a nutshell, this place is awesome.  Frigging awesome.  Since I work close to here, I typically have a lot of the same crappy ass options for lunch that I get sick of.  Original Hoagie challenges these crappy options and comes out the victorious winner, like Tom Berringer in the Movie "Sniper", when he knows he just owned his enemy.  I would come to this place more than once a week if I made more money than I do.  It is just one of those places.    I will give this place my official N.F.A. rating (no fucking around)  Here is my typical experience when I come here.  Now, I have tried about 5-7 things off the menu here in my 100 visits or so and they are all awesome.  Fresh ingredients, lettuce doesn't taste like water, meat doesn't taste like Carl Budding, soft bread (god the bread here...damn...) and kick ass service.  My "regular" item takes a few minutes longer than the typical sub.  The owner sees me in line, has them start making it before I even order it so I don't have to wait as long.   A-fucking plus.      Let's talk about the owner, shall we (I assume, might be the manager, not sure but he is always running the cash register)  This guy is awesome.  And I hate people.  He always asks how my days is going, making small talk, etc.  If I haven't been in for a while, he says things like "been a while since I have seen you!" "how have you been?" "Come back more often!"  He is the guy taking orders every time I have been there.  Since I am not a huge fan of soda, he always gives me a good size ice water and doesn't bitch about it or charge me for a cup.  That charging for a cup thing is horse shit and non-existent at this place.  By the way, no fee for using a debit/credit card either.  I almost always use cash, but a plus for you card users.  The restaurant is always clean.  Tables are free of garbage and left over food.  They always have the daily newspaper to read and I have never been pushed out of there if I read it after my meal is over.  The place doesn't smell of burned bread or rotten meat either, like a lot of other sandwich shops.  If I had to make a complaint it would be that there is no bathroom here for customers.  The place is small and probably lacks the resources for it.  Plus I bet it would piss off the health department if they knew customers were walking through the food prep area to wash their hands which is why it doesn't happen.  Know this before going there and piss/shit and wash your hands beforehand and the bullet has been dodged.  If these instructions are too hard for you, then I assume natural selection will eventually pay you a visit anyway.  I look for any way to cut down a business and with this place I really can't find one.  Can't ding a star for their shitter (or lack of)   If you are in the area and want a good meal, decent price (about 1-2 bucks more than the crappy national chains but after you eat you know where that money went) and good quick service, than give this place a try.  I found it by accident a few years ago and it was one of the best fuck up's I have had from a food point of view.    You are clear to engage the Original Hoagie Shop.  Weapons hot.

Let's make it very clear that this is not a country club, but if you are a golfer like me and play "slightly" over par, this is a good course to play.  Here are the pro's: -Cheap green fees (summertime, it is only 10 bucks for all you can play, I believe after 3 p.m..  I've shown up earlier than that and they still gave me the same price, with a cart.  Awesome) -The staff is pretty cool -You almost never need a tee time, you can show up and they will usually fit you in no problem -No dress code (a huge plus while playing in the summer) -A pretty forgiving course, wider fairways -Cheap hotdogs in the snack area and they pump the AC pretty cold in the lounge -No doglegs on the course (I fucking hate those) -They don't seem to give a shit when you smuggle your own beer on the course -No punk kid cleaning your clubs 2 seconds after you are done playing so you feel obligated to give him a tip  The Con's: -A good portion of the grass is fucked up.  I've dinged the piss out of my clubs having to hit from the dirt on this course -The greens are in bad shape.  You throw away a lot of shots putting from the "mud" or "dirt"  I played there once where some asshole carved a pentagram in the green next to the cup.  It always makes me feel better knowing Satan is watching how shitty I am playing -No bathroom on the course except for the port-o-shitter half way through the course.  It usually has so much urine on the floor and walls you are better off pissing in the bushes or out of the cart when you are driving it.  I was there one time where someone actually shit on the floor of the fiberglass shit house -There seem to be a lot of homeless people between holes 7 and 8 asking for change and/or beers set up by the dumpster next to the golf course  -There are a bunch of cats that run out of the brush in the wash.  I almost hit one with a chip shot the last time I played there.   All things considered, this is a good course to play and have fun at.  Plus you can't beat the price.  Just don't expect Judge Smails at Bushwood Estates.

So, I went here on a trip to Vegas, because, well, the shop is on the TV show pawn stars.  Had to go.  Had to wait in line for 10 or 15 minutes to get in, no big deal.  The door guy was cool, screwing around with everyone, said they are the only pawn shop in the country with a velvet rope and a line to get in.  He joked around with everyone waiting in line because no one likes to wait.  He gets a point for the shop.  The guy with the ponytail deserves a raise.  The pawn shop itself was a bit of a disappointment.  Not that I was really planning on buying anything, I was in Vegas and lost my ass at the tables the night before.  Inventory was pretty weak and seemed like what was for sale was pretty high end and was a bit over priced.  No one inside gave us any pressure to buy anything though, that was a huge plus.  Although the Jim Morrison painting you see in every episode is not for sale.  Weak.  Seemed like the best sellers they have are the pawn stars merchandise in the back.  All I wanted was a Rick magnet, and that was the only one they were sold out of.  Figures.  No sale.  Didn't get to see any of the staff that is on TV in the store here but I didn't expect to.  I bet those guys spend their days by the pool drinking beer cashed in on the TV show.  I hope so.  God bless the American dream.  Here is the best part about this place.  When I was leaving, there was a cab driver leaning against a customers car.  A guy that works at the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop (the guy proudly displaying his handgun holstered), points at the cab, yells at the cab driver "Is this your cab?"  Cab driver says "Yes."  Pawn guy yells at him "Then quit leaning against that fucking car!"  Any business that looks after their customers shit like that says something good about the place.  Awesome!!!    If you have watched this show even once and have a free hour to kill in Vegas, go check this place out.  Take a picture outside of the place to show your buddies.  It won't change your life, but a cool tourist trap.

CK's, why did it take so long for me to write a review on you?  Perhaps I have taken your awesomeness for granted.    I am always critical of neighborhood bars.  Read my reviews, I'm critical of everything.  Believe it or not, I've even been called an asshole.  The thing is, I really don't have anything bad to say about this place.  I hope the owner/manager reads this because the only way a local bar survives is with repeat business, and you sir and/or madam, have earned mine.  I will now use my college education to cite with examples:  Here is one thing you are kicking ass and taking names at Dirty Harry style. (did I fire five chicken wings or six?  In all the confusion, I have kind of lost track myself)  Daily specials.  Not only are they awesome, they never change.  Nothing pisses me of more than expecting something, driving down, and it is different.  I have been coming in for quite a while on Tuesday nights with one of my friends.  We always order the same thing (by the way, 40 cent wings on Tuesday and HUGE beer for $2.50...bring that shit on)   That leads me to your servers.  Usually, we are lucky enough to have the same one, and she is frigging awesome.  Knows our regular order, walks up, takes the menu's away, jokes and says "I know what your order is!" and brings it.  (extra buck or two on the tip just for that) Even if we have another server, they are always polite, attentive, and friendly.  Not coming up every 5 minutes bothering me or being non-existent.  Seems like they wait until you are 75 percent done with your drink and THEN ask if you want more.  Perfect.  They attack with military precision few possess.    Longest I think I have probably ever waited for my wings was 10 minutes.  Maybe.  Had a family birthday party here a few months ago on a weekend night and they made things VERY easy and everything was organized.  Still on the subject of the servers, seems like there is virtually no turn over here and the wait staff seems like they actually enjoy their jobs, not like my job and unlike some other bars where the employees are bitchy and seem like they would rather stab you in the throat than take your order.  CK's does not possess the bitchiness and violent tendencies as previously described.  Other good points condensed in cliff note form:   -Bands 3 nights a week with no cover.  Awesome.   -The video games actually work.  Nothing pisses me off more than cramming a few dollars into playing big buck hunter and the fucking gun is broken.  Or golden tee and the goddamn wheel is lopsided.  The "claw machine" actually has prizes you can win that are big enough for my dogs to at least have more than 5 minutes tearing up before I have to take it away. -pool tables aren't crooked or ripped up felt.  All required balls are present and accounted for (it is amazing how many bars think two or three balls missing is acceptable) -Bathroom is free of the typical "lake of piss" found under urinals or the crapper.  Also very little graffiti on the stalls. -I don't think I have ever seen a dirty table here longer than 60 seconds.  Nicholas Cage can't even steal a car that fast. -Patrons here seems to have a much lower douche bag ratio than most neighborhood bars.  Still there, just lower. -They serve Pabst cheap (honestly I can't drink that ghetto piss but my Dad loves it and that is why he comes here) -They have that awesome trivia shit on the TV's.  Bad points about this place:  ..............I'll edit this if I ever come across any.  Until then, this section stays blank.    Keep up the good work!

This location is without a doubt the most awful Burger King I have ever been to, including truck stops.  The employees at this location are the biggest festival of douch bags I have ever had the displeasure of being around.  Let me enlighten you with my two part story.  The first time I went to this location, I went through the drive thru.  Getting home, I now know the pain of Leo Gets in the movie Lethal weapon 2, and symphatize with him in his stance of how they always fuck you at the drive thru.  I get back home to realize I am a pawn in Burger Kings game of fucking their customers at the drive thru.  I drive back, let them know my order was wrong.  The manager looks in my bag, goes back and talks to the cook.  They forgot about me and 10 minutes later I remind him I am still waiting for my order.  He brings out a bag and drops about 6 inches on the counter in front of me.  Doesn't say a word.  I suppose this was my fault.  Pencildickmanager looked at me as it was.  O.K., perhaps they were having a day.  Perhaps I should have looked at my food when I left.   Regardless, I hope the manager is reading this.  If you are, your a dick (yes, you.  The fat guy)   Part two, which I have entitled: Tempting fate, I decide to go back to this restaurant once again.  I should have stuck with my intuition, like when a dog knows it is about to storm and starts barking and acting weird.  Sitting in the "dining room" this time (although the amount of garbage in the room resembled more what I think the threshold to hell would look like)  I think the only place that didn't have garbage in it was the trash cans.  My food was not only incorrect, but tasted like what I can only describe as, well, for a lack of a better word..... dogshit.  I think my hamburger patty was awake longer than I was and had the texture of a belt.  I wouldn't even let my dogs eat this trainwreck of a "meal."  I told the kid who reminded me of Rainman working the counter that the burgers were pretty bad and he might want to cook some fresh ones.  He just started at me like he saw a pair of tits for the first time.  I don't think this kid will strive to be a member of the space program.    I will never go back to this store and I hope someone who works there reads this.  Although I doubt that.  I think they are spending more time standing around thinking of ways they can piss off their customers and be generally non-productive.  I can only become religious and pray that if I ever have kids, they are smarter then the staff at this burger king.    Much like the old lady in the movie Poltergeist, I give you a warning, Caroline.  Stay away from here, this is Satan's Burger King.

What a dump.  This place needs to be condemned.  I don't even know where the laundry list of disappointment begins with this place.  Lets walk a customer through a trip to this place.  The parking lot.  I would like to find out who designed the layout of the parking lot and castrate them and their family.  The parking spots are smaller than my dick.  Door dings or someone smashing into your bumper are a almost a guarantee.  Only thing smaller than the parking spots are the tables inside this place.  Good luck negotiating the drive through.  Walking into the place:  Once you get past the homeless people begging for change, you go inside to almost always find more of their clan sitting at a table, asking for more money.  Even when you are eating.  I've had some of them sit at my table and start asking for my food or money.  This has happened more than once.    Always smells like bile outside here.  No one working there seems to give a shit.  The carpet.  You know those run down casinos just outside of Las Vegas, with 50 years of dirt, smoke, piss, and drinks spilled on them?   This place looks like it bought their carpet from them and let 10 years of wear continue afterwards previously mentioned conditions.  Then added all sorts of fries, condiments, and other various shit all over the place.  I stepped in gum there last month in the dining room carpet.  Told an employee and they said "O.K."  Wiped it off my shoe on a chair.  Was still there last week when I came back.  Have never been here without at least seeing ketchup or mustard on the walls or chairs somewhere.  Gross.  The crew: I love trying to eat my 3000 calorie meal listening to the crew YELLING at each other in Spanish.  Has happened every time I have been here.  The bathroom: Jesus, hold it, piss in the parking lot, or go before you get here.  I am sure there is some sort of paranormal activity in the john there coming out of the plumbing.  A month ago there was a syringe inside the toilet.  Lovely.  Could probably just piss on the carpet of the dining room while eating, I don't think anyone will notice.  Or care for that matter.  Food seems to be the typical garbage at all Jack in the Box restaurants, so no ding on them for that.  However, I always feel like I need a shower after I eat here.  A plus:  Seems a lot of the day crew entertainers that work at the strip joint next door eat lunch at this dive before their shift.  At least they have that going for them.

Sadly, I'm giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.  The Manger/operator guy.  Sure, the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive, don't seem to be meth addicted, and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often, and I know why.  My beef is not with the crew members, oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy, the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now.  This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually, one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon, this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order, give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously, what is it, 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order, cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu, they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said "sorry"  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then, was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you.  Last trip here, they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last, I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip, and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat, I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order, ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order, says "This is your order, this is what you have" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me, the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand, gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that, even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him, puts his hand in front of the guys face, and says "ssssshhhhhh" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening, he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog, what does that cost you anyway, about 12 cents in batter, a stick, and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?    Dude (cashier guy, tattoo on your arm), tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.  No one deserves that shit.  I am actually ashamed I didn't say something for you, I truly am.  What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.  My rant speaks for itself.  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.  For the ones working there, I will pray for you.  You need it.  P.J.L., get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana, they need midget controlling assholes over there.  You would do great at that.

Yeah, the food here isn't all that bad.  I'd give the food 4 stars by itself.  But...  Service = shit restaurant = shit  Normally you get what you pay for, but the prices here are a fucking insane.  On my last visit, I paid somewhere around 14 dollars for a cheesesteak, fries, and drink and slice of pizza.  The girl at the counter told me a price after I asked her roughly what the total would be (told me all that would be about 8 bucks) and after ringing up the total, it was around 14.  OK...    When asked what I wanted on it, I asked for wiz but light on it.  A few people working there laughed at me.  Hey fuckers, were not in Philly, were in the desert.  Some of us don't like that much on the sandwich.  A guy making my sandwich spills some steak on the counter, picks it up with his fingers and puts it back on the sandwich.  Nice.  He gives me a "what is your problem" look.  Another lady working there spent the ENTIRE time (waiting in line, ordering, waiting for food, and eating) looking at her cell phone.  Anyway, the food is awesome, worth trying if you don't mind the price tag.  Sitting in the restaurant to eat itself is cramped.  I was lucky enough to get a seat at the "bar" that is crooked.  My drink falls over.  I try to clean it up but there is a line of people standing around me.  I give up.  The condiment bar looks like a dog gnawed a ton of shit together and left it there.  I couldn't tell what was what.  They were out of ketchup.  I didn't even bother telling them.  I will agree that the food here does resemble what you get in Philly (minus the pizza, stay away from that.  Came out cold, told them, they did nothing) but hardly worth putting up with the fucking service there.  If I wanted to be treated like shit I'll go to work, but I'm not paying for it.  *updated as of 3/17/211* Lowering to one star.  Decided to give this place a try again and they pissed me off.  Ordered two slices of pizza before a St. Patricks day adventure.  Ordered to a guy who told me to "wait a second" as he was checking his cell phone.  For about two minutes.  What the fuck?  Took my order and I waited.  Drunk college girls came in after me (bear in mind, this was around 6p.m.) and gave my food to them because they ordered the same thing.  I wait.  Again longer.   He flirts with them.  I ask him about my food.  He is checking his cell phone.  I hear employees at the soda fountain saying "We aren't going to have enough fucking ice tonight!" as they asked the cook for a kitchen knife to cut ice bags open.  Cook take the knife back after it is it used for cutting open ice bags and dropped two times on the floor, and hands it back to the cook.  I only was able to observe this because I spent the better part of 20 minutes waiting for my food with nothing else to do.  He cuts bread with it without washing it.  Lovely.  Since they "forgot" about my order so John Q. Cashregister could forget about mine and give it away to try and hook up with college girl customer, my pizza slices were only warmed up for about 30 seconds.  The center was cold.  A few bites into it, I throw the rest in the garbage.  And the napkin dispenser is out.  I tell the guy but he is too obsessed with getting pussy.  F this place.  I hope the owner of this place reads this.

In the movie "Point Break," Gary Busey, playing the role of Angelo Pappus, says I line I used to use.  "Around the corner, there is a sandwich shop that sells meatball sandwiches, best I have ever tasted."  I used to use this line before going to Sami's, until today.  You took the meatball sub, THE meatball sub of the menu.  I looked at the menu for about 2 minutes, didn't see it.  I asked the guy at counter "Hey, do you still have the meatball sub?"  I was told no.  I had been thinking of that sub for a few hours.  I received the equivalent of blue balls in some sort of distorted food equation.  If I wrote this review before today, you would have received 5 stars for that sandwich alone.  Since I wrote it today, you know what you got.  I feel that strongly about the situation because I don't have much else going for me.  I haven't been this upset since saved by the bell was moved to the mornings when it used to be in the afternoons.  Your Gyros are way too dry for me to eat them, and nothing else is good enough to keep me coming back.  Except for that meatball sub.  I had a punch card, buy 11 meals and your 12th is free.  It was almost all the way filled up.  I had to put that in the garbage today to prove to myself I will never return until your meatball sub does.  It was surrendered, like my faith in Sami's.  It is like you broke up with me via text messaging.    Johnny Utah is NOT bringing me my meatball sandwiches.  This Calvin and Hobbes is NOT funny.  I DO want some oranges.  Sami's....  You have failed.

I have given this establishment a nickname after eating here.  The "papago's crapfe grill and barf emporium."  Your one stop shopping for a wide array or tasteless overpriced crap that is pushed off as "food."  Eating the food here is similar to most experiences I have had at the DMV.  The selection is terrible, I can generally find more food to eat at a Toys R us than I can find here.  I wish this place served alcohol so I could get drunk enough to be able to choke down this prison grade crap.  The only satisfaction I get when I have eaten here is trying to throw away some of their very limited condiments or a food tray.  The people working here have the personality of robots (like one in an auto manufacturing plant, not the cool funny one Johnny Five from the movie "Short Circuit")  If your stuck working in the building it is located in, you are limited for options around there.  I would suggest going out to your car and eating the upholstery on your seat.  It will be a much more rewarding experience for you.  DO NOT eat at the salad bar.  Unless you have 2-3 hours later in the day to spend in the can.  Make sure to bring a snowcone to wipe your ass with afterwards.  You think I am kidding?  I dare you to tempt fate if you think I am fabricating this fact.  The daily specials they have are also a good indicator of what is about to spoil the next day.  To sum up my eating experiences at the papago's cafe grill & deli is much like having the UPS man deliver a long awaited package of disappointment.    Plus the prices suck ass beyond belief.

I would like to tell you a story about the worst day of my life.  It was when I came to your worthless"bar"  Your overpriced cocktails have the alcohol content of a handi-wipe at best.  I can also conclude that you do not have any sort of benefits offered to your employees because they walk by customers several times and cannot seem to recognize what a customer holding cash looks like.  Send them to an eye doctor.  They are too busy checking their cell phones and showing each other their awful, awful tattoos.  The prisoners in a concentration camps received better service from the Nazis then I got from the employees at your bar.  I had such a bad experience that I feel I will never be able to get an erection ever again, until I hear that your place has gone out of business (I'm sure it will very soon)  The only compliment I have is that I am glad you allow dogs on your patio.  I plan to bring them mine over soon after eating five cans of Hormel chili in the hopes they will piss and s*** all over the place and hopefully maul a member of your useless staff.  If a member of the police force shows up and have been to your dump bar, they will understand and let me go.  I predict your hellhole will soon be turning into a gay bar.  P.S. - The food you offer..... wow.  I can't believe you try to pass that kibble off as food.  The health department will be by soon and will close your virtual food "house of horrors" ASAP.  Great food if you are constipated and need to do a little spring cleaning.  If you are bulimic, come eat here.  Guaranteed to make you puke.  Looking forward to the day you go out of business.

Walk the other way, just walk right the hell the other way...  Here was how this played out.  Oktoberfest a few days ago.  Starting the night off.  I walk past this place and see a place that sells a slice of pizza for $1.99.  Good, right?  No.    me: "Hi, one slice of pizza please" guy: "you buy drink with it, 4 dollars." me: "no, just one slice of pizza" guy: "we do not sell one slice, you have to buy a drink.  4 dollars"  I should have pulled a flag on this play at this point, but knowing I was going to be drinking I move forward wanting food in me. Not a wise move.  me: "so, I can't buy one slice?" guy: "no, you buy a drink with slice, 4 dollars." me: "It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu or walls" guy: "No, do not sell one slice. me: "what the... O.K., give me 2 slices of pizza" guy: "you buy two slices then." me: "yes, Jesus Christ, yes" guy: "toppings?" me: "no, no toppings.  cheese." guy: "we have toppings."  what is this guy, fucking deaf?   me: "no thanks"  I give him the money.  guy: "it take 10 minutes, you wait."  I don't think they run the air conditioner in this place, so I wait outside.  Pizza comes out.  Tastes like absolute crap.  I eat it outside because in September in Chandler Arizona it is cooler outside then inside this place.  I think they had the thermostat set to "HELL" Guy working or running the place comes outside and stares me down as I am eating.  I'm sure if you want to eat here you can check the dumpster for plenty of slices to try beforehand to avoid having to pay for one.  Excuse me, avoid having to pay for two.  However after what I had served to me I'm pretty sure they will beat you to the garbage cans and sell it back to some other unsuspecting soul.  I was the only one dumb enough to finish all the food.  Wouldn't eat here if there was a natural disaster and this place was the last to be ransacked for provisions.  I'd keep walking.  FAIL.

Do not come here. Terrible experiences all the time. Hot-and-ready my ass. The only thing that seems to be ready here is the soda in the cooler or the ranch dressing. Seriously, everything on the menu that says hot-and-ready has NEVER been available except the generic 5 dollar pizzas (on occasion).  Final nail in the coffin came tonight. Was told that I would need to wait 10 minutes. Fine. An employee after 20-25 minutes asked me what I was waiting for. When I let them know they informed me that they gave it away to another customer. Fine. I was told it would come out in about 10 minutes.    Brought the pie home and after biting into it...raw dough. Fuck. Put it in the oven when we got home and gave up on the experiment. The rest will go in the garbage and be transported to a landfill. I would assume the one out in Gilbert.  Called up the store to tell them the situation and spoke with a manager. Informed him of the raw state of the dough. He did offer to remake the pizza for me, but I wasn't driving back. I had already spent 45 minutes waiting for an under cooked pizza, imagine how long it would take for a finished one.  Being in the spirit of Christmas, we rewrote a Christmas song for this store, as sadly I can no longer endure our relationship together seeing as you no longer care about my feelings.  I am only out 8 bucks for the experience, so life will go on. It will not go on with this locations food for me. Sung to the tune of "I'll be home for Christmas"  Cue the band...  I'll be home with pizza If only in my dreams!

Aaaahh, Tempe, my old college stomping grounds.  Pizza.  Awesome.  Thank you Eddie's pizza and lounge for pissing in the face of my college memories.  For the better part of three weeks finding a vast array of coupons from this place all over my truck, typically five or six in the door handle and the all famous stack of them in the now bent windshield wiper of my truck, I decide to give this place a try.  I will take this regret to my grave.  Five bucks for a large pizza and a drink, shit that is an awesome deal!  At least I thought it was.  I would have been better off giving my money to a bum and having him punch me in the nuts.    After calling the number on the coupon that littered my truck and parking lot, I decide to place an order for their special.  I ask if their coupon special includes delivery.  The girl answering the phone said "Really, well you are going to be waiting for a long time, it isn't that big of an order.  We don't like to deliver for the coupon special."  I assume that is the business equivalent of "Fuck no" so I tell her I'll just come pick it up.  I am told my order will be ready from 20 minutes to an hour.  Somewhat of a vast window, but I live close so I decide to request a dance from the devil.  The devil won.  I show up about 30 minutes later (seemed reasonable) and was told I need to wait and was offered to rent a hookah while I waited.  Are you fucking serious?   Not wanting anyone to spit in my food, I politely tell her no and sit down on the couch to watch the game on T.V.  She then turns the channel to something else.  Leaving 20 minutes later when my pizza is done, the cook comes out after handing it over to her, runs out, asks me what I ordered.  I tell him and he opens up the box again, looks at it, and says I am good to go.  I don't know what the hell that is about until I get home.  Of course, they fucked up my order.  I'm not surprised or amused.  At least I got my can of soda.  I take the pizza home.  Not what I ordered.  In retrospect, I should have put a Totinos in the oven.  This pizza tasted like a generic undercooked store brand pizza.  Not only was my order wrong, it was very undercooked.  I had to put it in my own oven when I got home, missing even more of the game.  I ate 3 slices and threw the rest away.  I didn't even want to give the leftovers to the dogs, they would probably bite me for feeding them that shit.    Seriously, how do you ruin pizza?  It is like toast.  The food was shit, the service was even worse.  But that can of Mountain dew I got was nice and chilly.  At least they have that going for them.  You earned one star.    The coupons from this place no longer blow around the parking lot of where I live like tumbleweeds on a holy war of declaring jihad against tastebuds around the greater Tempe area, but the scars of eating here will remain forever.

It sucks that this location is the closest gas station closest to my house on the way to work because it it is a nightmare here. I'm not holding a gas station to high standards by any means, but this place really sucks. most of the gas pumps here do not work right, if you are the fortunate one to tell one of the zombies working here "hey, pumps 3, 4 and 8 aren't working, bit number 10 is and didnt give me a fucking receipt, again" the follow up questions are usually something of the following variety not limited to but including "oh, yeah, that pump doesn't work" or "yeah, the debit reader is not working" or the lady who told me "yeah, that piece of shit card reader doesn't work, so prepay as much as you think you will need, and then come back in for the difference you don't need."  When the literally 1 in 3 times I am able to drive to the first gas pump and have the debit card reader work, it still pops up with a message to go inside for a receipt, shutting down all hope of a quick transaction.  usually the response is "yeah, a lot of people have been coming in for receipts " or "you have to come in for a receipt"  I love that, a real doozey.  The only fortunate part of this is I can tell one of the Rhodes Scholars working here that there are typically 1-3 people asking me for money as I am getting gas or some useless teenager eating candy like a Spaniard next to the redbox machine.  They don't care.  Getting gas here sucks, but what really pisses me off about this place is when you need to use the windshield squeegee to clean the windshield.  I don't know what is in here but the few times I have used these whatever is in the water is rancid as hell.  I spilled a bit of it on my hunting boot that has seen blood, sweat, chemicals, shit, and Tucson.  Nothing killed these until some of the complimentary windshield water spilled on them.  The smell from that water cannot be erased, I doubt these things have ever been emptied only have water added to them.  Smells like the windshield squeegee raped me until it made the room stink.  I can't wait until the gas station being built down the street is finished.

So, I went here for lunch.  Paid extra to have the large sub combo so I would have leftovers for dinner.  Didn't happen.  I ordered the BLT meal, paid extra to have the larger sub, cost about 9 and a half bucks.  OK if I can make two meals out of it, which was my plan.  This did not happen.  Not too impressed.  Now the bread, 5 stars on that.  Thick and soft, good flavor.  Sadly, that is where the compliments end.  There was three pieces of bacon on the sub.  Three.  9 and a half dollars.  Three pieces of bacon.  9 and a half bucks.  (I am trying to prove a point here)  I am not happy.  It was basically a lettuce sub.  Everyone else I went to lunch with had more meat in their sub than Ron Jeremy has in his pants.  Not mine.  I threw away the second half of my lettuce sub because, well it was a lettuce sub.  The staff was friendly and service was quick.  Sadly, does not make up for screwing me out of the bacon content of my sub.  The slices of bacon that were evident were small, like the ones you get on a 99 cent menu fast food burger.    I was told to try something else by my friends if I go back there.  I don't think they will get the chance.  Bacon up the BLT.  Until then... Pass.

Well, you guys did it.    My work switched buildings on me so now I am in this area.  Had to scout out new places to go for lunch and found this place.  See, I go to lunch with my buddy from work who was born/raised in Chicago and bitches and whines if something isn't truly "authentic" and sure, he has his list of things that aren't but this place still rocks like the band Whitesnake in the 80's.  He has signed off on this place as being well above exceptional.  On a budget, this place takes care of you.  Hell, for good food this places takes care of you.  Usually, I go for the double dog (which comes with an order of fries which I believe they double fry.  Apparently this is a Chicago thing but I don't know what the hell that means.  All I know is they are crispy)  Typically I always get a hotdog of some sort and like a Schwarzenegger movie, it doesn't disappoint.  Had the meatball sub once to be different once and was all right.  Not bad, but all right.  Will stick to the hot dogs.  Seems like I find myself here at least once a week, with the all to familiar conversation of "where do you want to eat?" and this is always our fallback spot.  Other awesome pros I would like to add: -They leave the tv remote out on the table.  Got to piss off other people by watching a  "Saved by the Bell" a few weeks ago.  It was the dramatic episode where Jesse Spano was hooked on the pep pills so she could slam dunk the piss out of her test scores. -Girl who works the counter 100% of the time always asks "So how is your day going?" -Prices.  Very reasonable.  Thank you - (signed all underpaid corporate workers) -Typically clean tables, especially for the amount of customers who come in and out of here.  Seems more people have come in and out of here then they have inside of Paris Hilton.  One suggestion: a-la-catre (am I spelling that right?) for a hot dog without the fries.  Just a suggestion.

All right, instead of giving details and fucking up the entire experience of this place for anyone (like finding out that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalkers father before you watch the movie) I will keep this one short and simple and give nothing away.  All I will say is before you go through the haunted house is that you are greeted by a headless horseman that kicks some serious ass (and a very, VERY well trained horse)    This place rocks.  All I will say is I went with two of my friends to this place last weekend and I had nail marks these girls dug into my arms and wrists.  3 days later and they are still there.  Thanks "Jo"  I will only give advice.  Get there early so the line isn't as long unless you don't care about waiting.  If you pay extra for the VIP line, you can avoid this.  I recommend paying it (if you get on their website, you can print off a 2 dollar coupon for the regular deal of 4 bucks off for the VIP.  We should have gone VIP)  There is a 5 dollar charge to park in the dirt which sucks, but I guess everyone is trying to get theirs.    Once you start the actual haunted house, takes about 30-40 minutes to get through at an easy pace.  Has about 3 "parts" to it that are all awesome.  Staff here was cool, no jerks working.  Seems like they really like what they are doing and if you are getting paid to scare the hell out of people, who wouldn't.  It is cash only, so come prepared unless you want to use the Rawhide ATM which is worse than most strip clubs.  My friends were scared shitless, I thought it was awesome.  Make it happen.

So, on most weekends, I get stuck working late.  Real late.  Most of the time I need to eat before I get home.  That is when I rely on the 24 hour fast food joints.  As much as I try to avoid them, but with my situation, they do come into play.  This McDonalds is no better or worse than any other as far as the food is concerned.  Crap.  At that late, I face the reaper and need to admit this and go into it willingly.  But this one is across the street from my house, easy to get to on my drive home.  Driving through at about 3 in the morning, and having to wait for 12 minutes for the car in front of me, here is the transcript of my ordering experience.  drive thru - "Hello, what can I make for you?" Me - "Do you have the 20 piece mcnuggets for five dollars?" drive thru - "No sir." Me - "Oh, you have a huge promo poster I am looking at that says you do, in front of your store." drive thru - "No, sir, it is not 5 dollars, it is $4.99, not 5 dollars." Me - "Sure, that sounds good.  I'll have that." drive thru - "It is not 5 dollars, it is $4.99." Me - "Yeah, that is fine, I'll take one order of those." drive thru - "The price is different, you want to order them?"  At this point, I have been up for over 21 hours, working 2 jobs for about 16 of those.  I'm doing my best not to lose my shit.  Me - "Yes that is fine." drive thru - "Sauce?" Me - "Just ketchup." drive thru - "No sauce?" Me - "Ketchup is fine." drive thru - "Something to drink?" Me - "No thanks." drive thru - "No drink?" Me - "No thanks." drive thru - "Fries?"  I don't answer, I drive to the window.  I get my food and drive home.  For 20 nuggets, there are 4 packets of ketchup.  No napkins.  The roommate, who we will call "Joe," is still up.  I eat 10 nuggets and am done.  I give the rest to said roommate.  Apparently, the second box of nuggets have been sitting out longer than the first box, and he spits one out on the floor after taking a bite.  My dog happily eats the remains.  I'm making sandwiches when I get home from now on.

Although 2013 has not officially ended yet, I think it is safe to assume I can issue out my award for the crappiest transaction I have made of the year. Go Wireless, you not only made the cut, you exceeded every expectation of what a retail store should NOT do.  This place looks like a Verizon store. I didn't even know it wasn't a Verizon store until halfway through my transaction. No big deal. Was even told that there was a 30 dollar charge Verizon has for dealing with this store. O.K., whatever.  I pay for the phone, renew the contract for 2 years and pay the 30 dollar fee. I am told that with the plan I am changing to I will save over 10 bucks a month.  Outstanding, unfortunately not true.  Fast forward. After I get home a day or so later I try to call people I know. Numbers are no longer on my new phone. I also have contacts on there from 3 phones ago.  One guy on my contact list had been dead for over 5 years. I look over the bill. I paid 20 bucks to have my contacts moved over. Obviously a fail. I bring the phone back to the store, tell them the situation. Guy I bought the phone from hooks my old phone back up to the new one again. Says I am good to go.  Every contact is listed again for the last 3 phones I had. Says there is nothing he can do about that, and just to delete the old numbers. Again, I paid 20 bucks for this honor.  I get my Verizon bill shortly after. I am charged 30 bucks. I call Verizon, they say no, you pay us 30 bucks for going through them, and they charges you 30 dollars for their own fee.  Now at 60 bucks. Smoke and mirrors. Sure I get it. I figure the hell with it, they got me, keep the money, you won.  Normally I would have let it go, never done business with them again. So, that 10 dollars a month I was supposed to save (by the way did not happen, bill was still the same) however I notice my debit card is being charged 7 bucks a month. So, in addition to paying the same amount on the monthly bill, I am now paying extra for the insurance. 10 bucks a month not saving, plus 7 bucks extra for insurance, $408.00 extra over two years.  If that doesn't sound like a lot, send me a check for $408.00.  Funny thing is, I never gave them my debit card to give the insurance company, nor do I ever authorize automatic deductions from my account. When I asked go wireless about this, no one could ever produce a document where I authorized a third party to start billing me.    So, it gets worse. I call go wireless on the number on my invoice.  no one calls me back. I go down to the store, told I can only talk to the manager I bought the phone from.  Apparently the employees in the store cannot do anything about it.  Went in twice when the manager was supposed to be in. He wasn't.  Finally, after several messages, I actually get him on the phone.  He says the store just opened up (even though it was an hour past when the website says they open) and he doesn't have a computer on. I tell him I can wait. He says he will call me back in a half hour. He doesn't. I call back later that day, leaving a few messages telling the manager specifically to call me back. Phone never rang back.  I call back 3 separate days and leave messages. Guess what, phone never rang back.  I go back into the store, of course the only soul who can apparently help me is a fucking ghost.  I tell the kid working the counter my dilemma, DO NOT CHARGE MY DEBIT CARD EVERY MONTH, why the hell is this happening?  Can you provide me a document where I authorized a third party who I have no idea who they are to have access to my bank info and charge me every month? He hands me a brochure with their phone insurance companies info and apologizes that I did not receive that when I bought my phone and was not informed that I would be charged every month separate from my Verizon bill. I wonder if I am supposed to wipe my ass with it because I don't care at this point, I am pissed off I was never told.  I leave a message with the kid working the counter to have the manager, the only person who can do anything about this, to call me A.S.A.F.P. the next day.  he said he would be there in the morning and would make sure he called me tomorrow. No call was made to me.  Finally, a week later I get this fucking guy on the phone. He instantly knows who I am because he has black belt skills in dodging any sort of effort to even talk to me.  Tells me he worked it out and and my debit card will not be charged anymore for the insurance on the phone. I ask him twice after that "Are you sure?" He said yes. Nope, statement next month billed me for the insurance. Thanks dick hole.  See, here is the deal guy. If you are an asshole, rip me off, sell me something that sucks, I can generally deal with that. However, you lied to me. Several times.  When you lie to someone, especially a customer, you are saying "Your stupid." The hell with this store, hope to God this place is out of business soon. Don't be stupid do NOT go here.   Fuck you go wireless.

Well. Freaking. Done.  Was referred to Tim Ritter from a friend of mine at work.  Had an issue with my truck that the dealership had fixed twice before.  Known issue on the motor for my awesome, loud, gas-guzzling piece of badass American F-150, so the repair was anticipated those times but quite expensive.  Hovered around 1200 bucks each time from the dealership for each repair.  And we are due for the same repair again...(normally I would insert profanity here but I don't want that associated with this business)  Thought I was going to get ripped off going to a local mechanic.  I called him and he gave me the low down over the phone how he does not like mechanics taking advantage of people.  Spent about 10 minutes on the phone letting me know the work he does and why.  Wants to give honest work for an honest price.  Also said he would look the truck over without charging me anything.  Said he wouldn't do any work on it until I told him to.  No obligation or ridiculous, laughable charge of 100 bucks to hook it up to a computer.  Yeah, heard that before.    My head spun when it was true.  Literally took a minute for it to sink in.  It was like I was punched in the head with savings.  Same repair dealership has done before, only at a third of the price.  Yeah, a third going here.  You do the math.  Had him throw in a brake job and oil change while the truck was there so I didn't have to jack around with it later.  Again, good price and done correctly.  Quickly.  I hope this guy outlives me so I never have to find another mechanic.
