This restaurant is amazing. Tonight I had the prime rib with brussel sprouts and the carbonara pasta. It was amazing! Everything was top notch. I loved it and absolutely will be back. Also the wine selection is truly good as well.

America's friendliest airport and my home town. They do it right here and are very efficient. You'll love the restaurants. Try Cartel Coffee for the best latte in town. I also think the new Humble Pie looks amazing.

I really like their clothes. The pricing is good and so is the quality. If you shop their sales then you will always get good value and in this economy I think that is a vital aspect for any business. The only negative comment I would make is that sometimes they seem understaffed and on this visit they had half the dressing rooms closed which was not convenient and caused a wait.

We absolutely love Shanghai Club. When we moved in to Anthem in 2005 we discovered this gem of a chinese restaurant. I love the Chow Fun or the Chow Mein with crispy noodles. They are always prompt when we order take out and quick service when we dine in. I'm sure we will continue to go there for years to come.

I still love Safeway. I know the prices are not the most competitive, but this location is so bright and airy and clean. The staff are wonderful and always call you by name when you checkout and offer to help you with your groceries to your car. I guess I like it because I still feel they offer excellent customer service. Thanks and keep up the great work.

I absolutely love FEZ. This is probably in my top 5 favorite Phoenix restaurants. It always has a great vibe and great food to go with it. I can't say enough how much I enjoy going there. The food is eclectic and kitsch. The drinks are also fantastic. I highly reccomend their blood marys! Go there and enjoy!

Its Walmart. As far as Walmarts go it is very clean inside and out. That is a plus compared to most locations I've been too. I'd still much prefer we had something else in our community, but it is what it is. If they ever start treating their employees better then I would consider giving them more stars, but they continue to pay their employees low wages and offer them little to no benefits.

After all these years I still love PV Mall. I'm shocked the McDonalds closed after all these years. Clearly I haven't been here in a while. It brings back tons of memories from childhood. The remodel they did years back is nice and I like the furniture throughout the mall. The crowd looks clean cut and even the kids look like upstanding citizens. I'd come back a lot if I lived closer to it.

If you are in to massage, but can't always make it to a fabulous resort then I highly reccomend Hand & Stone Massage in Anthem. I've been twice and both times they have provided a level of service and atmosphere similar to a five star resort. Now they can't really touch that experience, but I must say they come as close as possible to doing so without the price and drive it would take to get one at the Phoenician or Four Seasons. I like their promotions and marketing and next time I need a massage I'm sure I would choose them again.

I love these donuts. So do the kids! They are very nice folks too. My middle son loves the glazed donuts and I love the croissants.

I love this hometown grocery store. Yes I know it's owned by Kroger's, a huge conglomerate, but it truly feels like my hometown store in the neighborhood. The people are always friendly and the prices are probably the best other than Walmart. I'll continue to shop here for years to come.

This place is way too expensive for dry cleaning in Phoenix. I also live in Los Angeles and I don't even pay these prices there. Dry cleaning services are pretty standard from location to location, but they seem to think they can charge outrageous prices for their services. They are nothing special and I won't be back again until they lower their prices.

This is a well run location of the UPS Store. They are always extremely helpful whenever I come in. Typically I am there to drop off my Amazon returns; I'm sure they make no money off of offering this service. However, they still always smile, take my return, and offer me a receipt for proof of drop off. I rarely need them for anything else, but if I did need them for any of the services they offer then they would be my first choice.

This is a good restaurant for quick Chinese. Today the kids were rather disappointed because the orange chicken was cold and didn't have much sauce. We come here often and this was a rather lackluster visit. I hope it will be better next time.

I've eaten at many breakfast restaurants that were much better. Firstly, they do not seem to turn the tables over as quickly as I would imagine they could. We watched several tables sit empty as we waited to be seated and it seemed like they sat empty for a while. Once we were seated we were greeted promptly and the waitress was very friendly. After we placed our order it took a while to get our food. I ordered the Denver omelette and the kids ordered pancakes and a kid's meal. The Denver omelette was watery and had too much ham and vegetables that were not properly folded in to the omelette. This was an omelette where they made the eggs and then just placed the ingredients in the middle. I'm not even sure the vegetables were actually cooked. I was very unimpressed with the omelette and the potatoes were just average at best. Considering the wait to get in I don't believe I will be back anytime soon.

I went here once because I got a coupon in the mail. It was a fine experience and if I recall I got a beard trim only. It was a fast, very modern and clean.

This place frickin rocks. I can't believe the selection and how they have every video game system ever made. It brings back so many memories. You have to come here just to check it out! It's like a museum for video game lovers.

I only stopped in today for coffee and it's only their third day open. They were slammed and did a good job trying to help me even though their takeout window isn't opened yet. The one lets looked amazing as I watched them go by. I wish I wasn't so crazy about getting I my flight be because I would stopped and had one they looked so good!

This is a great place to take the kids for their haircuts. The staff is always very friendly and do a good job for a very economical price. I really like their app that allows you to checkin prior to coming and tells you how long your wait will be. This completes the experience. In summary: low price, fast, and good value.
