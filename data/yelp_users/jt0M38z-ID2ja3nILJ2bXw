Normally I couldn't fathom leaving such a negative review for a Subway as I quite enjoy eating fresh but I found this particular establishment to be most unsatisfactory.  It was relatively clean inside but there was no atmosphere whatsoever.  There was no music or anything, just utter silence.  Service was OK, two stars maybe,  but it was virtually impossible to understand the employees.   We gotta have some basic communication if we're going to do business.   Prices were definitely higher than other Subways and the veggies weren't especially fresh.  Food was acceptable but unmemorable and certainly lower quality than other locations.  If it were a small town and this was the only Subway, I guess it would be tolerable but this is Phoenix.  There's a Subway on every corner and I see absolutely no reason to visit this location ever again.  Clean up guys, tour other locations or something to see how it's done.   What you're doing isn't working at all.

I've frequented this store for many years and have always had good luck getting help from the employees.   Generally if I can't find a book, all I need to do is ask at customer service and they'll either point me in the right direction or help me to place an order for the book.   The store has a good selection of product besides books as well including comics, games, collectibles, etc.  I've never noticed the cleanliness issues that some of the other Yelpers have mentioned about this store.   Perhaps I've only shopped there on the days they cleaned?

Ordered the chicken fried steak with a cup of clam chowder.  The food was quite good though the steamed vegetables were a little bland.   Service was good and the waitress was polite.   The big problem was the long wait (Friday night in a busy area so expected).

I've eaten at a few different Red Lobsters in the valley and for the most part, I am rarely impressed.  The prices tend to be a bit high and the service tends to be only average for average food, in short a three star experience all around.     So the Red Lobster in the Metro Center area was a very pleasant improvement over that experience.   We had a great server who kept up with our needs without being annoying and the food was pretty great.   I ordered the Salmon New Orleans with mashed potatoes and was very impressed.   My one complaint is that the Bloody Mary I ordered must have had an entire bottle of Tabasco sauce in it but other than that, the meal was delicious and the service was excellent.   Other bonuses include more spacious dining areas (we didn't feel cramped even though it was pretty full, as typical for a Red Lobster) and an excellent bar area that had a few TVs with the football game on.   Very nice ambiance in the restaraunt overall.    I will definitely be making the trek out east to eat at this Red Lobster again

Came as part of a large wedding party and the service was outstanding!  We were given a private room with just enough space for the entire party.  Service, though slow because of the size of our party, was prompt and polite.   The food was excellent and the two servers made sure we had enough drinks, salad, and breadsticks.   After the great experience, I would certainly consider this Olive Garden for a function of my own.

Men's Wearhouse is a clean store with curteous clerks.  To bad they aren't diligent in their jobs.  Twice we've rented from them for events and each time there were numerous mistakes.  For the most recent event we had I ended up with scuffed shoes, no socks, and no suspenders.  My friends had numerous problems with their rentals as well.     My best advice if you decide to use them is "renter beware" and make sure everyone for your event checks their rentals to make sure that they have everything and it all matches.  In their defense, Men's Wearhouse is very polite and apologetic about their mistakes but after two events where they got things wrong, giving them another chance is a tough sell.

Chino Bandido is not the restaraunt to go to if you are looking for a healthy meal or excellent tableside service.  However, the staff is always polite and offering samples of their diverse menu is the norm.    The food is Chinese and Mexican (it goes together better than you'd think) and while the options are limited in some ways (A Chinese place without Chow Mein?) for the most part the food is very good, albeit a little greasy.    Any of the entree items can be had by itself, placed in a quesadilla, or wrapped as a buritto.   Beans and various  kinds of fried rice are offered with the main combo and the range of diversity means that you can probably find something you like, regardless of the mood you're in.    If you are looking for a place that is a little different, and aren't particularly concerned about fine dining, this is the place to go.  It can get a little crowded during the lunch and dinner rushes though as it is quite popular.

It is hard not to like this Caramba: the staff is very polite and they prepare your food quickly, even when the restaraunt is a little more crowded.  The dining room is set up well to be open and comfortable, with two large TVs that are usually tuned into sports.  There is also a small dining area outside that is smartly tucked away from the very large parking lot of this shopping center, so things don't get to noisy.   Caramba has a fairly good menu for "fast food" Mexican with fresh ingrediants that at least seem authentic.   It leaps and bounds better than other similar fast food places like Del Taco and Taco Bell and even better than some of the local sit-down Mexican restaraunts.   The prices are noticably more expensive however.   Still, the meals are quite filling and even if it seems like you aren't getting much food for your money, you will walk away full.     On more than one occassion, I've made the mistake of ordering extra tacos on the side because I was super hungry and ended up eating way to much.

The best advice that I can give is that if you plan to dine at Pappadeaux, plan to arrive early.  This place is positively packed later in the evening! Still, if you're ready to set aside the money to have a good night, you'll probably get it here.    The restaraunt is extremely customer-service oriented with very polite employees who attempt to fulfill all your needs.   They'll even offer suggestions on what items to select depending on what your party is looking for, very helpful!   On this particular trip I settled on the Crawfish Etouffee and ordered a Bloody Mary from the bar.  Between my meal and our appetizers (we went with the combo platter and pan-fried frog legs) I can say that I was totally satisfied by the end of the night.   Things were noisy but we were in the mood to relax and have fun and the atmosphere was certainly condusive to doing just that.     The food may not have been particularly authentic compared to real Cajun/Creole food but it was completely satisfying and I was surprised that my drink was relatively inexpensive for its size and for a bar inside a restaraunt in the middle of the city.   While it can get expensive fast at Pappadeaux, the folks here definitely earn their money.  The live music on the patio was certainly a plus as well.

Casa Grande Ruins National Monument was pretty impressive.  I've been to a few of the National Monuments around the state and while some of them are impressive (Montezuma's Castle), there isn't a whole lot to see.   The Casa Grande Ruins however has a real nice exhibit center when you first walk in that has examples of architecture, pottery, and local wildlife.    The entire monument is dedicated to the ancient Hohokam Native American culture (circa 1200 AD) and there are some really interesting recovered artifacts to see, including some pottery examples that are just as old as the ruins.  As a bonus, there's even a short 30 minute video that plays every half hour.     The ruins themselves are a site to see.   And unlike some of the other Native Monuments in the state, you can walk right up to them and get a great look at them.    There are plenty of informational signs on the ground too that provide some pretty interesting info on what we know (or theorize) about Hohokam life.   All that and admission is only $5 a head, so it isn't a bad way to spend a couple hours at all.    The Monument comes complete with a gift shop, though items (mostly books) are pretty expensive.  Its a shame since the shop boosted such interesting titles as a book on the Civil War in the Southwest and ghost towns of Arizona.   There's also a large picnic area that you can get to without going into the museum proper that includes an overlook where you can see the old Hohokam ball court.   The grounds are laid out well with plenty of examples of Sonoran plantlife and in the Autumn when its a bit cooler, the entire place is relatively peaceful.     A very fun trip that I'll certainly keep on the list of things to do when I'm entertaining guests from out of state.

You're certainly paying for the experience at Margarittaville.  The drinks are decent (and more reasonably priced than the food) and the food is good (but much to expensive for what you get).   The atmosphere is great though, especially if you like classic rock.   Even when the restaraunt is super busy, I find it pretty relaxing.     I've always had good service, the kind you can expect from a more expensive restaraunt.  I'm not sure if I've just been lucky or not considering some of the other reviews, but I've never had the bad service experiences other yelpers talk about.   Be sure to save up if you plan to go because realistically you're looking at $20-$30 per person, more if you plan on getting some drinks.   Still, if you like the ambiance, you'll probably have a good time.

After eating at many different Asian restaraunts, I've settled on T & J as my favorite place on the west side.   Some of the menu items are a little pricier at T & J but they more than make up for it with the extremely generous portions of food.   The menu is a little larger than at some of the other Chinese restaraunts in the Valley too which is a huge plus.  The atmosphere inside the restaraunt is nice and the servers are polite and speedy.    The restaraunt also offers good carry out service if you just want to pick dinner up for your family.  They always pack well, though some of the entree items are coated with enough sauce that your packages will leak if you aren't careful.

Gave P.F. Chang's the beef and broccoli test.  They passed.  Beef was tender and the brocoli was crisp.  The dish wasn't overly salty and had a rich flavor.  Grabbed the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer.  It was a solid order as well, though a bit salty as the name implies.  Sauces were delicious.  I wouldn't rate the food as better than a local place but it was quite excellent.  Chang's is a bit spendy compared to those local places but the service is excellent and I'm fine with paying for the experience.   Our waitress was prompt and friendly and delivered a relaxing experience overall.  The interior is a bit dark but comfortable and relaxing.  Chang's does draw crowds though so it can get a bit noisy.     Highly recommended if you're looking for a more professional experience and want to be taken care of.  Good for dates or adult friend and family outings.  The full service bar is excellent.

Oh Tilted Kilt, what can I say about you? If I claim to like the food, will anyone believe me?   The interior is nice, though it gets crowded during big sports events.   In general the menu is good, though distinctly of the fried, bar food variety.    They have some good spicy options including a fairly decent jalapeno burger that is a big winner with me.   I'm also something of a fan of their bar service.  They have a pretty decent Irish Carbomb that they call a Belfast Boom.     I won't bother talking about the waitresses since you know what kind of place this is already but in general I've always gotten good service here.   Took a friend here for a bachelor party once and the results were pretty entertaining.   We usually have a good time whenever we go but expect plenty of skeevy businessmen who come to leer at the waitresses and 20-somethings (who also come to leer at the waitresses...)     Tilted Kilt is ace in my book for having significantly better food than Hooter's and it's my go-to place if I've got some bros to entertain.  They always seem to like it.

My Big Fat Greek Restaraunt isn't the most authentic Greek place (or the cheapest) but the portions are extremely filling.   The main dining area is small, though cozy during slower hours.     The service has always been very polite and professional.  The servers are knowledgeable about their menu and willing to recommend different items on the menu, depending on what you like.  The food ranges from Greek and Greek fusion to stuff that isn't really Greek at all so even people with narrower tastes should be able to find something they like.  Some entries are a bit pricey but the portions are large and tend to be very filling.   On this trip I got th Aegean Club Sandwich, which was a very satisfying fusion between a gyro and a club sandwich.   A great restaraunt for casual groups, Big Fat Greek Restaraunt's chief drawback seems to be that it might not be the best restaraunt for an intimate meal, particularly if you are looking for more authentic Greek cuisine.

I love Leo's even if Leo's doesn't love me very much.  The portions are extremely reasonable for the prices (which don't even get that out of hand for the larger entrees).   The Macaroni salad that they offer with all of their main entrees is delicious and compared to the stuff at the store is almost impossible to beat.  To be honest, I haven't had macaroni salad this good that wasn't homemade.    The staff is polite and the service is usually fairly quick.  The dining room isn't that large and whether you eat in or not, everything is packed in take out boxes, so Leo's doesn't have the best experience for dining-in but the dining room is usually quiet which is nice.   Besides their range of Hawaiian/Pacific food offerings, Leo's also has a selection of Hawaiian drinks available.  If you've never tried Hawaiian style food, Leo's is definitly a good place to try out.   The pineapple chicken is to die for.

I've got to give Oregano's credit, the food was significantly better than I was expecting.  I've long avoided this restaurant as given it's popularity, it is always slammed with customers.   I figured that while the food was probably good, it wasn't THAT good.   We did arrive early (around 4:00 PM) to get our name in the hat and ended up enjoying a two hour wait.  In fairness to Oregano's, we were a party of 13 and they couldn't seat us until at least half the group had arrived.  No one objected to that and in this instance, I didn't mind the wait.     The outside staff was courteous and it was nice to get full drink service while we were out there.   Their beers on tap aren't outstanding, though they do have some microbrew stuff as well as the typical range of garbage beers and slightly less garbage beers so at least the liquor was drinkable.  I couldn't get a Bloody Mary though because they were "out of Bloody Mary Mix" (note to self, never order a Bloody Mary at Oregano's).   The free pizza samples were quite nice as well.     From the time we finally did get seated, to getting our food, to paying our bill, was two and half hours so in all our large group ended up spending around 4 1/2 hours at the restaurant with long waits to be seated and a long wait between ordering our food and getting our food.    Was it worth it? Ahh, the million dollar question.   As I said in the beginning of the review, I was overall pretty surprised by the quality of the food.  It was quite delicious.  I ordered an alfredo dish with shredded chicken and it was very good.  The sauce had a strong flavor without being overwhelming and Oregano's use of southwest peppers wins a gold star from me.   They get a little carried away with the herbs (to much Oregano? yes!) which gives some of the food a gritty aftertaste but overall it was excellent.     I also decided to order a full-size pizza to take home with me.  After waiting four hours, I figured it wasn't going to be anytime soon that I would venture these crowds again.  The pizza, a southwestern creation with carne asade and more poblanos was also quite good.  I love thin crust pizza so for me they have a real winner here with their basic design.   Again the use of herbs was somewhat overpowering but the taste of the pizza was fairly rock solid.   The larger pizzas are only $1-$2 more expensive than the small pizzas (though the pizzas themselves are fairly expensive overall) so after going with an 18'' I ended up with enough food to get me through the next several days.  I was quite happy about that.  Overall the experience was very positive but it was mainly made so by having a great group of friends to hang with.  Going in we knew the wait was going to be long (especially because of the size of our party) so we took it in stride and tried to enjoy the atmosphere.   The food was definitely good and the service was decent but the food was not good enough that I would be willing to brave the wait times on a regular basis.  I'm fairly sure Oregano's will go on the list of (very) infrequent special occasions.      I strongly recommend you avoid the restaraunt if you are looking for something small or intimate.     Part of the issue with this location is that they built in an old fast food joint (long-time residents of the area will recognize it as the building that used to house a Fazolli's) and the building simply isn't large enough for the crowds the food draws.  That's a shame because the restaurant easily draws enough business to support a larger building and larger staff.   Oregano's, I love you but either open more West Side locations or relocate to a larger building, until then you won't be seeing me regularly.  Though, with the business they draw, they won't be missing my money either.   Ahh well, at least the food is delicious.
