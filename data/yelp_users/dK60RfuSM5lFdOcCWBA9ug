This is my second visit here with orders from Postmates customers tonight and sometimes when they place orders we need clarification on what they are requesting. I asked Stephanie (the snotty chick working the drive thru) to hold while I figured this order out. Once I placed the order. Her comment on if I was sure that's what I wanted was not necessary. I was going to place another order for food for myself but quickly changed my mind. I'd rather give my money to another business. Hopefully I don't have to come back here tonight and if I do I hope she's not the one taking my order.

Staff is amazingly friendly. Burgers are terrific, beer is cold and I could definitely see my self coming back.

The staff inside this location is the best... always helpful and pleasant to deal with.

I will never ever, ever, ever, ever go here again. Last night I was there for Fat Tuesday celebrations. Was there for a good 4 hours, walked a few feet from the back entrance to take a phone call and when I tried coming back in they tried to charge me another cover charge. The security guy acknowledged that he seen me walk away and insisted that he could not let me in without another fee. When I asked who his boss was he refused to give that info. I had already spent a good $80 on myself there and didn't think it was right to charge me to reenter the event I had already been at and spending good money on. This experience was so bad that I will not spend another penny at this establishment. I now absolutely hate this place!!!

I love this place. I've been here a few times and have NEVER been disappointed. Food is great (try the ceviche!!) and the adult beverages are priced well. I haven't heard if anybody who doesn't like this spot. Do it! You know you wanna!

I will always choose DB over any other coffee shop. I absolutely love the service and the staff is always in a good mood. The drinks are always yummy and they give back to the community.

Service sucked. Was handed a menu to look at, but the bartender never came back to see if I wanted to order from it, had to flag her down when she was bringing someone else's food in the area, then I hate that I sat there with an empty beer glass for about 10 min wondering where she had gone. Then when I wanted to pay my tab, that was another wait. I could have easily walked out. Then I let her know I needed my tab, waited some more while I watched her stop to get someone else their beer, check her cell phone and have a brief convo with another patron all with my tab in her hand. I can honestly say I will not ever go back. I hate that I spent more of my time waiting on service than enjoying my beers. I had a friend come pick me up and offered to buy him a drink. He said no we will go somewhere else, that place has horrible service. Lmao... all before me telling him of my experience.

I actually went here yesterday. I have eaten here several times and have loves it. Yesterday we left wondering WTF happened. I wasted $40 on crap.... Literal crap. It started when I ordered. Asked for wings, were out of wings. Ok we can deal w that. Moved on to the next order. I'd like a side of green beans, oh we're out of them, ok mixed veggies, oh we're out of those too. Oh wow!!! Ok so we improvised and ordered different sides. I got fried fish that was chewy and fatty, my sons chicken strips smelled funny and had a bit of a rotten taste, my guy friends fried chicken was raw in the middle. I was annoyed. We didn't eat our food and I wasn't gonna sit there and cause a stink. I let them know directly about our problems and was offered another piece of chicken. Really? What you gave me already was inedible, why would I want more?? And another piece of chicken??? I spent $40 on stuff that went in the garbage can and a empty stomach. I WILL NEVER IN MY LIFE GO BACK TO THIS PLACE. N E V E R ! ! ! I want to know what happened. I used to love this spot. Now it nauseates me. I'm sad and pissed at the same time.

So annoying when you call an order in for pickup, given an eta of 10 min and after standing in line for the pickup counter, the cashier allows people to cut and order before assisting those in line for pickup. Then you get to the counter and your order is not there. You wait patiently and 15 min later. You still don't have your order!!!! The girl says they're wrapping it up now. 10 more minutes pass. Then you get your order. I'm picking up for someone else. I will not be coming here for myself ever.

I love this place. The carne is perfectly seasoned and the portion sizes are just right. I have worked across the street from this place for a few months and each time I eat here I am never disappointed. It is definitely worth the try. ;)

I have had a membership for a few years now and I continue to love it more each time I use it. I am a huge fan of finding cheap fun entertainment for me and my kids. I have had the opportunity to introduce them to the symphony and theater. I have gone to comedy shows, sporting events, concerts, and festivals. I tell everyone I know about it. It's an amazing deal and I will continue to be a member as long as it exists.

Cold unseasoned French fries, flavorless burgers, overly priced for what is being offered. No thanks. Never again. One and done. But the setup is a nice idea.

Most horrible service I have EVER had anywhere.  I am a Postmate courier and because I am with Postmates I'm being told that my order gets placed behind all in house orders. Beyond ridiculous because I already waited 20 minutes to place a to go order. Then I have to wait even longer. Not only is this a disservice to my customers but to me. The longer I wait, the longer it takes for me to move on to another job, which results in me making less money. I have come here as a direct customer several times. I will not be back. I also will be rejecting any Postmates requests for this establishment from here on out. I really don't get it. Our customers are your customers, they are paying for your product, they assist in keeping you in business and you treat them as if they are less than others. It's bad.

We love this place. Been here more times than I remember to check in. Staff is always friendly and I haven't yet had a bite of food to complain about. Friday and Saturday nights there's a DJ. Even brought the kids here and they always love it.
