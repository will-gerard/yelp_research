Definitely a 2 to 3 star place . I'm Mexican and know good food when it comes to it and even though we live near Mexico  it's still hard to find good Mexican food . This place was a baby step above Filabertos.. The menudo was super salty and very greasy  the salsa is mild and don't expect chips and salsa in your to go order . The chicken tacos did have quality meat, seemed to be all white chicken, but don't expect it to be a stuffed taco and the rice is bland and mushy.

What a disappointment! Shows how ya can't rely on reviews all the time  The meat pie was pretty tasty but not worth the 20min wait for it  The beef soup in the app menu was SUPER salty and the meat was Tough Yuck  Along with the dumplings not being fully cooked. My mom ordered the  Jerk chicken good tasting but not worth the price! Super skinny small breast  Of chicken served over an abundance of rice talk about  Making your money off rice. The service wasn't that great either He was nice but after getting a couple other tables he was swamped I would never recommend this place and the bathrooms are  Disgustingly dirty !

Very clean, attentive and fast! My acrylics look great very natural! A bit pricey, but I Guess if you want a good job you have to pay for it. She charged me $47 for taking off my original set, putting a new clear set on and full nail gel paint.

Best tasting sushi in the valley with great prices! The actual cocktail list is a rip off $9 for the smallest drink, Not worth the money, stick with saki! Very clean and pretty fast for a busy Saturday night, expect a wait small environment but worth the wait. They also have an excellent children's menu, my daughter loved the yakisoba chicken and veggies it was delicious. They also have a couple tv's with the football game on, Always a plus.
