Had an excellent experience! Fast service, amazing food! I had the vegetarian delight and was extremely pleased with how flavorful the plate was! Would recommend, would come again!

I come in to get my car cleaned and no one is in line. I'm excited because I know the job should be swift and adequate because I am not competing with a heavy flow of traffic. I get my car and the car has not even been vacuumed. They ask me how it looks and I ask if they're being serious. I've had trouble with this spot before and shouldn't have come back but I figured I'd give it another shot. I'll never come back here again and that's a promise. If I could give zero stars I would. On a better note they did take the car back and vacuum it but I'm still not impressed.

Everything's great, clean, staff is friendly. Would give 5 stars but hate waiting around for attendants at night to check in. Other than that, keep it up!

I loved the experience I had with Merit plumbing! Michael was very personable and I felt that I got an honest price for great work!
