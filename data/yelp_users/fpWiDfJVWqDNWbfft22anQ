You know the feeling you get when you haven't had a decent meal in what seems like days and all you want to do is break the fast with something amazing? That's the feeling I had yesterday afternoon when I foolishly decided to try La Tolteca for the first time...  Why was this a foolish decision? Because I got sick. Super duper sick. Which I should have known was going to happen because the Fish Burro I ordered tasted terrible. And now, here I am, 24 hours later, still trying to keep fluids in my body in between trips to the bathroom.  Now I know what you're thinking... "What does he expect? He ordered a Fish Burro!" And I know. You're right. It's just that I've had such good luck with fish tacos at a couple of other restaurants lately (Canteen, Tacos Atoyac) that I decided to see what sort of magic La Tolteca could create with their mahi mahi. Apparently their in-house magician has Mondays off.  I seriously don't know why there's so many four and five star reviews of this place on Yelp. It's not that great. Even if my burrito hadn't made me ill, I still would have felt compelled to write something to balance all the positive reviews on here. Maybe the corn tortillas they use on their tacos deserve the accolades that other reviewers can't seem to stop talk about, but my flour tortilla was below average. It was dry and it tasted like paper.  As for the burro, I specifically asked about the filling prior to ordering it and I was told that it only contained cabbage, fresco cheese and guacamole. Sadly, when I took my first bite, out spewed a white, mayonnaise-like substance. The burro's filling was more like a fish salad of sorts and it tasted off. Very off. And the fish wasn't hot. Actually, nothing it the burro was the least bit warm. And the guacamole was on the side--not inside the burro. But again, I was starving at this point so I took it down. Every last bite.  I knew immediately that something was wrong. I considered removing the food from my body as soon as I got outside, but I decided to keep my finger out of mouth and let things settle. Big mistake. There would be no settling. I consider myself to have an iron gut, too. I can basically eat anything in any quantity (not that I do this often) but normally I have good luck. I haven't been this sick since eating food from a middle-of-nowhere farmstand while bike touring in the Caribbean.  I'm giving La Tolteca two stars because I did like their hot sauces--all of them. And they have cheap beer, too ($2 Coronas all day, every day). However, as Michael S. noted in an earlier review, everything I tried tasted off. Tangy is fine when that's what a place is going for, but everything I ate tasted slightly tangy in a ugh-this-is-going-to-make-me-sick sort of way. Not cool.  So that's that. I really don't think I'll be back. I have no desire to explore the bakery case and there's way too many small taquerias around to take any more chances with this high-volume, supermarket of a restaurant.

English Pub theme aside, this is one great all-around bar / restaurant.  After 6 or 7 visits, no element of this place has disappointed me.  George and Dragon "feels" like it could've been one of the first pubs in Phoenix, yet I don't know how long its been around... my point is it feels great.  The service is always friendly and prompt, the crowd is always diverse, and the frequent weekend live music is a big plus.  I've felt sort of a rockabilly theme more often than not, but I have yet to make it there on a Wednesday, so I can't speak to anything but the weekend crowd.  I also heard its a good place to get some work done in the afternoon, as they offer wi-fi, too!  Cool, eh?  Pool and darts live here, too, as noted in previous reviews.  Want a great place to catch up with some out-of-town friends without being annoyed?  Go to George & Dragon!  Great vibe, great bar.

http://www.arcadiaice.com/  I discovered Arcadia Ice Arena after responding to a Craigslist ad looking for a Program Director who knew how to ice skate.  I responded, and scheduled an interview with Jim - the owner.  Let me begin by saying by Jim is one of the most inspirational and community-minded people I've ever met - and I've met quite a few.  He began working at the arena as a young teen, and continued to do so while he pursued his college degree in Accounting.  He went on to play pro hockey, winning a championship, and returned to the arena after a spending a short time as an accountant - because Arcadia Ice Arena means everything to him.  Plain and simple - this place is still open because Jim loves hockey and he knows creative accounting.  He pours his heart and soul into this arena, and employs teens that could use a little mentoring.  Arcadia is lucky to have him.  Yeah - the facilities are a little rough around the edges but that's hockey.  Jim showed me locker room repairs he'd made just a few days prior, explaining to me that its an impossible task to keep kids from smashing hockey sticks into everything; as a former child skater, I can relate wholeheartedly.  Anyway, here's the best part.  At the rear of the arena, tucked behind the buildings, is my favorite bar in all of Phoenix.  Its a little divey, but its something special.  There's a few games, a free-standing fireplace, along with cold beer and an always-friendly bartender.  Behind her is a wall of glass, allowing you to watch the action on the rink from your bar stool.  I've never seen anything like it, and I guarantee you haven't either.  Its a must-visit.  One more thing: Jim is open to any event or gathering that you could possibly dream up.  We talked about doing some roller-rink style parties come late spring, so stay tuned!

One of the disadvantages of being a lean, tall guy that likes to stay in shape is that it is absolutely impossible to find clothes that fit.  My neck is small, and my arms are long, so I have no choice but to have my clothing either custom-manufactured or altered.  Artful Tailoring is on point in all regards.  The owner, Aladdin Dimas, a native of Damascus, Syria, has been learning the trade since he was 14.  He knows cool, and he knows how to accentuate the best and worst parts of the human figure.  His prices are very fair, and his textile collection is world-class.  Go check him out.  He's put together an above-average website which you can access by clicking on the above link to the business' info, and I suggest you do so.  In the market for a new shirt?  Don't settle for a 'fitted' Kenneth Cole... go give Aladdin a shot!  He'll make you look like a million bucks!

Great Sandwich!  I was treated to "free lunch" yesterday after agreeing to an impromptu Sunday afternoon business meeting, and I was happily surprised when I was told that, among my choices strewn on the table, was a Prickly Pear sub from a mystery establishment known as Flancer's.  The bread was perfect - and this is coming from someone who pretty much altogether stopped eating sandwiches 5 or so years ago due to the consistent let-down of most breads.  The crust was nice and crusty, fresh as can be, and didn't overwhelm the rest of the sandwich.  I wish I knew everything that comprised this Chicken n Prickly Pear concoction, but I don't - I was too busy.  All I know is it tasted great, and it made up for the fact that I was dedicating my Sunday afternoon to a round table discussion that did not include an outdoor activity.  Good work, Flancer's!  You made my first trip to Gilbert a great one!

http://www.azpuppets.org/  Adult Puppet Slam = My favorite thing to do in Phoenix.  "Quirky, edgy puppet shows by Arizona's leading quirky, edgy puppeteers."  I've been to the last three Adult Puppet Slams, and they just keep getting better and better.  The writing is intelligent, and the puppetry is as creative as puppetry can get.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of stand-up comedy, especially of the 'dirty just for the sake of being dirty' variety, and these Adult Puppet Slams are right up my alley.  Before my first visit, I expected rude and crude humor (since the shows are 21 and over) and I couldn't have have been more surprised.  The shows are 'Late Night with Conan O'Brien' quality, and the theater itself - an old Mormon church - is worthy of a visit just for its architectural wonderfulness.  They serve cheap drinks, the shows are full-feature length, and the lobby doubles as the country's premier puppet museum.  Two notes:  A) The shows are growing in popularity.  Buy your tickets in advance.  B) The Adult Puppet Slams seem to pop up unexpectedly on the theater's schedule.  Visit their website monthly, or else you'll miss the show announcement.

I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this review, because others have summed it up pretty well.  I like that I can score with one drink special or another most regularly, but I wish the music was better - but I say that about everywhere I go, so I'm not gonna hold it against them.    The staff's friendly more often than not, and the food is decent.  I like going on Tuesday's for fish tacos.  I think they're like 7 or 8 bucks, and you get three of them.  They're big, too.  And they come with chips and salsa.  Good stuff, overall.  This place has so much more potential, though...  If only they had a real jukebox.  I should note that for those of you who haven't been down there in a while - they've expanded the patio and its pretty righteous.  A nice place to grab an outdoor couch for a Sunday brunch.  Get there before 8:30 or 9 at night, though, when you go... otherwise you'll most likely be paying a cover charge.  Even on most Wednesdays or Thursdays.  See ya there!

I know I give more four star reviews of establishments than I probably should, and I'm trying to break myself of the habit, but Los Olivos deserves a solid four stars in my book.  Like others have said, the food isn't over-the-top amazing, but its solid Mexican and its solid consistent.  I've had enchiladas (fantastic), fajitas (fantastic), and multiple times, the guacamole (fantastic).    What is over-the-top is the architecture, the character, and the somewhat-rustic feel to the slightly-wacky dining room(s).  While it is not completely clear from the exterior of the Los Olivos structure, the interior reveals a Xanadu of sorts, no ceiling angle alike, no wall length perpendicular to another.  Floor tiles show signs of decades of foot traffic, and chairs reveal evidence of many meals enjoyed.  In a town where most establishments are half the age of your favorite pair of jeans, I find the comfort of Los Olivos to put me at ease.  On the weekends make sure to arrive early, or you will be asked to wait for what could be more than an hour, and its not a comfortable place to sit and have a drink while waiting, so plan accordingly.  If you like Mariachi music, give them a call ahead of time and find out when the strumming goes down.  My last time there the band set up within arms length of our table, and while some might have found this to be annoyingly distracting, my party used it as a great excuse to kill the small talk and let the guitars, vocal chords, and flavours do the talking...  Los Olivos = Love the Place.  Mexican Food = I would marry it if I could.

Consistency and high-quality.  This is Malee's on Main.  They don't skimp on the vegetables, and the when you ask for hot - you get hot, no ifs, ands, or buts about it.  Their tofu is always prepared with excellence, and the chicken never dry or tasteless.  All the curries shine, but the Arizona Heat Wave (red curry) is fabuloso.  The restaurant itself is cozy, too.  Low ceilings, fun and interesting table placement - Malee's uses the uniqueness of their space to their full advantage.  I've never felt like I've intruded on anyone's conversation by accident, nor have I ever felt it happen to me.  The lunch special is a good deal, however it can be busy, so make sure you have the time.  I've been to Malee's on several occasions when a group comes in at 12:30 or 1, and then I can tell their upset because they're food doesn't come out with the speed of a drive up window.  This always bothers me.  Good food takes time, and Malee's is most definetly very good - so allow them the time to prepare it.  You'll be glad you did-

I love the House of Rice.  The prices are great, and I can get frozen Kafir Lime Leaves, as well as shelled edamame for a fraction of the cost of any other shop in town.  They've got an amazing selection of knives, as well as enough different kinds of chopsticks to make your head spin.  They have Pocky (those addicting little stick-cookies, for those of you who don't know) as well as many different kinds of rice cracker mixes.  They also have cheap coconut milk, as well as Mae Ploy Curry Paste - my favorite.  Oh - and they have spring roll wrappers - for a quarter of the price of AJ's.  Plus, they're fresh.  I'm sure there's other Asian markets in town, but The House of Rice is basically across the street from me - and for that I give them 4.5 stars.  That and I love their greeting cards, wall hangings, and generally great selection of trinkets.  The staff's nice, too.  One note: They don't stay open very late - 6:30 during the week, 6 on Saturday, and 4 on Sunday - so plan accordingly.

Updated 4/13/2008  I've been back to Tottie's three times since I first reviewed it, and its gotten better with every single visit.  Tonite was no exception.  Panang Curry: Must have if you do curry.  The vegetables are cut with care, and done to perfection.  Bamboo shoots, squash, and all. Tofu is great.  Chicken is fantastic, too.  The beautifully grown basil garnish could be the best part, too.  I love basil, and if you do too - you're in luck.  Tonight my basil was purplish green with a dusting of silver.  Pad Kra Pao: Must have, too.  Stir fried chicken w/Thai basil in chili sauce, onions, red bell peppers & bamboo shoots.  Again, the vegetables were sliced and prepared with great care.  Excellent fragrance. Large portion.  Edamame. 3 bucks & change.  Always nice.  Do yourself a favor, too - and get the ice cream.  Tonight there were 10 custom flavors.  Peanut Butter, Lychee, Ginger, Apricot... can't remember them all. Our choice: Avocado.  Out of this world.  And the wafer? To die for.  As Roland W. recently wrote, I'm still somewhat up in the air, too, but tonite's performance may have convinced me that Tottie's is figuring out their new groove, and gettin' it.  I'll be back - for sure.  And every other time it's gonna be the Panang, too...    (Below is my earlier review posted from earlier this year: 2/08/2008)  Also going to mention that this place was formerly known as Shanghai Palace.  Same owners, new restaurant is twice the size.  So what is Tottie's take on Asian Fusion?  Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai.  Not really fusion, though... They just have a large menu that includes all four different cuisines.  While I've only visited once, and it was for lunch, I was disappointed to discover that the lunch specials are limited to Chinese dishes.  I went in hoping for Thai and had to settle for Kung Pao Chicken.  Additionally, there was only one vegetarian option on the lunch menu, and there are few veg options on the regular menu.  I will say that the lunch portion was well above-average in size, and it was good, however the hot and sour soup was a little iffy...  In conclusion, I'm looking forward to giving Tottie's another shot for some Thai food, but I won't be returning for the lunch special anytime soon... nice place, though!  And the owner is nice, friendly, and approachable!  Cheap for lunch, too!... if you like-a the meat.

As someone who has profound respect for anyone who is able to design, alter, or repair articles of clothing, I'm constantly on the look out for reputable, friendly, establishments that can not just do the work, but also establishments I enjoy supporting.  Fifth Ave Alterations is most definitely one of those establishments.  Great care was taken not just in measuring me for the alterations I needed, but I was also dissuaded from wasting my money on costly vintage suit adjustments that may or may not have been successful.  I appreciated the honesty, and took their advice, as those suit alterations would have been 3 to 4 times what I actually paid for the suit - something that was made clear to me.  I did, however, have two pairs of vintage slacks altered for length, and the results were superb.  Just be sure to bring cash, as you need to pay for your alterations up front, and credit cards are not accepted.

I saw Dr. Linder in mid 2008 to seek treatment for a case of perioral dermatitis that was irritating me as a result of nearly three years of daily sunblock applications to the face, as I was living in the mountains of California, outdoors every day.  I tried to solve the problem myself using natural treatments, therefore I brought in all the products I had tried and Dr. Linder took time to assess them.  She was very thorough in her approach, and while the office was busy that day, I could tell she was paying close attention to me during my appointment.  I was given a prescription for my ailment, which I decided to change when I discovered its cost, and Dr. Linder's office responded to my phone request immediately.  All in all, I was very pleased with my first visit to a dermatologist.  Dr. Linder took the time to fully understand my problem and as a result, my problem disappeared quickly.  I could tell she's done a great deal of personal research about alternative therapies and she was very receptive in her feedback regarding everything I had tried prior to my visit.  All in all - great experience.

:::::PROS:::::  Clean, clean, clean.  The cooking environment, the floor, the condiment area, the tables - all spotless.  Cheap, cheap, cheap.  Most burritos are in the 3-dollar range, and you can't beat the quality for the price.  The chicken burrito incorporated medium spicy shredded chicken done just right, and the breakfast burrito used eggs, ham, cheese, onions, and green peppers to get it done.  Breakfast served all-day!  I know other Mexican restaurants do the same, but given the fact Fiesta Burrito is tantalizingly tasty, it just sweetens the deal.  Great Pico De Gallo, and Red Sauce at the condiment bar!  Need I say more?  :::::CONS:::::  None.  Fiesta Burrito is nice and bright on the inside, and so seemed it's staff.  I believe the crew were truly enjoying themselves the day I went in and the smile on the man's face while washing the floor was refreshingly genuine and sincere.  Its obvious that its a well-run establishment, but its also one of those places that makes me wonder because the food IS so cheap...  Seriously.  How can places like J in the Box and McD's sell Chicken Sammies for a buck?  And the three dollar burrito?  I just can't see the profit margin...  But then again, I've never run a restaurant.  I mean - Fiesta's ingredients can't be that cheap, right???  Regardless, Fiesta Burrito is great bargain, and the food that I've tried so far knocked my socks clean off.  Check it out.

Maybe its because I spent several summers of adolescent life landscaping around southeastern Wisconsin, or maybe its because I spent just as much time in trees growing up as I did on the ground, but for whatever reason, some of the first establishments I tend to explore when visiting or moving to a new place are the local nurseries.  From the very first day I arrived in Arizona, meandering down Hayden Road with nothing but a street number to a place of residence in my hand, Harper's Nursery caught my eye, however it would be several weeks until I would poke my head inside.  When I did, though, was I ever surprised - and impressed.  One thing I've learned about xeriscape (the term for landscaping and gardening in ways that reduce or eliminate the need for supplemental irrigation) is that it isn't easy - but it isn't impossible, either - and Harper's is the place to go to learn how.  Not only have they been around longer than any other nursery in the valley, they grow their own trees and plants right here in the valley which, for anyone that knows anything about planting, makes all the difference in the world for the survival of a desert shrub or tree.  Their stock is acclimated to the desert climate, which you won't find at your Home Depots or Lowes, which allows for a much better survival rate once you put your acquisitions in the ground.  Their associates are absolute experts, there's a coffee shop on site, they sell the New York Times, and the nursery itself is part educational display, part botanical garden, part English Breakfast nook, and part inspirational oasis.  Their landscape stock is some of the most beautiful I've ever seen in a nursery, and I guarantee you'll spend at least an hour, if not longer, learning about how far you can stretch a few $100 bills during your first visit.  They frequently have unadvertised sales, and they're always willing to work out a deal.  They do offer reasonably priced delivery services as well as installation services for those who don't want to get their hands dirty, too.  Just a note: if you do buy something, make sure to buy a soil test kit and some soil preparation/fertilizer.  Ask a few questions, too.  They make things easy to understand, and you'll find yourself empowered to keep your purchases alive and well for many years - if not decades - to come.

If the day ever comes when I make the decision to tie the knot with a special someone, you can bet I'll be pushing hard for The Wisconsin Memorial Union Terrace.  Its simply amazing.  It would be impossible to put into words the many great experiences I had at the Terrace, so here's just a sampling:  -They have a winter carnival!  Ice golfing, Ice sculpting, and kegs!  -Hoofers.  Nuff said.  Jackson Hole, Sailing Club - nobody does it like Hoofers.  -Tabbouleh, Hummus, the baked goods - all tremendous.  -Der Rathskeller!  Architectural wonder.  I adore you, Memorial Union Terrace...  Thank you for all that you've done for me.  I'll see you in August...

I have only but a few things that I absolutely NEED to remember everyday before I jet off for work, and one of those things is my coffee mug.  Typically I leave it in my car, but lately I've been pushing myself to bike the 11 miles in the morning, so its been coming inside with me at night.  Well, Wednesday I forgot my mug...  Therefore I figured it would be a good reason to try Inza!  I rolled in around 7:30 am, a good hour before I needed to get to my destination, so I had a chance to sit and sip for a while, taking it all in.  I was happy with the atmosphere.  There was a group of six or so men sitting in the back, commenting on recent news - specifically about the big money horse auction that just took place.  You don't see this in every coffeeshop, I might add, so I was very pleased with the 'life' in there.  The staff was lively, as well.  The three baristas were goofing around when I approached the counter - which I like - but quickly responded to me when I stepped up to order.  The girl that helped me was bright and cheery, and the men at her sides were equally as chipper.  Good energy, all around.  As for the space, its unique and it works.  To fill the massive void of space in the ceiling, they've constructed a hanging roof of small timbers and painted metal sheeting that provides for a nice feel.  The signage is bright, clear, and uses elegant, yet easy to read fonts - a big plus in my book.  Also unique was the coffee condiments area.  It's located at the rear of the shop - out of the way of commotion - and it includes more than your standard issue.  Cinnamon, vanilla, honey, stevia sweetener, and three types of milk/cream are offered.  There's also two very handy platforms that extend out slightly, allowing the customer to set their drink in a dedicated area, eliminating those instances when you have to clear an area for your coffee just to splash some cream in it.  Genius.  All in all, I really like this place and I'll definitely be back.  The only negative comment I have is that you are not given a free cup of coffee when you buy their mug.  I've purchased "house cups" at many independent coffee shops around the country, and I've always been offered a free fill up with my initial purchase.  Not only that, the mugs are very low quality, and the Inza logo scrapes right off.  But at least they offer a house cup, which is more than I can say about most coffee shops...  If you're in the neighborhood, give Inza a try!  You can't see it from Shea, though.  Its behind Maloney's.  Its the first shopping center west of the 101, and North of Shea.  Look for the Hummers parked out front in the morning (there was 3 the morning I stopped in)... WTF???  Scottsdale cracks me up.  Everyday.

Just read Korina A's review.  She's puts it best.  The service was fine; its just that the food sucked.  Bad.  And the wine list is way too pricey to not even list what the hell they're serving when you order a cab.  Garbage.   Just stay away.

The Clubhouse is a great place to see a show - end of story.  One star for traffic flow.  One star for a functional, circular bar that's accessible by nearly all of its 360 degrees.  One star for being an 18 and older club that also serves booze.  One star for giving great bands a fun, accomodating, and electric place to play.  Additionally, the merchandise table is fairly easy to get to and the stage is intimate yet still elevated enough so that even my shorter friends can still typically find a decent spot to see the action.  The only downfall is that the ventilation seems to be poor - but that's what happens when you pack hundreds of sweaty bodies under one roof...  Its part of the experience, right?  All in all - great place.

I stopped by the Huauchinango Mexican Grill about two weeks ago on a Saturday morning around 10am, as I was hoping to be able to score a breakfast burrito of some sort but I would not find one on the menu.  What I did find was a bustling restaurant of smiling faces cheerfully speaking a language that I wish I knew better, chomping away on large plates of food, some dishes recognizable, some not.  Since I was already in the mood for this aforementioned burrito, I decided to order a little lunch sampler for later in the day which included one of each of their three tamales, in addition two tacos, pescado and carnitas - all of which were absolutely fantastic!  There is a sauce bar with three very different and very tasty salsas, too - all available for takeout.  I will note that the entire menu is in Spanish with very few things in English, but if you have any experience with Mexican food at all, you will have no problem navigating this extraordinary menu.  I can't wait to go back!

Go Green with a.k.a. green.  You'll be glad you did.  I can't emphasize enough how expert the staff at a.k.a. green really is.  They test every single product they sell (and don't sell) and that's amazing.  a.k.a.Green co-founder Mick Dalrymple helped start the Arizona Chapter of the U.S. Green Building Council and now serves on the national Board of the organization.  Additionally, he worked with a task force to update the Scottsdale Green Building Program's residential checklist, which launched in September, 2006.  Currently, he's advising the national council on developing a single, all-encompassing green certification for products - something the industry (and customers) desperately need.  I had the opportunity to hear Mick speak at one of Scottsdale's Green Building Lectures, and I came away with two pages of notes, as well as a newfound love for clay paints and cork flooring.  You get what you pay for at a.k.a. green, so if you're remodeling, be sure to check it out.  You'll find deals, too, sometimes.  The last time I was down there, there was probably 25 gallons of beautiful clay paint for half price.  Cork flooring is cheaper than you think, too... much cheaper.  Seriously.  This is one of the best green products dealers in the nation - if not the world.  Check it out.

The odds are that if you're a yelper, and you've motored up Hayden Rd. in Scottsdale and passed Harper's Nursery, you've noticed the L.E.D. powered 'open' sign shaped like a coffee cup hanging in the window...  It took me a few weeks to get down there and investigate, but one day I decided to give it a shot, as I had some busy work to get done, and I wanted to go somewhere besides Jamaican Blue or Orange Table - my  usual stops.  What I discovered was Oscar's Coffee Bar.  Tucked in near the entrance to Scottsdale's last family-owned and operated nursery, one will find a java joint like no other in the valley.  While it might not be the sort of place you want to meet a snooty high profile client or present a portfolio, it is absolutely the sort of place to go when you want to sit down with a cup of expertly-roasted coffee in a garden-like setting that almost makes one feel like they're on sabbatical in Central America.  Inside the coffee shop itself, there is a fun assortment of musical instruments including a piano, a few guitars, as well as a small amplifier and microphone - in addition to gardening information galore.  There's also a nice vintage Pioneer stereo that's usually playing something good.  All in all, its a great place.  The nursery itself feels more like a park than a place of business, and there are nearly a dozen little benches, chairs, and the like sprinkled throughout the yard.  The staff is superb, and its one of those places where everything is for sale - including the chairs you sit on and the tables you park your latte.  In conclusion, support this business.  And if you're buying seeds, plants or trees, buy them at Harpers.  They won't die like the ones you buy at Lowe's and Home Depot.  Why?  Because Harper's grows most everything they sell, and its acclimated to the desert.  They'll tell you how to plant what you buy, and they'll make sure you have everything you need.  They'll even put it in the ground for you if you so wish... for a fee.  Once again, pleasantly surprised with this one...  Pay them a visit!  I mean, where else in the valley can you sip a mocha and peruse a greenhouse at the same time?

When I moved to Scottsdale in October of '07, I toyed with the idea of doing some personal training.  I had just gotten certified at my old gym in Madison, WI - the Monkey Bar Gymnasium - as a 'Natural Trainer', so I set out looking for a place where I might fit in.  After talking to all the major gyms, as well as a handful of smaller ones, the guys at Peak Performance Personal Training were the ONLY guys I felt comfortable working with.  They - Tony and Dan - work out of a smallish studio / gym in Arcadia, and to make a long story short - they're awesome.  They're real, they're fun, and they'll make sure that you accomplish any goal you set out to.  The studio is comfy, the music doesn't get beamed in on a satellite, and there's a park across the street that they like to use for workouts.  They'll work around your schedule, and they'll help you look and feel great.  I still plan on working with them in the future, but I'm a little too busy to do so at the moment... however I'm not too busy to recommend them - and I recommend them highly.

I know its gonna sound a bit foolish when I divulge that I was actually a bit scared to enter the Roadrunner Lounge, but the truth is that I was.  Due to its lack of windows and barebones facade, I concluded that this bar had the possibility of being the sort of place where, when I opened the door, I might bare witness to a mob boss or two trying to decide what they should do with the man they just shot...  but that wasn't the case.  What I discovered was a long corridor flanked by mirrored walls and strings of multicolored lights, as well as ample seating and classic video games to boot.  The games included PacMan and Golden Tee, accompanied by a dartboard and a pool table - enough to keep the gamer in any of us busy for at least a few hours of drink-sippin.  The drinks were cheap and strong, and the tunes were decent - however the digital jukebox put a frown on my face; I hoped for a Wurlitzer.  Our barkeep was friendly and efficient, and our drinks were strong and low-priced.  I think tap beer's only two bucks, and mixers aren't too much more.  In conclusion, the next time you're feeling a bit nostalgic, and you're looking for a watering hole off the beaten path, kick a few back at the Roadrunner.  Bottom's up!

I read about Crust Pizza and Wine Cafe just a few days ago in this month's issue of 944 magazine, and immediately I was excited to give a try.  The article pointed out that the owner, Mike Berindino, grew up in Long Island, and he learned pizza tossing from his father who owns a couple of small pizzerias in New York.  I wasn't extraordinarily hungry, so I just grabbed a slice of Spinach and Broccoli (only $2.50!)  It hit the spot and I'll definitely be back.  The interior is brand-spankin' new and modern, which I liked, and the lighting was calming, however the chairs were a bit hard and uncomfortable for my liking... but I digress.  I could've done without the damn flat-screen, too,  but I gave up on caring about TV's in restaurants long ago.  Why does every business need one, though?  Interesting enough, the salads are served in bowls made of crust, but I have yet to try one - I just saw it on the menu.  Their website is www.crustscottsdale.com, and I recommend you check it out.  I plan on going back soon to give the Rustica a try, as well as sample some vino, at which time I'll bring a friend so I won't be so critical...  Nice place, though!  Maybe a little too nice...

Just scroll down and read Jackie S.'s review.  I experienced the same service.  There's just better places to go for sushi; don't waste your time with this one.  It's on a lame and fast street corner, too, and the view / activity is non-existent.  You've got better things to do than sushi @ Pearl...  Seriously.

I find it peculiar how mixed the review's are on Pattie's 1st Ave Lounge...  The only reason I don't give it five stars is because they don't have tap beer; if they did, this would be a definite five-star establishment in my book - for what it is, and what it is is a dingy party bar.  It is a party bar that reminds me a mid-sized, small-town Wisconsin dive bar where there's always someone drinking, always someone smoking, and always someone shooting pool or playing shuffleboard - all things you can do at Pattie's.  I've probably been to Pattie's at least 20 times in the 1.5 years I've lived in Scottsdale, and every time has been equally as different and equally as entertaining.  I've reunited with Wisconsin college friends there and I've met successful business owners there.  I've danced with old women and drunk-as-a-skunk Sombrero-wearing amigos, as well as cougars and girls in their twenties wearing heels and tight skirts, and never have I ever witnessed anyone who was not having a good time.  Sure, Pattie's is not for everybody, but it is for anybody.  Pattie's does not discriminate, nor does Pattie's incriminate; its a place to get wasted and its a place to blow off steam.  Every town needs a place that allows one to lose their inhibitions with reckless abandon while listening to disco favorites and top 40 hits alike, and thank god Scottsdale has it in Pattie's Lounge.  Sure, I'm not going to go to Pattie's more than 2 or 3, maybe 4, times in a month, but when I need her, she's there, and for that I am thankful.  There's a fireplace, too, along with a beer pong table, ceilings full of ancient lights, strobes, and disco balls, as well many different perches to set one's beer.  Its a place to wear your hoodie in winter and drink your beer with gloves, and a place to wear your skimpiest cutoffs in the summer, and let the sweat run down your face.  As for the one-star reviewers of Pattie's - I agree with much of what they say.  Is Pattie's disgusting? Sure, a little bit.  Are the drinks sometimes crappy?  Sure.  But aren't all of us a little disgusting and crappy sometimes?  I know I am - and that's when I go to Pattie's to get my drink on.

You know, I don't go out of my way to hit up Los Cerritos, however I make sure to stop if I'm hungry and I happen to be in the vicinity.  Just yesterday I had an Egg, Potato, Bean and Cheese burrito for about 4 bucks and it was well above average.    It wasn't too greasy, and the eggs were even fried (as opposed to scrambled) and fried is what I prefer - score.  The tortilla was very fresh, and thinner rather than thicker.  it was a good weight, and it took a good 7 or 8 minutes to prepare even though the place wasn't busy - which is good because it means I'm most likely not going to get sick later due to undercooking; I'm always suspect when I get things too fast.  Also worth noting, the man behind the counter was very friendly and thorough, and accommodated a special vegetarian request I had - hold the bacon, add beans.  Service with a smile always makes me happy:)

You know, I gave this place another try and I don't think I'll be going back.  My burrito was greasy in a not-so-good way, which should not have been the case considering there was nothing in there that should've caused this.  As much as I'd like to give these guys a chance to change my mind again, I don't think I can do it - mainly because there is no pride in keeping the dining area tidy.  Its the least a burrito joint with a 15x15 dining area can do.

I was on the search for Specialized "Armadillo" road bike tires when I discovered Landis Cyclery.  They're the most puncture-resistant tires in the world, and you can score a set for 60-90 dollars depending on the size at Landis.  The next time you buy tires: buy some.  You'll get years of service out of them.  They're not too heavy, either.  They've also got an above-average selection of shoes, bags, and other bike goodies, too.  And its not about quantity at this shop, either; its about quality.  The brands they sell are the best in the biz and the staff is knowledgeable.  They've got the best selection of Specialized accessories I've found in the valley, and their light selection is great, as well.  There's definitely deals to be found at Landis - such as a $280 full face helmet for $100.  I also like that the shop isn't tucked away in the back of the shop; its basically right at the front desk.  In short, you'll never be neglected when you're ready to make your purchase.  Great shop!

I never had a chance to stop into this structure back when it was the Union Bar, however I couldn't imagine it being anything close to what it is now as The Mission.  Upon entry, my date and I were cordially greeted by two very attentive hostesses who promptly showed us to our table after shuffling just a bit since we did not have reservations.  Our table was a bit tight, as we were seated against the wall, but it made no difference as both of the two groups that were seated next to us throughout the nite were cordial and polite, not affecting our dining one bit.  Our entrees were spectacular, and the side order of grits was a stand-out.  The table side guacamole was smooth (and plentiful) and the service, outstanding - almost too outstanding, as I think I was asked if I was finished with my meal about 5 times before I actually was, however I'll take too attentive service over the opposite any day.  At the end of the night, too, the manager was going around pouring small shots of a very fine tequila, just to give the remaining diners a taste and talk about the New Year's tasting menu they'd be serving.  He was a joy to talk to, and his personality was genuine - something that isn't always the case here in the valley (or anywhere, for that matter).  Lastly, I love the positioning of both the bar as well as the tables in the entire restaurant.  It flows well, its comfortable, and I will absolutely be going back.

I located Dr. Levins via my health provider's physician listings.  I did a search for doctors within 5 miles of my home zip code of 85251 and it returned nearly 500 results, and when that happens - I look for a Wisconsinite.  While Dr. Levins may have not grown up in Wisconsin, he earned his degree at the Medical College of Wisconsin, and that was enough for me.  For the record, this strategy of locating Wisconsin-trained physicians hasn't failed me yet - in any region of the country I've lived in.  I know its a funny way of locating doctors, but I'm a funny guy...  The purpose of my visit was very general, as I hadn't had a basic checkup in a long time, however Dr. Levins was thorough - more thorough than any doctor I've visited has been in a very long time.  We spent a great deal of time just talking - about my prior medical history, my current lifestyle habits, as well as my overall mind-body state.  He shared personal insight as we discussed my health, and I found it extremely helpful.  I will be keeping Dr. Levins as a primary care physician as long as keep myself in this valley.  He is someone I know I can trust, and he is a great listener.  He goes into great detail when discussing physiology, and answered all my questions in an easy-to-understand manner - which many physicians don't do, or do with great reluctance.  As of this review, Dr. Levins is accepting new patients.  If you need a doctor in the Old Town Scottsdale area, give him a try.

OK. So I'm not giving this Filiberto's five stars simply because it's a Filiberto's. But I'm giving it four stars because (after two visits) it seems to be consistent, clean and pretty damn awesome.  After numerous disappointing visits to other valley Filiberto's because of gross amounts of meat in my country burritos and incorrect orders, I decided to give this location a try because I recently started working nearby. I'm diggin it.  The country burritos are near-perfect and the hot sauce is always fresh. It's always well-staffed, too.  BONUS: They have different 99 cent specials every day of the week, and you can choose any of them on Friday!  I'm still going to remain skeptical of most other Filiberto's locations, but I'd say this one is going to see my at least twice / week for a while (for better or worse). I need my hot sauce fix! What can I say?

I dropped in here one afternoon when looking for a Thai place on Yelp. I'm never in this part of town so I wanted to give some new place a shot. And I'm so happy Thai Buffet was the place I selected.  It was around one in the afternoon when we dropped in and we were promptly greeted. We were quickly offered the buffet but I explained that my companion and I rarely eat meat, and we wanted to order something different. The owner asked if we liked shrimp (which we do) and she offered to make us something special that we would like. Without knowing anything else about what might arrive at the table, I took her word for it and let her work her magic.  She came back with two plates filled with asparagus and very meaty, medium to large sized shrimp. Everything was cooked perfectly. And the sauce was beyond wonderful. We told her we like "thai hot" and we received something that was the perfect blend of flavor and heat.  We were given soup to start and we were also offered to try anything on the buffet - even though we didn't order it. The buffet looked great but neither of us had the space in our bellies to try anything after finishing what we "ordered." As others have mentioned, the desert that was delivered to us was simply amazing.  I can honestly say that Thai Buffet gave the two of us the highest quality, best tasting and best value of a meal we've ever had in Phoenix - and anywhere in the country, for that matter. We will definitely be back.

Tacos Atoyac is out of this world. And a total deal.  The menu is Oaxacan-style mexican; therefore, things might be a little different than you're used to.  The tacos, at $1, are served street-style with two small corn tortillas. Fish tacos (not yet on the menu) will set you back a mere $1.50.  The quesadilla, at $1.50, is unlike the quesadillas you're used to, but it's wonderful. It almost looks like a turnover pastry, but filled with queso cheese and covered in lettuce, cojita cheese and crema. Excellent.  My favorite item on the menu is the $2 milueta ($3 with meat). It's almost like a mini french bread pizza covered in the same ingredients as the the quesadilla: spiced black beans, queso and cojita cheese, lettuce and crema. They make the bread in-house and it's a must-try.  While I haven't tried it yet, tonight I saw a Tlayuda (pronounced "clayuda") come out of the kitchen and it looked tremendous. It was described to me as a mexican pizza of sorts, only served on a large, fresh tortilla that is crisped by a technique that basically dehydrates the freshness out of it. You can get it without meat for $6, with meat for $8.  Everything is served with a nice little side of grilled onions and a jalapeno. You can tell an amazing amount of talent, effort and fresh ingredients go into everything that comes out of the kitchen in this restaurant and I'll be going back frequently. Check it out!!!

Yesterday I finally had a chance to try the Tlayuda and it was everything that I imagined and more. The 12" round tortilla that it is served on is light, thin and crisp, and the light cheese and avocado is perfect! Between the two of us, one meatless Tlayuda and two fish tacos was just right.
