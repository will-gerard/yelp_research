Great customer service, fantastic food, and they deliver! You wouldn't believe the amount of chicken they put in their green chili burrito, and chicken salad. Their hot sauce is just like my families, spicy and flavorful, yum!

Amazing! Warm family feel and wonderful attentive staff. I asked for a custom cocktail and was told "no problem". Great job!

What an amazing hidden gem!  Great food, service and extremely inexpensive considering the A+ quality of the food.  I highly recommend you try the hummus plate, it's better than any Greek or Mediterranean place in the Valley. They also do a fantastic catering platter for those working lunches.

I have been a Plush customer since day 1 of opening their doors in Mesa.  I have watched a new small business turn into a sucessful, well oiled machine!  All of the girls are friendly, professional all the while making you feel like you are part of their family. The salon itself is gorgeous and well manicured with dark stone and warm paint, not something you would expect to find in East Mesa.   I am proud to support this local small business and wish it continued success.

We have been waiting for years for someone to open up a new spot in the old HT location.  Finally gave it a go last week for happy hour.  Great drink specials and the food on the menu sounded great but wasn't going to stick around after the service we received at the bar.  The woman who waited on us was pushy and rude.  I really do hope this local business recognizes the potential it has.  I think it could be great with the right staff and attitude.

I was nursing a broken foot and in dire need of a massage after weeks of walking around in a boot.  I called up to make an appointment and find out cost, and was able to get scheduled that afternoon.  I decided I would get the massage done first before deciding if I wanted to become a monthly member, and was I blown away!  The therapist Tomas, was wonderful and was very sympathetic to my broken foot!  I told my husband about how great the massage was and how nice the staff was.  He scheduled for the next day and now we are both members.  I have been with them for 4 months and have never been disappointed! Great work Elements!

Kimi has been my go to lash girl for over 6 years! Her lashes look so natural and have longevity (unlike some others). Her salon is comfortable, and it's easy to relax while in her hands :)

Kimi has been my go to lash girl for over 6 years! Her lashes look so natural and have longevity (unlike some others). Her salon is comfortable, and it's easy to relax while in her hands :)  Update June 2016 - just wanted to address the question about lash damage. I've been getting lashes with Kimi for 8 years, and never have experienced any lash damage. They are still as full, and as long as they were before.
