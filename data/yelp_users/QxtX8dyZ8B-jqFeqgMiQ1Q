Pretty good, actually.  Green chile burger and chicken strips with gravy both tasted good.  Very friendly service.  Recommended.

Stopped in to buy a couple bags of ice.   Counter person said they didn't have any. Spoke with a manager who said sometimes they have it and sometimes they don't.  No one wanted to bag any.

Really good NY pizza.  Lunch special for $5 is a deal for the quality of the food.  2 big slices and a soda.  Will be back for sure.

Really tasty old school Sonoran hot dog cart!  Friendly ladies show lots of pride in their business.  More diverse crowd than I was expecting.  Will return for sure.
