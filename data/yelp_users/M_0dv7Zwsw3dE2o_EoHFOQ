Incredible gourmet pizza, tons of rich flavor but ultimately light food. Lovely, interesting atmosphere and attentive, helpful staff. Try it before word gets out and it becomes tough to get in.

I have been a customer at numerous Schlotzsky's locations throughout the valley.  Prior to this experience I would have rated them overall as a 4.  At this particular location I experienced dirty conditions in the dining room and bathroom, an incorrect order, slow service and incompetent counter staff.  Fortunately the sandwich was still tasty and I discovered the order mistake before leaving.  I would skip this location.

My wife and I discovered this Yoga studio while searching for a yoga based charity to support.  The owner, Eric, also runs Operation Bootstrap a charity that provides a yoga and meditation based system to help veterans suffering from PTSD.   We took a class with Eric to get to know him and discuss Bootstrap.  Eric is one of the most welcoming and friendly people you will ever meet.  He starts the class off by going around the from and having everyone state their name and then asks any new students if they have any physical issues or injuries he should be aware of.  The class was a a more traditional physical yoga class, rather than our traditional Vinyasa style.  The class is a perfect mix that allows new students to learn and more experienced practitioners to perfect the poses and really get into the moment.  Eric provides great feedback throughout class and begins the class with just the right amount of mental conditioning as well.  We have been to this class many times and it never fails to challenge me mentally and physically.  We have since taken numerous workshops at the location on Yoga Nidra and Meditation.  We have also had many wonderful Vinyasa Flow classes with Jenn Brooks (check her out at Dancing Lotus Yoga for a full schedule).  The front desk staff and all the teachers we have met are always very friendly and competent.  Eric really sets the tone for the studio and it permeates the entire staff.  Although we have a regular yoga studio close to home this is the Best Yoga studio in North Phoenix!  Please check it out for regular classes or workshops.  You won't be disappointed.

I have somewhat of a hat addiction and unfortunately in the Phoenix Metro area the pickings are very slim for a hat store that offers a wide variety of hats outside of the  Cowboy variety. So when I discovered Heritage Hat Company I was pleasantly surprised.  The store is quite large with the entire front room dedicated to western style hats.  While this is not my thing it appeared as though you would have no problem finding a suitable one.  Now the back room is where I discovered what I was looking for.  Fedoras, Trilby's, Pork Pies, Flat Caps, Boaters, Derby's, Bowlers, Panamas and many more.  The color and style selection is actually overwhelming.  I suggest going in with some time on your hands to really look around and try on the different styles.  I ended up picking out a wool felt Stingy Fedora and a crush-able woven Stingy Fedora.  Rich, the owner, applied a free stain guard to both hats.  I also appreciated that Rich does not hover around while you are browsing, but offers just the right amount of assistance.  A truly wonderful experience!

Very typical Starbucks, but with some very comfy leather chairs. Clean environment with friendly staff.  On par with the better Starbucks locations.

One of my top sushi spots in the Phoenix area. Great service and reasonable prices. The baked scallop roll is a meal in itself and needs to be shared.  I have always had amazing service at all the valley locations.  I can't remember ever having a single issue with the food, service or ambiance!  One of my all time favorite places!

The most friendly and helpful cleaners I have ever visited! I wish I hadn't moved to the other side of town, so I could continue to use them.  You won't be disappointed!

Best coffee shop in this area! Friendly staff, good food (even the PBJ sandwich is outstanding) and nice atmosphere. Whether you're just looking to relax with a cup of joe or get some work done it's a great spot!

My wife and I have been into D'lish many times after one of my coworkers discovered it.  This was our Sunday breakfast spot for awhile and is my favorite spot to pick up a veggie burger in town.  Their food is both tasty and healthy and best of all it's not at all typical.  While I'm not a coffee drinker this place does offer all the usual fancy coffee drinks.  I have indulged in the smoothies and they are very tasty.    The service has always been very good, even when going through the drive-thru for pickup orders.    D'Lish is a super cool, hip little spot with the best veggie burger around!!!

I have been coming to D'Lish fairly regularly for about 3 years or so. I enjoy the fact it's not a huge chain and offers healthier food options. I've eaten just about everything vegetarian or fish on the menu as well as trIed the smoothies and tea options. Recently after having been frustrated many times over the past few months I finally had to give up on this place. The parking is situation is horrible or the ability to turn into the drive-thru line. The business basically needs someone conducting traffic duties to control the situation. It really is a huge traffic situation that oftentimes blocks the curb lane and either forces you to be a jerk who also blocks the lane or just give up. The staff typically ranges from barely polite to outright rude and they have no public restroom on the premises so I would recommend against eating in because even washing your hands after or before eating is completely out of the question. While the food is good it's not so amazing as to make up for these problems. Save yourself the aggravation and go to one of the many other options in the area

The food is always good, but always horribly slow for takeout and delivery. Usually about twice what is quoted, leaving you to sit and wait. After giving multiple chances we have decided not to do business here any longer.

Healthy, vegetarian friendly restaurant and market.  If you are looking for a healthy meal, funky gift or organic fare look no further than Luci's.  Great place for coffee or tea and a quick snack.

Since moving to Scottsdale this has become my repair shop of choice.  It has so far been below other repair shop quotes.  They have also been very helpful in always getting me in for an appointment quickly and have always been able to do repairs the same day, even when they are extremely busy.   The only downside is the gas prices are a little bit higher than the surrounding area.

One of the best yoga studios in the valley and in my opinion the best overall staff of teachers available in one location.  The facilities are nice and clean, unlimited towel service (hand and body) at no extra fee, large lockers and multiple showers with all the toiletries in them. There are numerous classes everyday running from 6/7am to 6/630pm depending on the day.   For a Slow Burn Class (slow vinyasa flow without heat) I'd recommend Alicia and Susan. In the heated Vinyasa flow classes I would recommend John S., Jenn C., Desiree L., Will G., Shaelyn M. and Julie B. The   The sequences, speed and temperatures in the flow classes vary slightly depending on the teacher but are mostly in what could be described as power yoga with music. John S. offers Pranayama after some of his classes which is really nice. Almost all the teachers run classes long, which is generous in that they are giving up more of their time to offer a better product.  They are also good about letting everyone know when it's close to normal ending time in case you have to leave on time.  Overall it's a great experience with very friendly teachers and good classes. The senior teachers at the facility really are fantastic and many teach workshops across the country.   Lifepower added Alpha Training (similar to Cross Training) about a year ago if you are into that.

If you are looking for some tasty and healthy food look no further. TFK offers excellent fare for the vegetarian or pescetarian alike.  My wife and I have been to TFK on many occasions including birthday parties for friends, group outings and entertaining out of town visitors.  The service and food quality is always very good.  We especially love the Ahi Tuna Sliders and highly recommend the Sweet Potato Hash and Kale Salad side.  We have tried every seafood dish on the menu and they have never failed to satisfy.  The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star experience is the price to portion size ratio.  The food is flavorful and healthy, but each entree will probably just fill you up and are not good for sharing unless you're not very hungry.  However for special occasions this place is high on my list!

Amazing spring rolls, great beer and wine selection and amazing staff. We have become regulars here and the service is always outstanding.  I love the spring rolls and if you are vegetarian or pescetarian this place has you covered.  The Pho is quite authentic but leans toward the healthy side without losing the great taste.  Seriously best vietnamese spring rolls anywhere. This is our favorite restaurant in Phoenix.

This will be a long one so here's the short version:  1. Making an appointment will not actually get you an appointment. 2. Watch out for the staff  skipping you with other customers. 3. Don't ever go here if you're in any hurry.    I've been in here with my wife several times for pedicures. On previous trips it was a decent experience, other than waiting past appointment times and realizing they don't really have a system for serving people in any given order. Not being in a hurry definitely help.   Today my wife called ahead for an appointment and got us two appointments for 230pm. We had an hour before we had to leave so this allowed just enough time to finish according to the staff.  Upon our arrival the place was full with just two open seats, but of course not enough employees to service that many customers.  We waited 25 minutes for my wife to be waited on, followed by me being skipped twice. When an employee finally came over and started the treatment it had been a 35 minute wait.  The employee began to trim my nails and in In the middle of one she stopped to clean another work station, this after we told the front desk person that we were in a hurry because they were behind and after being skipped. They half-heartedly apologized and I told them I had to just skip the whole thing as not to be late.  They still wanted to try and rush the process.   This seems like a place that stays busy, so they have no concern if they give out very bad service on occasion.

We eat at nice places quite frequently but this is the best service we've had in Phoenix. From the moment they opened the door for us when we walked everyone from the hostess to the server to the busser was pleasant and attentive. And the most important thing: the food definitely matches the service.  It is absolutely delicious!  The crab cakes are some of the best we've had, and meals are served with wonderful pretzel bread.

Best shop on Roosevelt row! If you are looking for some amazing art or a new addition to your home, look no further than the greenHaus! The wonderful proprietors are warm and helpful and their shop is filled with amazing finds.

Old school Barber Shop at its finest! Needed to find a new place to get my hair cut. After reading all the great reviews I decided to give this place a try. Went in about 3pm and was immediately greeted by Alex and shown to his chair. Alex did a phenomenal job even taking time to deal with my recheck my part after he was finished. While I have enjoyed going to a stylist the last few years, there is no substitute for a real barber when it comes to service. I love the attention to detail they take when using the clippers and straight razor on the edges. Alex is a pro and the hot towel and massage at the end is great. As I was leaving Boris, and when other customers did, made a point to ask if I was happy with my Haircut and service. That's a great business owner. I'll be back.

I have been here twice. The first time I got the Veggie Platter. A nice mix of hummus, pita, a little Greek salad and Dolmades. The food is nice, but nothing overly impressive.   On the first visit after ordering and waiting 5 minutes I was told they were out of hummus. What? A Greek place out of hummus?  At any rate I think they scraped the bottom of the barrel and I got some with my meal, but about half of what was pictured in the menu.   I went back again today, only because I was rushed for lunch and thought i'd give them another shot, since the food was ok last time.   I again ordered the veggie platter and was told it would be 20 minutes because they were slammed.  At the time they had three customers waiting that had already ordered. 20 minutes for a meal that has everything already made and just needs to be put in a to-go container. No thanks.   On top of this the staff is not really overly friendly. I'd skip this place.

I have been to Cuttlefish on two occasions and I must say the place has not disappointed! The staff from the owner on down has been amazing!  I've tried the Gnocchi, Mac & Cheese with Crab, Albacore, Shrimp and Grits, Branzino and the amazing bread (Squid-ink).  Everything was amazing and done just so.  The portions were generous and the staff gladly split even the most difficult items. I will definitely be back for round three soon.

We stopped off for a late breakfast after a night on the town. We had to wait a long time to be seated as many servers walked past and failed to acknowledge us. We were seated by a nice server and then waited about ten minutes until a less than cheerful server took our order. This was of course after several tables seated after us were served.  Then after another 25 minutes we were told that our order was delayed because of they were switching from breakfast to lunch. What?!?!?!  We left at that point having wasted a half an hour trying to get some eggs and toast. Worst service from start to finish I've had in maybe forever.  The food we did see appeared to be standard diner fair with a slight up charge. I would have to say don't waste the time or money. Wish they had a no star rating.

This was one of my two favorite gourmet veggie dogs when it was located in Sedona. They have now moved to my home city so I'm excited to be able to get it all the time. Simon's offers tasty dogs with very flavorful and interesting toppings. It's worth a try if you're in the area. It's an extra bonus that the owner is such a nice guy.

What can I say about Dapper Dan? Well I'm very picky and particular with my haircuts. I'm also very loyal once I find someone I like. I've only changed barbers/stylists a couple times and always after I or they moved.  All that said I can whole heartedly say that Dapper Dan is one of the best! He has an eye for detail that you should expect in a barber and while he is very quick with his skills you know he's never rushing. Throw in a quiet environment to relax in, a hot towel treatment and old school vibrating shoulder massage and you really can't go wrong. So make an appointment, drop in and enjoy a great cut and maybe a cold one!
