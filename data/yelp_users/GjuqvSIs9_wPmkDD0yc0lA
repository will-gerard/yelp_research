This place has gone downhill in cleanliness. Last week I was there with my kids and when we sat down, one of my kids noticed rice still stuck in her fork.  This happened a few months ago too and we pointed it out then.  I spoke to Bennie the manager about it and was assured they would look into it and fix the problem. Tonight we gave it another shot because if they were working on it, it would be fixed, right?  Nope. Silverware was crusted with food and Bennie didn't know what to say so he tried to suggest the caked on food was a water spot. Water spots are not 3 dimensional last I checked. Also, the ceramic plates had obvious chips which did not bode well.  We left without ordering. Health Department notified. That is all.

The store is fine but I would rather walk barefoot on shards of broken glass than have to use this pharmacy.  Was in there tonight with my obviously sick child (who by the way was seen at urgent care at PCH in lightening fast time).  Told 20 minutes and after the 20 was summoned to the counter only to get stuck behind a lady who was asking about possible refills on her husband's prescriptions which alone could have filled a drug store.  Only one gal at the front to help.  After 15 minutes of this the lady ran out of things to ask for and by now six people were in line.  Then I was told the prescription I had wasn't covered by insurance even though another Walgreens filled it for another family member a few weeks ago without issue.  When someone finally came from the back to help her they got it figured out.  My next mistake (after coming here) was admitting my kid had not taken this medication before because then they made me wait 15 minutes to speak to a pharmacist.  The pharmacist then came over and basically read the label to me. This experience took longer than my kid's entire visit to urgent care.  Avoid this pharmacy like the Plague because by the time you get your stuff, the Plague will have wiped us all out

Ever since the new folks took over this place has been wonderful.  The staff gets to know their customers well and my coworkers and I are greeted by name every time we go in. Their breakfast menu is great and you really can never go wrong with the hash browns.  I highly recommend this restaurant.

I'm not much of a sandwich person but this place is great. Yes, it's a little crowded at lunch time but with state, municipal, and federal jurors looking for lunch in downtown, you have to expect that. The hot pepper mix is amazing, the restaurant is clean and the employees are very nice and move the line very quickly. Try the chicken salad.

Just tried to go there to purchase a gift card. Closing hours not posted on door. Lady behind desk was on her phone and rudely yelled through locked doors that they were closed. Website and their own phone message day they are open until 6. It was 5:48.  I think someone wanted to go home early. They not only lost my sale but my business forever.

Came here for Sunday brunch with the family.  I think other reviewers have noticed a staffing problem--starting with the fact they are running this restaurant with minimal staff.  Came in and was told the wait would be 12 minutes.  12?  Weird. Looked around and there were tons of empty tables.   Was wondering why people were waiting when it looked like 1/3 of the restaurant was empty. My husband ordered the French toast brioche and because there has been some confusion in the past, we went so far as to make air circles to confirm with the waiter which French toast we wanted. (It's the round one.) After waiting way too long for our food, the waiter brought the other French toast because he "was confused."  If you're confused about what a customer wanted, would it dawn on you maybe to ask or clarify?  My husband then had to wait to get his meal. Manager did the right thing and comped it, but we'd rather pay for correct food than go through the annoyance. They do have a new chicken and waffle dish which was good, but I won't be eating it much due to the substandard service here.

Can't ask for a nicer place with nicer people. Dr Hildebrand is wonderful.  My elderly lab made it to 14 and he pulled her out of the woods more than once. He now sees my puppy and it's just so wonderful having him as a vet.  Staff is very responsive and caring. Would give 6 stars if I could.

Food is good but customer service sucks when they're not busy. Was behind a large salad order and 7 other employees stood around watching the guy making salads and seriously not one helped him. Waited 10 minutes with no other customers around to get helped.  Several employees looked at me but not one acknowledged me.  Watched them stack bowls, talk about their weekend plans, and stare at the cookie machine like they were waiting for it to do something unique.  I just saw some other reviews below about the poor customer service and I'm guessing no one from management who cares is reading the reviews because the same complaints are being posted over and over and no one appears to care.

Manager was a real @$$hat  walked up to automatic door at same time as another lady.  It was 6:59 and I just needed a few pieces of paper for my kids's project.  The auto door opened but before we could walk in, the manager slams the doors in our faces and and informs us, "It's 7:00.  We're closed!"  There were still customers in the store.  Would it have killed him to let us in?  The other customer and I were both taken aback so I know it wasn't just me.  Drove three miles to the nearby Office Max.  I used to spend a lot of money in Staples.  Those days are over.

The food is good but the customer service is not great. We have not been here in months because they take so long in the mornings that we would be late to work if we stop. This morning my husband went in to get a bagel and he was the only person in the store.  He got his bagel and was ushered to the register to pay. He stood at the register for a full 3 minutes alone waiting to pay while several employees were in the back laughing, talking and enjoying a beverage. He timed it--literally 3 minutes and if you don't think that's long, please stand doing nothing for 3 minutes and you will get a sense of how annoying it is. He finally gave up and walked out after one employee said she'd be with him "in a minute" as she was downing a beverage.  Probably won't go back for a long time.

Buying furniture should not be an aggravating experience. Unfortunately, my recent purchases from this company have given my husband and me nothing but grief.  We bought furniture twice from Ashley. The first was in September, and after this experience, we should have had our heads examined for going back. We decided to purchase bedroom furniture for our kids.  We visited the Avondale, Arizona store and worked with a salesman we really liked.  We were able to negotiate a fair price for two bedroom sets.  We signed the contract and arranged delivery for mid-October.  When the sets arrived, the bookcase and a drawer on one set was damaged. Ashley arranged to get replacements. The bigger issue was with my other daughter's set. When it was set up, my husband and the delivery person noticed that a piece was missing from the headboard.  My husband wanted to refuse the headboard, but the delivery guy assured him the piece was not critical and that the piece would be sent right to us and would just pop right in.  Based on this, we accepted the headboard. Big mistake. The driver said that the missing piece was a simple screw and that customer service could replace it without a problem.  He insisted he did not know what happened to it since he had all the screws when he started.  The driver then tried to leave without telling us he was finished. In retrospect it was like he was trying to avoid any kind of issue with the missing piece.  We contacted customer service to see how long it would be before getting the missing piece in the mail, only to be told they would have to send a tech out to look at it before they would mail parts.  At first, Ashley claimed that a screw did not go in that location.  They then claimed that they could not order just that part.  They continuously refused to send out a new headboard.  We called again and they finally agreed to send the missing piece.  We received the part about 5 days later and it was not the complete part.  Customer Service sent the screw but not the "nut" that the screw went into to secure it.  We called customer service again and got the same response, which was that they would have to send out a tech.  We finally got to talk to a supervisor, who after lengthy argument, agreed to send a new headboard. It took probably 8 hours of phone calls with the "customer disservice center" on our part to get this resolved.  It culminated in Ashley bringing us a new headboard, which should have been done in the first place.  Despite all this, we decided to give Ashley one more try to see if we could just go in, buy furniture, have it delivered, and enjoy it.  After all, the headboard issue had to be an anomaly, right?  Wrong.  We wanted to replace our living room furniture and saw some nice sofas in the showroom that had grown on us after seeing them a few times. In November, we went back to the store and we met another sales person who was very nice. The black Friday sale was starting and The associate was able to work up a good price for the purchase and delivery of two sofas and a loveseat.  I bought them the night before Thanksgiving and made arrangements to have them delivered over a month later, on December 29th, because we would be home and available.  The furniture was in stock. My brother was going to take our old living room furniture away and rented a big U-haul for the 28th so our living room would be empty and ready for delivery. On December 27th, we got a message from Ashley that was barely audible, but we did get the sense that something was wrong.  We called for translation of the garbled message and were told that the furniture we bought was now NOT in stock and we could have it January 8th.  We were furious.  We work, and getting time to be home for delivery is not easy.  We had intentionally arranged for the furniture to be delivered when we were home on vacation and, because it was in stock, we were assured that it would be delivered the day we wanted it.  Not only was could we not have the furniture when it was promised in the contract, but my brother had to cancel the Uhaul and incurred a fee.  Ashley played Russian Roulette that they would have our items in stock when we needed them and sold them out from under us. Frustrated with the whole situation, we went to the store the next day to cancel our order. Manager Rick tried to save the sale by offering a ridiculous solution that would have required me (in our Civic) to pick up the sofas myself and he would deliver my love seat and he'd take off $200.  Wait.  I have to rent a truck, drive 40 miles to the warehouse and deliver my own large sofas? What part of this was a benefit to us?  No thanks.  Shopping at Room Store.

I called to see if there was anything our salesperson could do to help. She remembered me and even recalled the three big pieces of furniture that I purchased. She wanted to help, and was very good at calling me back, but the situation was out of her hands.  No one else from Ashley ever called us back.  Frustrated with the whole situation, we went to the store the next day to cancel our order. I had the ladies at the counter call over the manager to explain why I was doing it so I would not have to repeat myself.  Rick came over, acknowledged that he remembered me from being in the store, and I expressed to him why I was so upset.  To save the sale Rick made me an offer that, quite frankly, was insulting.  He offered to take $200 off, have me pick up the sofas myself from the warehouse, and he would bring the loveseat.   Let me break that down. That would be a refund of my $100 delivery.  Then, with the other $100 I would have to rent a vehicle since the sofas will not fit in my Honda Accord.  I would have to pay for the gas to drive over 30 miles from my home to the warehouse and back and handle two pieces of furniture that weigh more than I do.  If I missed the part of this that benefitted me in any way, shape or form, please let me know, because I'm just not seeing it.  Rick was gushing on and on that he was trying to help but i had a hard time with his concept of help. He offered no alternative to this ridiculous suggestion. Additionally, he refused to look at, talk to, or in any way address my husband who was standing there with me.  When my husband asked him a question, Rick would not even look at him.   Worst experience ever.  Was much happier at Room Store.

The room was immaculate and Breana was friendly and did a great job. I really like the wax too which was designed just for this studio. Would definitely go here again. I also appreciated how quick they were too.

Been in line for 10 minutes. 12 people in front of me and they have not taken a single order since we got here. They are painfully understaffed. Two people working and a third guy-- not the heck sure what he is doing. A bunch of very annoyed people who ordered are awaiting their drinks as well. I'd leave but at this point am too vested.

Called the Heath department after our visit. We watched the cashier handle money and wipe his nose and then touch our food without washing hand/using gloves. As it was they were slow and overpriced. Can't speak to how the food tasted because we left without eating after the sanitation issue.

The food is really good and the staff is friendly, but there is too much socializing going on. We were the only people here when we ordered our food and when we sat down, a co-worker who was obviously buddies with the guy who took our order, walked in. At this point everyone working went to the employee area to chitchat with him and no one was making any of the food we ordered. Took around five minutes before anyone made any effort to prepare food. All the employees were really young and it did not appear there was any managerial type person around.  Other than this we really like eating here.

Ate here for the first time today. They've been open about four weeks. Overall we liked it.  I had the lobster tacos which were served with a mango  fruit and they were very good. My daughter's steak empanadas were excellent.   Husband had the carne asada tacos. The meat was good but the taco itself was a little dry--needed some green salsa or something. The rice and beans came with some kind of sour cream drizzle on them which was not mentioned on the menu but the staff was nice enough to replace them with plain ones.  The papas were hot, both in temperature and taste.  Husband thought they had too much chili powder.  Reuben, the manager, is a really nice guy and was very receptive to our feedback which included a suggestion to be able to mix and match tacos.  They promote themselves as a taco shop but did not have very many kinds of tacos.  Overall it was a very good lunch and we will definitely go back.

We have enjoyed Hot and Juicy at Westgate so when Angry Crab opened up, we were anxious to try it. Definitely a good choice. We were seated timely and the restaurant was very clean. Server greeted us quickly and was well versed about the menu, level of heat, etc. . The food came out hot and we really enjoyed our meal.  King crab legs were great at a medium spice level. The cayenne pepper was very noticeable at first but by the second or third bite you could really appreciate the crab. Tried the shrimp at a mild with the garlic and was pleased with that as well.  The hush puppies were a good appetizer and there were plenty of them in the order. I noticed someone gave them one star for no utensils and food coming in a bag. If you come here you need to understand the concept of how this food is served. You can't go to McDonald's and complain about the lack of steak so don't come here expecting an Ocean Club experience. If you like the Cajun style seafood and don't mind eating with your hands, this is a great place to go.
