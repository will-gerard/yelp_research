accompanied my friend here.  The doctor (Dr. White) was friendly on first visit but hostile on the the second.  He didn't listen when she explained that she'd had an adverse reaction to the medication that he'd prescribed and told her she was welcome to look elsewhere if she didn't like the process he was using to find out what was causing her pain.  Also be aware, this clinic requires extreme evidence before prescribing any narcotics which is offensive to me since it makes the normal. average person feel like their being accused of being a drug user just because OTC meds like Tylenol and Advil are not helping with their pain.    Don't go here.

Priced about a buck too expensive is my only negative. Their food was prompt, hot and delicious. Ordered the Monterey Chicken and it was spicy but devine. The BBQ Bacon burger was perfect and the Cheesy burger was a hearty, happy burger though the least of the bunch.  Their sweet potato fries were thin and the perfect amount of crisp.   Try all the in-house sauces. They rock. I really liked both toasted mashmallow and apple cider on the sweet potato fries.

The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. They took their time to help all 4 people I brought in find what they wanted. I highly recommend them.
