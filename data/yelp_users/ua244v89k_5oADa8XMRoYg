So, I called this location asking about bowling for a Thursday night a 9pm. The lady who answered didn't say anything other than its $7 a person, so we decided to head out to this location. 20 minutes away.   Parking is pretty big, but it was full. There was the first alarm, why was it packed so late? Well when we arrive we are told there's a tournament. That would've been wonderful information to have. Now we are waiting for 20 minutes to "possibly" get a lane. The management needs to start training better here. Not sure if they're aware, but college students talk. Word can spread pretty fast if a place has horrid customer service.   So to recap... Tell customers who aren't "league" players that there's a possibility it will be full. Fix your games because the dancing one is broken. Work on training staff to be a little more friendly.

After moving into the area, I have been curious about what places near me have decent food. Now I do love me some sammiches. I usually get nervous about chain places, but this way a different story.  Decor: some chairs and tables for getting a quick bite. Music plays in the back ground. When you go to order, small menu with customization available.  Food: so I got the #14 with pastrami. The meat was sliced fresh, so was the cheese. The bread is baked fresh daily according to them. It tasted amazing, and fresh. I was pretty impressed with the quality I received and paid for.  Customer service: not much to say here, it was ok?  Overall: I do love subs and I will be going back there again. Hopefully it's going to be just as good tasting.

There seems to be a lot of bad reviews on here, and I'm not sure why honestly...  Service-- so I ordered carry out because I'm not lazy. I followed the timer and got there a minute after it went off. Pizza was waiting for me hot and fresh. The staff was friendly and quick, can't argue over that.  Food-- it was stuffed crust pizza, do I need to explain more?!? It was pretty good, little on the greasy side, but I don't mind it one bit.  Overall--- not sure why so many people are hating on Pizza Hut lately. I loved it and will go back.

So, because I have moved from California, I have become a little spoiled when it comes to Mexican food. Sadly, this place truly missed the mark when it came to their burritos. So...  Decor: So the place itself it pretty small on the inside, couple tables to sit at, and maybe 2 tv's.  Besides that, the decor is bland and not interesting. The menu is expansive and takes up almost the whole cash rack area.   Customer Service: The cashier was really nice and answered our questions. Other than that we really didn't have any other issues in this department.  Food: This is where the review goes downhill, in a quick hurry. Sadly, we both ordered burritos. I had the new "grilled" chicken chipotle burrito. The chicken was not grilled, at all. I work in the food industry, and that chicken is frozen. I can promise you that "chicken" has never seen the light of day on a grill. It was rubbery, bland, and disgusting. The sauce in that burrito was disgustingly sweet. Why do I want a sweet sauce in my burrito? Obviously people here have never tried a true, Mexican style burrito because that was a honest shame of an attempt. You can tell the people who work there don't care a bit about the food they push out. The only plus? the "fresh" salsa bar. Besides that, everything was garbage.  Overall: I took 3 bites out my burrito, and threw it out. My finacee ate a couple bites of hers, and tossed it as well. It was covered in some fake guacamole, and enough tomatoes to grow a personal garden. I will never, ever go there again, and I will be calling management about the terrible experience. My advise? find somewhere else to go, a taco truck has better food than this place.

As I write this review, please keep in mind I'm by no means a Thai food expert...  This nice little Thai place is on the corner of Mckellips and Recker Rd. At first glance, it may not seem much, but the gem is truly inside....  Decor: I personally love little restaurants that have simple decor. This place has nice booths, couple of tables. They have a little fountain with fake flowers in it. I personally loved it.  Food: we ordered the original pad Thai with chicken, orange chicken special, and egg rolls. The food was delicious, and I was beyond surprised on how good it was. The sauce did seem a little bland, but overall really good.   Customer Service: Not too much to write about here, she was welcoming at first. Had trouble with English, and trying to work their POS system. Drinks were filled, they were polite. I was satisfied.  Overall: I am glad I didn't read and believe some of the reviews here. I throughly enjoyed my dinner at this restaurant and will continue to recommend, and return here another time.

Everybody has the right idea about reviews of this place. I didn't have a single complaint!  Decor: we walked into a really clean restaurant. Docor was comfortable as most other places, and they had plenty of seating indoor and out.  Customer service: Right as we walked in, we were greeted warmly, and the cashier was super friendly, attentive, and made it relaxing. Tried upselling shakes, but not in a rude way at all. Very nice staff, hands down.  Food: I had the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger. The burger was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and dressed. I have zero complaints about the food. Fast, fresh, and yummy fries.  Overall: I will be coming back here for sure, still haven't found a burger spot to rival!
