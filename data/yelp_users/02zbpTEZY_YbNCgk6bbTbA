If I had to eat at the same restaurant every day, I would choose Pita Jungle.  I could have their babaghannoush and lavosh chicken shwarma day in and day out! Seriously I am never let down by their food and quality of the food as well.  After living overseas in the Middle East, I had looked everywhere to find that authentic flavor of hummus & baba; and I found it (to my surprise) at Pita Jungle! I will always come back here, and it just always "sounds good."

I was introduced to this place by a close friend of mine years ago. Ever since, I have always found Coffee Rush to be a place that I can go to without all of that "too-fast-paced-hurry-up-and-order-your-drink" pressure.   Anytime I have a friend visiting from out of town, I take them here! They have an amazing outdoor patio, and a relatable ambiance.   I may have about three stamp cards floating around in my wallet at any given time, and they are always willing to combine them for me too. The baristas are always friendly and truly interested in their customers that walk through their doors. Can't get much better than that!

This was walking distance from my old house, and my boyfriend and I frequented our weekend mornings for breakfast quite often.  The employees at Acacia always make you feel like you're at "home" and treat you like family. We even ended up finding ourselves here on Mother's Day, and the lady that (might be the owner), and definitely a Mother was busy taking care of all her guests at the restaurant for breakfast and truly seemed to enjoy making people happy.  My go-to was always the breakfast sandwich on sourdough, bacon, eggs & cheese with a side of hashbrowns. They had this really yummy cinnamon vanilla coffee blend too that I'd always order.  You won't regret stopping by here for breakfast! When it's nice outside, the patio in the morning was always peaceful and a nice way to get your day going.

Anytime my girlfriends and I want to catch up during the week, there is something so relaxing about getting a pedicure at pink polish! I love that they take reservations and keep them, which is very helpful if you have more than two people joining you.  My best friend visited me from out of town, and she really wanted to get a gel manicure, and naturally I took her here. We loved our nails and the designs that they were able to do free hand.

If I was ever remotely near Chandler, this was the best gas station to go to.  There are plenty of spaces (sometimes gets a little crowded), but it seems to move quickly. Not to mention the gas prices are always the best, and the service is spot on.   I love that QT has cubed ice (game changer) and that the employees are always ringing up 2-4 people at a time! It makes the line go quickly, and you're in and out as fast as you need to be.

The first step to an amazing burrito is the tortilla. This places nails that. Second, you can't go wrong with the carne asada filling or breakfast burritos (all day) if you're up for it. This is the best place for a burrito.

I ended up here on a early Sunday morning after hiking, and I was so glad that they were open. I ordered a Sunrise Wrap and it was the perfect serving amount. Not to mention it was so gorgeous and peaceful outside in downtown Chandler that early. I really love that there are always different tea flavors and they have Truvia packets if you want to sweeten it up just a little bit.

I really wanted to like this place. It took me a while to try it, but I found myself here a few weeks ago, and was really not impressed, rather found myself really disappointed.   My friend and I were here during Happy Hour, and ordered chicken taquitos to share. I ordered pulled-pork tacos as an entree, and she got an enchilada that was smothered (overly) in sauce. The pork that I had was dry, and the rice was dry too. The refried beans were okay, but it wasn't worth the price we paid.   The saving grace here was our waitress. She was super nice and helpful, but neither of us enjoyed the food. It was very mushy, not tasty, and honestly I'm not sure why they are rated as high as they claim to be. There is much better Mexican food to find in the valley, this place just isn't one of them.
