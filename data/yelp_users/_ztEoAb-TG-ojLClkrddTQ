Always a pleasant experience. The staff could not be friendlier, always a smile and a laugh. Dr. Wyman is superb, takes the time to ask how things are going, and yet still manages to maintain a schedule. She's always willing to explain the readings and let you know what's happening with your eyesight. I definitely would not hesitate to recommend Pearson Eyecare Group.

Back at Pearson Eyecare Group yesterday, and yet again, wonderful service. Some of the staff have changed, but the level of attention and service that you receive remains the same. I'd been having a couple of issues with my contact lenses, Dr. Wyman took the time to listen, review and explain the scans etc. then weigh up the options. She always finds the time, no matter how busy they are. I would not go anywhere else.

Very poor. Ordered 1 pizza at 18:20, email received indicating that the pizza would be delivered in 30 - 40 minutes.  At 45 minutes, telephoned the store and was told sorry, internet timing was incorrect, actual wait time would be 45 - 60 mins.  Told it's the next pizza to be delivered, should be 5 - 10 mins.  At least 15 - 20 mins. later, pizza finally arrived.  No apology, nothing.  So, from being 30 - 40 mins., pizza actually arrived in 60 - 70 mins.  Apparently you're required to award 1 star... which in this case is 1 star too many.
