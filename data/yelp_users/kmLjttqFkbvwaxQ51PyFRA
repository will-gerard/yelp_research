I am preparing to travel with small dog and need pricing for health certificate.  I called a few places....when I called here I was told "no pricing over the phone".  What?  Are you kidding?  Not even for the document? How about price for office visit?  NO...she told me no pricing given for ANYTHING over the phone.  I suspect it is on the same lines as a restaurant with no pricing on the menu...I can't afford it.  This was the ONLY place that could not give me a price for a simple office visit or health certificate.

Bobby Q never disappoints.  They serve the best chocolate martinis and I have  one or two every visit.  I usually order steak or BBQ combo. Tonight I tried the fried chicken with mashed potatoes/gravy.  Another winner.

I have been going here since it opened!  I used to work in the building nearby and would walk over for an afternoon cookie.  Even though I don't work nearby...I make it a point to stop in now and then.  LOVE this place!!!!

Heading into hone depot and hungry.  I was lured into the taco bell drive thru after seeing signs on their window advertising the new chicken biscuit taco.  Sounded good. I try to order and chick in drive thru has no idea...she then tells me there is no such item. I leave drive thru thinking I must have been seeing things....but NO I wasnt....I see the sign again and this time I called.   Girl answers and says it's only served for breakfast.  Signs do NOT say that.  What a waste of my time.

My family and I come here quite a bit.  Love the beef tacos...love the tortilla.  Until today I've never had a problem.   Met here for lunch today.  Cashier was great. I was ordering flautas...I wanted beef and chicken.  He recommended the combo and confirmed I would be able to have mixed...2 chicken and 1 beef.    It takes awhile for the food....not too long.  Well. Mine had only chicken.  No beef.  I let the girl at the counter know.  This is where it gets ridiculous.  She offered to take my entire meal and remake it.  No...I didn't want to wait for an entire new meal. My sister had her food and we were ready to sit down and eat.   I asked if she could just make me one  beef.   She said I would have to pay for it. (I considered it...but it would be too much food for me) I said.  Just take one of the chicken and give me one beef. No.  She would not do that.  I asked was she going to throw mine away. She said...yes. She would toss my meal and make an entire new one.  So. I had 2 choices.  Buy a beef flautas OR wait for a brand new meal.   I opted to just eat what I had.  The food was great.  But....the customer service was absolutely horrible.   Why not just frigging make me ONE darn beef flauta.  You can toss ONE of my chicken...but why toss my entire meal and make me have to wait.  How hard is THAT????   YOU MESSED UP MY ORDER.....be a little accommodating.   Hopefully someone from Carolinas actually reads these yelp reviews.  If you do. Talk to the chick that was there today about 130 or 2 pm  OH.. it was not busy and most of your tables were dirty.

I go here often because it is close by.  It is by far NOT my favorite location.  The staff is friendly and all that.  BUT what is the deal with paper....I am NEVER given a napkin when I order food.  It is now. a game for me....I order.  If I do not get a napkin I absolutely do not tip.  I think tipping a drive thru for a basic item is ridiculous anyway....but when you cannot give me a napkin, FORGET IT.  Another paper issue...receipts wth don't you offer a receipt for every order?????  I pay cash. For a period of time I was in a situation where I could submit my receipts for reimbursement, I hate having to remember to ask for a receipt..  I lost quite a bit of money because of this.  I called their corporate...and know that there was no order from above to withhold receipts and napkins.  Its the little things that can be so annoying or make someone's day.  Smile and give someone ordering a food item a friggen napkin.  Is that tooo much to ask?  FYI...this napkin withholding occurs morning/noon/night.

Stopped in for a midday snack.  The s'mores cupcake was heavenly.  Prices are as expected.  Staff is nice.  Location is easy to find...parking isn't so great.  Next visit I'm trying out the cupcake dispenser!

I was very excited to order from here.  I am giving a low rating because of the service used to deliver my food.  AzMealMan.  I ordered my meal and it was delivered; after the girl left I noticed that I was missing a dish and there were no eating utensils or napkins.  I immediately called Azmealman...already closed.  I left a voicemail and I even wrote on the facebook page.  They responded on the fb page by telling me to call...which I already had!!!  I called again tonight.  Nothing yet.  OH...and now they don't allow comments on their fb page.  So.  Two things....missing dish, no eating utensils, no follow up, no facebook posts/comments from public...thumbs down.  AS for the food I did get...it was ok.  RIce with peans/nuts was generous and tasted good,, tandoori mixed plate was good...and there was alot of it.  The naan was not worth $1.50 at all.  In fact...it wasn't worth the $41 at all.  I might try it again by actually GOING to the buffet...perhaps I can recoup some of my losses then.

I've been coming here for years now.  I have tried other places but they are by far the best of their type.  I love that they do both the manicure and pedicure at same time.  Happy feet is the best and worth the extra money.   The only problem I've ever had had been with simple miscommunication and is always corrected.

My sister and I came today for early mothers day lunch. My sister and niece got their food.  I waited forever;  I finally got ahold of staff who informed me that my food must have been taken by someone else.  It was too late to wait for another sandwich and was refunded my money in a too bad...so sad attitude.  Don't they check those receipts?  Thanks for nothing.  Aside from no lunch...the iced tea and potato salad was good and it was a beautiful day.   I FORGOT...ordering. the stellar customer service started inside.  Ok.  I was looking at dessert counter near first register. I wanted the creme brulee but couldn't reach it...I asked for one but guy at first register was busy taking an order...since I was being called to next register I hurried over. Told her I wanted the brulee...she told me to get it myself.   I told her I can't reach it. It was CLOSER to her!!! She did not pull it! I cancelled it. Lol.  Can you believe that!!!

Not everyday is perfect.  I drive a little ways to get here and not usually dressed to go inside.  This morning I had Lamar craving. Drove over and was greeted in drivethrough. Asked to wait.  It's hot so I drove to window where is shady.  I was the only vehicle; i waited a pretty darn long time... honked my horn and tapped on window.  I was just getting ready to call them on my cell. .. and was in process of writing angry review when they came to window and profusely apologized. ... it was truly an oversight and they are busy inside.   I got my order. Everything was good. Things happen sometimes. .. but it's how a business handles them that matters.   Like always the staff was wonderful and i will be back.

I had the most wonderful meal tonight....highly recommend you try this place.  The staff was warm and friendly.  The prices are reasonable/fair.  I had the pate chaud, Golden vermicilli, cheese cake and a hot mumbai spirit.  I WILL be back for more!

Confusing menu and just too expensive.   Single burger. Onion rings. Chocolate malt came to over $10.   And supposedly malts were on sale. I left. Went across the street to in/out burger where i paid $6.  Culver's is tasty...but not for price.

Ask for Sharon.   She is the one....great service. Excellent personality.  getting a Brazilian is a very personal service.....she is able to keep your attention away from the fact that you are..... you know ladies! ....she puts you at ease.  Plus she is fast!  Eyebrow full Brazilian armpits and nose....done so fast. Impressive.  Ask for her!.

OMG...I cannot believe the whiners.  Sorry folks...but this place is part of the ghetto-fabulous food experience that made Phoenix RITO'S the best....and now they are sharing with Glendale.  The original Ritos is in an old hot house in the hood...like, in the freakin downtown ghetto...where white folks don't go at night without an escort.  They had horrible hours, long lines, limited menu...we LOVE them.  You want their good food..then plan your trip there accordingly...who cares about ambience.  If you want to look at pretty pics on the wall...go somewhere else and leave this place to people like me who appreciate good real home made mexican food.  THANK YOU RITOS FOR COMING TO GLENDALE

I love trying out new spots. Found this place on yelp and stopped in for the first time a few weeks ago.  I ordered fresh oj eggs bacon potatoes and choose pancake as my side.  It was alot.of food and asked to have half packed to go.   There were a few glitches. ...but the waiter was fabulous.  He excused himself and shortly the manager came to see me.  The situation was immediately rectified....mind you I was never upset. I simply pointed it out to the waiter.  I was so impressed with the prompt action and value placed on their quality of service and food.  To that end....the food was incredible.   I will be back.

Had the chicken artichoke salad and it was delicious, even though I kept wondering to myself...what the "chicken" concoction really was.  I did wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food...the cashier said to just go ahead, find a seat anywhere and they will find me.  They apparently looked everywhere except that little patio a few steps from the cashier.  :-(    Since it was a salad and not a hot entree...no harm done!  I will be going back.  Since my first visit I have been back several times...service has been perfect and I really like this place ALOT.

I discovered this place a few weeks ago and have ordered from here now a few times while my kitchen is out of order during a remodel.  Their food is excellent and the delivery SUPER FAST.    pumpkin curry was good, chicken satay, panang curry..rice, won ton...yep, good food.  :-)  Only one issue and that is there were no eating utensils or napkins provided.  The first time I didn't say anything; 2nd time I placed order using online service and specifically asked for these items.  Arrived without them.  I told the delivery lady and she was SO nice....I told  her that I didn't have a kitchen and need those items, but that I could borrow some from neighbor this time.  She was so incredible...I told it was okay, she left and then before I even got settled was back and brought me utensils, plates, bowls!! I was so impressed.  She went over/beyond and I appreciated it.

Well....up until tonight I was very happy with this restaurant.  TONIGHT just before closing i ordered home delivery online.  40 minutes later I still do not have my food.   I look up my order status and it shows that my order is due to arrive TOMORROW MORNING.  I contacted 24/7 and the chat person and asked why there was not a warning or notice before i ordered....they insisted that the restaurant closed at 830p and that I had ordered at 955p.  I had to copy the restaurants hours showing they were open until 9 and prove to this chat person that it was only after 9 p.m. at the time I was chatting...this "kim" chat person ARGUED WITH ME and told me that I needed to check my clocks!!!!   Can you believe that.  At any rate...I sent the copied conversation to 24/7 email and the restaurant.  So...over an hour wasted ordering and waiting for a meal that is not coming and dealing with some chat crud.  I am hungry and cranky.  Another warning...if you use that online delivery service 24/7 and pay with card/paypal...it can take 5 days to get your money back.

I was pretty excited to try this place out.  I saw on yelp that they had beignets and well...I drove right over!  Haven't had a fresh beignet since I was in New Orleans few years ago.  They were absolutely delish...really, enough for 2/3 people...but I still ate all three.  Very nice, laid back place and I will be returning.

Need a vacation? How about a spa-cation?  New Serenity massage/facial will take you to a place of sheer bliss.    The spa is nestled in an easy to find location off the 101 on Hayden....great selection of restaurants and shopping nearby.    I walked in and was greeted with a friendly warm welcome; the well decorated waiting area sets the mood with a serene water fountain and fruit infused drinking water for guests.  I could feel myself relaxing already!  I was quickly escorted to my first destination...a 60 minute serenity massage with Tamara.  When I walked into the room my eyes were immediately drawn to wall art. Stunning illuminated local landscape shed just the right amount of light into the room.  .The beds are warmed!  Tamara came in and was attentive to every aspect of my needs and comfort. Then she touched my back....I immediately felt the energy. Her hands are magic...the pressure was perfect and she hit every single area that needed extra attention.  The movement was fluid and flowing....it wasn't long before I found myself drifting away to the land of bliss.  The warm towel under my neck and foot scrub are a perfect touch.  When our session was over I found myself amazed that it had only been an hour; usually I feel like I need more...but Tamara had provided such a relaxing thorough service that I actually felt as if I had been there for 2 hours.  I felt that good!     Tamara gave me a comfortable robe and I was soon onto my next stop....a facial with Shayna.    Shayna led me into her facial room.  Another well decorated, relaxing space, with yes....that beautiful wallart!   The hour with Shayna was incredible...she is personable, knowledgeable, attentive and has a great touch.  The facial treatment includes more massage...OMG.  I was in heaven.  I had not only a fabulous facial, but a relaxing facial/head/upper body massage.  The hour with Shayna was so enjoyable.  Towards the end I started to prepare myself mentally for a product sales pitch.  NONE.  We discussed product, but there was no awkward moment at the end of our service of her trying to talk me into buying anything!  I was so impressed.. For that reason alone; I would be more apt to purchase what I need from them.  My skin felt amazing...thank you!!!  The check out receptionist was warm and friendly.  My spa-cation ended and as I left the parking lot I reflected on the great experience and my heart was filled with gratitude. It was a wonderful experience.  i encourage you to visit New Serenity Spa and experience the great energy and effective therapies.  Next I want to try their yoga studio....

I was craving fried rice and soup. I remembered seeing this place and decided to stop in.  I ordered the Walnut shrimp and war wonton soup.  Of course I had enough for three meals and did take most of it home.  Delicious.   I can't wait to eat there again.
