I bought this pizza for my workers as a thank you for completing a special project that took 2-weeks, so we were all hungry! I was told by one of my guys that I must had ordered a speciality pizza, because it was not great, not bad, but not great. Next time I'll stick to the popular choices and have a better experience.

I'm a business owner and have been doing business here for about 2-years. We rented a 26' box truck and because I was super busy with work, I sent my 80 yr old mother to rent the truck this time. We used the truck for 5-hours and brought it back. The guy at the desk says the top of the truck was damaged and we are responsible. I know for a fact that we did not damage this truck, if we had, we would certainly man up and admit this. Its my fault for not inspecting the truck myself, but these guys really took advantage of an old lady, and now I am faced with paying $2000.00 for a truck that I did not damage! I calmly argued my point to the rental guy, only to be met with a rude, callused and insulting response. Cheap rates but you'd be better off renting from Enterprise or Ryder.

This place rocks! I brought my car here because of a cracked radiator along with several other issues. They were able to match the price of an online mechanic service , and get the repair done the very same day. The owner stayed late just for me so that I could come pick up my vehicle which was nice , the car came back 100% problems fixed. Competitive price , great same day service, and very knowledgeable, honest and friendly staff of mechanic and techs.

These are 2 really stand up guys! My friends car broke down near there shop,  they replaced the starter and did it at a very fair price, AND within 2-hours...AND on a Saturday!  Even helped me push the car into the shop (no starter). It's not the best neighborhood but Tony's Auto had earned my loyalty.  @LeviFerrin

We've been coming here for 2-years, and the food is always good. Its mostly a lunch place for nearby businesses I think. They just introduced 4 new BBQ sandwiches, and me and a co-worker both tried different ones. I had a Indiana style pork sandwich, which was great! Reminded me of home..  The price is just $3 or $4 more than fast food, but oh so much better!

Tried it for the first time today, not impressed. Overpriced for a 1/2 sub, $10.20. The roast beef sub was dry, I've had better...stick with Firehouse, its better.

Best cut in a long time.  Get the full service shave n cut, hot towels & very relaxing.  Definitely go back. A real barber shop..

Well I won $780.00, BUT....the rudeness of the floor manager over shadowed any joy I might have felt. I've been here before and usually the same experience. Waited for 20 min for a coke, slow valet and very rude staff.

Very clean with 3 friendly staff (on a Sunday no less) working.  I usually drop off my laundry and let them do it, but today I washed my cloths. Nice place.

Used the coupon with no problem, the price is in line with what others charged in the past, it took about 20 min. to complete (seems 5 customers showed up at the same time). Nice staff and would go back again.

Our Commercial office/warehouse was having a lot of issues with the A/C, and we thought we would need to replace the unit, but really didn't want to as we are in a lease for only 1 more year. My service guy was Bud, and he REALLY knew what he was doing! Very professional, got the job done in less than an hour, and charged a very fair price. I even sent him to fix my own Mothers A/C, that's how much trust I have in him. Very good experience!

I've been looking for a barber for the past year! And I found it! Great attention to detail, very friendly staff, clean, and the barbers use straight razors like it's there 2nd hand! I really like this place.   Oh and the stories they tell are funny!

Great food and the same attentive service we come to expect. We eat here at least once a week now that they're in Tempe.

I've been wanting to try this location for some time and it did not disappoint!  Very fresh & good. We have Mogolian beef & peanut chicken in a mild spicy sauce. Good...
