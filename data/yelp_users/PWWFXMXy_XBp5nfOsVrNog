So I signed up with this gym about 4 months ago, my sales person's name was Kyle.  Wow he was great!  Right from the moment I had to fill out the forms he was polite and professioanl.  He answered all my questions and didn't try to "sell" me on the gym.  Let's be honest, there are lots of gyms to choose from, LA Fit, Lifetime, etc etc and they all offer pretty similar perks.  Gold's certainly stands out and Kyle and his manager, I think his name is Blaine, pointed out what stands them apart from the competition.  A movie theatre I do my cardio in, amazing instructors in the classes, especially spin, towel service, a free body fat assesment from the trainers.  I was just really surprised at all the extra.   Needless to say I go about 5 times a week and I have yet to have any issues after 4 months.  I think they ran out of towels once and Kyle said as soon as fresh ones came out of the dryer he would find me upstairs and bring me a towel.  The staff is friendly, the gym is clean, the price is fair.  Good job Gold's!

Ok, so first off, the ambiance.  Incredible.  Definitely fits the city, but is even more dramatic with its exposed duct work and true city feeling.  I loved the urban feel of the salon.  The front desk girls were friendly and never stopped smiling.  I had a mens cut, scalp massage and conditioning treatment by Kyle.  He is a GREAT stylist.  He knows his stuff and certainly made me feel comfortable and also made me look better when i left then when i had walked in which is exactly the results everyone wants.  I would recommend him to anyone.  He also cut and highlighted and colored my mom's hair and she looked absolutely beautiful.. She said she felt pampered.  If you want a great color, highlight, cut or any other service go see Kyle.   I also saw DeAnna for a facial peel and dermabrasion treatment.  She was calm and relaxing and made my skin glow.  She wasn't pushy about products and also offered me tips to keep myself looking great.   Overall, i loved this place!

Me and my partner absolutely LOVE it here.  They treat us great and the food is amazing.  I almost always get the steak filet which comes on a bed of mashed potatoes with asparagus and bone marrow butter.  It's amazing!   Kat, she's our favorite, will make you feel welcome and comfortable!  Highly recommended.

I really wanted to like this place but i had an awful first experience, and that's enough to turn me off.  Yep, i had the dreaded, HAIR IN MY SOUP!  Then the staff looked at me like it was my fault.  WTF, take it away and comp it.  Don't you dare try to not take full responsibility.  It can happen, i understand, but it's your job to make it right.
