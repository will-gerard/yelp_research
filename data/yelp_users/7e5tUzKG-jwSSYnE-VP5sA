I prefer Sunshine Dental over all others. The staff is nice and respectful, and their automated reminder system is great to keep me reminded. They do great work at reasonable prices.  I don't like being made to wait, and every time I come in to my appointment, I don't have to. I get in right away, I love that.

I have been to this place a few times in the past and the sushi was always good. I hadn't been back in almost 2 years when we went yesterday.  I was actually kind of shocked at how badly the decor and the cleanliness of the place had gone downhill. The bathrooms were disgusting, and looks like they hadn't been cleaned in a couple of days. The tables were sticky, the floor was sticky, the silverware was dirty and so were the glasses. This place needs to be cleaned thoroughly and needs to give instructions to their staff on how to clean because this place was really gross. We almost got up and left because of that.   The waitress was very nice, but barely spoke any English. She got our order wrong, and what we ordered first as an appetizer came about the same time we had finished eating and we got our bill. Our kids meal was extremely late, and came just as we were finishing our meal. It was all messed up.  I got to say the food was pretty decent, the Las Vegas roll was good and everything we had was decent it's just not enough for me anymore. I can't go to a place that feels disgusting to sit in.

This place was spectacular...after reading the mixed reviews, I wasn't hesitant, but certainly not over the moon excited about going.  The place is fantastic, and it exceeded my expectations. That's what its all about right? Expectations?  I had the bison tongue, foie with buckwheat pancakes and the horse tartare for my main. The foie was simply fantastic...balanced, rich and classy. Everything else was great too. We had a nice Bordeaux  GREAT food, GREAT atmosphere, GREAT staff. Can I give it 6 stars?

On the second day of our three-week road trip, we were passing through Las Vegas. We had a brake and rotor issue that the previous dealership had told us was fine and didn't present any problems, it wasn't a safety issue.  The previous dealership also told us that the brake issue was not covered by warranty.   As we got to Las Vegas, I decided I couldn't handle the brake vibration and took it in to this dealership in order to get the repairs done.   Tim McFadden was a really cool service manager. He listened to my complaint, got my vehicle right in and I was done within an hour and a half, all without an appointment. He was actually really easy to talk to, pretty cool guy.   He blew me away by telling me that he got my brakes and rotors replaced free of charge as a warranty issue. I was at 31k miles.   Frankly, I'm still in shock. I can't believe they would do that for me, and I'm extremely grateful. Do yourself a favor and use these guys, they are a class act.

I love this plane for the food and drink. The Internet is pretty bad though. Fortunately I rarely come here for the Internet.

We waited for 75 minutes and weren't even close to being seated. The front desk looked and acted clueless. It was truly unbelievable. We left hungry and frustrated.   The food looked really really good though.

I signed up as a member this week. I'm pretty impressed so far..great internet, great coffee and wine bar scene. Its definitely my kind of place. So many other co working spaces and coffee shops are so crowded and filled with 20-30 year olds, its too young for me.  Looking forward to more good times here!

now that I have been here for a year, I can absolutely recommend this place. "AMAZING" is such an insufficient word. The food is excellent, not what you would expect in a co-working space, the drinks are fantastic and the people are wonderful......this place is a DESTINATION, a place to work, think, drink and gain inspiration.  There is a quiet dignity/understated elegance to this place. I am certainly glad I belong....

The Good: it's a beautiful space, very well laid out. Lots of money went into this place. The different vendors are well spaced. I would even say it's beautiful.   The Bad: frankly, everything food is pretty bad here. at the yard, I had the French  dip and it was served with the au jus poured over the sandwich, which made it impossible to eat with your hands because it was so soggy.  I got stomach cramps afterward and had the runs for 3 hours afterwards.   I had a glass of wine here, overpriced ken wright Pinot for $15 for a 6 oz pour. The service was bad, I had to wait 7 minutes for someone to ask me if I wanted a drink. The barkeep didn't even know the menu, or where to find that particular wine. He had to go ask somebody. Then the glass was not clean at all.....there were particulate strands inside and out with whatever they wiped it with. I poured it into another cup.   I had coffee afterwards, I asked for a vanilla latte, they gave me an overly sweet chocolate mocha.   The Ugly: service here is horrible, all of the servers are uninspired and have really bad, crooked and unkempt teeth.   I'm sorry to be so petty, I'm just really disappointed. I had high hopes for this place, but it's really bad. I hope it gets better.
