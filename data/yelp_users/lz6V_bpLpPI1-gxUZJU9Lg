Wow!!! Went here to up-date my health records after 20 years. Parked in covered parking for patient and visitors. At first I thought it was for staff only. Had no problem finding Enrollment and Eligibility office because of easy to read and properly placed signs. Gave them my drivers license and DD 214 waited about 5 min and was ushered to the back where I was greeted by name. Pulled me up on the computer, answered a few pertinent questions and signed a few forms and Voila...all done. Even scheduled my next appt. and given several pamphlets to help with new changes to their system. Discovered I was fully covered by Veterans insurance even eye care. In and out in under 1 hour. Facility is very clean and staff is friendly and helpful! Even have a Starbucks! I personally recommend this hospital to all veterans to this newly revamped facility!! Thank you Veterans Administration!

2nd visit and starting to find the glitches. First of all, most of the offices are named after precious stones...jade, turquoise, ruby etc. instead of numbers. I'm guessing to help vets remember where to go. Though the signs are clearly labeled some offices are located in obscure places and easy to walk right by which is what happened to me. I walked the entire length of the hospital only to find that the office was behind a wall next to the entrance where I came in.  After a short wait was able to see my assigned Dr. for my physical. He was very thorough and was constantly typing while asking me questions. Slight language barrier, I think he is of Russian descent. He scribbled some info on a piece of paper and I was told to give it to the receptionist who assured me he could translate the scribbles.  He got everything wrong and I had to correct him! If he had any sense he should have spoken directly to the doctor! A mistake here would definitely cause some serious problems! My next step was to get my blood drawn and my lungs x-rayed. It went smoothly until it came time to go to my follow up 8am appt. 2 weeks later. Parking was a nightmare and had to park in a no parking zone, ran in to check in then parked in the adjoining Indian School park. My Dr did not say anything about my blood or lung X-ray until I questioned him to which he responded by saying, "if I don't say anything about your blood or lungs you are fine. To be continued.... My thumbs are tired so I'll quit for now.

Didn't feel like coffee, tea or food today. Just craving some good orange juice so I bought a 15.2oz bottle of "Evolution" brand cold pressed, high pressure processed orange juice for $5+tax. They saw me coming that's for sure.What a joke! Didn't taste any better than $.99 generic orange juice concentrate you can buy at any store! Boooo What a rip off! Actually the flavor wasn't all that bad but not $5.00 worth, maybe $3.00.

I will keep this review simple, just like this nice restaurant. Plenty of parking area, greeted nicely, we ate on the patio. The food was freshly prepared and quite substantial (especially the skillets) Good value and ambiance. All in all a pleasant experience.

Where to begin! Let's start with accommodations. I would not consider taking a large party (4+) as there is insufficient room, unless you are willing to have split seating arrangements or sit in the aisle. It was quite busy when my son and I arrived about 9am. We waited in the aisle as a party of 6 or 7 were just leaving. 3 were seated in the aisle and the extra chairs needed to be removed. Once seated  (directly under the a/c vent) we were greeted nicely and provided with menus. Orange juice and water were brought out quickly after our beverage order and after perusing the menu, we decided on a cheese omelet w/chili, 2 eggs and ham with a 1/2 order of biscuits and gravy on the side. Mine came with a waffle and toast. Sounds good doesn't it? We did too! Surprise..surprise!  Absolutely devoid of any flavor! That was somewhat corrected with liberal and copious amounts of salt, pepper and Tabasco. Nothing we could do with the waffle but drown it in a pool of cold generic syrup.  The items were brought out separately? First to arrive were the 2 small thin dried out discs of ham? The rest came out  one at a time as the order was completed. We had to eat quickly with the a/c blowing directly on our food. To no avail!  We could not eat fast enough and the food taste like it came out of the fridge. My egg yolk solidified before I could eat it! My son liked his omelet w/chili though it got cold too. No wonder it was the only table open when we arrived. We actually wanted to move but nothing was available. The total for all this? Ta Da!! Only $18.85 plus tip. The only redeeming factor were the pleasant and accommodating wait staff. Our hats off to you all for having to serve this stuff with a smile!  We both wished we would have stayed home and made our own and I suggest you do the same or go to any fast food joint! (note) Stay away from the south east corner booth unless it's 110 degrees outside and/or you like your food cold! . Have a nice day all!

Actually the $3.99 pizza from Pizza Patron looked pretty darn good when I opened the box. It was hot but I noticed immediately, no pizza aroma! Adequate amount of pepperonis and cheese and the crust looked good too but had absolutely no flavor...none! Like a generic pizza..Possible imitation cheese, pepperonis, sauce and dough. I sprinkled copious amounts of garlic salt/powder and crushed red peppers all over it to give it some flavor. I guess if you don't mind doing that it's worth $3.99. Prob better to go across the street to Little Caesar's for $4.99! The star is for me and my seasoning additions! Haha Could give another star for convenience but parking is bad!

Want friendly service, good prices, safe location? Don't stop,keep going! Located in a strip mall near a smoke shop and a QT many unsavory characters milling around. Recently moved nearby and explained that I like Chinese food and need a go to place for my fix. I ordered the lunch special take-out. Thinking they would like my return business, they would make my order especially robust. WRONG! Upon opening, found egg rolls missing, small scoop of fried rice and lo mien and 2 small pieces of beef with broccoli and as a bonus...all cold and bland. Also missing, fork, napkins, condiments and the traditional fortune cookie. No drink order. Total, almost $9! WOW. No wonder it's always empty of customers. Too bad! :-(

Went to New Tokyo Food Market today for some Japanese staples...Miso soup, nori (dried seaweed), Osenbei (flavored rice crackers), Furikake (dried seasoning mix) and Panko bread crumbs for Tempura recipes and they carry many other hard to find Japanese products. Prices are very reasonable and most products are authentic and not Americanized versions. Owner came over and helped us with our selections without being asked! Very helpful and nice!  Highly recommend this market located on S/E corner of 35th Ave. and Northern. Parking area is limited however! Banzai!!!!

Came here specifically for Kimchi and bought 2 jars. They are homemade and taste like it. Not much of a selection being late on a Sunday afternoon. Business was bustling and many customers stocking up with Asian staples for the week. Friendly owners and workers too. No language barriers. It's a stand alone place and is kinda small but ample parking in the mostly dirt parking lot. Not the best Kimchi I've had but it will do in a pinch.

Note: as the kimchi sat in the refrigerator for a few days, the flavors developed fully from the fermentation process. It is tasting mighty fine now!

We went to the KFC located at Hayden and Indian School about 2pm on a Sunday and boy o boy what a big time disappointment! The order taker was so anxious to take our order that she would not allow us to peruse the menu on the wall behind her even though we stood a good 15 feet from her. She kept rambling about the specials and was very distracting and annoying. After some deliberation we decided on the $5 fill up (3 piece tenders, mashed potatoes and biscuit) and  a $8 (3 piece dinner, 3 thighs original recipe) which came with a tiny mashed potatoes and gravy, small cole slaw and a dry biscuit.  Definition of a chicken is an adult bird over 1 year old..definition of a pullet is under 1 year old and a chick is 6 months or less. The thighs were from a chick. I could put all 3 thighs in the palm of my hand and still see my fingers. After removing the bones there was 3 bites of chicken. I almost felt guilty eating a chick not to mention everything was cold! Dam what a waste of $15! I hope this is not typical of all KFC's.  Don't waste your money here.

HEY all you Yelpers out there... Howz come it always seems that whenever a restaurant, diner or eatery hits on a successful recipe they wanna tweek it?  Even a lowly place like Pete's is no exception. Years ago, back in the 60's, they hit on one at Pete's. The fried shrimps were outstanding! Nice large juicy shrimps coated in a light crispy batter similar to tempura made it destination dining. Being inexpensive and delicious they appealed to the masses. When I returned from a tour in the USMC, it was beckoning for me to return. Went to the one on South Central and ordered a large shrimp and chips only to find heavily battered deep fried minced shrimps. Disappointed I ate them anyways. Soon, I got used them and continued to go to Pete's. Now fast forward to the present.  They are now mass produced minced shrimps coated with bread crumbs then stamped into the shape of a shrimp and deep fried, identical to frozen ones found at any grocery store except they are now more expensive and come with only a handful of  French fries! So sad,,,not likely to return unless someone else picks up the tab. I never turn down free food usually! Progress? Bah!  2 stars for the food being hot and convenient.

My daughter brought me here for a belated Father's day lunch. Wow! I couldn't believe my eyes. Almost drove right by. Complete and total make over inside and out. Even a new electric sign out front. They must have got new deep fryers too...the food tasted better than usual. You can actually see shrimp inside the crust. I got a 7 piece lunch combo. (5 shrimp and 2 oysters) with a pile of fries and Pete's sauce. I brought some Tabasco with me to spice it up a little.  My daughter had the 3 piece fish and chips. Everything was hot and crispy and the oysters were plump and juicy. Make sure you bring cash though, CASH ONLY! They have an ATM on site but will hit you up for $2.50. I will be returning more often cash in hand. Hope you all do the same. Order the oysters...Plump and juicy but be careful when you bite into it or you will squirt hot juice everywhere!  ENJOY!

Lesley greeted me on the drive thru and asked me politely what I would like to order. I told her 4 tacos with 2 free tacos with a coupon. I was told that they are no longer 2 tacos for 99 cents they are now $1.19 for 2 tacos. Still really not a bad deal. Got 6 tacos  for  $2.59. Yes, they are not the best but when when you're hungry it fills in the cracks. They were hot and crispy and recieved extra hot sauce and napkins. Now where can you get fresh hot tacos with no hassle? In and out in less than 5 min. And she had a big smile that would melt a mountain of daily problems!  Thank you Lesley

Good food and value. Nothing fancy. Greeted nicely and seated immediately. Menu and drinks followed. Breakfast was good. I had the sausage and 3 eggs over easy, hash browns and a side of biscuits and gravy with toast and jelly. I will go back. They also have an all you can eat menu.

My oldest daughter took her mom and sister out for a belated Mother's Day lunch to On the Border on Bell Rd. I stayed at home and waited for any left overs. When they returned, they gave me a bag that was quite heavy and I thought they felt bad for me so they purchased an entire entree for me. Wrong...It was their left over entree's. I was hungry so I opened the bag and sadly discovered about 7 lbs. of what tasted like canned refried beans and partially eaten enchiladas and burritos. None of it was flavorful cold so I reheated it in the microwave and there was absolutely no improvement in flavor so I tossed it. Sounded like a brick when it landed! YUK!!! Save the trip and go to Fry's and get some $.99 Banquet T.V. dinners. I felt really bad for all of them especially on this special occasion! Oh well, at least I know where NOT to go if they take me out for Father's day lunch. I hope my daughter isn't angry at me for writing this but I wanted to give you Yelpers a heads up!  They should rename the restaurant  "Borderline Mexican Cantina" Ha Ha

Did I miss something or what? My son brought me here for a late lunch after a Dbacks game. Passed on Chinese which I regret now. We purchased 2 doubles, a single, 3 FF's animal style and 2 large drinks to go. Total...$23 and change! I got the single thinking it would be enough for me. My mouth was watering thinking about a nice thick juicy burger. Wrong! The only thing juicy was the lettuce and tomatoes. I opened the burger to discover a 3 1/2 inch diameter, thin wafer of meat, dry as a bone. Some parts I could actually see through. It was thinner than McD's. 1/8th pounder? I couldn't even taste it. I think you need to order the triple to taste the meat. By the time we got home (5 min.) the cheese on the FF's congealed into one big glob. I ate it cause I was still hungry after the burger. I ate it like a potato pancake. It was unappealing but tasted OK. My son liked his meal?  I would go to BK's, McD's or Pete's any day of the week at 1/3 the price. Sorry son!

This is kind of an elaborate review of the Little Caesar's on the corner of Indian School road and 83rd ave. I hope it isn't indicative of all the others. I hate to admit, I have been coming here off and on for about 10-12 yrs. It is close by and located in a dirty strip mall between a rib shack and a Dollar store and the parking area is shared with a Food City (closed now) and a Chinese food restaurant. Needless to say parking is at a premium especially evenings and Friday nights. I only go there when I don't feel like cooking dinner or there is nothing in the frig. (plus it's cheap $5 for a lg. pepperoni)  I usually call in advance for my order and it is always ready and on time because after looking for a place to park and going to the counter passing a hoard to the counter takes about 20 to 30 min. The interior is about the size of an elevator and is packed like sardines. (Big time B. O.)  After making it to the counter and waiting to pick up my order I get a chance to watch the kitchen staff. Unlike most of the customers, I am about 6ft. tall and have a good vantage point. If you want to eat your pizza don't look. Just put your blinds on and leave quickly. Hopefully your car is still there. But if you decide to look you will notice food prep without gloves, no hair nets, cashiers handling food after handling money, staff eating while working, half eaten pizzas on working surfaces, phone orders being taken while eating or boxing up your order, flies in the window dead and alive, walls and floors thick with grime, kitchen area and equipment filthy with old grease, workers unkempt, dirty and disheveled looking. Pretty sad, to say the least, but surprisingly I have never gotten "physically" ill ( I think I have built up a tolerance/ immunity or lucky) and the pizzas taste pretty darn good and hot. They have never messed up my order either. AMAZING!! If you do decide to go...enter at your own risk.  I will probably go there again and push my luck. I just wish they would clean up their act!!! Good luck!

Everyone, heads up! I used be a loyal customer of Water Mill Express because they service the machines daily, clean and convinient but recently noticed the water tasted off and also noticed the daily service stickers are missing. Checked other locations too. Tried to contact by phone as before but no longer an option, only Email. So I wrote them about my concerns and they just side stepped my questions and said they would send me some free tokens that I didn't ask for. That was 2 weeks ago. No tokens. My summation is that they no longer service the machines daily as before and am now going to a nearby Water Store. It's a little more expensive and not as convenient but at least I know the water is good quality and tastes better too! I recommend you all do the same!!!  Watermill is now exactly like the Glacier water machines outside of every Circle K and Walgreens which are rarely if ever serviced!

I received a buy one entree, get one free coupon for joining their fan club membership so my son and I went this morning for breakfast. Got there around 9am. Greeted and seated immediately in a nice booth. Waitress was quite knowledgeable and took our order after giving us time to peruse the menu. I ordered the Country fried steak and eggs which comes with OJ, country potatoes and toast as did my sons breakfast which he ordered the standard bacon and eggs with an extra egg. We both agreed that the breakfast was OK, both our potato sides were cold. I had a small thick dollop of gravy on my country fried steak, which was quite good but had to ask for extra gravy. Put in a serving bowl it was so thick it wouldn't pour so I used a spoon. I spread it on my Country fried steak with a butter knife much like you would a piece of toast. Weird! Watch out for the coffee. If you are offered flavored coffee it is extra. Hidden charges for everything. In other words, even with the coupon the total came to almost $20.00. for 2 average breakfasts. (tip, cancer donation, etc.) I had to do a double take on the check to see if they included the coupon. Nothing really bad but nothing really good either. I should have known better! Probably not coming back. My son seconds the motion.

This place is great especially for children's parties. We went there for my granddaughter's 4th birthday and a party of 10. Large, clean and well lit parking area, entrance has several wide glass doors, ordering and pick up areas easy and well defined with plenty of proficient staff, cooking area appeared clean and efficient, dining area was always kept clean and condiment tables always kept fully stocked. Lots of well maintained arcade type games as well as some rides. You can trade in your winning ticket stubs for some nice prizes at the toy store. Some TVs scattered through out the dining area. You place your order and you receive a beeper to notify you when your pizza is ready. If you have numerous pizzas for a large party the friendly staff will assist you with no hesitation. We all had a good time and the pizzas and wings were good too! BTW you can reserve a table and order in advance if you would like.  Just walk in and the party is on!  I feel like I am doing a paid promotion for Peter Piper Pizza but I am not...this actually happened yesterday @ 6:00 pm.! Thanks Peter Piper!

This diner deserves 3 stars but I am adding 1 star because of my son. Jeff bought me breakfast and it was no special occasion. Cool huh!  We had gone fishing earlier and he lost a huge bass and I did too. Good thing we don't have to depend on our fishing or hunting prowess for food like some people. We would probably starve. Anyway, back to the diner. We had built up a pretty good appetite and were looking for a good breakfast spot. Black Bear Diner came to mind from previous Yelp reviews. I chose the country fried steak and eggs, Jeff chose the thick sliced smoked bacon and eggs. Both breakfasts were ok but definitely not worth the $9.00 apiece price tag. The drinks and breakfast came out in less than 5 min. You read right, 5 MIN. So quick in fact, it made me suspicious and cautious. Everything was warm and APPEARED freshly made but the speed at which they came out pointed to pre-made, nuked or heat lamped. Probably left over from the early morning crowd and not being regulars we were given the left overs. We arrived about 9am.  At least Waffle House is cooked to order!  If you are not going to serve a freshly made product, then the price should reflect that and inform the customer! Boy, that would be a first. The waitress would say, "Excuse me, we made too much hash browns, chicken fried steak and biscuits this morning. Would you like a 50% discount on your meal or would you prefer freshly made at full price?" I would choose the former in a heart beat! So essentially my son paid a total of $22.00 + tip for left overs. My son works very hard for his money and to take his money using deceptive practices really pisses me off! I recouped some of the price by using all the butter and jelly on the dry baseball sized thing they call a biscuit! I am so pissed off right now I am taking away another star. No..make that 2 stars. LOSERS! I can't believe I told the waitress thank you... Makes me gag. It's no wonder fast food places flourish.

Went here about 1pm on Sunday not very crowded and seated immediately. Menus and drinks followed. Service remained good throughout our visit. That's where the good stopped. The food?....well, let me just say this; "Don't waste your money!" Quality and quantity suffers greatly here. Nothing remotely Japanese at Kabuki only the name! Still hungry when we left and $35 lighter. No drink order either. The cooks here need to go to Japan to see how Japanese food is really crafted! I dislike having that feeling I just got ripped off. Dam!!!

WARNING fellow Yelpers! The 4 star rating is very deceptive. If you have ever read any of my previous reviews you know I don't pull any punches. I tell it just the way it is. They served me a rotten smelly piece of yellowing NY strip steak with my breakfast. Had it removed and replaced with rotten smelly sausage links and patties. The gravy for the biscuits had the same stench as the rotten meat. I think they used the juice from the putrid meat to flavor the gravy. The odor was so bad it was triggering our gag reflexes continuously! Absolutely disgusting and ruined our appetite completely. Hoping to salvage some of the food, I scraped my remaining food onto the toast plate so it would not be contaminated by the smelly steak juice. It didn't help! My son could not finish his breakfast either! They did remove the steak from the bill but charged for the smelly sausage. Total for this garbage was over $20. We were both wondering why there were numerous full plates of food on various tables but no customers were seated there. I think after one whiff they just up and left. Good for them...saved a trip to the ER! The busser would quickly scoop them up as they left. After we gave the busser our unfinished plates of garbage you could still detect the smell of rotten meat. YUCK!  No wonder they are dog friendly... They're probably cadaver dogs! Ha ha We prob won't be able to eat a traditional type breakfast for weeks if not months!

We went to the KFC on Chandler Blvd. & the I-101 to get the 8 piece Family meal $19.99 + .99 (10 piece tender bites on special) for our visit to my 96 yr. old mother in law on Sunday. She loves KFC!  I was quite disappointed in the price to quantity ratio. All 8 pieces of chicken fit in the same size box as the 4 piece biscuit box. The 3 chicken legs and 2 thighs looked the same size as wing drumettes. The 2 wings would not keep a sparrow aloft. The breast, although a little larger, was dry. The 10 piece Tender bites were also dry and the crust had come off in the cooking process. The sides were ok. Cole slaw, 4 dry biscuits, potatoes and gravy. I could have consumed all the chicken myself and still have room for sides and dessert and I'm not a heavy eater.  I have visited many KFC's and they are all the same. It's not just this location.  Absolutely NOT worth the $21.00+tax for me but worth every penny for the smile on my mother in law's face! :-)

Judging by the other reviews for this Subway I'm glad I didn't purchase anything.  I just needed to make an emergency pit stop and was turned away because I didn't buy anything. I held my temper and my urine till I got home 45 min away! Ran a couple red lights but made it safely home. Yes sir! Boooo to Subway!

I read the review that Steven E. wrote only minutes ago and quite frankly I am so embarrassed by the filthy conditions of this eatery. As you know, the Japanese take extreme  pride in cleanliness and neatness. This restaurant  is a disgrace to the Japanese culture and community at large. I have not eaten there nor will I unless they clean up their act! The owner, if he is Japanese, should consider hari kari. I hope he hasn't damaged our reputation too badly! My suggestion is to close down for a couple days and scrub, clean and polish from top to bottom and keep it that way! My apologies  to the loyal patrons for this sacrilege.

My daughter took me to Long John Silver's, (attached to an A &W BTW), at my request for a belated Father's Day lunch. Boy...what a terrible mistake! I should have known better because several years ago I had pretty much the same experience. Thinking it was old oil to blame for the grease laden sponges they called fish and shrimp, I was sure this different location would be better. WRONG!!! Absolutely identical. I got the 2 piece meal which included 2 pieces of fish, cole slaw, fries and added 3 shrimp. The fish, shrimp and fries probably began previously frozen but hey...if you use old oil that you fried french fries, onion rings, hush puppies, fish and shrimp in, all day and night  long in, well.... YUK! I could feel my arteries hardening with each bite! The once 3oz. fish fillet was transformed into an 8oz. slab of battered lard as well as everything else that was fried. I know that economic times are tough but come on...use fresh oil and your customers will return in droves. There were only 2 other customers in the dual type restaurant.  Neither of us finished our meal! Total tab was $14.08 with 4 coupons received in the mail. (would have paid almost $20 without coupons) Needless to say, definitely my last visit to LJS ever. Hope I live long enough to continue to avoid them and hope you all do the same!

My daughter and I went on Saturday morning July 16th (11am opening time) to get some hot fresh Asian food. Lots of customers were already there but not sure why unless they were all first timers. Some hot foods were cold in the middle like the egg rolls, fried dumplings, etc. Actually most of the food tasted reheated, now that I think about it. Maybe left over from the night or day before. NOTHING SEEMED TO BE CRISPY. Sure there was lots of food but it was not as good as we hoped. The meals cost us about $16.00 for both of us but we didn't get $16.00 worth of food. We tried a little of almost everything that looked good but nothing was worth seconds. We didn't try the Hibachi grill though. The best part of the meal was the plentiful and fresh fruit bar. Can't really cheat on that. The restaurant was pretty clean except my table was sticky on the edge. The bathroom was clean but I suspect it was because it was still early.  As we left we wished it would have been better as we live nearby. Oh well.

Located in a non-descript strip mall next to a smoke shop and a now defunct music store it oozes mom and pop homemade Mexican food. 7 or 8 tables, some Hispanic memorabilia scattered around with the counter/order area in the back. My wife was feeling I'll and she was craving a bowl of hot menudo blanco. I remembered this place under a different name and suggested it but as you can see by the one star rating it fell far short. I waited in the car figuring she would be out in a couple minutes, but after waiting about 15 min and seeing through the window, only 3 customers seated and already eating, I had to investigate. As I sat next to her she said no blanco menudo, only rojo! I asked her what was taking so long?...it should only take 2 min to ladle up an order of menudo. I think they ran down the street to Food City and purchased a can of Juanita's menudo. I also noticed they had crossed out the $5.95 price and inserted $6.95 on the menu. Finally received our to go order after 20 min. and left with our prize. Omg...32oz of cold, flavorless red water soaked slimy tripe and a few kernels of hominy..that's it!  Juanita's canned menudo is better and it is bad! My wife was so disappointed, hungry and ill she was almost in tears which prompted me to "call" the owner and write this review. I can't repeat what I said here for fear of being flagged but I think you get the idea. Not good! Tortillas are store bought too but that's prob a good thing. I don't trust this place! Steer clear!  You have been warned.
