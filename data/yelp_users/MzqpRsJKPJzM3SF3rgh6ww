L says - "Chef Jeremy's passion for food was on full display and it was a remarkable experience. This is the best steak in town."  J says- "Anyone can put vegetables on a plate, but it takes a true chef to be up for the challenge of a 5 course vegan meal. It was the best meal yet."   First Impression/ambiance Nestled in the grounds of the Fairmont Princess, the restaurant was elegant and the outdoor booth was the perfect spot for date night.   Drinks The Sommelier was very helpful with the wine pairings.  He brought several wines and we couldn't go wrong with any of his choices. L went for a red and J went with a white. Sadly, we did not remember the brand. Both were very excellent!   Food - The first item brought to the table was a small portion of shoestring French fries with 3 different dipping sauces: a house made ketchup, an aioli, and a house sauce which appeared to be half of each of the previously mentioned sauces mixed. J stuck to the ketchup while L enjoyed all 3. The next item was an "amuse Buche" a steak tartar in endive for L and a vegan beet tartar with some strawberry balsamic reduction for J. J loved the creativeness of the chef and the beet tartar. The next course was a mushroom soup which the chef was kind enough to make a special vegan version for J. The soup was so delicate yet flavorful it was heaven in a bowl. L loves mushrooms so he was also very pleased. The next item was a strawberry basil granita to cleanse the palate. Both J and L thought this was very refreshing. Next was a salad course. J's salad was a fresh bed of mixed greens with shaved radish, cucumber and some lentils while L's was a mixed green with avocado. Both excellent options. The main dish was next. L had a phenomenal steak that with roasted cipolini onions with mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked to medium rare perfection and was so flavorful on its own without any sauce or condiments (just as a great steak should be). J was served a cauliflower steak with chimichurri sauce, crispy Brussels sprouts, green beans, zucchini ribbons, grapefruit segments and a red pepper coulis. Again, J was impressed. The attention to detail and the perfect combination of flavors was amazing. For dessert we chose a selection of house made vegan ice creams.   Service L called in advance and asked to talk to the Chef regarding J's particular diet. L left a voicemail and Chef Jeremy Macmillan returned his call a few hours later. It was a delightful conversation to say the least and L left the conversation excited with anticipation. Chef Jeremy said he was very excited for creating the menu and meeting us. Our hostess was very gracious and took us to a booth in a quiet area per L's request. The sommelier, as previously mentioned, knew the ins and outs of wine and learning about the regions from each wine offered was a treat. The servers were very attentive to our waters and our plates. Chef Jeremy came out to greet us towards the end of our meal to check up on us and made sure we were taken care of. It was a pleasure meeting you kind sir! Overall service was top notch as expected from a fine dining restaurant. Michael Mina, you have a great chef at your disposable! We will certainly be back to see what else Chef Macmillan has cooked up his sleeve.

J says - "Save your money and go to SomeBurros down the street"  L says - "Skip this one and go to the next Mexican restaurant on your list"   Due to its glowing reviews on Yelp, we were excited to try La Hacienda. It is located at the Fairmont Princess and with a past outstanding dining experience at Bourbon Steak, we wanted to give this a shot. Unfortunately, we arrived at the Fairmont Princess excited but left disappointed.   First Impression/Ambiance - Nice decor and very South West.  The plate settings were very nice and we liked the Desert Landscape Centerpiece.   Food  First, we were told that the Kitchen was not able to make Vegetarian Tacos. Even though, there were Tacos and a Grilled Vegetable Plate on the menu.   CHIPS AND SALSA - Complimentary and the best part of our meal. Chips tasted very fresh and flavorful. The salsa was very smooth and had many bold flavors.   VEGETABLE FAJITAS - It arrived in a tiny skillet on a plate with rice, guacamole, and a little extra salsa. Flour tortillas arrived but looked translucent. They seem to be made fresh but oily and under cooked.  HALIBUT PLATE - The Halibut plate looked delicious. L was ready to go to town but was immediately disappointed on the first bite. The vegetable quinoa was good but the halibut was over cooked and dry. Even with the chimichurri sauce, L said the plate was just ok and tasted very bland.   Service - The hostess was very friendly but we found it interesting how she initially sat us in a dark corner of the restaurant, when we were the only diners at the time.  We asked to be seated by the window with much more adequate lighting and the hostess paused as if it would be a problem. On a good note, our waters were filled to the top consistently and our plates were cleared swiftly when we were done. However, when we did ask the busser/food runner if the Tortillas normally looked like this, she replied "I will ask the Chef". We waited, skipped dessert, paid our dinner bill, and left without knowing.   For an expensive menu and a restaurant at the Fairmont Princess, this was overall a sad disappointment. We are surprised that so many diners have enjoyed their experiences here.

L says - "without any doubt...a 5 Star dental practice. McAdams Dental truly does set the standard for how dental practices should be. We are happy to say, we have found THE Dental Practice and there is no need to look elsewhere."  J says- "I wish I would have come to McAdams Dental sooner. Definitely the right place for somebody with dental anxiety. McAdams Dental has top notch professionals who are all very informative, friendly, and most importantly ensure patient comfort throughout the process."  First Impression/Ambiance  We decided it was time to find a new Dentist after more than a few unsatisfactory experiences with our current dentist. We looked online, typed in top rated dentists on Yelp, and McAdams Dental Inc was at the top of list. We read the reviews and saw nothing but great recommendations and 5 Stars! We came initially for a regular check-up and cleaning and left very impressed. In fact, we ended up booking a Teeth Whitening as well!  The dental office was warm and inviting. The facility is very clean and comfortable.   Services - Cleaning  Lindsey was L's hygienist - Lindsey was very nice, gentle, and provided the best cleaning experience L has ever had. L said the tooth cleaning was painless and his mouth never felt cleaner. Lindsey also did a great job of educating L on ways to keep the teeth and gums healthier, such as changing a few habits and showing L the proper brushing technique in using an electric toothbrush.   Jaime was J's hygienist -J hadn't been to the dentist in a couple of years and was very nervous. Jaime explained this office took pride in helping patients overcome dental anxiety. Jaime is knowledgeable, friendly, and has a very calm demeanor. She explained every instrument and step in the appointment. This helped put J at ease. Before J knew it her appointment was over and her teeth felt so clean!      Dr. McAdams - Toward the end of each appointment, Dr. McAdams completed the oral exam. Dr. McAdams was very kind, gentle and thorough. He displays the utmost professionalism. He made sure all of our questions were answered before we left. Dr. McAdams valued our input and gave us honest feedback on issues we were concerned about. You can tell he is passionate about dentistry and patient care. He even gave us a little info regarding the architecture of the office. This just proves that there is thought behind every detail in the office.
