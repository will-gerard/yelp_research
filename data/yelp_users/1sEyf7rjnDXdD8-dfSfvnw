I have been to Ra many times and it's usually very consistent with a great atmosphere.  When I visited this location everything was pretty much okay although the tables could've been a little bit more cleaner, smudging and spreading the food on the table does not really make it cleaner! The food is great as usual BUT the reason why they got the two stars and disturbed me the most was when we left I saw one of the sushi chefs working with no gloves!!! He served sushi, cut veggies, handling the ginger and the food with HIS BARE HANDS!!! Non of the managers/ staff or waitresses didn't say anything or just didn't care!! I still love Ra and will probably go back no question about it but not to this location!!

We stayed here where we began a two-week bus tour. We had a double room that was large with refrigerator, microwave, flat-screen TV, iron/ironing board, desk with swivel chair and USB ports and free wi-fi. The beds were excellent. The shower had grab bars. There is a continental breakfast buffet for a charge. There is a great pool.

The owner was incredibly rude to me. My daughter had an issue with his place so I called to complain and not only did he did not seem to care, he was actually dismissive. When I said that my last resort was writing an online review of my experience, he started screaming "YOU DON'T THREATEN ME!! DON'T YOU EVER THREATEN ME!!!!"  I won't ever be back of course, and I make it a point to let others know of his outrageous behavior.

I have to say it was a bit difficult to find since its under the W hotel and if you don't pay attention you'll miss it.  Parking was a bit difficult as well and it was only Sunday night but it was worth it.  Nice atmosphere and the staff is very accommodating and helpful.  The food is delicious and the fish is so fresh and the portions are just right.  It's def worth another visit since we know where it is now : )

I spilled a coke on the passenger seat of my car last week and stained it. I was very upset because I love my car and the seat looked awful. Someone told me to take it to clean freak  Car Wash.  They shampooed all my seats and carpets, they did a great job. Next time I will have them Hand Wax the outside of the car because it's starting to look dull. They did a test spot for me and showed me how good it will look. All the employees treated me very well.
