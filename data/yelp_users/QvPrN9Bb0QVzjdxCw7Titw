I went into kinkos the other day to have my baby shower invitations printed. When we walked in we were greeted right away by Trevor and he explained to me that he had a large printing project ahead of time and that mine wouldn't be ready until the next day. I wanted to see what they would look like before I completely committed to it but since the color printer was being used he was not able to do that for me. Instead he set me up at a self service printer. Well, the printer kept malfunctioning and Trevor kept running back to help us until he finally just said "you know my color printer is free now so I can just do this for you really quickly". As I looked around during everything there were customers everywhere and I noticed that Trevor was running around helping everyone as quickly as possible. I asked him "are you working alone today?" he just shook his head no. Finally, when I was almost done (about 45 minutes later) another worker came out from the back and decided he was going to help some guests. The only reason I'm giving this five stars is because Trevor was so efficient and helpful and was clearly the only one working hard that day. I don't know if I would have gotten the same customer service had he not been working that day. (By the way, my invitations came out perfect!)

So this probably the fourth time I've gone and they messed up my order. All I wanted was a cheeseburger with mayo added to it. Well, my cheeseburger doesn't have cheese or mayo which I can look passed since its a drive thru, but my burger is absolutely cold! The 1 star is for customer service because everyone is friendly. So disappointing.

So I'm personally going through some financial difficulties and am barely able to afford feeding myself let alone my pet rabbit. I tried to call and make an appointment to give her up for adoption on multiple occasions and got no answer or returned calls after leaving multiple voicemails. I decided to try and take her down to the facility and see if they'll take her and they want to charge me $60 for giving her up for adoption. I explained to them that I am going through hard times and don't have $60 but also don't have money to feed her properly and am in the middle of moving and have no space for her where I'm moving to. They didn't care and told me that I still need to make an appointment and pay them. So now my poor rabbit is stressed out from the car ride there and back home and I still don't have a place for her to go. If they really cared about animals I feel that they would do anything to help her find a good home but they didn't. So disappointing.

I absolutely love this salon! Every time I come I feel welcomed and at home. The decor is very modern and there is lots of cool artwork to look at while you wait. Sonia colored and cut my hair. I'm not picky when it comes to color so I allowed her to do whatever she liked to it which turned out amazing! I also wanted to go from long hair to short hair and she knew exactly what I wanted. She did such an amazing job on my hair and I left so happy! No one else will touch my hair but her and I will definitely continue to go to shampoo ink.

We hadn't been to cafe zupas for quite a while and I couldn't figure out why till today. Both my husband and I asked for a large salad which I received but he did not. They rushed us to the front to pay and now I wish we would've stayed to watch them make the salads. Our salads lacked ingredients and flavor and I can't believe we payed $14 for them. The one star is half for customer service (the employees were actually kind) and the other half for the chocolate covered strawberries that came with our salads. Now I remember why we stopped going and will never go again.

After spending all day trying to find a decent eyebrow threading salon I decided to try this one despite some of the reviews.   First of all I couldn't find the actual salon. It's hidden and super small and after realizing I had passed it maybe four times I was annoyed.   I was the only one in the salon and she sat me down right away. Thank god that it was air conditioned well because I was sweaty and hot. I asked the girl to do whatever she thought was best with my eyebrows since I don't know how to do them myself. Usually when someone is shaping your eyebrows it takes quite a few minutes. After maybe two or three total minutes she was done. I thought that maybe she was just super fast but no my eyebrows had no shape to them whatsoever and she barely cleaned them up. Then I realized she was in such a hurry because two other people walked in while she was working on me. I was so frustrated I left without saying anything.   I will never return here and if you're looking for a good eyebrow spot I recommend you look somewhere else.

I've been looking for a good place to get my eyebrows threaded. I had messed them up by attempting to pluck them myself so after growing them out for about a month I decided it was time to get them shaped again. I walked in and only waited a few minutes, everyone was so nice and welcoming. I didn't get the name of the girl who threaded my eyebrows but she did an amazing job and made them look exactly how I wanted them to. The price is amazing for the service you receive and it only took a few minutes for her to reshape and clean up my eyebrows. I'll definitely be going back!
