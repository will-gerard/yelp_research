The Vig sucks!!! The manager at this establishment, Pam, kicked me out because her bad excuse for a waitress, Kate Lynch, was so inappropriate as to tell my friends mean things about me. This was not only inappropriate but unneccessary. She did NOT need to tell my friends anything!  For me to get kicked out as a result of this is absurd!  I would urge everyone to not go to the Vig! It is a BIG mistake to ever go to the Vig, the more people I deter from going there the better! Maybe it's time to break out the markers, make signs and pickett the place so that everyone knows just how unfair it was to kick out a customer because their waitress felt like getting even.

Stingray sushi in the Scottsdale quarter has the worst management imaginable and I would deter anyone from EVER going there! I was a long time repeat customer, so much as going there daily even, and was there again one evening recently. I paid my bill but the girl that I was with did not. She tried to give them a gift card that she had won for playing some poker at El Santo which is owned by the same group and they would not let her use it, only when it was given to her, it was specified that it COULD be used at Stingray. She did not have the extra money and she was unable to pay without the use of this gift card. When I went back alone the next day they said that I couldn't dine there again even though I paid MY bill the day before! How fair is that? I was at their grand opening and practically every day thereafter! Stingray Sushi in the Scottsdale Quarter is the absolute worst sushi place ever just because of the incredibly horrible management. The Chinese guy is immensely a piss poor managerial figure! If anyone is at all thinking of going there for sushi I would beg you to reconsider! Stingray Sushi is a horrible place mainly because of the staff there, but also because their sushi has only gone up in price and the quality of it has gone down. If anyone is thinking of going there I would plead and beg you to go somewhere else. RA in Kierland is across the street and the people there are super nice and the sushi is big and really good! Just say no...to Stingray Sushi in Scottsdale Quarter!!!!!!!!
