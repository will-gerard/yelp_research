Like many of the other users I found Apex Tint via a Groupon. I decided to give it a try because it seemed like a good deal and the reviews were mostly good. It was a little hard to get scheduled at first (I called and left a message, and they would call back while I was at work, no fault on their part) but finally was able to get scheduled for a 10am appointment.   On the day of the appointment I showed up and Ron got right to work explaining all my options. The groupon covered the basic tint in your choice of three different shades. I decided to upgrade to the ceramic tint because it blocks the heat out a lot better. Definitely a must have for any Arizona driver and worth the extra money. Ron told me the car would take about two hours and gave me their wi-fi password so I could use my computer in the lobby. Two hours later my car was all finished and looking great. The tint looks fantastic and the interior of the car is noticeably cooler while driving around. Its also great to know that I have a lifetime warranty on the tint in case anything does go wrong.   If you need tint, I would definitely recommend Apex Tint. They are reasonably priced (even without the groupon) and do fantastic work.

I really wanted to like this place, I really did. I've been 3 times now since the grand opening and have left feeling unimpressed every time. At first I chalked it up to just being a newer restaurant still trying to figure out the kinks however it's been a few months and things don't seem to be improving.
