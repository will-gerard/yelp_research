Aside from the fact that I specifically asked for cheese in my burrito and did not receive it, it was pretty good. The girls working there were super sweet and the service was fast. I got a carne asada burrito and will say that it was tasty. It had a good portion of meat, beans, and rice (except no cheese..arrrgggghhhh HULK SMASSSHHH!!!!!) and the cilantro and onions complimented the burrito.   They could do with a bit less salt on their meat  and perhaps the burritos could be a bit bigger (then again I eat like a 400 pound man so I can't judge small portions.)  I will definitely be returning there again in hopes of getting cheese to go into my burrito. Would recommend this place as a good lunch spot :)

Love this place! The falafel and hummus is delicious here! Be sure to ask for the whole wheat pita, it's healthier and tastes way better. They also used to have an item called a "medchilada" same concept as an enchilada  but way tastier, the portion is pretty large (I eat a lot so when I say it's huge, believe me) so I would suggest sharing it with someone. I always get it with tofu, tried it with meat but it just wasn't the same.   Now although this is no longer on the menu, you can still order it. All you have to do is ask :)

My parents bought me my 2006 Elantra from here back in 07 and I've never experienced such wonderful service. Everyone here is friendly and even if you're just getting something as simple as an oil change, they wash your car and give you a full inspection(and actually go over it with you!). My service rep is Donna and she's always been great, very considerate of my needs and works with my schedule and budget.  One time after getting my alignment fixed it seemed a bit off so I came back the next day and they were able to get me in right away. They fixed it for no charge and the GM went on a car ride with me to double check that i thought everything was up to par.  I'm considering buying a 2011 Sonata and I won't go anywhere but here. I love this dealership and service center.

I start drooling just thinking about this place. The food here is amazing and so is the staff. I moved to San Fran for 6 months and when I came back, they remembered me and I only went there like once a week before.   Let me start off with the burritos: the tortilla is absolutely scrumptious and grilled lightly to perfection, you can tell they actually make it themselves. The meat is so juicy and delicious I can't even begin to describe it. My personal favorite is the shredded beef burrito (i add cheese to it..mmmm). Their breakfast burritos are also insanely good and have good portions of ingredients (it's not all egg).  SALSA!!! Holy hell, their salsa is phenomenal and available for purchase in-store in the fridge on the side in a small or large container sizes. Sometimes, if you mail Santa enough, they sell it at Costco in large containers...those days are glorious. They also have fresh chips that they make every day that are soooo good.  Finally, the pastries...yum yum yum, I''m in love with the cream horns and cherry empanadas. They are always baked to perfection and are so fresh.  I'd recommend this place to anyone, great for breakfast, lunch or dinner since they now have extended hours from 7am to 8pm Tuesday-Saturday. Only downside here is that they aren't open every day :(

I have mixed feelings, my sales guy was awesome, everything that came after was very frustrating, and the service center is great! I bought a used 2011 optima in January 2014, Adam was an amazing sales rep and got me a decent deal on my car. I decided to go with financing first which was set up and approved after I was told that an after market alarm needed to be added to lower the monthly payments (no one made me aware that it was an extra $950.) The  next day, after speaking with my parents, I decided to pay off the car in full instead of paying an extra 10k in interest over time. I went in with a check, cancelled my financing, and asked that the title be sent to me and not the bank.   It took me 4 months to finally convince them to get me a refund on an alarm I didn't need or want to begin with, especially since I didn't have any payments now. Also, I was told I would get my title within two weeks and I barely got it at the end of April, first I was told it must have just got lost in the mail, after more pushing, they told me it was sent to the bank that was going to finance my vehicle, even after I specifically told them not to because I cancelled financing.   Aside from that ridiculous incident, I had a pretty good experience, most of the people there are really nice, and the service center is fast and efficient. It was recently remodeled so now it's very spacious. They have Starbucks coffee, water, and popcorn. If you have the time they will also do a full outside wash for you and while it's not perfect it still made my car look really good.

I'm sure at some point this was a nice hotel but lack of upkeep has driven this place to rock bottom. I guess also my taste is a bit skewed since I frequent the Venetian, but this hotel was free with my company for CES 2011 and I wasn't about to pass that up.  The whole hotel was pretty dirty, I thought at any moment the garage elevator might break or that one day the doors would open and a hobo would be waiting inside with a knife. Also, when I arrived at 10pm, the valet was closed...umm hello..this is Vegas...nothing closes..WHY ARE YOU CLOSED??!!!???  I also took a nap around 2pm and woke up at 6pm with a swollen eye, I blame it either on dirty pillows or one of the cleaning ladies punched me while I was sleeping because they couldn't clean the room...who knows...  I will give them points for having 76 cent water in the gift shops, comfy beds and fast room service (we asked for extra towels to be brought up.) Also, (being a girl) taking a shower and having the mirror fog up is a pain in the ass since we need to get ready afterwards. I don't know what crazy system they had but the middle of the mirror never fogged up and let it be known that I take hot enough showers to where you can't see your hand in front of your face.  Also if you want to gamble in peace, this is the place, practically dead in the casino any time of the day I came to find out.   So not bad enough for one star..not good enough for 3...

Holy christ on a cracker, I've been coming here for 3 years now and am absolutely in LOVE with this place. My favorite is the Avocado Pizza ($14) and I like to add prosciutto ($3) to it for a little extra flavor. It's thin crust, no sauce and made with asiago cheese(yummm) It's a good size to eat by yourself if you want to take some home, or it's perfect to share for two people. They also have great specials on pitchers of sangria and some sort of vodka lemonade from what I remember.   Be sure to check out their grocery area and the gelato shop next door as well. I'd suggest to call ahead and make reservations since it's usually pretty crowded after 5 or 6pm.

Any time I find myself in Vegas I HAVE to come here. The atomic fries pretty much hooked me for life. I can't get enough of this place. Not only are the burgers insanely yummy but so id everything else.   If you don't like spicy things they do also have cheesy fries. If you've read any of my reviews you'll know by now that I LOVE CHEESE! My heart goes out to you lactose intolerant people :(  Anyways, last time I was here was when I was in town for CES2011 and our waitress was super nice. Now I''m not sure if the service was just slower that day or because I was about ready to eat the small child at the next table...could have been both, but I'm going with the latter. I managed to shovel down a burger and a bowl and a half of atomic fries...holy orgasm in my mouth.   After coming here I pretty much always end up coming out looking 10 months pregnant but I will never regret it (thank you fast metabolism!)   Would recommend this as a great lunch or late dinner burger joint..they also serve extra large drink sizes for alcoholic beverages so thats always a plus :)

Worst burritos I've ever had, not only was the service slow but the burrito had small ingredients mixed in that weren't even supposed to be there. I got a California burrito, asked for guacamole, which they did not include and tucked into the fold of the awful tortilla was fried egg...what the hell are these people doing?  The whole thing was a runny mess of beans and almost no other ingredients. The cashier was extremely rude, the meat was sub-par and I'm pretty sure the chips were radioactive.   All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and if you're saying this is the best Mexican place you clearly haven't been anywhere other than Del Taco or some other crap fast food chain.

I don't understand all the hate for this place. Like the guy before me said "clearly the refried beans have gone to your head." There are so many more choices here and the food is flavorful. Plus, how can you not love queso sauce? ARE YOU NOT HUMAN???  I'm a little 110 pound girl but I love big portions so the amount of meat and everything else they heap on there is amazing. Plus they seem to always have quality meat. More than once I have stopped by a Chipotle, the barbacoa tasted and had the texture of meat that had been chewed and then someone decided they didn't want to swallow it and put it back in the meat bucket.   Well I'm not here to rag on Chipotle, but I am here to tell you what a yummy place you're missing out on. I understand everyone has a bad day and maybe one time they had crappy rice or something, but who are you to judge something after one experience? My favorite sushi place has had one bad day, I never judged them on it and you shouldn't either.  I'd recommend this place as a great lunch spot, it's quick and delicious. Don't forget the queso :D

This place is HORRID, I was here for Valentines day 2010, we were seated and ordered drinks...20 minutes went by when the waiter finally came back to our table empty handed saying "oh oops sorry I'll be right back with your drinks"...another 20 minutes go by..comes back with no drinks, he can see that I'm pretty pissed and finally returns 5 minutes later.  Now I don't know how many of you know what a Vodka Collins is but it's a simple drink made with sour mix, sprite(or tonic) and vodka and comes in a tall glass. The waiter came back with a martini glass, filled with the worst pineapple martini I've ever tasted...what the hell? At this point I didn't complain because god knows how long it would have taken him to come back with another drink.  The food was awful, my soup tasted like lukewarm bathwater with fermented fish (don't remember what it was and it has since been removed from the menu..thank god) and the entrée wasn't much better, the lobster was insanely rubbery and I think I could have had more pleasure eating a doggy chew toy.  Only semi-edible thing here was the desert, I had triple layer mouse cake and the cheese cake, those were alright but nothing spectacular.  I love the JW Marriott but this place ruins it.

I've given this place, not two, not three, but FOUR attempts to redeem themselves and yet they continue to fail me. They're a disgrace to the Chipotle family. I usually order in advance and pick up food for myself and several co-workers and these have been my experiences over the span of 7 months:  1st trip: I got 3 soft tacos with barbacoa: the meat was so greasy I managed to fill half a cup with grease.  2nd trip: got a burrito bowl with barbacoa: the meat looked and tasted as if someone had attempted to chew a fatty part of steak and then just put it back in my bowl.  3rd trip: got a burrito bowl with barbacoa, light sour cream, extra cheese and pico: received a bowl with so much sour cream, I couldn't see anything under it. Had about 3 strands of cheese on top.   last attempt, today: got a burrito bowl with barbacoa, light sour cream, extra cheese and pico: meat was dry and chewy, no pico, no sour cream, half a spoon of rice and beans and so much cheese it was almost inedible. (and if you've read my reviews, you know how much I LOVE cheese.)  In conclusion, I don't know how this Chipotle is still in business. It's lacks flavor, attention and effort. Will never return to this Chipotle and discourage others from attempting to eat here.

I came in today because as I was leaving class, I heard a grinding sound accompanied by a bit of vibration in my brake pedal. I called and spoke to Jasen who was able to get me in 10 minutes later. They took my car right away and a tech even came out to ask me some additional questions about what I had experienced and how often my brakes were doing what happened today (very rarely).   I waited about 20 minutes before I was told (for the FIRST TIME IN HUMAN HISTORY at a service repair shop): "we couldn't find anything wrong with your brakes so we aren't going to replace anything because we don't want to charge you for something that doesn't need to be done."   I think hell froze over...what??? You mean I don't need to get 4 new brake pads, tires, a new air filter and an oil change for the lovely price of 1000 dollars like most other places? Do my ears deceive me?  I'm definitely coming back here if I have any problems in the future as they don't seem to want to shake me for every penny and actually care about what I need.

Disclaimer: They may have better drinks and staff by now.  I came here for my bday with my mom in March 2010, the drinks weren't anything to write home about and had little alcohol. They have a pretty good happy hour so I'll give them that. It also smelled weird in there and for a Wednesday at around 3pm there was an unusually large amount of orange, Scottsdale bar skanks who, in my opinion, were having a contest to see who could scream OMG! the loudest.  I'm pretty sure our waiter was drunk as he could barely see straight and was stumbling around. For the quality of this place... it's overpriced, I love Chandler for the fact that it's not pretentious like Scottsdale and this place is trying way too hard.

I usually like buffets because I'm a fat ass and I eat more than Rosie O'Donnell but this place did not tickle my fancy. The food was mediocre and it was a bit too crowded in there. With the combination of blasting A/C and screaming children, I didn't want to stay there long. I tried as much as I could aside from what was against the back wall because my lunch break was close to being over.   The thing that bothered me the most was that they didn't bother to de-shell (if thats what it's called) the shrimp, it still had a full shell and all of it's little legs attached :/  So I doubt I'll be coming back here again, though I won't fail to mention if you do like coming here that they have a neat To-Go offer where you can fill a styrofoam box with a pound of food for 4.97. So I guess that's nice.

After my aesthetician moved away to Indiana, I really didn't know what I was going to do. I had the same person for 6 years and didn't know how I'd adjust to someone new poking and prodding at my face. All hope was lost, but then I found Leslie...  Leslie really put in the effort to get to know me personally and tailored treatments to what I wanted. I'm currently doing microneedling treatments with her and my skin has gone from being riddled with acne scars, to being almost as smooth as a baby's bottom. I can't explain how happy I am with the service and her attention to detail.   Now I've had waxes with my other aesthetician and have always broken out with terrible rashes before, so when I started waxing again I was very hesitant about the outcome. But holy crap! I got both a Brazilian and my eyebrows done and not a single itch or red spot.   I'm convinced that Leslie is a miracle worker and my only regret is not finding her sooner!
