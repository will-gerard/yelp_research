The new, non AMC Prime, reclining seats, are terrible. They are not friendly to bigger people. You will constantly be moving up and down because your leg hits the buttons. Not very pleasant for me or the person next to me who got upset that my chair kept moving for two hours. The prime theater is OK if you don't mind the extra price . I can no longer come to my favorite theater now. I've been a stubs member since day 1 of this theater. I rarely ever use another theater, until now. I can't move at all or I press the buttons. U can't recline. I can't even leave it down.

I am 31 and I have been coming here since I was16. They have never ever did me wrong. Always helped me out. Always honest. Come here if you want an honest and hard working business.

I have not been here in a few years, but, I remember it being a lot more affordable, and a lot better quality.  The biscuits were dry and crunchy with sugar just dumped on them. My sandwich was so watery that I had to eat it with a fork and knife and it did not have very good flavor,  I had to add more BBQ sauce to make it edible. The garlic mashed potatoes were bland, seemed to me they were warmed up in a microwave.  The prices are way to high on a lot of things. I used to love this place but I do not know if I will be back. Also the wait was a little much for it being a very slow evening. 30 plus min from ordering to being taken out to us.

Had a bad experience last time, and though this was better, the food just wasn't up to par with the Lucille's that first opened. My kid's chicken tenders were tiny and cost 8$. My sandwich was OK, it was piled way to thick to pick up and despite being juicy it did not have enough BBQ flavor. The mac n cheese had no flavor of cheese. The biscuits were very crunchy. The red Velvet cake frosting tasted of freezer burn. All in all I just can no longer recommend coming here. :(

They were very professional, got to meet quickly. Knew exactly what they were doing.Karl was very good at his job. You know,  for being a small company who said they didn't know that they were on Yelp and that they usually are locally used for shops etc they came to Tempe pick me up got me home safe and sound. Give them a call

This place is worth the wait and the price. Brisket is the best!! The beans are amazing. 17$ for two meats and two sides. Worth every penny. There was enough to fill me for hours. Get there early. And wait in line! Best Q in AZ
