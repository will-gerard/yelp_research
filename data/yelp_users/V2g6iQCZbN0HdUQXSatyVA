Pretty good.  Pretty good.  I got a lunch combination with the standard stuff (taco, enchilada, and tamale).  I wasn't a fan of the tamale.  It was too dried out.  The taco and enchilada were really good.  It says that everything is made in house.  It's a shame that  I won't be able to return too soon since I'm rarely in the Phoenix area, which may be a good thing in itself.

I came in open minded having seen a few of their vids on YouTube.  I was entertained for maybe 5 minutes of the show.  I can see how the dancing takes a high level of skill, but it's just not executed as well as you'd think it should be.  The storyline is lacking and left me confused.  There's a little bit of audience participation, which was entertaining.  And the humor just wasn't there.  Fart noises aren't funny beyond age 10.

I checked out KoMex the other day.  I got the kim chi fried rice with chicken.  It was saucy and spicy and in a way...comforting.  It was nice to remove myself from the hustle from the Strip and sit down in a nice little hole in the wall restaurant.  I also tried the burrito.  It basically was any other burrito that I would have gotten at a mexican restaurant, but with bulgogi.  I kind of wish there was a sauce to go with it though.  The crew is really nice and attentive.

Beckett's Table could very easily open a location in LA and charge at least 5 to 10 bucks more per entree and the masses would come. The food is very comforting and delicious. The bacon cheese biscuits are to die for.

Theresa did an amazing job. We filled out our forms, she gave us a quick safety talk and we were out in the range. She was helpful in showing us how to hold the weapon, aim, and fire down line. An amazing experience for a boys' outing. Check it out.

I wanted to grab a quick bite before flying back to LA.  Service here could hardly be described as quick here, nor could it be described as accurate.  I never did get my drink order that day; not even a glass of water.
