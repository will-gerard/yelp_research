My food and drink were fine even though order was never successfully processed. I told the man at the register several times I had a dairy allergy, but of course my breakfast came out with melted cheese all over it. When it came out the second time it had no cheese but was the wrong order...I just ate it cause at this point I wanted to get outta there. Meh.

Dr. Bailey is the absolute BEST ENT doctor. When I first came into his office I had a severe case of vocal nodules that clearly needed to be removed. Dr.Bailey made me feel extremely safe and also excited for the surgery and the idea of a fresh start for my voice. As promised the procedure was quick and painless and my voice sounded BRAND NEW. I would highly recommend Dr.Bailey to anyone in need of an ENT doctor. You won't find a better one out there!
