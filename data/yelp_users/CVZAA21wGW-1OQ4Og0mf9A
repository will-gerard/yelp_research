UPDATE - got a message from the owner - turns out he was helping another customer where they didnt have phone reception. These guys are really nice, not often you find that in a locksmith. Next time im a bonehead and lock myself out of something (my house, my vehicle, my facebook account) im calling these guys first.

I couldn't speak more highly of Kevin and his team.  I called Kevin looking for a quote on moving my 8 foot, one piece slate top table that literally is older than I am - twice over (built in the early 70's by hand).  This table is a family heirloom, and is probably the one most important sentimental object in my entire family (I used to play under it when i was a toddler, and God-willing, mine will too), so I was a nervous wreck thinking about having someone move this thing.  Not only was Kevin the only place I found that would move such an old table (and DIFFICULT I might add, since the top alone takes 4 people to move), but he was incredibly accommodating, professional (met my chick at my house since I had to work), and QUICK.  I got home and was blown away. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend you call Kevin for ANY of your pool table (or billiards as the fancy people call them) needs.
