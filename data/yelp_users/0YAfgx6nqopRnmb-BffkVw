I have only been there once, but man! It's one of the best little hole in the wall places in that area! I wouldn't call the food good...I would call it addicting! I can't wait to go back there with my man! If you haven't gone there, you should. At least once. It's an adventure!!! Go!

Have never been disappointed by Four Peaks. It's my favorite brewery!! I went there after work and got their new Lamb Burger. It...was. AMAZING! I love the atmosphere of the place. It's open, but intimate at the same time. It's perfect for both, going out with friends, or an evening to yourself. Whenever you go is a good time to go.

Today, I went in and talk to them about my AC problem. I had no idea what was going on because I couldn't find out what was wrong when I checked under the hood. So I told them what my truck was experiencing, and that I wasn't sure if it was a simple fix or something major. I waited for 20 minutes or so and everything was done! They said a hose had gotten lose and the engine fried the hose! Yikes! So they replaced the hose and everything was fine! I wasn't even charged for it! I asked them twice what it would cost me...and they assured me it was fine and free! I was expecting to pay hundreds of dollars cause I know that some AC repairs cost a lot. And they had completely blown my mind away with it being free!! I'm so going back there next time I need them! Plus the service is awesome. Everyone there is friendly and easy to relate to.

I don't have to write a long review to say that this is the best BBQ I've ever had!!! Even going out of state and trying other BBQ places...Bobby Qs is still #1.

At first when we got here, it was empty...on a Saturday. Granted we got here at 7...but I still expected a crowd of some sort. Especially since it was just south of Mill Ave, in Tempe.   And driving up to the building..it's not much to look at. Just your typical dive bar exterior.   I honestly thought it was going to be a waste of time, especially since the karaoke wasn't even more than two people and NO crowd. But I gave it a chance and we (me and my friends, plus boyfriend) and stayed. And boy am I glad we did!!! I've never had so much fun! I have been a backup dancer for a random stranger....three times,  did the cupid shuffle with half of the bar!!! Plus I'm still sober! Lol! Food is great. Beer is cold. The only thing that happened tonight, was that I found a bug in my water...thankfully it wasn't bad..just a little garden bug. The server was very sorry and sweet. I give 5 stars because everyone feels like family and just wants to have fun.   I'm so coming back. :)  Plus the DJ looks like Gerard Butler and Hugh Jackman :) LADIES!!!!

I can't believe I haven't written a review about this place yet! I absolutely love this place and it totally is overlooked by a lot of people around the area. It's a in a run downed area by the metro mall, so it's not a surprise that people just by pass this place. Hell, I use to! But not anymore.   I go there quite a few times now, or as much as I can. It's a great spot for some live music! Hanging out with friends! Beer! And food! It really is a great little hole in the wall bar. I love this Irish bar. And they're certified to pour the perfect Guinness!

Good small English pub/dive bar. My hubby and I went there out of curiosity, and we had a good time there. Wasn't sure what we were expecting, and it wasn't a disappointment. So that's good news! Fish and chips are really good, and they have a good selection of beer. Most of the beer are irish...which I'm not complaining one bit :)

Well...sitting here with my man and we are NOT impressed. The decor is nice on the inside...but the service is non existent!! The beer selection is awful and their drafts aren't even working! One of the guys behind the bar seemed annoyed at us when we asked about the beer and the selection and did not even   really sound enthusiastic to be working. We are sitting outside and see at least THREE servers. None have come up to its and asked us for anything. Honestly the fastest server was my boyfriend who had to go up to the bar for some ice water!!! Really?!?! C'mon.   Not to mention the parking lot isn't lit up and the front doesn't have a light on the outside. It looked closed and kinda scary. I wouldn't come through that door alone. I'm only here for a friend's birthday. If it weren't for him I would never step foot in this place  Oh...just to add..went to the bathroom. There is someone trying to sell knic knacks! I couldn't find the soap cause there was women's products all over the counter. And this picture on the wall

Good place for Hockey goers! It's located right inside the Ice Den. Burgers are AMAZING! I'm not just saying that cause I work there. However I fell in love with them when I was a customer. The bartenders are cool, and friendly staff.

I love their Honey Vanilla Latte. It has made me put honey in my coffee every morning now. haha.   I used to go there all the time and now, I just seem too busy. But if you are looking for a good place to get coffee that's not Starbucks, go here! I love the urban feel to it and the "hippiness" of it. Cool, laid back place. Don't forget to bring your Macbook. EVERY TIME I have been there, all the customers are on their Apple Computers.

Was a great place to go! Packed to the roof when we went! But service was awesome and the drinks were great! Fun atmosphere, and rowdy crowd when it came to the football game :) The Nachos were awesome too!

Love going there. My friends and I go there all the time for beer and wings. It's really fun to go and hang out and be apart of the atmosphere. It's a sports bar, so it's loud. But that's what a sports bar is! Duh! The servers are always very nice and seems as if they really enjoy their workplace and customers! My friend works there and can back me up on that. :)   Beer is always good! And wings are never a disappointment!

My husband-to-Be and I decide to go try out this Brewery since he's been wanting to go for some time now. It wasn't bad at all! However, this is definitely a Hop lovers paradise! If you love your hops, go here! They have a "CYRious Double IPA" which is the king of kings IPA! Seriously. I took a whiff of it and I thought I was smelling a pine tree!   Unfortunately, we both don't like IPAs. But that doesn't mean we will give them a bad review for not having our type of beer. Great place! Good food! And the atmosphere was open.   My advice. If you love IPAs...bring a your friends too. It's made for huge groups of friends to hang out!

One of the best pizza places in town! They live up to their name of "Giant"!!! Man! One slice is bigger than my face! You gotta try it!   The place is small, but God Damn do they have good pizza!! Go try it now!

I'd give it a one star, however, I think the concept is a cool idea. BUT...it could've been done better.   The "re-grand opening" was a total loss...it was packed...however their system failed them and they were VERY slow at getting drinks out! If you wanted a beer, then great! but a mixed drink...forget that! My friend had to wait almost an HOUR for her drink! Plus, when they gave her the drink, they just walked away...it's like they were giving them out for free! Sheesh.   We were not happy...plus there was barley any room to move about....ehh oh well..not going back....
