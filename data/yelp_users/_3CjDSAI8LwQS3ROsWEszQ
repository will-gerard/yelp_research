Two stars because the food is still good, but anyways I have been to this chipotle many times and it's a 50-50 thing but their customer service is the worst out of any chipotle I've been to in phoenix. I honestly waited 10 minutes from the time the lady started my burrito to the time I checked out. Total b.s. Then the lady who was on the register proceeded to charge me 9.75 for a chicken burrito where most chipotles only charge 7.00 for the same thing and she didn't even apologize or even look at me for making me and 10 other people wait for 10 minutes to be helped. Oh yeah, they were making food for themselves too and putting it in front of the customers food. Great job on employee training. Total joke.

I work at another bike shop and we don't carry Shimano brake pads. Luckily, I was passing right by bicycle ranch and stopped in and they had the pads I needed and they were actually priced really well. Thanks guys!

About a month ago I was hit by an uninsured driver in my scion Tc. I was devastated as I'm a college student and I had every extra penny I ever earned in this car. I built my car from stock by myself into a beautiful street car. When I was hit I really had no hope that my car would ever be the same again, or if it was even fixable. Luckily I am fully insured and so is every after market part on my car. I took my car to Jim Caniga at gerber and with in three weeks I had it back in my position. To my surprise the car looked perfect. He even went the extra mile and fixed a few previous problems the car had before the wreck. Not only that they replicated all the details that I had spent long hours in my garage doing. These guys are truly great! I'm very satisfied and would recommend these class act guys to anyone in need! Jim Caniga sent me picture email updates of the whole process and kept me very informed. Jim himself is a one in a million class act. Thanks guys!

I have to start out by saying the food was ok. I don't like having to write a bad Yelp review nor do I do so very often, but in a case where a place really is that bad I feel like I need to let other people know about my experience. First off, my dad who is a Scottsdale native has been here, after his first (and last) time eating at this establishment I believe his words of wisdom to me were "never fu@king eat here, ever!" I don't get over to Scottsdale much but a special occasion had me in the area, my girlfriend and her family were in the mood for hotdogs and burgers so, I agreed to go even though what my dad had told me was lingering in the back of my mind. I really did go in to it with an open mind, I wanted to give it a chance.... They sat us in a corner booth and basically forgot about us, I had to physically get up after waiting for our waitress for 15 minutes and ask if they could send her to our table, the AC felt like it was off as it was 82 degrees outside and 90 in the building. Finally, we were able to get our order in, waited a good 30 minutes for our food and they brought out 3 of the 5 plates about 5 minutes before the other two plates. There was no silverware or napkins at the table, so yet again, we had to get up and go ask the receptionist for help. To top it all off it was overpriced.   In a nutshell, the service is HORRIBLE, the employees working that night were clueless (except maybe the chef) food is ok but over priced, the beer wasn't even that "cold"   Dad- you were right.

Went in this morning expecting just a regular visit to einstien's but I was surprised at how amazing this one was, everyone working was very friendly. They quickly got my order in and to my surprise they had way more of a coffee selection than any other Einstein's I've ever been to. On top of that they had all their milks full along with the sugar and other things to compliment the coffee. Around the time I finished making my coffee the sandwich I ordered was ready. They knocked It out of the park. Friendly service, great food, and even better coffee. Defiantly the best Einstien's in AZ. Thanks guys!

I went in a few weeks ago to look around and see what these guys had, they had a few hundred dollars of merchandise behind the counter that I needed and was ready to purchase but nobody ever even acknowledged the fact I was walking around the store waiting to be helped. I even walked up to the counter several times hoping to catch the attention of staff but that didn't happen. After about 20 minutes I finally gave up and left. I hate to write a bad review but my visit was disappointing at best. The sad thing is that it's next to my house and I race mountain bikes, so I'm always in need of parts. I guess I will just have to drive somewhere else to buy what I need. I'm sure they are all nice guys that work there but I guess they just aren't willing to help everyone that walks through the door.
