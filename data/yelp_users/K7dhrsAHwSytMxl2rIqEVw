I liked this place a lot. I came in after a game and sat for a while having a few beers waiting for a friend to show up.  I had a really good Reuben sandwich.  The crowd was pretty friendly   Nice kinda upscale restaurant / sports bar.  Not sure how many more times I will be back in Phoenix Az but if I do, I would check this out again.  Really close to the sports arena as well.  Big plus.

Every year around spring training I seem to watch a game on TV where some asshole is sitting in the 80 degree sun drenched outfield grass section with a beer. Its usually raining here at that time.  I curse him up one side and down the other.  I have not even met his mother but she gets a little bit of bad mouthing too.  This spring training, I am that asshole.  (But please don't talk about my mama)    My first introduction is being 5 minutes away out of a 40 min drive and realize i forgot the tickets.  No worries.  I bought them on line and a guy named Brian in the ticket office saved my butt a long drive back to get them.  He reprinted after he asked if I bought them online.  I did and he checked it out and i was good to go.  You saved my trip and my experience to this ball park.  I appreciate you.  The stadium is small in comparison to major league parks and I loved it.  The staff is made up primarily of retired folks and they could not be nicer.  The lines go a little slower because they BS and make jokes.  It's all good.  Loved it.  Except the 70+ year old man that was trying to take a run at my girl.  Back it up old man.  I will push you down.  Its all fun and games until someone breaks a hip.  Food is better than big league parks in LA and beer is way cheaper too.  Everyone seems to really enjoy the Cactus league when it comes to town.  I had a great time and if my girl can promise to behave in the future, I will take her back with me.  Either way, I'm going.

My girlfriend and I wanted to get off the strip and do a little downtown one night of our three day trip so we headed to the 4 Queens.  I paid $23.33 for a Thursday night.  They place is what it is. Its old school and has its share of weirdos but thats Downtown.  We had a great time and the staff was great.  The valet is pretty retarded to be honest.  To get your car, you have to go to three differant people and then they go get your car.  Pretty lame but again, I had a blast there.    We liked walking the Fremont street at night and sucking down $2.00 Corona's.  Its located right smack dap in the middle of Freemont street so getting your car to it was a little confusing at first but we figured it out.  I'd definitly do this place again.

This particular location is in Monte Carlo Hotel Running on only two hours of sleep and looking down the barrel of a full day by the pool drinking beers, somehow this seemed like a good idea.  Girlfriend and I ordered: a ONE menu item plate. (for me) a rice and noodle ONLY plate. (for vegi girlfriend) two waters and two Soda's IT CAME TO.......................... $27.00    Are you people insane?  I get its Vegas but damn, I almost Sh@t myself.  No flavor, and average as the day is long with Restaurant style pricing.  If i was starving to death and found one in the desert,  I keep walking and look for a McDonalds or a soup kitchen or a dead animal  anything but Manchu WOK.    Manchu WOK, enjoy my $27.00, im getting my enjoyment now wrighting about your dump instead of when I ate that mess you serve up.

I was dying to see what the $60.00 burger was all about but not quite enough to get off my wallet and dick in deeper....so I went with your average Joe type of burger. Loved taking my vegetarian girlfriend to a burger bar and ordering it rare. Mine was rare and very very delicious. I had it on Sunday on my way out of town so that means i had completely punished myself by the pool and in the lounges the days earlier. That burger said goodbye in a way i needed. It said "there will be several accidents on the 15 south so this should hold you over for 5+ hours" and it did. Loved it. I had the skinny fries and they didn't do a thing for me, however the onion rings were pretty damn good. Next time I will go for onion rings.   Staff is really helpful and very attentive. We waited a little bit for the burgers but it was Sunday and Check out time. I'm not the only genius that decided to eat before leaving town so I get the wait.  There were a lot of really good waitress's and that was causing some serious issues with the girlfriend because i was actually looking around at what everyone was eating and my girl friend at first thought I was checkin out the servers.  Then when i explained that i was seeing what everyone else was eating she started laughing and said, of course you are...you yelp more than you look at porn on the internet.  NOW THATS FUNNY.

Went to Vegas for a wedding that my girlfriend was maid of honor in.  We skip out a night earlier that we originally planned and stayed at 4 Aces on Fremond on a Thurs for $22.00  Nice  Okay so then we decide to of course drop bags and go wander.  We both worked all day then drove.  Hit a bunch of the $2.00 Corona places and walk around with beers until we decide to go check out the Griffin.  Man am I glad we did.  They have one in LA that I have seen but never been in.  I understand they are simular.  Its dark inside with a nice long bar and cool bartenders.  Drinks are about like any other normal bar and they were fairly good pours.  The seating is pretty chill.  Has a loungy feel to it.  Button red pleather seats and booths.  They had fire places around the place that people could sit and chill by.  They are located in the middle of the room instead of the walls.    Its Vegas  so you have the local crowd that isnt going to go into Casino bars and you also get a few Idaho boys and girls and just about everything in between.    Chill Music, kinda Indie sounding and the volume was at a level that you could hear it but not so loud that you couldnt relax and talk without screaming.  I had a great trip so I may plan another one before summer is up and I am definitly hitting up the Griffin again.

$2.00 Beers, live music, street vendors, lively crowd and a pretty decent light show....this place is very fun for a night. Look I paid 23.00 bucks to stay at the 4 Queens right there.  If you want fancy shmancy, go to THE Hotel or something upscale.  You cant take yourself to serious when you come down here.  Its low cost and therefore you going to be rubbing elbows with the value seekers.   Much more than a night would be a little much.  Its a great party street but I wish it was longer or just had more property.  We walked it for a while and then went to the Griffin for a bit.  It was a great time and look forward to our return.

Spring Training.  So how did i start my Spring Training that fine morning? Enchiladas, taco, Omelet, Rice, beans, Chilli Relleno, some BBQ, a gang of Mimosas and some chocolate cake.  This place is in a strip mall sort of complex.  From the outside you would think its a little rinky dink joint but its fairly good size and nicely set up in there.  Good size bar top and two dinning areas.  The buffet was really good and I will certainly do it again next time I find myself in Surprise, AZ

This place is great.  First time I came in it was hotter than a mutha inside!  We left because it was packed and we spent the day moving in sweltering heat so we left.  AC issues im sure.  We returned on my next trip out to AZ and it was great.  Ill do it again and again.
