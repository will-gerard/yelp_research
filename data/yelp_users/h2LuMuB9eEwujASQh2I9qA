clearly RAWHIDE makes an effort to keep things family friendly -- like $2 water (which i paid $6 the day before at a baseball game). the kids had a blast climbing the rock wall (JULIANA made it nearly to the top), riding the train, the stagecoach and the burros.   WYATT was completely fascinated by the blacksmith and watched him work for over an hour. for me the hi-lite was when the four-year old got arrested (for breaking hearts) and tossed in the RAWHIDE jail. he couldn't stop giggling.   JULIANA panned for gold until her fingers looked like skinny, white prunes.   i think the kids could have spent the entire day in the petting zoo with the pot-bellied pigs, the baby goats, the llama, the sheep and the chickens.  the gunfights were high drama !!  we splurged ($40) on an 8x10 sepia photograph of the TATUM clan as outlaws and saloon girls which we christened the "HOLE-IN-THE-HEAD GANG" ...  three days later and the kids are still wearing their hats and sherriff badges. great family fun on a shoestring budget.

Glad I waited a couple days before finishing this or they would have been lucky to get two stars out of me. I guess it's hard to live up to the "BEST THAI RESTAURANT IN NORTH AMERICA" billing. That creates some pretty unrealistic expectations.   Still ...   The place has a great vibe -- kinda like eating in someone's home. I would suggest that, unlike us, try going when they are not in the middle of their lunch buffet. Even though we ordered off the menu, I think the kitchen struggled to get out of their all-you-can-eat mindset.   The BEEF JERKY ISSAN STYLE (#13A) was an adventure. Nice as a diner to try something this unfamiliar. Had really interesting flavors but before the beef was jerked the silver skin (tough and bitter) was not trimmed properly (or at all) and some of the bites were chewy in an unpleasant way.   The NAM KAO TOD (#14 Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage) was really amazing. If you like that essential Thai taste of lime, powdered-toasted rice and fish sauce, make a point of trying this dish -- it was very good. The only criticism is when they say minced, they're serious. The sour sausage (which looked suspiciously like tiny cubes of chopped up ham steak) was hard to pick out (tastewise) from the other flavors. We ordered it medium and it was plenty spicy (we had two small children with us). This is a dish that I suspect gets better when you dial up the heat -- but even at medium was outstanding.   I ordered the PORK STEW NORTHERN CURRY (#K. from the NORTHERN menu) and it was good. This is a "dry" style curry so if you're looking for lots of gravy to sop up with your rice go another direction. Some of the chunks of pork were fatty and some were a bit parched. I am a sucker for anything braised (I like the mouth feel) but without much liquid everything seemed a little dry. Still, overall, the dish had, as other reviews have mentioned, a nice homey feel.   THAI LIME DRINK was a nice touch on a hot LAS VEGAS afternoon.   However, the YELLOW CURRY (#129 with chicken) was really disappointing. My wife ordered it to share with the kids since it's one of their THAI favorites. In all fairness WYATT, my three-year old, ate more than his share and seemed to enjoy it -- then again he insisted on a McDONALD's happy meal on the drive over from SAN DIEGO. The chicken was grainy. The carrots were really al dente, the potatoes were nearly raw (literally not figuratively) and the yellow-curry and coconut cream base were thin and sadly bland. I think if it sat on a steam table for an hour or two the vegetables would have cooked through and the curry itself would have reduced down and concentrated the flavor.   The single best THAI restaurant in North America ??? I don't think so but still, for the most part, pretty good.

grabbed a full rack of ST LOUIS RIBS and some sides at the carryout window. they were fall-off-the-bone tender -- i like my ribs a bit more toothsome but BOBBY Q's delivers on the whole tender promise. nice smokey flavor and both sauces were tangy and full flavored without being too sweet.  the sides were tasty. the potato salad was nearly as good as mine (which is very good) and the mac-n-cheese was creamy and rich.  the ladies at the counter were as nice as can be. next time i'm in the PHOENIX area, i'm gonna make a point of having a sit down experience at BOBBY Q's.   maybe i'll even try the brisket and pulled pork ...

beautiful food with great eye-appeal and amazing flavors.   we started with the involtini -- thinly sliced prosciutto wrapped around baby arugula and goat cheese, drizzled with olive oil and aged balsamic then finished with shaved parmigiano-reggiano. gorgeous dish -- the peppery greens and creamy tang of the cheese were perfect foils for the rich, salty pork. well conceived, well executed and well received.   if you still have lingering doubts that quality ingredients carefully sourced make a huge difference, close your eyes and just smell your pizza (ours was the SETTEBELLO -- crushed tomatoes, fennel sausage, pancetta, roasted mushrooms, pine nuts, basil, mozzarella. the aroma from the toppings was pure pleasure.   here's the criticism -- not exactly love at first bite. i had some very serious problems with the texture.   their pizza's really soggy especially in the center. now, i understand that's a personal preference but pizza you can eat with a spoon's kind of a turn off for me. i'm sure the style is terribly traditional (and SETTEBELLO makes an awfully big deal about the authenticity of their pizza) but the wet, spongy crust was just tough to get passed.   ours was a little undercooked and the fact that we were the first customers of the day and that the oven probably hadn't come up to temperature didn't help. as much as i enjoyed the flavors, their pizza felt like wet cardboard in my mouth. still i gave them four stars -- yeah, it was that good.

great place to take the family and catch a little spring training baseball. watching my PADRES wallop the CUBS 14 - 4 was a very pleasant way to spend a saturday afternoon. JULIANA and WYATT made it all the way thru the 7th inning stretch -- though a steady stream of hot dogs, sodas, snow cones and ice cream probably helped.  had great fun watching my kids sing "TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALLGAME" -- transported me back to seeing games with my dad when i was a kid ...  i wish PETCO PARK had as many interesting places to eat. sure seems like if you're gonna shell out $6 for a bottle of water you ought to be washing down something more tasty than the corporate factory food offerings there are in SAN DIEGO.

took LEANNE S's advice and decided not to wait 4 hours (literally, we showed a little after 5 pm and the hostess told us not before 9 pm) at the PHOENIX pizza hot spot. turns out she was right -- this place definitely satisfied.  PATSY GRIMALDI's is very old school. the FRANK SINATRA photos behind the hostess desk and OLD BLUE-EYES crooning on the sound system were a dead giveaway ...  their coal-fired oven produces an excellent crust, from a technical perspective probably the best i've ever eaten -- thin, crispy and perfectly cooked.  the sauce ("raw" style alert in case you're overly partial to the long, slow simmered variety) goes on top. this is not a style for fans of bloated, soggy (super-sized) pizza piled high with toppings and big, greasy blobs of cheese.  two personal pizzas fed four with some left over. service was attentive. if you're a pizza minimalist (like me), i haven't found anybody that does it better.

Out of the way place -- En Sushi was a drive (and we were already staying in Henderson) but well worth it.   Went on a Saturday afternoon. Place was empty and WYATT, my three-year old, stretched out on the padded bench and promptly fell asleep (so the rest of us had an unhurried, two hour late lunch -- a nice plus). The atmosphere was casual, the decor seductive and the service relaxed, personal and attentive.   The premium sake we had paired well with everything we ordered and our little ice carafe was well attended (frequently refilled) by our server.   The miso, one of the usual Japanese restaurant choices of JULIANA (my five-year old) had lots of the housemade tofu and was her all time favorite. Sadly her shrimp tempura was a bit undercooked and the oil wasn't quite hot enough (so the batter was a little greasy).   From the robata we did not specify how we wanted them cooked and the kobe (nothing special) and the duck breast (the basalmic made it) were both medium well and not the medium rare I would have preferred. (And i, a notorious tough reviewer, still gave the place four stars -- yeah, it was that good.) The beef tongue (which we had after the foie gras) was good but (in the same teriyaki sauce as the foie) not particularly distinctive. The corn-potato was just, plain fun.   The foie gras was OMG.   We (it was a party of four) had three cut rolls (Sexy Girl, Candy Cane and one whose name I can't recall), a salmon-skin hand roll plus white-tuna (yes, I know it's not really tuna) and uni sashimi. Sauces were more subtle and complex than the usual chili-mayo and sweet soy concoctions you get at the typical American sushi joint.   i know the review seems overly critical but to tell you the truth i was really wowed. Really a good dining experience.

the guy that invented those slushy machines may not actually be the spawn of SATAN but i'm pretty sure they're close personal friends. still, i have to confess i enjoy watching frat boys stumble down the STRIP (or passed out in the gutter) clutching those yard long long plastic glasses of nearly frozen, neon-colored concoctions.   i had the pina colada. couple sips in, overwhelmed by the sweetness, i found myself wondering if there was any alcohol in the mix. but i hadn't had breakfast (even though i got up early) and by the time we sat down it was early afternoon and my tummy was empty. like a ninja assassin, silent but deadly, that bad boy got the best of me. it wasn't till we got up to leave that i realized i couldn't feel my feet.   our server whose name has been changed to protect the innocent (that would be BARRY since truth be told he's guilty as hell) called the daughter "PRINCESS POOPY PANTS" and the boy "STINKY." couldn't seem to make up his mind so alternated between "COUGAR" and "GRANDMA" for the wife unit. he was relentless in the DON RICKLES bit and we all laughed till our sides ached.  but everything we ate was freezer to fryer and generally nasty. all things considered pretty much the worst food ever but the floor show was worth a star.

my bar for hotels is not set all that high. if there's a pool and jacuzzi for the kids, if the room's fairly large and reasonably tidy with clean towels and fresh sheets, if the roof doesn't leak and most of the light bulbs light, if there's plenty of hot water and decent pressure in the shower and the TV gets ESPN -- i'm good to stay.   comfortable pillows (if we're driving we usually remember to bring our own) and WI-FI are always nice pluses. this place pretty much had all that covered but here's the rub ...   i'm gonna break cherry here -- in one-hundred and nine YELP reviews, i don't think i've said one bad thing about a wait staff. i worked long enough in restaurants (and have read enough reviews) to believe that harsh words about servers almost always say less about the subject than the writer. however, my experience at the COMFORT INN was so extreme it's worth mentioning.   the hostess at continental breakfast (which was pretty plush -- hard boiled eggs, a toaster with english muffins and bread, a waffle iron, apples and oranges, cereal, juice, milk and coffee) was nasty on a scale i have never experienced in my life. she had an eastern european accent (RUSSIAN, i would guess) and an awful attitude. she got in three separate screaming matches with guests while we were eating.   later, in the pool i overheard other guests in equal amounts of hurt, anger and bewilderment (and a bit of wry amusement) talking about her. the next morning (we stayed two nights) i overheard two other groups of guests (our angry hostess was only there on sunday) reliving their unhappy experiences with her.   when management reviewed her resume and saw she'd been the social director at some notoriously harsh GULAG, they probably should have realized she might not be a great fit in the hospitality industry.   i know ARIZONA's supposed to have a tough immigration policy. well, i'm here to tell you they let one really hateful BITCH slipped through ...

i'm never gonna get my head around my fellow AMERICAN's obsession with STARBUCKS. i have friends that are late every month on their VISA and MASTERCARD accounts (which are probably mostly STARBUCKS charges anyway) because they have a forty-plus-dollar a week coffee habit.  still, when you're on the road, it's nice to have a place where you can drop by and jolt the senses into a heightened state of alertness and use their WI-FI to get caught up on your e-mail.

i grew up in HAWAII and a trip to POKE EXPRESS was a very special treat.  we stopped by and loaded up on lots of tasty nibbles -- SHOYU AHI POKE, SPICY AHI POKE, MUSSEL POKE (KIMCHEE style), SALMON POKE with special sauce and TAKO POKE (KIMCHEE style). still one of my all time favorites, PIPIKAULA, a teriyaki flavored HAWAIIAN-style beef flank steak jerky.  hauled everything back to the "resort casino" where we're staying and filled the mini-fridge.   happy, happy, happy.   life is very, very good indeed !!!

stranded again at SKY HARBOR -- gotta love US AIRWAYS ...  what a nice surprise MODERN BURGER turned out to be. if you can get beyond lunch costing as much as a new car (hey, in an airport you're a captive audience) the food and service were both good. the fries were tasty and the burgers close to IN-AND-OUT and that's high praise indeed.    so, if you fly US AIRWAYS and get stuck in PHOENIX (and if you fly US AIRWAYS you're gonna get stuck somewhere) and you're up for burgers and fries, check out MODERN BURGER.

isn't there only one "L" in tequila ?????  i usually make a point of avoiding airport food but astoundingly poor service from US AIRWAYS and we found ourselves stranded at SKY HARBOR long enough we couldn't avoid getting something in our tummies without risking the kids having a feed-me-now meltdown at thirty-eight thousand feet.  walked by the nearly full seating area at BLANCO TACOS and TEQUILA and most of the plates looked enticing enough to give the place a try.  ordered the SHORT RIB QUESADILLA and CHIPS and GUACAMOLE. the quesadilla was pretty much a greasy mess. the short ribs were grossly under seasoned and moist enough that the tortilla required a spoon and pile of napkins to eat and not in a good way.    the CHIPS were pretty standard like something from the snack aisle at the local mega-mart but the guacamole was actually pretty good.  i was trying to accommodate the kid's appetites and suspect the food would have been better with a different menu choices. i guess if you go to a place called TACOS and TEQUILLA and have neither you gotta assume some of the responsibility for a less than stellar experience ...

the OLIVE & IVY in the PHOENIX airport has a well-trained, well-managed staff. everybody was courteous, efficient and did an exceptionally fine job taking caring of us. not something that happens every time or even very often when you're flying between here and there.   we arrived hungry -- it was a long flight from MINNEAPOLIS and, since we made the mistake of flying US AIR, we ran late (which seems to happen every time we fly US AIR between here and there) and didn't even get a bag of peanuts.  the MEDITERRANEAN PIZZA had a super-thick, doughy crust and was not particularly good but JULIANA, the nine-year old, made short work of it anyway.  JODI, the wife-unit, had the ITALIAN PANINI and the seven-year old a ROAST BEEF PANINI -- both were pretty darn good. especially liked the dense, crusty, chewy bread. WYATT even said he liked the tomatoes on his sandwich -- one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. as a parent, you take the little victories where you find them ...  i had the MEDITERRANEAN SALAD (pre-made to grab-n-go but still fresh) with grilled chicken, almonds, feta, tomatoes, couscous, greens and oregano vinaigrette. nice respite from the meat and starch options i often settle for when we travel.   cost about the same as a flight to LAS VEGAS but when you're hungry and stuck in an airport, what are you gonna do ??  at least the food was good.
