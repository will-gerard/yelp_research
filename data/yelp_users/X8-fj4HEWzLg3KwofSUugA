It's been quite some time since I've been here given the fact I no longer live down the street from this joint.  I've been coming here even before it was Vaqueros so I know they've been doing something right to stick around this long.  The old days of Vaqueros featured cheaper eats with monster size portions.  So when pulling up and seeing that the prices have gone up a bit I was disappointed only to wonder if their portion size went in the opposite direction like most Mexican fast food joints (I.E filibertos).  I ordered the usual of Super Nachos and a California Burro.  I brought it home to my dad and daughter.  I opened the bag up and what do you know, a big monster burro sat there along with a tray of Super Nachos packed to the top! I was once again reminded why I come here when in need for a good Mexican fix! Yes, the prices have gone up but what hasn't these days.  I will say this, if you are the owner of this joint I highly recommend doing some remodeling of the property.  This place looks even worse than before and I can see many potential customers deciding not to pull in based on looks.  Clean this place up and your business will thrive even more. Otherwise, eat up people! It's worth the price of admission! 5 stars for food, -1 for appearance.

Air went out at my house which is an emergency in Phx even in September. I couldn't get any of the bigger places to come out until Monday. Being it was Wednesday, that was not acceptable.  I happen to notice Bumble Bee and the great reviews they have.  Gave them a "buzz" and within a few hours they were able to get a tech over to look at it.  The lady who set up my appt was very polite and helpful.  The tech who came was Bronson.  Very polite young man who not only fixed my issue but he showed me exactly what it was and how small the problem was. He could of easily tried to take me to the cleaners like others do. He was honest and had great communication skills. Not everyday you find that with guys showing up to your home to fix things.  I believe this is a smaller family owned business which is always better in my opinion.  Next time my air goes out they will be the first people to call. Thanks a lot for your excellent service.

Chili was from a can, and came with no onions or cheese, first time that's happened.  The tenders 99. cents were terrible as well. The chicken was chewy and rough. The burger was over cooked and the bread was stale.  Only thing solid was the dr.pepper and sweet potato fries.  I wanted to like it but I couldn't find anything to like. Will not be back for round 2.  This is strictly a hang out n beer type a place, nothing more.

Came here with my 3 yr old on a groupon. Didn't know what to expect but for a discounted $3 coupon I got $15 worth so def worth it.  The fried rice was excellent along with my other dish i ordered.  The Thai tea was very good as well. The dessert we ordered was fried banana and ice cream.  Excellent all around. Don't let the shady strip mall scare you away.  Good and not so pricey.  Will come back soon!

Worst doctor I've ever seen in my life.  This guy treats you like a baby and tells you how you are supposed to feel.  So arrogant and ice cold with you.  Discharged me without telling me only to come to find out from the commission I had no longer had any care available.  (Work related injury) I seen him in the spring of 2014. I tried to change docs before hand but was discharged.  He literally argues with you and raises his voice. I'm not making this up go see for yourself if you don't believe me.   As you can see from other reviews I'm not the only one.  I've re injured my back again so I'm definitely taking a different route this time.   TOCA is definitively a good place but for when it comes to backs, this guy is terrible.  STAY AWAY!!!
