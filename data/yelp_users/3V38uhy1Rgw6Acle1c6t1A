I met some friends here for lunch.  I thought the lunch specials were varied and reasonably priced.  I had a lunch special--the Sakana Lunch which was a tuna roll (with about 8 good size pieces) seven pieces of sushi, miso soup and salad.  Needless to say, I didn't finish the tuna roll.  My friends ordered off of the menu, and their food looked good.  I rated this four stars for these two reasons: #1--from the outside, the place looks a little scary.  It's in a strip mall, and the windows are dark, and there's a neon side that says "open".  Once inside, however, there were lots of customers, a welcoming staff and an open table or two to choose from. #2--the other reason for four stars was we asked for separate checks.  I paid cash--the other two paid with credit/debit cards.  It took forever for the waitress to come back with their cards and my change.  Evidently, what she had done was charge my food to my friend's card.  Then she had to figure out how to credit the card back.   In my opinion, an error like this is inexcusable.    If you check in on Yelp, you get free edamame.  Be sure to show the check in to the waitress.

My friend and I went here for dinner not realizing it was also happy hour.  We decided on the happy hour menu.  I always forget when it's happy hour, and I order a roll, the roll is more rice than usual and smaller portions of fish--the same held true here.  But that was my fault.  The rainbow roll was $8.99, so why not spend a little more and get the non-happy hour rainbow roll with less rice and bigger pieces of fish?  Next time I will.  All in all, the sushi was good as was the tuna tataki (also at the happy hour price).  That was a meal in itself!  I had ordered seaweed salad, but cancelled that when I saw the tuna tataki.  So much food!  Service was excellent--we had Nikki and she acted like she really wanted to be there and that she loved working there.  How refreshing!  I also completed their web survey, so we have a $10 credit when we go back (good for 30 days from our visit).  Love it!

My cousin who lives in Tucson and I met here for lunch today.  (I live in Phoenix.).  If you go here, it's 8 miles off of the freeway, so keep driving until you've gone 8 miles.  I had the salmon salad that had grilled asparagus and shoe string fried potatoes on top.   My salad was good, but the shoe string potatoes were cold which leads me to believe the salad had been sitting (possibly waiting for my cousin's lunch to be cooked).  My cousin had the salmon sandwich which she said was really good. It was served on a hamburger bun with French fries as a side.  She said there was too much bread, so I wonder if it's always served on a hamburger bun or maybe they ran out of the bread it's usually served on.  The restaurant is really cute.  I don't know the history, but it looks like maybe it was a house at one time as there are many small rooms with dining tables in them.  It's very cozy.  The grounds are beautiful with many different cacti and succulents.  I would definitely go back.  The menu is so varied--I would like to try something else.

Lunch menu is great!!!  Went with a meetup group a couple of weeks ago, and we all ordered off of the lunch menu which is served on weekdays only.  The price is $8.99 which can't be beat.  I ordered the Sampler which consisted of a combination of any three items.  My three items were:  Kye Sega Wat (spicy beef stew), Goman (collard greens), and Azifah (whole brown lentils with spices and seasonings).  Everything I ordered was very tasty!  Someone said their Injera wasn't the best around, and I have to agree.  You can get rice instead, but Ethiopian food with rice?  I don't think so.  I had the Injera but, again, not the best I've had.  The other thing I really liked was the menu is very simple--not a lot of food items to choose from.  Other Ethiopian restaurants I've been to have so much to choose from that it makes it difficult to figure out what to eat.  So I like the menu here a lot better because it's easy to figure out what to eat.  Can't wait to go back!

This restaurant is a dive Chinese and Mexican restaurant. When you go inside you place your order at the counter and they bring it to you.  The person will give you samples of some of the Chinese dishes.  I wasn't particularly impressed, but the friend I went with loved her food.  She got two Chinese dishes (with rice and refried beans).  I got a tostada which is only offered on Saturdays and Sundays.  It was small, but the lady told me it would be small.  I also got a quesadilla which was a flour tortilla folded in half with melted cheese, lettuce and tomato inside.  Since it was folded in half, it was cut into two pie shaped pieces.  It was OK, but the lettuce made it soggy.  I chose not to get beans or rice.  It's very casual--food is served in an aluminum container with plastic knives and forks.  If you want to take your leftovers home, they have the cardboard that serves as a cover.  This isn't a place I would go back to.  It WAS, however, featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and there's a picture of Guy as soon as you walk into the restaurant.

Very disappointed in this Phoenix restaurant.  I am visiting and my friend suggested we eat there.  While the menu is nicely priced, sandwiches make up half of the first page.  In small print it states they are not available after 3 or 4.  Why take up over a fourth of the menu with something that's not available for dinner?  We were there at 6:30, so no sandwich for me.  The "specials" which are actually the dinner entrees are listed on a small blackboard on the wall with no prices. I asked about the salmon, and our waiter said "$23".  OK...that's more than I want to spend, but there really is NOTHING else that looks appealing to me.  (About 1/2 of the menu is pasta, and I don't eat pasta.). So I order the salmon--sauce on the side.  The salmon comes--HUGE piece--enough for three meals probably.  It is swimming in the sauce.  I asked the waiter for another plate and said "I meant 'on the side' for the sauce....not on the plate with salmon on top of it."  So he brings me another plate.  I eat part of the salmon (which was cooked perfectly, I will add).  Then the bill comes--salmon is $24.95.  I said to waiter Travis "you told me $23".  His response was "I was wrong....I'll fix it on your bill."  I said "forget it."   When he brought the change, waiter Travis said "next time I'll get it right."  I said "there won't be a next time...I don't live here....and I won't be back."  Not a good experience as I don't pay $25 for a meal ever--it was way out of my budget.

My friend and I went here for dinner last week.  I was surprised she selected this place as neither of us drink, and it's definitely a sports bar.  She said it's a neighborhood hangout, and we both live in the neighborhood, so there ya go!  That being said, the food is bar food and nothing more....so don't go with high expectations about the food.  People go there to drink and watch sports on the many TVs located through out the restaurant/bar.  They DO serve salads though, so I ordered the taco salad with the grilled chicken.  I always bring my own salad dressing, so I took that and everything worked out fine.  The waiter was nice and very accommodating.  I probably won't go back just because I'm not a sports-bar kind of person....but if you are, this is a good place to go.

Trader Joes is Trader Joes unless you encounter one where the employees are rude...then it is no longer the Trader Joes I know.  I moved to Ahwatukee two months ago and was so excited to learn TJs was a mile from my apartment.    On my first trip I met Kristen (who is the only redeeming employee there).  After waiting in line to pay for my groceries, the cashier didn't even acknowledge me.  I questioned the price of an item and he acted like I had offended him by asking.  After paying he didn't say thanks or F U or anything.  Next visit I found a different cashier.  The items weren't showing up on the screen as he scanned them.  I asked him about that, and he said: "oh my register needs to be rebooted."  Really?  He couldn't have done that in between customers?  Yesterday I was there and a cashier was talking to another employee who was eating an apple.  I asked him if his line was open and he said:  "yes, as soon as I'm done with this conversation."  So I got into another line and waited and waited.  He finally finished his conversation and yelled over to me:  "you can come in my line if you want to."   I found the store manager and told him his staff was rude and that shopping there was unpleasant.  I said other TJs I had been in had happy/friendly staff, but this store did not.  His comment?  "I'm sorry you feel that way."  I told him it would be worth a longer drive to find more pleasant staff and I got the same reply.  I'm pretty done with the Ahwatukee Trader Joes.

Decided to switch over to T-Mobile after four years with Virgin Mobile.  Kristen and Jamal sold me a phone and plan that was affordable and had unlimited talk, text and data.  That was the good news.  Imagine my surprise when I got the bill, and it was $10 more than what Kristen promised.  I tried to call the store today and kept getting a busy signal.  Finally I called the T-Mobile customer service number and got a very nice English speaking woman who reviewed my bill and told me that the extra $10 was for insurance on my new phone!  WHAT????  I never ordered that!  And I do believe adding something like without the customer's knowledges is probably against some consumer protection law.     The nice lady removed the insurance and adjusted my bill accordingly.  And I DID tell her where I purchased the phone and gave her Kristen and Jamal's names which she said she had noted.  Won't return to that store ever.

Went here last night for the first time.  It's a fun, family-friendly place.  I was with a Meetup group, and we sat outside.  I had the bbq chicken salad with no dressing.  (I bring my own that I make at home.). The person who took my order asked if I wanted the bbq sauce on the chicken, and I said "no, on the side please."   The salad was excellent!  The chicken was grilled perfectly and not slathered in a bunch of butter or oil.  The burgers looked so good as did the huge onion rings.  And one lady got a milkshake.  She said it was wonderful!  We all enjoyed our meals and the ambience and plan on returning.  It's also a place I'd take out-of-town company because it's just a cool place!

I love the Claim Jumper!  I used to go to the one in Rancho Cucamonga, CA a lot, so the memories are probably one of the reasons I love CJs.  I've been to this location twice--once for dinner and the second time for happy hour.  When we went for dinner a few months ago I ordered the steak salad.  It was good and up to Claim Jumper standards.  This last visit my friend and I went for happy hour (which lasts until they close at 9:30!).  The happy hour menu items are "small plates" at various prices.  I had the street tacos and the Caesar salad--both very good.  My friend had the sliders and the fried zucchini sticks.  She liked both.  The thing about CUs is the food is consistent.  That's important to me.  Caution:  servings are HUGE, so come starving or be prepared to take 3/4ths of your meal home!

I was so happy to see a King's Fish House in Tempe during my recent visit to the area.  I have been to the one in Long Beach and Rancho Cucamonga and love their food!  I ordered the three oyster shooters first. They came with grated horseradish on top--it is NOT cheese!  So I stirred that into the shooter and shot it. Oh so good!!!  For my entree I ordered the Wild Jumbo Shrimp and Lump Crab Meat Salad.  The shrimp and crab were really good, but I was surprised to see chunks of carrots and celery--the celery appearing to be the dry ends of the stalk which I gently removed.  How weird to have big pieces of carrots and celery on what I considered to be a shrimp and crab Louie.  It was good, but I (obviously) was a little too hung up with these other two items to really enjoy it.  Service was nothing outstanding which is typical by today's standard.  I'll go back, but I'll tell them to leave the celery and carrots off.

My friend and I ate at the sushi bar since there was no wait.  Once we were seated, they brought us an ample serving of complementary edamame.    I ordered the cucumber salad (which needed more ponzu sauce or something just a tad sweeter--too much sesame oil), the sweet shrimp, and the sunkissed roll.  My sushi was excellent.  Service was good, but don't except a verbal exchange with the sushi chefs--they are all business.  Would definitely go back!

My friend and I went here Friday night for dinner.  It's one of her favorite restaurants, and I had never been before.  We sat outside, and had no trouble getting a table.    I ordered the Korean Salmon which came sizzling with asparagus underneath it.  The salmon was cooked perfectly!!!  I was so impressed!  And, it was delicious!  I asked for brown rice with it, which I would recommend doing.  It was a great evening with a great meal!

Loved this place!  We sat outside where there was a live band.  We got there at 11 which is the time that breakfast is no longer served.  It takes them 25 minutes to switch over from breakfast to lunch so be prepared to wait a while if you order lunch at 11.  I had a chopped salad which was romaine and iceberg lettuce with a few slices of salami and cheese....not much protein for the price--$9.95.  Others got sandwiches which came with chips.  They said they liked them. One gal got the grilled cheese sandwich which looked awesome!  Inside one can taste olives, tapanades, olive oils and vinegars.  They also have recipes on using the different olive oils and vinegars.  It was an enjoyable way to spend part of a Saturday.

Happy Hour is THE BEST!  I went here with a meetup group this week.  We were seated in the restaurant because there were 20 of us.  They told us, however, that they would honor the Happy Hour prices until 6 pm which they did.  Those that ordered from the HH menu got huge meals at very reasonable prices.  I saw street tacos (3 tacos per plate) with rice and refried beans and another order of a HUGE nacho platter.  Margaritas and sangria were ordered by several ladies--again at the HH price.  I ordered off of the menu and got a Machaca Tostada with pinto beans and guacamole.  I took half of it home because it was so big.  It was also delicious.  The service was great--we had one waitress for 20 of us.  She was patient and handled us with efficiency.  I was impressed!  Will definitely go back.

I LOVED my pizza here!!!  It had a thin crust, the right amount of sauce and cheese AND I got to tell them what I wanted on it and they didn't skimp at all!  I had Canadian bacon, purple onions, olives and tomatoes on my pizza.  There were so many other toppings to choose from, but those are my favorite.  And it's so inexpensive!  They also have salads--a small size and a large size.  Again, pick your lettuce, pick your toppings and dressing.  Next time I'll try a small salad with my pizza--that way I'll have more pizza left over.  Speaking of leftovers, I had my pizza for breakfast; and I must say, it's almost better heated up the next day.  Can't wait to go back!  I almost forgot!--If you check in on Yelp while you're here, you get a FREE Fired Pookie!

Went here for lunch today with a meetup group.  Everyone loved their meals.  Several had the lobster salad croissant (sandwich).  Some had the lamb sandwich which looked delicious!  I had the Blackened Salmon BLT which was also very good.  Service was a little slow, but maybe it was the size of the group or because French cuisine is supposed to be enjoyed.  The restaurant was very quaint and homey.  Loved the ladies restroom--be sure to check it out!  It's a bit pricey, so would only return for lunch.

Sir Veza's has great happy hour prices with drinks and appetizers very affordable!  I, however, ordered a dinner of two tacos with charro beans instead of refried.  My friends who ordered off of the HH menu all got the bbq pork sliders which came with two sliders and fries--$5!!!  I, who ordered off of the regular menu, was able to choose from about 8-10 different fillers for my tacos.  I chose the shredded chicken and the carne asada which is a dollar more.  The shredded chicken was really good, but I wouldn't recommend the carne asada--too dry and small chunks of steak.  (Maybe I'm not a carne asada fan.)  They let me get more beans because I don't eat white rice.  I also liked that I could get charro beans (but not the kind I'm used to) instead of refried beans.  It's a fun place and attracts a young crowd.

Went here the other night with about eight other women.  They crammed us into a booth and added a table.  It was tight.  Everyone ordered something different so it was fun to see what the food is all about here.    We started with fried dill pickles which were excellent!!!  They were nice and hot (temperature) and tasted great with the Ranch dressing.  I ordered the 6 oz. filet with two sides--baked potato and salad.  The salad came with lots of cut up hard boiled egg.  I really dislike hard boiled eggs, so there I was taking off all of the egg I could take off.  My error because the waitress asked if I wanted everything on it, and I said yes not realizing there was egg on it.  My steak was cooked perfectly.  The other meals (I'm so glad I didn't order!) were:  beef tips (smothered in gravy--ugh!), beef kabobs (chunks of meat looked really small), sirloin steak (too thin for my liking) and grilled chicken with bbq sauce (chicken looked dry).    Service was excellent.  And the waitress didn't add the tip in for the large group which is a good thing (in my opinion) because I always tip 20% or more which I did that night.

This place is very cool!  Love the outdoor atmosphere altho' I was there on the last day of June and couldn't enjoy the outside.  Inside is very stark (but in a good way).  The one negative I noticed immediately was the noise level which is LOUD!!!  Sitting at the table it was almost impossible to hear others even though we were practically shouting at each other in an attempt to be heard.  So the food....I ordered the Japanese Fish and Chips.  The only thing Japanese about this dish is the fish is breaded with panko bread crumbs and fried for a long time--hence, it was extremely dry.  The "chips" were regular French fries.  There was a small cucumber salad that was Asian of sorts, but I noticed that others had the same salad on their plates even tho they hadn't ordered the "Japanese" Fish and Chips.  So I can't say that the salad even made it more Japanese.  I wouldn't order this dish again, but would try something else.  Other's meals looked good--meatballs, beef brisket sandwich, salads and more.   One lady ordered the falafel sandwich which was HUGE!  She only ate about a fourth of it.  It did not, in my opinion, look very good, but I'm not a fan of falafel either.  When the weather cools off, I would love to go back and sit outside and have a nice glass of iced coffee or tea.  I plan on doing just that!

I happened on this restaurant today when I was apartment hunting.  I had had the same type of meal at LA Crawfish in Tomball, TX.   The Angry Crab, however, had a larger selection of fish and seafood as well as sauces and intensity of heat.   I had the shrimp with a potato and small ear of corn.  I got the Trifecta Sauce and the medium heat.  It was SO good!   The medium heat was pretty spicy, but once I got used to it, I loved it.  If you are looking for your typical Louisiana crawfish or shrimp boil, this is not the place.  Their shellfish comes in a plastic bag with the sauce you pick.  You don't need to dip it in a remoulade sauce or cocktail sauce.  It comes "swimming" in the sauce you select.  They have raw oysters, poor boys, gumbo and more.  The atmosphere is very relaxed.  You can't go wrong here!
