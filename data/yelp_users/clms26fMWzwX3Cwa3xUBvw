I took my mom here and after about 15 minutes she's like ... This is it? I had to gently remind her with "mom, this is a desert." We had a good laugh once I gently set the expectations to a more realistic level. Still had a great time. Go here if you're running out of things to see or they have some kind of art exhibit going on.

Called Foto Forum and a sale-man answered the phone quickly, which was a plus, unfortunately, that's where the customer service ended. I asked if they purchase used camera equipment and he quickly responded with "No, no one does anymore. Try Craigs List or just give it away." Maybe I'm just overly sensitive but he had an almost condescending tone as if I asked a stupid question.   Guess when he says no one buys used equipment, he's not referring to Adorama, B&H Photo,  or Tempe Camera etc.  Tempe Camera isn't really into the market of buying used equipment, but the Sales man was at least willing to help to see if we could make a deal. Now that's awesome customer service.

Good: Food was amazing. Atmosphere is awesome. All the different plates introduce you to a new way of experiencing  flavor combinations.   Bad: A little pricy, but thats what you can expect from a  cool hip place. Don't go there to get full unless you want to break the bank. Mandatory parking sucks, because my truck is usually dirty, inside and out. I'm taking a star off myself for that.   Conclusion: The bad isn't really bad, I'm just cheap. Someday when I'm rich and famous, I'll look at the check, laugh, and throw hundred dollar bills at the table and be like "Shut up and take my money!"

Don't expect much from this place. Place is dingy, especially for it being in Scottsdale. The service was okay, but the sushi rolls were sub par. There was even one roll, the group couldn't even finish because the fish tasted old.   We won't be back.

Good: Food was tasty. Service was tasty. (How is tasty service even possible?) Place was a great place to hang out due to very comfortable lounging and seating arrangements.
