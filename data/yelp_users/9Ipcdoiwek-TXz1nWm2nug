They take so long and misquote the time. They didn't even call to let me know that it would take almost an hour longer than quoted. They don't have good deals like they did years ago, and they pay zero attention to detail. They gave me my truck back with a huge piece of metal that held the mud flap sticking straight out. I could have killed a pedestrian with that, or scraped someone's nice car. Regardless I am in total disbelief about this. I asked them to take it off and they did... without an apology. I will NEVER go back and I hope that anyone who cares about their vehicle, their well-being and the well-being of others doesn't go there either.

I took my father here when he was visiting from France. The manager greeted us at the door and was very kind. He took us to the patio where we had a requested a table and informed us of their specials for that day. He seemed very involved and positive. He even let us know that our server was new and to make sure to let him know if there was anything that we needed. Our server, Jessica, was really great. If there was anything she didn't know she made sure to find out for us and she did not let my father's french accent deter her from giving us great service (tipping servers is not a custom in France, but I taught my father well!) The food was really good! We had their special, recommended by the manager, Ken. It was beef brisket sandwich with their house made bbq sauce. We also had loads of seafood. All of the seafood was fried so if that is not your style, you'll have to wait for their dinner menu. The lunch menu is different. We loved everything including the food, the service, the view and the ducks! I will definitely be back with my friends and family! Thank you Ken and Jessica!

I love this place! Even though it is kind of a far drive for me, I will not bring my cat anywhere else. The staff is amazing, the service is warm, the place is clean and they are open 24/7. What more could you ask for?!?!

My poor cat needed to see a vet ASAP for a fat lip... actually, a rodent ulcer. He had been here many times and was actually super comfortable. I'm amazed. The vet took her time and was very friendly. She told me to buy him vitamins and that they may be cheaper online. She also explained to me all options for future treatment in the case that antibiotics didn't clear his lip problem. She recommended many household changes and pointed potential causes for the lip. I made a couple of changes, got the antibiotic and he is all clear!  Not only that but his new vitamin is working and he loves it! I purchased on amazon as recommended.

The food is insane here! Although I must admit, it is hard for me to order anything other than the 'lovely bit'o salmon.' My bf gets the rosemary chicken (delicious!) and he is stuck on his fav as well. We did try a couple of appetizers and food off of our friends' plates and we are always pleasantly surprised at how delicious everything is :). The beer selection is always great! The service... hit or miss but this is one of the few places where I wouldn't let that steer me away. We come here to get our fix at least once every couple of weeks. YUM!!!!!

This place is terrible. It was my only night off and I called ahead to see if they could get me in. They told me it would be 15 minutes before I could get in. Almost an hour later they still hadn't said a single word to me. Thanks for wasting my only night off. I should have gone somewhere else. Now I have to do it myself! Just terrible. If you are understaffed and can't fit me in then Fing tell me. Don't make me waste MY time! I am furious.

I would have given petsmart 5 stars if it wasn't for the last few nightmare visits. Ever since I have had to get prescription food for my cat, shopping there has truly enlightened me about how terribly trained their staff is.  The first time I brought in my Rx (from my Scottsdale vet), I was able to purchase the food without trouble. The cashier told me "great, this Rx is on your file now, you no longer need to bring it in."  That was their first mistake.... total lie. The poor cashier had no idea, but she set me up for failure. Naturally, I casually misplaced the Rx over time since it was no longer a necessity in my mind.  The second time I went to go buy his food there, the cashier refused the sale because I did not have his prescription. When I told her that I thought it was on file under my name, she told me that "they don't do that here." I couldn't believe it! I was furious and drove all the way to my vet's office 30 minutes away to get the food there since my poor kitty at home was all out.  The third time, I had a new Rx and made sure to bring it. I bought the food but not without another cashier that had to call over a manager because she couldn't figure it out herself.   Unfortunately, I misplaced that tiny piece of paper again. So the fourth time, I called ahead. I talked to someone to ask how their system works and what I need to do to be able to regularly buy his Rx food at their store. It was a very confusing conversation... the clerk changed his story several times: first saying that my cat needs to be seen by their vet, then telling me that if I had an outside Rx that I would need to bring it every time, then finally saying that if I had purchased my Rx food there before under my phone number that it should work for future purchases. Needless to say, I didn't trust him and asked for the fax number so that I can have my vet send over the prescription. I asked if that would work, and he told me that I would have to buy the food on the same day because they would throw it away after, as they could not keep it on file (WHAAT???). Whatever... I had my vet fax over the prescription and headed to Petsmart later that night. The cashier, like usual, needs to call a manager over because she has no idea that they even had a fax machine. The manager then tells me that they never received a fax. After talking to him for several minutes,  he tells me that maybe the fax was sent to their on-site vet clinic which closes before the store does. He also told me that I should have gotten a "medicard" of some sort from them that allows me to buy the food anytime without my Rx (neither of the two times I showed up with my Rx did anyone mention this). I could go on and on about how furious and frustrated I was (and still am) but all I will say is their employees REALLY need to be more informed about how their system works, if they even really have a system. I gave my cat some good ol' tuna that night.  I still give them 2 stars because I've always loved their toy selection and friendly floor personnel. However, I will never shop there again.

This place is awesome. A step up from Panera Bread or Paradise Bakery! The food is very fresh, the menu well-thought-out and the staff is extremely friendly. I wish I knew my cashier's name, it is nowhere on the receipt (they should start doing that!)... but I would give him 10 stars! Super friendly and very kind! They also manage to keep the place very clean in spite of all the families bringing their messy kids lol. There is always a busser walking around. As far as the food goes, I have been going to this place and the Chandler location for 3 years now and I am IN LOVE with the chopped salad. It is a great mix of salmon, fresh green goodness and crunchy cool flavor with a delicious pesto dressing!  drool... I could live off of that salad. I also love their soups. The staff is kind enough to give you a sample if you are unsure ;) . I also just had their cheesecake for the first time yesterday, they have plenty of great pastries to choose from and freshly baked bread every day! Love it, I only wish I lived next door

I just ordered from this place. The pizza took forever and both pizzas were terrible. The toppings and cheese all slid to one side, with a third of it completely off the pizza and the pizza was cold when it arrived. Also, I ordered spinach on one of my pies. What they call spinach is not fresh, but rather frozen spinach that they threw on top of it. It is awful.  I will NEVER order from here again nor do I recommend that anyone else does.

I was so nervous to get my hair done because stylists always have a hard time with my long thick hair. Daniel did my hair, and I couldn't be any happier! My color is absolutely amazing. He helped me pick something that would keep the variety of tones in my hair, but still give me a fresh, deep red violet. He also convinced me to get rid of my damaged ends, which I was kind of attached to. However, he did not cut off too much and was very attentive to my fear of losing my hair :) I love it and will definitely be back!!!! Thanks Daniel!!! Can't wait for my next cut and color.

Terrible. They charge for debit. Might as well charge for cash too. Just stupid, dirty, ghetto.

This place just opened and I have been consistently suggesting that we go there when my OH wants to go out. I can't stop eating their bruschetta, they are all addictive. I plan on trying every single menu item, twice.  The beer selection is perfect; who can resist a good craft beer menu!?! I haven't tried their wine yet because I've been so busy drinking their beer, but I will definitely be changing it up soon! I'd like to start taking advantage of their happy hour though... they seem to have really great deals!  Service is always superb! One time, our bruschetta order came out wrong and they gave us a free one even though we begged them not to since we were going to order more anyway. The servers are very knowledgeable and extremely friendly, we love it!   Their location is so great, I am so happy that they opened up just across ASU and mill.  I will keep coming here every chance I get!
