My friend and I decided to try out TGI Fridays for a beer during the baseball game to get a bigger bang for our buck. For what we would pay for a small hot dog and 20 oz beer, we could get a great meal, larger beers, and great service, right?! Wrong.   The restaurant was not very crowded for a game night, yet we were denied a table overlooking the stadium. Twice. The manager asked us to visit the hostess stand to get a table, but they informed us there was a wait. NO ONE WAS IN LINE FOR THE RESTAURANT!   I had to get our own menus from the bar, after playing "let's avoid making eye contact, and maybe she will go away." After we ordered, three sets of people were sat in the tables we were waiting for, and their meals came out before our order!   Our waiter ended up offering us a free beer for the late arrival of our food, and ended up comping our entire check, but that will be my last visit "Front Row."   I'd rather pay $10 for a beer and $8 for a processed hot dog than to get snobbed by anyone in the service industry. All I wanted was a good time after a work day from hell, and to enjoy a Diamondbacks game ...

I work in an office building near the Biltmore, and my coworkers and I have ordered here often. We love Chinese food, and the food is definitely delicious. However, we have issues every time we place an order by phone.   The first time, I was told that the lunch special has soup, but that it would not be included on delivery orders. I then asked if the price would be less since part of the special would not come with the meal but they said no. I let that roll off my shoulder and accepted the delivery order.   The second time, the lady said they didn't deliver to our office and said the order would only be available for pick up. I explained that we have had delivery ordered before, but she said they were too busy and that we should call back later.   My final straw - 5 of us were ordering and 3 of us had credit cards. She said we should put the whole order on one credit card because they don't make money by running more than one. I am baffled that this restaurant would rather save money on credit card fees than to accept different methods of payment. Needless to say, our weekly office Chinese order will be from a different establishment.

I was visiting my sister in Las Vegas and needed to get my nails done after arriving. I called to see if the salon was busy, explained my time constraint before an event, and the nail tech met my needs!   There are iPads on each pedicure station to help keep the patrons entertained, but I found the conversations with the staff more entertaining.   My only regret is that I didn't get to experience some of the detailed nail art that I have seen displayed on their Instagram page. Needless to say, I will be back!

I so badly want to love this place ... The concept of having a restaurant and gaming area inclusive, being a supporter of bicycles, and literally RIGHT around the corner from my residence sounds like the perfect neighborhood bar!   However, I am disappointed in the service every time I go. Watching paint dry is a faster process than ordering a cocktail, and the bartenders seem more interested in each other than the customers. I loved the cocktail named "Room service" but I only had time to order one before my bill came at midnight; I showed up at 1030 ... Then, I was charged for 2 drinks on my tab!!! I'm not sure what their hiring standards are, but I've gone to the Yard different times of the day and have been utterly disappointed in the service Every.Single.Time. It really is quite a shame ... If they are going for a hipster version of "Dicks" where they treat everyone like crap as part of the experience, then I wish I would at least get a paper-made hat with a clever saying on it!
