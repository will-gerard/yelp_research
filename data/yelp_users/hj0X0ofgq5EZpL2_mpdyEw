Man oh Man!!! What a GEM!!! Found this spot about a 1 1/2 years ago...L O V E their fried green tomato sandwich! Have taken my friends and foodie, adult children (runs honest in the family) And everything we've had has been fabulous.   How can you not enjoy such a unique spot - a 1945 Diner with 8 stools and fantastic outdoor seating?!!

The rating is for customer service. Their pies get a 3. I've been visiting Mamma Mia's on and off for the last 6+ years. And their service has never been this consistently horrible. Last pie (9/20) was partially burnt, however we didn't realize that until we got home. When I called I was told I could bring the pie back. The owner wants to see his mistakes. If I had been thinking it through, I could have had them deliver one and pick up the burnt one. What I did say was I wasn't going to make the drive again, can they give a credit. They said $10 off another future order.  Back track - On 9/6, which was a Saturday, I ordered & paid for a pie online. When I went to pick it up, they were closed.  Liquor store next door was open.  And of course no one answered the phone. I disputed the charge with my bank and they asked if I had attempted to call. So I called again the following week (don't recall which day). The person who answered the phone said that the owner was suppose to have credited everyone and I should have received the credit. I hadn't. She also said there was a gas leak. That's a lie as the entire building and area would have been shut down. After some back and forth, I finally got the credit.  Now tonight.  Call it insanity - decided to use the $10 credit. Called in and proceeded to go back and forth and put on hold for 15 minutes to be told that the credit had been used. I told them that hadn't been the case...another hold...death hold. Hung up. Keep the $10 - not worth the headache and honestly way too many other choices. I like to give my money to those that appreciate the business.   Sayonara

A friend and I decided to meet here, I've been before to the place next door (the Pink Spot where they have homemade ice cream, desserts, salads, wraps,ect...)  We sat on the ZPizza side and ordered a veggie pizza with no olives. Service was quick, friendly and helpful. I love a crisp, thin & tasty crust...and this was pretty good!    I'll definitely be back.

LOVE this place!!! Every time I come (which isn't as frequent as I'd like due to proximity) everyone is super helpful and nice. I've only had their ice cream and WOW!!  Delish! Chocolate Peanutbutter - yumm! I look forward to exploring their menu.  Great vibe, urban setting & comfortable atmosphere. We've done the Z's pizza next door (they're joined) and that too was a great experience.   At first glance Parking looks to be an issue - however there is parking down the side and around back.

Happy Pup Happy Mom!!! LOVE this place and wishing I hadn't waited so long to visit!!  Just picked up my Pumpkin this afternoon from her first grooming here.  And what a happy & beautiful pup greeted me!!   Everyone is very friendly and helpful. They did a fantastic job on her and I completely appreciate the NO kennel!!! She gets to hangout with the other doggies which hugely reduces her stress.  I can not say thank you enough for that gift!!   I have a household of 3 pups and we will be visiting again soon!

Holy Hell is this place fantastic!! Have already been back after the initial visit. I'm still in the process of forgiving the bf for not introducing me to this place before. I mean - seriously - we've been together over a year and he's just now taking me here. I'm still mad (jk).  Haven't done any plates - just a la carte tacos! Because. TACOS!  YUM! And the horchata was outta this world! My goal is to make my way through the taco choices! So far - each one is delicious! And the salsa bar - fantastic!! About 13 different types...peanut, strawberry, pecan, tomatilla, roasted, etc...   The place is small. The staff hard working, friendly & diligent. XTRA tipping highly recommended as they are busting butt.

Can NOT say enough wonderful things about this place!! The staff, service, atmosphere & food!!! We had my daughters wedding dinner here (9/5/14)  and my son coordinated everything with Owen, the Manager & the Chefs Craig & Ben. Our party was an intimate 7 and from the moment we arrived we were treated with the highest of regard. Eric the Bartender started us off with the tastiest Sangrias, followed by several courses of appetizers (the chop salad was to die for!) and finished it off with their Porcini Filet Mignon - which was truly decadence!  We were full beyond measure and they packed us with to-go boxes for what we couldn't finish.  Absolutely every dish was beautifully presented and tantalizingly delicious!! I can not thank Owen, Craig, Ben, Eric and the staff of Citizen Public House enough for making such a monumental occasion so very special and personal.

The 1 star is for my salad & lack of Manager service.  The waitress did her job well, her Manager left her unsupported. My friend and I stopped in for lunch yesterday (a Sat). She ordered the BLTT - which she enjoyed. I ordered the blackberry, orange & brie salad. The salad was $8.50 and came out looking like a small side salade. I had anticipated getting a salad as a meal. When I asked the waitress about the size, she said it was because of the quality of ingredients...there were 4 brie triagles of approx 1/2 inch, two 1/2 pieces of orange, 5 blackberries and a tablespoon of walnuts.  And I'm being generous. I understand I'm in a bar & grill ordering a salad - however, these days that doesn't seem to be an issue in most locations. You get a decent salad. Not with this one.  The waitress said she'd send the manager over. My only suggestion that I was going to make was let people know that this isn't a meal size salade - that it's more a small side salad.   After this initial conversation - we never saw our waitress again. After a good 15 minutes a lady stopped by and asked if we wanted more water and took our plates. We then asked for the bill. The same lady brought the bill. Then our waitress stopped in to pick up the payment and asked if the Manager helped us or took the salad off the bill. (I wasn't looking to not pay, I just wanted them to inform their customers) We said we hadn't seen the Manager - she informed us the lady that took our plates and brought us water was the Manager. She had never said a word to us. Introduced herself or asked any questions. The waitress was stunned and very apologetic. She was a bit at a loss of what to do.   We left a decent tip for the waitress, It's not her fault that management is clueless and unprofessional.  Won't be back - too many other options.

It's been a long time since I could say that I have a mechanic. That go to place where you're not concerned about being scammed. I've been coming to AZ Auto Doctor in Scottsdale now for almost two years. They've done my oil changes, brakes & 90k service on an Xterra. Without fail - excellent service and fair prices.  Just got my rear brakes done. Great price, done quick & vehicle handles/responds well. Almost exactly a year ago they replaced my front brakes. That job, initially, didn't go so well. When I left they were squeling and felt 'rough' when i hit the brakes. I took it back and they adjusted them. I left - no better. At that point I was frustrated. Called and Eddie had me come back in. This time - they completely redid the brake job....and perfection.  People & businesses  make mistakes every day. I have a great appreciation for those that admit them and then fix them. These guys keep doing what they do with the same level of integrity and fairness on cost and I'll keep coming back.  PS - be nice if they cleaned the waiting area :D And it is a mechanic shop!

The one star off is because I can never get into the am classes - they're always full. I prefer working out in the morning and right now, I'm going in the afternoons.  Which means that I don't go as often as I'd like due to my other obligations in the afternoon.   With that said. Jabz rocks it and kick's my a$$ - pushing me in all the right ways!  The trainers are knowledgable, great with modifications and making sure people are keeping good form. And I greatly appreciate their motivating attitude! It's important to note that it's not a boxing gym - it's a circuit training system where you get to punch a few bags.  I bought the 15 session groupon and I'm on my 9th day. Even with enjoying this workout as much as I do, I don't know if I'll continue  because of the morning conflict.  However if a 5 or 6 am class isn't important to you - then I highly suggest you stop in and give this place a go!! The support is fantastic as is the workout!

My workouts have historically been on my own, at home type stuff using Insanity, Daily Burn, ect... and I've never really been a fan of gyms for a variety of reasons. Beginning of 2014 I started my rounds on trying out different small, privately owned gyms as I wanted more of a challenge than what I was able to accomplish on my own.  I was introduced to FieldFit in July 2015 by friends who knew the places that I had tried (Studio Fit, Crossfit & Jabz) I found were lacking in some combination of trainers knowledge and/or business integrity. I was discovering after more than a year of intense workouts that I began to experience 'twinges' in my knee's and shoulders, raising some concerns.  Without writing a book...know I found home. These guys handle you with care. Whatever your level of fitness. And have the expertise, skill and knowledge to back it all up. Whether you're coming off an injury, weight loss, muscle gain, training specifically for 'x', ect... I get pushed in all the right ways and called to task when my form is off. If I'm experiencing stress in any of my joints - they ensure to help me stretch it out and take things easier until my body is ready to go again. I've gotten systematically stronger, more flexible & better balanced with their personalized workouts for me - without the personal training price attached.   I've seen every age and physical ability in there...all being treated with the same level of respect. consideration. care. for what that person is wanting to accomplish. Truly, these boys are some of the best humans ~ Thanks guys.
