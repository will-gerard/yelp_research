I came here to. get a full set and a pedicure. My acrylics cracked on 4 of my nails within the first week. My pointer finger nail completely came off also in the first 5 days! They did not cut my cuticles and obviously did not sand my nails down enough for the acrylic to stick. I spent over 150$ and got the worst nail job I've ever gotten. I've been getting my nails done for over 6 years now. Go to infinity on greenway and 7th street. Don't waste your money on this over priced low quality salon.

This is THE WORST walgreens i have ever been to. Every single time I go, there is a huge line of people and ONE register open. The cashiers are moving as slow as possible... I can't.

My bf loved the soup (Tom young goong). I got the pad thai the first time, which was good.. even tho I'm not a noodle person.   The second time I got the yellow curry, and everyone on here says it's not spicy enough... um.. it was SO SPICY I couldn't even eat it. I threw almost all of it away. Had an awesome flavor, but I'm not a spice person.  I can barely handle hot fries.   Other than that it was good. Idk wtf ppl on here are b#tching abt..  The thai iced tea was amazing.    I'd go again, bc we live down the street. But I'll ask them for the MOST MILD yellow curry ever. I wish I could have eaten it bc it was soooo goood. Better than papaya thai in Tempe,  which is my fave.  ** edit: got the yellow curry again, but MILD this time. And I was right.... it was BOMB. so of course I order it like every single time I eat here. Which is kinda alot. Lol
