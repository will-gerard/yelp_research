We adopted our two cats from AAWL close to five years ago.  We were immediately impressed with their professionalism and cleanliness. I remember thinking that it was like a Garden of Eden for pets!  It's tucked away on a side street that might be difficult to find at first, but it's worth the drive. They do a thorough check of all would be pet-owners, down to the children in your home and pet allowances for leases.  We chose our cats, and our daughter had to come the next day to make sure that they got along. :) Five years later, we still sing their praises to anyone looking for a pet.  If looking to adopt, look no further!

Oh- Marie Callender's... where to begin? Stopped by for nostalgic reasons- it's been about ten years since my grandmother used to take me regularly.   I may start with the fact that I manage a restaurant myself, which makes me forgiving in certain aspects, but perhaps a little overly critical in others.  We waited at the hostess stand for quite some time.  The hostess was very nice I might add, but the other employee watching from a short distance without acknowledgment didn't go unnoticed. Our server was also very nice.  Here's my issue- food quality and management.  I ordered the salmon along with the salad bar.  The salad bar was okaaaayyy...had about three or four open holes where items should have been.  Now I'm aware that I wouldn't be having the salmon of my life here, but expected palatable.  This was neither.  I barely touched it.  Fishy and rubbery. Once the server noticed, she sent the manager over who barely looked me in the eye as she quickly dismissed my complaint.  I hate making a scene, so I didn't press the issue. The entree stayed untouched, and we paid the full bill...salmon as well.  Okay, I ordered it, yes.  I'm not one to look for a free meal by any means.  However, I surely will not make a guest pay for something they obviously didn't like, and did not eat because of poor quality.  Maybe if the manager was a little more sincere in her apology I wouldn't be writing this at all.

Don Lencho's is my favorite authentic Mexican food joint in the Valley.  The place is a hidden treasure tucked away in Peoria, I'm surprised more people don't know about it.  Always clean and inviting.  The staff always goes the extra mile to make sure the guest is at home and receives great service.

Good, but it takes a long time, even with drive-thru.  Still, it's worth it.  Only downfall is access to it.  You're not able to go in except through one exit off of the street, which you can't make a left turn out of.  And no access through the shopping center; however, through now fault of their own.  The access is just incovenient.

We took our Yorkie here last week and we were so pleased.  They squeezed us in on a moment's notice.  It was night and day compared to the grooming at Petsmart (our first dog, be forgiving :) haha)  Very nice and informed staff.  Highly recommend.

My boyfriend and I went there yesterday for an early dinner; we easily found parking at the "Parking Corral" and walked in.  There were multiple hosts waiting to greet us at the front door.   Right off the bat, we were impressed.  The patio is gorgeous, both upstairs and downstairs.  The booths are large and roomy, and I liked the long table next to the bar that can be used for couples or large parties.  They have an amazing wine cabinet, if you can call it that, more like a wine wall, that I'm trying to convince my boyfriend we need in our house.   We decided to go with the Apple & Gorgonzola salad and the Chicken Sandwich...the chicken sandwich has brie, basil pesto, and sun-dried tomatoes, nothing short of amazing.  As for the salad, they use a prickly pear vin, which pairs sinfully well with it. :)  Just the right amount or gorgonzola, not overpowering at all. He went with Blue Moon on tap and I chose Sangre de Toro for my wine.  We've been drinking Toro at home for years, and it's the first time I've seen it out and about at a bar.  Instant plus. Overall, we had a great time, and the price wasn't bad at all!  I was expecting to pay much more for what we received.  RnR...we're fans!  We can't wait to go back!

Looking for a new place to eat, we stumbled across Le Chalet this afternoon.  My boyfriend has read about it and made a mental note to try it.  We got there about 4 o'clock and were the only table.  The staff was so nice that I hoped a good review would help their business a little- as it turned out, they have many positive reviews!  We started with the Traditional Flammenkuchen- a recommendation from our server.  omg. I could eat this once a day for the rest of my life and die happy. They describe it as an oven-roasted tart with sour cream, bacon, seared onion, and Swiss cheese. Don't miss it. Tried a little wine and decided to go with the Matterhorn salad in a crepe shell (I'm going to try and attach a picture).  The tomato was cut like the shape of a rose, very cool. Best thing- 202 calories!  Being that I'm CONSTANTLY attempting to diet, their low-calorie menu was great.  Only complaint is that the prosciutto was cut into such large pieces, that it made it slightly difficult to eat in a salad.  I don't know about you, but cutting prosciutto in a salad bowl is not the easiest task.  All in all, we really enjoyed it and can't wait to go back.  We left the to-go container on the table and they even ran it out to us.  Very nice.

Love the new Sandbar at Desert Ridge!  The patio is so inviting, and a place like this is much needed in this area.  I'm pretty sure that this will be my new spot for strawberry margaritas during happy hour.  We came for opening night and tried the guacamole and mussels.  It was insanely busy, but I couldn't believe how quickly our order came out, considering it was their first night open and how many people were there!  The guacamole was great- I'm very picky about my guacamole, at some restaurants it gets a stale taste to it.  At Sandbar, however, it was fresh and nicely prepared.  The mussels were phenomenal.  I've always been more of an oyster gal myself; mussels always seem to come out a little too fishy for my taste.  However, ours came out very well.  Overall, we had a blast.  FINALLY, a great place in the Desert Ridge area! Kudos!

Brent from Off Camber is fantastic!  I've been going to Brent for years- faithfully following him from two salons because it really doesn't get better.  He's always consistent and my hair always turns out beautifully.   They have a pretty cool online booking system- it sends reminders on appointments and even emails a receipt.  Thanks, Brent!  Good luck with the new place!
