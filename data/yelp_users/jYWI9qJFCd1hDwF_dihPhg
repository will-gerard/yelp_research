This is where Marie Antoinette would eat, were she a contemporary Phoenician and not a deposed French ruler from the eighteen century. Total decadence. Total indulgence. Totally wrong but oh-so-right.   Brunch: cheese plate, eggs Benedict in a spicy hollandaise, Gruet mimosa.   Lunch: cheese plate, burger with dry jack cheese and pancetta on ciabatta, sweet potato fries, gin-cucumber martini.  Oh my god, the cheese list. I really hope I never become lactose intolerant. Because I don't think it would stop me from devouring cheese plates like they're going out of style, but it would make the aftermath upsetting. Anyway, their list is robust and I've yet to try something I don't like. The Roaring '40s blue is excellent. Idiazabal was like a Spanish manchego, but smokier. The manchego was hard and nutty and delicious. The Chimay Grand Cru made great use of its Belgian beer namesake and was smooth and a bit soft.  Would you think I was weird if I said the Hoch Ybrig tasted like a Swiss mountain meadow? Whatever, it totally did - floral and fresh and pastoral. I bet those cows were eating some sweet clover and spring blossoms.   Wine, cheese, bread. It's like a guaranteed homerun in my book. One problem - some of the sloooowest food ever. And not in that this-was-grown-within-a-four-block-radius way, either. Just slow. Like fucking molasses.   Order-in to food-received: 55 minutes. For three burgers, a macaroni and cheese and a cold turkey sandwich. During a late lunch amongst not more than five other tables. This only makes sense if the kitchen contains a bong. Or maybe a live pig.   Don't think about it, though. Just order another cocktail, consume your weight in cheese and, if you want to reenact my own experience, drool a little.   As Marie Antoinette would say (OK, probably not, since this is totally unverified and historically questionable, but fuck you for saying so), "Let them each cheese!"

Have you ever been to one of those pricey salons where you walk out with a trendy, perfectly coiffed 'do, every last strand in its place? Where the stylist carefully straightens or curls or teases your hair into a style so picture-perfect, it's the absolute zenith of hairstyles?  I hate those places.  More often than not, a hairdresser who's busy adding products and whipping out the curling iron is trying to style her way into a better haircut. And that just won't fly with me. Cuz when she pulls out that little hand mirror and spins me around, I want to see what the cut looks like, not what her Con-Air handiwork looks like.  That's why I trust Ide Mania's lovely and talented Amina, and only Amina, to give me a just-hip-enough, just-lazy-enough look that gets compliments with minimal effort.   In the three years I've seen her, she's moved from a beautiful (but wretchedly run) Tempe salon a mile from my home to a former bank branch in downtown Phoenix. She's raised her prices $10 (to be fair, at $55 she's still cheaper than many other Aveda stylists around town). She's become busy enough that I have to prebook my Saturday appointments weeks out.   None of this phases me at all. Hell, I'd probably follow her to Peoria, and I'm not even sure I know where Peoria even is.

Don't be fooled -- Mama Java's isn't a coffeeshop; it's actually a secret portal into Eugene, Oregon. Yes, really, right in that funky strip mall on Indian School, next to the Tuesday Morning.   They have it all: hipster baristas, art on the walls, laid-back, slightly funky vibe. They even have the requisite kooky, befuddled, aging hippie behind the counter. He can't quite remember your order, but it's OK, because he's probably going to make you something delicious anyway, and he won't be a dick when you tell him it's the wrong thing.  They've also got that special brand of uppity-ness that you only find in coffeeshops -- you know, the kind that leads the baristas to post handwritten signs forbidding you from using your cell at the counter. Again, it's OK. After all, if you're on the phone while order, you are, in fact, a total fucking douche.   The coffee's pretty tasty and the beans seem fresh, and they have a great setup for studying or working -- even tables in a little back nook that are perfect for groups. Free wifi, of course, and what looked to be a tasty small menu.   Now if only they could transplant some evergreens to block out Indian School Road...then it really would be like Oregon.

An Asian grocery the size of a Wal-Mart is pretty awe-inspiring all by itself, but there's really much, much more to Lee Lee than aisles of noodles and spices and lentils and rices (though they do have these as well, in spades, as well as all the requisite weird seafood and meat products that make Asian groceries so damn fun).   There's so much happening at Lee Lee, I go into a daze every time I enter. Seriously, my boyfriend has to herd me around, lest I spend 45 minutes choosing frozen Indian breads. (Paratha? Naan? Batura? Roti? Garlic, onion or plain?) Or trying to justify purchasing five pounds of lamb. Or considering the merits of roast duck.   Anyway, before I get sidetracked again, let's start where I always do -- the booze aisle. Lee Lee carries a wide variety of Asian beers, of course, plus some good sakes and plum wines. But there's always at least one too-good-to-be-true booze selection. Yesterday it was a half case of Widmer Hefeweizen for $6.88. I've also purchased Konig Ludwig Bavarian weissbier for $2.99 a six-pack, Carlsberg Elephant beer for $9.99 a case, Warsteiner mini-kegs for $7.99 and countless other delights at "fell off a truck somewhere" prices.   If that's not enough to get you to brave Lee Lee's jacked-up parking lot and hordes of chattering families of all ethnicities (united only by an uncanny ability to get in your way), consider this: Lee Lee is also home to aisles of non-Asian delights, like Jamaican jerk sauce and Mexican spices. And of course, my favorite -- the lovingly labeled "Holland foods" section. I don't .know why it's there, but  I do know that pickled herring is fucking delicious.  By the time I leave, my cart invariably looks like the shopping list for a dinner party at the United Nations.  A very drunken dinner party.

Never, ever, ever again. Ever.   Because even if I think your coffee blows, and even if I only gave you three stars (*gasp*), there's no excuse for talking shit about me -- loudly -- while I am forking over $10 for a sandwich. That's just a poor customer service decision, folks. As business owners, you should know that.   And just for clarification, I never wrote that your coffee tastes like shit. But I will now: Your coffee tastes like shit.   So, no more $12 chef salads. No more $3 croissants. And definitely no more of your fake-nice bitchiness or dirty looks when I walk by in the morning with my Cartel coffee. I will save my money for an establishment that treats me like a person.  PS -- look forward to a severe business decline as soon as the place across the way opens. I'll make sure to smile and wave as I walk by.

Otto's daughters are fucking hot.   I'm a straight lady and they may or may not be of age. But those girls are cuuuuute. Sometimes they dance to '80s and indie pop mix tapes in the back, too. So, you know, if that's your thing, that's gotta be worth at least a star.   Oh, what, you wanted to know about the pizza? It's fucking delicious. It's all thin-crusted and fresh and crispy. For by-the-slice, it blows Slices out of the water. It's also simple -- no Oregano's BS toppings (for the record, I like Oregano's pizza, too. But sometimes you don't want no rosemary-potato-goat cheese concoction; you just want pepperoni and some red pepper flakes).  The calzones and pizza rolls are enormous and full of warm goodness.  Their soda comes with crushed ice. Fuck you if you don't know why that's awesome.   With girls that cute and pizza that good, Otto better watch out.

You know when you absolutely adore a restaurant and it's like they don't even know you exist? Like you're in some endless John Hughes film where you never, ever get to that final birthday cake scene? I hate unrequited love.   But at Haji Baba, the feeling's alllll mutual, baby.   No, really. They love me. I swear. Stop laughing.   The bestest service, the nicest chitchat and the friendliest not-creepy flirting. And, of course, the most delicious hummus (with a pickle on top).  OK, so maybe everyone gets the hummus. But does everyone get a big smile and a compliment from the kitchen staff?   Maybe it's because I always stop by after work, gussied up in heels and other lady-things. Maybe it's because I tip on takeout orders. Always. Or maybe it's just because I shop the store like I mean it: canned goods, feta, olives, pita, maybe some naan, baklava, wacky Eastern European chocolate, baba ganoush, spices, pistachios, etc. etc. etc. Not to mention the dirt-cheap, super-tasty kebab, shwarma and koubideh.   And while Haji Baba may be the Sam Schoeffling to my Molly Ringwald, Long Duk Dong has never made an appearance during my meal.

Wacky sandwich! Damn, I love me some wacky sandwich.   Backstory: Someone left a Lee's Sandwiches menu on the kitchen counter. It could have been me; I'm really not sure. But I spotted it while making coffee, then spent the next four hours lusting after a ham, head cheese and pate bahn mi.   Yes. Ham, head cheese and pate. Fuck you. It's delicious.  But it's also in Chandler. I think. Gilbert? Edge of Mesa? I don't really know, but what I do know is that the corner of Dobson and Warner requires that I cross both the 101 and the 60. Both of them. In one trip. I was tired just thinking about it.   Instead: Arai Pastry. Japanese sandwiches. Not the same as bahn mi, no, no at all. But it was Euro-Asian goodness, and that's what mattered.  Spicy teriyaki chicken topped with a slice of American cheese (wha?), spicy mayo (not "chili aoili," mind you -- Arai is not that kind of place), jalapenos, lettuce and tomato. On a nice big wheat baguette.   Spicy. Random. Delicious. And thanks to good ole American ethnocentrism, my stomach is more than happy to lump all Asian sandwiches together under the same umbrella. Hunger solved.   Thanks, wacky sandwich!

I might still be a virgin if it weren't for alcohol. Thank god I discovered it early, before all my pesky "standards" kicked in.   No, I didn't get my first drink from Top's. Or even my thousandth drink. But I do like to think that if I had, I could have had those standards and still gotten some play at the same time.   Why? Because Top's has everything, from the finest of Belgian beers and pinot noirs designed to lure me in to the loveliest bourbons perfect for letting my guard down to the lowest-of-the-low canned beers for when I've just plain given up and taken off my pants.   If Top's were a burnout from a dive bar and I were still 19, I would sooooo take him home. Only this time, I would cook him breakfast and let him stay awhile.

Lovely, lovely, lovely. Set in a pretty little old house just two blocks off Mill Avenue, House of Tricks has that sunny garden vibe that's all too rare here in Tempe.  When I want to ditch the office for a leisurely lunch (all too rare these days), House of Tricks is my hands-down favorite spot. A glass of wine, a shady spot in the garden, a gourmet sandwich or salad and some gossip with a friend. Perfect.   Lunch at Tricks gets five stars, easy. But Tricks has two downsides:  - Closed on Sundays, when I most want to pair my pedicure afternoon with a fancy lunch and pretend I'm a lady. - Dinner is only good, not great -- and it's very pricey (entrees alone range from around $20 to $35).  Go for the atmosphere. Go for the sun-filled patio. But if you ask me, just go for lunch.

I never thought I would be thanking French colonialism for anything, but Vietnamese sandwiches are a really fucking good idea.  Buttered baguette topped with delightful roast pork, veggies, peppers and cilantro? Brilliant. Just $2.85? I'll take three.   Plus, at Lee's, you can eat your tasty treat in an eerily efficient, sterile cafeteria. Trust me, it adds to the je ne sais quoi of the whole thing. Throw in a super-sweet, super-creamy iced coffee and a trip to Lee Lee afterward, and you've got yourself a pretty perfect afternoon.  So yeah, L'Indochine francaise may have set the stage for the Vietnam War. But it also gave us delectable sandwiches at low, low prices. Let's just call it even.

Cheap pedicures are everywhere. But so is foot fungus.  So when I want a $20 foot fix, I look for some degree of cleanliness. Thankfully, Paulene Nails delivered -- and then some.  To whit: Hot. Stone. Massage.  Yes, really, included in the $20 pedicure. And I saw the girls doing manicures give straight-up backrubs. With a $12 manicure.   One complaint: Rounded, not square. Rounded like a quarter. Rounded like first base. Rounded like my ass. Just....rounded. Please?

I hemmed and hawed over whether Cafe Istanbul was a three-star or a four-star joint, but the belly dancer pushed it over the top. Four stars.  But let's take a step back.   I don't actually like belly dancing, really. I knew these girls in college who got really into it. They were the kind of girls who wore anklets and gushed about how they had studied abroad in Chee-lay and actually used the term goddess when they weren't talking about salad dressing. I'm from Oregon, so I probably knew dozens of these girls. I am not one of them.   No, the belly dancing is awesome for an entirely different reason -- it makes my gay friend very uncomfortable. This amuses me to no end. While he tries to avoid eye contact, I smile at the dancer encouragingly, using my best "come hither" look. She comes to the table, gyrating just inches from my friend's mortified face. I am gleeful all night.   They also have food. It's Lebanese, and it's pretty good. In addition to the standard "stuff in a pita" fare, they have some interesting dishes -- like a pizza-esque item filled with ground lamb and spices. Yumm.   In terms of Middle Eastern food on Apache, I prefer both Haji Baba and Tasty Kabob. But I'll definitely be back. Just as soon as I can trick my friend into it.

Drinking + Arcade Games. This should be an obvious winner, right? Wrong.  Oh, how wrong.   Eating here is like eating in a casino, only less classy and with worse food.   Beers are overpriced but absolutely necessary to make it through the event.   Those combo deals that include beers and a game card seem like a good idea, until it's 45 minutes later, you're out of points, you're nowhere near drunk and you've already spent $40.  If you go late, try not to get syphilis when you walk by San Felipe's.

Dear Tempe Marketplace,  This is the most upsetting place I can think of in my immediate vicinity. If I ever commit suicide, it will be here.  You really are an easy target, aren't you?   Your "authentic" restaurants of every variety aren't fooling anyone.  Don't get me started on the unwalkable parking lot that I'm forced to traverse in order to hit Target and the Coffee Bean in the same trip.   And for fuck's sake, stop playing '90s top 40 songs in the parking lot. At earsplitting levels. If I wanted to listen to Matchbox 20, I'd do it at home, alone, in total shame, like a normal person.   Waste of space, waste of resources, waste of time.  But I'll totally be back next week when I need TP or want to see a movie, k?   See you then! Sara

I don't care how many interior designers you hired to hodge-podge together your "authentic" Southern décor, Lucille. Your screen door opens onto a suburban mall parking lot.   Porch chairs from the '40s, old-timey chandeliers and your great aunt's wallpaper. The only thing missing from this fake Old South experience is a whites-only drinking fountain. Guess the marketing folks thought that might be just a bit *too* authentic.  The other thing missing? Flavor. Sure, you heap on the sides and your fried green tomatoes are tasty, but this pulled pork is dry and boring, there's too much sugary crap in my cocktail and my biscuit is like a butter-covered rock.   Might I add: You mention "St. Louis-style" left and right, which I do believe is north of the Mason-Dixon line. So unless you want to argue the effects of the Missouri Compromise, I'm pretty sure St. Louis ain't part of the South you're trying reeeeeal hard to imitate. Even more baffling, your website says the original Lucille got all her recipes from her grandma in Greenville. So which is it?   It's neither. It's a corporate creation myth written by some copywriter in an office park in Thousand Oaks who was told to make the brand "feel real."  And it does feel real. Real boring.

Nowhere inspires my wrath more than Tempe Marketplace, except maybe a Super Walmart parking lot. But I think they're building one of those here, too. Add in a Babies 'R' Us and you'd hit the slit-my-wrists trifecta.  Kabuki would probably get three stars from me if it weren't located in the midst of this fakey-fake "urban experience" mall bullshit. But it is, so it doesn't.  Plus, they make their iced tea with tap water and it tastes like shit.   But coworkers looooove lunching at Tempe Marketplace. It's close to the office, and it's easy to drive and park there (never mind that we could walk to Mill Ave.) So OK, fine. I'm game, unless it's Maria Maria.  I've been here twice -- once for lunch and once for happy hour. Well, we tried to go for happy hour. It ends at 6:00. Fuck you, too, Kabuki. I work too late for that bullshit.   Next time I'll just go to Ra, where I might get severely injured eardrums from the ear-splitting club music bullshit. But at least they have cheap HH prices 'til 7:00. And they're on my drunk bus route home.

Taking the bus in this land o'suburban sprawl gives me the holier-than-thou glee that I can only imagine born-again Christians must feel when looking down on my sorry soulless ass.   Really. It's awesome. You can check out routes at http://tempe.gov/tim/Bus/Orbit.htm or http://www.valleymetro.org/Default.asp.   I take the Jupiter, which runs near my house and drops me a few blocks from the office. And despite others' experiences, it's only been sketch-city once, when I would have sworn a methadone clinic was on my route.   Usually, it's just ASU students, kooky old professors in orthopedic shoes and a couple teenagers skipping class. And me, the pseudoprofessional sorta grown-up.  Honestly, I am the scariest person on the bus most days. For serious.  There's just one drawback, which I'm even loathe to mention, given my far-too-earnest desire to have you join me on my route. But alas.  The fucking bus. Won't run. On time.  Maybe it's cuz I'm German as all get-out, but I expect the damn thing to approximate a schedule. And, you know, if there's a construction detour, it should take the detour consistently, or not at all.   But I'm still giving those adorable little blue buses four stars, in the hopes that you'll give it a shot.   It's not bad, I promise. Plus, I really want y'all to support some proposed service expansions, like extending the hours on weekends to midnight or even 2:00 am.  Because at the end of the day, I'm just a drunk looking for a free ride home...and some moral high ground.

I want to go here so bad. I guess maybe Cartel just doesn't want me.  I have tried to visit this lovely-sounding cafe no less than three times. Each time, it was closed. Cartel, are you EVER open?   Visit #1, 7:45 am on a Tuesday. Closed.  OK, this one is my fault, I guess. I assumed a coffee shop would be open early in the morning -- you know, before people go to the office. No. You open at 8:00. I am sad. I go to the Starbucks by the office.   Visit #2, 8:15 am on a Saturday. Closed. The sign says you open at 8:00 on Saturday. You are not open. Pulling away, I think I might see you pull up. But I have to go to the airport, so I can't wait around for you to unlock the doors and start up the register and make some coffee. Instead, I drink airport coffee (and I wasn't even in a terminal with a Starbucks). It ruins my day.   Visit #3, Saturday after Fourth of July. Closed. Yeah, it's the day after a holiday, I know. But you're already closed on Sundays. So....I go to Solo Cafe instead. Their coffee is also quite good (though not roasted onsite or bought via direct trade). But it's good. And they're open.  Thing is, for years I've wanted nothing more than a little local roastery to displace my crippling addiction to Stumptown Coffee, which I order from Portland for obscene shipping fees.   So please, Cartel. Please. Please. Please. Figure out your hours so I can spend some damn money in your shop. I will immediately update my review.   Please?

Aw, Cartel. You've won yourself a spot in my cold, dead heart: Better hours, better setup, better everything. You have achieved (near) perfection.   Plus, now that it's fall and the weather's cooled down, I can ride my bike right up to the big garage-style warehouse door in the back. Like the cool kids.  And even though I'm not actually cool, the baristas here are really nice. Hipster style without the hipster pretension. I like it.   Perhaps most of all, I just plain started feeling guilty about giving three stars to a place I frequent at least twice a week. And as I have said before, guilt's a bitch.   Now that I'm absolved of my sins, I think it's time for some coffee.

Five Stars. Why? Because it's damn near impossible to get a decent espresso pull in Tempe, and this place does it. Plus, it's close to my house (in Phoenix terms, at least) and to me, that counts for a lot.  Did I mention that the owners are really, really, really, really nice? Really. Nice. And they care about their coffee in a way I haven't seen since I left Oregon (shout out to Stumptown in PDX and Full City in the Euge).  The coffee is freshly roasted -- from Cafe Cortez here in town -- and the atmosphere makes you forget you're in a strip mall (not a bad strip mall, but still).  Please, please, please go here. Give them your money. They deserve it, and you'll be a better person for it. Promise.

Who told Carlos Santana to open a restaurant chain? Between his god-awful shoe collection (apparently designed exclusively for hookers and the colorblind) and his collaborations with Rob Thomas (is that guy still around?), I would have thought he was pretty busy. But nope, no such luck.  Enter Maria Maria, conveniently located at our newest soon-to-be-rundown fake-urban mall, Tempe Marketplace. It is, of course, a chain. But you knew that. It's pretty inside, though, and arguably less crass than some of its neighbors (*cough* Lucille's *cough*).   Work lunch. Not my choice, but I'm game. Wait, how much for some enchiladas? $17? And no lunch menu? You've got to be fucking kidding me, hombre. I'm all for Nuevo Mexicano but we are at the goddamned MALL, Carlos. And that's a lot of dinero for some tortillas and beef.   The food was...fine. Not gross, just boring as hell. The guacamole was pretty good, but considering its size (not huge) and price (I forget - maybe $10) it wasn't memorable. If you're prepared to go the pricey guac route, just go to Los Sombreros instead.  When it comes to Maria Maria, I think Carlos said it best: "Just forget about it."

You know that episode of Seinfeld where George eats a pastrami sandwich while banging his girlfriend? Well, if he'd been eating Pizza A Metro, I'd totally understand.   So. Fucking. Good.  My friend and I split the cheese ravioli in a creamy tomato sauce and a pizza with sausage, broccoli and mozzarella for lunch.  The ravioli were like little pillows of heaven filled with the silkiest melt-in-your-mouth ricotta I've ever tasted. The pizza had that chewy-crispy crust thing happening, and the tomato sauce was incredible - simple, fresh, still a little pulpy.  Everything was homemade. And when I say "everything," I mean they make their own MOZZARELLA, people. Yes, mozzarella. I know how to make a lot of stuff from scratch -- bread, pasta, pastry dough, whatever -- but cheese? I've got no fucking clue.   Not only does Pizza A Metro have a clue, but they're so goddamned nice, too. Case in point: After chatting with the owner throughout our meal, he brought out a slice of the tiramisu. No fanfare, no warning. Just set it down and walked away. We practically licked the plate.   Go there. You won't be disappointed.   But if you see me ordering takeout, just pretend you don't know where I'm headed with it.

Why do craft stores always smell like cinnamon?   Maybe there's some scientific study the Michaels people commissioned where they found that the "Scent of Christmas" causes otherwise sane people to spend obscene amounts of money on those rubber stamps and scrapbooking scissors. I don't know but it freaks me out.  It also makes me sorta hungry. But what it doesn't do is make me want to buy anything.   And the woman in a cat hair-covered black velour tracksuit blocking the yarn aisle ain't helping things either.

I love me some Top's, and so of course I love me this bar just as much. Perhaps too much, but that's a discussion between me and my liver, thankyouverymuch.   Anyway, Taste of Top's has a really well-chosen selection of beer on tap and wine by the glass, all reasonably priced, and all connected to Tempe's friendliest, funkiest, best-stocked liquor store, where you can ask for pretty much any bottle you'd like.   It's also got sweet bartenders who don't mind if you bring your Thai food or pizza in while you drink. Who don't give your friend a hard time when she gets wasted and breaks a glass. Who remember you a few days later when you're buying a sixer next door, even though they've only been open a couple weeks. Who generally have a good attitude and an even better pouring hand.   Typical Tempe neighborhood crowd, minus the dipshits, douchetards and assorted skanks of Mill Ave. Minus the trying-too-hard hipster scum who congregate around Casey's pretending to be too good for said douchtetards and skanks before paying their bar tabs with their parents' credit card and tottering off on a fixed-gear bike they don't even know how to ride as well.  Thank fucking god.  Scratch that. Thank fucking Top's. Tasty, tasty, tasty Top's.
