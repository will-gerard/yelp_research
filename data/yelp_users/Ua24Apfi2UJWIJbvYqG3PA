Lovely store with a seemingly great selection. Not so great service. We were ignored for most of our short visit. We came in on a slow Sunday afternoon. We weren't really greeted. There was no,"hello, how are you? How can I help you?". There was literally no one else in the store. We wandered a bit while my boyfriend looked at styles he liked and I picked a few as well. We settled on a couple we both liked and asked for my size. She said she didn't have either. I have a larger foot so I expected some difficulty, but it would have been nice if the saleswoman had been more helpful and perhaps offered to special order the size or see if another store has it as it's normally available at larger locations and online (I work in sales and do this routinely). Nothing. Then finally when she was sick of playing the,"what about this?" game, she offered to see what in the store that they did have in my size. It was a special event shoe not at all what I was looking for. Still no offer for additional help. I was really disappointed. When I'm willing to drop a thousand dollars in a few pairs of shoes I expect better help than that.

Amazing place! The staff always goes above and beyond. They carry many different items and costume pieces, accessories, SFX makeup etc. There are so many great options.

This store is a great find, but only because of the scarcity of lingerie/sexy stores in the valley. I absolutely LOVE the customer service and every time I've come in, the employees are fabulous, helpful, and pleasant. Everything that makes for great customer experience... Now for the downside. I've been coming to this store for a very long time and the selection has progressively gotten worse and worse. As have the policies. I work in nightlife and am not a stripper and have ALWAYS received a discount due to an employee asking me about my job years ago. They've now changed this policy to a stripper only discount. In my job we are to create new, sexy looks every week so I used to drop in all the time for outfit staples, then just the basics after the selection got worse. I'd send a ton of my coworkers here as well, why not support a local business willing to cut us a deal instead of us going online? Then came the requirement of having a dance license, even though I had been getting my discount for 3 years, it was taken from me. That was the last straw. Lingerie Superstore no longer has a competitive edge so I, nor many girls from my company give them our patronage. Instead we use a local online retailing giant that has unbeatable prices, great return policy, special company discounts, infinite product, and 24/7 customer service. I hate to take my business elsewhere, but I prefer to be treated as a valued customer and be rewarded for my loyalty. Basic business lessons. So my advice to shoppers, it's worth a visit if you're nearby and curious. Otherwise, don't bother.

My friend and I stopped in this Friday afternoon for a couple of drinks and some small bites at the bar. When we came in the hostess said that it would be a 45 minute wait for a table which is to be expected in this area on this date at this time. However, the service left quite a bit to be desired. I understand trying to keep the flow going, but being asked if I needed a drink or if I was going to order dinner every two minutes got really old really fast. After the fourth tome being asked in 15 mins, I asked for the bill and abruptly left. Ugh, so annoying!!

5 stars mostly for service by KELTON. Great guy busting his ass on a sunday afternoon. He was polite, informative, attentive, and genuine. We grabbed a light snack and some drinks on the patio. The weather was perfect! The chairs are AMAZING at the low tables, so super comfy. When we came in the hostess said there'd be a ten minute wait for a patio seat so we grabbed a seat at the bar to wait. From what we saw the interior was awesome! That place must be hopping on a friday night. Our table was ready in two minutes so we headed outside and were greeted by Kelton. We got the Moonstone Lemongrass Coconut sake to start. It's thick, unfiltered, coconutty goodness. Wow! So good. For the nomz, we grabbed salmon sashimi(my favorite and hint: its good pretty much everywhere), something with halibut and sriracha, and a roll I don't remember. I just know the roll had jalapeno, crab, tuna, and garlic sauce. The salmon was delicious but could have been skinned better, I hated the halibut (but my partner loved it!). It was very light, a little dry, with no flavor. The roll was delicious and extra spicy! The menu is huge, we were trying not to order much as we were planning on a big dinner. Our server was excellent and gave a great dinner recommendation. Ask for Kelton!

You really can't call yourself a chinese take-out connoisseur until you've had Chou's. Nestled in a desolate shopping plaza next to a questionably and continually empty thai(?) hole in the wall, Chou's continues to hit the mark with it's yummy chinese comfort food and specialties. Like you'd expect the menu is large. I haven't had most of it because I'm boring, well... not really, but I'm just one of those schmucks that gets the same thing every time. Every. Single. Time. I can't help it, I love the classics: pan-fried noodles veggies only, fried dumplings, and their specialty, BEEF PIE. Oh sweet, bovine goodness, marinated and fried to perfection. So good to my soul, so terrible to my waistline. Anywho, staff is reasonably friendly and they speak very poor english, but who cares. If you're dining in, it can be loud sometimes and make sure to clarify with your waiter/waitress what you are ordering, sometimes the menu can be a bit confusing. That pretty much it, happy eating!

I freaking love this place! I made the switch from EWC and I couldn't be happier. The staff is pleasant and highly skilled. This is only my second visit but I will definitely be coming here regularly for my service. The waxers are thorough, they care about leaving you smooth and do so in a timely fashion. If you can make this your regular waxing spot, just do it. You'll be so happy!

Great food, decent prices! Excellent for brunch but get here early! We like to come and sit at the bar. This time I got the crabby omelet, biscuits and gravy, and a waffle. They were all excellent. I highly recommend the double mimosa too ;)

Dr. Heffner is amazing! She has great bedside manner and she's nice and personable. I have zero bruising and my appointment was a breeze. She made me feel really comfortable and really listened to my concerns as well as giving some great suggestions. She is extremely knowledgeable and answered all of my questions. Finding her office is easy and she is totally flexible with her time. Her follow through is timely and she's extremely easy to reach. So glad I chose to go to Dr. Heffner!

TERRIBLE SERVICE. I wish I had gotten the hostess's name. We weren't able to be seated without a reservation which is totally understandable as there was an event in the evening, but it was hardly 3pm and the outside dining area was almost empty. I've worked in the service industry and would never speak to anyone that way. The way in which our group was addressed, like we weren't good enough. It truly hurt my feelings. The girl at the stand looked miserable and it definitely showed in her tone of voice. She didn't offer reservations for a different day, she didn't offer to notify us if space opened at the bar, she was completely unapologetic and seemed like she just wanted us to get out of her face. So disgusting.

Went in for dinner on a sunday night, no need to book a reso. We were seated promptly and Travis came to greet us. He was (super cute ;]) very professional and got right down to business, extremely attentive the entire meal. We had the deep fried deviled eggs, NY strip, king crab, and mac and cheese. The deviled eggs were yummy, but very rich. The NY strip was PHENOMENAL. We got it with no fix-ins just pure beefy goodness. The king crab was pretty good. The crab was a little old though. The mac and cheese was absolutely delicious! As for drinks, I had basil limeade and kept 'em coming. The drink is actually huge and packs a whollop. Definitely try it! So, the service is excellent (ask for Travis), the NY Strip is to die for, the king crab is sub par, and I'm assuming all of the sides are delicious. One thing to note: there is a very nice wine list and extensive reserve list, definitely worth checking out). I'm looking forward to coming back. I really want to check out their happy hour!

Excellent juice and fresh treats at a great price. I normally grab a pb bowl (acai, banana, strawberries, dates, cashew milk) and some sort of juice. Healthy and nomtastic!! The shop itself is clean, quaint, and small. The staff is friendly and fast. Very good neighborhood vibe. They also sell juice for a juice cleanse if you need it!

Wow, so rude! Went in for a quick fill and was greeted by no one. There was no one at the front desk but several nail techs looked at me and said nothing. Not even a smile! I stood there for 5 mins then left. This place stays busy because of one artist that stays in high demand (english proficiency and can actually do great nail art). The others are subpar. This is my second try with Polish me pretty, but I'm done. Bad customer service, way overpriced, and only one talented artist. Everyone else gets her overflow. If you can't book with Nancy, don't bother. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere friendlier and worth your money.

I love this theater! Everything is new and clean, facilities well-maintained. The actual viewing rooms are spacious and have super comfy reclining chairs. And the staff!! THEY ROCK! They're attentive and really friendly. I was banging on about a particular snack that I loved and out of nowhere someone popped up with a coupon. What great customer service! I highly recommended making this your new go to movie spot. Parking is a bit iffy, I always park in the lot right behind the theater on university and ash, NE.

Samuel is awesome! I am natural and have been for the past two years. I have been so terrified of going to anyone after having my hair wrecked for so long getting relaxers. I heard multiple glowing reviews of Samuel, and I really really needed a good blow out and trim. when I went in I was a bit nervous, it was my first time in a salon in a year. Samuel was very courteous, funny, and knowledgeable. he talked to me about the wrong products I was using on my hair and how my low maintenance routine was destroying my hair. He used this fabulous product line on my hair, changed my understanding of what my hair can actually do, and how I could wear it and care for it. I trust him and his advice. At this initial appointment he washed and conditioned my hair, massaged my scalped, detangled my neglected hair, blew it out, flat ironed, and then cut 3 inches off! He gave me the option of trimming little by little, but it's just hair, and if you hold onto the scraggly hair it'll ruin what you have. Plus, healthy hair looks so much better! I was so amazed by what my hair actually looks like when he finished up. I had always thought that my hair was coarse and would never fully straighten, but I was wrong. He showed me just how wrong I was. This week I am going in for a Brazilian blowout. I'm very nervous but Samuel has assured me that we can control how much curl to take out. That has been my main concern. Being natural and taking care of growing out my curls has been a nightmare. I love my curls I just want them easier to manage. If you are natural and in need of an amazing stylist, please call Samuel. He will get you right in life!

I haven't dined-in here yet, but I work near by and have ordered lunch here a few times. It does look great inside: new, clean, great screen set up too. Staff is friendly! Food is a bit of a deviation from regular sports bar fare which earns them major brownie points. The menu is a pretty good size with great variation. I was even surprised to see crab mac and cheese, which I rarely ever see in the valley, it's next on my list to try. Food is always ready fast, prices are awesome, food is delicious and we never have issues or discrepancies on our large lunch orders. The Draft is off to a great start!

Been here a few times now and I love it! Really big, open space. Lovely outdoor area. Casual, nicely done interior as well. Food is great, but limited menu options, but it will probably expand soon. My favorites are the turkey pastrami sandwich, cheese curds, and brats, so good! Service is pretty good. Looks like it has 2 bars inside and 1 that isn't up yet, outdoors. Im looking forward to frequenting this place when it heats up. It's got such great potential for a sunday funday spot.
