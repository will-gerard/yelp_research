Unfortunately, I cannot give less than one star, but I am terribly disappointed with this place.  Save your money ladies, truly.  My first experience was horrible, but I decided to give them another chance, and I wish I didn't.  Waste of my money!!! I cannot get anyone to respond to me from customer service, but I will be persistent and not give up.  I want my money back!!! They canceled on me because of a special event, but.... The catch is.... You can come in and pay full price.... Well, I already paid for my service, so I refuse to pay twice.  Honestly, I haven't heard a good thing about this place.  Stay away and go to primp and blow, there are many other places that will be happy to have you.

I love it here!! I have been going to Kristi for quite some time.  She is a perfectionist and always accommodating.  I wouldn't trade her for the world!

My son has been attending Arizona Shotokai for over a year now and I could not be more pleased with his achievements and with his Sensi Ralph Palomino.  He is truly one of the best instructors I have ever seen. We are so blessed to have found him.  I highly recommend this dojo if your child is interested in karate.  It is by far the best in the valley.  Thank you!
