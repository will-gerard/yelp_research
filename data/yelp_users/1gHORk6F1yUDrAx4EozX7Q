Food was good, service was great. Being able to make a reservation on Yelp = amazing.

I bought the Groupon for the gel mani/pedi 2 months ago and tried calling them at least once a week since then with no answer, ever.  Finally got ahold of them today, and the girl who answered the phone could not have been more rude. I tried to schedule something for 2 weeks out and she said they don't have availability until October 19th, but my Groupon expires on October 7th. When I explained that to her, I got no apology, no nothing. I'm only giving them one star because I can't give them zero. Terrible customer service, Scottsdale Beauty Bar.
