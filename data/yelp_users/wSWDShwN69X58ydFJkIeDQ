Let me preface this with We Love Village Tavern!   We've been going there nearly monthly for over 4 years. This last time, our service was just terrible! If this had been our 1st visit we'd never go back. It was interesting to note that all the tables around us that ordered alcohol received stellar service. MMMMMM It started with ordering drinks, sorry only Arnold Palmer's for the table. Then appetizer, which was great. We had the Colorado Chips. Homemade potato chips with bacon, cheese and BBQ sauce. How bad can that be??? Then we ordered our entrees. But NO ONE ever removed the dirty dishes from or appetizers. MMM... So we flagged down someone to fill our water glasses, all the while staring at dirty dishes on our table. Finally we did find our server to refill our drinks, thinking he'd take the plates with him, but NO, there they sat. Finally when our entrees were served we asked that the dirty plates be removed. Got a roll of they eyes, almost like saying, "that's not my job". But she took the plates non the less. Not 1 single time during our dinner did our server or anyone else ask how our meal was or how we were doing. We did everything but fill our own water glasses. BUT, the tables on both sides and across from us were attended to like royalty! My partner even ran into the manage in the men's room, and discussed our 'lack' of service. Did he stop by the table after that??? NO, or at least not until we'd paid the tab. He then stopped by and gave us 2 cards. 1 for a free appetizer and 1 for a free dessert on our next visit. So, let me get this right....you are asking me to come spend more money with you in order for you to make up for the terrible service I received this time? Well as I started this tirade with, if this was the 1st visit with Village Tavern, I'd NEVER go back.  But, I've been going there for years and years and years. Even before moving to AZ we'd dined with them. Starting back in 2003 when we were on a vacation here from Chicago.  Will I go back? Yes with trepidation, but I will go back.

Can I just say I love El Encanto.  I took clients there for lunch the other day.  They are down for the 'Season' from Chicago.  They were just enamored by the atmosphere.  Yes the birds can be bothersome, so don't sit by the pond!  At any rate, the service is always good, the food is fresh and piping HOT.    My favorites are the Chili Verde and the Pollo Fundito!  YUMM!  The Chili Verde is slow roasted pork smothered with green chili...so good!  The Pollo Fundito is a chicken burrito smothered in queso blanco and run under the broiler...double YUMM.  It's a bit kitchy, but the service is consistent, the food fresh and tasty, and the whole El Encanto story is charming.  When you are in Cave Creek, Go, no RUN to El Encanto and don't forget the margaritas...so good!

Another amazing meal at Maggiano's!  Thank you to Tracy for her great service and attention to our meal. Eggplant Parmesan is the best!  What a deal, but 1 pasta/entree, take one home for only $12.95!!!  Love Maggiano's since living in Chicago years ago. Go enjoy the food and great service. If you've not tried Maggiano's family style entrees, you need to make a reservation and go now...!

WoW...we'd never been to Haus Murphy's and boy did we have a blast!  We met our dining partners there, neither of which had even heard of the place.  Both being AZ natives and all...?  But at any rate the service was A+ the food was A++ and the Entertainment sublime.  Just what you would want from a German Restaurant.  Reminded us of the places we'd eat at in Chicago...!   We had the appetizer 'Fladenbrot Pizza' what a great combination of flavors!  Then on the 'Brie en Croute'...another triumph! followed by their signature 'Giant Pretzel' and GIANT it was. A couple of the diners had the "Best" seller, Jäger Schnitzel, one had the Steak Schnitzel, and I had the Nürnberger/Kassler (combo for one).  The consensus of the table was mine was THE BEST...although they all would have ordered their entree again for sure.!  The pork chop on my plate was perfection!  The bratwurst...well...just like I used to get in Wisconsin...oh the memories of Wisconsin.  Sorry to digress...!   The meal, the service, the entertainment...well worth the drive from North Scottsdale.  I can't wait to do it again!

Ocean Club was the 2nd leg of our progressive dinner last night (8-14-2013)  It was my dining companions birthday celebration and he had never been before.  I chose Ocean Club for our main course.  We were greeted promptly by name and seated immediately.  I had stopped by the restaurant earlier in the day to drop off a birthday card and flowers for our table.  Yes a little redundant, but I'm all about going all the way or nothing at all!  At that time I explained that we were having appetizers 1st somewhere else and moving on to another restaurant for dessert. All was well when we were seated, card and orchid in place (whew).  I ordered Swordfish for myself and the bone-in Rib Eye/Crab leg combo for my companion.  I also ordered the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, and the Sautéed Mushrooms.  Our server Lloyd was amazing, treated us as if we were his only guests.  We were not!  Once we were finished, Lloyd had our leftovers boxed and sent us on our way knowing that we had a 3rd reservation waiting.Thank you to Lloyd and Mastro's Ocean Club for making it an amazing mid-course to our evening!!!

First of all, you go to Switch because it's in a great location in the central corridor, with a great reputation.  You eat, drink, have some fun....BUT...you go back to Switch because of Tim Lott.   The Best Server In Town...!  Yes he is, makes you feel wanted, appreciated, and like a friend, not just another potential tip maker.  The food has always been terrific!  I just LOVE the Spicy Bleu Burger...yumm!  The servings are abundant, tasty and definetly worth every single penny you place down at the end of your meal.  But wait...did I almost forget the Happy Hour..yes kids...Happy Hour.  Great prices on Great Drinks and Food....!   Head to Switch and tell them I sent you and you HAVE to ask for Tim....he's the best in the business.

Well another AMAZING time at Switch...Thank You for the perfect service from Tim Lott....he is the BEST in the business! We took a new friend there last Saturday, and she had a blast...!

Well I'm impressed! I've been to Cafe Monarch in Scottsdale now 3 times since it's relaunch under the guise of Christian Lewkowicz and chef Andy Nienke, each time more pleased than the last. The menu changes daily for dinner they offer an amuse bouche, salad, main course, and a dessert as their pre-fixe offerings. With only limited seating, you must call in advance. There is nothing more magical than dinner in the candlelit courtyard garden, which is where 'my' table is located. Last night I was treated to an amazing experience that I've come to know, if not expect from this talented duo. The amuse bouche was a tartare on a slightly toasted incredibly fresh baguette with a simple piece of raw red onion. "Heaven" The salad was a deconstructed caprese with heirloom tomatoes marinated in truffle oil over some of the freshest mozzarella I've ever tasted.  Entree choices were slow braised short ribs or grilled shrimp over polenta. My dining companion chose the short ribs, and absolutely loved them.  After a taste, I totally agreed with him. They were melt in your mouth tender, and so juicy and succulent. I chose the shrimp. I know you're thinking grilled shrimp? Yes, grilled shrimp. 8 large perfectly cooked shrimp over the most tasty polenta all topped with a delightful sweet/sour reduction that tied the textures and favors together like...well, like, The Millionaire Matchmaker was involved!  Each course is perfectly sized so that you can enjoy the flavors and not be overwhelmed with the taste. I know you know what I mean. You sit there beautiful meal presented to you, a huge portion of it, and you feel obligated to eat it. Don't deny the truth we've all been there!!!  The final course of the evening was a light and creamy ice cream, house made of course, bits of chewy, gooey chocolate cake and very slightly sweetened whipped cream, all with fresh sliced strawberries.  I'm not a huge dessert person, but the portion was just right for me.  Just a couple of bites is all I typically have, and that is what it was...just the perfect final bites to a fantastic meal.  Do not forget they also prepare lunch on Thursday, Friday, and Saturdays with the same choice pre-fixe menu.   Please do yourself a huge favor and get to Cafe Monarch as soon as you can. I can not wait to go back!!!

Thank you to Check Please Arizona!   I saw Daily Dose on Check Please and just had to give it a try. Wow...the bust kept secret in Downtown Scottsdale for sure.   We arrived for lunch and actually got one of the last tables available. We were greeted warmly and our server took our drink order quickly. The menu is amazing! If there is not something on there that makes you quiver, then you must not be alive. My dining partner (out on our every Thursday lunch date) ordered the Grilled Chicken Cobb sandwich. She had pause as it's served on a Pretzel Bun. Oh girl please....hit the treadmill more in the morning! She was "blown away" loved, loved. loved her sandwich! I had the Turkey Burger. My felling is, if a restaurant is brave enough to put a Turkey Burger on their menu, they must know how to make it! They typically range from hockey pucks to bland indiscernible mystery substance. Not at the Daily Dose!!! Wow, Yumm, YAY!!!! is what my mouth was saying while devouring this burger! Such a great combination of flavors and yes, it's served on a pretzel bun as well...! The Combo Fries are the best. A combination of traditional russet potato fries and sweet potato fries. Such a great compliment to our sandwiches.   I can HIGHLY recommend The Daily Dose Old Town Bar and Grill. It's good service, GREAT food and very reasonably priced. So when you are near Scottsdale for Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner, you owe it to yourself to head, no RUN to Daily Dose.

Our return to J&G was a triumph...!   Thank you to Chris Wessling and his team, most especially, thank you to Renee and her table team for making our dining experience to wonderful.   Fabulous describes the food attentive to every need describes the service! We enjoyed a "tasting" of several appetizers. The Butternut Squash soup was AMAZING! Not heavy and full of cream as most are, and the addition of a sliver of jalapeno pepper sliced through the squash to help clean the pallet. YUMM! Followed by the Crab Cake, yes a WONDERFUL, I hesitate to say 'cake' filled with Crab, yes, Crab not bread crumbs and filler, just Crab...so delicious. Last, but not even close to least, was the Warm Beet and Goat Cheese Salad. What a great combination. Even if you are not a beet freak like me, you'll LOVE this light ever so wintry salad. MMMMM   Entrees were the Fillet Mignon done to perfection, NY Strip peppercorns ever so tasty served with Grilled Asparagus, and the famous Potato Gratin w/Comte. Wow some really good eating there! Steaks were absolutely PERFECT! The sides...well...just perfect as well.   Dessert was the Carrot Cake, a personal favorite. Yes it was better than my grandmother's. So moist, tender, and just the right size for that after dinner sweet sensation on your tongue.   All of this with a "To Die For" view of the Valley  We can't wait to go back....Renee, see you soon...!

J&G was the 3rd leg of our progressive dinner last night (8-14-2013)  It was my dining companions birthday celebration and he had never been before.  I chose J&G for our dessert course for the sweets, and the AMAZING view from the patio.  We were greeted promptly by name and seated immediately.  I had stopped by the restaurant earlier in the day to drop off a birthday card and flowers for our table.  At that time I explained that we were having appetizers 1st somewhere else and moving on to another restaurant for our main course, the ending our night of celebration here. All was well when we were seated, card and orchid in place.  Earlier in the day I had a conversation with the hostess and the manager on duty to ask the chef to prepare something special to top of our night.  I did let them know that my companion doesn't do chocolate...! Our service was attended to by the manager Ryan and our server Mercedes.  Needless to say, it was amazing!  They presented us with a table-side Cherries Jubilee.  YUMMM!  Then to top it off, the chef prepared a special birthday treat consisting of cheesecake, sauteed apples, and candied rhubarb. I had also let them know I had a gift in the trunk of my car that I wanted the valet to put on the front passenger seat to surprise my guest upon our departure.  All went off without a 2nd thought, and it was the end of a terrific experience for us both...!!!

Brio was the 1st leg of our progressive dinner last night (8-14-2013)  It was my dining companions birthday celebration and he had never been before.  I chose Brio for appetizers.  We were greeted promptly and seated.  I had stopped by the restaurant earlier in the day to drop off a birthday card and flowers for our table.  At that time I explained that we were only having app's there and moving on to another restaurant for our main course and a 3rd for dessert. All was well when we were seated, card and orchid in place (whew).  I ordered the Carpaccio and the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant for appetizers.  Wonderful was the food and service.  Until the server offered a dessert for the birthday boy.  Just an oversight, but all was well.  Thank you to Brio for making it a great start to our evening!!!

My partner and I went to TK's on our Saturday 'date' night just to check it out. Boy were we surprised! We were greeted with a warm and sincere, yes sincere, hello. Not many times you find that here in Scottsdale.   Never the less, we were seated and our server 'Maureen' came right over and wowed us for the rest of the evening.   My partner had the aforementioned Pulled Pork Sandwich. He's a person who definitely knows what he likes and dislikes. After Maureen explained all the ingredients and the way it was prepared it was a go for him. He LOVED it! I decided on the BLT...I know how pedestrian! But I felt if a BLT was on the menu, they'd probably do it right! RIGHT it was, YUMM, the best ever. Who does a BLT with Apple wood Smoked Bacon, Arugula, Amazing Fresh Tomatoes, and a FRIED EGG on top??? TK's does...and do it right for sure. It was so good I texted a friend during dinner and told her that is where we were going for lunch the following Thursday.   Maureen is the best, in fact we made a 'date' to see her with my friend for lunch on the next Thursday as I wanted to try the burger. After a discussion regarding the burger being able to be cooked extra, extra rare, yes still chilly in the middle for me! She talked to the chef and came back to say 'yes, he'll cook it ANY way you want'.   Unfortunately when my friend and I went in on Thursday, we found that Maureen had been taken off the schedule. Bummer! But we still found the service top notch and the food great. The burger not as rare as I'd like, but rare and juicy none the less.   Low and behold, the following Saturday what did I receive??? But a text message from Maureen. I'd given her my business card as I do most everyone I meet. She was apologizing for not being able to be there if I'd gone in on Thursday...Can you EVEN believe that? We exchanged a couple text's and she assured me the next time I come in to TK's she'll make sure my burger is able to revived by a veterinarian! I can't wait to hold her to that.!.!.!...   Go Try TKs Urban Tavern the next time you are ANY WHERE near The Scottsdale Quarter.

We've been a fan of Girmaldi's since moving to the Valley nearly 5 years ago.  We too were frequenters of the DC Ranch location until the Scottsdale Quarter opened up!  Sorry DC Ranch!!! The service is ALWAYS great at the Quarter, and the manager Marla is just incredible! Not only is she attentive to every single guest, but she anticipates everyones needs.  If there is a ever a problem, the management is right there to correct that and make sure that you are happy and leave satisfied and ready to return...!  So go to Grimaldi's Scottsdale Quarter and tell Marla, "Van the Realtor" sent you in to have the best pizza and service in the Valley....!

Another great meal and AMAZING service at Grimaldi's Scottsdale Quarter.  Yes the pizza is really good...but we keep returning, about 2 times a month, for the service.  Wow it just doesn't get better than this team.  Each and every server is a 'pro' at their job.  Brad, Joe, and Marla, the management team are WAY above the norm with their approach to customer service and satisfaction.  If you leave unhappy, then SHAME ON YOU for not speaking up.  There has NEVER been anything that their servers did not take care of before the management team was ever alerted to the problem.  So kudos to them for training a team of 'thinkers' not just doers...! I can not recommend Grimaldi's Scottsdale Quarter enough...go and tell them than Van and Glenn sent you...you'll forever be on the VIP list!!! Happy Holidays to all my fellow yelpers...!

WOW...another GREAT meal at Girmaldi's We tend to end up here at least once a month when the craving for pizza is upon us.  Marla (manager) ALWAYS goes above and WAY beyond to make sure our visit will keep us coming back.  This trip was no different than every other one...!  The pizza is GREAT and they always get it 'right'.   So the next time the pizza crave hits you....head to The Quarter to Grimaldi's and tell them Van sent you...See Marla and give her a GREAT BIG hug from me! Prop's to Lucas for joining the management team headed by Brad!!!

We came in during the Super Bowl and wow the staff was still on their 'A' game. Thank you to the manger on duty Marla for running the floor while having the entire crowd singing with Beyonce!!! Pizza was done to perfection just as we would expect, even though the kitchen was cranking out all those to go orders. If you haven't come to the "Quarter" for Grimaldi's pizza...get in here!!!!

A friend and I had lunch at Kitchen 56 a couple weeks ago, well I'm a BIG FAN!  I ordered the BurgerDeluxe , yes I'm a huge burger snob, at any rate, I always judge a place by how they make or will make their burgers.  I ordered it Very Extra Rare...and Yes that IS exactly how it was served.  Our server said, and I quote, "I told the chef that you indeed wanted it to only be introduced to the grill, not actually to date the grill".  How Perfect Was That???  It was just perfect and I was giddy the entire meal.  The service was not over agressive, just attentive. The balance of the meal consisted of my dining partner had the pulled pork.  She liked it a lot and would go back!  The onion marmalade on my burger was extremely note worthy.  Just the right balance of sweet without losing the onion flavor!    So I say, Go Forth and Enjoy Kitchen 56.!.!.!...

It was soooo easy to book this appointment.  I will definitely use Leo again and again! The ease of the process was just perfect.  Leo was on time, courteous, responsive, and joy to converse with.  There are a lot of car services in the Phoenix area, but none stack up to this company. He is now on speed dial!

Wow!  4 visits in the short time Searsucker has been open. Such a great addition to The Valley if The Sun!  Thank you to chef/owner Brian Malarkey for choosing Scottsdale for his adventure out of California. I've thoroughly enjoyed each and every meal served at this notable hot spot. Please do not tell anyone that it exists!  That is, if you still want a table!  It will soon be standing room only!  I had the hamburger today for lunch...A Triumph!  My dining companion said, upon taking a taste, "this burger is last meal worthy"  Go get it, you will NOT be disappointed!  Service is impeccable, atmosphere amazing, and the staff realizes there are many dining options, and do everything in their power to make you count the days until you return.  Go and tell them that the Realtor® Van Robinson sent you, they may even seat you at 'my' table!

My friend Dawn Smith and I had our much awaited, anticipated, and yes much deserved "Dessert lunch" at Searsucker today!  We'd talked about doing this for years, then, last week we saw some "Ladies who Lunch" having 'our' dessert lunch at another Scottsdale restaurant (who shall remain nameless).   So I quickly made the reservation at Open Table. I explained what we were doing while making the reservation online. Boy was I surprised when we arrived we were greeted warmly (as usual) then ushered to 'my' table. Once seated and settled, the co-conspirator Matteo Myers came table side and informed us that he and chef Andy had worked with the pastry chef to create something special just for us. Wow, did they ever succeed!  They began to serve us a 4-course Dessert Lunch. Some delights were menu favorites, some new combinations, and others were new debuts to the Searsucker offerings. Needless to say,we were blown away. Not only by the tastings, but by the impeccable service and warm, inviting atmosphere that is Searsucker!!!  Bravo to chef Brian Malarkey and his Scottsdale team!  We can't wait it have another installment next year to ring in the following new year with 'our' Dessert Lunch!!!  But first, we'll be there on New Year's Eve!!!

Well....the much anticipated #BrunchUnplugged was finally visited by me last Saturday!  It's no secret I'm a regular at Searsucker/Scottsdale, and a fan. So I was anxious to get to their new weekend brunch.  Of course I like the atmosphere, and the service, but under the guidance of Chef Aarti Sanghavi, the food was AMAZING.  Chef was introduced to me by the GM and the was the start of my brunch adventure.  I asked her what was good on the menu and she stopped me and said, "wait, what do you like? what do you not like?"  "forget the menu, I know my food and what you will like based on your tastes"  So the beginning of a great hour of food was upon me. Chef Aarti was not kidding in the least!  She began with the waffles, no not your mama's waffles, but waffles from the gods!  or at least Chef Aarti!  Scrumptious describes them! OMG the fois gras butter....really?  Delish!  She then presented me with the 'Green Eggs and Ham"  not quite what to expect, but the toasted brioche, pork belly, and poached egg were perfectly prepared!  Now the 'green' was a kitchen created chimichurri that absolutely made the dish perfect!!!!  As if that were not enough, next to the table was the 'chicken fried chicken'.  Yes a chicken breast filled with pork then deep fried and topped with Chef Arti's secret weapon gravy.  If I told you the recipe, she'd have to kill me!   I've not even touched on the bottomless Mimosa's either....! Let's not forget the live music that was energetic, soothing, but it did not interfere with the dining experience...yes LIVE MUSIC! You all owe it to yourselves to head to Scottsdale's Searsucker this weekend for their #BrunchUnplugged!!!

I'd heard mixed reviews on MSK so on our regular Friday lunches out, my companion and I decided to see for ourselves and went there yesterday. Atmosphere okay, service Outstanding, food marginal at best.  Interesting as we arrived we were 1st offered the bar to sit at, mmmmm, interesting offer, but we declined as the place was 1/3 empty, we opted for a table. As I said the service was outstanding and we could have wanted for nothing more, except better food. Kitschy but limited lunch menu, my companion said "interesting that the menu is 3/4 alcohol" so she opted for the Salmon, Apple, and Brie flatbread, and I had the burger. I always search for the perfect burger. Well this was not it. Impressive yes, muddled flavors YES.  Huge bun, green chilies, cheddar cheese, large juicy patty with no flavor and a grilled onion made up the offering. The flat bread was beautiful but so salt laden all my friend did is drink water the rest if the day to not dry up from the inside out. I'd possibly recommend MSK for cocktails after work, but for a meal, I'll not be back. We'd had such an AMAZING lunch last week at Searsucker in Fashion Square (fir less $'s) which made our trip to MSK seem so insignificant and not worth the calories. Hopefully something can be done to 'right the ship' at MSK, as DC Ranch Marketplace is ripe for another restaurant to compliment the offerings there.  So don't say I didn't warn you!

I'd made reservations for a birthday dinner for my partner and myself for 7-28-2014.  Earlier in the day I dropped off flowers and card and asked for them to be on the table when we arrived.  Well...we arrived and NO Flowers and NO Card.  I spoke with the Manager and he said "oh you want those now? We didn't know what you wanted us to do with them"  I understand miscommunication, but in front of the dining party to give excuses and accusations was  unprofessional.  Yes they immediately brought them out and apologized profusely and gave us 2 $10.00 gift cards. Really?  That won't even cover cocktails for 2 people. We felt that was kind of insulting . I'd been to Paul Martin's before and had good service and the food is always good.  Just when there was something out of the ordinary, they completely dropped the ball. Food was good, the service a bit rushed at first until we asked to take our time.  Very Disappointed!

Time for me to update my previous review.  Yes we had a horrible experience last year at Paul Martin's, the general manager did contact me and comp'd a meal for me and a guest. That experience was great, but then again there were ready and on guard for us.   We returned last Saturday without prior notice. After arriving early, we sat at the bar for cocktails while waiting for our table to be ready. Drinks were great, the bartender engaging, servers were fantastic and stopping by to say hello as we waited. Once our table was ready we headed off to dinner. Our server, Heather English was amazing! We ordered appetizers and additional drinks. While waiting for those fresh bread was brought to the table and The manager stop by to say hello to see if our experience was going well. Yes dinner was spectacular!  But, the service was attentive without her hovering or ever making us feel like we were just 'another' table.  Wonderful experience.   In closing, I highly recommend Paul Martin's as it seems as though the bugs have all been worked out...!  In fact, I'm heading there next Tuesday for lunch with colleagues.
