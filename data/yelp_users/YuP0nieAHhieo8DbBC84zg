Our go-to place for date night. Upon entering you're greeted immediately by the friendly and courteous staff.  You'll find that there's something on the menu for everyone. My personal favorite is the classic Cobb Salad. The ingredients are always fresh, and always consistent! A huge plus in my book :) Delicious comfort food, tasty drinks, and a great location. You can't go wrong with Wally's.

From the moment I dropped my car off until the moment I picked it up, my experience was awesome. My service consultant, Doug was very courteous and helpful. He got me a great deal on some replacement parts for my car, and had my car back to me within a day. Very professional and respectful. I found my new dealership for service!

I walked into this Ulta location looking for some of my fav hair products. I couldn't find what I was looking for so I opted to try something new. The salon manager asked if I knew how to apply and style it. I said no, but I'm sure I can figure it out. She then offered to give me a blow out so I could see how to get the best results from the product. I was thrilled!  The end product was amazing, and I was so grateful that she took the time to give such great customer service. I am a continuing customer here, and I urge anyone to drop in and hopefully receive the same experience I did.

Being a first timer here, we were impressed with the size and atmosphere of the restaraunt. Not your typical sushi joint. There was a separate bar area with multiple TV's showing the Monday night football game, and even some TV's in the dining area. It was busy which is always a good sign! Overall our sushi was pretty good. Your typical rolls were on the menu, along with some specialty rolls. Prices were decent too.  The best part of the night was their happy hour, 25 cent tap beers. Can't beat that!! I'm not sure what HH specials they run other nights, but Monday nights are definitely a winner with us.

When we venture to The Valley Ho we're never disappointed. We joined Chef Chuck Wiley for the Monday night Chef's Table. The atmosphere was fun as usual, and the staff went above and beyond to make guests really enjoy themselves.  The menu was delicious, and the wines that were paired really complimented every course.  ZuZu is always consistent, and for that we'll always be returning guests!

All around great place. Love when you can leave a restaurant with zero complaints. Doesn't happen too often!

Went in for a mani/pedi. Didn't have to wait long, which is always a plus.  The establishment was very clean and organized.  Staff was efficient, polite, and humorous. Both mani and pedi turned out great, and very reasonably priced.  Will definitely be back.

Very unimpressed with this establishment on many levels. My experience is too long and drawn out for me to explain. I'll simply state that no one seems to know what's going on, there's a lot of employees standing around not willing/wanting to help, and most of them act like you're a nuisance instead of a paying customer.  I've heard other bad reviews, but I'm one to make an opinion based on my own experience. This is one I should have skipped.

If you love Mexican, this could be some of the best you'll have. Not only will you be dining in a beautiful resort atmosphere, you'll also receive some of the best service around. Very impressed with the service, cuisine, and overall dining experience.

I was asked to be part of a commercial shoot for the Food Network, so last minute I decided to make an apt here so I wouldn't have to deal with my own hair.  They got me in right away and knew exactly what I wanted. They were very friendly, efficient, and professional. I would definitely recommend this salon to anyone who is looking for a great blow out for any occasion.

A great neighborhood restaurant if you're looking for a casual atmosphere with a delicious menu.  We stopped in for a happy hour drink and decided to try some of the apps. The bartender made some great recommendations for us, and we weren't let down.  Would also like to mention that Dave, the bartender was very accommodating!  He surprised me with a cocktail that he overheard me talking about to my husband. It was a great surprise and definitely made a good impression on us. We'll def be going back for an actual lunch or dinner :)

My husband and I couldn't be happier to have finally found a great restaurant in our area! A convenient location off the 51 on Shea Blvd, makes this place easy and fast to access from anywhere.  We initially went in for an after dinner cocktail, but soon realized we wanted to try everything we saw coming out of the kitchen. We ordered the Bacon Board, and couldn't have been happier with the results!  Both the food and cocktail menu is fun with a twist on the regular american cuisines and beverages.  If you're looking for a casual, fun, and cozy dining experience this is the place to check out.

Love this place. Baylee is awesome, and always does exactly what I want. It's hard to find a good stylist, and I definitely found one.

Slow moving employees that don't listen to the order taken. We ordered 2 subs and payed $24. RIDICULOUS. When you swipe your card to pay, it's prompts a tip line. Seriously? Your getting paid an hourly wage to do you job, and they want a tip for the bad service they provided?? No thank you, I'll go back to Subway.

One of the best stay-cations yet.  Spacious rooms with all the amenities.  Not to mention a great view of the pool.  Our room service was delicious and served in a timely manner.  Our day at the pool was exceptional as well.  Hugo was our server and did a fantastic job.  We stopped in Prado before the fireworks and enjoyed a creative cocktail made by Kyle. Very refreshing! An overall great experience, and a great way to spend our holiday weekend.

Not impressed. Although we got seated right away which was rare for a Sunday, service wasn't great. I immediately recognized it was quite warm when we walked in.  Disappointing when it's July in AZ and people are looking to escape the heat.   Ordered the Brioche French Toast, came out way undercooked. Very rarely do I send items back, but this was not edible. Not to mention the fear of consuming raw eggs when you're pregnant isn't very comforting...  They offered to remake it and I kindly declined but they did it anyway and it arrived when my family was done with their meals.   Having been in the food and bev business for years, it's common courtesy to remove an item from a customers check when they are clearly unhappy with it. Not the case here. Guess they need the money more than returning customers.

A fun diner atmosphere with friendly efficient staff.  I recommend my favorites, the french toast with the meditera baked house brioche with carmelized bananas and the Redeemer.  When I saw the most epic looking Bloody being delivered to another table, I had to order it. Can't pass up a double pattie slider hanging off a cocktail!  Not to mention it came with salami, cheese curds, olives, etc. It was a meal in itself. YUM!

Best place in town for a bloody.  Always looking for someone who can replicate a good midwestern bloody mary, and this is definitely the place!  Always helps when the service is exceptional, makes the whole experience more memorable and exactly the reason I am a returning customer.  This place is exactly what Tempe needed.

Finally a new, fun, place to grab a beer! PV really needed this. A great atmosphere for the whole family. A large variety of local brews and a tasty menu to pair it with. Well done O.H.S.O. :)
