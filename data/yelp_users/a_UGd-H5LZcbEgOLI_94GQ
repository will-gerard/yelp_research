Dr Bracken is by far the most hard working, compassionate and understanding veterinarian out there. I was recommended to him by not 1 but THREE separate friends after my dog was hit by a car. My dog, Maeby, is a rescue dog and the light of my life. Seeing her get hit by a car was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life followed by a very stressful few months. I initially rushed her to an Emergency Clinic in Glendale who was available at night. I was terrified by their service. $400 dollars later I took her home with pain medication, some antibiotics and a 3 day internal bleeding watch. The next day I woke up to pooling blood coming from her undercarriage and once she finally let's me take a look I notice a HUGE gash that had completely been overlooked at least 4-5 inches on the underside of her tail. I took her back to find out her tail was broken and needed to be amputated. So now I'm on my second visit and the vet that comes out says that "these things happen" and "can easily be overlooked" Excuse me? She's a 13 pound dog. For that price and for being hit by a car I don't think I'm out of left field in expecting you look at the entire dog.  Ultimately he tells me her tail needs to be amputated and it would cost $1400 but did not want to "steal my thunder"..this was a problem as I didn't have that kind of money up front and had already spent a few hundred. I pay for the x rays of the tail they overlooked, the sutures and for additional pain medication-- about another 300 dollars.   I was hysterical. My friends recommended getting a second opinion and this is when my god send, Dr Bracken came into play. He agreed to see Maeby the next morning- somehow he was able to make out what I was saying through my high intensity gurgle cries. She stayed intermittently with Dr Bracken and staff for a month getting her tail sutures checked and rebandaged; checking her hemmoraging and cuts and bumps. We were going twice a week which was extremely overwhelming in it's own. Some days I just had to get to work and they would watch her the whole day for me. Dr Bracken understood my financial concern and the love (understatement) I have for my dog. They worked with me and never made me feel anything less than welcome and at home regardless of my hysterics every single visit.   The whole staff has a deep love for animals and understands how much yours means to you. They will give you nothing but straight answers, 100% of their attention and fantastic service. I think half of them are also human psychologists.   Maeby ended up losing most of her tail through the process but Dr  Bracken never lost sight of my concerns for her and would call me personally with check ups. She is now back to her normal puppy antics and happy as ever wagging her little nub every minute of the day.   We will come here for life and I constantly rave about this place. You won't find a better vet anywhere in Phoenix.

I finally made it to Lo-Lo's. It's been on my AZ bucket list for 2 years. To say I was excited would be an understatement. I was dancing in anticipation. It wasn't very busy which seemed like a plus. We were seated immediately. Seemed like another plus. We waited about 50 minutes for our food- soul crushing. As we watched people who were seated long after us be served my rumbling tummy began to wonder where the F my food was. Our waitress didn't come back that entire time to check on us so I couldn't really update my stomach on the sitch. On a time restraint and irritated my adorable boyfriend (I have one now) flagged down an employee and ask them to check on our order as basically everyone else in the restaurant but us was eating. At this point our waitress finally surfaced for the first time in 45 minutes. We asked her how everyone who was seated after us was already eating and she told us TO ASK THE KITCHEN. Are you kidding me?! Also, they messed up my boyfriend's order and didn't give him all his food but we couldn't tell her because she vanishes like.. I don't know, anything that vanishes quickly and for long periods of time that doesn't want to return. We asked for the manager at this point and told him what the waitress said/ about the wait/ the food and he also blamed the kitchen. I feel really bad for the inanimate kitchen at this point. It gets blamed for everything. I don't think the kitchen is to blame when people who come in well after us get their food before us but I also haven't really worked in the industry so I might be wrong. Strong sense says she simply didn't put our food in and doesn't know how to take responsibility. The manager didn't apologize for the waitress' attitude or take anything off the bill for us waiting nearly an hour and messing up our order or for their service. He did offer a free dessert, however, it was 10 in the morning and we were already over their bologna. My suggestion- Take some ownership! This was our first time in your establishment. You guys messed up. You let us sit there for 50 minutes after we placed our order watching people who sat down after us eating without ever checking in on us. We had to flag you down. Your waitress told us to go in the back AND ASK THE KITCHEN WHAT WAS TAKING SO LONG. Listen, if I knew I could freely go in the kitchen I would have made a snack because I was hungry as all get out.   The  foodie in me and die hard downtownian is deeply disappointed and will likely never go back or recommend.   I gave it two stars because the chicken and waffles were alright.. the restaurant was clean. I got a refill on my coffee in my cute ass Lolo's mug from someone who was not my rude waitress.. although since I'm here writing this I might as well say that the mug had a large chip on the rim some could say is a liability. The hot sauce was good. I am a big hot sauce girl. My water came with a lemon which could be construed as classy and didn't taste like gross AZ tap and one waitress had cute hair and smiled at me..so that was nice.

I love this place. The staff is super helpful, especially the one that looks like Jack White's half brother, Jacob. Great selection, too

One of the cutest date spots in downtown. I always get good service and their patio is adorable. I like to come and share a salad, pizza and bottle of red wine. I really can't recommend more than that since that's all I have gotten in the years I've been coming!

Well this place has everything I could ask for.. I would say it is the most "authentic" Thai I have found in Arizona.  When I order "Thai hot"  at other restaurants I am left disappointed. Here, my eyes water. That's what I'm talking about! They have quick service and it is family run. The owner's daughters are both vegetarian so she is quick to accommodate and also recommend dishes you might not even see on the menu. She is always there and will come and greet you every time you visit. My personal favorite here is the massaman curry.. The best in town without a doubt. They also serve amazing thom yum soup.. And it literally comes out on fire.. Well, there is a circle of fire around the soup bowl. Semantics.   This place has recently undergone a facelift. They used to have very over the top dining furniture which limited seating. They have since streamlined and added new booths. There is also a large flat screen usually featuring sports and they now offer wifi.   The last thing I really appreciate about this place is that they are open late!  Hands down my go to place for Thai. I tell everyone and bring everyone then repeat.

This gym is run extremely poorly. The movie studio or "cinema" is down for maintenance a lot, there are rarely early morning classes, and when issues arise there is no one there to help. Yesterday I showered after my workout and came out to find one single and very broken hair dryer. I called the front desk and was told they are aware of the issue and that the GM would be buying some for Monday morning. There was no signage, no one informed me at the front desk, and I was only made aware of the situation once my hair was sopping wet with no chance to rush home before work. The working manager Stacy showed up 10 minutes later with 2 more broken hair dryers asking if I was the one looking for a hair dryer (duh-doy) One didn't work if you moved it and the other only worked by plugging it in (on/ off switch broken) and only on low/cold (power level/ heat broken) I was very upset (and now late for work) and scheduled an appointment with her to speak to the gm Monday morning at 8 am when he arrived. I get here and check in to speak with him just to find out he won't be in until 9. I was then informed I could email him.. No offer to have him call me in regards to our missed appointment. Head to the ladies locker room after my workout.. Still no hair dryers. Good thing I learned my lesson and brought my own this time! Then I am venting to a friend that also uses the facility and find out he is able to use the same locker room, is able to attend classes, and gets his parking validated for $20 per month.. I pay $40 and was told you cannot have parking validated, attend classes, or use the locker rooms without the platinum membership. I have noticed the classes are often full and everyone seems to take advantage of the services I pay more for.. Simply because they don't check/ it is poorly run/ monitored. Either pay the $20 and use everything freely or for $40 a month do yourself a favor and go to Mountainside across the street at Chase Field for $38... Follow up: the manager didn't even apologize for missing our meeting and instead emailed me a very condescending email I am happily going to post for you :)  A few things I did enjoy during my year + with this gym: It has a great panoramic view of the city aka I get to watch people drinking and enjoying themselves at Copper Blues and Blue Hound while I slave away on the cycling machine.. The breakfast club is outside for post work out smoothies or coffee, and lastly, they offer razors, hairspray, and deodorant in the locker rooms, but as you can see in the GM's email you should not hold your breath for them to keep their "courtesy" items in stock just because you are paying for an "elite" gym..Say what? That's exactly what I expect, bro.

The only reason this place received 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are no substitutions. As someone that doesn't prefer to eat meat but loves eggs Benedict I was sad to hear they don't make the meals on site thus can't manipulate them.   But their coffee is amazing and the food is delicious!

I literally dream of the enchilada dinner plate. Their spice game is on point, the owner, Drew, is absolutely the best and the bartender, Hector, is always friendly and awesome. Last time he recommended I try their sangria/margarita combo.. All I can say is yes, please and can I have another.   This place will not disappoint!

The food is pretty good. I'm not vegan and no longer vegetarian but live very close. The service seems to take a pretty long time regardless if anyone else is in there with you or not. One time there was only two other tables and we waited an hour for our food (there was only two of us.) The waitress, however was very polite and apologized. I still give it 3 stars because the food is always good even though it takes longer than I think it should and the girls are always very friendly.   I love the decor. It's so kitchy and fun. All the mugs are different and they have a jackalope hanging over the entry way. I also just love the story of Braggs in general and love to support local business.

won us over the first girls' brunch we had there. I am not even a pancake person but you better believe I get a pancake every single time I go. Don't forget to ask what the pancake of the day is!   They recently revamped their menu.. I know it was recent because I went a week ago and it happened in between then and Saturday morning. They added a ton of delicious stuff. I tried the caprese eggs benedict a little worried I made a terrible decision. Alas, the food came out and I did not make a terrible decision. The egg was cooked perfectly. Execution: flawless. Devour time: 4 min.   The only thing I hate is the wait time but I guess that is a good thing..for them. Always packed. They just implemented a new system to let you know your table is ready though; they text you which is great.. You can go walk around the shops while you wait.  Don't forget to try a beermosa.

I love the downtown vig. They took over Local Breeze if you were downtown before it was "cool" and they did a great job. On Monday's they do a $5 cheeseburger special that you just can't beat. Pretty decent beer selection. They usually have more draft selections inside if you ask too. Staff is always friendly.

Yum!!!! Great service. Went on a Friday for date night. Got seated right away. Very affordable. Had the kimchi chicken and waffle buns, the goat cheese and beet dumplings and the ahi tuna chips with one of the noodle dishes and the banana foster donuts. Wow! Super delicious.  We both said we will definitely become regulars. NoM nom nom
