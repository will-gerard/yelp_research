Had the "house made" corned beef hash n eggs. Tastes like canned with some grilled onions. Our waitress was not nice at all. She didnt seem to want to be bothered with our order or grabbing us refills or anything. Not much of a wait, but you would think they were slammed.  Plenty of better places to go around here. Will not go back.

I had smelled all the great smokey flavors coming from the place right across the parking lot a, few times, so I figured I'd take my wife and son for a nice dinner.  My wife like the onion covered steak ok.  I ordered the sirloin with lobster.  The steak was ordered med rare, and it was like rubber, with hardly any flavor.  The "lobster" was WAAAAAY over cooked and was about the size of a crawdad tail. Lame spot, waitress was horribly unfriendly, and the girl that brought our food wouldnt shut up long enough for me to start eating hntil my food was cold, or maybe it was cold when it got there

just use bountiful baskets or go to Safeway....same prices (if not cheaper).  boxed greens has better prices.  if you can make it down to their warehouse on Fridays they sell everything you can fit in a box for $20!!!  Quality has gone so far down over the last year there, that I will NEVER use them or recommend them to anyone.  Boxes are reused and have foot prints on them.  GROSS!  Ask them if any of them have food handlers cards!!!!!!!!!!

My wife's car broke down outside the shop at the gas station next door.  Her oil light came on and it blew the motor after about 30 seconds of driving!   I put oil in the motor to see if that would fix it, but NOPE, the oil all drained out on the floor.  Went next door to the shop to talk to Ken to see what what was up,  and he let us know what had happened.  The last place I got her oil changed had either not tightened the oil filter or used the wrong one.  Anyway, I had to deal with the other company (yes, they paid for it)  so that took about a week.  When the motor finally arrived, It was installed and fully running in less than a week!!!!!!!  Simply amazing.  I own a fleet of vans for work and brought one in for the brake light being on.  Keep in mind, I had problems with the brakes for over a year on this.  They fixed it all up and for under $100!!!!!!!!  I will be back again and again.  Thank you Ken
