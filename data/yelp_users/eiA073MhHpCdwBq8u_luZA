Finally came to this cafe after hearing about it from my friends for so long~  Rolls were a highlight as the Negiyama Roll was a well crafted mix of green onion/yellow tail and the Ebi Roll was full of tempura goodness.   The three noodle dishes we tried were pretty good in comparison to place like mido and sushi ken but not on the five star level of eateries in Little Tokyo in LA and Japantown in SF.  Only con was that it was freezing in our corner of the restaurant but getting a hot soup can easily remedy that -  can't wait to come back and try the other things here.  Good prices, excellent food! (Also appreciate the diversity of their menu ^^)

Macaroni salad and Chicken Katsu good BBQ chicken not so good  It's a bit weird paying 9 bucks for rice, chicken, macaroni, and steamed lettuce when other Hawaiian places offer multiple sides gratis with your meal. BBQ chicken was a bland rubbery mess that the Katsu sauce couldn't help. (Teriyaki tastes like straight syrup)  Visit the much better Hawaiian options in Phoenix! "cough Paradise cough"

Returning from a summer spent in the very food conscious and bountiful San Francisco was quite a downer as I felt I was in a desert literally. (+figuratively) I was saddened by the loss of my Epicurean lifestyle in SF and sold my soul to the likes of Safeway and Jimmy Johns.  Once I emerged from my stupor I'm beginning to find that Phoenix actually does have quite the amazing finds if you search hard enough. Best of Europe Deli is one of those and it blew me away as this gem in the corner of a strip mall hides in its shelves what its name entails.  Some locals inside recommended the luncheon meats and the cashier broadened upon those recommendations. She also doled out hearty samples of great polish cheese and some spicy capicola. As she did she explained that she was the daughter of the owners and that most of the meats are made in house or brought in from local establishments. Her expert opinion was also derived on a lifetime of experience on Polish food.   I counted my loot at home  Great polish spicy mustard 3/4 lb cheese  lb of capicola, jam A fruit drink called Kubus (quite tasty) Redcurrent Jam And a half loaf of bread A goulash mix!~  All for under $20 The fact that none of these products contained preservatives or weird chemicals was great and that the money was used to support a great local business makes you feel good. (As it usually should, I'm looking at you Safeway and Walmart)  This experience made the 30 min drive to northern Phoenix quite worth it and I feel lucky to have found this place via yelp and that places like this exist in a mostly barren commercialized landscape.  I also learned polish food is more subtle and rich but quite nice! Highly recommended~

A real hole in the wall joint in a gravel lot - What this place lacks in aesthetics it makes up in price and quality.   The price is pretty comparable to Chipotle and Filibertos and they have a pretty decent amount of choices on their menu. Stick to anything with Carne Asada!  The hours are a bit weird too 6:30am-2pm

-Exquisite Sushi-  You know a sushi place is going to be legit when they serve items like maguro (bluefin), sake (salmon), and otoro but Sushi Hiro goes beyond the scope of what most sushi places in Phoenix serve by offering an array of hard to find goodies. Items like Hirame Engawa (Halibut Muscle), Uni (Sea Urchin), and Amberjack are all on offer here. More importantly is that they treat their dishes right as each nigiri comes with the appropriate brush of glaze like the Anago with its sweet soy based glaze.   The all Japanese chef team here have noticeable especially when you watch their knifework and sushi crafting. No sloppy cuts of fish or clumpy rice here and you can clearly see their talent and deftness with their tools.  Their nigiri and sashimi is excellent but I was pleased to see that they do the traditional fusion dishes that Chinese and Korean sushi owned joints excel at. Caterpillar roll came in at $13 and was topped with loads of avocado and unagi. More impressive was how thinly the chef was able to slice the avocado onto the roll. It seems minor but it changed the texture of the dish and made the avocados one of the best I've had topped on a roll.  Overall, I think Sushi Hiro is one of if not the best sushi places in Phoenix and able to compete with the more established sushi destinations on the West Coast. You simply can't find quality, value, and menu diversity elsewhere in Phoenix.   Having Asahi on Draft is icing on the cake.~

Place is still excellent three years later.  2 item combos for under 8 bucks and I've never had a bad wing at this location. (Also has amazing ranch)  I see people kvetching that the pizza isn't as amazing or as NY authentic as the one at Grimaldi's.... Puzzles me why your comparing a eat-in coal fired pizza in Scottsdale with a more casual slice place like Venezias. The two serve completely different categories in my opinion. A more fair comparison would be the nearby Slice's or Sal's pizza which Venezia's blows away.  A lunchtime/gameday staple

when it's 2:30 in america and the last bastions of late night solice abandon you where do you go? Well you go to Sonic's  And late night the chili cheese tots and value menu is on point  So much so you barely  remember the crusaders of the dark who serve your meals with a friendly hello and delivery of your high carb goodness  DAYUM IS IT GOOD at 2:30~

This is one place that desperately needs the trademark Korean restaurant table beepers.   Ignored for a good 40 minutes in a half empty restaurant. Received drinks after 45  Good company made it bearable  Servers were disinterested  They follow the 80/20 rule in serving 80% of service to 20% of the tables.  Didn't replace grill racks Didn't replace banchan until we asked 20 min later Same for rice  Not even a hi all dinner service Invisible man service style  Lotsa hairs in potato salad Waiter just shrugged and said yea   (At this point it was just like grinding it out for the meal to end, the latino waiter who seemed like the only person in the restaurant really trying to serve people seemed pretty sad too by this discovery.)  Waited for bill...another 20 min Asked for a split check, lotsa sighs  Just disappointing when I came here last year with Koreans we got the polar opposite in terms of treatment. At least the food wasn't as underwhelming as the service.   It's sorta sad people are rating this place so high esp with the price premium they charge...Have they never been to So-Cal Korean bbq, or heck even Chodang? And sushi at Takamatsu is pretty OP (as in overpriced) too since other people mentioned high great of a deal the sushi here was.   Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.   **Came back a second time a week later and the service was just as bad. No service really and my friend had to yell and wave to get scissors after waiting 20 min. Charging 18% gratuity to serve ourselves and not get refills of banchan makes me cry a little inside.

I've always been eerie of going to this spot due to its vicinity to ASU but my recent trips here haven't been all too bad-  The ASU roll in particular was a fav - nigiri was alright for AZ  Happy Hour prices look great but on second look are around the same ceiling as House Modern's which is better imo  Our waiter also was a superstar! (Dr. in Training you know who you are~)

I got a pretty decent haircut and with the first time discount 18 dollars for a haircut plus tip for a cut is not too shabby  I had Ryca as my stylist and then get touched up by the owner after she finished  *Update Eh 3 weeks into my haircut the deficiencies are starting to show Back and sides are not layered evenly and over a pretty average men's cut  It's disappointing I can get consistent good haircuts in Korea for 10-20 bucks but paying that much in America will be hit or miss 90% of the time

Waltzing into Fujiya I noticed a Japanese bakery right next door. Oh Joy!  After pillaging Fujiya of some much needed pantry staples I walked into Arai and picked up the Curry Bun, Yogurt Mousse, and the UFO. The Mousse and the UFO we're just A-ok but......  THE CURRY BUN WAS THE BOMB - And full of carrots. Seriously folks if you like Japanese curry and a nice pillowy airy bun this culinary piece can be yours for $1.75.  I agree with a lot of John C.'s points - food is pretty quality but pales in comparison to other bakeries along the West Coast. But we're in the middle of the desert so I'll round up. (I also will be back to try Asian Birthday Fruit Cake and Strawberry Slice)

They have a decent selection of pantry staples but I'm giving this place 5 stars for having really well made bento and for carrying the Japanese version of the Choco Taco, the Morinaga Monaka. (Which is way better)  For the bento I had the tempura eel bowl and the nori bento. All rice bowls seem to have more food then you think and eating just one $4 bowl left me pretty full in combination with a curry bun from Arai next door. I didn't think cold fried food could be good but these bento bowls have turned me into a fast convert. Can't wait to try the sushi next.  I'll be back for sure whenever I want some well made bentos that range from a very sensible $4-$8.  Hopefully one day this place will grow into a Nijiya sized market for Phoenix.

- Updating my review for the ramen -  And wow is the ramen good! I wasn't expecting much but for the paltry sum of $6 (If my memory serves me correctly) I got a bowl of Miso Ramen served a slice of pork, ginger, seaweed, and an egg. Excellent rich broth, perfectly chewy noodles, all served up with the condiments listed above made it a pretty awesome dish. I also drank all the umami filled broth without shame. ^^ I'd say the ramen here is as good as Cherry Blossom's downtown at a much cheaper price  Even though it was pretty early on Saturday the parking lot was full and the ramen sold out 30 min after I got there with my friend. Though... early for me is 11:00 am lol.   You won't regret waking up early for noodles!

Would have liked to give this place a better rating but after their service and prices egh the rating is going to stay at two.  Food takes forever to arrive, bread not refilled nor water. 18 dollars + 6 dollars for meat for my pasta dish. Was quite good but the portion was a pittance. 11 dollar fries did not arrive either.   Maybe the place is understaffed but I've had less wait times for food and service in Europe which is usually a very leisurely pace but compared to Caffe Boa was downright prompt.  All in all a lack luster experience.

Even though their rates can be a tad high and I've gone without electricity in the past at least SRP will help you out with some great support that will solve your issue in less then 5 min. This can't be said about other services like ISP's (*cough cox/centurylink cough*)

Firestone was my go to auto shop for 2 years but I've gotten sick of their upselling and pressure tactics.  The last straw came when they wouldn't rotate the Michelin 100,000 tires I had with lifetime wheel balancing and rotating. Apparently there was "too little tread" and they advised me to replace all 4 tires asap. (While also dropping that they had a promotion for tires and steering me towards some $400 ones)  I took my car to Hon-Man and they told me that my tires had some typical cracking from the AZ heat but was otherwise fine.    I used to go for their $14.99 oil change and service check but I'd rather spend $29.99 at Hon-Man to get an accurate diagnosis. This isn't an isolated incident either, everytime I've come to a Firestone they print out a listing of "urgent" repairs your car needs.  If you love Jiffy Lube scare tactics your gonna love the treatment you get at Firestone who seem to only look to pad their monthly billing reports. If you want an honest reliable mechanic that actually passes on the savings to the end customer go find a nice shop like the Honda servicing Hon-Man.

Keeping up with my belief that the more sketchy a place is the better, Chino Bandido delivered.   I had the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice and what was $6 of food tasted like $10+. The fried rice had a mushroom presence as well ^^  I also appreciated the salsa It appealed to my spicy side~  Like Jeff said below the food is surprisingly not oily and msg-laden.  Only in America would I find Tex-Mex and American Chinese food in such a happy marriage.  (Beats Panda Express)

An eccentric area that is a grocery, deli, pizzeria, and restaurant combined into one place. It reminded of the smaller neighborhood markets in Seattle or SF. Having eaten at the nearby Ingo's Tasty Food I had high hopes for the pizza here and my takeout Mushroom Party didn't disappoint. Loaded with mushrooms, garlic, and sweet onions it was a white pizza that had an abundance of veggies and flavor without being too heavy. One minor thing to nitpick was the crust of the pizza which was a tad too chewy.  My friend, who ordered the Gladiator, wasn't a big of fan of his pizza as the meat pizza with sausages and pepperoni looked a bit undertopped. The sausage while good was the only noticeable topping on the pizza.  I definitely want to come back and check out the other offerings that La Grande Orange serves up. They also have an airport location so I'm looking to try out the sandwiches and breakfast items there as well.   As for the pizza it satisfied my cravings but I probably won't rush back due to the fact that its a bit pricey and wasn't blown away. ($32 for 2 pies) It's a solid product but can't compete to the artisan pizza that places like Pizetta 211 turns out in the outer boroughs of SF.

Glorified panda express  With that generalization aside I was willing to give ol PF Changs another try when they served me a steamed shanghai shrimp dish that was devoid of flavor  Thinking less flavor meant a healthier meal I alas was given a shocking reminder of how this place sodium bombs their dishes when I read the nutritional info   'tear

Have you ever had the communal bread during service?  Yea that's what Friday night deliveries of Hungry Howie's pizza crusts taste like.  Dry, crumby, doughy.  It was a pleasant reminder of the desert sand Phoenix was built on but sadly not one that reflects good pizza taste.  Don't forgot the dried on cheese glue on top!  Yum!  You couldn't pay me 5 dollars to eat this but sadly my inebriated comrades seem to love its pink pizza cases and their friendly 45 min service!  On a plus side this pizza does have the magical effect of bringing you down to wherever depths of euphoria you were in to the stark reality with just 1 slice   :O  One last crack....  This is one pizza Digiornio's can beat in their "fake pizza delivery ads" blegh

If you have a childish love for hating humanity and enjoy activities like jerking a rusty butter knife across your throat cox is the ISP for you.  Not only does their "24/7" only work from 9-5 m-f they barely could care less if they solve the problem. I had to go to the better business bureau to finally  solve a hanging laggy internet problem. Even the BBB couldn't get a response for about 3 months.   When it did go through I got finally a glimmer of hope in a great technician named John as he solved most of my internet problems regarding bad cables.  John solved my problems temporarily but it's clear that this stellar Lieutenant on the front line cannot solve the inadequacies and leaks that stem from poor system design and just a lackluster UX. (if they even care about the end user at all)  However no technician no matter his professionalism and great candor can stop Cox's sh**** customer service, or the fact that our internet goes to sh** when high traffic hours come on.  Cox is passable when you don't have issues. When one starts however, you can clearly see the cracks in their structure. My identity was stolen and a payment on my internet bill bounced due to Wells Fargo closing my account down to prevent further theft. I explained this to their CSR reps and still I have oodles of strange and weird charges on my bill. I mean why is their 2 charges for credit card and e-check denials on top of credit adjustment above it? Isn't that a little redundant to fix a charge and then charge me back for the charge I was credited back? There's a mountain of () and #'s that would make a license CPA want to scream.  Even better is their automated voice system when you call in that makes you go through loopholes only to make sure to remind you at the end of their maze that they are closed. 24 hours customer service my brownie butt.  Shouldn't 1 call fix this relatively small problem instead of having to call back and check if "Cox" is ready for you?   Oh yea I bought a new modem and router thanks to their whizes at their in store locations which is like putting a band-aid on a gaping wound. You can improve your end but the likelihood that Cox holds up theirs is doubtful and will remain so until the USA changes legislation that makes ISP standard what the Asians in Korea, Japan, hell even China have today.  I want to talk to the system engineers and upper management of cox? What is the business vision of cox? To spread the corporate love of a company that survives by a cartel business structure and not one of true democracy? The CEO of Cox should really contemplate where his ship is going and look deep down if he wants to be the caretaker of a customer service/business model that most Cash-Advance Loan Sharks wouldn't touch  It's digusting that the only other option in my neighborhood is cox or shaky looking century link dsl connection.      So yeah if you have 99 problems and your downright darius about becoming a centurion go ahead and sign Cox up as your ISP provider.

This place has been my mainstay while going to ASU for 3 years and I guess I've forgotten to review them for awhile~  Their selection of Korean food is much better then Lee Lees or Mekong and since they feed from the Asiana chain in California they seem to refresh inventory pretty often. They even have K-bbq cuts of meat so you don't have to do any additional work.  I'm a fan ^^  Pros: Cheap veggies, good sales, great Korean selection  Now if they only had cheap Hite and Soju but for Arizona this place does the job  and best of all there expanding! (The lady up front told me they are looking to add more banchan stations and kitchen goods yay)  -Also agree on what Karen said, this place is like the Korean/Japanese/Chinese Markets in SF

These guys are top class in terms of service  Showed me everything that was going on in my car and took the trouble to explain every detail to me. After having an accident and some car trouble this year it took a lot of that worry away and it was great to have a clear explanation on what was going on in my Honda. As an added plus they also glued on my Honda emblem that was getting loose!  They even have a cute little dog who wanders around while you wait ^^  Honest Mechanics, Fair Prices - Highly recommend these Honda Experts

These guys are great every time and much better then the money hounds at Firestone. After getting misdiagnosed once again at Firestone I went to Hon-Man to see if Firestone was once again cooking the bull. It turns out I did not need a 4 tire change like Firestone was pressuring me to do.  On another incident my alternator was failing and when they offered to replace it they said that since the alternator was close to the serpentine belt they could replace that for just the part cost. (Something Firestone wanted $199 for)  They keep it simple, don't give you bullsh**, and have great prices.

My god so good mmmmmphsddj  The holy grail of sweet meat au jus coupled with mushrooms and onions transcended me into an experience akin to a stoner and a late night Taco Bell run~   I planned on saving half for later but that failed... Also eating and driving with this beast was a challenge as the juices dripped everywhere, BUT THATS OK CUZ I LOVE YOU MR. JUICE (Most cheesesteak places have dry beef :'( )  And with the summer buy one get half off deal its even better, for the price of subway I can get a Philly cheese x deux  Staff was bickering and apologized but I barely noticed, with a sandwich this good you could burn down my house for all I care.  Just a warning - you might have to change yo pants after eating here  *Almost as good as Jin's Grill in SD

One of the best places to get a tea/slush in the Phoenix Area. (BombBoba in Peoria comes close)  - Pluses -  Wide menu selection Quality flavors  Good value Cute packaging  Every visit has been quick and easy with prices rarely going over $4.25 a drink. They also didn't charge me extra for using a credit card! Quality is a high point as none of the drinks here have the watery powdery taste I've experienced at some of the Tempe boba places.   If you feeling adventurous you can try the popular Avocado that comes off as a sweet creamy treat with a buttery avocado aftertaste. (My go-to's are the Honeydew/Tea offerings) The only qualm I have about this place is that they don't have the honey filled pearls that are popular in Cali. :( lol    If your craving high quality boba that rivals places in SoCal you can't go wrong with this establishment.

Way betta then thee Hodori 5 miles away.  They have good banchan (sides) as well as overall goodness with the usual Sundubu and Jaeyuk Bokkeum. (Pork Stir Fry)  I'd say Cafe Ga-Hyang and Chodang are the 2 best Korean restaurants in K-Restaurant Deprived Phoenix. ~ (Sadly the two best also demand a bit of a premium in terms of price point esp. compared to LA )

It felt like highway robbery and after being $100 lighter I was finally in my house. Breaking a window pane is $20 and is something that in retrospect seems like a better idea.   What a way to get fleeced for a 10 second screwdriver smash.  *Also if your smart don't pay cash so you can just charge back these scammers on your credit card, these guys charge from $60-$500 depending on how much they can hustle you  - high pressure tactics - ask you to pay cash or go to atm - overquote as soon as they arrive after promising $34.95 and up initially - didn't even ask for ID or proof I lived there - said the simple qwikset lock was an "advanced" lock which normally would cost $189 and up to open  ISRAELI MAFIA RUN SCAM AVOID  Avoid these guys ....they're on NBC Dateline as a scam for a reason. They pretend to be a local locksmith company when in actuality they're a nation wide scam group with contractors. I mean just look at their generic website it shows that they exist in Tempe but if you look through their locations they have over 100 cities listed.  Check the first 20 ad links for any locksmith related keyword on google- chances are you'll be referred to one of these affiliated sites that this one company creates.

Pretty clean for a chinese buffet and so many selections :D  Lots of selections to make and they have a make your own mongolian bbq style stir fry place.  Sushi and Sashimi is really good (Though I had to keep sniping for the tuna rolls they always get taken first)  I liked the veggies at this place better then meats as the veggies always seemed tasty and fresh but the meats sometimes tasted chewy.  The stink berry soup is really good too (litchi/gingko soup?)   Overall a good place and well worth it.  Oh yeah people also fight over the king crab legs..... I dunno why I guess some people have to get the crabs money worth.

4 years later still a solid spot for a lunch buffet.  They raised their prices a bit from the $8.95 I remember to around $10.50 for lunch but it's still an incredible value. Where else can you find a great mix of Korean, Japanese, and Chinese food all under one roof.  Standouts are - Wokked Mushrooms - Maki Handrolls - BBQ Area  I wouldn't come here for the $18 crab leg dinner free for all but it is a go-to spot for lunch~

Man happy birthday to me I came for the $10 off birthday deal that Joe's offers and came away with much more  First of the location is around some fields/orchards and something you don't see too often in Arizona. Ordering was quick and they have electronic telly things that remind you when your foods ready  The seared ahi tuna came with some of the best rings I've had and I got a strawberry milkshake as well. The ahi was mammoth with almost a lb of pure tuna. The panko breaded rings were on point. The shake imo was just ok, but it doesn't hurt that it's made with better ingredients then other shakes elsewhere. (Sonic's I'm lookin at you)  Overall the scenery, peeps, and food is worth the trip. (Big fan of the ordering system as well)

I've been to Mido twice now trying the All-you-can-eat sushi option as well as the normal a la carte offerings. After trying the AYCE option I think its a decent but pricey option. For $28 including tip you get wave after wave of a wide variety of sushi/nigiri/sashimi options they have as well as hot tea. If you choose this route I recommend the Mido roll and the Dragon rolls as they were ones that stood out from the generic other rolls we tried. Spicy jalapeno yellowtail was disappointing as the yellowtail was a mix of mayo, sriracha, and lackluster fish. The nigiri here was disappointing as well as the ones here are an example of quantity over quality. Do note that you won't be getting some of the better stuff they have when you order from the AYCE model.   A la carte I had a better experience as I chose the soba sushi dinner combo. The spicy tuna donburi and soba that I received for around $18 was massive as well as tasty with each entree coming out in one of those giant bowls they use for Pho or Bibimbap. My dining compatriots got the ramen and sushi/unagi and their bowls were just as big. (Though looking at the online menu I can't seem to find this amazing combo of food)  Sorta funny that some previous reviewers said this place is an all-japanese restaurant..... Place is full Korean owned lol (Which is why you'll see more fusion rolls and not some of the Japanese staples like the negiyama roll)  So yeah decent food that will fill you up and one of the few places in Phoenix that will do AYCE sushi.

Seafood in the desert - Actually pretty good! Before my spring break drive back I stopped at Mariscos Sinaloa.  Some reviewers aren't fans of the fluorescent lights and the jukebox but they didn't detract from my experience. Originally I was in a rush to get going and thought eating here would be a quick in and out. When I saw the free chips arrive though I settled in for sit-down restaurant mode.   I got the: Shrimp Ceviche Tostada Shrimp Taco Fish Taco  The tostada part was pretty soggy after a mound of ceviche was on top of it but it didn't matter due to those *Free* chips. One portion of ceviche was literally like a half lb of seafood.  The shrimp and fish tacos were pretty good as well though I was eating them while driving in the Phx traffic jam. The creamy chipotle and hot salsa that come with the tacos are winners as well.   Now if you crave fish tacos you don't have to drive the 350+ miles to San Diego.

The Taiwanese dishes here are quite good.....   I don't know what people are expecting when they go to a Taiwanese place and order Mongolian Beef/Orange Chicken/Kung Pao chicken and then immediately compare it to Panda Express  That aside their scallion pancake with egg was scrumptious and their prices here are just what a college student needs.   I prefer this place to A.C.E. too  downsides~ boba not good as boba house, some dishes are off, service is very hands off asian style..... but you go to a place for what its good for and TFE is well worth the effort

The $7.99 lunch special is actually quite a deal coming with teriyaki beef, chicken, meat pancake and 4 sides. Could easily be a meal for 2. And they don't actually charge on a lot of the stuff that they say they do if you ask nicely. Like to go boxes!  So I'm bumping them up a star for their value and spam musubi's. (Just know that the service can differ from great to scary depending on who's at the cashier lol)

Pho Tai here was A-ok  Was happy to see all the condiments around as well as fish sauce. (Sriracha was in a generic plastic bottle instead of its namesake package)  A strong force in Pho-land in Pho-enix would like to see some more noodles/meat to bump it up to the level of SF Pho places.

Great location, gorgeous rooms Was very grateful to be in such a place.  Rooms came with a fully stocked kitchen, two bedrooms, and two nice flat screens, and a bathroom with jacuzzi and were spotless.  The concierge and the staff were quite helpful and the surrounding area and malls have everything you need in a 5-10 min car ride radius. The business center was also quite helpful for printing my grand statistics homework (a travesty that my break was spent sorting that out but never mind about that).  Overall a great place to spend break.   Oh yeah free fast wi-fi (always an underrated perk)

Wow, wished I found this place earlier before I flushed all my M and G at the decidedly sub par fast food chains in the Memorial Union. This place is a diamond in the rough especially for students like me subsiding mostly on Subway.  My seared Ahi salad was interesting and well executed and had elements of beets, turnips, and quinoa in a romaine salad.  Its a tad pricey but I'm willing to pay for quality when I get free drinks and a restaurant style setting once in a while. (Especially if I'm using Maroon and Gold) The ambiance is also 10x better then what you see at the other on campus restaurants.  For people complaining about service try Hassy, PV, or even the esteemed Barrett dining halls =/ The service here is golden and lightning fast compared to that.  That said returning as a non-student in the future is close to nil as I hope to have found better options but for now this is truly an ASU treasure and one I will frequent.

Was convinced once again by peers to try this place.  Oliveo's delivers pretty mediocre/flavorless Greek for a "bargain"  price. Bargain being around five dollars for anything on the menu.   The taste.... It tastes like 99¢    Recap from my visits:   Bad greasy falafel (prompted me to review the falafel was truly terrible) Tasteless Gyros Sides that stayed....well on the side  Go to Haji Baba nearby instead... or anywhere else for that matter.  I guess location keeps em in business~

Ah CEO Phillip Chang is quite the genius  He is the man who engineered this great contraption of funneling people in n out (which by the way is next to it) through its green doors filled with microbial energy  And yea all Yogurtlands seem equally awesome and when I use the frequent 4oz free coupons I get the yogurts for practically nothing?  My Hunting Record for this location $1.44 $0.26 $0.73 $.1.29  BUT PHIL I WANT MORE YOGURT I WANNA SEE YOGURTLAND BE THE NEXT STARBUCKS BABY

After visiting this place twice in 2 days I gotta say my opinion of this place did a complete 360. First impression of this place wasn't too hot as they were just opening up from winter break. Because of this I didn't get to experience their array of baked goods or their breakfast.   I ordered a single espresso and the cafe au lait. The espresso was pretty much a double size-wise and packed a wallop as I was buzzin for a good part of the day. Cafe au lait was milky to the point teetering on excessive to some people but I loved it. While the product was fine day 1 the ambiance was pretty dead especially compared to the Starbucks 1 block down campus.  Normally I don't visit places twice (even places I like lol) but because of a photo assignment I came back the next day to take some photos of the food offerings and boy was I glad that I did. They had their breakfast up and running and the loaded potatoes I got were a healthy mess of goodness with spinach, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and peppers. Their white peach blossom tea was excellent and I appreciated that it was a loose leaf version made by the China Mist company in Scottsdale.   The staff here is friendly but pretty quiet matching the ambiance of the place. Looking online it looks like they have a pretty extensive menu so I hope to see that coming to this location soon.   Also make sure to show your ID I completely forgot to show my Sun Card both times and missed out on the discount. Guess I don't look like a student anymore :(  tldr; Quiet, Local, Organic, Pretty good value

A pretty good good Korean Bunshik Jib (Everything Restaurants) Banchan is 7-8 dishes, food is above average and the atmosphere is pretty spot on~  A caveat is that it is a tad pricey especially when compared to   and other restaurants like this in LA.   The two ladies that helped me on my visits don't shy away from suggestions and are pretty helpful!

Rating this place a bit late but was quite nice to live at Alanza Place. The 3 floor townhouses are amazing and a pretty unique feature when it comes to renting a place with spacious floor plans and a 2 car garage. Their pool and exercise rooms are well maintained and having a separate floor with a business center to print stuff out on was a plus. Neighbors are friendly and keep to themselves and mostly seem to be young families or couples.  Front office treatment can range from cold to awesome depending on who you get but generally solved problems pretty quickly. Rosa and Matt always took care of any problems right away and were awesome whenever I had questions. Only caveat I had here living in 2014-2015 was that the online payment portal was awful and wouldn't post the correct amount or verify that a payment went through. (Which meant finding out your rent the old fashioned way and having to write checks every time)  Was charged a king's ransom in moving out charges ($220 for kitchen and carpet cleaning?) but living here was an overall very positive experience.

Fast service and close location to ASU makes this location pretty popular. Parking is a little tricky but as long as you avoid coming here during lunch when school is in session you should be good to go.  Building wise it's a bit on the smaller side compared to other Chipotle's and the line will snake through the restaurant when they get busy. Haven't had a badly made burrito here yet~

The epitome of chain mall sushi really. While over-breaded tempura, dried out flavorless sushi, and other questionable examples of Japanese/Korean cuisine may appeal to some it didn't do it for me. The service and location is nice but can't really mask the quality of the food. The J-Pop cocktail I had was erring on the watery side as well.  Half price happy hour softened the blow but at the end of the day your getting ok, pricey nosh in a nice setting.

Honeydew snow was great and so were the gyoza but...........  This is my third time here in 5 years and to call this ramen is simply an injustice to Japanese Culture and Cuisine. Underwhelming noodles, broth that isn't ramen form in anyway, and toppings that ironically remained on the bottom of the bowl throughout the meal - unsavory and untouched.   It's like if I took a piece of bread, covered it in ketchup, and put a Kraft american single on top and sold it as pizza in Korea.  (Though knowing Koreans I think its already been done lol)  That said avoid the ramen and this place is actually pretty great! (Cool ambiance and interior as well) Time for a name change?

Was pretty great.  The hotdog with grilled veggies and an assortment of veggies were on point after a night of adventure.

Haven't had Indian food in a while but the buffet is legit  Buffet is well stocked with around 15 items and they have hot tea and mango lhassi on the side. Buffet is split into three parts of Non-Veggie, Vegetarian, and Random. (I think it says something else but I categorized this as random in my head)  Solid lunch buffet in the area all for around $11 including tip  *Also had like 10 pieces of Naan ~ nyam nyam

Who knew tasteless and Mediterranean went together.  I apparently didn't   Instead of the dreamy hummus and usually great kebabs I expected the meal was quite spartan.   I mean you can make food healthy but you don't have to kill every ounce of flavor to get there. The dressing couldn't salvage the flavorless wreck. It's sterile atmosphere and boring food makes me wonder if its clientale is ge  My dining companions made quick work of their food but I warrant that more to the 3 hour long Cloud Atlas movie was just endeavored in.  So yeah if you like crudites are happen to be a rabbit come to Zoes!

They serve Horchata on a stick!   Well its named Arroz con Leche but it brings the milky cinnamon goodness a horchata does for 3 bucks. Great little bits of rice and cinnamon too.  A bit pricey but I think the quality and taste reflects that.

Yay decent teriyaki near campus that I like better then the nearby Paradise Hawaiian   Got the Katsu Bento for 6.95 and friend got the Teriyaki Chicken sans bento for a dollar less. Big portions  - Cheap - Cool interior   So far I'm a fan of this restaurant row of Grilled Ave and Gluttons  (Oh yea its Korean owned! And you can draw on the walls like they do at The Street Boba)

Man is it hard to find good sushi in AZ  Almost as hard as finding good Mexican x_x   House Modern does fusion sushi (AKA lots of spicy sauce and mango dressing) and nigiri up to my standards and will be a place I will frequent in Mesa for my maguro needs.  Definitely not the best when compared to Cali sushi joints but is leagues better then the other places I have eaten in Arizona. Plus the fact that they have a lot of choices on the menu bodes to good things, though they didn't have hirame in stock when I visited.  ;_;   (They also have a 20% deal on rolls and sushi right now)

Burger is bloody good. $6 Happy Hour Pitchers too!  Been half-jokingly trying to get my friends to eat here but they kept passing because of the overflowing parking lot and the name. BUT AT LAST I HAVE ARRIVED  BBQ Burger - Perfectly medium rare with lots of juice. 2 fat slabs of bacon and veggies on a great bun. You can definitely taste the quality of the ingredients here - Yes please.  I wanted to get a glass of grapefruit Hefeweizen but found out during Happy Hour a pitcher is just $1 more. (Who could pass that up @_@)  One of the best burgers in the Camelback area and definitely a notch above the ones at the Attic.

Quiet location tucked away in front of a Goodwill. I always stop by here whenever I need a snack in between transit. The location isnt as busy as others which explains the small staff and wait times but I haven't had a problem here.   Another plus? Its convenient location right next to the ASU Poly Campus.

At first I was a bit hesitant about eating here. The name for some reason reminded me of deer horn and what kind of food does a "Deer Garden" serve anyways?  Once inside though I discovered that DGS is actually a pretty popular chain serving up big bowls of noodles and clay pot dishes. It's confusing but enticing menu lets you choose your own adventure with a variety of sides, broth, and noodles you pick from. I went with the Szechuan spicy soup, big noodles, brisket, luncheon meat (spam), and brisket.   The result was........ SPICY and really good. Think Neoguri but in a hearty fish broth and way better noodles. It was hard to put down but when I finally did I had enough left for a meal the next day. I also tried some of my friends Hong Kong won ton soup but it paled compared to my garlicky spicy bowl. The only downside to the meal was the stringy brisket which carried the added sin of being a bit flavorless.   I'd come back to Deer Garden just for this tear-causing broth but the other dishes on the menu look quite appetizing as well. One of the better chains out there, though on their website all their other chains seem to be in Canada.  - What Kay said below is pretty much what the service is like - pretty non-existent. (Some  asian restaurants have those wireless call bells but here you have to wave em down ^^")

Pretty cool stand at the Street Eats Festival and though I didn't get anything my friends got what I believe to be a banna bread and vanilla cupcake.  I had a nibble of two cupcakes my friend got and came away pretty impressed with my small sample. Cupcakes were moist not dry and they definitely had good cinnamon-y notes throughout.   Only caveat was that at the festival they were priced at $4 each and like much of the food at the festival a tad overpriced.

The epitome of average  Avoid the mall food please and go somewhere better like Grilled Ave or Tokyo House. I ordered a very subpar spicy tuna roll with dried out fish mixed with sriracha and rolled pretty sloppily. What the beef bowl lacked in flavor it made up in chewiness and portion. (Great for people who want jaw workouts!)  Anywho if you want better food and are willing to drive about 5 min away theres better places right on the Lightrail/Tempe Campus.

This place should seriously get more coverage.  Maybe its because its a euro style salon complex with about 25 mini salons? Either way I'm surprised that this place and Lea Lee my stylist was kept a secret for so long.  A friend referred me to Lea and she got me a pretty awesome cut for $15 (+$5 tip)  I'm very very happy to finally have found that someone in the vicinity of Phoenix can cut asian hair.  Talking with Lea apparently there's a lot of Korean and Chinese hair stylists in the area but when I looked them up they didn't seem to be on Yelp or Google :'(  Guess I can start a trend and find these peeps

What sounded like a great deal of 3 clubs for the price of 1 turned out to be pretty much a deal too good to be true. First the 3 clubs were more like lounges and pretty small ones at that. Made us wait 20min so that we had to pay the after 12pm price.... Agree with what the other reviewers had to say the $20 deal sounded great but ended up being a pretty big letdown.  Cons -S*** Lounge/Club -Fun bouncers -Not honoring the drinks deal -Charging $30 instead of $20  Also noticed that they were holding people in line unless they wanted the $$$ bottle service until the after 12 price increase kicked in. If you would like to see some more colorful descriptions of this sham of a promotion there's many a example on trip adviser.   Don't get the open bar wristbands pretty much a big ripoff when you could visit many of the better Real Clubs nearby~

Walking down ASU's farmers market I spotted this stand selling Hummus!  Looking for a change from Stacy's Pita chips I bought a tub of garlic hummus and garlic pita chips (twice the garlic power)  PRETTY DAYUM GOOD  And for about a dollar more per item compared to supermarket generics this is one area I'm willing to splurge on.

I used to think snow wasn't as good as boba, then I visited Snoh during the Matsuri festival.   Mango boba snow with condensed milk was almost airy in texture and was something I've never had before - price is a bit steep but highly recommended if your looking for something then your boba fix

My first foray into Scandinavian food and Beaver's Choice   They recently moved and after a 4 month wait they reopened to a newly remodeled place. The new place looks pretty great, I never visited the old location beyond peering at it from the outside but this place is a clear upgrade based on the aesthetics alone.   Food:  The poutine was ok, not amazing but decent. Wish they used better fries. (Hand cut would be better)  I had the Laxpudding and friend had the Kottbuller (Swedish Meatballs).  If your not a fan of dill and sour notes you might find the food here agreeable to your palate but it was nice contrast to my usual eatings.  The best part of the food here in my opinion was the three sides that accompany your meal. I had pickled beets, broccoli, and the house cole slaw. Get the beets! The beets are good.  Foods on the pricey side but finding Swedish food is hard in Arizona beyond an Ikea. Also talking with the fam as we waited for our takeout was great fun.   I'm guessing the poor reviews on service below can be attributed to people coming in during peak hours because my experience was quite different. (Also they make everything to order and look like their still adjusting to the size of their new restaurant from our conversation)

As I sit here on an average day in Eugene I'm reviewing all the middling sort of restaurants that are sitting here on my to-review backlog.   Pak is an interesting hole in the wall place that's a little hard to locate. Mango Lassi here is excellent and raised no qualms from me here. But the mixed large grill platter was an underwhelming array of 3 varieties of chicken and beef kebab. (To be fair I should have ordered a curry or any of the more tantalizing dishes on the menu but I went with a generic plate with a group of friends)  All four kinds of kebab were pretty meh and each bite was more of a slog than a race for the next one. It tasted more like a Costco meal then a fine tuned dish with savory, tender, tasty elements. Aka alotta quantity and not a lot of quality.

Got my fav honeydew boba here~  You have to make the hard decision of snow vs slush at Bomboba and I went with snow since it sounded cooler. (Not to sure of the difference though, more snowy?)  A big plus of this place imo though is the flavor pearls - an oddity in AZ but pretty common in Cali  Thumbs up - now make one in Tempe!

Grabbed a cone here after my mouth was on fire from eating at the Angry Crab Shack during the Southwest Cajun Festival. The ice cream tubs looked pretty generic but the two scoops I got on a cone for $6 was a pretty good deal for a festival. Butter Pecan was great blend of rich nutty flavor and quickly doused the heat while the Cookies & Cream was a bit more bland with a soft vanilla flavor throughout.   Overall, glad that this place was here during my 5-alarm crisis but I'd come back here for its frozen yogurt which seems to be their specialty. One last thing to note is their name. Are they Tart & Toppings or The Neighborhood Treatery? I guess it'll be a mystery to me for now.

The first time I came here the experience was very meh with a BBQ pork sandwich (Banh Mi Xa Xiu) that was in reality just a gamy porky mess with no char. It may also been because I waited 30 min to eat it but the sandwiches bread didn't really hold up to standards as well.  I normally wouldn't have came back but they sent out these great coupons that lured me back to try their other sandwiches. This time I vowed not to go cheap and paid the .25 cents more for the Grilled Pork Banh Mi. (Thit Nuong) This one was way better! Bread was fresh and crunchy, pork was juicy and with nice grill marks it was a winner.   If pork isn't too your liking you can also get the grilled beef as these two tasted the best out of the three I tried. It tastes a little bit like Korean bbq sandwich in a way with nice greens and that butter mayo pate~

Been pretty busy lately so when a friend hit me up to go for sandwiches I took the 10 min drive from Tempe to Ike's in Mesa  A sandwich shop with NorCal Dutch Crunch - OH BABY  Sandwiches are pretty pricey but just having that elusive Dutch Crunch bread makes this sandwich worth it. Having the option to create anything you want here is an added plus. I don't remember what I ordered but it came with mozzarella sticks and roast beef and I was pleased.  Sorta sad after talking with the staff that they were supposed to have a location on Mill but it fell through :'( I guess the fine people of Mesa can enjoy this sandwich shop while we settle for the like's of Jimmy John's  Now I can finally say my favorite line from Super Smash Brother's Brawl ~ We Like Ike ('s)  *Edit looks like they are having a location on Mill after all~ Yay!

Thought this was a sushi restaurant though I should have known better based off the name. (Gogi means meat in Korean)  Our party of three got the 3 Soondubu stews and the Bibimbap. (Friend's Pork Bulgogi never arrived but it was waived from the final check) I thoroughly enjoyed my Beef Soondubu as it was a boiling hearty bowl of goodness filled with a whole egg and tofu. I never received gochujang (spicy red pepper paste) for my bibimbap but I had fun dipping the rice into the soup so I ended up not missing it that much. Sadly I left my to-go box of the bibimbap at the nearby Boba House so I didn't really get to experience the dish in it's fullest form.  Prices here are similar to the other Korean restaurants in the area with $10-$15 prices for most dishes. Their banchan selection is average with five sides offered.  Service is a little slow as they seem to be understaffed during the lunch rush and you may be forced to flag them down with some waving to get some attention.   Overall I like this place way better then Hodori and on par with Chodang and the other  Korean restaurants in Glendale. A good addition to the Lee Lee's neighborhood and I'm sure they'll work out their consistency issues.

Yeeee boi Always drink a bit more then I plan when I come here ~  They have a variety of cocktail soju, soju based cocktails, and they now have food! Place can get a bit pricey but its worth it to see 2ne1 on the wall.  K-pop, modern decor, soju - You know i'm a fan  (One day ill be sober enough to bring my camera here)

Uninspired Tex Mex food served up by an apathetic staff. None of the ingredients here are fresh and it tastes very much like the corporate Sysco food that cafeterias dish out. Probably wouldn't have finished if it wasn't for the copious amounts of hot sauce I applied.   If a Taco Bell and Del Taco burrito taste around the same for about half the price you know there's a problem. There's much much better options at Sky Harbor  *Tip - There's a 4 star rated Los Taquitos  off the airport that came up in my search that made me think this place was good but make sure you get the airport location in your search or your going to be pretty disappointed.

Great crust, 2 minute cook time, and unlimited toppings. The only caveat here is that if you load up on too many toppings the top of the pizza may not brown in time with the bottom.   Overall though this is a great lunch spot and if you nab their $7 pizza and drink combo a relatively good deal.

Feels like a ski lodge, they bump an interesting blend of electro/dance music like the lodges too. It makes sense since Snooze is a mostly Colorado based breakfast/brunch chain and the interior matches it's laid back attitude with simple orange decked decor.   Free coffee in the lobby is pretty good but the paid stuff is even better. I can't quite explain the coffee taste but it's a strong bold blend with a fruity and floral aftertaste.  The mocha is delicious! I sipped through it pretty fast but at least there's a lot of whipped cream to eat when your done.   Food-wise they do a great job as well with pretty huge portions. The spuds deluxe was a giant serving of potatoes with scallions and cheese. I chose the barbacoa and mushrooms which were great but wish the dish came with eggs instead of having to add them on for $2 extra dollars. The B.E.A.T. was a solid rendition of a BLT as well with egg and avocado ($1.75 extra) and a nice little cake of hash browns on the side.  Great addition to the neighborhood with Postino's and I look forward to eating here more. The price at both joints though will be limiting my trips sadly :'(  Drinks looked interesting, especially the Bloody Mary variations! Though I'm a little hesitant to get my drank on in the morning.

Found this food truck at the Street Eats Festival at the Salt River Fields and out of all the options I tried I like Press the best. Other trucks didn't have a reduced price offering after visitors paid $12 to get in but Press delivered in this category with appetizers priced in the $1-$3 range and half sandwich/salad combos for $6.  The arugula side salad was quite plain dressed with just a tad of balsamic vinegar but they went nicely inside the Italian panini which came with salami, pepperoni, mortadella, and provolone. The website says that the Italian comes with a red pepper pesto but my sandwich appeared to come without this spread. Nonetheless it toasted, simple, and well executed.   At $6 one of the few places that delivered good food and value at the festival.

This newly built facility is as good as it gets for self-storage.  I used the nearby Public Storage on McDowell last year and the difference between that place and Uncle Bob's is like Heaven and Earth.   Positives: All-indoor Air conditioned Fast front desk Huge Fast Elevators  Plenty of Dollies  This contrasts with the other storage places in the area like Uhaul and Public Storage where you sweat it out outdoors with slow push-button lifts. You also don't have to fight over dollies as they have plenty of them scattered throughout the property. One caveat is that they are about $5-$10 higher a month then the other options in the area but I'll gladly pay more for the benefits stated above.  Like other reviewers have stated manager Matt is awesome and made moving in a breeze. The service here is better then some hotels.  Great facility, great staff!

Tasty tasty stuff served up here in this corner Greek restaurant. It's a bit tucked away in a non-descript strip mall but the Chicken Souvlaki served up here definitely made the trip worth it.  The Souvlaki ($6.79) was great! Big juicy bites of chicken charred perfectly and served up with onions, tomatoes, tzatziki, lettuce, on a warm pita. Friend's thought his gyro was good but thought it had too much sauce and shouldn't have placed it on top. (He's been too many kebab places though so can be nitpicky) Alas, I took no photos because I ate my wrap too fast. (Sad Face)   Definitely a place to check out when you want something good and fast.

The Japanese here is good, the Korean is better. (Prob because it is Korean owned) I usually like to pop in here quickly for a bite and watch a game on the flat-screens.  After discovering the Hwe Dup Bap here (mixed Korean sushi rice) I don't get anything else. It's a bit pricey at $16 but the value is there with a ton of fish mixed with rice, veggies, and chogochujang (Red Pepper Paste w/ Vinegar). It doesn't look pretty but it sure is a tasty bowl of goodness.  The Japanese side of the menu is decent but I found it not as strong in comparison to the Korean offerings. Sushi is average for the price though the nigiri slices here are quite phat. I couldn't put my finger on it but the sushi rice here falls flat compared to other places and the nigiri comes sans wasabi. Gyoza here is cooked perfectly and worth a try in its perfectly fried glory. Tempura didn't fare as well as the veggies were heavily breaded taking away from the shrimp.  It's pricey but the location and quality Korean keeps me coming back. (7 visits and counting!) Love the ambiance and music.  All in all, Gangnam is a great addition to the other Korean places near campus like Paradise Hawaiian and Grilled Ave.

Korean dive bar right in the middle of Mesa! Portions are quite large.  Things to get:   Kkanpunggi  (Spicy Garlic Fried Chicken) - popcorn chicken in a spicy tangy sauce, excellent  Padak  (Green Onion Fried Chicken) - same fried chicken in a delicious sweet and tangy mustard sauce. This one had a bit less mustard but it came with a lot of green onion strands which I love - friends not so much.  Not so great:   Korean Fried Wings  - breading was ultra thick and weighed down the chicken. Eating this was a slog and I actually didn't finish this even when I brought it home. (Never Happens)   We also got Chum Churum Peach soju which was pretty tasty stuff. Tasted like a Bellini and packed a punch at 14%.  Still can't believe this place exists in the middle of Mesa in a random strip mall. Just having the K-pop and divey Korean bar feel does it for me but for people expecting Seoul or LA quality fried chicken they may come away disappointed.   Friend said Cafe Agit was better a couple years ago but as a first time visitor in 2016 I loved it.
