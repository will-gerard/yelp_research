First time here and it was sub par at best.  Little sushi restaurant in a strip mall. Service was a little slow and the Food came out slower. There were about 5-6 tables occupied along with 3 diners at the sushi bar. We ordered a few rolls, one being the Phoenix roll which was baked and tasted horrid of mayonnaise and imitation crab. The other rolls were edible and average. There was 1 sushi chef and he was extremely slow. We received 1 roll every 10-15 minutes it seemed. I saw manager in the back kitchen standing around who did not check on his Sushi chef but once. So it was a different environment than I'm used too meaning professionally ran restaurants with friendly staff and a sense of urgency are my choice.

Awesome Breakfast!!! Had the Meat Lovers skillet and it was so hearty and was a huge portion of pork lovin plus the chicken fried steak! Very picky about my hash browns but theses hash browns were perfect, not overly salty or to dark, but perfectly balanced. Server was attentive and the restaurant was nice and clean. Definitely coming back!!!

Went for happy hour and was impressed with the sushi and to top it off all the rolls were half off. Big plus! Friendly staff as well.

First time dining here and I noticed first, place was full...Good Sign! Our server was friendly and courteous. Couldn't beat the reverse happy hour prices from 8 to close. Ordered a few rolls off of that menu. Ordered a couple more off of regular menu. Favorite was the "First Love" roll. Very tasty with good acidity. We'll be back to try more rolls! Oh Sopporro's were $2, a plus!!
