I don't want to waste too much time on this place, but since I mentioned it in another review I feel obligated to say a few words.  This is the worst Burger King in the world so far, and I have been to some bad ones. Everything manages to have a bitter taste that I just cannot explain. I seem to remember a time when BK did not nuke every single thing, but those days are a fading memory. Bitter taste plus microwaved texture equals food that hogs would turn up a nose at. Still the place is usually crowded.   The one redeeming quality is the staff. I've worked a block away for two and a half years and a lot of the crew have worked there that whole time. They're pretty friendly considering what they get paid. Still, the food is just so terrible I cannot bring myself to give it even two stars.

I just cannot understand why this place is so highly rated. Could it be that people have never experienced barbeque outside of Arizona, so they have no basis of comparison? But even that cannot be true. We have Joe's in Gilbert, and even Famous Dave's is pretty darn good.   I work a block from this location, so I have been there at least a dozen times. While not great, it is something different once in awhile, so I put in an appearance now and then. The food is not bad, per se, it is just not that good. The prices, on the other hand, are far too high for what you get. $11 gets you a "large sandwich" which is not very large, an order of fries, and a soda--RC brands. For a couple of bucks more I could get a combo platter at Famous Daves.   Service is all business. I don't think I have ever seen a smile in the place. But it is fast. The place is usually dirty, but I am usually there right around lunch, so it might be better other times.   Just not impressed at all. But...it beats the Burger King down the street which is the worst BK in Christendom. But that is another review.

Man, we were really looking forward to this. After watching the Sichuan episode of Bizarre Foods the other day I realized that, while I have had Sichuan dishes before, I had never had hot pot. We usually go to the Chinese Cultural Center for Golden Buddha and had never tried Szechwan Palace.  So, the four of us headed over there with eager anticipation. There were warning signs right away. Wife: "I'd like hot tea please." Waiter: "we're out of cups!" They were out of other stuff too. Still, we found plenty to order. Food started coming out pretty fast, one dish at a time, over a period of about a half an hour. If you want all of your food at once you would hate this, but we were sharing everything anyway, so that part did not bother me.   But lots of other stuff did bother me. Dan Dan Noodles were good. Everything else was bland...including the hot pot. They forgot our spicy dumplings. The waiter disappeared for about twenty minutes at a time. Our table was placed in such a way that people were constantly asking me to move my chair. I could go on. Just a bad customer service experience and average food. Very, very disappointing,

I stopped by George and Dragon for lunch a couple of days ago. It was the first time I had been in the place for many years. Unfortunately, I was at work so I could not drink alcohol, but the food was great. I had fish and chips and my co-worker had bangers and mash. The fish was some of the best I've had, and the person with me enjoyed his food as well. The prices were decent, and the service was great.   Even though I was not drinking this time, I could not help but notice the excellent selection of draft beers. I really wish I was closer so I could have some booze at this place. Alas, I live in Ahwatukee.   For those of you who are closer and enjoy the pub atmosphere, George and Dragon is highly recommended, though I imagine the place is a zoo when there's a big soccer match. The last time I was here I was not impressed, and had not been back since. But this last visit was wonderful. Either something changed, or I just caught them on a bad day last time.

I love Padron Anniversary Series cigars. The problem is, they are REALLY expensive. Recently I read about some "Padron Alternatives" online. These are cigars that are made to feel, look and taste as close to the real things as possible. Deciding to order some online I suddenly realized as I was entering the payment information that these were going to be shipping from here in the Valley. Not only that, one of their locations was right down the street from my office.  So yesterday, instead of going to lunch, I headed down to Cigar Warehouse to try a couple of these fake Padrons. Now the cigars themselves were not Padrons by any means. But they were pretty good for the price, good enough that I bought a bundle. But that's not the point of this review.   The store was not huge, but a decent size. The whole place is essentially one big walk-in humidor. Their selection is not as good as someplace like Tinder Box in Ahwatukee, but decent nonetheless. They have a lot of big brands, as well as their own "alternatives" to some of the more expensive premiums which I mentioned above.  They also have a little smoking lounge with over-stuffed leather couches. That was nice. It was good to be able to have some water, enjoy my purchase, and not have to pay a large annual membership for the privilege.   But what I really enjoyed about the place was the conversation. The guy working there was pleasant to talk to, and some of the customers also joined in the conversation. One thing, maybe the only thing, I miss about living in Indiana is having a lot of people I can just talk to--conversation that goes beyond sports or cars or the weather. This place was a taste of that.   I'll be back often.

After experiencing the wonder that is Carolina's West, I decided to check out the original location.   To say the place is rough looking would be a major understatement. It is an old building in a marginal area. The floor in the place looks very garage-like, only with water and spilled soda puddling on the floor instead of motor oil. It all adds to the overall charm of the place.   The food, of course, is top notch. As good or better than their West Valley location. Service is quick, and sometimes even friendly, though not uniformly. It was an experience I hope to repeat soon. Just great, basic, Mexican food.

Amazing! This is cigar and pipe paradise. The selection is incredible: humidors, pipes and pipe tobacco, ashtrays, lighters and so many cigars it boggles the mind. Their walk-in humidor is the largest I have ever seen, easily the size of some entire stores.   I've been in twice now. The first time the service was adequate, but the guy running the show was talking to some other customers so I could not judge the friendliness. Tonight was great. They took lots of time to answer my questions, show me their merchandise and just generally chit chat. Others have already mentioned the great smoking lounge. Unfortunately, membership costs $600 a year, which  is a little out of my price range right now.   I did not see the barware that another reviewer mentioned. I asked and they said they had never carried anything like that, so I wonder if she was thinking of their other location. Anyway, I agree with her that this is definitely a "guy place."

After reading the reviews here we decided to check out Bell' Italia last night.   As others have mentioned, its a tiny, family run place, maybe eight or ten tables total. They had the Sinatra going on the sound system, and the NY-LA game on the TV's, but the sound was turned all the way down on the game, which was good. The Sinatra was more pleasant to listen to than baseball announcers. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza (most of it for home leftovers), lobster ravioli, and ziti with meatballs. My wife had the sangria, which we all tasted.   The food was all good. The prices were a little high compared to Vincent's, which is where we usually get Italian, but very much in line with any of the big chains. The pizza had a fairly thin crust, and was very good. The pastas, according to my wife and niece, were good. The sangria was real nice also. I'm more of a scotch and beer person and never acquired a taste for wine or wine products, so this is high praise coming from me.   What made this place stand out was the service. Very rarely do you find a place as friendly as this. They made a real effort to help us keep our two-year old happy, bringing out some dough with a tiny little rolling pin for him to play with. They also gave us some cheesy garlic bread on the house, which we all loved. We also got the usual complementary bread and oil, of course, which was also good.   All in all this is a really nice little place. Highly, highly recommended over chains like Olive Garden. We'll probably continue to order our carry-out from Vincent's, but when we're in the mood to go out for Italian food, Bell' Italia will be high on our list.

Super server. One woman ran the counter and the other took care of a pretty good number of lunch customers. I was impressed.   Food was good...not the best Korean I've head, but yummy. Lunch prices are very good, while dinner prices seemed high. I'd have to see the portions to judge for sure. If you like Korean BBQ try the $11.95 meat sampler.   I imagine a lot here depends on who is working on any given day. If they only schedule two people for lunch rush I could see an eitely different review.

I live just up the street from here and pass the place all the time. Today I finally decided to stop in and check it out.   I was there in the middle of a Monday afternoon, so I cannot speak to what the place might be like when they have bands there. But for an afternoon it was just great.  They have a pretty eclectic selection of draft beer, so I had a 90 Shilling (excellent) and a Hemp Ale (also good). They have a couple of more unusual brews, plus the regular assortment of domestic brews, Fat Tire, Kilt Lifter and an IPA....oh and Guinness, of course.  I had just eaten, so I did not try the food, but some of the others in the bar seemed to be enjoying theirs. I looked over the menu, and pledge to return for food and report back.  The gal tending bar was great, super friendly and willing to give me the scoop on the good stuff they had.  Two premium pints and a $3 tip came out to $10. Needless to say, I will be back! An uber-dive to be sure, with low prices to match.

I've passed this place for years and years and always appreciated the old-school appearance--similar to all of those Chinese places I grew up with. The other day we finally got around to trying it.  I was not expecting genuine Chinese food, on the contrary, I was expecting old-school, Chinese-American stuff like chop-suey. In that, I was not disappointed. With a couple of exceptions, their menu could have come out of a Chinese restaurant in the Midwest circa 1970.   I was, however, disappointed with the food, sadly. This is one of those places I was anxious to like--a real throwback and a survivor. But truly, the food was not good. In fact, my egg foo young tasted a little spoiled. I threw it away and ate the friend won tons they gave us. The rest of the food, according to my family, was not that bad, but nothing great. Even the spicy dishes tasted rather bland.   I do love the look of the place, and the service was friendly and efficient. I hate to give it a two star review, but I can't muster any more than that right now.

Gotta support this place!  Sure, it is not the very best Chinese buffet. But it's not bad, and these guys took the plunge and rolled back their prices. This is the definition of a good value.  The variety is decent, maybe a bit smaller than some, but they keep it fresh and the taste is pretty good. They also have the now-expected Mongolian BBQ and a small variety of sushi. Not a lot of surprises, it's the usual Chinese-American fare, but generally fresh and, as I said, cheap.   Service was also very good, attentive, friendly and fast. The atmosphere is about what you would expect from an older Chinese buffet.   If you live in the area please check it out. I hope they are rewarded for lowering their prices.

I have been a Cox customer since 1996. That's fifteen years of paying them each and every month. Finally I decided to give DirecTV a try, though I kept my broadband with Cox.   Through the years there have been ups and downs in their service, but not unlike any other big semi-monopoly. Then, after getting rid of cable television, I went into this "digital store" to return their equipment--cable boxes and remotes etc. What I did not realize was that my DirecTV Internet interface box had been placed with all of the Cox equipment. I just dropped the box and went home, discovering the error later that day, after the retail store had closed. I called Cox and was told there was no way to call the store directly. They told me they would email the person that waited on me as well as the manager. They would call me right back and set the DirecTV part aside for me to pick up later.   You see where this is going. No call the next day, or the day after or the day after. I finally had a chance to get back down to their store during retail hours and they acted like they had never heard of this. The guy went to the back room for a few minutes to make a show of searching for it, but came back emptry. So sorry, we just threw way (or otherwise lost) this $80 part of yours.   Sure, my fault for putting in with the Cox stuff. But after all of my years in retail, and all of the effort I put into tracking down customers that left items in my stores over those years, I felt the Cox's reaction to this business was just terrible and exactly what I would expect these days from a company that has grown too large.

I've been here more times than I can count, but for some reason I am only now thinking to write a review. Until today (when we returned to that other place near Lee Lee's), the last four or five times we have had dim sum we have gone to C-Fu. The reason is simple. You go on Sunday, which for those not in the know is prime dim sum territory, and you are seated and served right away. No lines, no waiting on the carts, no "shu mai is coming" (it seems like most places run out that early even though they must know it is one of the most popular dishes), and fairly attentive service.   Why C-Fu when they food might be slightly better across the street? Well, the quality has gone down a bit. C-Fu which, by the way, was one of the first places to offer dim sum in the Valley, and one of the first around to offer "real" Chinese food, seems to,  once in awhile, rest on their laurels and ease up on yummy-ness. However, the food is still not bad and, because of new competition and the slight decrease in quality, you can get in, get food, and get out quickly. For that, their history, and their quick service, I still give them four stars. I just hope they take the food up a little notch in the future so they can return to their place as the premier Chinese restaurant in the area.

I was working in Fountain Hills today and decided I'd stop in for a cigar on my lunch break. This place was nearby so I decided to check it out.   The store is small, but nice. The owner has really maximized the space to good effect. For a small humidor he had all of the basics covered and the prices were about what you would expect.   So why one star? Two reasons. First, I walked in and no one was there--or whoever was manning the store was in the back room. I set off the chime when I walked in, but nada. I decided to look in the humidor, and I took a great deal of time doing so. Still, when I emerged to make my purchase, still no one there. I waited an additional 5-10 minutes, moving back into the chime's motion sensing field a few times to set it off, and finally gave up. Goodbye lunch break.   Now, to add insult to injury, the whole time I was standing there waiting for someone to show up, there was a TV in the corner blaring out Glenn Beck. Now if you want to be lied to by Beck that's fine. But don't expect to alienate your non-right-wing customers and be successful. Of course, come to think of it, I'm the only non-Republican cigar smoker I know, so maybe he can get away with it. Doesn't mean I have to stand there and listen to it though.   I'll give them another try the next time I'm in FH. I want local businesses to be successful, even if they are Glenn Beck fans. I'll update at that time.

One star because they flat out lied to us. This is the sort of thing I loathe about so many American businesses. They are willing to lose potentially lifelong customers for the sake of saving $100 or so. Here is what happened.   We wanted to get a shelter dog. But it quickly became apparent that the right mix of breed and age was going to be difficult to find at a shelter (I have a preschool age son and two cats, so we thought a puppy would be the best fit) . So we started to look at breeders and private families. One day we decided to stop here just to look at a variety of breeds in one place, with no intention of actually buying anything there.   The thing is, they had this little dachshund puppy that we really fell in love with. The price was too high, but they came down $150 and said when we picked him up we would be able to draw from a bucket and receive either $100, $200 or $300 worth of store credit. We finally decided to bite the bullet and pay way more than expected, figuring at least the drawing would allow us to get his supplies. At the time he had an ear infection and we had to wait ten days to pick him up.  You can guess what happened. We show up to get the dog and they tell us that we do not get to draw because of the deal they made us at the beginning and a $40 "kennel" they gave us that day. During the course of the ten day wait we had been visiting the puppy at the store so I was not about to tell my four year old to forget about his puppy so, of course I still took the dog. But they are now on my list of most hated businesses, along with Thrifty Rent-a-Car and Olive Garden--the sort of place I will talk about for the rest of my life.   It is a shame because up until this time our experience was positive.

After reading the Yelp reviews I took my family here (they are visiting from out of state). I really would have been better off going to Garcia's or one of the other chains. I really prefer to support locally owned business, but only if they are at least trying.   The service here is poor. The waitress was good enough--she just did not have enough help. You can tell the place is pinching pennies--for instance, they charge for extra chips in addition to understaffing the place.  The food, with one exception, everyone agreed was average. The exception was the menudo, which my wife said was super excellent. Nothing was bad, it is just that nothing other than the menudo stood out.   I really wanted to like this place better--especially since everyone counts on me to find the good places and I told everyone a locally owned place was bound to be better than the chains. Oh well, at least Luigi's Pizza was good at dinnertime today. One out of two for the day.

Right off the bat I want to admit that when it comes to Chinese food I'm spoiled. I've traveled to Asia number of times, eaten a lot in San Francisco, and explored the Chinese restaurants in Phoenix for a lot of years. I have learned to expect a more "authentic" type of Chinese food--the type of place that is frequented by actual Chinese people.  Still, I love these little family run places so we checked this place out, hoping for the best. I wanted to like it, but I just did not like the food. The crispy chicken chow mien noodles were the type you get out of a can or bag, not the real thing. The other items were pretty standard Chinese-American fare. Honestly, I like Panda better, and it is cheaper. My stepson loved the shrimp though--said it was the best he has had since living in the US, so your mileage may vary.   Others have enjoyed this place. The service is friendly and they deliver if you live in the general area. Portions are very large. If you are not expecting a lot you might like it better.

Is it possible for a cigar shop to be even less friendly than Fair Oaks? Yes...or at least I have found a tie.   I've been in here twice. They will answer questions, but any attempt to enter into a discussion is met with a look like "who is this guy?" Friendlier than Fair Oaks? Marginally. But there have been two guys working here the times I  have visited so it seems at least one of them would give me the time of day. Also, someone said the regulars are a joy to hang out with? Really? The same two guys (not the ones that are working out front) have been in  the lounge both visits, and neither time did they so much as nod a hello. Maybe I am just visiting at the wrong time. At least they don't charge extra for the priviledge of hanging out there (like Tinderbox Ahwatukee and others).   That said, the selection is good. The place has an old, well-worn feel that I like a lot. It smells like the really old-school smoke shop/news stands of my youth. If you are a pipe smoker I have not seen a better selection in Phoenix, but the cigar area is also well-stocked. Prices are about what you would expect.   Two stars or three stars? If it had someone friendly working there I would say four or more. But look, I can buy any cigar or any pipe tobacco or anything else for that matter online and pay lot less. I go to these places to chat about cigars, get some ideas, and try new stuff--hopefully supporting local business a little in the bargain. So I grade very high on service and friendliness when it comes to cigar shops. Two out of two visits here have resulted in the feeling that I was intruding in a private club.   Based on the other stellar reviews I might give it one more shot if I am in the area.

Having seen a story about this place in the paper, we made the fairly long drive up there from Ahwatukee today. It's not something I would do every week, but it is worth it once in awhile.   We did not try the restaurant, but loved the meat area and the bakery. The service was really fast and extraordinarily friendly. The prices were pretty good, especially considering the fact that you know you are getting fresh product ($4.99/lb tenderloin, $3.99/lb. cubed steak, $2.99/lb on pork chops etc.). The selection was good, but not great, but the overall experience was memorable. We'll go back, especially if we are heading up that direction anyway. We're looking forward to trying their restaurant next time.

The best chicken shawarma I have ever had. Just the best.   The place is run down, really in need of a makeover. I don't care too much about that if the health department is okay with them.   The grocery selection is okay, but better at the other location down the street. I think if they could add fresh carryout stuff--tabouleh and hummus, for instance--it would really make them a five star place.  Just a great sandwich. I can't wait to go back and try some of their other stuff. How have I lived in the Valley since 1996 and not tried this before?

I've been back two more times this week. Three times in one week to a single place is a new record for me. I have had a chance to try the koobideah and the beef shawarma. Both were very good, but to me nothing compares to their chicken shawarma. I'll keep sampling though.

I usually buy all of my booze at Total Wine or BevMo. However, having read the reviews here, and wanting to support local businesses, I made the drive up to Tempe to check out Tops.  Is this the unfriendliest place in town? I think it has to be right up there. The guy at the register acted like he was doing me a big favor ringing up my not-so-well-priced bottle of single malt scotch. I hate that.  The overall selection is certainly good, but not as good as Total Wine, in my opinion. That said, they do have a tremendous variety of scotch and Irish whiskey. They have bottles stuck here and there all over the place. It sort of becomes like a treasure hunt to find all of the places they have stuffed the odd bottle. That was kind of fun. They also have a few I have never heard of, which is pretty cool.   But I  can't get over the awful service. Others here have had better luck, so maybe I'll give it another try in the future, but not for awhile. It seems like the place has built a reputation, and is now resting on its laurels.

I was looking for Laphroaig 15 year old and they did not have it at Total Wine. We were in the neighborhood so I decided to try Tops one more time. Today's experience could not be more different than last time. For one thing, the guy at the counter actually spoke to me, and he said something friendly ("hello"). I could not find the thing I was looking for, so he went back and got the manager who found it right away, and at a great price. There was another guy there also and we all stood around and talked a little bit about single malts. They do know their stuff. I think for Scotch and Irish Whiskey drinkers this place is five stars when the right employees are working. I gave it four stars because I still think other places have a better overall selection these days. But I stress, for Scotch the place can't be beat. I found another trove I did not notice before, so their selection is even better than I originally thought.

We originally stopped at the little Japanese store next door for their lunch bowls, but being underwhelmed by the selection and seeing very little room inside to eat, we wandered next door to Tokyo Stop.  I love these little places--very small, but low overhead means lower prices, and less of a chance that the place will go out of business. We were there for lunch, and the place was super busy, but the owner treated everyone like they were a VIP customer.   The food was good--I had the Katsu Bowl, while my wife and stepson had different types of noodles (can't recall exactly what now...this was a few days ago). Anyway, everything was good--not great--but good, and especially good for the price.   Again, this is a very non-fancy, family run, very small, very friendly, inexpensive, decent place for lunch. Try it out next time you are in the area.

Yuk! Edible, but not good at all. We were in the mood for fake Chinese tonight and had a flier from this place. We ordered quite a bit, and no one really liked anything. Egg Foo Young--overwhelmingly garlicky. Crispy Noodles with Chicken--the same style of noodles that you get out of a can. You get the idea.   The second star is due to the fast service.   We had been considering ordering carry-out from Mandalay Noodle World, which we tried a few days ago and liked a lot. But, not finding a menu online, we went with this place. Big, $45, mistake.

I know it is a chain, but I am hard pressed to find better barbecue in Phoenix. The rib tips are among the best I have ever tasted. The brisket and ribs are also good. The hot links are good, but not as wonderful as the other stuff. I buy their sauces for home and go through Devil Spit like water.   Service is always good too. They also do a great job at catering. They handled food at an event I recently coordinated and they handled 200 plus people very efficiently.   I highly recommend Famous Dave's to anyone who likes barbecue. There is better at certain mom and pop places in the South, but again, I put it up against anything in Phoenix--even Joe's in Gilbert.

Love it! I heard they allow cigar smoking on the patio, so I decided to wait out the traffic over there this evening. I did not try the food--I'll write an update in a few days with that, but I had a beer and cigar and was blown away with how friendly the place is. The harried bartender actually smiled at me despite waiting on a ton of people, and while I was waiting on a beer a guy came up and started talking to me about the cigars in my front pocket. He introduced me to someone else, and before I knew it there were five of us standing out on the porch in the rain and cold weather chitchatting like we had known each other for years.   I just had a beer, but it was an Imperial Pint of Smithwicks for $4--great happy hour price. The only negative I could find was the parking. It was tight. I just happened to get lucky and there was someone pulling out as I was pulling in. But some of the regulars pointed out some street parking in case I am not as lucky next time.   Maybe I just caught them on a good night, but I will be back often if it is even half as friendly as this time. I wish I lived closer to the place. I have yet to find anyplace even close to this in Ahwatukee or Chandler. If you know of a place, PLEASE let me know.

My impression of this place might have been influenced by very high expectations. I lived in Ahwatukee from 1999-2003. Back then, I heard numerous times about how great this place was, about strategies for holding out until the best meats arrived, and about the awesomeness of the salad bar. At the time I had recently returned to school to pursue my MA degree, so money was tight and I was never able to afford to try it. But I was intrigued.   Fast forward to 2009. When I moved back to Ahwatukee from a long exile in Surprise, trying Fogo e Brasa (or Brazilian Bull as they now call themselves) was high on my list. My wife and I made reservations and showed up, expecting something amazing.  I don't know. The food was good enough: all-you-can-eat meats that they bring on skewers to your table. I think other reviewers have described the process so I'll skip that. Some of the meats were fantastic, others not so much. Nothing was terrible, but only one or two things were excellent. We were expecting at least one very high end meat, perhaps filet mignon, and it never came, so we were disappointed by that. The salad bar was everything people say it is, but for the price I would expect that. Drinks were expensive. Service was decent, but not outstanding.   In the end we spent a little over $100 for the two of us. Walking out I just did not feel like it was worth the money. We would have been better off spending the same money at Durant's or someplace similar.

We shop at Lee Lees all the time (in the same shopping center), and we had eaten at Phoenix Palace back when it was a buffet, but it was only recently that we realized that they now serve dim sum everyday.   So today we rushed over there to check it out. The wife, while born and raised in the Philippines, is of Chinese descent and grew up around this stuff. When you consider that, along with the fact that our first date was ten days together in Hong Kong (dim sum heaven), you can see that the bar is pretty high for us when it comes to dim sum. Now, we know we cannot expect Hong Kong or even San Francisco quality in Phoenix necessarily. Still, the food at Phoenix Palace was quite good overall. We were not disappointed.   We had two types of shu mai, along with har gow, jellyfish, barbecue pork buns, sesame balls, pot stickers, and spring rolls. We missed the chicken feet, which is one of Carol's favorites, but we'll get to that next time. All was great, but the har gow especially stood out. It was a quite different flavor than what we have had at Golden Buddha, C-Fu or any of the other local places. Everything was yummy though.   The service, on the other hand, was mixed. It started out nice, with a friendly greeting by the guy that seated us. But it went downhill from there. Its not that they were rude or unfriendly. It was more like benign neglect. The carts came around quickly enough, but once we had the food we did not see anyone again until it was time to settle the bill. No refills, in other words. That said, at least the glasses were large and we had a pot of hot tea, so it was not the end of the world. Another gripe--no chile oil. I  think I'll bring my own next time. Or maybe we just caught them on a bad day.  The food was a four or a five by local standards, while the service was a two or a three. Since I can't give 3.5 stars I'll go with four. It's really nice to see a growing number of decent dim sum restaurants in town. Hopefully this is a trend that will continue.   By the way, they have a take out counter also, as well as a regular menu. We'll check that out sometime in the future and report back.

You've seen the Hong Kong films where the young aspirant travels to the master to be bathed in wisdom? My visit here tonight felt a lot like that--except I'm not very young, and Timothy is not very old.    Timothy Torres, a Cuban immigrant, comes from a family that has been making cigars for generations. I walked into the store to find him alone, watching Telemundo. He greeted me warmly, recommended one of his cigars (with tobacco that is "merely" 12 years old) and we sat down on one of his comfortable couches; where he proceeded to give me a long talk on his philosophy, which, simply put, boils down to quality over quantity, and art over commerce. I was fortunate enough to be there when another customer came in and requested that a special cigar be made for him. Timothy went to work, and I was privileged to witness old-school cigar making in action. This is an experience I will always remember. The 12 year old I sampled was the best cigar I have ever had--including the genuine Cubans I have smoked while abroad. What a treasure we have so close, right in downtown Mesa.   The shop itself is simple, yet comfortable--big couches, a television, and a free club that allows you to bring in limited amounts of beer or wine. The prices are very reasonable indeed for what you are getting--no Swisher Sweets here, mind you, in fact, no Padrons, no Montecristos or anything else beside his own creations.  Anyone who thinks of himself as a cigar aficionado owes it to himself to drive immediately to Torres Cigar Factory to experience this first hand. Wonderful!

Since this review I have tried his 25 year old Churchill. Now that is the best cigar I have ever smoked.

LOVE IT. After our horrible experience yesterday at Szechuan Palace this place was like a breath of fresh air. At work the other day I trained a gal from Hong Kong. After the training I asked her if she had found any good Hong Kong style restaurants and she recommended this place. I'm glad I asked.   We were greeted at the door and water arrived right away. Super friendly. Excellent, HUGE menu. Here the American and Chinese menus are combined, so there is no need to ask for the "secret menu."   We ordered two Hong Kong style chow meins, one chicken and one seafood; egg rolls for our son; spicy dumplings, spicy sauce chicken hot pot; and Kung Pao beef for my stepson. Everything was just great.   This is a little family run strip mall place. Nothing fancy. Nothing pretentious. Just my kind of place--good food, good service, and good prices. Highly recommended.

Okay, finally, mission accomplished. I have finally found Sonoran hot dogs in the Phoenix area (that are not sold off of a cart that comes and goes). While not as good as El Guero Canelo or BK in Tucson, these were pretty good. Plus, I don't have to drive 100 miles to get them.   I also had the carne asada torta. It was pretty good, though the buns were a little overdone, giving the whole thing a slightly burned taste. This seems to be a common problem with tortas though. My wife had a chile relleno and the menudo. She thought the chili relleno was the best she's had locally, while the menudo was decent. She though Filiberto's was better, so that gives you an idea.   This is a nice looking little place in a rougher area of Mesa, and it was clean and pleasant. Service was pretty good, not super-friendly but efficient and not hostile in any way. All of the food above, along with drinks and the side dishes that came with the main courses, came up to about $28. Not bad.   This is more of a three star place, but the fact that they have Sonoran hot dogs, plus the fact that the chili relleno is, according to my wife, top notch, convinced me to give it the extra star.

Burrito Heaven. I'm really getting behind on my Yelping, but I had to at least get to my review for the Original Burrito Company.  When I looked them up here on Yelp and saw slightly under four stars I was taken aback. Who could give a low rating to this place? Even if the Soup Nazi was the owner, the quality and quantity for the money should put it over four stars. I NEVER go to the same restaurant twice in two days, but yesterday and the day before I stopped here--the second day because I was just curious about the other stuff on their menu. I should mention I live about ten miles from here.   It started on Monday when I was bringing my son back from the doctor near Ahwatukee. It occurred to me as we left that I had lived in Ahwatukee twice before (I'm now in Tempe) and never tried the Original Burrito Company. I decided to rectify the situation.  I don't think this place is ever slow, but I caught them at a good time. There was no one in line in front of me, though the counter person was doing other stuff and took a couple of minutes to greet me--more on this later. I opted for the carne asada burrito. It arrived in a few minutes and it was AWESOME! When I think burritos I typically think FLATULENCE because 9 times out of 10 they are 50% beans at the very least. Here, with this particular burrito, they give you an option of either beans or guacamole. I went for guacamole and it came out to about 85% carne asada (yummy), 10% guacamole (good), and 5% salsa verde (excellent and spicy). This was $4.50 including chips.   The next day my wife and I stopped by. I had the red chili burrito and my wife had the pollo con chili rojo y arroz. Mine was $3.65 and hers was $4.45, including chips, and both were awesome. Again, both were stuffed with the main ingredients and not a bunch of beans and other fillers. Somebody here mentioned that they are skimpy on the ingredients, but I have found the exact opposite to be true on my two visits. Maybe when that reviewer visited they were training a new employee.   The only drawback that I can find is the service. It is not bad, but not super friendly or real attentive. No one greeted me when I walked in and both times it took the woman behind the counter a couple of minutes to say anything to me. But once she started taking my order all was well.   For anyone wanting no-frills Mexican--burritos in particular--this place is Heaven.

I have mixed feelings about this place. I pass it on my way to work every day, and finally I had a chance to try it out after months of intending to.   The good: There were only two people working, but they handled a large lunch rush pretty efficiently. I like it that they bring out a complimentary spring roll and soup while you wait for them to take your order. The food came out pretty quickly considering the crowd, and they took my money at the end with no undue delay--maybe a little too fast as I discuss below.  The bad: The food was bland. I assume it was catering to American tastes, but when I asked for it to be spiced up (which the menu indicated was an option), I was told that they would give me peppers on the side. Service was not friendly, but not exactly unfriendly either. They could have benefited from one or two extra servers. They also seemed like they were in a big hurry for us to leave, though the crowd was thinning by the time we were done. I'll cut them slack on this one, since it was lunch and I am sure most people are in a hurry.   My wife and shared the Thai Hut Chicken Noodles and Pad Thai. The former tasted eerily of Campbell's Chicken and Noodle soup with some of the broth removed, while the latter was no better than the ready-to-eat version that they sell at Fresh and Easy. I'm spoiled living where I do in Tempe, so close to about a dozen really good Thai places, so your mileage may vary.   I like the diner-like appearance of the place. It's almost like a Waffle House, only with Thai cuisine (or at least, the watered-down, Americanized version of it. I also appreciate the speed for the lunch crowd. But in all, I was not too impressed.

This place used to have an Afghan lunch buffet, and when I returned to find that gone, replaced by yet another Indian place, I was disappointed initially.   But wait! This is the most excellent Indian buffet I have tried in Phoenix. Even better than Maharaja Palace, which was my favorite before this. I have been back at least five times since, and every time the food is just awesome. They do tend to have the same chicken dishes each time I am here--not sure if that is luck of the draw or if they just do the same thing all the time. But the flavor is so great I don't care. My wife also loves the fact that they have a goat curry on the buffet. I've not seen that elsewhere. They also have tandoori chicken on the buffet, rather than bringing a couple of pieces out to your table like a lot of restaurants do.   I need to try this place for their dinner menu. If the buffet is this good, I can only imagine how awesome the regular menu must be.  In addition to the food, the service is very good, and the place is clean (can't say the same about Maharaja Palace).   I would put this restaurant up in the top of my overall favorite Indian places worldwide. I have had better in Hong Kong and San Francisco and Chicago, but only slightly better.

Wow, another five star review. This has been a good weekend for eating out.   This is a smallish strip mall restaurant. I seem to remember it being a Chinese carryout back in the old days. Now it is one of the best Thai restaurants in the Valley.   We had Pad Thai, Green Curry, and Lemon Chicken. All was just wonderful. We asked for it all the be cooked "number five," which is "Thai Spicy." Truly excellent, and actually spicy--not wimped down.  The little place is decorated with all sorts of interesting pictures, photos, statues and other odds and ends. The did a good job decorating what had been at one time a pretty plain store front--though I probably would not decorate my house similarly.   Service was some of the best I've experienced. The waiter was friendly and knowledgable. He brought a little juice box for our toddler, which was a nice touch. After lunch the owner came out and talked with us for awhile. She told us that she grows a lot of the herbs and spices in her own garden. You can tell. She also asked us to let her know, personally, if things are ever subpar. She said that when they get busy she worries sometimes that someone will leave unhappy. After chatting with us for awhile she gave little Dan another juice box, so he also gives the place five stars.  I really hope people support this little gem. I wish we had more places like it. Outstanding.

Like the review I wrote yesterday, I wish I could give it three and a half stars, but since I can't it gets four. Why?  Well, they basically do one thing and they do it well--cheesesteak. I got one with provolone and raw onions and it was really great--real steak, a little light on the cheese but not too bad, and just the right about of chopped onions. The bread was soft and tasty also, obviously freshly baked. Yes, I know provolone and raw onions is heresy to someone from Philly, but since I'm from Indiana I don't care. Cheese wiz? You can have it. Anyway, with real cheese these things are good. As a bonus, they offer three types of peppers in the condiment bar, which put the place over the top for me. I'll leave it to others to judge the "genuine" Philly style sandwich.   Service was also good and friendly, and the place is as clean as anyplace I've been. The only complaint I have is it is a little expensive. I spent a little over $11 for a large sandwich and a coke with no sides. Also, if you don't like cheesesteak you're kind of out of luck. But what they do they do very well. I'll certainly be back. The only reason I would have given it three and a half rather than four stars is because of the price.   And those four and five star reviews I've been writing? I promised myself I would only write about restaurants I have eaten at since I started writing these reviews. I promise when I eat at a bad restaurant I won't mince words! I have a whole bunch in mind, but I want to wait and give them another chance.

Love it! This is by far my favorite general grocery chain. Their prepared entrees have become a staple in our house. I love having 85% of everything I need in a small and very convenient format. I just wish they would open all of the other locations they planned.

We finally got around to trying this place a couple of days ago. Good stuff.   It is a very casual, low-key place. The server was super friendly and quick. We ordered appetizers of fried gator and fried okra. The okra was okay, the gator was darn good--better than the stuff I tried in New Orleans years back, believe it or not.   My wife had jambalaya, my stepson had some sort of seafood rice plate, and I had a grilled chicken poboy. Everything was good, and the prices were reasonable. Go during happy hour and you'll save even more money.  I see some negative reviews here on Yelp, but our experience was very good. A nice, low-price alternative to Pappadeaux.

What? Nothing with grease?   My wife and I drove by the Mesa Pita Jungle today and decided to stop by. This is not a place I would normally visit. I like meat, pizza and all of the other unhealthy things you can think of. But we were in the mood for Mediterranean food, and had little time to drive around.   Last time I was in Pita Jungle was back in the 1990's. So, for me, this was almost like my first visit, and for my wife it was really her first visit. I'm so glad we stopped here.   The focus here, of course, is on healthy Mediterranean cuisine.So, there are a few key items missing from the typical Mediterranean menu. But what Pita Jungle does it does very well indeed.   I had the chicken shawarma pita, the closest thing to my normal unhealthy diet I could find. My wife had the Mediterranean plate. We shared both.   Lots stood out here. The baba ganoush was, perhaps, the best I have ever had--certainly right up there. The falafel was also outstanding. My chicken shawama was also very, very good. Everything was good, but those three really stood out as superb.   Service was also outstanding. We were seated outside and not neglected in the least. Food was on the table in minutes. Just great.  I started to give Pita Jungle four stars because I don't want people to think I'm an easy grader. But the food was great, service was great, the atmosphere was even nice, though we were outside next to the parking lot. I have to go with five.

After years of meaning to do it, we finally checked out the Cornish Pasty Company.   I had the Oggie with a side of mashed potatoes and a Boddingtons. The wife had the Lamb Vindaloo and we shared a cider. We also had a side of chips and our niece had a salad. The food was very good over all, and I would say the Vindaloo was outstanding (I took a few bites off my wife's plate). Please don't order it if you can't stand spiciness though. Too many restaurants nowadays are wimping out on spice because people order something they can't handle and send it back to the kitchen or complain (try finding truly hot buffalo wings these days, for instance). But for spice lovers, it was A-1.   These things take awhile to bake, so don't go if you're in a big hurry. They had one lady waiting the tables, and as time went by the place got busier and busier. But she kept up with it somehow, and just when I thought she would surely forget something, it would arrive. It was very impressive, actually. The food did arrive a little out of order, again, thanks to the baking time. But it was not a big problem.   Someone else has mentioned the good music they play on the jukebox and the nice seating they have outside. Add to that a decent beer selection and you have a darn good experience. We'll be back for sure.

I won't write much, because I would only be repeating what has been said here already. We tried Boca 7 today and shared the 7 course beef dinner. There was so much food, and the service was so wonderful, I kept wondering if I had read the menu right--was this $29.95 total or $29.95 per person? Well, our total bill, including drinks, came out to only $36.00! Great food, great service, and excellent prices. As an extra bonus, we discovered a very inexpensive Filipino/Hawaiian grill in the Mekong Plaza food court afterwards.

Five stars because I just had the best tacos (of this type) in my entire life at this place!  Yes, this is a fast food environment, yes they serve the food on paper plates, yes you bus your own table etc. etc. Who cares? Does everything have to be Durant's? The fact is, they do Mexican basics better than just about anyone.   I had shredded beef tacos and a single chicken soft taco. Both were the best in their class I have had in my life--including those I've had on trips to Mexico. The hard shell is done in a similar style to what you would find at Filiberto's The soft taco, well, is was a soft taco, but made with Carolina's famous tortillas. Both were a perfect combination of spice, meat, and cheese, with the usual lettuce thrown on as an after thought. The salsa you get out of the little pumps by the soda fountain was also very good.   Housed in an old Fazoli's or Pizza Hut or something, the atmosphere and appearance is similar to one of the newer Filiberto's, but the food sets it apart from the rest.   Oh, and it is cheap.   Love it!

After reading the Yelp reviews, we had been looking forward to trying this place. We were not disappointed.  We had dinner there on a weeknight. Eventually we'll get around to trying the Sunday brunch everyone raves about. I had the ribeye and my wife had the rack of lamb. Everything was excellent, though the steak was better without the sauce the put on it. Next time I'll ask them to leave it off.   Service was excellent, though we were there on a very slow night, so I cannot judge what it might be like on a Saturday or during their popular brunch.   Prices were high, but actually less than I expected for the quality. With drinks and tip we spent about $80 for the two of us. But it was a rare date for us, so I did not mind too much.   In all, it was a good experience.

For those of you who have never been in a Pro's Ranch Market, you don't know what you're missing! It's about as close to Mexico as you can get this side of the border. Go for the gargantuan meat selection, the amazing produce section, the huge food court, the salsa bar, the bakery, and the fun atmosphere. All of the Pro's Ranch Markets are great, but this one in Mesa is a little easier to navigate than those in the west Valley if you are Spanish-challenged like I am. Warning: like all of the Pro's locations, this place can get super-busy.

Based on the Yelp reviews it had received, we all went to visit Karey's Kitchen yesterday for lunch. This is the second new Filipino place we have tried in as many weeks.   The place is very small, but nice and cozy (maybe about the size of Mi Cocina Mi Pais). We went after traditional lunch-rush hours, so it was not too cramped. I'm actually glad they opted for a small location. Several of our favorite places have gone out of business lately due to too much overhead, so it's good they are keeping their expenses low. We had our toddler with us, so we opted for the outdoor seating and all was well.  We tried a variety of Filipino dishes and everything was great. I had the chicken adobo and kaldereta--both were excellent, as was the garlic rice I had on the side. My wife and niece, who are both Filipinas, also were impressed with the food--especially the cassava cake, which they raved about. Karey's also offers Mexican-Filipino fusion dishes which we did not try this time, but I might go for an adobo burrito or something next time and update the review. The service was also outstanding--super-friendly and fast. My wife ended up having a very nice long conversation with the owners after our lunch.   Living in a Fil-Am household we are always looking for new places to stock up on Filipino food. My wife is a restaurant manager (Panda Express), so the last thing she wants to do at home is cook--and as for me, well if it does not involve fire or barbeque sauce its better that we not go there. So, we order take-out food frequently. Along with Wholly Grill, we now have two new staples. I can tell right now I will be stopping here on my way home from work A LOT!  I'm giving Karey's five stars based on the fact that the food was good, the service was fast, and the owners were super-friendly. That goes a long way in my book.

Finding places like this is the reason I love Yelp. It is one of those strip mall hole in the walls that you drive passed all the time, but never notice. Good thing I read the Yelp reviews.   It is a small, modest, family owned place. Lots of Chinese customers, which is always a good sign. Like many restaurants of this type, there are two menus, the one for the Americans and the one for the Chinese. As always, go for the Chinese menu.   I had the Pan Fried Noodles with Chicken and Carol had the Szechuan Sizzling Shrimp and Scallop. We shared an order of Hand Ripped Spicy Cabbage (recommended by another Yelper) and we got an eggroll for our son. It was all very good, well priced and in good portions. The cabbage was especially good. Oh, the hot tea was also outstanding.   Service was friendly and efficient. Total bill without tip was $28. Its just too bad that all of the other Americans in the place were ordering from the Americanized menu. I felt like telling them to get the other menu, but minded my own business.

I see some reviewers have given this place low scores because they are not selling Sonoran food. Hey, you people, it says in big letters on the building MEXICO CITY CUISINE.It is not a Sonoran Restaurant. Its like people ordering spicy Thia food or hot wings and then complaining about the spice. Thanks to these sorts of people restaurants end up dumbing down their food to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Stop it. Go to Taco Bell if that's what you want.  Anyway, this is the third location of La Parrilla Suiza I have visited, the first was Tucson and the second was the 35th Ave. location. Nice looking place. The food was more or less as I remember it, though the chorizo might have been a little less tasty. Their chips and salsas are awesome so be careful not to fill up on those before your food comes. Prices are in line with most other casual dining places. They also have a really nice bar inside. Service was also very good.   If you want a change from the typical Sonoran give this place a try.

We placed an order for delivery last weekend--large pepperoni pizza, baked ziti with eggplant, and calamari. Everything was great, especially for a delivery place. The pizza ranks up there among my favorites in Phoenix. The pasta was also very good--my wife especially loved it. The calamari was pretty darn good also (this comes from someone who dislikes seafood). Delivery only took about 40 minutes on a Saturday night. All in all I highly recommend this place. I'm giving it four stars, but if I compare it to other places offering delivery, that would move up to a five.

I'm working out at Litchfield Park this month so I finally had a chance to try Senior Taco--a place that always seems packed at their Fountain Hills location the times I am up there.   This is sort of a Filiberto's-style place. It is fast food, it has a similar menu. The prices are similar. However, the food was quite different.   I tried three things, trying some of each and bringing some back to the office with me. First, the carne asada torta. I would say this is the most similar in flavor to Filibertos. Not bad, but not super great. It would have benefited from more meat and less guacamole. I also had a shredded beef, hard-shell taco. This was quite a bit different than Filiberto's and, in my opinion, better. They did not fry it as much, and it had a lot more cheese than I usually get at Filibertos. I also had the carne asada soft taco. The size was large and it was very good. Nothing here is super great, but the tacos were especially yummy.   Service, cleanliness and all of the rest were average or above for a fast food restaurant.   I give it 3.5 stars--leaning toward four due to the size of the dishes for the price.

We stopped by Mekong Plaza yesterday to shop at the market and eat at Boca 7 (which is very good). In the back of the mall, in the nearly empty food court, is a brand new Filipino-Hawaiian place called Wholly Grill. Since we had already eaten we bought some items to-go to try for dinner. Considering we ate the food hours later and microwaved it, everything was good. What made it exceptional was the amount of food we got for the price. Also, the lady running it is from Cebu, and the style of cooking there differs from the Manila style most Phoenix Filipino restaurants employ (this according to my wife who was born in Manila but spent her adult life in Cebu). I hope this place will thrive. Its great to have an inexpensive Filipino place in town that can cook Cebuano dishes!

I somehow missed this all of the times I have driven by it.   The place is as clean as an operating room. They have a small bar, and seating elsewhere for maybe 30 or so people. The actual brewery is in a large open area behind the bar, so you can watch that going on while you drink.   The clean smell of the place reminded me of the days when I lived near the Miller Brewery in Milwaukee. If the wind was blowing the right direction it carried the stench of dirty socks right up to my door. Why is it that these small breweries have no smell? Anyway, I was wondering about that as I sampled their brand new Oktoberfest and their Hefeweizen. Both excellent, and served at the right temperature.   Others here have mentioned the lack of food. They did have signs up saying they were carrying some food now, but I did not investigate.   Finally, the service was friendly, and the crowd was friendly. What more could you ask for?

Pretty good. They have actual poppy seed buns that taste like what I remember when I used to go to Chicago. Had the Chicago style dog with chili cheese fries--health food, in other words. Good all around, though I thought just a little on the pricy side...about $10 for the fries, hot dog and a drink. Nothing fancy here, but good for what it is.

Yesterday was my third time back and I have to bump them up to five stars now. I had the Italian beef this time and it was probably the best I have ever had, certainly better to my taste than Al's in Chicago. The service just keeps getting better and better also. Prices can get a little high when you start to add things--for instance peppers or cheese--but still worth it.

I read about this place in Phoenix Magazine. I drive by this all the time, but never noticed it, hidden as it is in a non-descript strip mall.   Three of us went and we ordered a ton of stuff. None of us had ever tried Venezuelan food, and we wanted to try as many things as possible. Here is what we had: Arepas Sampler, patacon, pepito (one pork and one steak), Parilla Argentina, chachaps, fried yucca and one or two other things. We shared this stuff, and took a lot home. Portions are pretty generous. Our least favorite items were the pepitos, which are essentially big sub sandwiches. Not bad, but not up to par with the rest of the food, which ranged from good to awesome. I discovered that I love south American chorizo (I think they sell either the Columbian or Argentinian variety).  Now this place does not look like much. It is connected to Rosatti's Pizza for some reason; I assume they have the same owner. I'm pretty sure our waiter was going back and forth between restaurants. That said, once you get your food drinks refills are self-serve anyway, so no big deal.   In all, a very memorable experience and one that I recommend to the slightly adventurous Yelper.

After driving by it many times we finally got over to Contigo Peru today. Excellent all around. The place was fairly busy, but service was fast. All of the customers were speaking Spanish to the staff, so I took that as a good sign that people from the region of Peru were regulars.   As someone else mentioned, the first thing you get is this salsa with bread. I could taste cilantro, mint and other great stuff in there. Super yummy. I wish I could buy it by the gallon.  My wife had a seafood dish, and we had a 1/4 baked chicken to share with our toodler, and I had another chicken dish (my apologies, I should have written down the names of everything). All was just wonderful. Our server was very helpful and spent some time helping us decide what to order.  The servings were a bit small for the price, and that is the only fault I could find. That said, it was enough food, so this is a small gripe.   In all, I recommend this place and plan to visit again soon.

Nothing fancy, but the food was good and inexpensive for this type of thing. The counter guy was pretty new, learning the job, but he did a decent job. It took a little while for the food to come, but you expect that for the type of food. There were three of us so we tried a pretty good assortment of food, and everyone was pleased.   I'm usually more long winded than this, but what else is there to say? Not a place to take a date, but good, inexpensive, Mediterranean food.

My cup runneth over. After my near-spiritual experience at Torres Cigar Factory I checked this place out the next day. Super, super friendly, and new enough that there are no cliques. The selection is not overwhelming, but he has all the favorites. Best of all, he has a very nice, comfy lounge/club area that is...ready for this...FREE!!! I like Tinder Box, but whenever I am there and want to have a cigar I feel like a steerage-class passenger on the Titanic. All the "special" people that can afford it are in the club, while the rest of us hoi polloi are outside in 3rd class. I live practically across the street from Tinder Box, which is a fine store, but it is worth it to me to drive down the road to this place.

A pizza buffet that costs $5 a head. What can you expect from a place like that? As it turns out, nothing much good.  First of all, $5 a person is a little misleading. Drinks go for an addition $2+ each, and if you want wings, add another $5 per person. It can add up.   The pizza just sucks. Actually, there was one with a very thin crust that my wife and I both liked, but it was gone most of the time. There is the problem--nothing good lasts very long and all the worst, coldest, most disgusting pizza hangs around on the buffet forever.  Service sucks too. It took about a year to get our severly overpriced wings. At least they were edible when they did come.   The place is newish, but still manages to look a little dirty and run down--not in a charming, family-doing-the-best-they-can-to-keep-the business-going way either. More like a we-don't-give-a-crap-and-are too-cheap-to-make-restroom-repairs way.  All that said, my 5 year old loved the place, so I will be back kicking and screaming.

Someone here mentioned they are out of business. Not so. We just ate there a couple of hours ago. They did *look* like they were out of business. When we pulled up there was only one car in the parking lot. But checking the door we discovered they were open for business, just slow at the time.   We were greeted and seated right away. Very friendly service from start to finish. The server kept bringing stuff for my little son unasked.   The food was also good. Maybe not quite as good as the Havana Cafe that used to be in Ahwatukee (I have not tried the Camelback location), but a lot less expensive.   I had the Cuban Sandwich. Yummy! My wife had Ropa Vieja with rice and fried plantains and she liked it very much. My stepson had Chicken Habanero. He liked it, but wished he had ordered it spicy instead of mild. In all, very good food. Oh, the appetizer, chicken turnovers, was great, if expensive for the portion.  I'm glad we stopped in today. This is almost walking distance to my house, so I am sure we'll be back.

I see others here have had better luck with this place. Maybe I'll give it another shot some day.  Nothing terrible, mind you. It is a nice looking place. However, you walk in and there is nothing to indicate whether you sit, wait to be seated or order at the counter. I finally went to the counter where the service was lukewarm, though it got better as the day went by. The initial impression of the place just left a bad taste in my mouth.   But the real problem for me just boiled down to taste and price. I ordered the combo sandwich, which is supposed to be sausage and meatballs. Problem is, it was 90% meatball with very little sausage; and the meatballs were very bland and kind of mushy. The price, while not terrible, was too high for the quality.   I have not tried their pizza, and I have only been there for lunch, so your experience may differ.

Just excellent. My dryer broke down and father and son came out to my house that same evening. The price was fair and service was just outstanding. Oh, and this was all on New Year's Eve.   It is great to see little family businesses like this. I cannot recommend them enough.

After our last service expected us to work for them apparently (constant complaining that we were not doing enough) we fired them and hired Captain Clear. So far they have been awesome. They do an amazing job every time, and so far at least, have not charged my anything for extra chemicals. My former company always had something else they wanted to charge me for. On top of all that, you can pay online, and check your test results online as well. Highly recommended.

Saturday I was in the market for a Weber Smokey Mountain so I visited BBQ Island, having never been there before.   Wow...a candy store for barbecue enthusiasts--a huge selection of grills, of course, but also accessories, woods and charcoals, rubs and sauces, and big equipment--such as offset smokers on trailers. They had everything you could want.  They also hold events from time to time, such as small barbecue competitions.   My only complaint: I asked for the Weber and they were sold out. Once they found out that was all I wanted to quickly lost interest in talking to me. Not really unfriendly, but sending off a vibe.  I'll give them a try for supplies next time and see how they are when it is not quite as busy.

I don't know, I thought it was pretty darn good. I did not have the same experience as the people writing negative reviews here.   My wife and I shared three dishes--Burmese Stir-Fried Noodles with Chicken, Pad Thai, and Burmese Curry. Maybe we were just hungry, but both of us thought the food was very good. The curry and pad thai were spicy like we ordered it (so many places tone it down despite the fact that we ask for spicy) and the Burmese noodles were very tasty, with a wok fried smoky flavor.   Prices were about average, the bill with two cokes was around $28 before tip. The service was decent--friendly, but not super attentive. We had to wait on chopsticks/silverware. But not too bad.   We'll probably do carry out here from time to time. In all, a nice neighborhood place.

Today I decided to get in my car and try a new place for lunch. I was originally headed for La Paloma, but when I walked in all of the chairs were up on the tables. Having been in food service at one time I hate to go in right at closing so I decided to go elsewhere, though they assured me it was no problem. The time is 3:20.   In the same strip mall I spot Hamburger Haven. Their sign says OPEN, they have no hours posted, but there are people inside. I decide to try it out. I walk in to order and wait while another group gets its food then commences to ask for a bunch of little items that keep the guy busy running back and forth. He finally got around to asking me what I wanted. Not friendly, maybe a little annoyed. I order the food. I can see the guy cooking grumble in the back. I'm thinking to myself, "what's so hard about a cheeseburger and onion rings?" I am not feeling welcome.   The food came out. Not bad at all. Nothing great, fried stuff, but decent all the same. I'm sitting there eating, trying to tell myself the bad vibes are my imagination when a third guy appears behind the counter. He looks out at the people in the restaurant, frowns a little, then marches to the front door to flip off the OPEN sign. Ah, they were closed I guess. I suppose that is why the employees seemed annoyed.   I have an idea for this place. If you want to close at a certain time post a sign with your hours. Also, remember to turn off the OPEN sign. Finally, if you don't want to serve someone just let them know. It will probably annoy them, but they might try you again in the future. With thousands of restaurants in the city life is too short to put up with an attitude of any kind.

The is four buffet stars. I hold buffets to a lower standard. I'd say it is three regular restaurant stars.   This place is a cut above the average Chinese buffet. I'd say it is a step below Hong Kong Buffet in Ahwatukee, but cheaper. It is at least three steps above the buffets surrounding my house in Tempe, and not too much more expensive. They recently lowered their dinner price to $10.95--our two drinks plus hot tea was only $2 and our three year old ate for free--or maybe I should say he played with his food for free. Total bill for three of us--$26 and change plus tip.   Lots of seafood (for my wife) including crab and crawfish, but still lots of other stuff (for me), and enough unusual dishes to be interesting., It is a nice looking place, very clean. According to the notice near the front door, they applied for a liquor license, so maybe beer and wine will be coming soon. Service was very good indeed--plenty of refills. They also have one of the better sushi selections I have seen in a buffet, and a now-typical Mongolian BBQ area, only with more stuff than most I see.   In all, this is one of the better Chinese buffets I have visited.

Since my beloved cigar-home Cubanos mysteriously and suddenly went out of business I have been casting about for a new place to sit every so often and try a new stogie. This will, alas, not be it.   Nothing wrong with the place really. They have a nice, large humidor with all of the things you would expect. The service was okay. The guy seemed a little suspicious of me. Maybe because I told him that I was a former Cubanos customer and he thought I had bad-luck cooties. Or maybe because he caught me talking to one of his customers in the humidor (not my fault, the guys asked me for my opinion on some cigars and I have him an honest answer). In any case, he was not too talkative to me.   This is also another one of those places with a membership cigar lounge for the beautiful people. I hate that, so I subtract a star. The conversation, from what I could overhear (no one was talking to me, the new guy), centered around sports, which is typical. The thing I loved about Cubanos was that the owner was always an interesting conversationalist. Very hard to find.   In all, probably a better store for you than me. Check it out if you are in the area. It is too far of a drive for me based on my experience today.

I hate to do this. What's worse, after this I have to write a similar review for Andrew's Barbeque, which I visited a few days prior. But really, the barbeque scene in Phoenix has improved over the years and places need to step up their game to succeed.  Most barbeque fans know that Rudy's opened in Chandeler near I-10. The week they opened we excitedly piled in the car and headed down to try it. I noticed this place then. It was about ready to open and I thought to myself, "building a bbq place right next door to Rudy's is either the dumbest thing I have ever seen, or the most brilliant.' Think about it, if a place has good barbeque they could easily steal away some of Rudy's business. Rudy's is, after all, known for its extremely long lines and wait times.   The reality is Can't Stop Smokin's just does not taste very good. Bland. No flavor. Their sauces are not even that good. I did like the collard greens, but the rest was about what you would expect if you bought barbeque at a supermarket. I had Pete;s Pick, which includes pulled pork, beef brisket, hot links, and ribs, so I got to hit all of the main items. Maybe I just tried them at a bad time?  Service was decent. The place is clean and bright. Lines are not long usually, since everyone is next door at Rudy's. The only thing wrong is the food is not great. But in a restaurant, that is a pretty important factor.

Wow...here we go again. We have yet another good Indian restaurant.   Like the last couple of places I reviewed, this one also had great service with a very hospitable owner. Also like the others it looks to have been remodeled, with the high ceilings and new tables.   The buffet had many choices, also like the other new places, and everything tasted great. Mostly this is the stuff you would expect, but there were a couple of items new to me--chili chicken being one of them.   I'm excited to see the quality of Indian lunch buffets rising. I just hope they can all manage to be successful in the new, very competitive, environment.

Really great sandwich. I had "The Phoenix," which consists of cubed rib eye, roasted green chilies, jalapenos, carmelized onions, and a VERY nice roasted chili mayo. Philly? No. Who cares? Not me. This was a perfect Phoenix version.   I work over on Central and turn left at this corner every morning, but did not notice it until today. It is in a small, two-store strip mall behind an old convenience store. Parking is tight in front, but they have more around back. Inside is nice, especially compared to the rough-looking surroundings.   Service was friendly and quick. Even though you order and pay at the counter, the guy working checked to see if I needed a refill and brought my stuff to the table.   I'd just about go five stars, but it is a little expensive. My bill was just under $13 for the sandwich, onion rings, and a drink. I left a tip too, taking the total higher. A little high for lunch, but still a place I'll visit again.

Well, well...the standards for Indian cuisine in the Phoenix just continue to rise and rise. Just a few short days after discovering Matka, I tried Chutney's, which is located in the space formerly occupied by Pasand.   For those of you who have been to Pasand, just forget all about that. The new owner has gone all out on the new place. The furniture is all new, new bar, new kitchen, new buffet table. Everything is shiny and clean and just a little upscale-looking. But for the three or four people out there that actually read my reviews, you'll know that ambience and décor are at the bottom of my list when it comes to judging a restaurant--service, flavor and price are what is important. Fortunately, Chutney's has all three covered in abundance.   The owner is a great host. For the people who look a little lost, he quickly steps in, giving them a tour of the buffet, which has a very generous number of selections (I have not been here for dinner yet). Several times during our visit he stopped at our table to let us know of something new coming out of the kitchen, or to recommend some dish or drink. Our waiter was also very good, knowledgeable and attentive. Pretty good considering how new the place is.   The food was great. My wife and I are still debating which we liked better--Matka or Chutney's. I guess the only solution is to each Indian twice as often and go back and forth between the two. I mentioned the selection--very large with six chicken dishes alone, not to mention numerous veggie selections and lots of other stuff.   Price is about what you expect--$10.99 per person and $6.99 for kids. I'm not sure if price and selection varies on weekdays--we visited on a Sunday.   I live just down the street from this place. I intent to be a very regular customer.

I really want to write a longer review about this when I am not sick (home today), but I've already waited too long to put up a review for this new business.  Recently my wife and I noticed this place while going for dim sum at C-Fu Gourmet, which is in the same strip mall. We noticed their lunch buffet was substantially larger than other Indian places, so we vowed to give it a try.  Like I said, more detail later, but you have got to go try this place out. They have around 19 items on their lunch buffet for $6.99 all you can eat. Their weekend buffet boasts 27 items for only $9.99. The food was up in my top three favorites in Phoenix and the service was excellent. I talked a little with the owner and he told me that everything is made fresh everyday. Nothing is left over for the next day. The dishes changed daily. You really can't go wrong here--the cheapest, the best selection, and one of the best flavor-wise in the Valley. All things considered, this is my new favorite.

I see a lot of really great reviews here for this place. I think it boils down to the type of place you are looking for. My thing is finding little family run ethnic places where the food is good and the prices low. Service is important, but decor and ambiance are non-factors to me. On the other hand, if you like average food served up with old, piped in mariachi music and fake, yet expensive, Mexican decor, this would be your place.   My family, when they visit from Indiana, like it just fine. They enjoy it. But to me the food was bland to average. We had a good variety of stuff on our first visit--I had a build it yourself combo plate and Carol had a shrimp dish, can't recall now which one. Average, as I said. The salsa was awesome though. Second visit, salsa still good, other stuff, still average.   Considering how slow they were when we visited, the service was not great--slow and only marginally friendly. This was on both trips--the first time when it was just Carol and I, and a second time when I went with my family. That second trip it seemed like maybe the owner or a manager was waiting tables and building up a pretty bad attitude about.   Bottom line...if you  like the real deal take a pass. If you don't mind this style, give it a try. It looks good and is not terrible.

This has happened twice now. My son is playing with his iPad. He goes to hand it to someone else and between the two of them they manage to drop it on to the concrete porch, shattering the glass. I have since added breakage coverage to my devices through DirecTV, but before that I had the chance to use Arizona iPhone Repair.   The experience was very good. I walked in, dropped off the iPad, went shopping for a couple of hours, came back and it was done. The iPad 4 screen was $150, but I think the older models are cheaper than that. In any case, way better than buying a new one. The glass looks better than new. Highly recommended.

My thing is finding little family run ethnic places where the food is good and the prices low. Service is important, but decor and ambience are non-factors to me.   Sochu House is the opposite. It is all about atmosphere and decor. Trendy, as they say. But it was nothing I would look for. We went for lunch, so I think the menu is a little different. If you go for dinner your experience may differ. Food was okay--spring rolls good, wings very good, red curry okay. We ordered the spicy lemongrass dish and asked for chicken--which was supposedly one of the choices along with shrimp or fish. The waiter returned to say the chef refused to make it with chicken because it would not taste right. So, we ordered it vegetarian and it sucked. I've had better at countless places in the Valley. I think I should stay away from places that say "fusion," my luck is often bad. Also, I thought prices were high for lunch and the size of portions.   Enough said.

Love it. Love it. Love it. We've already been back three times since we found it.   Others have mentioned the area--not the best part of Tempe, but not exactly Mogadishu either. The building--and I wish I could remember what used to be there--looks like maybe a former Eagles Club or VFW lodge. The inside is not pretty at all, with areas of it looking like my messy house. Floors are dirty here and there. Stuff like that. Service has been good for us each time we have been, so no complaints there.   But who cares about all of that when the food is so good! Finally, Sichuan food that is spicy and flavorful and just superb. Their spicy chicken with pickled chilies might be my favorite Chinese dish of all time--including stuff I've had in China. My wife gets a tofu dish--and forgive me, but the name of it escapes me (I owe you an update)--that she says is the ONLY version she has had outside of Asia that tasted right. It ended a year's long search for her. Even the old standbys like Kung Bao Chicken take on a brand new life. The only dish out of everything that is not superb would be the Dan Dan Noodles--they were merely good.   Another Yelper said something about the quality of the decor and building being negatively proportional to the quality of the food, and I have found this is often correct. This is a good example. Place looks bad. Food tastes wonderful!

I found myself at Burton Barr Library for a meeting yesterday and went to this place for lunch. I have to say I was impressed.  They don't sell by the slice, but they do have 10 inch pizzas. I guess you call this a gourmet pizza, but not in an over-the-top way. I had the Testosteroni and it had pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, onion, and I think it was fresh basil. The crust was just perfect. Well worth the $10.50.  Service was attentive and friendly and the place was pleasant. We were there at 1PM and the crowd was light, I recommend this place if you want to spend a little more for lunch that you would for fash food.
