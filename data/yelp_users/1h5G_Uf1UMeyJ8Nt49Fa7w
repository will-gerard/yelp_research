This would be the first time I'm in Vegas venturing into Chinatown and I was pretty impressed.  This place is spacious and clean.  The staff are very aggressive with their water and service is fast.   Ordered the seafood egg noodle soup and it had a tasty broth.  The portions were average and I was full at the end. The fried egg rolls were nice and hot and served with lettuce to make it a wrap.  The fresh veggie roll was also good too.  The soy sauce that came with the fried tofu wasn't what I hoped for (what I'm use to when I'm at dim sum) but the tofu was good.  DO NOT get the fried calamari - that thing was so oily and fried in some old oil so it was just NASTY!    They also have a variety of drinks and beer so you're good to go on a hot day!   Bottom line: My friends and I are a fan just not the calamari.

For a Chinese restaurant, this place is OVERPRICED.  Like seriously, there are plenty of places that serve the same food for a lot less.  I'm not impressed.  We ordered the clams sauteed in black bean sauce.  It was tasty and as expected.  it was a good portion. Then we had a veggie dish and then some noodle dish.  All in all, the food was pretty good, but the prices are just a little ridiculous.    The service is pretty much like many other Chinese restaurant, as expected.    Bottom line: I think I would look at other options before I come back here for their prices.

Just got off the plane and needed some lunch. Heard this was a pretty good spot. NOT!  Maybe because I'm spoiled from the Bay, cuz this right here is nothing good aside from the AC.   The egg noodle seafood was a mere two bites. The so-called seafood was a few cuts of the fake crab meat, 2 shrimps, and 1 shrimp cake ball. The broth was subpar.   The worst was the lemon-grass chicken. It's not the chicken steak or thigh that I'm used to that is grilled. This was all chopped up in pieces and it tasted and looked more like Kung Pow chicken than the real deal.   Bottom line: disappointed! Not returning even if I was in the area.

You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.    Food: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.    Service: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.  Bottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!

I think people who give this place any more than 3 stars is a joke and you clearly need to get out more to other establishments.    Food: It's ok and can do the job if you know what you're picking at.  I got the prime rib and had him cut thin slices for me and it was a perfect medium rare.  The crab legs should be easier to eat and cut for you, but it's not.  The wonton noodles were garbage.  There is definitely a huge variety, but like I said, you gotta pick and choose wisely!  Gelato station was a hit though among our crew.    Atmosphere:  Nothing spectacular.  There's a bar in the buffet that you can have drinks ordered.    Bottom line:  This use to be the happening spot like 10 years ago, but it's gone downhill.  I mean, you get what you pay for in Vegas.

This place is pretty consistent.  But let me warn you, everything seems to come in EXTRA LARGE portions.  I guess that's kinda standard in AZ.  Everywhere I've been, everything seems super-sized.  It's a bit much and overwhelming in terms of their portions.   Service/Atmosphere: Went there after I landed Friday night.  The place was not crazy packed like I remember when I went there on a weekend...usually there was a wait.  The main room was very loud and a table in the back room was much quieter.  Service is on point and they are really nice and attentive in terms of refills and such.   Food:  -Blue Point Oysters - didn't quite taste like blue point and kinda larger than I expected, but of course, still fresh and tasty!  Not as sweet as I think blue points should be. -Texas Redfish Pontchartrain topped with a savory crab and shrimp in a brown butter wine sauce over dirty rice.  The portion was enormous.  The fish lacked taste and it was only saved because of the sauce.  The dirty rice was awesome. -Lobster in a Pot - it's a mix of lobster, corn, sausage, onions, and potato.  The broth was tasty and the lobster was tender and not overcooked.   -Sampler dessert trio - I wasn't much of a fan, but the creme brulee was ok.    Overall: I've always enjoyed this place and the food is consistent and I've always had good service when I come here, although my friend has experienced both.  It's a redo for me here.

This place is always a return for me whenever I'm in town. I have to say, I'm never one to really like chain restaurants, but this is an exception!   The food is generally really good and portions are just enormous. I like this place cuz of the oysters. Was a little disappointed that they didn't have the Blue Point, but for $5.99 a dozen for the Texas Gulf Coast was a score. The gumbo is always tasty. If you feel like sharing among others, order the Jumbo size that's not on the menu! The Greek salad was a good touch to all the heavy food that is served there too.   One side note for the bartender. When serving a shot of whiskey or anything else, please don't add crushed ice. It sorta ruins the drink. I'm just saying. You don't serve whiskey with crushed ice.   Bottom line: repeat for sure!

I'm from the Bay Area where we have some very great Vietnamese joints so I'm kinda bias when it comes to other places.  We went there for brunch on a Monday and there was just one other table eating pho.   The pho broth was good.  The spring (fresh) rolls were average.  The wrapper could have been softer.  The coffee was nice and strong and they make it for you at the counter so none of that fresh drip at your table.    Overall, the place is clean.  The food was good, but one minus on them was that they are a bit on the pricier side!  If I'm back in town, I'll be back.

Checked in on a Sunday afternoon after the crazy Cinco de Mayo and Mayweather fight.  We didn't have a problem booking a room at the last minute.  So my 5 stars was basically for my boy, Sean,  at the front desk who graciously hooked us up to their Penthouse Sky Villa Suite on the 33rd floor with a panoramic view of Vegas.  Not sure why, but he felt like we deserved it and YES, we did!    The room: Our 1400+ sq ft suite  had  1-bedroom, 1 1/2 bath, dining room, work station, living room, and floor to ceiling windows.  Lights, temperature, curtains were all automated and operated on their touch screen control.  (That touchscreen was a bit slow to react).  One push of the "Good-night" button and everything was shut down for you including the curtains.    The bathroom had a huge tub, a separate shower that also doubled as a steam room, a heated toilet seat that also doubled as a bidet, and a huge double door wood closet that just screamed luxury.  Robes and slippers for you to use.   Room service was awesome.  He set my breakfast up just as I wanted, with a view of the city.    One con: Static!  Literally when I was messing with the bed sheets, you can actually see the static sparks.  If you wear those slippers around, beware, cuz you're gonna get shocked!    Bottom line: $275 a night that got us into the Penthouse Suite...ummm, no complaints there!

The layout of the restaurant is very open.  There is an open kitchen in the back where you can see through the glass.  It's nicely lit and the decor is simple.    Food: My friend had their 4-course tasting dinner for $85.  We ordered the chilled seafood sampler platter for appetizer and I ordered the sturgeon.  Let me first point out that the bread was amazing!  The corn bread muffin was especially moist and tasty.  I can't even imagine how much butter that little nugget had, but it was so damn good!   Now my sturgeon was a bit on the fishy side.  I wasn't blown away but it had a unique flavor.  I couldn't care for the artichoke that was on the side but the squid ink risotto was BOMB!  My friend's tasting dinner was good. He really liked the Farmer's Market Salad.  He described that as every bite having a different taste due to the ingredients in the salad.  The 2nd cours of salmon was good but nothing to be blown away about.  The hollandaise was a bit much.  They ran out of lamb chops for the 3rd course, so he opted for the halibut and it was yummy.  It was different since it was cooked with braised short rib on top.  It was unique.  We weren't impressed with the dessert - and actually I can't even remember now - so that's how good that was - Not really!  Bottom line: If you wanna shell out some decent dough and get a good meal, this can be the place.  It was also very convenient since the sky suite entrance was literally across from the restaurant, making it a breeze for us to just take the elevator down.  Vegas has a lot of high end places, so take your pick.
