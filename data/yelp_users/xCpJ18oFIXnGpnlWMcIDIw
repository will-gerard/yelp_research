It is stupid for this place to close at 12 o'clock. And on top of that not have enough cashiers to get the people out if you're going to close at 12. And changing over the money at 12 is not convenient for the customer. And it takes one cashier to open up six self checkouts instead of having one cashier for one lane for 30 people in it

I called and place an order for delivery it took an hour and a half for delivery once I get my food my orders was not complete their solution for fixing the problem was bringing me out the sauce that was missing and that's going to take another 20 minutes so by then my food will be cold. Don't get delivery for this place.

This place is amazing I eat here at least twice a week the food is always fresh. And very reasonably priced I do recommend the half and half with rice and salad
