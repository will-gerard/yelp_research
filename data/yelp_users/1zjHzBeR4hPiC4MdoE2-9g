They should rename this store to everything but tops! What a waste of time. They had no matching bikini sets. Service was terrible! I had to interrupt the owner & employee's conversation just to get an explanation of their ridiculous rack organization. "Sorry to bother you, but can I get your help?" I'll never be back!

They must have been reading their reviews! Food was outstanding and service was very attentive! We went on a Saturday, mid morning. They were busy but got us in quickly and brought coffee even quicker (hallelujah!) The waitress recommended the strawberry ricotta pancakes and they were delicious. The waitress was attentive glancing over regularly but not interrupting the conversation. Great experience, we will be back with friends & family!
