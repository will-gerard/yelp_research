awful!!!!  i dont know why i keep coming back!  as in all the other reviews, the lady at the front desk is rude, mean, disrespectful and just not a nice person, definitely not the 1st impression you want as a business!  not sure why i didnt think to check Yelp sooner, i usually only use it to find food.  every experience i have had at this Dr. office has been bad, this review should be -stars. so this time I show up at 10:30am for my appt, which is at 11am, only to be told by the lady at the front desk my appt is tomorrow.  normally i may think that maybe i made a mistake, but everytime i set an appt it is for my 1 day off, monday, not any other day, plus i set the appt 2 hours after another appt i had the same day, and i went to that appt today, it wasnt scheduled for tomorrow.  so i try to explain to the monster at the front desk, in which all i hear is fill out this slip, and go sit down while you fill it out.  i was able to get an appt for the same day, i only had to wait till 12:45, if you remember i got to the Dr. at 10:30am, oh and i forgot to mention this was all just to get the medication refilled that i have had to take for the last 5yrs everyday for my thyroid, because they will not allow refills over the phone from Pharmacies, they make you come see the dr. every 2-3 months to get refills.

Let me start by saying the staff was GREAT!  our server was awesome, hostess was great, and the backwaiters were all great!  The food itself was dissapointing.  We started with the smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail & stuffed mushrooms.  The smoked salmon was ok, but barely any smoke flavor came thru, shrimp cocktail was average, nothing special, and the stuffed mushrooms were very bland, just not much to them.  We then had the lobster bisque, wedge, french onion soup & caprese salad.  The lobster bisque was very good, the wedge was also good, the french onion soup was average and the caprese salad was disappointing.  All of the steaks were good, not great, but good, and at $50-$60 a steak, I do expect my steak to be as good or better then I can make at home, but again, wasn't blown away.  The sides were disappointing, the mac and cheese was a big lump of cheese, not a creamy consistent sauce, but a stuck together lump of cheese & noodles.  The crab & Nocchi side was bland, no flavor, tasted like flour & sauce, garlic mashed potatoes were good.  Overall not what I expected from a steakhouse that had been reviewed so well.  As someone who cooks all the time, I may be a little critical, but when I spend over $400 on dinner, I would like to be blown away, and I wasn't, not even close.

We ordered 4 sandwiches, Meatball, Chicken Parmasean and 2 of the pesto chicken hoagies.  The sandwiches were delivered, they were supposed to be hot, but were luke warm at best when they arrived, very bland, no flavor, and to make things worse we paid $45 for the 4 sandwiches to be delivered, but that isn't the worst part!!!  The next morning my son was violently ill, puking all over the place, and I will spare you the details of everything else, but he had food poisoning.  I called Streets of New York to tell them about it, and was met with a rude manager that questioned me to death, and didn't think that it was their food that made my son sick! Maybe if I didn't work as a chef, then I may have had it wrong, but I told the manager that I worked with food on a daily basis, and she still seemed to think that either I was making it up, or I was jsut wrong. Very, very , very disappointed, will never order thru them again, and I would advise that you check your food if you order with them, make sure you don't get sick too!

first let me say that the owner Oren is a stand up great guy, one of the friendliest I have encountered at any restaurant!  The BBQ here is better then any BBQ i have had in town, and as someone who does BBQ, i like to think i have a pretty good prspective!  Brisket is super juicy, great smoke, great smoke ring, really great crust, its money!!!!  Ribs are awesome, nice and meaty St. louis ribs, smoked pork & chicken were also on point!!  i like to mix their sweet & spicy sauces together and dip all the meats and lick my fingers to the bone!  Naked BBQ is a legitimate 5 star BBQ restaurant here in the valley, i cant say that about any of the other BBQ joint in Phoenix.  my hats off to you guys, great job!!!!
