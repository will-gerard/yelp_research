I saw Rheannan at Salon Intrigue and she is the best!!!! She was super friendly, gentle with my sensitive head, and clearly very knowledgable about hair. She took the time to understand exactly what I wanted before jumping in. She did a technique called hair painting. I love it because it looks super natural, like my hair is sun kissed. THANK YOU RHEANNAN!

This location is completely understaffed and unprepared. I was never picked up by enterprise so their tag line "we'll pick you up" was entirely invalidated. I waited more than 30 minutes after my appointment until my dealership actually drove me to their location. I then waited another 30 minutes to secure a rental car with a practically empty gas tank. Compared to other rental car experiences, this one was subpar to say the least.
