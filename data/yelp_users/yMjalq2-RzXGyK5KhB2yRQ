I was excited to take my young son to visit Signh Farms after reading the reviews - but after today's visit, I won't be going back. The parking lot is overcrowded and could use an attendant.   I pulled in and found a couple walking to their car. The man motioned to me that he was parked over in this direction and I pulled in behind him to wait for him to back out. In the meantime, we waited for 4 or 5 cars to pass by and back out in front of us. Shortly thereafter, they backed out and i pulled up to turn into the parking spot. From the other direction, a woman pulled in, nearly hitting my car. I honked my horn, but she pulled in and proceeded to get out of the car. When she got out, I rolled my window down and said, "Did you not see me here waiting for this parking spot?". She replied, "Do I look like I care?" I replied, "You nearly hit my car trying to get into your parking spot." She then replied, "Have a nice day."   If this is what I have to expect once I get inside, then no thanks. I was looking for a nice, relaxing experience on a beautiful Saturday morning, this ended up being a complete waste of my time.

Great pizza...and you won't leave hungry.   My wife wanted to try a new pizza place and we read the raving Yelp reviews about Big Boys and thought we would give it a try. We each ordered a slice, which equaled about 3 pieces of any other local pizza. Great crust, thin and chewy.   Super friendly staff and lots of specials to choose from. Have been back twice since our first visit and I am counting the days until we order more Big Boys Pizza!
