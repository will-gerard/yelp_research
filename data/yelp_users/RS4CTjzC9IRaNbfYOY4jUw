Just returned from my last visit to Cafe Boa.  Let me describe the experience.  I arrive and am seated outside.  It's lovely out, so, that is a bonus.  I sit down to a filthy, paper menu.  Not so good.  Then I pickup my silverware wrap off my bread plate and the plate is dirty.  The waitress asks me for my drink order and I ask for sweetner with my tea.  She brings my tea and 2 packages of sugar.  I tell her I don't want sugar and she gives me some snide remark about it being the only thing they have and "it is all natural."  All I wanted was some lousy Sweet'N Low.  Never got any bread and the waitress never noticed that I moved the dirty bread plate to the side of the table to get it replaced.  Oh well!  Next I order a salmon caesar salad.  It arrives and the salmon is dry and flavorless.  I'm done.  The best part about the meal was the company.  I won't go there again.  I continue to wonder how they stay in business??????

I had the second and last of my bad return experiences at Dillards at Paradise Valley yesterday.  I was returning a very expensive pair of blue jeans and was greeted by the rudest sales associate of all time.  The return policy is clear that you need either the sales receipt or the original tags.  I had purchased the jeans a week ago in Houston and in the packing and unpacking process I had lost the tags.  The sales representative basically told me I was an idiot for not keeping the tags and tried to tell me she was going to give me $29 or a $128 pair of jeans that I had the sales receipt for.  I've never in my life had such an awful return experience.  I got my money back, but will never make the mistake of shopping at Dillards ever again.  I hope they become a casualty of the down economy.  They don't deserve to be in business!

Just returned from hopefully my last ever visit to La Bocca.  Let me describe the experience.  Arrive and am seated outside.  It's lovely out, so, that is a bonus.  I sit down to filthy, paper menu.  Not so good.  Then I pickup my silverware wrap off my bread plate and it is dirty.  The waitress asks me for my drink order and I ask for sweetner with my tea.

Had my first black tie (the Night of Gold Ball benefiting John C. Lincoln Health Foundation) event at the new Sheraton downtown. They did a great job. The space is fantastic, the food was above average for mass production and the service was excellent. I would recommend this venue to other charitable organizations.

Went there once not sure I'll ever go back.  Pros:  Good steak and great bar.  The Cons list is long:  you have to pay $6 to valet your car to spend $400 on dinner, everything other than the steak was mediocre at best, server failed to bring the right scotch 2 times, server failed to bring the detailed receipt which proved he brought the wrong scotch twice, the bar is just like Marco Polo a meat  market for both blue hairs and hookers.  I was shocked such a new place had such a clientele out of the gate.  Don't waste your time if you want a great meal and service.  You won't find it here.  Overpriced and over hyped.  They need to change their ways quick to make this steakhouse a winner.  I'm going back to my old favorites......
