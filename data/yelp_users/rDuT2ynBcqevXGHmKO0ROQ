Upon walking in with my family we come a across a sign that states "wait to be seated", while waiting we see the employees gathered around having a grand time not taking the time to greet nor seat us. A huge turn off for me, after seating ourselves we see the same issue happening as other patrons wait. Extremely rude, and I will never be back.

Heard about this place from a friend. This hidden gem in Old Town is a great break from the typical Scottsdale sports bars. Great date spot or night out with the girls. I had the Glazed and Confused grilled cheese and the sangria (which is amazing)!!! Definitely will be back. Plus the owner is super nice.

Such an amazing experience,from the staff to the ambiance. This is one of the most sophisticated nail salons I have ever been too! Not to mention their use of natural products is great for people with allergies (like myself) . Highly recommend Herbal Nail and Spa! Be sure to ask about SNS.
