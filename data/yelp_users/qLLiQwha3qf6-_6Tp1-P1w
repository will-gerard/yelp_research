I LOVE this office. This is what medical care should be.    On a referral, I went to this office for a bad case of plantar fasciitis. Dr. Beecroft is wonderful. I was squeezed on a Friday morning.  Thank goodness because I was in a lot of pain.  It was recommended that I go for ultra sound therapy a few times a week. I was dreading taking time off work to go since doctors office are notoriously running late.  This was not the case here. I NEVER waited for more than a couple of minutes before the tech took me back. My appointments were quick and enjoyable. The staff is considerate, kind, efficient, and fun to chat with.  I always looked forward to visiting. :)   A couple of weeks ago, Dr. Beecroft said I was good to go. No more PT, no more visits.  It was truly sad to say good-bye to the staff. They are the best.  I will CERTAINLy go back when my feet ail me again.

Can't believe I'm the first to write a review. I love this place and especially Jody! I've been going here a year and I am never disappointed. Jody is patient and listens to what I want in color and style. She is an absolute perfectionist and has cut my bangs very patiently so they are feathered and light and just the way I wanted them. Recently I was stopped in the mall and was asked who cut and colored my hair. That has NEVER happened before.   If you want an attentive stylist who is awesome at color, go here and ask for Jody.

I crave their hummus so HAVE TO go regularly. Try the jalape√±o cilantro version for a taste bud explosion. Falafel PTAs are great and for me Pepsi products are the icing on the cake.

I have been taking my poodle/terrier mix to Shelly's for a very long  my 10 year old dog is not the easiest to handle but the do so well with her. She comes out looking and smelling great.  Shelly's takes her on time and their estimated time to get her out are pretty well on target. I have used several different groomers in the shop and each has done well. I recommend you give Shelly's a try!

This was not my first visit to the offices of Ford and Caserta and no, it was NOT the first time there was surly staff. They are nice enough on the phone but in person, not so much. I too arrived at 7:45 for an 8 a.m. appointment. The receptionist did not look at me. She just handed me a clipboard and asked for my insurance card.  I dutifully filled out the papers and returned them to her and then my wait began. She was rude to other patients too. They really need a new receptionist who is empathetic or at least smiles. I didn't want to be there at 7:45 either!   At 8:20 she notified me that my doctor called in and was running a half hour late. Are you kidding me? By the time of his expected arrival, I would have been waiting an hour. My time is valuable too! I understand emergencies, but if that was the case, then I think I would have been informed of that.  I didn't wait. I have responsibilities too.   I made another appointment but probably won't keep it. I'm still annoyed by this and don't think my insurance or I should have to pay for sub par service.  Sorry, docs. Get your act together and maybe your patients will be content.

The venue is gorgeous. Very ornate and timeless. This was the second event I attended here. Really stunning outside. Comfortable seats inside.   Came for an ASU event and the only negative was the surly usher who made us sit closer to the front. I was startled that she would speak to patrons in this tone. I'm sure she is a volunteer, but seriously!  (OK, OK, enough of my rant.)  I'd love to come back and see a concert or a play. It's very convenient and close to lots of restaurants and parking. We paid $10 to park in an underground lot which is about the going rate for downtown event parking.

I attended a friend's wedding here last night and I have to say, this is a lovely, lovely venue.   The garden area was beautiful, the pool was glistening and the restrooms immaculate (and plenty of stalls for us ladies!). When the afternoon sun became very strong, attendants came out and hoisted umbrellas into place.   While photos were taken we enjoyed appetizers and drinks in a lovely area where guests could mingle. I've been to weddings where we sit around waiting for the couple and have been starving. Not the case here. The wait staff was attentive and professional.   The open area where the reception was held was tented and lit to perfection.  Now about the food....THE best wedding food I've ever tasted. OMG, the mashed potatoes were delish as were the filet mignon and the green beans. Kudos to the bride and groom for picking a great menu.   Finally, there was plenty of convenient parking. A real plus!    If only I could convince my hubby to renew our vows, this is where I would celebrate. Maybe an anniversary or retirement party instead?  I highly recommend this venue for any classy celebration. :)

Not impressed AT ALL.  I was actually ignored at the counter when I needed help.  The rude sales girl turned her back and walked away.  A very haughty store. Go there if you enjoy that kind of service.  Will tell all my beading friends to not waste their time going there.  Too bad for you...I had lots of money to spend today.

Had a wonderful dinner with my daughter here tonight. Great service by very professional and accommodating wait staff. Soup was delicious as was my chicken parm...so huge, I couldn't finish it. Yay! I get lunch tomorrow!    Brandon was our server. I totally felt catered too. Not cheap, but well,worth it   Loved the atmosphere and the funny owner. He wasn't bad at all. Relax people, it takes all kinds to spin this great  world. He was funny and sccommodating.

Had a great experience here with the Gabe. Sent groups of students to have full color posters printed using our account. The process was very smooth and Gabe was very accommodating. We made all arrangement through phone so I didn't even have to leave the office which is a big PLUS in my book. He saved me tons of time.   I couldn't ask for more more professional courteous service. The posters were beautiful and nicely packaged so they would not get damaged. When we discovered an error on the invoice, it was quickly rectified.  Will I use them again?  ABSOLUTELY!

I have used Trophy Den a few times over the years for work related awards. They are awesome, especially when it comes to customer service.   I tried to work with another vendor out of state using their online service. I was told pricing was great. That was not the case and their customer service was awful.   Trophy Den to the rescue!  My budget was met and they had exactly what I needed. John took great care of me and communicated throughout the entire process. Product arrived before my requested date as well.  I couldn't be happier and will continue to give them my business.

First, I'm not a sandwich person (must still be shell-shocked from all those brown bags in high school).  The guy at super sign in the same shopping mall suggested I go there to grab a quick lunch.   Waited in line too long to order. I an attempt to practice patience I decided to Zen and go with the flow. With order finally placed I waited and waited. The line grew steadily longer and still there was only one cashier and one prep person, or so it appeared.  I checked my email and Facebook and still no sandwich. Hmmm.  So much for grabbing a fast lunch.   Get back to the office which is only 5 minutes away and dug in. Uck. The turkey was bland and the bread soggy. Not very appealing.  The ice tea was delightful though. :)  Maybe it's what I ordered or my basic instinct to not eat sandwiches but it's a thumbs down from me. Must say that the person taking orders was friendly and did his best. I wish he had help during busy lunch times.

I've lived in the Valley for years and everyone raved about the pricing and the great bargains to be found here. I won't be on that bandwagon. This was not our destination, but since we were in the area, we stopped by.    Wow! What a disaster this store was. Too many people rummaging through a huge bin of underwear for a bargain is not my idea of how to spend an afternoon. I'd rather pay full price than have this experience again.   I only saw dated merchandise and banged up purses. Some of the wallets were nice. I was tempted for a moment, until I saw the lines.   I won't be shopping here any time soon. Off to the mall I go!

Terrible, terrible service. Will not go back. It wasn't even crowded for Saturday Brunch. We waited and waited for eggs and after 45 minutes left. The server checked back with us once to left us know our food was on the way but it never came. Hugely disappointed. Will not recommend to friends and won't take my out of town guests there either.

This was my third or fourth time eating at Chelsea's Kitchen. Never a bad experience and always come away feeling satisfied with my dining experience.  I met a friend here for dinner on a week night. When I arrived, not crowded. Fifteen minutes later, CROWDED!  Get there a bit early to avoid the wait.    I had the ahi tuna tacos and my friend had the brussel sprout salad. The ahi tuna tacos came with small corn tortillas and a very fresh kale and quinoa salad. The tacos were very, very good. The salad had a very light vinaigrette dressing which was very tasty. I'm no brussel sprout girl, but her salad looked might good and healthy too!  As for the parking -- there is a parking lot, but it gets filled fast. Park in valet and tip the guys generously then you won't have to worry about finding a spot. Trust me.  It's easy and they are FAST!   I plan on going back to try a brunch someday. Can't wait!

I'd really like to give this place 2.5 stars because service was good; food...not so much. I hadn't been to any PF Chang's location in more than 5 years and after my meal here, I remember why.   A large group of us went out for a colleague's last day. The waiter was efficient and took our orders quickly. He even asked if we wanted separate checks and was very accommodating. No problem there. He was great.  I ordered the lunch size chicken satay with the side salad. Peanut sauce came on the side. The first piece chicken was tender but the peanut sauce was under whelming. I kept dunking just to be sure I had enough sauce on the chicken but it was still lacking in flavor. The second piece of chicken was full of fat and just had a weird texture. I didn't eat it. On to the side salad which should have been fresh and crispy. The menu promoted it as "fresh" and it was anything but. It was wilted and not appealing at all.   Lunch with my colleagues is always fun, but I'd like to get my money's worth. PF Chang's was a disappointment. Will likely be another 5 years before I try it again.

Stopped in for a cold brew after a out if town trip. HAPPY HOUR success!  Good, attentive service and fresh food. My salad was perfect.  A nice place to hang out and visit with friends.  Could have stayed a few more hours!  There are TV'S on the wall for game watching. I have to keep that in mind once football season is in full swing.   MACs has a different vibe than loud sports bars and I get the feeling most of  patrons live in the neighborhood. I will be going back.

Just finished celebrating our 28th wedding anniversary at Firebird's. What a great, friendly, comfortable atmosphere for a celebration of any kind. Also awesome for any meal!  Servers are professional and friendly. We told our server that it was our anniversary and she made it special by putting two candles on our dessert. I thought it was very sweet and thoughtful.   I love the interior too. Wood and beams with an inviting feel. The bar is awesome and makes you just want to hang out there for hours. I love all the glistening bottles on the wall.   On to the food: My husband's meal was OMG delicious! It was pasta with braised beef, spinach, cheese sauce with a hit of spicy. Comfort food at its finest. I had the filet kabob with roasted veggies and mashed potatoes. It was very good, but I should have been more adventurous in my selection. Like I said, my husbands dish was to die for.   Dessert was just as yummy as the meal. Try the crime br√ªl√©e cheesecake!  So danged good.   As we were getting ready to leave, the manager stopped by to say hello. Nice touch! We will likely go back in a few months when family is in town. This is a special occasion place for us and we love it that way.

I've been taking my beloved poodle/terrier mix here for just about 10 years. Now we have a new pup and they are both "patients." The office staff is wonderful and they know me and the names of my pets. (Okay, well maybe the use the computer to identify me, but I love walking in and they say hi to me and the dogs!) The office staff is genuinely friendly and efficient.   Both Dr. Loeschen and Dr. Stanat are wonderful and give plenty of TLC. I don't know how Dr. Loeschen calms my jittery 10 yr. old, but he does. He is so gentle and honest with treatment and I never feel like I have to do everything he suggests right away. He let's me know what can wait and what is essential for the well-being of my pups. Under his care we have been able to avoid pesky bladder stones that plagued my older dog.   Take you pets to VCA Elliot Park and you'll be in GREAT hands.

We are thrilled at the results of our new patio!  Lenny saved our backyard from a disaster. After having our pavers installed  and ripped up twice, we called Kona Land and Water Escapes to help.    They specialize in large jobs but we experienced the same level of attention and care on our small job. Lenny brought his crew out and they meticulously measured and leveled out the area. This guy knows what he's doing!  He is just not talk, he delivers.    We now get to enjoy a lovely patio area in our backyard. Lenny to the rescue!!!!

I am brand new to jewelry making and this place was recommended by a co-worker.  This place is wonderfully organized and has beautiful beads of all varieties.    For me the most impressive part is the service. The young woman behind the counter answered my ton of questions, asked if I'd signed for the newsletter so I can get my discount coupons and more!  What surprised me was her willingness to share her newbie experiences as a jewelry maker and her genuine encouragement. I would have ordinarily felt a bit insecure in a new crafting environment, but felt so at home here!  I plan to take classes too.   Keep up the great work Bead World!

Love, love, love Pappadeux.  Only my second time here and both were on Fridays to connect with friends. Both times we had EXCELLENT service with fantastic and attentive wait staff. I don't mind paying a bit more when I get quality food with great service. We enjoyed music on the patio with a pretty cool local singer/songwriter.  The vibe of Pappadeux is unique with families, couples, and large groups all appearing to have a good time.  I had grilled shrimp with saut√©ed green beans and my. oh. my... was my mouth was happy!   Last note:  I never have dessert. The dessert tray was toO unique to give it a pass. The King cake cheesecake was to die for.  you should order that!

I've come here pretty often since we discovered it a few years ago. This is as good as it gets. Why? The beer is danged good and so is the food.  SanTan Brewery is a happening place and one of my favorite in the Valley. They can accommodate both large and small parties.   The first beer I tried was the HefeWeizen. On man, I thought I had died and gone to beer heaven. I'd pretty much been a Corona girl and didn't venture any further until I went to SanTan. It goes down so smooth. Then, one night I was at another establishment and they had SanTan on tap and Mr. Pineapple was recommended by the server. Holy cow!  I feel in love instantly and now Mr. Pineapple and I "date" on a regular basis. The brewer was imaginative and creative when he dreamt up this guy. He has just a hint of pineapple and I have to say, I crave him -- I need him!  When I can't make it to the restaurant, I get him in the can and he's equally delish.   On to the food --- My fave is the Margherita pizza. I can eat the whole thing in one sitting and it's not a itty bitty pizza. It's bigger than my head!  Basil, olive oil and tomatoes come together on fresh dough which is perfect.   We've enjoyed the hummus and Southwest fried chicken both are outstanding. My husband recently ordered the smoked meat which is a sampler of sorts with brisket, sausage, and pulled pork and better than any Texas BBQ (sorry Texans!). Could not stop picking off my husband's plate. Next time will likely order my own.   The place gets pretty crowded and can be loud. I don't mind, I feel like the patrons are my people!  We like to go late afternoon for dinner and brews. On special days, like Christmas Eve, we've made reservations through Open Table.    You'll enjoy your visit and be a regular soon too.

Updated look!  Food is awesome. Give them a try if you haven't already. They installed an ice tea dispenser!  Service is good. Food is very tasty and good sized portions. Price is right! Two cheese enchilada, beans, rice, small side salad for less than six bucks. You can't beat that!!!   I love seeing this place busier and busier each week.

I've been an ASU employee for ages and eat here a couple of times a month. I've never, ever had a bad meal. In fact the meals are fresh, unique and for the most part very healthy.   I'm not a salmon fan at all, but because I'm trying to eat more healthfully, I ordered the salmon, veggies and fingerling potatoes yesterday So delicious and filling. My only issue is that the fish was cooked with lots of oil. Of course my food was awesome but as a Weight Watcher, I should have asked how the fish was cooked. My bad.   They typically have burgers, pizza, and a gluten free meal option. And oh!  They have sushi too.   Don't be thrown off by how you're seated and how you order. Just do this: Walk up to the desk and give them your party count. You'll get a table number.  Overhead you will see the day's menu.  Next walk over to the prep area where you can get a visual of the food for portion size, ingredients, etc.  Don't dawdle! Head to the registers to actually place your order. Show your table number. All members of your party will use the same number.  Get a drink and find your table. Easy peasy, right?   What I like most about engrained is that beverages are included and the servers bring you a bowl of tasty chips as you wait for your meal.   If you're visiting ASU this is THE place to have lunch on campus. Trust me. You can relax and decompress. The place does get a bit crowded by noon so try to get there early.   Bon appetite!

My husband took our four year old fur kid here to get a much needed teeth cleaning. Prices were less than quoted by our long time vet. So happy we found Niki's place. My husband is uber picky and he thought Niki's was great. We will definitely be back and not wait so long between cleanings.   Have already referred a few friends here. I only do that when we get amazing service and results!

Been here twice in two months. Not impressed. The barista, who was working in the back, acted like I was interrupting something very important. No smile, no eye contact...nothing. She was bordering on rude.   The  coffee is just so so and waaaaaaay to expensive for mediocre coffee. Even though I work close by, I won't be going back.  I'm thinking they won't last there. It's been empty each time I've gone.   Too bad, we need a good coffe place that's close by. Maybe I better get a Kuerig.

I love Dr. Carlsson and his staff!  I just got my third pair of glasses from him recently and each and every pair has been perfect.  Being a progressive lens wearer they can be tricky to prescribe.    Dr. Carlsson takes his time with patients and very thorough. He is also friendly and highly knowledgeable and professional. We tried several pairs of contact lenses last year before deciding that my eyes were too dry to wear them for long. He even took me outside to test distance!  Who does that at a mall store?    As for the staff...they are truly amazing.  All are courteous and sweet!  When I walk in the door it's as if they are expecting me and know me by name. I never feel like I am intruding on their day which is what I get from many other retail stores.  Keep what you're doing ladies!  Eyewear selection is GREAT.  I have purchased cool designer frames and their prices are in all ranges. I never feel like the staff is trying to up sell me me either.  No pressure sales is shopping happiness!  My only suggestion is could they please be open on Saturdays, or at least one Saturday per month like my dentist???  This is not a deal breaker for me, however.  Bottom line, go here if you want personalized, friendly service in your eye care. I know I will be going here for years to come!

Went on a Saturday night and there wasn't a teen in sight...well behind the register only. Nice, clean atmosphere and I loved the hi-def TVs on the wall. We finished watching the game while enjoying our treat. Also the roll up "garage door" mentioned by another reviewer is def a plus!  Imagine enjoying a Zoyo on a sunny day with the door open. Pretty sweet!    For those us us always watching our calories, carbs or whatever, rest assured there are non-fat sugar fee options. Mine was only 70 calories per serving!  E N J O Y!

I have to agree with the ratings already posted here. We just completed a very interesting dining experience and one that I hope not to repeat any time soon.   First of all there was no greeting upon entry. It hard to identify where we should position ourselves to be seated since the host's podium blended into the nondescript interior. We were seated promptly but I was struck at the lack of any semblance if design at this establishment. I consider myself to be a minimalist, but decor here is too sparse even for me.  There was nothing relaxing or exciting about it.   I knew the experience would be rocky when the paper menu of appetizers was placed before us.  Really?  Paper menus? Way to make a first impression. Then, when the dinner menu was delivered, one page went to my husband and the second page went to me. It took us a few minutes to realize that we each had half!  Why we only got one menu for a party of two is beyond me.   My main criticism is that the place lacks a vibe. They are going for a theme, but it's not well demonstrated. Ok, there is a martini shaker on the table but how does that tie into shots? The server explained that the "shakers" they serve are basically mixed drinks.  What???  Your server should be able to adequately explain your concept and inspire guests to order something fun and unique.    The food wasn't bad. I enjoyed the complimentary hummus. The bruschetta was tasty but the bread it was served on was too thick.   I had to chuckle when the server asked if he could remove any plates and I told him he could take the center plate and my husband's. He then swooped away my plate while I still had bruschetta in my hand!  Rookie mistake.    We witnessed two couples leave -- one when they were ignored and never got seated and the other after examining the menu. Also a family of three left after being served water.   Last,  as we departed no one said a word. No, "Thanks for coming." or "see you next time." Nothing.    My advice?  Hit up The Vine across the parking lot. They say  "hi" and good-bye."

I SO wanted to like Culver's. After finishing up an evening meeting we walked over to have dinner. We placed our order quickly and then went to fill our drinks. I know it was just after the rush hour but the drink station was a mess. There was liquid all over the place and straw paper wrappers everywhere.   The food was just so-so. I had a sour dough burger. The bread was mushy and the burger tasteless. Did not like the cheese curds at all. My husband had the fish and he said it was average. For what it cost, I'd rather go elsewhere else.   One thing I loved, the quotes on the walls were nicely done and inspirational.  Good job here.

These are the things I hate: car shopping, clothes shopping, and finding a new stylist.  But thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I found Monica, my new stylist! What a great experience.   On my first visit Monica spent time with me talking about what I wanted in a new cut and my daily hair routine. As I work in a professional environment, I want to look polished each day. Monica recommended a tad longer than chin length, side bangs, and a few layers in the front. Since I'd resorted to a chain place (of the Edward Scissor Hands variety) while I was searching for a new stylist, the back of my hair was a disaster with dense, choppy layers.  Enter Monica!  She worked wonders during my first cut. The result was cute and easy to care for and she tamed the old layers. Today she did highlights and the same cut. I feel fabulous and my hair is shiny and manageable.   If you're looking for a stylist who listens, is easy to talk with, and fun, you need to see Monica too. She's awesome!

Today was my first visit here. I've worn glasses for years and have gone to optometrists and ophthalmologists, but it was time to see the latter.  I found this from my insurance website and Yelpers definitely contributed.   As a new patient, there was the usual paperwork. I was told in advance that my appointment would be longer. Great. I was ready. Waited only a few minutes to be taken back. Had a great tech you did all the preliminary exams. She was friendly which helped me to feel comfortable. She had a pretty good sense of humor and we chatted about our respective universities who are rivals.   The offices are nice and the staff in the front office were efficient and pleasant.   Saw the doc for about 15 minutes which is cool because I only needed an eye exam. He was professional and courteous. Nice handshake too. He explained things thoroughly and I was good to go. Overall a good experience. Glad I found a place where I can feel cared for.  My peepers are happy too.

Great service and tasty, yummy food. I've never had a bad meal at any Pita Jungle location. It's hard to pick a favorite dish. Some things are no longer on the menu, but I've asked for them anyway and they have always been accommodating. I kinda love that in a restaurant.  Our server today was great. Ask for Mariah. She'll hook you up with beverages to go and is fast and sweet.  :)    Take all your out of town guests here. Each location has different decor but the food remains consistently good at each and every one.  Love me some Pita Jungle!

Had a very enjoyable breakfast here. The low carb breakfast was filling and tasty. Service was incredibly fast and efficient. We hung out on the patio for a good hour after we ate and no one encouraged us to leave. Yes, it was hot and patrons were mostly drive through but still, no one bugged us.   Customers kept coming out with this delicious coffee/shake beverage but I never got a chance to ask them what it was. I will definitely be back for breakfast and order that yummy looking concoction.

I'm new to working in the downtown Phoenix area.  For weeks I'd seen a happy fella waving at me with a big sign flagging cars into Red Hut. He's there EVERY day. Having beat the traffic one day and arriving downtown early, I decided to treat myself to a latte. It was delicious.   I love this place. It was clean, the service was great and the staff friendly. I've stopped there several times and I get the same quality service. It was fast in and out and when you're on a schedule it's perfect. I'm yet to try a breakfast sandwich but that's next in my list.   I think what I like most is the guy with the sign. Even when I don't stop, he waves and smiles. Maybe he does that to all cars, but I think he saves a special wave and smile for me. Great work happy fella!

Loved this place. Comfy and relaxing. Great service with attentive servers.  They put up with my friend's zillion questions about the food.   Happy hour was great and the specials were very tasty. Don't know how they cooked their chips but they were amazing!    Go!  You will love it!

I'd really love to add another star here. The only thing that is lacking is a bit more ambience. I'm no interior designer so I can't really help. I wish it were a bit more homey, that's all. Maybe flowers on the table, table cloths?   So that being said, the food is awesome, large portions and very, very fresh. The service is fast and pleasant. You can build your own omelette but be sure to ask them for light oil and no cheese if you're watching your calories. I forgot to do that and my first bite was yummy good. Then, oh.  No wonder. Butter! Don't get me wrong, I love me lotsa butter, but not when I trying to lose a few LB's.  Did I eat it?  You betcha! I had eggs white with asparagus and avocado. So good.   Also the beverages are  HUGE!  See my pic and how the drink sizes are compared to a pack of Splenda.   Bottom line, great service, yummy food. And plenty of parking!

Ok truth time: I didn't buy anything at this store.  BUT, my experience was amazing!!!! Why?  The owner provided very detailed information about many of the brands we inquired about. She was friendly, smart and oh so knowledgeable. I like that in a business owner!  The variety of shoes in stock was overwhelming. I could have spent so much money here (but my husband was with me).  Shoes are comfortable, well made, and colorful for comfort shoes. The assortment blew me away. I will go back for some cute summer sandals. Not taking my hubby though. ;)

As promised, I made the trek to Shoe Thrill sans the hubby. What I thought would be a looooooooooong process because their selection is huge, was not long at all. Why?  It gets down to great customer service.   I knew what I wanted when I went in. Cute comfy summer sandals in black and in a neutral color. Because of a foot ailment, I have to have supportive arches and a comfortable shoe. I walked in and scoped it out. My eyes were bouncing everywhere. Too many beautiful shoes to adore. Focus, focus, I said out loud.   The sales girl, Hannah, asked what I was looking for and she came back with a stack of shoe boxes. Wow!  Has she got great taste!  The first pair I tried on I loved. It's a strappy black mid heel with soft leather and amazing support. The next one I tried on was a pair I had admired the year prior. I snagged both pairs. Perfect fit on both and oh so comfortable. I'm in shoe heaven. Not sure I need to go anywhere else for shoes ever again. Yes, the can be a bit pricey, but if my feet don't feel good, I don't feel good.   You're gonna love this place!  Good quality shoes, beautiful store, amazing staff.

Just returned from a mani/pedi. Good experience and I will wholeheartedly agree with others that the staff is friendly and skilled. Diana did my pedicure and Q did my gel manicure. My toes are perfect as are my finger nails. Diana matched my toe color to my fingernail color practically spot on!    The Express pedi is $18, so not bad. That does not include any sort of leg massage, which I miss. Next time I'll pay the small cost and upgrade so I get my much needed leg massage. I'm a working girl, so this kind of pampering is a must!    It's been a while since I had a gel manicure, so kind of lost track of how much they cost. The total seemed a bit high, but since I got great service, I'm going  to return. After having dealt with snotty manicurists in the past at other establishments, I'd rather pay a bit more to get top notch service.   Keep it up Lashes and Nails, and you'll do great here!

Tonight's goal was to indulge a little and then head to the Orpheum Theater for an event. We stumbled on this gem my husband had heard of before. I was a bit cynical since I wanted to eat across the street. There was a small patio outside but we wanted to be indoors.   The minute we walked in I knew the hubs had made the right choice. It's our kind of place. There were booths, a very nice area, wood in enough places to add warmth and a cozy factor. From the get go, it just felt good to be there.   Our server was quick to come over and offered a sample of a craft brew from a local brewery I'd never heard of. Tasty!  We were a bit early for dinner so we ordered from the lunch menu. Nice variety here. Salads, sandwiches, and more.   Full disclosure: I am NOT a sandwich person. Not at all. Burgers yes, sandwich no. But, the chicken sandwich on a ciabatta roll with avocado, bacon and some delicious mayo concoction on the side was absolutely the BEST sandwich I've ever eaten. I am serious. Every mouthful was pure goodness. The best!  My side salad was fresh and the bleu cheese dressing and large chunks of cheese which I promptly savored. Yum!   Another server tempted us with the bread pudding. Hmmm...do we dare? Remember I said indulgence was the goal, so glad we caved. Deliciously decadent and we loved every single bite.    I think The Kettle Black will now have to be on the list where we take out of town guests and it will be our our regular list too!  Great service, cool place. A new date night place for us for sure.

Had dinner with my work team last night. Overall a really good time in a fun, unique environment. The decor is different with wood ceilings that look like they are reclaimed  from another building or ordinal from the prior establishment on the same premise. Regardless the ceilings, light fixtures and furnishes made for a comfortable vibe. Very enjoyable.   We ordered a few appetizers to start. I'd never had fried green tomatoes before last night and wow, what a surprise! They were more delicious than I had imagined. Next came an interesting platter of pickled vegetables, various spreads including a yummy one with bacon and caramelized onions. My absolute favorite were the pickled carrots. After that came warm, delicious corn muffins. I happen to love corn bread so these were right up my alley.   As others have said, there were long-ish gaps between courses, but no one at our table seemed to mind!  Service was great, our server was attentive and  so willing to explain each menu item. Every employee we talked with was accommodating and professional. Great job here!   I had the Mac and Cheese but must say its not the best I've ever had.   My biggest disappointment of the night?  My dessert was so small  and I shared it with my hubby. Dang!  Should ordered my own....Next time!    Would love to go again and support our local entrepreneurs.
