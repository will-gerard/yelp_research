Can't say enough good things about Sushi Ko. A regular group from work and I go at least once a week and sometimes as much as 3 times a week for lunch. The specials are great and the quality of the food is always excellent.   If you are looking for a glam-type of sushi bar that serves dozens of western rolls then go to Ra.... but if you want tasty, reasonably priced AUTHENTIC sushi then Sushi Ko is the place!

I used to go to this Chipotle a lot, but not after today. Pretty much the worst experience at Chipotle ever... First, when we got there the line was already to the door and the manager didn't even seem to notice. He finally came over to the line to help the crew out after we'd bee waiting 20 mins. Only all he did was tell them to speed up and then he started rushing the customers... next we ordered 4 bags of chips with salsa and we got the salsa but apparently the cashier didn't hear because she didnt charge us for them. When I pointed out that we didn't get our chips she made me wait while she rang up two more guests... and then she rang me up... which surprised me since I thought she had already charged us... now any chipotle I have ever been to before would have just given me the chips and not made me wait further and since she asked me what type of salsa I wanted with my chips I figured they were responsible for the mistake not me... but I guess this location is not as interested in good customer service.  And she also failed to bring me the tortillas that I ordered with my bowl like she said she would. Last but not least both the dining room and the bathroom were filthy... like I said, not going back to that location again.

I also had PLO pools referred by my home warranty company. I called just before the 4th of July weekend because my Salt Cell is not producing ANY chlorine despite running almost 8 hours per night.   The technician that came out to look at my system had no experience or knowledge of the Salt System installed on my pool. He tested my water and then told me that my chemicals were not at the correct levels and that my salt cell was fine. Then he proceeded to tell me that his electronic test equipment had not been calibrated recently. REALLY?!?!? How can I take anything he says seriously when he admits that he is using his tools improperly?  He also told me that since the water exiting the salt cell was "cloudy" that it is functioning correctly and he promptly left.  I discussed the issue with two other pool professionals and was told absolutely that without a test of the cell there is no way to know if it is working correctly and that there should be some amount of chlorine produced even if other levels were not correct. My assumption is that the contract provider collects a flat fee for each service call they close, therefore the more calls they take without doing anything the more money they make. That's when I realized why the service tech was so curt and quick... He couldn't get out of my yard fast enough, from hello to goodby could not have been more than 10 minutes and he never did more than glance at the salt cell or controller, which is the part that he was there to repair...  Luckily I called my Home Warranty company and they are sending out another company. Stay away from PLO Pools at the very least they lack professionalism and courtesy, but most important to me they seem to be incompetent!

Ate at the Angry Crab but alas they don't have key lime pie, that's where Grassroots came in... hurried over just before closing and had the most amazing key lime pie ever... definitely check this place out! It's kind of hidden over by the Trader Joe's so don't be fooled by the Camelback address...   If the pie is any indication the food here is amazing. The pie crust was the perfect texture and the filling was nice and creamy in the middle with bits of lime throughout.

First time here and I don't know why I waited so long. The happy hour menu is awesome and it's 3 pm to close every day! I'll be coming back here often.

This place is great. Would have been a 5 but they don't have key lime pie... shame on them. Highly recommend Monday's when they have the mixed bag! Just don't wear your best shirt as you'll probably wind up spilling something. Btw, Cassie is awesome!

I tried this place today. Very disappointed. The food was very salty and way over-priced. I won't be going back anytime soon.

I've been here several times and the food never ceases to amaze. Definitely try the crab cakes and whoever makes those cookies with the salt at the entrance should get a Nobel prize!
