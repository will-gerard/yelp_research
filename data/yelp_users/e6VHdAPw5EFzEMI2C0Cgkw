I've never had a bad experience with this company until today. I filled my pet's prescription 2 days ago thinking it would be arriving today. I checked my account and noticed that I had not been charged for her medication. Mind you, my dog has severe allergies and her medication needs to be taken every day at the same time. I am down to her last pill as I was under the impression that I would have her refill in today to continue her on her regular routine.   I called and checked today on the status. The tech that I spoke with placed me on hold because he did not see that it had been filled. He stated he was going to ask the previous tech why it was not filled. He came back to the line to tell me that it would be filled and out today!   Ummm, what happened to the confirmation I got from the tech a couple of days ago? Why did she not fill it and tell me that it had went through the automated system when I did it? His answer, "She doesn't know." Really???   There was an offer of an apology, but the least they could have done for their mistake is waived the shipping fee. Nope, nothing offered. I asked when I should receive and the latest will be Monday!!   So my poor pup has to go 4 days without her medication. Thanks for nothing as this is her relief from her allergies.

I am a fan once again. After speaking with the Director, he was absolutely understanding, empathized with my situation and changed my outlook on my experience.  It was a relief to know that they do indeed take these matters seriously and will listen to the service call between myself and the technician and ensure that the proper feedback and training is given to the staff to prevent a similar situation in the future.   I commend Diamondback for their quick response and prompt action they took to get her prescription to me in a timely manner. Her medication made it the very next day! Boy was I relieved as well as my pup!   Thank you again for hearing your customers out and providing excellent customer service to continue the relationship. I have confidence that if anyone ever has a concern, they will be sure to make it right!

Literally as good as it gets! I've been wanting to jumpstart my fitness and was looking for a different way to do so other than going to a regular gym where I felt intimidated and lost.  A friend recommended me to Chris at Pro Edge a few months ago and I've been hooked.   I always attend Blackout Boxing and it absolutely is the best workout I give myself. Although it's a group class, Chris makes you feel like its one on one giving each of us individual attention to help correct our form or to be that voice to tell you that you can do this!   Chris' success is your success. Everyone is helpful, motivational and its just an all around fun, welcoming environment. He knows exactly what to do to push you, and shows you that you can go beyond your limits. I've also done buddy training which was killer! I survive each time and always walk out of that place wanting more and knowing results are on its way.   I highly recommend Pro Edge if you are looking for a boxing gym where you not only get an awesome workout, but a place where you have a fit fam to encourage your goals and take you to the next level every time.
