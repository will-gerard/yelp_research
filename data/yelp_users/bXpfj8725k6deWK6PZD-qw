Excellent food , however,  I wished the corned beef was homemade and not from a can. My friend had the Denver omelet which he says was first rate!

Food is outstanding, however the last time I was here, the girl behind the counter thought it was necessary to be playing heavy metal music at the volume level of 12.... VERY unprofessional of her, but the food is

First off their prices are more then the big milk producers sell theirs at, however we are talking FRESH milk here it is local and family owned. What a great experience we had on our first visas and yes we are going back can't wait to make fresh butter and buttermilk for pancakes!!!! Milk is delivered 3 times a day from their own farm 3 miles away which is so cool.

Horrible service the waiter can not do two at the same time. Not too sure what the problem was with the waiter but the dude had to be on drugs. Drink service, was weird, he had a hard time bring 3 ice tea's and one diet soda. He brought the diet soda but didn't bring the ice teas, then it took 15 minutes to get the ice teas, when we ordered our food, we wanted appetizers BEFORE our meal,  which was explained to him but NO, he brought my partners lunch out and that was it. We sat there wondering what was going on, after 30 minutes (I went to the hostess stand and ask to speak to the manager) after 20 minutes the manger finally came over (BTW we sit had not received the rest of our food OR drink refills) we told the manager was had happened, we got a new wait staff who was on top of it, and in about 15 minutes our food started to arrive. After this service and food was excellent...  The Manager comped our meal.  This all took place at 1130am on a thrusday afternoon.

I'm not a vegan by any stretch of the imagining but a co-work told me about this place. So I gave it a try and wow amazing good. The green curry is outstanding.  Does this mean I'm giving up meat or fish NO but it has opened my mind to some healthy food that has wonderful flavor.

Saw this place on Diner, Drive-In and Dives. So a bunch of us went there for lunch. It's funky alright but not as cool as I thought. WAY over priced food, $3.50 for 8 oz bottle of diet coke. The slider sampler platter was $12 no frys or chips... The Mac  and cheese muffins were over cooked and dry. Service, well... You order your food and pick it up yourself, our parties food were ordered at the same time but there was a 15 minute lag time between orders. Being completed, unacceptable. I was embarrassed for suggesting this place, there is no air condition and being in a warehouse it was just too hot.

OK so what did I think of this place. Well first off after reading these reviews I thought, doesn't sound so bad, so what the hell. So tonight my partner and I went there for dinner!  OK this place says its a Seafood Buffet, someone says its like the Rio SeaFood Buffeet  in Vegas, HARDLY! The Rio is in a completely different and A LOT better.  This place is hugh, and if you do not get there by 6pm forget finding a placeto sit  its packed. The food was just OK, when you walk in you see this very large boat serving center, that is where the Sushi is at, nice selection for a buffet, but then again not the best,  They have a section that is like a BBQ area where you pick what you want, and the cooks will cook it for you, a nice selection. They have a meat section its OK, the beek is over cooked, as well as the chicken. They have the same selection of the chinese buffet as any other Chinese Buffet in PHX, in fact there are better places.  There is a lady who brings the food as well as broadcast to the cooks in the back what is needed, the speakers are so loud in the kitchen that it sounded like a train station anouncements in a chinese train station, This same lady "bumped" into my many times while she was bring out the new food, I understand that she is in a rush, but when there are people in front of me who is overwhelemed by the selection of food I have no place to go,   The atmosphere is nice, very airy but very loud, when you have a large gruop of people trying to talk to each other, it gets very loud. The wait staff need help, they take forever to clean away dirty plate and to get refils of your drinks.  So, lets talk about price....  Total for 2 adults with drinks (non alcholoic) was $39. WOW, I couldn't beleive that price. Yes, they serve alcholoic drinks, that is a nice part I saw.  Over all, we wont go back to it, for that pice, I would rather eat some place else.   Save youself from this pace and go some place else.

So where to start, my partner and I arrived about and signed in, there was one couple in front of use. The hostess asked if we have been here before, which we have not, she explained that we can help ourselves to water, ice tea and coffee. We got our drinks and sat and waited. More people arrives, the hostess sat the couple before, then started seating people who arrived after us, after the second couple behind us was seated I asked the hostess why my partner and i where not seated before others. She informed use that we had been seated already, however, I had to point out to her that we have been sitting right there (pointing to my partner) She insisted twice she sat us, so I asked her where she sat us, and then realized she made a mistake. Once that was taken care of and we were seated, the service was good, a little on the slow side, but the food was excellent, on par with The Farms but at a third of the price. We will be going back...

I heard so many good things about this place and was very disappointed, first it was VERY expensive to eat for two people, better value and just as good BBQ next door. This was my first time here, and was over whelmed with the experience the workers didn't make it easy I felt rushed ordering and when I would ask questions, they would roll thier eyes....

So found this by accident was hungry and went in. The place is clean and no fishy smell they charge by plate color and each plate has either 2 or 4 pieces of sushi   This great so you can try many different types prices range from $1 to $5 I didn't see any $5 plates most where $2 or $4.  Lunch could be had for $10 easy.   My lunch was $15 and I had 6 different items including gyoza.   I live at the base of SoMountian and will make the trek back here.

Busy lives we all lead I have driven past this place at least 100 times and of course have said we need to stop here so today we did and it was better then expected. The building has so much history the server Jaycen was excellent. The tacos are more like street tacos wish they were a little bigger but the flavor they pack is over the top. I had the Peking Duck, Al-Pastor and Thai snapper all three I would get again.  If you are looking for some place unique and looking for Mexican this is the place.

This is our second time being here for the money you get plenty of food and the wing sauces they have are good. Overall an excellent value, will come back again. The mango habanero sauce is my fav than comes the teriyaki  forget the Cajun sauce.

Never used a service like this and after looking at them all on Yelp and getting quotes, I choose Happy Junk Removal, John was in communication with me with in two hours of me sending my info. We set a date and time, John was stuck on an earlier call, but was very communicative about the delay, he arrived at my home when he said, very personable, polite and took away the mattress and box springs. I highly recommend them !
