Dr. Patel is a great doctor, and very informative. Best doctor I've ever had, no crazy wait times either. I strongly recommend checking him out if you are looking for a doctor.

Wonderful environment to watch a game, great ambiance, although it did take a while to get acknowledged when we sat at the bar. Try the Ruben it's outstanding and prices are reasonable. If you have to eat near the convention center and are crunched for time, it's the perfect spot.

Awesome food and tons of great beer to chose from. I am a big fan of this restaurant and have frequented the restaurant many times, and haven't ordered something I didn't like yet. Everything tastes amazing, but one suggestion would be to get something other than the street tacos... they are generic and not worth the price in my opinion. Other than that everything is great and I really recommend trying the Firecracker chicken wings.

Great beer and great dining experience. I ordered from their healthy menu items and my dish came out super salty but my wife's was good and so was the kids meal I got for my son. The Jeremiah Red is a great beer that they brew and I would definitely suggest you try it.

The food here used to be so good. Unfortunately, the food had suffered over the past few year and is saltier than a salt lick. The food has zero Mexican sophistication and has lost its luster. The margaritas are terrible which is sad because they used to be really good. Now they are WAY too acidic and taste terrible. Owners really need to change it up!

Let me start by saying, the food is some of the best mediterranean food in AZ. I've had the lamb, chicken, gyro and greek salad and it's all amazing. Their homemade hot sauce just takes it over the top and is completely mind blowing. The owner is a really nice guy and welcomes you with a big smile and warm compliments every time you come in.   I would eat at Spices at least once a week if not more if I could, unfortunately the prices are pretty pricy$$$ for the area. If this restaurant was in N. Scottsdale I would understand, but this area of Chandler especially during the day is working class and wants a good meal under or around $7. I have a hard time getting out of there with a meal under $12 with my hot sauce- not including drink. I probably go there once every 3 month/ sometimes more... but usually not due to the fact that I'm not looking to spend that much at lunch time. If there was a lunch special at $7, I think the crowds from the surrounding offices would keep Spices packed and would make up for the cut in prices. Just a thought but it would definitely prompt me to eat there more often.  If this restaurant was Chipotle style (at least at lunch). Where you could walk down the line and say what you wanted- I think this place could give Chipotle a run for their money.    Either way, I hope Spices stays open for a long time as I enjoy the food tremendously. It just won't be as often as I like.   Opa!

Don't go here! The sales guys are complete slime balls! The service sucks and the wash is even worse. I watched the girl wax my car, then clean my wheels, THEN clean my interior windows and leather seats all with the SAME rag. I now have a waxy residue all over the inside of my windshield.   Not to mention that they slopped Armorall all over my car, so now there is greasy patches all over my seats.   To add insult to injury the sales guy sold me on the $50 ultimate package. I know it is normal and customary to haggle so I did and the lowest he said he could do is take $5 off... I tried to do better and he swore up and down that, this was the best he could do. He then walked over to the machine and printed out a ticket for my was + $5 for "washing my floormats" which is included- then handed me a $10 off ultimate car wash coupon. The slime ball could have given me the $10 off coupon but instead tried to milk me for an additional $5. I asked the cashier if that was normal and she just rolled her eyes and agreed with me that it was shady.   Beware of this place... I wouldn't go back.

I ended up going to Airpark Dodge Chrysler Jeep who gave me an outstanding deal and honored their word. They told me what they could do and couldn't do and didn't beat around the bush. I worked with John Patrick who goes by JP and he was a straight shooter from start to finish.  If you go there ask for him, he's the man. Easy to work with, laid back, straight shooter, not pushy at all.

This bar has so much potential, but fails to capitalize! I ordered a margarita which was probably the worst tasting margarita I've ever tasted. I then had to wait for close to 20 minutes as bartenders walked by and ignored me before I finally was able to exchange my drink for a beer- which by the way I was charged the full price of the margarita ($8) because the bartenders were too lazy to fix my order. Oh and I didn't even get an apology and the bartender seemed burdened that I was asking for a replacement. The crowed was a odd bunch off people and I could tell that most of them were not from Desert Ridge but probably from the west side. A lot of older douchey guys who think their still 19. It's a total Affliction bar. People reading this will know what I'm talking about.

They were very friendly, showed up on time and worked quickly to get the job done. I was happy with their overall service and will use them again in the future.

Weak! I'm standing in line 15 minutes after  the show was supposed to start... Not happy... Hope the show is better than the venue.

This was my second time trying the restaurant and unfortunately will be my last. From the moment I sat down the venue seems dark and dingy like an outdated sports bar (this bar would be a great candidate for the shoe Bar Rescue), with the smell of spilt beer from the night before resonating from the carpet. Today is St. Patricks day yet they only had two servers/ bar tenders (had to make their own drinks/ run their own food/ refill drinks/ answer the phone/ take to go orders/ and cash people out), terrible management mistake for a busy holiday like SPD with a name like Beef 'O' Brady's. I ordered an Arnold Palmer and for got how bad it was the first time, and got the same rancid moldy flavored drink. I'm not sure if they don't clean the iced tea machine or if the lemonade is bad, but I can tell you anyone with a iced tea was not drinking it (as I witnessed many people with full glasses). All I wanted was some fresh corned beef on a ruben and got, thinly sliced lunch meet that had been grilled to a crisp and then put on greasy rye bread (dripping with grease). Since the Arnold Palmer was bad, I decided to opt for a beer (no Irish beers except for Guinness) so I ordered a Shiner Bock. The beer came out stale/ flat/ warmer than expected. I then returned that beer and opted for a bottled beer...   I was not happy with any of my experiences here, and will never return as this is not my cup of tea. Oh, and by the way it wasn't cheap as the quality of food would have you expect. My tab for a Ruben and Stella was $15 not including tip.   I feel bad for the overworked wait staff as they remained friendly throughout the whole time. If you have taste buds, like your money, and a good atmosphere to enjoy a lunch or dinner; this is not your spot.   Sorry guys, I wanted to like it but I couldn't.   Areas for improvement:  * Heighten the roof and brighten up the place * Get rid of the carpet * hire more staff  * lunch specials (drive in the businesses around you) * Higher quality ingratiates (you should have had fresh cooked thick corned beef on St. Patricks day) * Make sure your beer is being stored at the right temperature and test all your beers for freshness.  * Take pride in your business or you'll lose the opportunity to serve repeat customers.

This is by far one of my favs. For the uniqueness and decadence they bring to each dish. We had a great experience and will definitely be back again!  If you are a first timer try the Lamb Pastrami it's amazing!

What an awesome bagel shop. I think this bagel shop could be the revitalization, the shopping center at the bottom of Equestrian needs. It has a very hip environment, and the owner Ryan and staff are easy going, fun loving people, that help make the atmosphere. Odelay is exactly the type of shop that Ahwatukee needs more of.   The quality of the bagel is impressively crafted, with a crunch to the outer shell and a nice fluffy inside. I go at lunch time and their tea and turkey bagel sandwich is incredible... I've been to Odelay Bagel for 4 days straight this week. If you are a local resident and you want more spots like this, come and show your patronage.   *They are still new and still figuring out processes so the service is a little on the slow side. So don't go if you're in a big rush. But give them some time and they will have that ironed out for sure.
