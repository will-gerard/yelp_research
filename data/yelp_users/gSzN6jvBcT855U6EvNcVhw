Just had a late dinner here. The food was delicious and the service was great and very polite! I had the teriyaki chicken and the flavors were right on point! Great place to go! I'll definitely be back!

WOW this place was amazing! I saw this place here on yelp and decided to give it a try!  I was definitely not disappointed! The food was so amazing. We had the pot stickers, the Penang curry chicken and the basil sauce chicken. You could just tell there was a lot of heart put into these dishes! The chef and I assume the owner came out to greet us and check on how our evening was which was such a nice surprise! She told me about another dish of which is her grandmothers recipe that I cannot wait to try next time. Great food,great service, and over all very genuine place to visit. I think it's my new favorite spot in the area! Please go check them out! 5 stars from me! Well done!

Hands down my favorite spot to get breakfast during my morning bike rides. The No. 44 is my favorite egg frittata. Bacon. Ham. Yummy!!!  I usually get a couple sides to go with it. The kale salad is to die for!!!  Great job ladies!!!

I've been to this place several times now and the service and food is always amazing!  Parking in the area has a bit to be desired but there's many restaurants that I've been to where it is like that.  The atmosphere at night time is particularly great, candle lit and all of the bartenders have been amazing!  If you've never been here this place is one to put on your to do list!  I had a ravioli dish that was to die for, I'm pretty sure all of their pastas are made in house.  I like the trendy appeal this place has to offer!  Job well done Federal Pizza!

So it's hard for me to write this review. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is simply because the service was terrible. The food was amazing!   A friend and I met for dinner at this restaurant last night. Coming from someone like myself who has worked in the industry for over 10 years now I usually myself pretty lenient on service because I know what it's like. However the service last night was just incredibly slow, and we had to ask for things repeatedly. I watched people running around the restaurant most of the night with frantic looks on their faces. I get moving with a sense of urgency but it's best not to show it on your faces. Especially when it wasn't even that busy. It felt like several times our server kept forgetting things. Our soda was empty twice and each time it took a good 10 minutes to get refills, I even asked once if she remembered our sodas and her response was "it's already working". And when we finally got our sodas they were not the sodas we ordered. She offered more chips and salsa and we said yes but they never ended up on our table. The food itself took a long time to come out which made me think she forgot to ring it in as other tables that ordered after us got their food before ours. I'm not really sure how this place trains on service or what their method of service is but I will say it has a lot to be desired. It really does take a lot for me to frown on service but this time it felt warranted. Considering our entire time for two people to have a meal and dessert took two hours, there is something to be said.   Again the food was amazing and I would love to give this place another shot, but hopefully the service is much better than what I just experienced!

I retuned to Joyride earlier this week for lunch with friends. I must say the service this time was much better. The servers were much more attentive. Still a little slow, however it was a busy lunch service so I will not mark them off for this. The food once again was on point and delicious. Much much happier with my experience this time. Good job!

This is a new place in my neighborhood and I've been there a few times now. The food is great and I love the broccoli cheddar soup. The sandwiches are good I just wish they were a bit bigger. I've always had great service from the staff. Very friendly place to go and they offer up some great suggestions when I've been curious to try something.   Great job!

This place gets five stars from me!  I've been there several times now since it has opened!  The pizzas are amazing and the staff is so darn friendly!  They give great recommendations!  They have some pretty amazing lemonade too!  I'm a huge fan of the Tyler pizza!  It's close to my house which makes it almost bad for me because I just keep coming back!  I love it! The prices are great and the pizzas are very flavorful!  Thanks MOD for coming to my neighborhood!
