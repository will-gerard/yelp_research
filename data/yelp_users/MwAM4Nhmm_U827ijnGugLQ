2/2/11- Talk about going downhill! Dunno know if it is a new mgr or what but when I get a roll with my salad and the bottom half is covered in black mold...EEK!   This little stuck-in-the-seventies place is the restaurant at the Belair Golf Course off of Bell Rd. Its really somewhat of a hidden gem though if you're looking for regular ol' American food. Its quiet, has a lovely view of the lake, peaceful, good service and above average food. The breakfast is especially good with the chicken fried steak being my personal favorite. Its actually real steak not some pre-breaded b.s. I like the club sandwich for lunch- generous amounts of meat, fresh lettuce & tomato, hot fries- how can you go wrong? My only reason for not giving it another star would be the decor. Its perfectly fine, I guess. It's clean. Its just so seventies. But, hey, go there to relax with friends, get a drink from the bar and soak up the seventies charm.

This place is just plain nasty. I tried it once and it was so bad that I took a couple bites and threw it out. Fast forward a year or so- I was in the hood, in a hurry for lunch and craving Japanese but needed something quick so thought I would give it another try. Nope, bad idea. Got it to go, went back to the office, took a bite and in the trash it went again. I lived in Japan for years and travel there frequently still. I don't expect this to be up to the standards of what I could get there but I've had school cafeteria Japanese food that certainly beat this.

Really enjoyed the Tokyo Stop. I'm a huge bulgogi/yakiniku fan so the fact that they offered it was a big plus to start with. I'm not huge on veggies in my bulgogi though so thats what cost it a star. It was very tasty however and a large portion. The fact that a Japanese place calls it bulgogi sorta threw me a little bit. Like some others on here I was wondering if it was Japanese or Korean too. I'm going Japanese as the owner & I had a lovely conversation about my time living in Japan. He commented "I miss Japan" and, of course, I said "I do too". Anyone that knows me or my family knows these words are uttered several times a week in our house, usually after waxing sentimental about my beloved MOS Burger. I'll have to try the curry that Matthew K. recommends. Its a tossup as to whether curry or yakiniku is my fav food in the world.

Great atmosphere, great food, and the owners are just as cute as can be! We tried to go to the Taste of Glendale but it was packed and I'm cheap and lazy and didn't want to pay $25 to stand in line. I remembered having enjoyed this place for lunch before so we gave it another try. We'll definitely return. I had the sampler platter (or half the platter actually since it was huge) and my date had the pork goulash. As much as I enjoyed my dish I'll have to say that the plate of porky goodness really stood out. Nothing fancy but very filling and truly downhome tasty (if home is Warsaw I guess). The weather was beautiful so we sat out on the patio w/another couplethat are regulars  and their adorable dogs (oh so European) enjoying pleasant conversation amid the twinkly lights before walking around the neighborhood briefly. Perfect for date night but remember to bring your own wine.

Never have I been so happy to write a review even though I cried through much of dinner. Ok, first off, it is no longer Lily's, its Farjardo's. (or Fajardo's- in my glee I didn't check the spelling). For those out of the loop, a brief history- Lily's was a Glendale landmark in an old house back in the barrio that had been around since 1949. If you didn't know where it was, chances are you wouldn't find it. Sorta like a secret clubhouse. Although it didn't look like much from the outside, it was the inside where the magic happened and I don't mean just w/the food. "Zip" Cipriano Hernandez was the proprietor and, as I always put it, it was like going to your favorite uncle's house for dinner. He always personally came to the table to check on you, remembered everyone and always had a joke. It was a family joint and we quickly came to know and love the rest of them and they watched my son grow up. Outside of the great ambiance, the food was always superb.  The classic mexican food us natives grew up on. I've even commented on another one of my reviews about the most amazing Sunday morning pork chops and how Zip better be waiting at the pearly gates w/one or it just won't be heaven  Thats important b/c Zip lost his battle w/cancer 2 years ago w/i weeks of me losing my mother too. Lily's never reopened and I felt like I had lost not one family but two. But tonight, I gained a new one! Zip's loyal chefs of decades (nearly  30 I think they said) have reopened in the same location with the same menu and the same tastes! Ok, a few things have changed- one, they take plastic now (Zip rolled old school, you see) and they spruced the place up- all good things. But the service was great, my same old blend of pepsi (I'm psycho about pepsi over coke AND it has to be a good blend of pepsi too), the same salsa, the best tamales, enchiladas and the beans...oh, the beans...like chicken soup for some people. I heard other customers come up and be as sentimental as I am about them reopening. Ok, maybe they didn't openly weep as I did but still. Really, if you loved Lily's, go give the new place a try. If you didn't know of Lily's, you missed out once. Don't miss out again by not trying Farjardos. I'll be there tomorrow morning, crying in my pork chop special and loving every moment of it. Update- Check out the article on azcentral http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/2008/11/26/20081126lilyscafe.html

I used to eat at la Perla years ago and it was pretty decent. After my favorite Mexican restaurant  probably in the whole world closed, Lily's just around the corner (RIP Zip. We miss the hell outta you. You better be waiting for me w/one of your Sunday morning pork chops when I reach the pearly gates. It just won't be heaven w/o it) we decided to give it another try. Wish I hadn't. It was ok....but just ok. Like another yelper posted, things had a weird after taste. I can't quite place my finger (or tastebuds) on what it is but there is just something funky about it. I truly wish I could like La Perla but, alas, my search for a replacement to my beloved Lily's continues. Pedro's down the street on Glendale isn't too shabby. Great enchiladas but not the homespun ambiance of Lily's. Sigh. UPDATE- I no longer have to search for a replacement to my beloved Lily's! The chefs of 30 years reopened in the same spot w/the same menu! Its call Fajardo's Cafe now and is the best homestyle Mexican food in town. Great family place. When I was there on Sunday morning there were little kids in their pajamas eating there. Too cute. I love a place I can go to and not have to put on makeup!

Best cheap meal in town...or is it cheapest best meal? Whichever it was delicious for the whole $4.35 it cost me- and that was including a large pepsi. I have a fondness for pork & cilantro anyway but the pickled veggies and the bite of jalapeno made it even better. I don't mind the cash only policy as it does keep prices down. I'll be back!

I love Little Saigon! Heard about it from my doc and went the same night. We've probably been back at least a dozen times. The ambiance is adorable (makes a great date place), prices EXTREMELY reasonable and the food is awesome. You truly can't go wrong but I advise sticking to the traditional dishes for the most bang!

ITs no longer Chanpen. Now its Bangkok BBQ but for some reason it won't let me add it as Bangkok- Meh. That sums it up. Son ordered the yellow curry, which had previously been a big hit at Chanpen. It was only lukewarm, much thinner than Chanpen's version and had big globs of fat floating around on the top hinting at the fact that it had been sitting for a while and had lost its emulsification. I had the thai bbq chicken. Maybe it would have been better if it was even somewhat warm, let alone hot. The man had the bbq spare ribs. Again, not even warm. The eggrolls were pretty tasteless too. There are better thai places in town. Chanpen was one of them. I wouldn't waste my time here.

Oh my! Thank you fellow Yelpers! I love this place! I eat lunch here several times a week now and it is the preferred bakery of my family. I adore the Mini-treat box as I can try several little goodies throughout the day. The vanilla caramel cake is divine. The macaroons are where they really shine though. They are the traditional Parisian style (not the icky coconut ones Americans think of) and are perfect. Honestly as good if not better than some I had in Paris. My only suggestion would be to add more flavors. Just don't get rid of the caramel & chocolate though!  9/1- UPDATE- Went for breakfast this time and it couldn't be much more delicious. My dining partner had the french scrambled eggs. Not only the best eggs I ever had but the table next to us ordered it also and she said the same thing! However, the french toast w/banana caramel sauce- wow! So decadent. I almost felt dirty eating it in public! It felt more like something I should drizzle over my body and have my lover lick off! OK, maybe TMI but you get the picture!

This is one of those places I really wanted to love. Truly I did. I had been looking forward to dining here and finally found the time last week. After reading all the positive reviews on Yelp I really had high expectations so I am hoping I just  went on an off night. The building is lovely and the design was right up my alley but it all went awry from there. First it took forever to get ANY service at all on a night when they weren't even half full. When I finally did get my drink it was too strong to drink. Now, I usually am never one to bitch about a drink being too strong so you know it had to be bad!  The flatbread was awesome and I was all geared up for my porkchop but, alas, was disappointed. It was way undercooked which also gave it an odd, mushy texture. The polenta was basically flavorless. Nothing more than paste on a plate. I will say my dining companions' pot roast was pretty good and my man said his ciopinni was adequate, nothing great, but reasonable. I enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding but have had better. Overall, a pretty disappointing experience when I was all set to give them 5 stars! Maybe I'll try it again someday but with so many other places on my list to try, I doubt it.

Everyone else seems to love this place but me. I had a very strange experience there. First off, the food was average but that wasn't my main problem. It wasn't even that the service was bad just....weird.  I eat at plenty of ethnic places so I'm used to people not understanding English but the gentleman would come to our table, pretend to take our order, leave and then the woman would come back and take it again. This happened over and over- "Can I get a refill on my soda?" man nods, woman comes back and asks what we wanted. It wasn't just us. There was a large family eating there and they were really having problems. The biggest issue for me was when I ordered something (crispy pork skin something or other) the woman looked at my date and said "That is pork skin, she won't like it. She should order something else" Uh, hello? I'm sitting right here! I think I can figure out that crispy pork skin means just that, crispy pork skin! Then I ordered some spring roll thing (Sorry, its been a couple of months now and I don't remember exactly what everything was) and again, she looks at my date and says "She'll have to roll those herself. She should order something else" WTF? Did I just become invisible or what? Trust me, lady, I have rolled plenty of my own, spring rolls and otherwise! It was one of the most bizarre experiences I have ever had in a restaurant in the states. I've been in other countries where I was systematically ignored in favor of speaking to the man I was with but not in my own neighborhood! So, personally, I'll stick w/Little Saigon in a cute little house in Old Town Glendale where I'm dotted on by the flamboyant waiter and the food is better.

I truly don't see the attraction to this place. Like many others, I had eagerly waited for them to open so I could see what all the hype was about. I adore cupcakes, they're my own little guilty pleasure, so I have no issue paying $3+ for a cupcake....if it is well done. These were in no way well done.  They were extremely dry, the frosting:cupcake ratio was way off, the frosting wasn't very tasty either though so it was no huge loss that there wasn't more....just disappointing all the way around. And don't even get me started on the staff and the lack of organization! Let's put it like this- I bought a dozen and brought them back to work. No one was impressed and many (including myself) didn't even finish one. I brought the leftovers home to my husband and child and they didn't finish even one either. With so many good cupcake places in town, why waste time with this one?  8/08- Gave it another try just in case I was being bitchy the first time. Nope. Its them, not me. Bought two more- a red velvet and a chocolate marshmallow. One bite and I threw the choclate marshmallow away. The chocolate was horrible and gritty to the tooth. The red velvet was slightly better but still not very good. Ate a couple bites and tossed it w/over 3/4s left.

I've been going to Sweet Pea since they opened and it is one of my favorite things about downtown. Not only is Danielle, the owner, great but you can tell she really cares about the quality of her products and her customers. I love the anitpasto lunch, especially during our hot summers, but the baked goods are what lure me in everytime. Those pb & j cookies have me addicted and the cupcakes are far superior to most of the other Valley's offerings (especially Sprinkles- ick!). Give Sweet Pea a try. You won't be disappointed!

Another place I just don't get....the cupcakes are certainly no better than anything you would find at your local grocery. They look pretty but the cake was dry and more importantly, the frosting was horrible! Overly sweet and, to reiterate, tasted like something you'd find at a supermarket. Don't waste your time and money.

Best homestyle Mexican food in town. And YES, they do still have the Sunday morning porkchop, just like Zip did, and YES it is just as good. Same recipe, same cooks. The family goes over and above courteous. For your best bet, go for the real food- rellenos, enchiladas, the albondigas on wed is awesome, weekend menudo even better.

Love the Meat Shop! Their pork products taste so much better than anything you'll find at the local grocery stores that you'll wonder if it has really been pork you've been eating before! The rashers are delish, ground pork far superior, pork steaks make great schnitzel...I could go on and on. I will have to admit that I prefer Schreiner's chorizo though. Plus, its a local company so if you're a locavore, this is the place for you.

Wow, a whole list of less than stellar reviews and then two 4-5 stars in one day! By new reviewers even! That haven't reviewed another thing! WOW! What ever could have happened at Mama's to make not one but TWO brand new reviewers feel SO strongly about the quality of their experience there that they would bother to log on and  write a review?   I truly want to like Bitzee Mama's. Really I do. So much so that I went back twice more. I know I can be bitchy occassionally so I try to give places more than one shot w/me. The food was average at best but the service just sucked. There were only about 4-5 tables occupied in the whole damn place but yet service was so bad that the customers, myself included, just started getting up and getting what we needed- refills, napkins, whatever. The one waitress, well, I'm not sure if she is truly just slow in the noggin, on drugs or crazy. I could go on but I think you get the picture. I  hope these other "4-5 star reviewers" had that good of an experience there and not just an extra 15 minute break as an incentive.

Stopped in to get some lunch but it looked a little dirty so I decided to go elsewhere. Good thing I did because after checking the health ratings I am surprised they're still open- a 27!?!? Really? That is freaking scary! No recent award either.

Apparently fellow yelper Andrew and I are meeting in our dreams over maple bacon creme brulee! I'm seriously glad to see that I am not the only one having subconcious yearnings for this lil dab of heaven in a cup! All of the products are top notch though and who doesn'tlike creme brulee? Communists maybe? Chef Eric is awesome and so friendly too.

Yummy, tender, well seasoned chicken, generously sized lumpia, and friendly owners- plus it is in a truck! How can you not like it? A Phillipino news crew was at the Phx Public Mkt  the other day filming them- they're that good.

I love the whole concept of Cycle and Jeff Kraus and his crew hit it out of the ballpark tonight with Experience. I started with the Tiramisu martini which was somehow even more fabulous than it sounds. Luscious and creamy, they (yes, plural) went down too easy.  For a starter I had the frog leg  lollies which would change the mind of any one turned off by frog legs. I could eat those everyday. Perfectly crunchy with just the right amount of sauce and nestled in a pillow of bleu cheese foam- seriously, how could you not like that? I plucked each delicious little morsel of meat off that froggy femur with delight.  My first amuse bouche arrived- a prosseco rimmed in pepper- with a lightness that really helped to set up my next course, the  "Not a Frisee aux Lardon". The peppery arugula and perfectly poached egg was highlighted by the crunchy, salty bits of pig's ear. I scooped up every last bite with the brioche.  Another amuse of peach sorbet and basil was a nice palate cleanser. Dessert was a difficult choice between the skillet cookie with wild turkey creme or the nitro sundae. I went with the nitro sundae and could not have been more pleased. A truly beautiful dish, the crack of the perfect chocolate sphere revealed a gorgeous custard. The crystallized strawberries, caramel, almonds and chantilly finished this dish off with the perfect ratio of crunch  and cream. I hear Jeff is looking for a brick-and mortar place. Even in this tough market, I have no doubt he'll succeed.
