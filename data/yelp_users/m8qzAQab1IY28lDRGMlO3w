everyone has their own story of how/what leads them to bikram.  while i cannot make comparisons to other bikram studios my experience is worth reading/taking into consideration when/if choosing if byi is the place for you.  the answer:  try this place just once (it's affordable).  also, instructors are personable, nurturing and engaging.  Various classes throughout the day allow you to make the practice part of your life as often as you aim for.  indeed it is true what byi's instructors preach:  the hardest part of the class is showing up!  i appreciate this studio so much more than words convey.   even though bikram is done on a group level you internalize the ritual of getting ready for class, being present in class, even leaving class as personal.  i don't mind at all the notifications of other services and class times on holidays during savasana (byi offered classes on Easter Sunday - integral to bikramettes and their 30 day challenges) arriving to class with "spare" time to sit and lounge is not in the cards for me so it is during class time that i'm brought up to speed on what other programs or additional classes i may benefit from.  not once have i ever received the message as an infomercial as the message is short and brief between postures.   I appreciate the honor system when on occasion i've not prepared for class and ran low of hydration.  those few times i'm able to consume first pay later without feeling "marked" or hounded to bring in payment.  just hazarding a guess but IF byi had more room to develop the studio in terms of space then andrea probably would do so.  i'm ok with the quaintness of bathroom space.  if made too spacious a waiting area then it might take away from the focus which is to get in the classroom, set up bikram camp and to wait for it!  byi is functional/practical for the bikrami's wanting yoga.  i need space in the classroom, the diverse personalities of instruction (no microphone please) and consistency in operation. BYI is this place.   Namaste.

uncle sals is nothing special. in fact it's unspecial as in retarded in their customer service. the food is average but service is horrible. we have eaten there twice take out too actually. this evening. my girlfriend picked up the food and was told by the cashier that the salmon bruschetta would not be available so the kitchen left out the salmon and mamagement subtracted one dollar off the bill. complained right then and there. Nothing was offered. This is the 2nd time our order was prepared with errors and not the tasty food we were anticipating.  My girlfriends seven year old daughter with the rest of her school mates could do a better job of preparing a take out meal.  When my girlfriend called Sal's again to complain the man identifying himself as the manager hung up on her.   i just read previous reviews where there is a cockroach infestion?

I take my fur children to bark n babies for their nail trim.  it's always so easy to walk in and be greeted by a genuine affectionate person interested in my dogs names and asking about their welfare.  today was no different. i received great friendly service i'm accustomed to by a younger associate who was friendly and affectionate with my zsa zsa.  then she came back to get jou jou.  i appreciated how after their nail trim the other associate who did the actual nail trimming came out to meet me and comment how lovely my fur children were.  she even showed me pictures of her fur babies.  oopsie, zsa zsa decided to piddle in the floor after sniffing around.  the staff was so kind to clean it up without blinking an eye.  i always tip for nail trimming service.  i'd love it if this place were open on sundays.  the facility is always clean and orderly w/o any expensive dog collar boutique merchandise hanging around.  this place does not accept checks which is fine.  i'd love it if there was fun bathtub to wash your own pets in.  this place is a nice fixture in the neighborhood where i live and i look forward to many more doggy pedicures here.

Consistency every time i return in quality of ingredients, service and taste of food!  how nice that one of the owners recognizes you and comes over to greet you.  the friendly staff behind the counter and nice girls who wait on you when you come to dine in add to the positivity.   my favorite dessert is the yogurt with fresh granola and fruit.  i wish this place were open a bit longer.  i've had most of the entrees, loving the duck salad with the sauce, the fresh greens taste like it's gone from field to plate in the same day. i'll happily give this quaint bistro 5 stars if they stay open longer hours. i feel like this is scottsdale's best kept secret.

Let this review seduce you to the lisa Turley hair studio side.  I enjoyed my outdated hairdo all coiffed up from root to ends with stiff cement products promising to voluminize.  What I didn't love was the mess in my crown that was throwback to metal bands hair. My bad hair behavior & habits of trashing my hair harder faster pussycat more than Vince Neil had trashed hotel rooms was catching up to me.   All the combing & detangling and STILL the painstaking hair loss when I'd finally go to wash my very own motley Cr√ºe I grew out of my scalp.    Enter lisa Turley.  She's a true full blown hair Wonderland taking on way more than a typical hairstylist.  No, no fried ends no asymmertical layers, no previous hairstylist's botched  work.  Worse yet lisa was dealing with a woman who had bad hair care habits that had been embedded at her cellular level.    I was given much more than a deep conditioning & fab layers hair shaping.  I was educated and was shown how my hair could wear with other suggestions for everyday look that would render a kinder more gentler (healthier) scalp.   I learned how much hair care has changed in 20 years. Was shown how to embrace & even love the dynamic duo of a roll brush & hair dryer!  I was shown how to use products and what to expect with my new shampoo conditioner & hair conditioning oil.    My first two visits to lisa Turley salon was nothing short of top notch. I'm so happy to read this recurring opinion in other lisa Turley salon reviews because top notch service at LTS is a constant. Still, i wasn't sure I'd keep going to LTS because of my own fear to relinquish my bad hair habits.  Ever committed to the pursuit healthy hair follicles lisa had the (un)pleasantries of getting to the "root" of my unhealthy hair habits & gently offering/reminding me of alternatives/solutions that were all within my powers.   My third visit was transformational inside & out.  What patience & dedication lisa has to deconstruct old bad hair habits & reprogram with healthy hair ways!  Going to LTS is like going to therapy:  one knows in their gut what must be done but enlists a therapist to help foster necessary change.  Plus with LTS I receive a great conditioning, shape, and style.  You see?  LTS  IS transformational both inside and out.  Lisa was understanding & easy going when I disclosed I purchased a cheaper in price (and apparently quality) product similar to one she retails. I was hoping for the same result.  Nope. The other product didn't deliver like LTS endorsed product in the least.  She understood that I had to learn this "my way" and NVR did a "I told you so".    My relationship with LTS is ongoing and more than satisfactory (ecstatic really).  I can't imagine any one else making me feel good and shaping my hair like LTS.  Other mentionables related to LTS: Great assistant Easy to navigate website Miss LT presents herself well & professionally Stunning clean modern decor of studio Mindful of personal preferences (music selection & temp of room)  Offers a lil treat for the sugar addict inside me (cupcake anyone?) Great location  Appt reminders & twitter updates of availability

Dr. Lamb annihilates stigma that visiting the dentists office is unpleasant. . . his office is a professional outfit. Had my wisdom tooth extracted earlier this month, opting for anastheisia to avoid pain.  I got to keep my tooth as souvenir.  a great added touch was Gina his assistant is very personable, sincere and goes the distance to ensure comfort.  Dr. Lamb was thorough in explanation of procedure. a nice added touch is both gina and dr. lamb followed up that same day.  the wheelchair ride out of the office was fun, and the toothbrush i got to take home is still the gift that keeps on giving. i would definitely refer anyone of any age culture or preconceived notion about dentists to visit dr. lamb for dental care.

i dine at citizen any night of the week and enjoy taking friends who've not had the cph pleasure.  it's hard to explain/justify the greatness of signature chopped salad (i end up selling it my dinner mate du jour saying the salad is so good it has its own facebook fan page). the location is great, in the heart of old town and easy to get to as cph is on the corner of 5th and craftsman ct.  the vibe on any going night is easy going no matter how busy it is.  the familiar faces that do the meet and greet is an added touch being as how i notice with every visit cph is busy.   the atmosphere lighting is great and so is decor.  the seats in dining room could be a bit more "cushiony" to promote more relaxation.   menu terminology/ingredients could be dumbed down a bit diners who aren't the gourmand.  thankfully my girlfriend erica explained to me what an heirloom potoato is.  oh i get it, when asking what "this" is on the menu, the server can seize the moment to "sell" the dish to my awaiting tastebuds.  still, it's always a turn on to read and KNOW/imagine what the ingredients are than having to wander.  chopped salad and pork rind apps are top notch. i enjoyed the chicken with risotto, the smoke flavor was a bit much. chicken and waffles?  eh, the waffle was had a bit too much "buckwheat" taste to it.   mac and cheese would be much tastier if not served with sweet salsa on top.    i always receive impeccable service when sitting at the bar to eat.  drinks are great and i appreciate the bartender being constant in his attention to service /detail when i appear.  I've been a patron 8+ times now. he is singlularly responsible for the 2nd visit which has turned into unplanned but definite neverending visits to cph.  i order out here and there from cph.  when i came in one night to pick up the food he rang me up and i told him to keep the change, as i always tip when picking up take out.  (i'm in the service business). he thanked me and then asked if he could get me a drink while my order was being bagged.  i pick up all the time and am never asked this by waitstaff. this made the difference. i enjoyed a shirley temple in a to go cup and naturally he served it without charging.  i don't own a large operation like cph but how nice was it be served a non alcoholic beverage grazie.  again, the little added touches are what keeps a customer coming back.  if only other establishments offered free soft drinks while waiting for food.  the women's bathroom appears to be cleaned every time i've had to use lady's room. i've not yet (can't believe it) consumed any dessert.  i'm also wanting to try the grits app.    every person i've taken to cph has enjoyed it.

I do not let anyone near my eyelashes unless I am convinced they know what they are doing. I do lashes for a living. When I decided I needed a lash perm I searched high and low for the person. I found a good review on lash perm specifically with Jessica. She was prompt and courteous in returning my call and booking an appointment. She was there waiting for me and her well appointed clean private studio.  It was nice being on the other side being a client and having someone else provide a service which is usually what I do. Jessica discussed with me the results I could expect told me the process and what stood out is she continually checked in with me and asked about my comfort level when she was applying the lash perm. Heard touch was gentle and she had a nice energy to her. She was warm sincere and professional. I never once heard her smack her gum talk on her phone text or do anything that would make me feel like I was not the only thing in JT aesthetics universe deserving 100% attention.  When she unveiled my permed lashes they were also tinted and I was very happy, I still am very happy. I have since booked another appointment and look forward to a long lashing relationship with Jessica.

Great hip/trendy boutique - all around truly deserves 5 stars. Dr. G is reliable & constant in his professionalism. Admittedly I don't practice the best eye habits (removing contacts before bed) - dr. G delivers the news/consequences of my willful choices in such a way that I don't feel ashamed or admonished but I try to do better & be a more responsible contact wearer. The services here are top notch as is presentation and competitively priced. My visits to dr. G - his eye boutique - he's always running his shop with courtesy efficiency & with punctuality. I've only interacted with Debra & Dr. G- Debra manages & sets up appts - she was efficient in ordering my contacts & collecting for my eye exam. I have been to other eye doctors and while there was nothing wrong at other establishments ZEBRA OPTIQUE will continue to get my business & referrals because I feel valued and I know there is not a better eye ball custodian in Scottsdale than Dr. G.
