How many times have I been here? You can't even imagine. I think Sky Harbor is a great airport. The signage is easy, people are polite, and the airport is easy to figure out. I am an Arizona native and can still remember being able to go on top of the roof on what is now terminal 2 and watch planes take off and land. There is a lot of construction going on right now but the airport is still easy to navigate. You can go on top of the parking garages and watch the airplanes take off and land. The mountains surrounding the airport make for great backdrops as the planes make their ascents, and descents.

After shopping here , and using the veterinary services for many years without any problems, today I was witness to a rude clerk "not" doing her job. One assumes that when one works around animals, one cares about the animals in their store. Not true for the clerk that we had informed of a turtle that had turned itself over. The clerk's curt response was, "He does it all the time". Oh ok...so that makes it ok then I guess. Let's not forget the cage is too small for this particular turtle. I asked for the manager and she did the right thing offering to go help turn the turtle over. She came back stating the turtle was indeed turning himself over. Upon leaving the store, the aforementioned clerk said, "grrrrr". Apparently she was upset that we cared too much for a turtle. I thought about going back in and saying something to the long-haired blonde manager, but thought better of it as she didn't say anything to the clerk when she growled at us.  So miss slender, short haired, nose-pierced clerk....if you don't care for animals, get another job. Shame shame shame. ------  as a follow up - I was contacted by someone in customer service, but never heard back from them. One bad experience and person doesn't mean the whole store or staff are responsible or bad, but we have used a different pet store ever since. Let me say this about the turtle. I know who bought him (no, not me), and that greek tortoise is now spoiled and happy.

So I've been to this location several times. The first time-no problem, the last two times there have been problems-mostly communication. I really don't have time to teach English while placing my order. Also, plan ahead- don't wait to make chow mein and rice when you've already run out. We purposely sat at a table while chow mein was made so they didn't give us the dried out looking old chow mein in the bowl. Lastly, act like you care about what you're doing. The staff the last couple of times just seemed so Stepford Wife about it all-going through the motions without any idea of the purpose. They seem to run out of the popular items a lot. Again, planning ahead would be a plus. When there are commercials out about new items on the menu, people are going to order them, so let's try having some prepared.

Craving Chinese, so we went back to this location today. Chow Mein bowl is threads away from being empty, but do you think they were making any? NO. Same thing happened the last time I was here. I think they may need to install some type of monitor to let the cooks know when the Chow Mein is almost gone. The young lady serving the food was very nice, but she was literally doing everything while the 2 cooks  just stared at the food cooking...and by food, I don't mean Chow Mein. When we first got there we were the only ones in line. By the time we left there was a line 7 deep...know what they were waiting for? CHOW MEIN. To the owners/managers of this particular franchise. You really should read what people are writing. The food tastes good, but honestly I will drive a little further to get better service, or at least Chow Mein that is made with some forethought.

So I went to get my Xterra, "Scarlett", a wash and a very nice guy said, "Hey, your windshield wipers are pretty old". He asked me if I wanted them changed and I said, "Sure". He was done in 5 minutes. Scarlett got washed and I was on my way. They always do a good job here!

Month we went-May 2009.  Out to dinner with a friend and we had a delightful time. Our waitress, Sharona (I kid you not), was friendly and very helpful. She saw me perusing the margaritas and spoke about a couple of them. Our drinks arrived with the chips and salsa. I love that there were 2 little pots of salsa, one for each of us, as we love salsa. The margarita was a 9 out of 10 limes! We ordered a sampler of appetizers, and it was very good. I ordered a combo that included a chile relleno (I love chile rellenos). Our dinners arrived in a timely yet not too quick manner. This gave us time to work on our appetizers as well as have some great conversation. We didn't finish the appetizer as we were afraid we'd be too full to eat our dinners. My combo was hot and tasty. Sharona was a great waitress. She was knowledgeable without being pretentious. She gave us a take out container for our uneaten appetizers and we were on our way. All in all, this was such a relaxing dinner.

After some Hobby Lobby shopping with my dtr., sis, and mom, we headed to this place. First of all I was shocked there was this type of restaurant in AJ. Friendly greeting right away is always a plus. Chips and salsa came right away and were yummy.My daughter asked for hot sauce and it wasn't very good, so we stuck to the salsa. Our waitress came, took our drink orders and left us to peruse the menu which had a very nice selection of food. Our drinks came, dtr. and sis had a beer, mom had a margarita on the rocks with ice, and I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita. Egads, I should have stayed with my usual" on the rocks" as my margarita was the only bad thing of my experience here. It got a 1 out of 10 limes. I was encouraged to send it back but decided just to drink it...should have sent it back. It tasted like the bartender used a really bad margarita mix, and the strawberry did not seem fresh at all. Yuck Yuck. On to the food-with all the choices I still stuck with my favorite item to order, a chile relleno plate. It was very good. It arrived hot and cheesy. Sometimes at mexican restaurants the food arrives semi-hot and the cheese has already started to "harden". My dtr. had a bean chimichanga and said it was good. My mom had cheese enchiladas and said they were ok.  My sis had a chimichanga and beer...she said the chimi was good but the beer was kind of warm. The restaurant is cute, and our waitress was very nice. If my margarita had been good I could have given 5 stars easy.

Well...we needed a place to have late lunch/early dinner (3 generations). Close by was Nandos. You enter the restaurant and it's very pretty, and clean. The hostess asked us (about 50 times..ok, maybe only 5, but it felt like 50) if we wanted to sit near the bar because it was happy hour, or if we'd like a booth in the general restaurant. We opted for the general restaurant. As we sat down at the table, we noticed how much stuff was all over the table..honestly we couldn't even open the menus until we rearranged and put some stuff out of the way. The chips and salsa came very fast. Now I say salsa but it was actually hot sauce. I say hot sauce, but it wasn't hot at all. Hot if you're from Minnesota maybe, but it was not good. There were apparently 2 different kinds but you couldn't prove it by me. We ordered drinks. I ordered a habanero infused margarita (gee, maybe I'll get some heat from that). Let me say our waiter was very nice.The margarita gets a 6/10 limes from me. It was interesting, and did have a little bite to it. All of a sudden we had this weird fish smell that wafted our way from the table behind us. Oooo weee, it was fishy..not something we expected at a mexican restaurant. It was an uncomfortable fishy smell, and that's all I'm saying.   Our food didn't take too long to come..about 15 minutes. I ordered the seafood relleno. Now, I love my rellenos. This was not good. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. It came with beans and rice, and they were cooked very well, and had great taste. The relleno had shrimp that was rubbery. The sauce and cheese on it was good. The number 3 that one of us ordered was reported to be very good, and the border chimichanga was "alright".   The company was great. The waiter was friendly, attentive, and not a pest. The food and drinks were....ok.  My suggestions-hostess person, don't attack people when they first come in. There is a fine line between friendly and creepy.   Salsa- make some real salsa, or at least have your tomato tasting hot sauce have some heat.

The ambience is unforgettable. You actually go underground to get to the bar/restaurant. This is a must in the summer when the sun is scorching your skin. It is so cool and relaxing! The margaritas are very well made and the seafood is divine! This is such a cool place to impress out of towners or first timers, but don't tell them they're going underground before hand. The look of surprise on their faces is worth the wait. This restaurant/bar is one of the desert's best surprises! The food isn't cheap but isn't ridiculously priced either. Happy Hour Hurrah! My margarita lime vote for Salt Cellar is 10 Limes as the margaritas are so yummy!

A TOTAL DIVE WITH AMAZING FOOD! Guy Fieri needs to go here, and I am emailing him to let him know about this place.  We went on Thursday, April 7th as it was my daughter's birthday and she chose this as her place to go for lunch. She had been here before but it was my first time. If you don't know where you are going you would pass right by this place, and from the outside it doesn't look like much. Once inside, you pick a table and a waiter/waitress will come to you. The decor is not fancy, but it is fun and festive. We were asked for our drink order, and then the chips and salsa arrived. They bring a pot of red salsa, and a pot of green salsa. AMAZING RED SALSA. Be warned the salsas are spicy. You can take a first taste,think nothing of it... .and then comes the heat. We did order 2 more pots of salsa (fyi there is a charge for extra salsa). I liked the red much more than the green. The green was good too, but the red salsa has a great flavor and heat.       My daughter ordered a bean chimichanga with red sauce, I ordered the chile relleno dinner and ice cold beer. Shocker I know that I didn't order a margarita. The food is very, very good. I love chile rellenos and my dinner at Los Dos didn't disappoint. My daughter's chimi plate was also very good. The flavor of the food is authentic, and so good! We ordered guacamole and it tasted like they just made it...so yummy!      Parking can get very interesting during peak times so be aware. The service was great, and we will return here again. I can't wait to take my mom here, she will love it.

I wish you could taste the food (and margarita) just by reading this. The food never disappoints. The staff are wonderful, but the food remains the star! It is one of those local places that when you discover it, you want to both keep it a secret, yet share with the world because it's so good. Kudos on that raspberry margarita ! 10/10 limes on my "how good is that margarita" scale.

2 stars for the view and that's about all I liked of The Ghost Bar. My sis, dtr., and I went here having heard so much about it. Overpriced drinks that weren't very good (2 limes out of 10 for the margarita),the bartendress was like a stepford wife with no personality, and the bouncers were like cloned robots. Pretentious? Yes. We went in April and it was still chilly up there all those stories up but the view is really great. It's just not a fun bar. It's a bar to say you've been to and that's that. We had more fun at one of the bars inside the Palms Casino than we did in the Ghostbar. It's not a bar I'd ever return to.

I can not remember how I found out about this restaurant but it sounded different and interesting. First of all, good luck finding this restaurant. It is tucked way back off the road (Chandler Blvd). We actually drove right past it once and circled back and found it. The nearest main cross road is Dobson. The restaurant sits back (remember- way back) on the south side of Chandler Blvd. Do yourself a favor, google map it before you head here. Also, park in the back. There is a lot of parking in the back which is actually the east side of the restaurant. We parked in the front  We got here on a Thursday afternoon about 1230pm and it was not busy. There were 3 tables of people. There are a lot of tables, and according to some reviews it gets very busy. Don't get me wrong, I am glad it wasn't busy but it does make you kinda go hmmm when it's lunch time and not many people are at a restaurant. I had reviewed the order system with my friend prior to going to the restaurant so he was prepared for the extraordinary ordering system. Here's my beef with this-there is no way to know where to start or who to turn in your final exam of an order to. Remember it wasn't busy, so maybe the person staring out into space behind the counter could have said something BEFORE we had to ask. It's not like he was busy. I ordered a combo of egg foo yung, jerk fried rice, black beans, and a chile relleno burrito. My friend ordered a combo with a jerk chicken quesadilla, a chinese BBQ pork quesidilla, refried beans and jerk fried rice. We were handed our cups for our drinks and off we went. We had no idea where the drink station was because you can not see it from the order counter. To the left of the order counter, and down a bit is the drink/silverware/napkins/salsa/asian sauce and to-go covers. We took a seat and about 10 minutes later our food was delivered to us. They even deliver a cookie with each order. I don't know if they change the kind of cookie from day to day but that day the cookie was a snickerdoodle. The food is very good. It's kind of cool to be able to order chinese and mexican food at the same place. My egg foo yung is the darkest I've ever seen, but it was good. The chile relleno was heavenly. The jerk fried rice was moist and tasty. The black beans tasted a lot better than they looked. My friend said both of his quesadillas were good as well. He thought the jerk chicken was just a little better than the chinese bbq. I would have given this restaurant only 3 stars due to the lack of customer service.  The good food gets the 4. The food is not overpriced which could almost bring this to a 5 star review. In this economy a place to grab some great food at a very reasonable cost is much appreciated. Our combos were about $7.50 each with the drinks costing $1.50. Pet peeve about the place- the employees constantly went in and out of the kitchen. CONSTANTLY. I don't know where they were going but since we were sitting just to the right of the kitchen we were acutely aware of how many times the door open. It makes me worry about the whole handwashing thing prior to working with food.  Don't go here looking for ambience as there is none. You will sit at tables looking at a parking lot. There is a TV on and we watched some opening day baseball. This is not a first  date night kind of place, but more a hang with your friends kind of place  Chino Bandido is comfortable, and roomy. Groups would easily be seated here. The food is the star! . Remember B is for burrrito, and Q is for quesadila :)

So I went there to buy the new Nook HD as a Christmas gift.I might as well have been buying a magazine for as much customer service I received. There was a display of all the Nooks, but nowhere did it say to go to register to buy it. The display, nice as it was, could not answer questions I had. This is not my first Nook purchase as it seems they come out with a new one each year, however I still had some questions. I went to the customer service counter and asked where I could find the Nooks to purchase. He curtly told me they were at the register (as if I was to have already known this). I went to the register and was helped ( well, I wouldn't really call it helped) by a woman whom I'd really like to name here, but won't. Her disinterest in my purchase was evident and I was guided in buying the wrong screen protector.  Again, this wasn't a cheap purchase, and I was the only one in line until an obvious off-duty employee came in and they exchanged their hellos. The gift was well-received, and with the gift receipt the recipient was able to exchange for the correct screen protector. This wasn't one employee giving bad customer service...this was 2. It's a no return store for me.

I first heard about this place from my dad in Arlington, Tx. He had seen an episode of Diner's, Drive Ins, and Dives, and thought the food looked really good. Since my brother was in town, I thought going to eat here would be something to do in my dad's memory. I had also seen the Diner's, Drive Ins, and Dives show about this place and thought it looked worth a try. After reading some of the reviews I must say I believe they are buying into some of the hype created by the aforementioned show. We went around noon, so we expected it to be busy, but the line to order was like standing in line waiting to board an amusement ride, as you circle through metal line dividers. You grab your menus from a menu holder up by the window. You figure this out on your own by the way. So after about a 20 minute wait, we get to the window. The woman taking our order could have cared less. Her hair was long (past her shoulders) and not tied back, or clipped up which I think isn't a good idea working around all that food. She was obviously not having a good day and got the order wrong. I didn't realize the order was wrong until we were outside at the fountain drink place. Thankfully my daughter went back inside to clarify the order. There was another line at the fountain drinks/condiments area, but again, it was lunch time. They give you a beeper that signals when your food was ready. Our beeper went off, we gathered our food, and went to sit inside. There were plenty of people sitting outside, but being that it's June in Arizona, inside felt a lot better. This was especially true for my brother visiting from Seattle. He had almost melted in Texas due to the humidity, lol. My daughter had the grilled cheese, and sweet potato fries. She liked them both. My brother had the farm burger, and I ordered the barbecue chicken pizza. We ordered garlic fries, and onion rings on the side for all of us to sample. The pizza was ok. Granted I expected it to be phenomenal after watching the TV show, but it was just ok. The garlic fries, and onion rings were good. My brother said the farm burger was good as well. Now, the dark chocolate shake was heavenly! I ordered one of these as my dad loved chocolate shakes. He would have loved it. It is a cute place to eat as it's has such a retro feel to it, but the line was something my dad would not have enjoyed. After looking at some of the pics reviewing this restaurant, and reading the reviews, I think breakfast here looks really worth a try. The food is good but the experience was a little lacking. FOLLOW UP-ALL IS GOOD. Truly a business shouldn't  be judged by one less than stellar experience. I still haven't tried breakfast yet but plan to do so soon. Joe's Farm Grill is a breath of fresh air and originality in a world of chain franchises.

Really a bad location and the wait staff could care less if you get served or not. It reminds me of a place that was in such a hurry to open they forgot a few of the must haves. Avoid it like the plague. Also I know many who have had their vehicles towed from parking around Dos Gringos. There is no where to park unless you're one of the first 10 patrons. Food was forgettable and the margarita gets a 1 out of 10 limes from me. Blah!

Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A Margaritaville close to home! I am a local and have  been to 8 Margaritavilles (Key West, Las Vegas, Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, Orlando, Grand Cayman, Cozumel,Glendale)! Yes, I am a long time parrothead and love Jimmy Buffett-his music, the parrothead lifestyle, and of course, margaritas!. This location doesn't have slides that empty into a pool or water, nor do they  have trampolines in the ocean to bounce on, but is sits right off the Westgate dancing fountains, so there is water around! Margaritaville Glendale is in the Westgate Center which is in the Cardinal Stadium complex (hate the name University of Phoenix Stadium). You can sit inside or outside. The food is wonderful-The Volcano Nachos are towering feasts of wonder and are made for more than one person to eat! The Jamaica Mistaika wings are sweet yet spicy, and the Corn and Crab Chowder soup is delightfully good! The Margaritas get my 10 lime seal of approval!! I have yet to ever have a bad margarita at any of the locations and it's nice to know that you can order a drink and expect excellence, time and time again! The ceiling depicts The Arizona Beach (you know after California drifts away from the mainland). I have to limit my review to 4 stars as when we were there on opening day and having a great look around at the nuances of this locale, the manager was a bit uptight about it, and it put a bit of a downer on the 1st visit. The waitstaff are wonderful as are the Smuggler's hold staff, especially Shay!  There really isn't a trademark "thing" like a blender that gets dived into, or an exploding volcano. That would have been nice! ----------- Update August 2009. -We've been back more than once but I wanted to give Margaritaville KUDOS for outstanding customer service. I have now upgraded my review to 5 stars. Never let it be said that one person can not represent an entire chain of restaurants in one fell swoop. We went for lunch August  27th and ordered conch fritters for appetizers. We both had frozen Desdemona Raspberry Ritas as well. I then ordered a lunch size Chicken Caesar Salad, and my daughter ordered Bayou Shrimp Pasta. Upon it's arrival, my salad looked and tasted divine.My daughter didn't realize the pasta dish had sausage in it, and was looking at it making a funny face. I had just asked her what was wrong when our waitress appeared. She could also see my daughter sort of picking at the dish. My dtr. asked if there was sausage in it and the waitress said yes. This waitress ( I believe her name was Heather) immediately, and I mean IMMEDIATELY offered to take it back and get her something else.She said we wouldn't be charged for it at all, and she'd be glad to get her something she could eat. It was her immediate willingness to resolve this matter that made me ask her to go ahead and put it in a to go box and I would take it home to my hubby. She asked "Are you sure 'cause it is no problem to just switch them out". I assured her that it would be fine, and my dtr. ordered another shrimp dish which was wonderful! In this day and age, having someone so willing to make something right is refreshing!! I am hoping that Margaritaville sees this and recognizes the young lady for her outstanding customer service!!! The frozen raspberry ritas got 10 out of 10 limes for being frozen concoctions of pure delight!!

After a day full of meetings, I gathered a friend, and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. "Hi, are you here for happy hour?". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe "lots of product in his hair" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation "on the rocks with salt". My drink, and my friend's water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here aren't complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. My friend brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now my friend is getting annoyed. It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants, so we're not sure where they are coming from, but they don't stop. Friend mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and my friend asks for the manager. Hell, he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus we'll call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? That's your solution? He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We weren't after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. My friend had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok.  This is a never return place for me. And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant. The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good.

We discovered this place when we drove over to see how the Margaritaville Glendale construction was going. What a sweet find! First impression is that it's so comfortable and inviting looking! There is great seating on the outside patio with really comfortable chairs, and the seating inside is also very comfortable. You notice the many, MANY, tap handles that circumvent the bar! I tried the Lost Coast Great White specifically because of the very cool tap handle! I was not disappointed! The music playing is awesome and really sets the atmosphere. How I wish there was a Yard House in the East Valley as it would be a great place to meet with friends on a very regular basis. The food-WOW FACTOR OF 10. I have the same thing when I eat there as it is unbelievably good! The Jerk Chicken with Shrimp Stack. Such delectable mouth watering goodness!!! The waitstaff have always been so friendly. We haven't had long waits any of the times we've been there.

Well, we found a new favorite restaurant! We have been several times, I just never wrote the review. After seeing the commercial for this place, we decided to drive down and try it. The chips and salsa came as quickly on the 5th visit as they did the first visit. The restaurant is very cute inside, and we have greeted every time by friendly staff members at as we entered the restaurant. The margaritas get 9/10 limes as they are wonderful. They would have received 10/10's but the frozen strawberry margaritas served to the group had sugar on the rim. This family is a salt-on-the rim kind of family, and it would have been nice if the server had asked our preference. I love chile rellenos and of course ordered them here, and have had them each and every time since. Now, the first time I ordered these I wasn't as prepared for the amount of heat and punch the hatch chiles offered-even though I had been prepared/warned by the 3 chili listing on the menu which meant-prepare to sweat (my words not theirs). In other visits my friend asked for the green chiles on the side and this helped reduce the heat.Trust me if the menu states it is 3 chili hot, it is hot. Yummy for those of us that love the heat.      Only once did we have sub-par service, and of course it was when I took my mom there. I assured her that this waitress and her lackadaisical attitude was not the norm. 4/5 times we had remarkable service. The salsa is great and more is brought quickly when you run out. The food is tasty, and delicious. It is, as I said before, our new favorite restaurant.

I was shopping around for a Christmas gift of 16 year aged Bushmills and a friend told me that it was in stock here at Total Wine and More. What an incredible place! Aisles well-marked, and a superior selection of wine, spirits, and more. The staff was helpful, and friendly which is saying a lot as it was the week of Christmas. I didn't have to wait long at all to check out and found a couple more items that made great gifts. This will be my go-to place for spirit shopping.

What a cute, and yummy place this is! I was in the mood for Tiki / Islandy something and found this restaurant on Yelp. OMG go figure. What a delightful little find. We started with 2 Lilikoi margaritas which have passion fruit in them. This margarita is in my top 3 ever favorite margaritas. I give that margarita 10 limes for its balanced yumminess. My mouth waters now  just typing this. Moving on-we went for lunch, and while we didn't wait long for a table, once we were at the table, it took quite awhile to get our drinks ordered, and place our food order. That said, after that initial snafu all went well.     We started with some Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls-they were gone about as fast as they were delivered. They were so tasty with a delightful pineapple-horseradish dipping sauce. The two orders from there were The Modern Tiki Fish sandwich, and The Cajun burger. Both were so good. Both orders were so tasty and good!!!

First and Last Visit. I went here with my mom as she was craving a burger. She had a bacon burger and a drink. I had a grilled cheese with jalapenos, some cajun fries, and a drink. What you notice visually at  first are the multiple, pasted-everywhere signs about how great they are. Red flag. The music was blaring so loud, and was quite a turn-off.  We found our way to the order counter, passing by the big bags of peanuts. Really? In a burger joint? Ordered, attempted to eat inside, but due to the music went outside. There are way too many fries in the order. The cajun seasoning was sparse at best. Mom said her bacon burger was good. My cheese sandwich was ok, and I liked having the jalapeno choice to put on it. I have to tell you I am unimpressed with this place. I think having the choices to put on your burgers/sandwiches are nice but the presentation was lackluster. Every order is placed in a bag as a to-go order, even if you're eating at the restaurant.

This Starbucks is right off the freeway and has a drive-thru..great combo. The service is fast and friendly.

Wow. What a disappointment. I've been to the North Mesa restaurant and expected the same from here. NOPE. I noticed another reader commented on how it doesn't even smell like there is Mexican food cooking here.It didn't. We just walked in and realized you didn't get to sit down and get waited on. You went up and ordered as if you were at a fast food restaurant.We had just barely walked in the door and 3 people behind the counter asked if we were ready to order. There were 5 more people around them. This would explain why many tables had dirty food on them. I ordered a mole enchilada and a fish taco. Do you think they could have put them on the same plate? No. The mole was good, but pricey. The fish taco was good, and pricey as well. You have to pay for chips and salsa and they give you salsa in little cups. I asked for the hot and it was not hot and very vinegary. This is a do not return for me.

Waited until last minute but I was in and out within 15 minutes! I checked the wait times before I came ( 1030 a.m. ). Staff were nice and efficient!

First time there. We were tired from moving and decided to get food. The biscuits and gravy, and omelette were good, as was the pot of coffee left at the table. They'll never know how much that was needed. The portions are good sized. I love that they give discounts to the military. I would have given 5 stars but some open sign kept falling down outside, and then the door wouldn't shut. Several workers just walked by and didn't seem to notice or care. The glare from the sun was a bit irritating with the door open or I wouldn't even have mentioned it.

When did this little "fast food" dream end up in my neighborhood? I went to it for lunch the same day I spotted it and ordered the caesar salad with low fat caesar dressing, some rosemary garlic prawns added, and a small lemonade. OMG, the salad was so good. It was fresh, and tasty. They ask you if you want the dressing on the side so you can add it yourself, or have it already placed into salad. That it's a drive-thru is incredible. This will be a go-to spot prior to going to work! This sort of restaurant is so overdue. The staff was very pleasant, and the service was fast.

Saw this place, was excited to try it, until I heard they sold SHARK tacos. Shame on you So-Cal for doing this. Will never go there now.

I've been to this store several times but never wrote a review. I finally upgraded my iPhone this last week and had the best service ever by Brandon K.. He said he was in training but you wouldn't know it! He helped get my phone backed up, and explained some of the new attributes to my new iPhone! The other staff members were also helpful, but Brandon K. helped make my new purchase a success!
