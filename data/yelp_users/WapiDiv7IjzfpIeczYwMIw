This airport is fairly large, it is nice but could use some more AC because it's pretty hot inside, very clean and pretty easy to get to your gates.   So as soon as I landed and got out of the plane, I had to meet up with the rest of the ladies who arrived earlier than I did to Terminal 3. It was quite a long walk and it was so cool to take the tram and got to see parts of the airport.  Plenty of food options (I was in Terminal 4), the Starbucks was near my gate so I was happy it wasn't going to be a long walk. The food choices before security line is decent then beyond the security line.. it's just meh.  Overall, it's a decent airport to fly out to and from.

McCarran International Airport is about less than a mile a way from the strip hotels so the taxi ride should costs you between $15-$20. This airport is probably the only one that has slot machines and it was first thing I've noticed when I stepped off the plane and into the terminal. I just wish they are not in the area where people wait to board their flights as I find these slot machines in the way and taking up more space than usual.  This airport is clean and well-managed. Not too confusing to navigate around. I hope they upgrade this airport to look more fancy so it matches the rest of Vegas and also upgrade their AC system because it's always hot inside this airport due to many people and the hot weather of course.

Came here with a friend of mine for a weekend getaway. I wasn't planning on staying here but my friend insisted since her father has a timeshare that we could use. Free room? HELL YES!   We arrived kind of late since we took a late flight due to getting off work at 5:00 pm. I like how this hotel is in the middle of the strip so your walks are not so long and tiring if you go at the end of the strip or something. The staffs were nice and friendly.. asking if it's our first time staying and told us there's a mini-mart just in case we want to cook our meals, pool is on the room top and if we needed anything else that we should give them a call from our room.  One thing I like about this hotel was their elevators - you need your key card in order to go up and down the floor. No strangers wandering around the floor if you are paranoid or just worried about the safety of your place heheh  We had the villa. I must say I didn't like our view that much because it was mostly on the side and all we see is the parking garage but we didn't really care as much. They have every basic amenities - stove, coffee maker, toaster, microwave, you name it. The bed was very comfortable as well. The AC felt so nice since it was hot outside while walking... it just a bit noisy at night when they are automatically turning on and off. Oh their fridge! I like their freezer because there's this switch if you want to make ice cubes and all that.. then you can just put the switch back if you don't want anymore ice cubes being made.   Overall, we had a pleasant stay here. I would definitely go back in the future.

Every time I go inside every hotel in Las Vegas strip... The Venetian has the best scent ever. I cannot smell any cigarettes or any of that weird funky smell that I get from the other LV strip hotels. LOL.  This is my favorite hotel to stay in because it is luxurious in every detail. You are greeted by there role playing victorian styled people as you go inside the hotel. I find that unique because I don't think I remember other hotels doing the same thing as The Venetian, I could be wrong.   I love their beds because they are super duper comfortable and I slept like a total baby for the little sleep I've done while in Vegas, haha.

My first Circus de Soleil show that I've watched! I didn't know what to expect except.. it has to be good!  I have to admit.. I was kind of confused at the whole thing but I didn't care because the show was very very entertaining. This lady playing a role of a kid was looking for a papa and she picked a man at the audience - I thought it was pretty funny on how she called him papa in a kiddish voice. Although I didn't understand the whole story concept of the show... I was very mesmerized by the lead singer - she was on top of the stage to the side. I was sooooo impressed by her voice - she could be in the lord of the rings or mythical movie or show there is and be a fairy or some sorceress! She was REALLLLY good!   The whole experience was fantastic! I'm looking forward to watching other Circus de Soleil show in Las Vegas.

I loooooveeeee the Prime Rib here is very tender and tasty.   I made reservations through OpenTable to avoid waiting in line since I could get very impatient standing in a long line. So yes, my friend and I have avoided the long line and we went through the "VIP" door where we checked in, paid, and got seated right away.   Our server came up to our table right away to take our drink order and we've proceeded to getting our food. The moment I saw Prime Rib... I've patiently waited for the people in front of me to get their cut and make up their minds about which sauce to put. Next, I went to their seafood area and there was a horde of people taking all the crab legs which I find very annoying... because hello people you're not the only ones at the buffet to take all of those crab legs. I left but I had an intention to go back for my second round of plate.   I saw the dessert selections and I love their french macaroons the most... the same person taking all the crab legs was behind me so I took all the chocolate french macaroons.. I mean seriously there was only 5 left lol payback I guess?  In the end... I got my crab legs and left a happy camper. Our server was very quick and attentive filling up our waters and other drinks. NOMNOMS

Review 250th + Chippendales review = let the panties drop!  One word: DAAAAAAAAAYUMMMMMM.  Seriously, Magic Mike up in this shiettt. All this place is missing is Channing Tatum.  Came here with my bride-to-be girlfriend, Merica S. along with the entire bachelorette party and we all had a blast.. too much blast! ;)  The guys were all very entertaining, and there were a lot of interaction with the crowd. I don't want to spoil much of what happens in here but get your eyes ready for some tease, role plays, ass slappin' if you get lap danced by one of them and get your already dirty soul ready if you've been selected to be on stage - you won't be disappointed ;) SHIETTTT I wished I was on stage for some IMAX 3D view. These men loves ripping their wife beater and throw it to the audience.. ayyyy dios mio! muy caliente! The ladies were getting their panties wet. Oh yeah, if you're into men in uniform just like me... you'd have a lady boner.. just saying.   I already had my eyes on someone and I don't know his name but damn I'd pour some chocolate syrup on his abs and lick it... dat ass too... I just want to nibble on it.... Ok, I'm going to stop. He was so hot. I love me some Caucasian men :D   Our bride to be had a lot of fun. She got to dance with some of the guys when they were going around the tables. I wished she got on stage to get the best view of these men, haha.  Before they end their show, they let you take photos and videos of them.. I think for about 5-10 minutes so make sure you get your phones ready to snap photos.   This place isn't just for a bachelorette party, birthday party, get your panties wet or just being in Vegas party... if you got divorced... they celebrate that too here. Lol. your party can also take pictures with the men afterwards too. We didn't get to do that since we were heading out to the club.  Feel free to invite me to your bachelorette party. I'd go back to this place :D

Meh... My experience here back in June with friends wasn't that pleasant. We got seated a few minutes after I checked in since I made reservations for me and friends. I ordered the Mint Frozen Hot Chocolate and it was okay. Our food twas taking forever to arrive and we've noticed that the tables surrounding us that were seated maybe 20 minutes after us got their food before we did. We found out that our server didn't even put our order in so we sat on our table literally waiting for nothing. We all got irritated and told our server to cancel our order and left. I guess at least I got to taste the frozen hot chocolate but whatevs.

I was with a handful of women when I went to Scottsdale, AZ for a Women's Empowerment retreat and we have a day to ourselves before the shenanigans happen. So my friend was planning to meet up with her cousin who lives in Tempe.. so I asked her to if I could tag along and they were cool with it. They (cousin and the fiance) picked us up from our hotel and headed out to Bei.  Atmosphere/Ambiance:  I like the atmosphere here because it was not your regular quiet sushi place.. it was more like a sushi restaurant + sports bar with bunch of TV's + live bands on certain days type of combination. There wasn't any live bands when we went but they were playing good music.  Food:  - Love Hurts Roll (Crab Mix, Avocado, Topped with Baked White Fish with Spicy Aioli, and Eel Sauce, Scallions, Sriracha): really good spiciness from the Spicy Aoili & Sriracha, the White Fish portion was decent and the sushi didn't fall apart after a bite. - Chicken Teriyaki entree (Chicken teriyaki, steamed rice, vegetable tempura, miso soup, house salad): it was more like a Chicken Teriyaki sizzling plate! I wished they wrote that it's a sizzling plate entree than a regular entree.. but regardless it was good portion... I enjoyed my vegetable tempura the most.  Service:  Our server was pretty attentive to us since even though it was getting a bit busy by the time we ordered our food.   In the end, it was a great place that my friends cousin had picked and I can see myself coming back here in the future. It seemed like a great place for Happy hour shenanigans too.

I came here with a few girls (including Akemi H.) to grab a snack during lunch time of our retreat. This place is a bit small so about 9 or 10 of us pretty much filled the seating area already.   I got the Chocolate Dream smoothie.. to be honest.. I didn't like it at first few sips then the taste got better so I ended up liking it. It wasn't your typical Chocolate smoothie where it's sweet and all that sugary taste. I also got their Chocolate Covered Banana snack... there were good, chocolatey, chewy and a great snack.  I got to try Akemi H.'s PB Bowl and it was delish! I'm going to get that whenever we go back to a Nekter Juice Bar location.  One of the girls got these Vanilla grab n go protein drinks from the shelf.. I tried it.. it was not cat-approved but I'm pretty sure other people like them though :)
