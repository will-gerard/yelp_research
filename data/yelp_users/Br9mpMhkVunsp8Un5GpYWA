I am so glad they remodeled this place.  It was getting a bit run down, but is a staple as one of the only dairy queens in the central Phoenix Area.   The service is good and the ice cream always hits the spot.  Yesterday we went through the drive-thru and had to wait a bit, but once the window a Hispanic man in his early 20s handed us our amazing shakes and was so friendly.  He was overly kind and made me wish I had gotten his name as we drove away.

My daughter did a trial class and loved it.  We signed her up and she went to one class and then got scared for some reason and would not go back.  I understand they do not do refunds, but I just wanted to talk to someone about getting a partial refund or credit for my other daughter to do a class.  Even if they didn't let me get a refund or credit, I just wanted to hear from them.  I left 2 messages with people and 3 messages on their machine.  NO RESPONSE EVER.  Just call me please and let   me know either way.

If you are looking for a good spot to get a great oil change.. this is your spot.  They are super friendly, have never tried to "sell" me all the extras that you sometimes get when you take your car in for an oil change.  Their oil change is very extensive as well.  You can usually grab a coupon online for $22 for the complete oil change.

This location feels like the perfect spot for a TJs.  It just fits the area, we have been to the one at Arrowhead and it feels a little out of place up there.  But at Camelback and 20th its just the right fit.  I always like to buy one new thing when doing a large grocery shop and am always pleased!   Here are a few of our Favs:  Peanut Butter Cream Cheese Fresh Motz Cheese Balls  Chocolate Jo Jos Garlic Herb Pizza Dough  These are just to name a few.  Trader Joes knows how to do a unique, fun, healthy market.

The food and especially tortillas are amazing!  I would never eat at the location, but a quick pickup for lunch (during daylight!) is perfect.  They are always cops there EATING so you know its good!

I am not a beer drinker, so this is not rating the beer, but the food and atmosphere.  1) Atmosphere: sweet - great patio and nice bar scene inside  2) Food - pretty good for bar food  3) Hit it up if you are in Tempe, its just one of those places you need to go

We went last friday with a large group and used the private room.  The service was good for a party of 30 and the pizza great.  We had the four cheese with bacon and it was super tasty and reasonably priced. We enjoyed it so much we went back with some friends on Sunday night.  We tried the Buffalo Chicken which was good and just a bit spicy.  We also the the 4 cheese again with sausage. They forgot the sausage the first time, so gave us an extra pizza to take home. Great food and service.

This is the Best Burger in Phoenix. The Buns are AMAZING, the meat fresh, and the Toppings always tasty!  I order a Kids Meal Burger and am sure to top it with ranch, honey mustard, cheese sauce.  This is a Phoenix staple that we will return to time and time again when craving a burger, fries, or milkshakes!

I grew up going to Fajitas about twice a month and am still a big fan.  The food and service are amazing.    There is no reason to get anything but fajitas at this spot.  We love the chicken and the Cadillac beef the best.  They tortillas are amazing.. They make them right there and are the best in town. The service is always great and this is a good spot for large groups as well.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars vs 5 stars is because they need to update the dining room and restrooms.  The place is always clean, but the restrooms are in real need of a major renovation.

I grew up going to Caramba for a quick lunch and basically all of my high school functions were catered by them.   The nachos with chicken are amazing!  Totally loaded up, hard to find chip that is not covered in gooey goodness.  The catering is also very reasonable and great tasting. I grabbed some beans and rice to go along with our homemade enchiladas last night for an event and they did not disappoint. Just wish they would branch out of the NW valley a bit and add a spot in downtown phx!

We got our used Honda Pilot from RC auto in April of 2010.  The experience could not have been better.  I recommend RC auto to anyone buying a new or used car.  They are professional and friendly - no pressure.  I emailed what I was looking for they sent me a few selections and then I made an appt to test drive them.  The vehicles are kept in a large garage and they let me take them each out on my own.  When I got back and let them know my preference, they let me know the bottom line price and then sent me on my way with the papers to have my husband who was not there at the time sign them, they then brought the car to my place of employment and everything was done... Will always get our cars from RC auto!    Also the price was below KBB.

Buffalo Chip is like another world!  We love living in downtown Phoenix, but this place is a great getaway for the night.  If feels like another world.  The dance floor is always packed and drinks flow freely.  The food is ok, but nothing great.    The live bull riding on Friday nights pack this place out, but its also worth it...   Super fun. Great place to go with a group of friends.  Just make sure you whip out your wranglers and boots before hitting it up.

Hipster hangout you can drag the kids along and not feel bad about it.  The place is setup like a house and the first time you go it is for sure confusing.  Do I sit down or go to the counter or bar or what.. Its kind of a free for all.  I have been a few times and still feel a little awkward when I walk in.  The hot chocolate is great and the egg sandwich tasty.  The mac and cheese for evening is also really good.   The service is ok, but not overly helpful or friendly. The place is dripping with kids too cool for school, businessmen, and families... so a great spot to hit up if you are in downtown phx

Pretty much you could not make this place any better unless you could make it bigger, which I have heard rumored might be happening.  The atmosphere is perfect - a charming old house and great patio.  We once went with a group of 28 and had dinner on the patio and it was perfect.  Food Suggestions - the Antipasto platter - it is a must, the best in Phx The pizzas are also great and I have heard the crepes as well, but I myself and not a huge crepe fan, so have not tried them out.  If you don't live in the downtown area and are headed down for a sporting or cultural event, this should be your first stop.  Only issue would be parking - its a really small lot, but you can usually snag a spot on the street pretty easy.

We live in Artisan Village so we can literally walk out our door and be at this location in about 30 steps.  It is a great addition to the neighborhood and the only shop along the way that has actually stayed in business.  The staff is usually pretty friendly and the food good.  The breakfast sandwiches are really tasty and you can build your own.  The chicken monacco sandwich is also very good and unique.  I have not had one like it anywhere else.  The baked good are the highlight and don't disappoint.  The crack cake is as good as it sounds and the brownie is loaded with tasty frosting.  They are a bit pricey but a great splurge treat.

Pork Chili Mac & Cheese - that's all that needs to be said.  Done!  Ha ha, the place is a great local stop for a dinner or lunch.  I have only gotten the mac and cheese, but my husband has had the Grilled Peach and Salmon Salad and loved it.   The atmosphere is a bit odd - kind of an asian/ikea feel,but the food and service make up for it!

If you are looking for a great place and want to get off the strip for a bit this is a fun place to take the family.  It is great for larger parties and kids. The staff was very friendly and accommodated our group of 8 with 4 of those being kids.   The portions are crazy big, but as some places with huge portions they like on quality, this is not the case there.  The quantity and quality are both done well.  I was able to order one dish and share with my 2 kids and there was plenty to go around.   This is not a place to hit up if you are looking for a light meal, but more a splurge to indulge while on vacation.

The Hyatt Place Scottsdale is a hidden jewel in old town, just off the main drag this place is perfect for a weekend getaway.  They offer complimentary breakfast which is pretty standard but nice and even have "real" plates and utensils vs. plastic products.  They also have free WIFI and the rooms are HUGE!  It is a great place to take the family since the kids can stay in the first part of the room on the sofa sleeper while you can crash on the comfy bed closer to the TV. The only reason I give 4 stars vs. a perfect 5 is because the pool is really small and not that great.  If they upgraded the pool a bit they would be golden.

If you are new in town Valle Luna is a must stop for some great mexican food.  They have a few valley locations and will not disappoint.   The Sonoran Todo (Appetizer) is a platter of Mexican fried delights and can be shared by 2-3 people for your MEAL.  Its a great deal and super tasty.  The Pollo Fundido is also a must and can also be split as it comes with rice and beans.  The atmosphere is typical any mexican food spot, so pretty much out of date with several "team" photos of teams they support lining the walls.  The service is usually pretty good as well, but its the food that makes this place a must visit.

This chain is doing it right.  Its a great place for a larger group and the variety of drinks is perfect.  The truffle mac and cheese is one of the best I have had.  Its very creamy and always consistent in great taste.  If you want to hit up a chain this is one to check out.

Love that we now have a "downtown" grocery spot!  I usually hit up the public market on my walk home from the YMCA.  Its nice to run in and grab a few things for dinner or lunch, but don't think you can do all your shopping there... Love the vibe with the small cafe as well.   Last week I was in there I picked up some cheese curds that were an amazing price and so tasty.    In Conclusion, great place for special items for a few meals, but won't take the place of Trader Joes or Fresh and Easy quite yet

We got our fridge/washer and dryer from them 7 years ago (different location). Have never had any issues and the pricing was great.  Looked at Lowes first and did some price matching around town, Spencers was the best by far.   No hassle walked in, was shown the model I was interested, given the bottom line price (they gave me a the memorial day discount a week early).  Setup to have it installed the next Morning. It's in and the installer (subcontractor) was super friendly and it looks great.

We love Hobe meats.  For awhile we were buying most of our meat there and recently just got out of the habit since we got busy with life, but I plan to start again.  We were making it a family tradition to hit up Hobe on Saturday when they had their BBQ as well.  For $5 you can get fun little lunch after you stock up on meat for the week.  They are helpful in suggesting new cuts of meat to try and give you suggestions on how to prepare them.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and they often have groupons so you can save $ there too.

I have been there at least 3 times and gotten facials each time.  The atmosphere is great and so similar to a spa minus the bathroom/powder rooms they have at spas.  It is $30 for a facial that lasts about an hour. I am going to start a clinic study series where for $225 they do 8 treatments ranging from facials to peels.  I am very excited and think its a great deal.

My husband got me a dress here and it was super cute, but too short. There was also a long string near the waist that I noticed, but did not pay much attention too. I went to Paradise Valley to return it (tags on with receipt) and they said there was a  missing belt. I let them know it did not have a belt when he got it,but they would not take it back.  So I went to Fashion Square where he got it, explained the situation and they happily took it back and credited my card, not just a store credit. Thanks!

We had a group of 14 and the service and food were amazing.  It's hard to find both with a party that large, but Wally's scored the highest markets.  Not one person in our party did not love the food - from the burgers and mac and cheese to the pot roast and fish and chips everyone gave Wally's a 5 star review.    The staff was friendly and had our table waiting upon arrival.  The waters were already set on the table and the drink orders came out quickly and correct.  The food for the group was out within 15 minutes of ordering and again it was all so tasty.    Its great "pub" food and we will be back!

Nice park to have in central Phoenix.  This place is huge!  There are areas for picnics, basketball courts, fishing lake with ducks for feeding and nice playground areas. It is often very crowded on the weekends, but a great place to meetup during the week with other moms so the kids can play and feed the ducks.

HIssyfits is a jewel in uptown Phx.  The owner is super friendly and the employees always make you feel welcome.  I am not sure where the other reviews about rude associates are from, I have only ever been welcomed.  The clothing is name brands and the pricing is perfect.  You can expect to grab a few gap tees from $2.50-$4.00 each, jeans are usually about $6.00 and they they also have some great local homemade items on hand.  I usually stop in before a kids birthday party to grab some really cool new shades and a box of unique band aids for a fun gift.   They are also great when it comes to consigning your items, they take most name brands that are in good condition.   The only issue I have is that the store is a bit cramped and they usually have several bags of items to price and put out near the checkout. Otherwise, Hissyfits rocks!

I went to the spa last Saturday 4/20 with a group of friends.  I chose to get the "too sexy for your shoes pedicure," because I was pretty sure it was on Facebook as their pedicure special for April $55.  The facility was nice and the locker rooms very nice as well. When I went to get my pedicure, things started to go wrong.  Instead, of coming into the salon area and asking if I wanted a drink or magazine before I started I was rushed back to choose a color and begin.  They didn't confirm the kind of pedicure I was getting or anything.  The woman who did the pedicure started right away with a bit of small talk and then pretty much was silent the rest of the time, which is fine by me.   The pedicure was ok, nothing great and not work the $ for sure.  It was basically a cheap pedicure.  When she was finished she pulled back the arm and left... never come back?  Guess I am done??  One of my toes is totally crooked and she didn't ask if I wanted them cut or filed and they are bit shorter than I prefer as well.  I have been to several higher end pedicures ($50-$75 each) and this was by far below average.  I would say it was more like a $30 pedicure.  When I checked out they said it was $60 and I questioned the price  since I thought it was on special.  They responded no and that was pretty much it. With the mandatory grat it came to $70.. again totally not worth it.  I would recommend the Spa at Gainey Village if you are looking for an higher end pedicure for sure!

We had a terrible experience.  It was a rainy day, of course the  place was crowded.  They only had "bisque" left and they had 2 options.  My husband brougth home the medium size which is really pricy.  It tasted like slightly flavored water with a few veggie chunks.  I would not have bothered to take it back, but it was so pricy and since we love downtown places, we wanted to the owner to know.  The woman was very rude went I went to return, she did not offer to give my money back, but only the other "bisque"  this too was not good.  We put in the garbage and were sad that we will not have a soup joint in the downtown area we will ever return.  The woman was rude and did not seem glad we were offering feedback.

I live just down the street and love the how close the Children's Museum is to our house.  We have a yearly membership that includes one adult and 2 kids.  It was $125 for the year and totally worth it, since it is $11 per person over one year old.  We go about once a month and my girls love all the activities.  From the climber to the fort room they have created a wonderful for kids to play and learn.  They also use recycled items to great unique art around the museum.  It is very clean and the staff is very friendly.  If you have children under the age of 8 this is a must do.  I would not suggest going on a First Friday or Weekend as it will be packed, but hit it up during the week. xoxo

We live in Downtown Phoenix and made the trek to Scottsdale after hearing about this spot on Arizona Midday.  It was worth the drive.  Both of the owners were running the place and providing not only great service, but wonderful and unique flavors.   I had the mint chip and chocolate brownie in a sundae and it was heavenly.  My husband tried the salty caramel and peanut butter cup, his too were amazing.  The shop is swanky and a great idea.

We stopped in this weekend to grab lunch with some friends.  Of course, since my name is "Darcy" it was kind of a fun idea.  The food was ok, I got the mac and cheese skillet which was average at best, and only over $10!  Yikes!  My husband got the fish and chips and said it was alright.    The service was average and food very overpriced.  They need to rethink their menu and pricing quick in order to survive.

We are not huge fans of chains, but this local chain knows how to do it right.  They use fresh ingredients and are always adding new items to the menu.  A few of our favs:  Taylor Ham and Egg Sandwich Turkey Waldorf Salad Beef & Cheddar Sandwich (new item) Passion Fruit Ice Tea Their bread is also amazing as well as the chocolate scones  The only area that could improve is their cookies/cupcakes..  xoxo

Even though it still feb, its was hot out today.  My family was out in the sun and all wanted to cool off a bit.  The New Orleans Sno Ball hit the spot.  The ice was the perfect consistency and allowed the tasty syrup to melt it just right.  I had the tiger's blood, my husband the hurricane and daughter black cherry.  All were great and nex time I am going to try strawberry cheesecake.   This is a must for May-Sept in Phoenix!

Not only is the carne asada amazing their refried beans are perfect.  I am sure they loaded with fat, but they taste great and their bean and cheese burrito is super tasty.  We usually get it togo, but if you stay to eat they only have cans or bottles for beverages so beware.

Looking for a true neighborhood spot where food and atmosphere are top notch? Then the Tuck Shop should be your first spot.  This place is inviting, comfortable, done well and the food and staff are amazing too! Lobster Mac & Cheese - I am mean how could you go wrong?  This it is delish.  Chicken and waffles - this ain't Lolo's (Thankfully!) great!

Found out this place is closing and I am not very surprised.  It seemed to lack a good atmosphere and the coffee was not that impressive.  Best of luck to the owners, check out Crossroads Books and Coffee to support a local shop in the burbs instead.

This hidden gem is located just across the street from my pad so short walk over and I am there.  I have only been over a few times and the shop is setup in an old historic home, the staff is super friendly, and the finds are many.  The clothes are cool and not overpriced like Buffalo Exchange.  Anytime you are looking for a few unique fun vintage/retro items to add into your wardrobe without breaking the bank hit up Butter Toast... You won't be disappointed and be sure to mention YELP for 20% discount!

I have been taking my girls to Camelback Pediatrics for almost five years.  I only have amazing things to say about this place!  I refer all my friends with kids to Camelback. The office is clean, but also old school - no toys for kids to all play with and get germs all over, the doctors all have an office in each wing of the patient rooms and over all just a cool vibe.  The staff is always friendly and welcoming.  I usually don't wait more that 15 minutes to go back, which for a doctor office lets be realistic, is amazing!   We see Dr. Alexandar and he is super caring and not "medicine happy." If your kids are sick he will prescribe something, but doesn't seem to jump the gun in issuing meds or pushing vaccines.  If you want to delay shots a bit he is totally cool with your decision.  When I have sick child they are always able to get me in that day and I really appreciate that.  For well checks you will need to schedule those in advance, but I would prefer that than not being able to get in a sick child.  Take your kids - sick or well they will take great care of them!

This is a swanky pizza/bar in the Biltmore area.  Not only are the pizza's great, but their burger is AMAZING.. It is one of my favorite in town.  They are also a good place to take the kids since they bring out gold fish as soon as you are seated.  The cons to this place is sometimes if can feel a bit stuffy and jeans and a tee will feel a bit out of place.. but this goes hand in hand with my other issue - valet parking only... Its not like the don't have much parking either (like Postino or LGO).  Just seems like they want to make it a little more swanky.

This place is decked out.  They did a great job creating that old fashioned candy shop that kids love.  Our daughter's treat is to go to Smeeks to pick out a few things to satisfy her sweet tooth!  It is a great place to find something for yourself as well - my pick would be the toffee.  They carry a few brands and it a bit pricey but worth the splurge.  I would love to someday host a kids birthday party at this location. They are a bit pricey, but otherwise we love it! Be sure to check into Stinkweeds and Frances while you are there as well.. to complete  your trifecta experience!

My husband found Go Tronics on his lunch break down at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  He had dropped my Iphone 4s when getting out of the car and the backlight and screen had been damaged.   He told me about them so I went down the next day to have them fix it. They were very professional and friendly.  It took about an hour to have it fixed so I just hung at the Mall while they were fixing it.  I have not had any issues since and even turned in an old iphone 3 for cash once I learned about their cash for old phones program.     If you have a broken phone or an old one laying around hit up Go Tronics.

I hope that Cartel sticks it out to make a lasting impression in dtphx.  There new larger space is nice, but they need to focus on making the staff friendly and knowledgeable of the area.  The coffee speaks for itself - amazing.. The atmosphere - cool.  I like that you will find the ultimate of hipster sitting next to a dressed to the nines lawyer.  I only hope they continue to pump out great coffee and just work to make the staff a bit more friendly.

This place is just down the street and a nice spot to stop in for a drink and nosh.  My husband and I stopped in awhile ago for dinner one night without the kids.  I think kids would be ok only if you are eating outside on the patio as it is a bit small and dark inside.  We had the mac and cheese which was really amazing, a touch too rich since it was pretty greasy, but really tasty as well as a sandwich which was also good.   I hope this place stays around as it fits well on 7th street and the food is worth a second visit.

Having to take a child to the ER is never something any parent wants to do, but Phoenix Children's ER made our experience as smooth as possible.   There was no wait and so they were able to get us right into a room.  They were very understanding and great with our 8 week old baby.  He was fine after being there a couple hours and they were able to discharge us with a healthy baby.  It was nice we didn't have to wait around forever once we got cleared as well.

**Update: Manager reached and they are working on making changes, giving an extra start for effort!** ___________________________________________________________  Not sure why this location seems a little lacking compared to its brother over on Camelback and its a bummer since this one is walking distance from our house, but it is..  The staff is average, the atmosphere ok, and the pizza tasty, but just not quite as good.  The parking is also a problem if you do drive, especially during a lunch break.  I hope they can step it up a bit to get back in the NYPD game.

40% off all clearance at times - yes please.  The store was well stocked with a kids and baby Gap connected - SCORE.  The staff friendly but not  over bearing.  Isaais helped us check out and was super nice and friendly my kids and I.  He even gave us a free movie coupon for the Harkins.  This will be my Gap now!

Whenever we are looking for a piece of furniture or a cool decor accent modern manor is our first stop.  They are basically a one stop shop for all mid-century modern pieces.  They are off the beaten path a bit in an warehouse just west of 7th Avenue.  The staff is always very helpful and never makes pressures you to buy.   We picked up an amazing coffee table there for only $60 since it was marked $75 but a 20% off weekend.  They have these specials often, just be sure to "like" them on facebook so you can be in the know.  The coffee table is an old chicken crate that was put on castors.  We get tons of compliments on it - since it is so unique.  (See it in the Photos with the green tray on top)

This place is great - another staple to downtown phoenix.  So hoping it sticks around and does not end up going under due to its off the beaten path location.  This place is pretty much anything you want it to be...  Boxing - Check Swing (Dancing!) Lessons - Check Old Fashion Ice Cream - Check  Awesome Bar - Check (Duce Lemonade is AMAZING)  Hula Hoops - Check  DJ - Check  Food - A-Ok, options are a bit strange  Price - A little high for the drinks and the food  Staff - super cool  CHECK IT OUT!

Went here for brunch a couple of years ago and it was pretty good, but nothing amazing.   We live just around the corner so I stopped in recently to grab a burger togo and it was AMAZING!  One of the best burgers in Phoenix!  It comes on a tasty pretzel bun and you can add this delish homemade cheese sauce that makes it!  I have been back a couple of times since then to get a burger togo and we also dined on their patio one night which was also delightful. If you live downtown hit this place up often and if you don't it's worth the drive!

SO Good.  We got into Vegas late and wanted a place where we could take our kids for a fun and tasty dinner.  The wait was only about 30 minutes at 8 pm for party of 5.  It was ok to have kids and the food was really good.  We did have to wait a long time for our food and our waitress to check back in with us.  But, it seems when in Vegas the service is not that great anywhere as so much of their customers are one time travelers.  It also helps that it is located inside the Cosmopolitan which is the greatest hotel on the strip too!

We use to make the drive to the ghetto (67th and indian school) for their great food and now they have taken over a Garcia's in the burbs.  This place is always busy!  The food is your standard tasty mexican and prices moderate.  Much better than its former the Garcia.  Check it out and see for yourself!

Looking to start a new business? Remodel a kitchen or bath? Just find a unique item?  Desert Liquidators is your place.  We scored some vintage mid-centry modern looking dining chairs there today.  We only needed a couple and they were marked $25 each, but they gave them to us for $20 each since the bottoms were missing a couple little pieces.  This place is huge and has everything including several kitchen sinks!  The staff is also helpful and friendly.  Check it!

I personally would go to Postino over Windsor, but this place comes in a close 2nd and with Churn the homemade ice cream right next door you cannot go wrong. It's gloried "Pub" food, but much pricier.  The atmosphere - 10  Food - 8 Service 7 Price - 4  I think they are a bit pricey for what you get and wished they offered discounts on food  during their AMAZING Happy Hour and not only the drinks.  We usually end up with the Pretzel and Cheese Fondue and a Burger or Sandwich.  I love that you can also get Mac and Cheese as a side and not just fries.

DELISH! This place is great! Atmosphere - 10  Ice Cream - 9  Price -  4 My husband and I split a peanut butter/chocolate lover dream sundae there and it was so so good!  The place is setup as a old fashion soda fountain/candy/ice cream shop and it is done up perfectly.  My only complaint is that it is bit pricey for what you get - so it is a bit of a splurge.

Best Donuts in Phx! I am sucker for a buttermilk bar and theirs are amazing!  They are heavy and filling not like Krispy Kreme light and airy. They also have a drive thru - making them awesome!

This place is great.  You can run through the automatic car wash for just a few bucks and get the outside nice and clean, but the real gem is the do it yourself area.  They have these great air guns that you can use to dry your car or also blow the crumbs from the little cracks in your car.  I am in love with this feature... The Clean Freak on 44th and Thomas does not have this feature, but this location does and it worth the drive.  I usually spend about $4 to have an outside wash and then use the free cleaning cloth, vacuums, and airgun to finish up the interior.  They also have monthly memberships you can buy, but with a busy family I don't have time to go enough to make that worth the money.

"Hot Mess"  I was expecting something along the lines of  an NYPD Pizza, since this is a local chain, but instead got a cool atmosphere and bad food.  The atmosphere just doesn't seem to fit the food and service vibe. It is also interesting to me that this location gets the lowest YELP score of the Humble Pies - hard to put your finger on it, but something just doesn't seem right.  We were super excited to have another spot coming to downtown phoenix, but won't be returning.  It's seat yourself when you walk in and the staff was not overly friendly at first. Once we were seated our 2nd day on the job waiter came over to take our orders.  He was friendly and got our girls some kids menus and crayons.    We ordered 2 pizzas and  a bloody Mary. My husband got the Buffalo Chicken and said it was ok and I got the sausage which came with TONS of large onions.  I asked to have a new one since the menu didn't say anything about onions, he took it and then brought it back saying no,that just fennel...um no. But, whatever! So I just picked it off. The pizza was below average and our bill was $37 before tip for just the 2 pizzas and one drink - very over priced.  Our waiter did say to the table just over from us, sorry about the wait - "It's a Hot Mess in here,or actually I am just a Hot Mess!" Um Random!  They need to cleanup their act before this location closes

We have been lost without Palette in Downtown Phx, but this place may be our new spot.  The atmosphere is great, clean modern lines and very trendy setup.  The staff very friendly the owner? walking around checking on guests to make sure everyone is pleased with their orders.  The food DELISH!  I had the plain and simple (eggs, potatoes, toast $5.50) simple and great tasting.  My husband  had the  Croquet Monsieur and loved it and for $7.50 you cannot beat it.  Great for families or meeting up with a friend.  This place is amazing and we will be back!

I am rating this in comparison to Zoyo, Mojo,and Yogurtology.   They were out of 3 different flavors - leaving mostly just the "fruity" ones. They said they are having issues with their supplier.  They also have about 1/2 of the toppings that the above 3 have and its the same price..So unless you work downtown and this is within walking distance, head over to Zoyo on 7th.

YA for downtown Phx! Glad this place seems crowded for breakfast and lunch with corporate crowd. The bakeries are amazing (brownies are super chewy and rich) and the lunch combos good too. I love that you can get 1/2 sandwich with soup, salad or WAIT Mac & Cheese!  Yes, please!  More places should follow there lead.  I am a lover of pasta, but a sammy and mac & cheese is the best of both worlds. I have used them for catering as well and they never disappoint.

AMAZING! Not just "Green" but "Organic!" Who wants to fill their home with tons of unneeded chemicals. We have the Z Gallerie Leslie Bed (A huge suede beast!) that is off-white a few years old and filled with dirt.  I called to ask if they could clean it and they said they wanted to be sure and would call me right back. The lady who answered was professional and very friendly.  She got right back and let me know they could do the bed.  It was $80 to have the bed done and about a year ago I had checked with some other companies that had quoted me $100 and that was not ORGANIC. So we had that done and also had our sectional cleaned for $150. Justin called and let me know he was on his way.  He was very friendly and explained what he would be doing and made sure to take care of our floors/walls with all the hoses he had to run up (our bedroom is on the 3rd floor).  We are very pleased with how both turned out. Give them a ring!

With Mr. Goodcents, Blimpee, and Jersey Mikes don't waste your time with Firehouse.  The atmosphere is a bit much and I didnt think the subs were anything to  return too.   The store was clean and the employees pretty nice, but the subs just not there for me.

Perfect for kids 5 and under.  They have tons of little areas that the kids can play with - from little houses to dressup and a tool area.  I usually meet a few other moms and we can sit and talk while the kids have a ton of fun and we can watch them all together in the same area.  It seems a bit pricey compared to the children's museum, but great for those under 5 and its one area vs. several spread out.  There also seem to be living social, yelp deals, and groupons to make it more cost effective.

We used them for a catering event. The food was very good and comparable to wildflower/paradise/corner bakery.  I think they a few more options of soups and salads than the competition as well.  They staff was very friendly and helpful and the dessert presentation great! We will be ordering again.

This is the jewel of Arcadia!  You can catch Caroline and her family's journey on her blog - http://www.bohofarmandhome.com/ and keep up with all the amazing events they host.  From small intimate dinners in the yard to her flea market..  Try to check one out.  This is a very unique place in the Valley of the Sun.

So happy to have Zoyo in downtown Phoenix.  I am a lover of these self serve spots that have been popping up around the valley for a few years.  I would rate Zoyo as second in command just under Yogurtology.  The reason I rank it 2nd is because they don't have an as many toppings as the ruling #1 Yogurtology.  They are in a great location, super clean, friendly staff and have several different flavors.  So hit it up after Jersey Mikes or Chipotle which are right next door or do as I did and just make it your dinner!

Welcome to Downtown!  Finally a little area with a few great chains.  They also have PARKING!  The parking is located on the east or south side of the building.  We grabbed Jersey Mike's on a Sunday afternoon and took it home to eat.  They are the best subs we have had.  They are packed with meat and cheese.  Might be little pricier then blimpie, but with it due to the over load of meat!  Check out a Jersey Mike's near you!

Love that is little local spot is a jewel among the chains that surround it on 7th Ave.  It is always busy with activity for breakfast/brunch.  Even though I am not a coffee drinker the Japanese cold brew is a favorite with my husband.  The hot chocolate we ordered for our kids was "real!" The food is reasonably priced and tasty.  The service was quick and the manager walks around checking on the tables.

KIDS CHAIRS!  They have 2 kid chairs with dvd players.  My girls think it's the best place.  They do a great job on the kids and really give them the full treatment, not like some other places that just "pretend" and then throw some polish on.  The staff is great and does NOT rush.  They told 2 customers while we were there it was gonna be at least an hour (not the normal - 10 minutes just sit and wait while we rush on the other customers to get you in!).   They took their time on everyone in our party and we also got the great hot stone treatment.  No extra charge for doing a couple of colors vs. one either. Arrowhead Tan & Nail is the place to get your next mani/pedi.

This is a new place in downtown phoenix.  The space was a little sparse/generic looking, but the staff and coffee made of for the atmosphere.  It is a large space that is also host to a church and planning concerts/first friday art.  Check it out if you work or live in downtown phx.

This place is a great for those vintage/mid century modern finds. From clothing to couches they have it all and great prices too.  They have similar items to their neighbors Modern Manor, but not the "designer" prices.  We got a green vintage chair for $98 and just are having the skirt around the bottom removed to show the great legs on it.  We will always check back at Melrose when looking for unique pieces for our home.

Favorite place in phoenix.   I am not a huge pizza fan and for me its not the pizza that makes this place.  Now the burrata cheese appetizer and chocolate dessert are what do it for me.  The burrata is amazing!  We normally don't get appetizers but went for a special occasion so decided to go all in.  The burrata is one of my fav dishes in phx.  The dessert would be my #1 fav dessert in phoenix.  The oreo crust, amazing chocolate mousse and then marshmallow topping is to die for.  Its even better than the Citizen Public Houses similar offering.

We stopped in this weekend to grab a quick bite togo.  The staff were much friendly than the last owners who were more like the "no soup for you crew."  I ordered a brat meal with chips and a drink for $5 for my husband and told them to top it and make how they like it best - good decision he loved it.  I also ordered 2 deli sandwiches for my girls and I.  The bread was good - soft and bit chewy.  The meat was fresh and plentiful.  We would stop in again and maybe even grab some of the meats to use at home in our cooking.

Pretty solid burger/milkshake.   I did order 2 tacos (short rib and chicken) only to find out that once home they had given me just 2 veggie ones.  Even my meat lover brother in law enjoyed the veggie tacos and my daughter and I found the milk shake and burger good.  A little pricey, but overall tasty and a nice addition to Arcadia.

Professional and Friendly We moved to a new place in downtown Phoenix where roaches are plenty! SO GROSS. We called Insectek and they were able to come out that day!  Lucio was professional and friendly.  He spent time looking into where they could be coming in and talking about how to fix those problem areas first.  He then spent over an hour spraying the house and cleaning the eves and windows for spider webs.  He saw we had young kids and was confirmed the products were safe and how long to keep the kids away from certain areas. They did a followup call to make sure we were happy with the service and if we needed anything else. They just called to confirm our next appt and again see if we needed anything.   A+ Company

Well, this is not a "5" star like it's sister St. Francis, but really close.  The atmosphere is great.  Long picnic tables with low lighting and you counter order.  The food was ok, just not as mouth watering at St. Francis.  It was also a bummer that kids did not eat for free.  I would also like to see a few more items on the menu. The s'more cookie we got for free with our Yelp check in was super tasty.

So glad that Biltmore has a Chick-Fil-A Gem!  We were invited to a private opening dinner.  It was so great, they even had a red carpet!  They seated all the guests and then proceeded to serve samples of many of their items.   The decor/design is great as it is more "urban!"  We will be hitting us this hot spot often.

Not only are the hot dogs so fun and unique the staff is friendly and owners responsive.  We have hit up short leash for a quick dinner a few times and also had them bring the truck to an event for our church.  They were super friendly helpful and served up tasty dogs for our entire group. If looking for a fun dinner with the family or to cater a large group check out Short Leash.

A+ Company Professional and Friendly!  Looking for some great commercial shots?  Dave is your guy.  We have used him at the Hyatt Regency Phoenix to take photos of employee events, head shots, and food photos. He goes above and beyond to get that perfect shot.  He is professional, arrives early, and has speedy turnaround. We always get our amazing pictures within a week or less of the shoot. You would make a mistake to call anyone else.

Hidden Jewel in dtphx!  Perfect spot to grab a super tasty lunch or dinner before a Suns or Dbacks game.  This place is in the old Cartel spot.  It is cozy but comfortable and inviting.  Both times I have dined there the staff is super friendly.  The pizza is AMAZING.  I would rank local joints like this:  1) Bianco's 2) La Piazza Locale 3) Federal Pizza 4) The Parlor 5) Cibo 6) Pomo So since Bianco's is ranked nationally this place is holding its own in a close 2nd.   Check it out ASAP.

We went to Joyride with some friends for Happy Hour on a Sunday afternoon.  Upward Projects does it again with this amazing place.  The layout and decor is done perfectly with no expense spared.  It is a fun joyful atmosphere that is lively by not too loud.   Our waiter was very friendly and outgoing as he suggested drinks to our group.  I had the strawberry Aguas Freshcas with rum and my husband had the Mazatlan Mule.  We also shared the Better than Betty's chocolate dessert which was the perfect way to end Happy Hour.  I am sure we will be back for Happy Hour and maybe try out some more of the food next time too.

Love that downtown Phoenix has this amazing place!!  We will be sure to bring all our out of town guests to this gem. I think this place will be around for many years and has helped to change and shape downtown. The atmosphere was hip, service good, food unique and tasty, and drinks in a league of there own. Keep pumping out the awesomeness!

Well it's a new year so time to get you a new body!  Looking for a workout that will get you fit and trim and won't kill you?  I have been a member at the YMCA and LA Fitness for years, but not until I had Drew train me did I really see results.  I actually liked wearing tank tops and shorts with my newly toned body!  If you are looking for results that won't break the bank - be sure to check this place out ASAP!
