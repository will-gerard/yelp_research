you know how sometimes in people the outside does not match the inside, this is this restaurant's case. The outside does not match the inside. Meaning the inside is better! Ending up in there not intentionally but as a decision made literally in a second "there!"  (as I pointed w/my index)  - Ambiance is awesome, it feels like true Italy (to me) this includes the awesome decor, this was the "ah! factor" so much to look at! and Italian classic music was a plus!   - Service: great! not sure if it was the time and date or what but it was good (I note this because according to other reviews this has been the flaw)   - Food: great, almost awesome, classic and big portions  Overall, a great experience, a definite come-back and I would suggest the outside expresses more of what the inside is!

I thought I was going there for the kids fun and for good food...and I was right!  Yes it looks fun, yes it's great atmosphere, yes there's much to see, yes...yes... yes...  now! food-wise... I was amazed to have good food. I had Chicken Alfredo and It was just right! huge portion and what kick it up a notch was the HOT ROSEMARY FOCACIA BREAD!   we all won! kids had fun and mom had good food. I will come again for a special occasion since it is a bit pricey - I must say The end :)

I thought I loved you before I met you!!!  and I will never know....  Couldn't get in because we didn't had a badge (?) WTF, even the host had a question face..... and asked the two guys guarding the door to let us in, they said we needed the badge. I was thrilled to try this restaurant, but I will never come back.   Two thumbs down! boooo
