My husband and I stayed here over the weekend. We loved it! Our room was very clean which is most important to me in any hotel. Beds were comfy with plenty of extra pillows. I did not get some of the complaints I saw with others for size of the room. I would say pretty standard to most hotels. You can generally expect rooms and bathrooms to be smaller than modern places in historic hotels.I love that they keep things original as they can.Staff was really friendly. We felt very welcome and relaxed. We took the ghost tour. Our guide was very nice. She let us roam around as we wished to take pictures. We stayed in 218. On this night all the suites were unavailable. I would like to go back and try one of the suites next time.I forgot there was a pool so I did not bring a suit.Very nice pool. We did go check it out. Next time. I thought the room was priced very well. There is a bar in the hotel. We did hear the music until 2 am however, I did not find it to be so loud I could not go to sleep. Everything was completely quiet past 2 am. Sadly we did not find any ghosts. Maybe next time!

THIS PLACE NEEDS A MINUS 1 because I so have a beef with this restaurant. My husband loves steak. usually I am not a huge fan of going to a steakhouse but it was my husbands turn to choose so I insisted we go. It is not that I do not like steak only that I often find I prefer the steaks I grill at home to the ones served  out. I do however lloooove the fried onions alot of the steak places have but this one did not have one. BOO! Anyhoo......we decided to order what was supposed to be garlic-peppered fried zucchinn. It was fried nicely and not too oily, but I did not taste garlic or any pepper in the seasoning. It came oddly with a cucumber dip (I think it was creamy cucumber dressing) we asked for ranch instead. It just tasted off. I ordered  a grilled chicken breast that was supposed to be seasoned with rosemary and spices well again, no rosemary. My chicken was dry and boring. I ate maybe half of it.It came with a side of broccoli and what was supposed to be GARLIC MASHED POTATOES also another popular side item at most steakhouses. AGAIN, nothing but bad to say about both these items. FIRST. Frozen cut broccoli should never be served  at any restaurant. I only eat fresh steamed broccoli.When you list on the menu fresh seasoned veg of the day I think it will be just that fresh. Next, garlic mashed potatoes. Anyone that loves these knows they are made with cream and garlic and should be creamy comforting goodness. These potatoes were like I nuked a potato dumped the  insides on my plate and smashed it with some butter and garlic salt. When I  asksed the server about them because I refused to eat them , she said "oh yes no we don't make them that way here we leave out cream because people have allergies" OMG! What a joke! CREAM is the best thing about em! what would be the point otherwise?I told them they should tell people this before they order. She asked me if I wanted a baked potato instead. I looked at her and said" that is what I have all I need is to add sourcream".(I don't think she liked me)  Oh but wait my husbands was no better. He ordered prime rib. They brought it out fully cooked! The server acted annoyed we complained about it.They brought out another piece- we waited another 20 for that and then they did not even offer to dicount our meal. In fact a manager never even came to talk to us even though I know the server did talk to him about our meal. Good service to me is even more important than food at times.I would NEVER GO BACK HERE. Mcdonalds would have tasted better. So I will be sticking with OUTBACK. At least they got the onion!

I love Valle Luna! I only give 4 stars because they don't blow me away good. We have so many mexican restarants in the valley to choose from  but what does impress me is that every time I have gone, the food is consistently good.Good chips and salsa which is very important. I love the margaritas there because they are never watered down tasting in fact, they tend to be a little heavy on the liquor which is a good thing but know that  before you plan to drive. I personally don't drink if I am so I always go there and make my husband drive ;-) It is a great place to meet people for food and drinks because they never rush you and it is very relaxed and friendly there. I for one will keep going

well, maybe it was the  time I went or what I had but I would have to give them about the same rating as I would give red lobster. I can't understand how anyone could like Red lobster if you know what good seafood is.I was born and grew up with family from Baltimore Maryland where good seafood is what the city is about.I was excited to try it as I love seafood but my food just was not good. I can't say my service was all the great either. I would not go again

To be fair if possible I would give it 2 and1/2 stars if possible. I don'.t dislike it.I just don't like it enough to pick it over other options. It could just be so much better! What Lunch as far as sandwiches and fries are good and typical of most diners. Dinner is not good at all. I can't tell anyone to eat dinner here. I had fish dinner. Mine was meh at best. Fish was okay. Did not like tartar sauce. My husband was excited to get his fried chicken dinner but it was not good. I tasted it. The chicken did not seem to be seasoned much. Very bland and not a good texture at all. The mashed potatoes were real but the gravy was breakfast white gravy from a package.Or that is what it seemed to be. His green beans were not seasoned at all. Not happy with our dinners. We thought we might be better with dessert. I have in the past had good cake here. A lemon cake I had once was good. We on this night ordered coconut pie. It was like eating packed toasted coconut. I kept trying to find the filling and thought it had to have been an ooops. I told the server about it but she just said she was sorry we did not like it and cleared it. We were still charged. Took 2 bites. One for my husband and myself. Maybe things will get better. I am not sure when I will go back to find out unless a friend picks the place.Work on the menu and your pies. This place has the potential to be such a cute little find if worked on.

I now see my daughter and I are not the only ones to receive bad service here.  So sad since this place had the potential of being a real find. My daughter and I went here on a girls day out. We were at first excited to see the display case full of beautiful looking desserts. I had creme brulee. It was pretty good. My daughter ordered this chocolate shell tart with what was described as a white chocolate filling. It did not taste like white chocolate at all and it actually had the texture of Crisco shortening. Yes shortening!! Not at all what you want in a dessert.My daughter took one bite and put it down. I tasted it to see if it really was as bad as she said and I had to agree. No problem. I told my daughter "I am sure when the server comes back they will let you exchange it". When the server came back  she only said "Oh I am sorry you did not like it " and took it away. She came back with the bill with both desserts on it. She never asked us if we would like to exchange for something else. When I looked at the bill I said my daughter did not like her dessert could she have something else? She said she would have to "add it to my tickett". I told her it was not polite for her to ask us to pay for a dessert that clearly she only took one bite of because it was not good. She said it was policy to not take things off the bill just because someon did not like it. So...just like other reviews here I will not be back. If the customer does not like it. They don't like it. If they think you are rude and have terrible manners they won't be back.Your service always has to be as good as your food! If you don't even have good service you have nothing! You lose! Not a new concept.

Yesterday we decided since we were all home together and I did not want to heat up the house cooking, we would go out to dinner and a movie. I told my husband I wanted to try the landmark because I wanted to check it out myself based on the reviews. Sorry guys if I offend any of you I see many of you really like it but honesty is policy here I would imagine so honesty is what you get. I have to agree with Sarah G.I was not that excited about the salad room. Some of the things were ok, I liked the german potato salad (although my german potato salad is so much better) Actually I have had better salad choices at say a golden corral. for the hot choices they had meatballs in tomato sauce, bbq chicken pieces, what they said was a southwest chili that looked like it had been cooking for 2 days and  the german potato salad. That was it. Two soups, vegetable and beef mushroom. Did not care for these. I made a basic salad and ate a couple pasta salads and the german potato salad that is really all that looked good in there. (Unless of course you like boiled quail eggs, cactus salad or pickled herring)My husband ordered pot roast, that was good but nothing sensational average if you ask me. Daughter had chicken fried steak, again ok but nothing I could not get at cracker barrel in fact I would compare it to there. Two boys got beef stroganoff which again was only ok but nothing to write mom about. I also have to agree while the experience of visiting the building is interesting, those plastic domes to cover your food have got to go! I have worked in assisted living homes and that is what it brought me back to.The food itself did look institutional. If I did ever go back, it would not be for me. I would imagine it would be a good where to take mom or grandma place.I would have to hide the menu prices from here because she would refuse to order, but I think she would like it.They are a bit pricey in my opinion.In fact, I think my mom would enjoy it she loves old buildings with victorian charm.

Love Kirklands! I love that I can find really nice decorations for my home without breaking the bank. They have a really nice selection and everyone can find something nice for a gift  that fits their budget. They have inexpensive decor but it does not look cheap.Now I have Hobby Lobby and Kirklands  yay!

I was a little surprised I must say to see that Joes for some here got such low scores. Yes  I  guess the flies and the noise can be a bit bothersome, but for me it is all about the food and that is awesome! I absolutely love love the onion rings there. It is hard to find really good onion rings these days. I had family recently come in and we had so much food on the table I was afraid someone was going to start oinking  at us. Fried zucchinni is also probably the very best I have ever had and the fries !awesome! How do they get them so crispy? Fontina burger is AMAZing! I will definitely keep going there!

Cantina Laredo I was sooo expecting more! Now looking through most of your reviews I see I am not the only one. The place looks nice from the outside and yout expect it  might be good. It is not. It was not even ok in my opinion. Very bland. The chips and salsa were good but that was only thing. My husband ordered a sampler platter they had. Everything was so plain and tasteless and dry. I am a season everything well kind of girl. I ordered the Sea bass. It was ok, but definitely not worth $24 I think the plate was. The steamed veggies that came with were frozen cooked to mush with a lemon slice on top. Pricey and food not very good a combination that never take me back. I don't mind paying for something...but give me quality worth the price. I left mad thinking of all the things I could have spent that $67 on

Went out wiith hubby and two great friends to Sat to San Tan Flat. I am going to give 4 stars because I am  definitely a fan of this place. I love the fun atmosphere. I love the live music. I also love that it is close to my house. The owner is awesome, could not meet a nicer guy and normally I like most of the staff as well. The last couple visits though, Sat included my visit has not been as enjoyable as it used to be. For those that do not know me, just trust me when I say that I am anything but a hard to please person. I am a very friendly  person as well . I don't know why but the last couple visits the staff there has just not been very friendly. I ordered a drink from the bar and the girl there that took my order did not smile or even look up hardly when I smiled and  ordered a margarita on the rocks with extra salt.I then thought oh maybe she is just distracted so I smiled again and said Thankyou  and she still barely looked up and said mm hmm in a sort of annoyed tone.Even at checkout(we had a tab) she was her unfriendly self.The other bar tender I noticed with other people was not much better. My husband even tipped her well, against my advice since the drinks were lousy. My friends and hubby had beer. Normally I order margaritas they are my fave. The drink was not so good and at $8 a drink it should not taste like it is watered lemonade. I ordered a second thinking maybe it will be better second time. Nope still the same. Maybe the owner needs to talk to his people about the service and the drinks.(I also recall every awesome drink I have ever had he has been there)One of the things I have always liked about the place is that is seems like a good hangout.I am from Oklahoma where everyone is your friend until you give them a reason not to be.I don't like snotty bars. I like real fun friendly places. We love this place though hopefully things will go back to what they used to be

My husband and I visited the olive mill this morning. We decided to go there after finding reviews on here so Thankyou! It is kind of funny also since we live in Circle Cross Ranch which is just right up the road from QCOM. I have passed this building so many times and just tossed it up to another little local farm out here. First we sampled all the olives and the different oils and dipping sauces. My husband complained he thinks the products are overpriced but I thought they were reasonable since they are really good and don't taste anything like the stuff you get in the supermarkets. After selecting a few items, I bought the mesquite almond stuffed olives and lemon and blood orange olive oils. Blood orange is amazing I can't wait to try it on a salad. I also bought a plain virgin olive oil.The oil is so flavorful and their claim is it is pesticide free since they don't have a problem with some sort of fruit fly they normally have problems with in olives here because of our dry hot climate. We decided to grab a bite. This was the only problem, not for me but for my husband. I guess this is a perfect place for the girls to get together for lunch but if you have a man that has a pretty hearty appetite like mine then he may not quite be satisfied with what he receives.It was perfect for me. I ordered a paninni that had roasted squash, peppers, arugula, fennel garlic aoli and a parmesan balsamic sauce on it. It was very good. Came with a side of kettle style potato chips and some olives. He had a salad but truthfully it was not a very big salad especially with the salads that could serve 3 you mostly see these days. I guess it is true Americans have come to expect quantity.That is ok, I would definitely go back. I will just have to make sure I leave him at home next time and go with one of my gals instead

yahoo! was I ever happy that we finally have HOBBY LOBBY ! My husband...not so happy since this means I will be shopping more. (sorry honey if you are reading) LOL I grew up with Hobby Lobby being raised in Oklahoma where the store originated. The checkout process needs some work as they never seem to have enough checkers. Of course where do they these days now that I am thinking about it? I am sure with time they are new it will all get better. I am just so glad to have them. I used to have to go home, shop and then try to find a way to ship my finds.I am giving them a 4 because 5 would to me mean excellent customer service but I doubt it would even be possible to get many 5s from me on that. Customer service sadly seems to be from a bygone era. If you go to their website and sign up they will send the sales.

I had noticed  this place and had been meaning for awhile to try it but forgot about it until a week ago when I was at the San Tan mall shopping. I told my hubby we would try soon to go there and it happened to be today. OMG I can't believe I did not try this place sooner! Food was absolutely fabulous! It is even close to us YEAH!We loved the decor and the staff were very nice and accomodating. We had the spicy shrimp and eggplant app to start. Heaven on a plate! In fact, our server told us in the future we could ask to have this served with pasta and asparagus as a main dish in the future. (I guess this is popular among staff) The sauce is wonderful. I so wish I could get the recipe. Eggplant was cooked crispy to pefection.Topped with a single perfectly cooked shrimp. The sauce is so Yummy! Creamy, hint of wine.Has a bit of spice to it. Loved the bit of heat that lingers in the back or your throat.We lapped up every last drop of the sauce with extra bread she brought us. Today we brought our two kids. I had a hard time deciding what to order so it was good we were all together to sample each others dishes. I had the mediterranean pasta.Wonderful. Plenty of garlic. Feta cheese, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes spinach, pinenuts and plenty of basil. Nice and light. Daughter had the pasta with vodka sauce,Her pasta was perfect. Shaped like a little sache. Perfect texture with the wonderful Vodka sauce. Son had braised beef fettucini.The beef portions were like butter. If I had no teeth I still would have been okay. Lastly hubby had the mushroom ravioli. Creamy and rich, but not overly rich. Nice sprinkling of panko on top. I loved that the ravioli was not overloaded with cheese. I like tasting the mushroom.All were excellent. It would be really hard to decide which I liked best. Every dish was diffferent and full of favor.Prob would be difficult going there in the future without the 4 of us  if I had to decide on one dish. I am  almost embarrased to say we all cleaned our plates. However,don't be scared for my waist line, this was our only meal for the day. We ate our days worth :) Dont worry kids did eat light dinner) We decided we could not leave without trying dessert. We ordered the creme brulee trio and a single serv of cheesecake. The small servings are perfect. Creme brulee was light and lovely. Dinner with tip for 4 was$104.Not something we could do every week however when I go out I want it to be worth my money.Would definitely be a great place to take a date or to impress family or business clients.  We will definitely go back. My birthday is in a few weeks ;)

We really enjoy this place. Great family owned business. They are so friendly and wanting to please their customers. I usually order the vegetarian pita. My husband is a gyro fan. Salads are fresh and I love the dressing. I try so hard to not order these..but sometimes ya just gotta indulge....THE GREEK FRIES! Yum! I could eat these everyday if I did not care about my waist line. Seriously yummy. We enjoy going to family owned places as to the big chain restaurants. There is nothing fancy about it. In fact, it used to be a hotdog shop. I think sometimes that is the charm of a place.Do try if you have never been here.

My family loves this place! The food is always fresh and cooked to order.The best hawaiian bbq I have had in the valley. I have such a hard time deciding what to order when I go because everything I have tried is so good. Now we decided it is best to order combinations. Everyone in our family order a diffrrent one and share it. :-) The first time we ate here we liked it so much we were back the next day.The chicken bbq, and bbq pork I think might be my favorite. However, then...I have to have the adobo too. The only thing I have not tried yet is the fish. That is next.  I think prices are very reasonable.Service is excellent. So nice and friendly there. They even offer catering or pick up tray orders so you can plan your next party. We are planning on this for our next party.I really hope this place stays because I love it. So tired of seeing things I like come and go in the san Tan Valley/Queen Creek area. Come on everyone start supporting family owned business! We want them to stay!
