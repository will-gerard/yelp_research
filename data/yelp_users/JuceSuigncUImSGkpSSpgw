Once Native Newyorker, now Native. Once had delicious juicy wings, now the worst wings I've ever had. Having once worked for this company, I remember the food being so good. Tonight was an extreme disappointment! Most of my wings were so tiny, like they came from a new born chick. They were tasteless, even with the flavors I choose. The price of the food was a little high. They now charge 89 cents per wing if you don't get their "pack" deal. I was not impressed at all and do not plan on returning. Ever since the company got bought out the quality of their food has fell short of any sane person's standards.    On a brighter note, the waiter (Nate) was very pleasant. He was attentive and kind. Only gave two stars because of his customer service.

Excellent customer service is imperative, this location does not have that. Visited this location on 4/29/14 around 10:45PM and the girl that took our order was rude. I'm chalking down that she hates her job and probably her life. Granted, she did say "thank you" once, so she has some hope of success in customer service. It's nice this location is open 24hr and 70% of the time they get your order right. I'll drive to another location for my hungover needs.

This has got to be one of the worst Wal-Mart's I have ever been to. My friend just moved to this neighborhood so we decided to go to this Wal-Mart so he could get some items for his new home. It was late, around 11:40PM. We needed to get some things from electronics but when we got to that department we realized they had it blocked off. We asked what was going on and they told us that their location now shuts down electronics at 11PM. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! THIS IS WAL-MART! The point of having a 24 hour location is for convenience. They even had the makeup department shut down too.   Which brings me to why I'm giving this location 2 stars instead of 1. I went up to an employee (SWEETEST MAN EVER!) and ask if he would let me go into the makeup department and get the face lotion that I had primary came to Wal-Mart for. This employee knew he shouldn't and even stated he wasn't suppose to, YET he still allowed me to go in there and get the lotion I came for. The fact that he risked getting in trouble to help me find what I needed blew my mind. That man deserves to work for a better company, a company that appreciates their employees that actually care about their customers. That's what I consider going the extra mile. HE DESERVES A RAISE! I wish I knew his name, all I know is that he was restocking the lotion when I approached him and he told me he just got back from vacation so he wasn't entirely certain why they had shut down those departments at 11PM.  Do yourself a favor and NEVER go to this Wal-Mart unless you want to talk to that AWESOME employee.

-Amazing food! -Amazing staff! -Fairly decent prices for subs. -When asked for your name, if you tell them your name is "Darth Vader", they are going to call you "Darth Vader". WINNING! -This place obviously has a sense of humor. -Relaxed environment.  -Food is fresh and made to order. -Fast service! -They even serve beer which I have yet to try. Nonetheless, that's brilliant!  -Music they play= YESSSSS!!!! -They are involved with the community by allowing local artists and companies to display their flyers or business cards. -Next time you order here, read the stickers they have on the glass... you'll giggle.

I've been to many nail techs but none of them have delivered like Brandy Sucher. Every time I get a gel (shellac) manicure or pedicure from her they last for many weeks! I don't have to worry about my nails chipping the next day and having to travel back to the salon just to get it fixed. Not to mention, Brandy is very creative! Every nail design I've had from her is always followed by tons of compliments. I refuse to go to any other nail tech because Brandy knows what she's doing, she remembers what I like, and she's always easy to talk to. She offers amazing $20 shellac manicures, which is phenomenal deal compared to other salons. If you're looking for quality nail service for a reasonable price then you should definitely schedule an appointment with Brandy.

Once again Brandy has delivered excellence! I got hard gel extensions and I'm in love! They're beautiful and the compliments never stop! Thank you, Brandy!

Pro: Food is good when it's hot. Recommend dining in or pick up ONLY.  Cons: Have ordered delivery five times. Three out of five my food has arrived cold and/or late (once it was 30 mins in addition to the 45 mins that was estimated). The female manager is not professional, wish I cared to have remembered her name. Once they offered to replace my order but I had waited so long that I didn't want to wait again. Used a coupon to get a free drink and they forgot my drink. Have spoke to management several times about my issues and have never felt like my issues were resolved. Was told a manager would contact me, they never called. After having three strikes with this company I will NEVER order from them again. Not because their food is bad but because they have TERRIBLE customer service. It's a bummer because I really do enjoy their food when it's fresh and they are only two miles from my home. I much rather drive 15 mins to a competitor than give them my business.

I have no idea why the photo to this Wal Mart displays "SUPERCENTER". This has got to be the tiniest Wal Mart known to man! The parking lot was designed terribly! They rarely have what I want stocked on the shelves. Terrible customer service-sometimes the cashiers ask if I found everything alright. DO NOT go here during the day! Besides battling for a parking spot you will also find yourself waiting in line FOREVER! They do not utilize back up cashiers whatsoever! Why is this the only Wal Mart in Tempe besides the even tinier college location!??! I now drive to Mesa Riverview Wal Mart for all my Wal Mart needs. If you're reading this, I suggest you do the same.

I've been going to Jamba Juice for years. I absolutely love their products! Went to this location today to take advantage of the buy one get one promotion. Cornelius, training store manager, took our order. I asked if he needed to see the coupon I had on my phone for the Bogo deal and he said yes. He was thorough and read us back our order to ensure accuracy. There were two ladies behind us waiting to order and I told them about the Bogo deal, love helping others save money. I let them us my phone to show Cornelius but he said they couldn't use it. They did not bring their phones in so they couldn't download the app I was using for the coupon. I was very disappointed at first and unsure why he wouldn't let them, it wasn't a coupon that needed to be scanned. Most companies I've dealt with in the past with similar coupons have allowed me to share it. I was sure I was going to have to write a bad review about him until the ladies thank me after ordering and informed me that he ended up giving them the Bogo deal. THANKS CORNELIUS!! This review only gets four stars because we waited a while before getting our drinks. Because of Cornelius's change of heart I will definitely return to this location.

I come to this bank almost everyday to make the deposit for my work. The staff here is extremely pleasant! They are attentive and very kind. Even though I'm not currently a Wells Fargo customer, I plan to be. These people really know how to treat their customers.

My least favorite location so far. I specifically asked for extra ingredients on my sub and somehow the guy only heard 50% of what I said, even though we went into detail explanation about said ingredients. I probably wouldn't be as upset if he choose not to hear the two ingredients they did put on my sub versus the two ingredients they didn't. In essence I paid for something I didn't want. I'm not surprised though, the guy that took my order looked high as hell. Next time I crave Jimmy John's I'll drive to a location that gets my order right.

Jessika is the best piercer on planet earth! I wouldn't trust anybody but her to stab me with needles. She's very personable and makes me feel very welcomed every time I visit her. She's what I refer to as a "piercing ninja'. She knows what she's doing and she does it well. I have had several piercings done by yours truly and have never had a problem with the healing process. She never fails to educate me on my piercing of choice as well as after care. If you're looking for a great piercing experience, go to Jess! Trust me, I've been going to this wonderful lady for years and won't go to anyone else.

The staff here is VERY friendly! It's always a pleasure to hear them say, "My pleasure!" Restaurant is always clean and the decor has a new-age style. Food is ALWAYS amazing! One time I ordered extra pickles on my number one and they didn't give me extra pickles. I called the store and spoke to management. They apologized and offered to send me coupons in the mail for my troubles. I received those coupons within a week with a hand written letter from John, the office supervisor, apologizing for forgetting the extra pickles. I was blown away by their excellent customer service! I will definitely return in the near future!

I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to write a review for Third Eye Body Art! My experience was phenomenal and I can't wait to return. I've had many piercings done at several shops throughout Arizona, this was by far one of the best experiences. Rob (Shop Owner/Piercer) was very inviting from the moment I walked in the door. He is very knowledgable and informative, he definitely knows what he's doing.   The shop: It's fairly new, but I already like the direction they are going with their decor. They have custom art from local artists that you have to check out! Very clean, you can tell they pride themselves in keeping the shop sterile. They also have mints for their guests. Winning!   The jewelry: Absolutely beautiful! You can tell it's high quality, which I love! Yes, the jewelry is more expensive than most shops, but you get what you pay for. I've learned this the hard way at other shops and don't care to make that mistake again. I'm happy to know that this shop uses only the best.  The piercing process: The moment I sat down I was at ease. Rob was kind enough to talk me through his piercing process as well as make me laugh. I felt safe knowing I was getting pierced by a professional. All together everything went very smooth. I didn't cry, so that's a plus. :)  If I could give this review 10 stars I would. Unfortunately, Yelp has star limitations. Thank you Rob for making my birthday wonderful and special! I will be returning soon for a new fancy clicker for my septum.
