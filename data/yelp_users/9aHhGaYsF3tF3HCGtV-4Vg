I have NEVER in my life had as bad of an experience at a nail salon in my life.  My daughter had been getting her nails done here for the past few months.  Though I didn't think they did the best job, it was very conveniently located to my house.  This weekend we arrived for our nails and they were completely not ready for us and were quite rude.  She needed a fill and instead covered her acrylic nails with gel on top.  They looked horrible and started peeling that night!  When I went in to have her nails fixed they were awful..... I want everyone to be warned!!! I have never written a poor yelp review but felt so compelled this time!!!!

I have had 4 shoulder surgeries and I have tried every method of treatment imaginable from physical therapy to chiropractic to Accupuncture to trainers.. Grigor is the first person who was really successful at relieving my pain....
