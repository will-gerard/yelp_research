Never a bad experience when flying out of here! Lines are never crazy, employees are always busy and working hard and the recent renovations over the years have made flying out of here so much more enjoyable.  From the more trendier restaurants (that are not chains), from the convenience stores to the charging stations set up for all to charge devices while waiting...Sky Harbor is one of my favorite airports to frequent.

Had the best experience with the staff at this Dollar Store! Called ahead to see if they had blue silly string (needed for a gender reveal party). I needed a large amount and they were able to round up 35 cans and had them boxed and waiting for me when I picked them up this afternoon. They were so polite and went the extra mile to help me. Would highly recommend this location and will return!

Pizza was incredible as I remember! The beer selection is awesome as well but the service was just par tonight. With a little improvement to the wait staff, this could easily be a five star review! We still plan on returning, regardless.

Can't say enough good things about this place! Their bagels are better then anyone else's in the valley! And their breakfast sandwiches are to die for!

I visited this DQ a couple months ago and had a bad experience (was not Yelped) and was in the area last night so I talked the wife into trying it again.  Unfortunately, it was another bad experience!  We ordered in the drive thru as we normally do.  The person working the window took my card, closed the window and was gone for about 3-5 minutes.  He opened the window back up, gave me my card and our order. I started to drive away and he yelled wait.  The car behind me moved so I parked and went in.  He advised he had not swiped my card so the order was not paid for. I waited at the counter an additional 5 minutes while they proceeded to help other customers (meanwhile our order of two blizzards is melting! We get home and the lids were not on the cups right, there was ice cream all over the cups and it was just a mess!  I think I will avoid this DQ moving forward.

Can't go wrong with the traditional pizza and wings! That is always a family favorite of ours when we go to Pullano's.  The staff is always so friendly and attentive, the food is always delicious and flavorful and the beer is always ice cold!

I've been coming here for years and wouldn't wanna call any other church my home! The pastor is so personable and there's never a dull moment when he's preaching. The rest of the staff is also incredible and always goes out of their way to make you feel at home and welcomed! Come check out CCC and you'll see why I love starting my weeks off here every Sunday!

First time there and didn't really know what to expect. It was definitely a cool concept and I would probably return.  We went with a decent size party which might have hindered us in trying to get drinks or a table as seating was limited.  Still worth checking out nonetheless.

The customer service was poor and our room was outdated! We thought it would be a nice staycation for our anniversary and boy was I wrong! I'll probably be on trip planning restriction after this one!   However if you do stay; make sure you upgrade to the remodeled rooms and you avoid the bar at the Lariat.

Always a pleasurable experience at Chase Field. I love the upgrades they are making in there from the tvs and standing room tables to the restaurants that are more catered to great, local eateries. The typical ballpark food is incredible here as well from the Sonoran Dog to the Dbacks Dog!

Always great food, drinks and service when we come here! OTH is one of our favor our restaurants to dine at.   Tonight's visit was no different but I must apologize to our waitress, Jade. We were on the patio and there was a very rude couple amongst us. Everyone around us could tell and on our way out; I told them they shouldn't be so rude to their waitress. They tried making a scene as we exited and I just wanted Jade to know how sorry I am for putting her in that awkward position. She was great!

Usually after leaving here; if give RR 3-4 stars but our waitress was incredible! We loved having Rachel as our waitress! She was friendly, happy and just a pleasure to be around! Our order was right, food was delicious and we couldn't be happier! Wish every server was as good as she was!

The food and drinks were great but what made me decide to give 5 stars was the service! Our waitress (Morgan) was incredible! Polite, prompt and made our meal as good as it was! We will definitely be returning to Margaritaville!

The only reason Im giving this two stars is because our waitress was great and her customer service was outstanding.  Other then that, everything was horrible.  Everyone's steaks were tough, over cooked and had no flavor.  Our whole party ordered their steaks either medium to medium rare and they were all cooked thoroughly through with not even the slightest amount of pink showing.  The side dishes were okay but the mashed potatoes seemed dry too!  Hey, at least the beer was cold and refreshing.  We definitely wont be returning to Logan's anytime soon! Did not leave much to be desired.

This would be a 5 star theater except every time we go and stop at the concession stand, it ends up being a joke! Not sure why these kids cant take the time and actually wipe the side of the cup for you. I mean soda is pouring out the top and it's dripping yet you put it in my hand? And when I asked if they could wipe my cup off...I get the deer in the headlights look!

Just tried their new Pan pizza and it is absolutely incredible! Love Papa Murphy's and this new pan pizza is the perfect addition to their already awesome menu!  Pan pep, cheesy bread and some Mountain Dew for $15...can't go wrong with that!

This place is amazing! Not only do they have some of the most delicious food I have ever had the pleasure of tasting; but their happy hour was to die for too! I'd highly recommend the street tacos! Great staff, great food, great drinks at a great location! Will be recommending Venues to all my friends and family.

What is there to say about this place that hasn't already been said? My wife and I tried Paradise Valley Burger Co last night after a coworker recommended it! This place is a hidden gem! I cannot wait to go back there again! I had the Burger Brulee while my wife had the Beach a House. We split an order of sweet potato tots as well as a Lucky Charms milkshake for desert. Words cannot describe how delicious this place is! I highly recommend checking out PVBC!

Prime Auto Glass and Ana are on point!  They made this such a pleasurable experience.  They called and had my insurance co on the phone, set everything up, were flexible and expedited us due to scheduling conflicts. I would HIGHLY recommend them! Fast, professional and polite! Got paid cash on scene too! :)

I will never drink or eat here! Between waiting at the bar over five minutes to be waited on, to having the manager serve us, to not bring acknowledged the entire time we sat there with empty drinks. No one bothered checking on us, refilling our drinks, etc. Worst service! Tempted to check out!

I usually get dogs here but last night I tried the Italian Beef sandwich with the cheese fries and I must say it was incredible! Filled with so much flavor! That was hands down one of the best Italian Beef sandwiches I've had in a long time! Portillo's never disappoints!

It's been awhile since I've been to Which Wich which probably makes me enjoy it that much more! Ventured out from my norm last night and tried the South Philly cheesesteak and I must say it was phenomenal! Their sandwiches are always on point and love how they keep the menu creative!

My wife and I were debating for our anniversary dinner if we wanted a good view or a good steak. We both decided on the steak and after doing some research, decided upon Steak 44.   This was our first time here and we were blown away not only by the food and drinks but by how hospitable the entire staff was! From being told "Happy Anniversary" by the hostess, our waiter and the manager to taking recommendations on what to order. From the crab and avocado appetizer to the best filet I've ever tasted...Steak 44 has set the bar high!   We were even comped a dessert that was decorated for our anniversary.   I highly recommend checking this hidden gem out! We will definitely be returning.

I must say that I was saddened after our last visit to CCG.  We had been there numerous times before and never had a bad experience.  And to clarify; our bad experience was strictly food related.  The staff was on point as they usually are! They are so polite and on point for as busy as they get.  Back to the food...we ordered an appetizer and drinks.  Less then a minute after receiving our app, our food came out!  The person who brought our food out was not our waitress and I advised them that we just got our app and were not ready for our meal.  Guess that's where I went wrong because the 2nd time our food came back out, the bread was soggy and covered in grease (we ordered the phillys), the cheese that was supposed to be on the sandwiches was on the side and the fries had gone cold.  I don't like to assume but think it's safe to say our food waited under a semi warm light until we were ready. It's really unfortunate because I love CCG but don't think we'll be eating next time!

I absolutely love the revamped look inside The Good Egg. It gives you that rustic farm / farmers market fresh feel! The food was delicious as always! My wife and I both had the Bacado omelette with a side of the dollar pancakes! The staff, food and experience was good as always and we will definitely be returning.

Worst Philly Cheesesteak I've ever had! Not sure if it's the seasoning on the beef or the beef but it has no flavor and very bland. Waste of $10! Won't be coming back.

Everyone has their own reason why they love their gym. I could go on for days about the equipment, cleanliness, affordability, hours, classes, etc. but what makes us adore Anytime Fitness Arrowhead is the owner! Natalee Sticht is more than a gym owner though. She not only makes herself available to her clients but she is always in house at the gym waiting to answer questions. Natalee is always putting on informational classes/workshops to help us live the best, most healthiest lifestyles! She is very thoughtful and very creative. Always thinking up new ways to inspire us!   She has also been a huge supporter praying for us with our infertility battle! Walking into see this just blew us away! Thank you, Natalee!

Even though this is only my first review at AMC Arrowhead; I have come here almost weekly since the remodel. They seriously have set a new standard in going to the movies from the plush, leather recliners to the full bar to the food and snack menu that has been updated! They make even the worst movies enjoyable when being watched here!

I would definitely recommend Noodles & Co! Their food is fresh and delicious, portions are huge and you won't let disappointed! This was our first time there and my wife and I both had the Penne Rosa.  It had a slight kick but wasn't too spicy (just enough for flavor). The staff is also incredibly friendly! We will be back!

This review could've been 5 stars but the service was bad.   First off, we wanted to try something new and exciting so we checked out the Rogue Tomato. The food was incredible! The Sonoran Quesadilla is a must try!    Everyone was polite upon arrival and when we left but our server forgot about is after the food was delivered. When he brought out the food and asked was there anything else, my pregnant wife asked for more water. He never came back with any, never came back to check on how the food was and I assumed his shift was over after not seeing him for 20-30 minutes. Had to stop another waiter just for a to go box and our check. When our waiter dropped the check off, he apologized and said he left been busy serving bigger parties. While I understand that, you can't forget about your other tables.  I'll definitely be back snd would recommend this place. Awesome concept, great decor and incredible food! Hopefully the service will be better though next time!
