I hate to fly.  I really do.  It is ironic b/c I am a travel agent but flying makes my belly upset, so I really don't love it.  With all the travel I do and flying from Indy...I never have a nonstop ANYWHERE...unless I'm going to Chicago and often, I am suprised we don't "stop off' in South Bend....  Anyway...Charlotte's airport is BY FAR the best airport I have ever flown through.  For one thing, they are great about keeping things on time unless a flight is delayed from somewhere else.  I know this is more the airline, but I have never been delayed here.  They have great food and coffee places, shopping options and plenty of walking room through terminals.  And, my favorite are the huge open windows and rocking chairs to relax in while you are waiting for your next flight.  It is the "homiest" airport ever. :)  It's updated, nice, clean and wonderful if there is such a thing!!  I highly recommend that if you have to have a layover, do your best to fly through Charlotte. :)

I am a very tough critic when it comes to EP hotels.  And, let's just say I would DEFINITELY recommend this hotel to a client if I had to.  The Hilton staff was awesome, helpful and extremely friendly. I was getting a tooth ache from the gal who checked us in who was upbeat and HAPPY to allow us an early check in which was at 8 AM!!! I have never in my whole life been checked into a hotel or resort at 8 AM, b/c that is basically giving a room away for free!  I was super surprised and pleased by this, so it was a great first impression.  If you want to shuttle somewhere within 2 miles of the hotel, they will take you for free.  The gentlemen who drove us was incredibly nice, giving us advice and drove us all over the downtown area like our own personal driver.  It was a great experience!  When something did go wrong (there was a situation/miscommunication regarding the shuttle pick up) they comped us a dessert and movie as an apology, which we didn't even ask for.  I was blown away again and again by the hotel and especially the staff.  Our room boasted a lovely view of the mountains and palm trees, a king bed, two flat screen TVs, an oversized living space and a large bathroom.  For $119/night it was a steal in my opinion.  We stayed two nights and I was sad to leave, to be honest.  I would definitely stay here again and truly appreciated the service and staff. Thanks Hilton!

Unimpressed.  This airport is carpeted which simply grosses me out.  In addition, there are not that many food options passed security.  I know we won't starve but there is nothing healthy and at 8 AM, very limited options for something more savory than breakfast.  The airport is also confusing.  There is no efficient way to navigate between major terminals.  To rent a car, you have to board a shuttle and ride for 20 minutes. It's obnoxious.    The USAir check in was also a cluster with three different sections offering three different services which made it MORE confusing than it needed to be to simply check in with luggage.  Annoying.  My patience is never on point at an airport but in this case, they need to take some notes from IND.  On the upside, Wi-Fi is free (which is rare).

I am a big fan of Mexican breakfast and we enjoyed an awesome experience at the Good Egg last weekend on our way to Pinnacle Peak. I am worried I am not reviewing the RIGHT one b/c I honestly don't remember which one we were at, but the point is, I enjoyed my breakfast here: The WILDCAT SCRAMBLE 3 eggs scrambled & served in a skillet with your choice of Egg-stra. Chorizo, corn tortilla strips, green chilies, grilled onion, black beans, melted cheeses, Veracruz sauce, sour cream & scallions. Served with salsa & flour tortillas on the side.  I loooooved this meal.  It was filling, over-caloried and served with coffee and fresh OJ.  Yuuuuummmmillllongdingdong.  And - outdoor dining.  YAY.  I love eating with the sun beating down on my skin.  Soooo lovely!  Phoenix you are spoiled.  Have I mentioned that lately?

I visited Pittsburgh a few weeks ago for the Indianapolis vs. Steelers game...the game rocked.  This bar, did not.  I am a pretty easy to please girl.  Give me drinks, give me bar food, give me fun.  This bar barely accomplished the drink part!  There was a large group of heavy drinkers with me.  Most of us were drinking normal, easy drinks including vodka tonics and Miller Lite.  Our server greeted us but then was long and lost only reappearing every 20 minutes or so, took FOREVER to take our order and eventually pissed us off so bad, we tipped her $2.00 on an over $200 bill.  As close as we were sitting to the door, we could have escaped without paying and gotten away with it and my drunky friends really wanted to.  Having been a server in the past, I did my best to tally up the bill and we left just enough to cover before bolting out the door.  Not only did she not bring us drinks quickly, she didn't bring the right mixed drinks the majority of the time.  Even after REASSURING her we would be a good table, leave a hefty tip and be big spenders, she avoided us like the plague.  Was it busy ...YES, but DO YOUR JOB.  Avoid your small, stingy tables who aren't ordering food or drinks and wait on the ones with gusto who have promised you big rewards for adequate service...or don't and get left with a $2.00 slap in the face.  Our food took over an hour to come out....we ordered sliders, mozzerella balls and BLT sandwiches.  I'm not sure what the hold up was with the dinner portion but needless to say, with empty drinks, my little crowd of 10 was getting pissy.  It is too bad, too b/c the food didn't suck but one could not PAY me to return to this little hell hole on Carson Street.  There are way too many other fun options and the service ALONE killed this place for me.  Miss Waitress knows who she is...and even though her excuses of being very busy and having tables in all areas were supposed to make us feel sorry for her, after awhile all she sounded like was the teacher from Peanuts...wah wah wah wah, STFU and DO YOUR JOB...I hope your boss reads this and does something about it, b/c I'm fairly sure that it is just a lack of interest in your work that made our experience SUCK so bad.  Never. Again.

I cannot explain how much I love downtown Las Vegas.  Not only is the child to adult ratio nearly 0-10,000 but the bars and casinos are SO much better than on the strip!  For beginner gamblers, I definitley think this is your place.  It is fantastic for asking questions, low minimums and helpful people.  It is ALL about gambling and a lot less about entertaining people...with the crap that infests the strip.   The whole feel of downtown is enveloped in "Old Vegas" and I love it...especially at the Nugget, where I could sit in a smoke free poker room for 14 hours and never get bored or feel unwelcome at a low limit Texas Hold 'Em table.  The dealers were polite and good - I won!  And, the patrons were awesome!!  The waitresses were quick and remembered my drink (vodka tonic with lime) and always said "thank you" for every tip.  I learned how to play craps and roulette here as well ...and it was an amazing experience.  The hotel has recently undergone a renovation and it was immaculate.  I highly recommend if you are looking to get away from 'kid-friendly' Vegas and want to eat/drink/gamble for nearly a third of the price, head down to Old Vegas where you can enjoy yourself and not necessarily come away from the experience broke!  I love me some Nugget...I can't wait to go back!

I'm not sure how to rate a casino, b/c ...well, if I lose, I have a bad taste in my mouth.  And, I lost here.  I only played poker but the experience wasn't that great. They have a few perks if you have to toss away losing pocket aces and you get to spin a wheel for some free stuff, but all in all, I didn't love it here.    First off, the hotel is FAR from where we were staying (Caesar's) and it was a hella long walk...It also was a bit more of a family-friendly hotel, so upon entering, I was overwhelmed by this factor.  I don't understand what the appeal is ...anyway...  I also am not sure how to rate an experience, b/c well, every experience is different depending on players and I thought the ones at my table were too serious, not at all fun and the dealer wasn't that brilliant either.  I like my dealers to have a sense of humor, be helpful and a bit complimentary...these guys were none.  It was just kind of a dark/quiet experience.  I was going to give it a three...but now I'm dropping it to a two.  It's not worth the trek out to no man's land Vegas to lose your ass with boring dealers and patrons.

Disappointed, Chelsea.  I did a foodie tour of Phoenix this past weekend and I had been given SO many recommendations for Chelsea's Kitchen so of course when I read about the free salted chocolate chip cookies, I threw my diet to the side and jumped on the chance to give it a try.  Unfortunately my overall experience was simply "meh".  BOOOOO!  I believe I got off on the wrong foot with our server, though I'm not sure why.  It was not busy when we arrived as it was a Monday at 5 PM.  We were seated immediately and I asked a waitress (VERY tall brunette with a bun and a bit of a snarky smile) if there were any drink specials.  She said there were not so I ordered off the regular drink menu, an overpriced oversweetened cucumber concoction that was DISGUSTING.  Someone else brought the drinks while yet ANOTHER waitress (shorter, more petite brunette gal) actually took our food order.    We tried all the higher recommendations on Yelp but honestly I was not impressed by anything we ate.  We decided on the short rib and ahi tuna tacos both with the Kale salad.  We also got the deviled eggs which were "OK".  I don't know if I am supposed to be impressed with normal eggs boiled and baconed up.  Anyway, the short ribs were good but needed more flavor and my ahi tuna was beyond bland. I was supremely disappointed that everything just didn't hit the mark.  But what really upset the whole dinner was the same girl who first offered us drinks and told us there were NO specials on beverages, offered the table RIGHT next to us the "happy hour" specials which included $5 house wine, half off beer list and well drink specials.  Endless options for the couple sitting next to us?!?!  What?!?!  I was furious.  I don't know why I got so upset but I felt completely jipped b/c I was sipping an awful drink, eating bland food AND basically being lied to.  I proceeded to inform our food waitress about this situation and honestly, I would not have been so upset had I not specifically asked her about special options for drinks.  I probably would have drank a lot more too and chosen something I wanted vs. feeling like my options were limited to the specialty drink list.  Our waitress was calm and polite, removing the drink charge but for $55 this food was not worth it and if they are going to pick and choose who they offer the specials to then I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  The place was packed though so it certainly is popular.  I have been wrong before so make your own call about going.    And the cookies - they were pretty good but nothing I would go out of my way again to eat.

I'm a Colts fan...I love them, have been since i was 7 but ultimately, I am a football fan....and this stadium was built for its die-hard fans.  I can totally appreciate that.  Not only are there a shitload of seats, but MOST of them are not nose bleeds and the ones that are (I'm sure they are FREEZING this time of year) look to still have decent views of the field and screens.  My hubby is a big Pittsburgh Steeler fan, as his cousin plays for the team...so we headed out for the Colts vs. Steelers game in early november.  I have only been in a couple of NFL stadiums in my lifetime (one of them being my beloved RCA Dome) and I have to say, I was BLOWN away by the arena.  It was UNBELIEVABLE.  The seats are painted BRIGHT Steelers yellow that blinds you when you walk in.  And, if you are there for the opposing team (like I was), you DEFINTIELY stand out, b/c MAN, their fans come out in hordes swarming in every section, ready to bare down on an outsider.  It was awesome!!  Speaking of fans, despite me boasting blue and our team rockin' it out that day, they were REALLY cool to me.  I stood out like a sore thumb, being only one of maybe four Colts fans in my section so I was pretty exposed!  The guys sitting next to me gave me a hard time, insisted I swing their Terrible Towel and in general, were a lot of fun. :) I'm sure that not everyone was as nice, but I had great neighbors.  My seats were fantastic, in the lower section in the corner of the endzone.  I could see all the action!! It was great and I really enjoyed it.  It was REALLY cold but all in all, outside of seeing the Colts beat NE in the 2007 AFC Championship, this was by far the best NFL football experience I have ever had!  It was FANFREAKINTASTIC!!  If you ever have a chance to visit Heinz Field, TAKE advantage.  It was easily accessible, in a great location downtown, security was a breeze, fans rocked it out and the stadium is AWESOME!!

My hubby and I celebrated my 27th birthday in what I considered "style".  I'm a bit high maintenance at times when it comes to hotels and if we were going to do Vegas, I wanted to do it on the strip, in a perfect location in an upscale hotel.  We took a cab from the airport and headed down the strip to the hotel...little did I know it took up like four city blocks! I was THRILLED.  I've always had a thing for Greece and Italy, so this hotel seemed fitting.  I was in awe ...considering this was my first trip! :)   Upon arriving, I took photos of everything from the lobby to the casino...I thought it was gorgeous...was it crowded, yes!  Was it overdramatic, of course! Was it Vegas?  DEFINITELY!   We pulled the "$20 Trick" by placing a $20 under our CC (thanks Sarah G.!!) and telling her about my birthday.  She upgraded us from a standard room to a junior suite with a Jacuzzi.  It had ZERO view, but I loooove Jacuzzi bathtubs, so the view was pointless. :) I was thrilled!!  What I was not perfectly thrilled with was the kids...they were freakin' EVERYWHERE...and there is a Pussy Cats Doll bar in the middle of the hotel that boasts girls dancing in cages OUTSIDE the door, so...hope your 5 year old enjoyed that show!  The casino was a bit out of our price range, so we opted to gamble in other hotels, but I really loved our room, the service was good.  There were tons of nightclub options all within walking distance INSIDE the hotel (which I thought was great) and plenty of entertainment without stepping foot into the 100 degree weather!    I won't stay here again, only b/c it was SO expensive and we didn't really spend enough time in our room to justify it, but it was a great experience and I would recommend it if you don't mind shelling out the dough but be sure, you LOVE big hotels b/c you can get lost up in this joint!

Awwww, PHX folks, you are so spoiled. Endless outdoor dining options, beautiful landscapes, incredible views AND affordable public transport?!?!  So jealous.  Whenever I travel outside of Indy, I ask myself "Why do I not live here?"  And Phoenix, that is how I feel about you.    For $4 you can ride all day unlimited and easily access so much of the town via the Light Rail - even for a tourist, this is a very easy way to navigate the city and see a lot with little time. It runs every 12 minutes throughout the business week and every 20 on the weekend.    I have a feeling that although some locals don't LOVE it, there is something to be said for a growing economy in PHX popping up around the rail.  So many cool ways to go downtown, eat and drink in the city.  It's reasonably safe as I never felt awkward or out of place, though it did get crowded on First Friday.  We were still able to squeeze in with the locals!    The daytime ride included being joined by local students which were amazingly well behaved, despite the lack of adults around (we don't count ourselves).  For a mere $4 ride all day!  I love it.  I am jealous - that is all.

Definitely A-OK and actually even better than that.  We got a great price plus my travel agent discount, so really a big steal!  They gave us a new car and we had ZERO wait.  There was no one in front of us or behind us on either pick up or delivery. The process was smooth and easy.  I honestly don't know what all the whining is about with regard to some of these reviews.  It's an affordable car rental option with good customer service, which I personally experienced on the phone and in person with several representatives of the company.  I overall really appreciated my experience and would use them again.  Our car had no issues, had a nice sunroof and other than the additional $40 for an additional driver, I thought we got a great deal of $160 for five days WITH gas for a mid-size cross over NEW vehicle.  I really hate that bus ride from the airport though it runs regularly and is not difficult to find so that's a plus.

Holy good tacos, Batman.  I loooove Mexican street tacos. I want to bathe in guacamole and dip myself in hot sauce.  OK, maybe not quite that extreme, but I really enjoyed my experience here.  First I am not from PHX and I am so jealous that you all get to eat outside in April.  My town is cold and frigid so it was such a treat to have our first meal in this town outdoors at a picnic table with a Dos Equis.  I enjoyed the carne asada and pork tacos.  The steak was my favorite, tender and fabulously cooked.  I loved the corn tortillas.  The guac was wonderful and a tasty add on that everyone must try!  The food came out fast and was inexpensive.  This is a great place to enjoy some friendly chatter over fabulously delicious food.

The Biltmore is an incredible resort and even nicer than many other properties I have seen in my 7 years of travel experience through the Caribbean, Mexico and even Hawaii.  This resort is large, with beautiful impressive landscaping, fabulous Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, multiple pools, and an amazing golf course.    I opted for the Octallia rooms, which are in a newer section with upgraded in room amenities along with access to the Concierge area where you can get free drinks, snacks, breakfast and access to someone to assist with dinner reservations, business center, etc.  Our room was spacious and luxurious.  I realllllly liked our room. I am big into having a comfortable place to sleep, cuddle with my honey and nap when the weather turns sour. I don't understand people who don't like nice rooms, b/c you really do spend a lot of time in there.  I looooved the bathroom which had a deep oversized tub (my fave) and I appreciated the small touches like the sea salt and nice bath products.    The pools are busy if you choose one of the two main pool options, but the staff around them was easily accessible, friendly and honest.  We had no issues and the day we rented the cabana at the pool ($150 for partial sun/$200 for all day sun) we received outstanding service.  The cabana had a nice little room, TV and it's own bathroom along with an outdoor table and two lounge chairs.  If you prefer to have a pool to yourself, the Octallia area is deserted as well as a couple of other smaller pools but they ALSO do not have poolside service.  Chairs by the pools are first come, first serve and on the weekends, it did appear to be difficult to score a good chair so get down there early.  This resort is also incredibly family friendly.  We were there at the tail-end of spring break which was obvious as there were tons of families in the pool and running around the property.  This didn't bother us at all but I was a little surprised.  The main pool did offer a slide but it wasn't operating.  Anyway - the point is, a great luxury family friendly option for those with kiddos!  The spa was incredible.  We got 80 minute Dream Maker massages and it was AWESOME (but expensive).  I felt pampered and relaxed after.  Well worth it but oh so pricey.  The reason I am not going to give this place 5 stars is b/c everything is CRAZY expensive.  I mean, everything is literally double what it would be anywhere else and room service carried a $4 delivery charge along with a 23% surcharge tax on top of the already crazy 14% "tourism" tax which we paid at every hotel in the city. . RIDICULOUS.  So please keep in mind, everything is on the pricier side. This is not a "budget" friendly place.   But it is a luxury resort in a fabulous location with beautiful areas to dine outdoors and enjoy a drink with the ones you love.  If you are comfortable with the price, upgrade to the Octallia rooms - it's all in the details.

We just happened upon First Friday in Phoenix last week as we had plans to meet at 8 PM with a wedding party after their rehearsal.  I loved it!  I was dying for some "local" eclectic shopping options and this little whim of a decision allowed me to score two adorable tops - one at the Happy Hippy and a Positive Thinking T-Shirt.  What a wonderful option for exploring and enjoying downtown Phoenix the first weekend of the month! I know that Indy has this too so I may have to check it out in my hometown but if you are in the area, don't miss this group of artists, musicians and local business owners touting their wares for you to enjoy.  I would have spent hours longer here but my hubby was dying of beer thirst.  In any case, I love the finds I found and have already been wearing them a ton!  Thanks PHX for a great first impression!

We loved it here.  It's VERY busy on First Friday - just an FYI.  It was a minimum 30 minute wait at prime dining time and very hot inside the restaurant.  Outside of that, the staff was friendly though a bit "flaky".  I assume it's b/c they were very busy.  The tap options were endless and as others have mentioned, rotate as they go throughout the evening.  It's a great way to keep you coming back for more!  They have a beautiful patio with a lot more dining tables and that is where we got to sit.  I love eating outside in perfect AZ weather!  We got the veggie flatbread which was DEEEEELISH and can I just say ...Oh. Em. Gee with regard to the wings.  They were roasted to perfection and served with three sauces on the side, which was ingenious! I really enjoyed that touch so I could mix and match the sauce.  I am still drooling over the amazingness that was the wings!  Get them.  The beer options were also wonderful and the price point is average.  I would have spent more money here but I was jet-lagged and had to get back to the hotel before I passed out at my table after my two beers.  Light weight here.
