Jeremy and his team were amazing with both a refinance and new loan.  They are thorough, extremely diligent, and honest with the entire process. I feel good about recommending Jeremy and his team,

Jeremy and the community tire team are very helpful and honest.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for quality service at good pricing.  We have used them for new tires, tune ups, and diagnosing our company vehicles.

Before I talk about the food, let me say their menu is so confusing and they don't list half of the items they put on their wraps or sandwiches. For example, when I went in I did not see any menus besides the board behind the counter. I ordered a southwest wrap which had no description of anything that was in it. When I got it it was completely smothered in sauce.  This place is disguised as a healthy alternative but the truth is they aren't healthy at all. Their smoothies don't announce they are juice based which adds tons of sugar and the green smoothie I ordered tasted like apple juice.  I would never go here again. If this  establishment made some changes lt could be decent

This is the 5th or 6th time I have had work done with Lovetts and each time I have had a great experience so I finally decided it was long overdue to give a review I have brought both work and personal Vehicles to Lovetts  after collisions and minor dents issue (mirrors, dents , etc) Lovetts is usually half the price of dealership rates and the quality is as good or better.  They are centrally located and have quick turn around time. They will also shuttle you home or to your office if you need.

I took my truck back to Lovetts after some minor damage.  I can't say enough about my experience with Lovetts.  They are extremely honest and provide quality work at a fair price.  On top of that, they are Nice and very accommodating providing me ride to and from my office while y truck was worked on. If you need any body work you need to give them a call.

Ingos has a great atmosphere and food is great.  They use grass fed meat for all burgers and there are incredibly important reasons why grass fed is so much better. Both nutritionally and in treatment of animals.  All the other items on the menu are great as well, they have great beers, apps and other menu items besides burgers. The only recommendation I would offer the restaurant has to do with their "to go" burgers.  I'm not sure if it has to do with the bun and/or the way you request the burger to be cooked but only when I order to go I almost always get a soggy bun which I of course do not like. Eating at the restaurant this never happens.  Great place
