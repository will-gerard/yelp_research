This is THE neigborhood spot!  We love, love, love everything about it.  It's been open a year or so, and we already have those cozy warm feelings like it's our second home.  The cocktails, the fish sandwich, the peanut butter ice cream at Churn -- heaven everytime.  The staff is beautiful, yet unpretentious...a delightful combo!  As a side bonus, I stopped by last week and asked the manager if they might be interested in making a donation to our school's fundraiser.  I'm sure they get a million requests, and I was happy to get a call back 48 hours later that the gift was ready.  A great restaurant that also gives back to the community.  Bonus points!  Go, go, and go again.  If you live within a few miles, hop on a bike and cruise down.  Makes the peanut butter ice cream not so sinful. :)

Sad, but true -- another half-hearted attempt to create a local neighborhood bar falls short.   The reviews on here already say it all, so here are my Cliff notes.  Don't name your place something catchy, only to have no meaning behind it.  We asked our server, and her answer was, "We don't know..." Make it up at this point, to avoid the buzzkill when the answer falls short.  How about, "So-So" instead?  Salads follow the motto, "Quality over quantity." The few little grapes hidden in the bottom didn't justify a $12 salad with no taste and bland dressing.  I wanted to like, actually -- LOVE this place, and I was sad with the experience. The prices are high, and services is sub-par, and they might just get away with it for a year or so.  I am the biggest supporter of local biz you will ever know, so it bums me out to write this.  Maybe with some tweaks, OHSO can turn it around.
