I've been to plenty of chiropractors to know Dr Nemanic IS THE VERY BEST OUT THERE. His wealth of knowledge and his ability to find and problem and fix it is astounding! Truly he is the real deal. I am a 53 young women super healthy fit who has spent a lot if time and money in the pursuit of health. He is THE BEST. I'm heading back to Utah for the summer and if I have a situation that I need a chiropractor I will be flying back to see him.

What can I say, I heard it was a great place for steaks, but my 23 year old son, myself and my parents give it a 8/10. The other restaurant being a 10/10. So you would like to know what the other restaurant is, okay it's Durant's, outstanding service, food for the most discerning palate.   The ambiance at Capital Grille was stately and becoming of a steak restaurant. For the price I was expecting amazing. I was sadly disappointed. You can expect to pay $80-$100 person for soup/salad, entree, side dishes, no liquor, tax, and tip.   Our waitress was Janet, she was very pleasant. Unfortunately, her helpers didn't do their joy very well. We seemed to have to wait forever to have dirty dishes removed , water glasses refilled, or our order taken for desert. It has the feel of a chain restaurant, good but not great. We were new to Capital Grille. We went for my Mother's birthday. Not sure I'll be returning anytime soon.

Thanks to all the yelpers a friend and I had brunch here on a Sunday, when I realized it was in a strip mall I was a little surprised, but once I found the Restuarant it had all the ambiance of a 5 star Restuarant. So welcoming, beautiful, opened to the outside, ski lights, etc. who ever designed this place knew what they were doing. Neither of us were very hungry so we opted to split a crab and egg Benedict. I asked for the muffin to be replaced with spinach. It came with beautiful fingerling potatoes and was simply Devine.  The service, staff, entree, filtered watered, we were even asked if we wanted lemons. It was absolutely delightful. The Chef came out and thanked a party of 8 for coming out every Sunday. It has such a warm, and cheerful environment.
