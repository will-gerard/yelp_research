(2.75 stars)  Charlotte-Douglas may be my favorite large airport in the Eastern US.  The arrangement of terminals is easy to maneuver, while the terminals themselves are well-lit and airy.  There are many dining and drinking options, and cool rocking chairs.  The gate waiting areas are too small, but there are better areas to wait.  The car rental experience is on-site and efficient.  TSA Security at Charlotte-Douglas seems to be able to expand during busy periods, and hasn't caused me any issues in dozens of flights.  While not close to downtown, getting to the airport (or from airport to city) has always been smooth.  The information booth folks are actually helpful; quite a change if you're arriving from Miami or NY/JFK.  A very late arriving flight once caused me to miss a connection and on that particular night finding a nearby motel was pretty easy.

The Old Spaghetti Factory is a fun chain restaurant where both families and larger, alcohol-fueled gatherings are at home.  I come from an area where "red Italian" menu items are commonplace, and mediocrity is the norm.  From this perspective, the cooking here is comforting and old-school; a notch above the ordinary, but nothing to get excited about.  Fortunately, portions are very generous, prices are quite reasonable and The Old Spaghetti Factory scores on that basis.  The lasagna was loaded with meat and just enough ricotta to balance.  Not enough mozzarella was buried under a thick coat of ho-hum tomato sauce.  Several other cheeses were (literally) throw-in's, the dish would improve with their removal or replacement with adequate quantities of garlic, basil, oregeno and/or onion.  Seasoning, in general, appears to be oriented toward their pre-school and geriatric patrons.  My coworker had the crab raviolli; it looked delicious, but a bit light on crab.  She did enjoy it.  While David was a capable and friendly waiter, the kitchen let him (and us) down.  Our appetizers and entrees were brought to the table within a minute of each other; completely unacceptable, and cause for the loss of one star.

(1.75 stars) Continental uses Terminal 2 of PHX, which is smaller, older and a bit more worn than Terminals 3 or 4.  The dining spots are fewer, but TSA Security was a breeze on late afternoon Thursday; they were waiting for me.  Security here claims to not have all of the newest equipment, and as a result, they screen very carefully.  It has been at least two years since I've been asked to have the quart-sized ziplock bag of liquids removed from my carry-on bag.  Waiting areas are large and not well-lit.  Travel between terminals requires a shuttle bus, and they're somewhat slow.  This is one of the worst places to have connecting flights with mismatched airlines as the newer terminals are huge, and the older ones are poorly connected.  Car rental requires a shuttle bus to a central facility; allow at least 15 minutes.  All told, PHX is neither bad nor impressive.

(1.50 stars)  When I'm about to board a 5 hour flight, I stuff a sandwich and soda bottle into my messenger bag for later consumption.  The expectation is about as basic as I'm ever going to have regarding food.  Paradise Bakery, which apparently is a very well-regarded local chain, really needs to assess how to translate their successes into an airport setting.  Although she appeared to be very bored, the young lady at the counter was friendly-- no attitude problem.  I wanted mayo instead of their "Paradise Sauce," and she delivered here, as well.  The sandwich was reasonably thick with meat, greens and tomatoes.  Bread, which was understood to be their strong suit, was over-sized and a bit stale; perhaps I waited too long to eat it.  There were no bottles of unsugared soda, but water was fine.  Where did things go wrong?  First, there wasn't enough paper used to wrap the sandwich and keep it intact; how expensive would 3" of additional paper on a $7.50 sandwich have been?  Next, no napkins were packed; this should be an automatic at airport carryout.  Third, for some reason, a chocolate chip cookie was thrown into the bag.  For reasons which will be clear in a moment, it was very broken (but very tasty) when I found it.  Finally, although I specifically asked for a cheap plastic bag, I was given a froufrou paper mini shopping bag with an "adorable" paper handle.  I don't need to impress my fellow passengers with my good taste in shopping bags, I needed something which will neatly compress to be stowed.  If you have ever tried to reassemble a sandwich while in the middle seat of an airplane, you get the picture.  The end-product was adequate, with mayo and tomato covered hands as an added bonus.  Once again life teaches me that lowering your standards just a little ultimately means that reasonable expectations become unrealistic.

Not without its inconsistencies, the Scottsdale Hilton Resort is an elegant and beautifully appointed hotel in a location convenient to both Old Town and the local highways.    The front desk and concierge service are absolutely top-notch, customer-centric and on their game.  The little details are tended to; good coffee and flavored waters in the main lobby, outstanding poolside bar service, thick cotton towels and robes and clean public areas among them.  In fact, so much attention is given to hosing-down the outdoor concrete that you would never suspect that the area has a water shortage.  Rooms were right-sized, neither spacious, nor cramped, and attractively furnished.  Water pressure was good on the first floor, but temperatures were extremely inconsistent and variable.  Beds appeared to be a bit old and not as comfortable as in most Hilton properties.  The available television stations were at least a decade behind current tastes, but high-end LG flat screens were appreciated.  WiFi bandwidth was outstanding, and didn't require constantly repeating a log-in process.  The Scottsdale Hilton Resort has two restaurants, an independent Fleming's (a top-tier chain steakhouse) and their own Blue Fire.  While I found the food at the Blue Fire to be adequate, I believe that the other members of my family will disagree.  Service is amateurish and slow, while prices are high.  No worries, however, as there are dozens of places to eat within an easy walking radius.  We checked-in as a family of four, yet received only three sets of towels.  The front desk was apologetic, and promised that additional towels would be delivered shortly.  Three hours later we called again and the extra towels arrived within five minutes.  Yet for each of the two remaining days of our stay housekeeping brought only three sets.  It is an attention to details like this which separate "very good" from "great" motels.  There is plenty of free parking, but the campus is very large and long walks may be necessary if you don't park near the closest entry point to your room.  Our room had a locked refrigerator, which I'll assume to be a cash bar feature, yet we were never offered the opportunity to obtain a key.  We enjoyed our stay at Scottsdale Hilton Resort, and at $119/night found an incredible irony in the fact that the least expensive of the three motels on our cross-Arizona vacation was clearly the best.

Whenever the situation warrants, I'll usually ask a business acquaintance from the Pittsburgh area whether they have been to "The O" lately.  Usually I get a smile and a conversation ice-breaker.  It's been years since I've been here, but by all indications, little changes.  In Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood, the heart of the college district, "The O" represents all of the angst and energy, the culinary hedonism and "WTF" attitude of my undergraduate years (in Cleveland).  Hot dogs are their namesake, and they're alright; the burgers and steak sandwiches are okay.  What everybody remembers about "The O" must be seen to be believed.  An order of fries or onion rings is huge beyond anticipation.  I would suspect that a few orders of fries from "The O" would have carried Napoleon's troops across Russia in the middle of winter.  Quantity aside, they're good.  You won't find the crisp, double-fried french fries or duck fat and truffle froufrou here; this is a roll-up-the-sleeves blue collar place.  I doubt that it is the cleanest place I've ever eaten in, but this isn't a place for whining and complaining, calorie-counting or sustaining a healthy diet.  It's cash-only, and there's no parking for blocks around, but that would be whining and complaining.  Order, sit down and gorge; eating can be this simple!

Local dining icons deserve their own criteria for recognition.  That said, adding sliced tomato, coleslaw and a pile of fries to a deli sandwich defines the Primanti as a Pittsburgh-area institution.  Their cheesesteaks will never threaten the best of Philly's, nor will their pastrami or corned beef be mistaken for New York deli; this only serves to make the Primanti style unique.  I find their meats to be generally good, and reasonably generous.  Tomato on a corned beef sandwich can only be regarded as an acquired taste.  Personally, I'm not a fan of loading a sandwich with fries, but again, this is a matter of preference.  The assembled work is a massive sandwich which invites a machismo-driven, face-first dive into its mismatched imperfection.  After the second or third surfacing-for-air, the conclusion I've always had was of an enjoyable adventure.  Prices are downright cheap.

Although previously unknown to me, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is a part of a large, multistate chain.  Their standards of food and service easily identify this realization, in spite of the fact that it is stated on their menu.  Not to be misunderstood, the turkey club sandwich that I ordered wasn't bad, and the requisite flavors were all there.  Sloppy assembly and plating, however, illustrated the plight of a kitchen slammed at lunchtime and simply trying to move to the next order.  To say that there was no "love" put into this sandwich would be an understatement.  Our server (I believe that his name was Johnny) was apologetic- even funny- about how backed-up the kitchen was.  Yes, service was slower-than-slow, but a personable and attentive server made the extended wait somewhat bearable.  Their desserts looked great, and I'm not a dessert eater.  Unfortunately, we wouldn't have had the rest of the afternoon to wait for them.  So yet another restaurant chain is added to the list of those that I will try to avoid in my frequent business travel.

Several years ago, when business travel to Houston was regular, I became a big fan of the Pappas family restaurants-- Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen in particular.  As we drove north from Phoenix airport to Sedona I noticed a sign for Pappadeaux, and knew that this would be a lunch stop when the final portion of our vacation brought us back to Phoenix.  The restaurant is large, attractively appointed and comfortable, with an encyclopedic menu of fish and seafood offerings.  Although best known for their Cajun preparations, there are abundant choices for everyone who enjoys well-prepared fish and seafood.  Our server, Nicholaus, effortlessly navigated a crowded lunchtime dining room with our order.  Although a bit distant, he was a consummate professional.  Brought first to the table was a large platter of crispy fried alligator nuggets, served with a full-bodied spicy sauce.  I ordered a platter of fried oysters, one of my favorites, while my family selected po boy sandwiches of shrimp or alligator.  We each had a cup of their Andouille, Crab, and Shrimp Gumbo.  The sandwiches were bountiful, and from what I was told, absolutely delicious.  The same could be said for the fried oysters.  A tartar sauce whose consistency was a bit less obvious as a packaged commercial product is all that separated this lunch from greatness.  The seafood was all fried just to the point of presenting a crispy coating surrounding tender, moist and flavorful protein.  Hardly an inexpensive lunch, Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen is in that class of restaurant that I would seek out wherever they operate.

An adequate downtown motel.  Access and proximity are both good.  The location appeared to be clean and well-kept.  However, I'm now reading that they allow pets in guest's rooms, making it no more than a fancy kennel!  Unless they spray for fleas daily  (they don't), I'm not feeling good about this.  Parking is atrocious and the Raddison parking garage (a half-block away) must be used.  Service at the front desk was eager to help, but only Briana seemed to be able to operate their computer system at check-in.  There is only a $9 breakfast buffet here, but plenty of nearby places to eat.  Elevators are fast in this eight (ten??) floor motel.  Both water pressure and hot water were extremely good on the 3rd floor, sometimes it was impossible to get COLD water.  My coworker on the 4th floor had the same observation.  Their WiFi (free) never failed, but was very slow (below dial-up speeds).  My coworker wisely travels with a CAT5 LAN cable; I'll do the same next time.  The heating/cooling system does not appear to be aligned with the wall thermostat; room temperatures were never right.  Although the big screen televisions in each room are low-grade, channel selection is extremely good.  Our business rate was $139.99 ($158.57 with taxes), and that is reasonable for this motel.  I would come back for a few days at a time when business dictates, but this motel wouldn't be my first choice for a week-long stay.

Being familiar with the 90's tiki bar trend of tired, low-grade pseudo-Polynesian food, coupled with overpowered rum drinks, I approached the family's suggestion to try Hula's with some hesitation.  Much to my surprise, Hula's is quite different than the prior-century icon.  In a warm and inviting Old Town storefront, Hula's dim lighting, ample space and large central bar immediately brought to mind a comfortable dining and drinking environment.  Jazmine, our waitress, was patient, quite informative and quick to deliver our order.  We ordered a shared portion of the whitefish cerviche appetizer, and it was good.  The marinating of the fish in lime juice appeared to have been rushed, as neither fully tenderized fish nor a fully developed flavor profile were the result.  Next, we each ordered entrees and generously sampled from each plate.  The macadamia-crusted ahi, served medium rare, was very good.  A large cut of quality ahi in a nicely seasoned crust preserved the subtle balance of flavors between the two.  The luau-style pulled pork was tasty, if a bit sweet for my tastes.  Laced with a small dice of pineapple and pineapple juice, it remained satisfying none the less.  A scoop of jasmine rice helped to balance the flavors.  The star of the evening, however, was our older son's jerk pork.  Shredded, with a pleasant heat and light curry flavor, the dish was identifiable from its Caribbean origins, yet uniquely Hawaiian.  Portions are very large, and quite fortunately, the food was delicious enough to make this "a good thing."  Hula's Modern Tiki is a clever concept which, as the crowded dining room will attest, serves very good food.  Dinner for the four of us, pre-tip, was $75.50, making Hula's an outstanding value as well.

Driving south from the Grand Canyon on a Sunday morning, we were late for lunchtime and hungry.  Tucked away in a small strip mall was this location of Tottie's, and what a "find" it was.  The décor at Tottie's is pleasantly understated and quite attractive.  Table placement and noise levels don't detract from the dining experience.  With an emphasis upon the cuisines of Thailand and Vietnam, the menu is geographically varied and large.  Yet, contrary to the current trend of Pan-Asian bistro restaurants, portion sizes are ample.  The food is satisfying, generally authentic and aesthetically plated.  As a guide, the kitchen uses an Asian standard of spiciness; "moderate" heat will pack a punch, albeit one which we found to be agreeable.  Lunch began with a shared appetizer of Vietnamese-styled rice paper summer rolls.  In comparison to others that I've eaten, these were uncommonly thick, and a bit difficult to eat out-of-hand.  Shrimp, shredded pork and mint were apparent, but an overenthusiastic use of vegetables muted their flavors.  The accompanying peanut sauce was successful in balancing the flavors, but was a bit under-seasoned in its own right.  An entrée of red Panang beef curry was true-to-form in its Thai seasoning.  Accents of lemongrass and galangal, two aromatics often omitted from corner-cutting preparations, were apparent.  If a bit heavy in its liquid portion, the dish was otherwise spot-on.  The salmon filet in a basil and ginger sauce was both generous and quite tasty.  Very well balanced in its seasoning, yet not overpowering the taste of the fresh fish, this dish was an unconditioned success.  Shrimp Pad Thai rounded out our shared lunch entrees.  Ample in portion, a vermicelli noodle was used.  Pad Thai is best judged by how effectively the kitchen balances the key flavors of sweet, spicy, salty and sour, and lesser substitutions for tamarind sourness is usually where the preparation suffers.  In this case, however, slight demerits go to an inadequate representation of the sweet component-- perhaps the easiest area to master.  Although a bit unbalanced, the shrimp Pad Thai was still very good.  Our server, Rain, was enthusiastic, pleasant and prompt.  Before adding a generous tip for her services the tab for this enjoyable lunchtime feast for 4 totaled under $55; an excellent value for the dining experience received.

Prior expectations, even lofty ones, couldn't completely anticipate the Musical Instrument Museum experience.  This is an absolutely remarkable example of museum curating; interesting at every turn, relevant and just flat-out fun.  The Musical Instrument Museum is a worthy affiliate of the Smithsonian Museum system.  The first floor presents a wide-ranging survey of curious, as well as familiar, instruments.  Complimentary headsets are provided, complete with proximity sensors which let you hear each instrument in use as you view accompanying displays and video tracks.  It is, however, on the second floor where the world of musical instruments becomes a captivating journey through the countries and cultures of the world.  The presentation is one of remarkable depth, often providing separate display areas for religious, popular and cultural variations.    As we walked through the area where Burmese instruments and cultural artifacts were displayed, I was captivated by a mother's narrative to her young children of the music and folklore of their predecessors.  The mother's descriptions, and her children's reaction to their discovery of their cultural heritage, were truly touching.  I wasn't consciously trying to overhear her discussion, but found myself unable to wander beyond earshot.  Also on the second floor is a large and well-guided room where hands-on exploration of many instruments is invited.  Another area offered displays of many notable (and several lesser known) musicians.  Only minor demerits for the museum's undue favoritism toward its corporate sponsors (yes, Gibson also made some impressive guitars), and for a bit of inaccurate blending of cultures which happen to co-exist within geographic borders.  In context, these are minor complaints, as the Musical Instrument Museum is a magical place, and worth every penny of the $18 ticket price.

First, a disclaimer.  I haven't dined at Le Beaver Club in many years.  I had heard that the grandeur and glory which was Le Beaver Club had been dismantled in the '80's, but restored in recent years.  The restaurant holds far too significant a place in my personal progression of understanding and appreciating a fine dining experience to go without a review.  Now that things are again right, I'll write my piece.  Having just graduated high school, Montreal was where I most wanted to visit for a few days of get away.  The "fancy" dinner for this trip was Le Beaver Club.  An evening which began with some griping about getting dressed up for dinner, ended with my first appreciation of how a truly extraordinary meal had the power to excite my senses, to transport them to places I had never known to exist.  The elegance was apparent in everything which caught my eye, and yet remained approachable to this eighteen year old on his best behavior.  The differences between "eating" and "dining" were suddenly neither semantic nor subtle.  I can't honestly recall what I had for dinner that evening, only that it was an important cog in my first true dining experience.  Le Beaver Club was revisited several years later, while on our honeymoon, with the recollection that what was great on the first visit was even better on the second.  A fresh visit will be needed to assess this gem of a restaurant among my adult dining experiences, thus a star is withheld-- for the moment.

My airport routine before an extended flight includes grabbing a pre-made sandwich for the flight.  Completely unimpressed by the contribution of Paradise Bakery to this ritual a few years back, we tried The Coffee Bean.  Service was pleasant and with a smile, and sandwich prices were reasonable.  Perhaps I should have second-guessed the reasonable sandwich prices.  Selected was a chicken salad sandwich on what appeared to be a "wonder bread" type product.  While all white meat, the chicken in the salad was canned and unseasoned.  If someone had mislabeled the sandwich as tuna salad, a taste would not have divulged the error.    Pressed against its plastic wrapper there appeared to be a generous quantity of whatever this actually was, an illusion which vanished when the sandwich was unwrapped.  A good deal of the bread surface was dry and without anything but somewhat stale "wonder bread."  Those seated in the waiting area for our flight were commenting on how good the coffee was.  Unfortunately, the talents of The Coffee Bean don't seem to extend to something as simple as making a credible sandwich.

As the principal dining spot within the Scottsdale Hilton Resort, The Bluefire Grille really doesn't try very hard to elevate above the level of "expensive and mediocre."  Perhaps they believe that Hilton guests are a captive audience, a serious miscalculation with so many good restaurants within walking distance.  Service, even with a near-empty dining room, is unbearably slow, while at the same time presenting themselves as being under enormous pressure.  Of the 6 breakfast items ordered by the four of us, one was incorrect (not even close) and a second was completely overlooked.  What was brought to our table was prepared without passion, and struggled to reach the level of "eatable."    Yet, the breakfast problems paled in comparison to the dinner service.  As the only diners in the restaurant, being seated should not have taken anywhere as long as it did.  Once seated, the "10 count" prawn appetizer (i.e.- shrimp of approximately 2 oz. each) came to the table as shrimp of less than half that size, clumsily wrapped in eggroll wrappers and fried.  Aside from the fact that 3 different wrapping techniques were employed, this misrepresentation is clearly fraudulent.  My crab salad entrée wasn't bad, but family members who chose the duck and apple salad were considerably less positive in their assessments.  The Bluefire Grille presents itself as an eatery blessed by a good location, but with no serious intention of remaining in business.  Regrettably, and IMRHO, The Bluefire Grille thoroughly denigrates the guest experience of the Scottsdale Hilton Resort.

(4.50 stars)  For the final dinner of our Arizona vacation we only had to venture across the street from our motel, the Scottsdale Hilton Resort.  I had enjoyed dinner at a Paul Martin's location in the Los Angeles area two years ago, and was anxious to dine here.  The physical layout of the Scottsdale property was sleek and modern, with heavy emphasis upon dimmed lighting, chrome and glass-- not at all unlike the LA location.  Michelle P. was our server on Tuesday, and she was personable, pleasant, knowledgeable and reasonably prompt-- a very good job.  We skipped the appetizers, soups and salads and went right for our entrees.  Our sons and I each ordered a different steak (skirt, hanger and New York strip), while my wife chose the grilled salmon.  Each was cooked to the requested temperature, tender, nicely seasoned and attractively plated.  A sautéed "heirloom" spinach accompanied my steak, as it had my salmon two years ago.  Then, as now, the particular variety was properly seasoned, but otherwise flavorless.  Unlike my prior encounter, the tough lower stems had been trimmed; tender and tasty, but not memorable.  The boys each enjoyed their steaks, and my wife, the salmon.  The four of us broke from our normal practice and ordered desserts; three for the table.  Chosen were the homemade ice cream sampler, banana cream pie and the chocolate layer cake.  Each selection was superb; neither overly sweet, nor lacking in comfort food value.  An excellent meal!
