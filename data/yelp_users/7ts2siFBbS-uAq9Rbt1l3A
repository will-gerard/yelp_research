Totally fun place. Went with a meet up group. The crowd was easy going and obviously lots of local regulars.

This place is creeping me out. I was given a gift certificate for mani pedi. It's cold no-one is here.  Lots of empty stations. Just me and Ms frieda.   Its just weird.  I walked out and didn't finish the pedi.

Had a salad to go and you would think they would include utensils.  Nope!  I called in the manager and his response was we assume that people don't need utensils. They're available if you ask.  Seriously not a good customer service response.

I can only review Keith for integrity and I give him 5 stars.  He was on a job and accidentally bumped my car.  He left a note and made sure I was taken care of.  I believe the way a person does one thing is how they do everything!

I would NOT recommend using this service.  They say they are licensed and bonded however upon a theft of a large amount of money from my home, they denied any responsibility.  Shame on me for paying them with cash and leaving my purse out for them to see it while they packed things up. Shame on their owner for responded with.. 'we've turned it over to our attorneys".  I've had zero follow up from them.

I made the mistake of leaving my wallet out after paying in cash. Most expensive cleaning I've ever had. $800. Owner said and true I can't prove the loss so he did nothing. Unbelievable.
