Getting a cracked windshield is never fun! Especially when it happens twice in 1 week! My cracks were beyond repair so I needed a new windshield. I called American Glass and everyone there was so nice and helpful.....stating with the receptionist, to the service advisor and the technician who came to my house and did the job. You can't find a better company in my opinion!

Horrible service! I took my husbands shoes in to repair and I was horrified by the service. First, they wanted me to pay for the entire bill before they provided the service which I find to be ridiculous! I asked why and she kept saying "Store Policy".  I'm not a cheap person and have no problem spending money but when I'm asked to pay for a service that hasn't been provided yet coupled with her being rude then I have a problem with that. My advice to this business is to learn how to treat customers better. My advice to potential customers is to drive the extra 3 miles and go to Lambs Shoe Repair in Mesa!

I could not disagree more with the previous review! I use Davonna on a regular basis and she is the BEST massage I have ever had. I have been getting massages for at least 10 years and never, had I had a better massage. She really knows the pressure points and knows the body.  I would not hesitate in recommending her. She is by far...THE BEST! Thanks Davonna!
