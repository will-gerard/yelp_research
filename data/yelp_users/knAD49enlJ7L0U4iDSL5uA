What can you say about Taco Bell other than fresh and still reasonably affordable. Consistently quality food. Wish there were more around to be honest...:)

This is one of the best quaint  "morning energy" spots Arizona has to offer. 5 Stars for bringing this market style vibe to one of the nicer communities in Arizona--Arcadia. I love the Rueben, but not all the food is equal to the price. But here's the point: It doesn't matter. It's a great community hotspot (not a far stretch to say up and coming landmark)  that sets itself above most all other choices. Set up your Wi Fi, enjoy the music, the aromatic sense of entrepreneurship, thriving families and a laid back regal approach to your morning brew.

I'm a Walmart fan and I can only say this, the main water fountains at this location was out for several weeks. It's not necessarily located in a savory part of town, but the prices were the same inside as they would be anywhere else so...   They had some hard working employees also but avoid this one if you can.

I find AAA to be one of the best decisions I've ever made as an auto owner. Top notch customer service with no frustrations thus far and I'm a member for the last 5 years. Highly recommend them to everyone.

Unless you're getting a medical marijuana license or need your check cashed, there aren't many reasons to visit the Wilshire Plaza in Scottsdale. That is, except for Atlas Bistro--a quaint little BYOB diamond in the rough. Keep in mind my visit last night was during restaurant week, but my previous visits didn't disappoint either. I will say right up front that for 40 bucks, I don't think I could have done better.  I won't break down the entrees other than to say, if you consider yourself a foodie, go. You won't be disappointed. All the entrees enjoyed by my date and I were well thought out with great flavor and generous portions as well. Bring your own bottle or buy from the adjacent wine store. My only complaint is the 10 uncork fee. I think it should be 5.  Berkshire pork shank confit had an amazing cabbage and other accoutrements that enhanced each bite and was my highlight to a great dinner. My date loved the Hawaiian ahi tuna tataki. All in all, great food at a reasonable price.

Let me put it to you this way: Subway is next door. Spend maybe 4 or 5 more bucks at Scratch, wait 15 more minutes, and you have freshly prepared, healthy, well-thought entree's, sandwiches, salads, etc... Depending on your taste and how quickly you need to leave, the choice is clear in my world (no offense to Subway).  For the price, location and especially, the food, it's a great little-tucked away-secret. If you have ever used your name and the word "foodie" in the same sentence and don't  make an effort to stop by, you may be missing out.  This is really a quaint little lunch place or even dinner but remember you're there for the food. Service is not over the top, nor bad either. Sit back, relax, and enjoy. I did.

It's this simple: how many good English Pubs with outstanding English Pasties (a folded pastry case filled with seasoned meat and vegetables) do you know of in the Valley? Exactly... If you don't know what a good English--yet conspicuously American influenced--pub is like, this is your best shot in Arizona.   The food is well thought out and straight forward. Some of the Pasties may be a bit more flavorful than your traditional English oriented places but the flavors are wonderful, and I dare say, healthy. There is a Pasty for you in there somewhere!   This vegetarian and vegan friendly atmosphere is a find for those who want to sit back, enjoy a pint and enjoy a candlelit evening and relax for the day. If you're looking for "vibe," you found your new place. The atmosphere reflects a relaxed and soulfully sophisticated crowd. Nothing bad to say about this place.

This place is so poorly managed and aweful, it's difficult to make an emphasis. They just don't care about their service. At all... So odd...

Straight to the point: I was ripped off when I paid cash for a bill by one of the representatives.

I find it hard to take the time to write an adequate review about places that bore me so this is all I have: It's not a bad Mexican place; there's simply nothing special about it. I had a variety of tacos and my date had a burrito. Our entrees were very average at above average prices.

I always wonder why more fast food places, especially major chains, don't offer Wi-Fi to their customers in this day and age. Who are these CEOs? I eat fast food as little as possible; but let's face it, when you're on the go and you're hungry, sometimes you have no choice. What brought me to Chick-fil-A? Wi-Fi. Why I will look no further next time? I have never received such service at a fast food restaurant in my life. Highlights: Wi-Fi, USA Today, they bring the food to your table, the staff are all competent and friendly. Some quotes, "the straws are going to be right behind you Mr. Kellar...have a seat anywhere and we'll be right with you." "Here you go sir, do you have everything you need?" and the reason for this yelp, "Can I get you a complementary refill while you work?" (as she cleans my table mind you). Are you kidding? Where am I? Isn't this fast food. Props to the team at this location and to Chick-fil-A. Some CEOs know what they are doing.

Great location for high-quality food, good service and a great feel. A west-side gem for a guy who has not had good experiences on the West side of the Valley. Check it out!

I got a thing for out of this world coffee and "earthy" chicks with a tattoo here and there; therefore, I love the Cartel Coffee Lab. The baristas are phenomenal as well as the vibe and music. The food is surprisingly fresh, yummy and fair priced. There is also a good selection of draft imports. It's a perfect hideaway from the pretentious neighborhood. Wi Fi has never been a problem. It's a 5 star coffee house in my world.

I love Rolling Rock on tap. Call me odd; But at 50 cents a college plastic cup, combined with very value priced rotisserie chicken, sides, sandwiches and wraps, chargrilled skewers that all taste well above any purchase in its price range (and some very high end places surprisingly), it would be silly to say, "Honey, I'm tapped, we can't go out tonight." You and your girl can drink, enjoy young college energy while eating great food and spend 25-30 bucks. That's if you spoil yourselves.

As a marketing and sales professional, I always find it "odd" (or professionally manipulated) how bad companies dominate the web with good ratings. Let me get to my point in capital letters -- IF YOU HAVE A BEDBUG INFESTATION, THIS IS NOT THE COMPANY FOR YOU!!!  Roughly two months ago, "Chris" came to my apartment upon a call from my landlord when I discovered that I did indeed have a bedbug infestation. I knew nothing about them, nor of their vicious nature, but at 3 AM (after discovering bites and frantically inquiring on Google) I learned that they are indeed one of the most pervasive and vicious parasites on the planet for the human host. And when Chris arrived, his inspection was a matter of coming into my apartment, lifting my king size mattress and saying, "I've seen a lot of cases and this isn't a big one, you should see improvement in about 7 to 10 days..." Chris never checked any other room in the two bedroom apartment which, even then, I found very strange and completely reprehensible now.  Since it was the landlord's responsibility for treatment, I had no options and Chris only gave me two of them: which was $150 and a $400 spray treatments. He didn't even mention a heat treatment. Chris attempted to submit me with the bid of $400, all the while knowing it wasn't my responsibility-it was a landlord's responsibility in the state of Arizona.  45 days later, and two chemical treatments later by this company--I have abandoned my apartment and everything in it to avoid more torture from the parasites. I.E.-the bedbugs are still amazingly active and the two treatments didn't work! My former neighbors have witnessed me spending hours trying to cleanse myself and my property constantly in vain. If I can emphasize one thing, this is it: I had no idea what that was about to face. When I asked both Chris and the employee that followed for treatment if they had any advice for me, Chris said," you'll be fine..." That was it-that was the professional advice on one of fastest growing epidemics (look it up) in the United States--"you'll be fine..." Unscrupulous, unprofessional, and unthinkable. Because of this company, I've lost thousands of dollars in property (including an infected Infiniti Q 45) and will soon be in litigation with them. Indeed, all I needed was a little education, an honest look at a pervasive problem and the steps that followed their ineffective treatments.  Despite this company's high ratings on Yelp, I highly recommend you do some serious shopping. This  may be a bigger pest control company in Arizona, but they are completely unprofessional and frankly, a little sloppy.  iF YOU HAVE BED BUGS, HEAT IS YOUR ONLY REAL, EFFECTIVE AND VIABLE SOLUTION.  As indicated, Chris said, "you'll be fine..." Thousands of dollars later, I'm a little far from fine. Don't suffer as I did. If you have a bedbug infestation and capitulate to a chemical treatment, I highly doubt you'll be fine for any reasonable amount of time. If it's roaches, ants or insects, I'm sure this company will do you okay as it's a pretty simple process to treat. But who wants to deal with an unscrupulous company? I feel so strongly about this that if you're looking for advice on bedbugs, please feel free to contact me on Yelp. No one should have to go through what I went through because they were wrongly informed by a money driven company who takes advantage of your lack of knowledge... I will have solid advice for you. They will tell you that you're fine.

It's rare that you find a place that is exactly what you've been looking for in a conversation spot, a pre-drink, a hang-out and "let's go there" without experiencing a parking problem and obnoxious patrons. As I have experienced it, the Pigs Meow appears to be one of the Phoenix/Arcadia concepts that has scored dramatically and is drawing a lot of attention in only two months. You'll love this place. I love it so much I'm holding off my review so I can enjoy the synergistic and soulfully crafted environment for now...
