I dont know how this place stayed open. The last thing I ordered was horrible it was something simple that I figured couldn't be messed up: Chicken Fried Rice... the chicken was dark and hard, the taste was horrible. I tried the place again hoping for a better visit... not impressed.

Its pretty much always busy. It plays some ghetto music at times. It has good beer. Goodnfood, not the best. Lots of pool tables. It's exactly what you would expect.

Their new menu is good but wow no sense of urgency with the staff. It's a Sunday there's a bunch of open seats and we waited 15 mins to get any ones attention. Now it's been 15 mins were just waiting for our drinks. Luckily we ordered our food with the drinks but come on. Even if you're a little short show that you are trying to be quick or get people who will be.

Super nice staff. Random craving for arbys and really wanted a shake. The machine was down and the guy was so sorry he insisted I chose a turn over for free.  Great customer service from all the staff

This place is awesome. I have been going for years. The beer is always great, sometimes under poured but I'll let it oass. The food is awesome. The hummus is great, pizza, sandwhiches. I recently had the Texas dip. It had great flavors. I was a little thrown off with all the Texas themed stuff seeing as its a local arizona brewery. The server was great. We had three other employees bump into our table on the patio causing our drinks to spill and second time the au jus all over your pants and she looked and me and said nothing and walked away. That's the only downfall! I will be back

It's a great place to wait 20 minutes plus for an incorrect sandwhich. Don't bother informing the manager Barbara either. She'll insist she personally made the sandwhich and made the order as it appears on your receipt which is still not true. It was ridiculous how the manager was not very customer friendly. Would have loved this place if we got an apology instead of a defensive manager. Waste of time. Also plan to wait and watch other and larger food orders go out before yours as they ordered after you. Won't be going back to this location.

Their juice and smoothies are so fresh. A little higher in price than some places. I had the Venice burner and am craving another one!

Best service I've had from subway in a long time. The shift leader was awesome. Easily the best around town. Will be going to this one even though one is closer to my house

This Starbucks is closest to my house. As in a block away but I have been here several times and typically drive to any further location to avoid here, today there were two cars in the drive thru, not bad, well that took about 15 mins to get our orders, she gave me the wrong order and still didn't get it right. If you want to get coffee at a faster pace and that is your order avoid here.

I wish I could give no stars. Just awful every time. Why even bother. Never get orders right or you pull up and when you say it's not the right total so probably not the right order (said ten dollars pull up now two) the girl looks at you like you're wrong. It's always a hot mess.

Always delicious!! I wish more people came here to give them more business as well as their location in Ahwatukee.   Only thing they need to work on is staffing. Everyone is so nice but they need more help. Sometimes the ones taking the orders cook as well making people who walk in wait and I saw people walk out after waiting so long.   Foods delicious!!! The lunch special with the beef is outstanding and the green chicken panini is a must.

We found this place on yelp when crepe bar was closed. Wow how happy are we! It's a very small place,  about 10 tables inside and a few on the front side walk. The food is awesome. I had the spaniard omelette and my friend had the quiche. We will be back again. The service was very good.

The customer service here is great! Everyone is there to answer any questions, give recommendations, and help you pick out what is good for you. It was my first time so I got a couple things from the breakfast and lunch. I got the "Good Morning Sunshine" breakfast- wow it was great, I will get many more. The Ginger Sesame bowl- it was so delicious, I didn't read it had no meat in it, but it was still good!   I got two of the overnight oats, the carrot cake and cherry chia... We both couldn't finish ours, we personally did not like them at all. They tasted off- almost sour after taste, I can't really describe it other than gross. I wont get those again but I will be back for sure to try them out!

Went here for the first time after seeing coupons come in the mail and driving by.  When we first walked in, no one acknowledged us we wondered if we seat ourselves or what. Finally we went up to the bar and they said sit wherever after we asked. So sit wherever. Out sever was great!! Very nice girl with good pointers on the menu.  We got the wings, spicy ranch and honest mustard. Ok the wings have awesome crispness and are so tender on the inside. The honest mustard was great. The spicy ranch I was sooo excited for but I couldn't get past the fishy taste since they fry them in the same as fish. I do not like fish so it was hard to enjoy them. Totally separate fryers that would be awesome. And the honest mustard make a spicy version :) please! We will be back. So happy we found the place. Very diverse crowd too. It's a place for all.

Always love coming here! Wish they had one in chandler but that's just me wanting it all! Kosmic Karma is definite favorite and so is the Thai dye pizza. Their crust is awesome! Their beer selection is great. Happy hour is wonderful. Can't complain at all!

I bet it's fun when you get the right stuff. Took an hour to get my order... Which ended up not being what I ordered at all. I ordered prime rib sliders. I got cheeseburger sliders with a side of au jus... Who honestly let that leave the kitchen? Also prefers a beer and got brought a second without asking and wash charged for it. Forget it, I won't waste my time here

Was really looking forward to having them come out... Twice. First time I set up online booking and got an email later saying they would have to reschedule. Scheduled again for an upholstery cleaning and got the confirmation email and all looked good to go to start at 9:30 and finish around 11 am. Called the company around 10:30, he was familiar with my appointment and said they cancelled it. No call. No email. Wasted my morning and time off work for this. Completely let down.

Nice gym and very clean. Would be nice to have heavier free weights and an actual squat rack for those who could use them. Also I don't like that they do pizza nights... It's nice but maybe a healthy alternative would be great! Say no to the pizza post work out!

Super delicious! I don't mind the wait at all for the food because you know it's being cooked fresh! It's a small " mom and pop" type so they run the show for the most part so expect a little wait for the food but it's worth the extra time! Add an egg to the brown rice!

EVERYTHING. Everything here is delicious! Whether it is a smoothie or a grain bowl. Super impressed and happy to have found this place. The moroccan mac and cheese is awesome and same with the Southwest. I love the Energy Elevator as a smoothie. Its like a choco banana shake but with a little coffee hint at the end.

Was driving around looking for a sandwhich olace and rememebered seeing this before. We decided to stop in and wow. Theres around 150 sandwhich choices but they have certain sections that are divided up by the meat. I went with the toy wood, it was so good. The customer service was amazing and its rare to come aa cross it these days.

I've been here a few times and I've never been disappointed. One person said their chicken was dry but they also ate their meal 2 hours later so. Tastes great. Fair prices. I will be back definitely. Never had a problem with customer service. They have a range of Hawaiian canned drinks that taste great. They have one tv that always has sports on:)
