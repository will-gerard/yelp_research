I have rented fro A-Z a few times in the last couple years. Mainly for yard maintenance equipment but they also have party supply items as well. They have always have what I need. Their staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Their prices are fair.

We had a birthday party for my daughter and needed more seating. My wife called in the reservation and I picked them up. The man at the counter recognized me from previous visits. They have such great customer service. Great place for all your rental needs.

Such a fun place for kids and parents both.  Great place to make gifts or just to have fun.  So fun.

This place is so good! Their service was very prompt, even with the wait. I would give 5 stars if it were not for the very uncomfortable wait. There is no where to go. Very small "lobby" for lack of a better term.  The Mac n cheese was awesome with sausage and bacon. Amazing. My other half had the spaghetti and she really enjoyed it as well.

Great place.... coaches are stern but likeable.  Not the best parking or room in viewing area but still great!

We have ordered from Pink Lotus often for several years now.  Our last two houses are within the delivery area. It's not amazing! But its good.  Yes, if you choose to pick up, the inside is creepy. Really weird mural painted inside. Their delivery times are kinda hit or miss. Sometimes its a very long wait but I am lazy so it works. I will sit and complain how hungry I am rather than go see that creepy goat or whatever it is on a mural.

Helpful staff, good selection ... there has never been a time that they haven't had something that I needed.  Good selection of gear and apparel too.

Five of my friends and I stopped at Native last night for Happy Hour. We were trying to keep an open mind about our visit at first.  Our server was young and seemed a little inexperienced for the amount of tables she had. She wasn't very friendly...didn't add to the experience.  When were first came in we asked her what was in one of their signature drinks, she had no clue nor did she ask anyone. After we all ordered and she was gone we found it in another menu...oh, that sounds good. I probably would have got that.  Oh well, first strike.  Most of us were not that hungry so really we should have been a pretty low maintenance table. We ask for second round, chips and salsa and some wings.  She comes back five min later with the wrong drink.  Comes back with a new one Stella on tap. Still no chips and salsa. We are watching our buddys beer and the "head" on this thing keeps growing and growing. We were making fun of it. Our other buddy orders his second Stella same thing, they said it tasted weird. I make a joke to the waitress about their strange beer and she says "yea, well no one ever orders that so..." "So, what I say, they have old chunky beer?" She disappears again.  We are going on 30 min here...still no wings...still no chips and salsa. Were snag her in passive and asked about the wings. You could tell by her face she never put the order in.  We talked to a manager who seemed pretty uninterested in talking with us. Of coarse the comp'd items off the bill which we didn't even care. We just wanted to feel like they actually cared about the service we received, they did not.  Me giving a 2 rather than a one is simply out of kindness... We saw that the management set our waitress up for failure, so I took it easy. They really earned a 1.

Great bagels! Not the best atmosphere but good coffee and bagels. Fair prices, friendly staff... I will definitely go there more often.

Good food, great staff. There is usually a bit of a wait whenever we go but that is our fault for waiting around and getting stuck in the church crowd.

Absolutely adorable!  We are looking forward to holding our commitment ceremony at Virginia's House.  We were referred to Natalie after our previous venue, Pinnacle Vista Villa, fell thru. Natalie was so helpful and accommodating and really set our mind at ease. Needless to say we will be able to sleep tonight knowing that our plans are back on track.  Thank you.

Not much of a resort. I would have been very disappointed if we would have got a room there for a true resort stay.  We stayed there for the Cavecreek Wicked Halloween event. They did have a 24 hr shuttle which was great in that situation. The room was still better than the drunk tank but not by much. The room was very dated.  It didn't even have a fridge.  The lobby and grounds were nice for the most part but all in all I was not impressed. I have stayed at Holiday Inn Expresses nicer.

My fiancee and I go there all the time. Their mango martini's are the best. Their women's VIP card is awesome.

I am generally against going and spending so much money on coffee but this morning I decided to treat myself.  I will say that the girls genuinely put a smile on my face. Being in Customer Relations, if I could get my staff to be half as excited and cheerful I would be delighted. The coffee was good but the staff was great.

My fiancee and I just recent started using this 24 hour fitness. We used LA Fitness for years but didn't like the crowd or atmosphere much. So, far I am very pleased.    The staff is friendly, the facility is clean and our 9 year old loves the kids room.   There is a small shop inside as well for supplements, bottles and even workout attair.  They are never super super packed which is nice.  You do not have to wait around for equipment.  All in all I am pretty please, I would certainly recommend.

The previous review for this location is sad.  The staff is very friendly, we have never had any issues with the store.  We have been using this location for 5 years now and we are very happy customers.

Super convenient. Nice clean rooms. What more can you ask for. We got a room there so we could safely enjoy ourselves at the bars. Good price too.

I had my first boot camp session today with a friend that recommended me. I will say that I am not in the shape that I was in 10 years ago in real boot camp. Shane lead the session and it kicked my butt.  We did 3 different circuits.  Lots of wall sits, kettle bells, medicine balls, planks and some running. There were 9 or 10 people there, which I hear is a smaller session. Shane was motivational but tough. He corrected form when needed. All in all it was a fun time. I may edit the latter part of this review when I cannot get out of bed tomorrow morning.  Thank you Shane and I will definitely recommend you and Task Fitness.

Beware...this venue is not licensed to hold events. They have pissed off their neighbors and they have made their life a living hell. The area is not zoned properly.  They have to do grading to the mountain, install sprinkler system, add an additional bathroom, meet handi- capped accessibility...a lot of work. We are trying to get ahold of the venue to try and get our money back.  Stay tuned... Read filtered reviews.
