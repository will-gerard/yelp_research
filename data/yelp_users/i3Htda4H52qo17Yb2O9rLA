It's taken me months (about 6 actually) to find a nail salon that lives up to my OCD expectations. I've been here twice now, and both times my expectations were surpassed. I've had a different tech for each service and each were pleasant and efficient as well as a perfectionist.  I'm in the middle of my pedicure as I review, but so far so good. I'll probably even get my eyebrows waxed here on my next visit. Now that's trust!

I LOVE that I can order healthy, pre-cooked meals delivered to my front door through the "Lifestyle Nutrition" section. It saves me time, money, and guilt (sometimes I just don't want to cook for my fianc√© after working and working out). Plus, it makes sticking to a "diet" easier since I rarely have to step into a grocery store and be enticed by the junk/impulse buys. Our favorites are the chicken fajitas, pancakes, chicken kabobs, and the individual cooked meats make meal planning for the week SO EASY! Throw in the Rod, the nicest guy, for quick responses and amazing delivery...you can't go wrong!

My dryer broke down, and the last thing I wanted to do was sit at a laundromat on a Sunday. To my surprise, this place didn't make me mind so much.   The staff was super friendly and helpful (actually the guy who owned the place helped me get started, and you could tell he was just an all around nice guy).   If my dryer is repaired or replaced soon, this is where I'm going. Dryers dried ($.45/10 mins) well and the double load washers ($2.30) we're quick and cleaned well. Facility was clean. Not packed until about noon.

My new obsession! This place is clean, the staff is SUPER nice, and everything we've tried is awesome!! The almond milk tea and kiwi green tea w/strawberry boba are my two favs so far. I have a feeling I'll be here at least once a week!

Professional and friendly; I couldn't have asked for better service! I had an amazing experience with Showcase Mobile Detailing! It's hard to find a company willing to go above and beyond the way they did. My car is as clean as the day I purchased it thanks to them. I will be using them again and again.

Hands down, the BEST Greek I've had in AZ.  It all started when a dog rep brought us lunch from Greek's Grill. Since that day, I literally jump for joy when I hear it's waiting for us in the break room. Let me just tell you that it's even BETTER fresh off the grill at the restaurant. I seriously could eat here everyday and not become bored. We met Fred tonight, and he is just the sweetest man. I will gladly visit this local establishment over those chain restaurants from here on out.  Thanks for the hospitality and wonderful food, Greek's Grill!!

My good friends surprised me with some cupcakes from Top It for my Valentine Birthday treat. The red velvet and salted caramel were AMAZING!! They were so delicious, I went myself a few days later to give to my boyfriend to try. The malt ball was moist and flavorful, and my boyfriend loved the vanilla with chocolate. I'm dying to try the cotton candy and PBJ flavors.

Props to the Drunk Genius that invented the Totchos here. Brilliant.   Service was up to par for a slightly busy lunch service.   Our only two recommendations are: 1) Add a little spice/flavor to the hummus plate. 2) Open a location in Gilbert.

Bottom line: This location needs remedial wrapping classes for preparing their unwiches. We've been here multiple times for our low-carb Jimmy John fix, and EVERY TIME both of our unwiches start off with "insides" falling out because they aren't wrapped correctly (we'll go out of our way to go to the Germann location because  they seem to get it right).   I don't know...small problem? It doesn't help that the time before tonight's run, they forgot our chips at the drive through. I know what you're thinking; listen, I give up the bread so I can have chips. Don't judge me.

We visited on a Saturday night as a 4 top. Half of us had been here previously when it was Tien Wong's Hot Pot and raved about it. Personally, I was disappointed. The service was slow and about 20 mins after we submitted our order, we found out they were out of shrimp (no heads) and the chicken. Really? On a Saturday evening at 7:40pm? Thumbs up for planning ahead...(eye roll).  The food was, over all, ok. My favorite part was the watermelon tea though. I'll possibly go back to try some of the other teas and sit on the ramen side.   Oh, and don't forget it's BYOB and they charge an uncorking fee.  As my boyfriend pointed out, this place has a good game going. You bring your own booze, they charge you to open it, they entice you with options only to run out of them so you pick more expensive protein, and then they make you cook it yourself. Talk about low overhead! LOL
