I'm a huge breakfast lover. I can have French toast, crepes, or omelets at all hours of the day or night. When I was told that the Paris had an amazing crepe place I practically started running toward it. But when I finally saw the restaurant I got kind of bummed. I was expecting an actual restaurant and not a walk-up stand. But after realizing that it's supposed to resemble the walk-up creperies in Paris, France I was okay with the idea.  The line didn't take too long (maybe fifteen minutes or so) but when we're all about to eat our left hands out of hunger, fifteen minutes feels like an eternity. Finally we got to the front of the line. The menu has several savory crepes with meats and cheese as well as dessert crepes with berries, whipped cream, and other sugary additions.  I pretty much only like dessert crepes so my eyes lit up when I saw their abundance of fruits and sauces. I went with the Favorite crepe (with fresh berries, whipped cream, and topped with raspberry coulis). It was served to me at the pick-up counter on a cafeteria trey and a plastic plate. Lame. I then had to turn the corner and grab a plastic knife and plastic fork. Lame. Then came the really fun part; watching over people like hawks until a table opens up. The small seating area is just next door to La Creperie but it's open to anybody that wishes to sit there (surrounding snack stands, or people just giving their bunions a break).  After a couple minutes, we snagged a table and began digging in to our lovely crepes. They were almost impossible to cut into. The plastic utensils, plastic plates, and plastic treys made the crepes slide about relentlessly. After finally wrangling the thing down and cutting it up I got to taste it. Sheesh. I now understand why people were telling us to go here. The crepes were fantastic. However, I was somewhat distracted while we were eating. Several Miss America pageant girls came in and sat at the table next to us, fully equipped with tiaras and sashes. Awesome.  A tip after eating at La Creperie, go just across the walkway and pick up one of the humongous Eiffel Tower margaritas. You won't be disappointed!

Even though I'm giving Fix a one star rating, the food was rather good. To be fair I'll give a full review and then switch gears at the end...  I was in Las Vegas last month with my company for Magic (the huge fashion convention) and on our first night in town we decided to go out and have a fancy company dinner. After several calls to multiple restaurants we finally decided on Fix in the Bellagio.  We showed up Sunday evening around 9pm and the place was completely packed. Luckily we thought ahead and made a reservation. In just a few minutes our table for six was ready.  To get the night going we ordered a couple bottles of wine. We took our time looking over the menu and even longer making our final decisions. Everything on the menu seemed delicious! I landed on the lobster tacos (with grilled mango, and cilantro) to start. The four small tacos came on a serving plate that perfectly fit each taco. The shells were crispy and the lobster was fresh and juicy. The small cilantro leaves were a great way to make the lobster flavor pop even more.  For my entree I got the seabass (with risotto, baby shrimp, and lobster broth). The cut of fish was cooked perfectly and when I cut into it the lobster broth soaked in and made the bass even more delicious. The baby shrimps were nice additions as well and were cooked just right.  The night was going great up to this point. The food was delicious and the service was top notch. It was a great night to celebrate our first night in Sin City. That is until my boss found a safety pin in her risotto (see photo I included). Yes, a safety pin! You know, those incredibly sharp objects that can stick in your throat if ingested. Yep, those things. Thankfully she saw it before she unknowingly ate it. Of course, we immediately called for the manager as our server took the dish away.  The manager told us that this "doesn't happen that often". Hmm, so it has happened before? How could a safety pin even land in someone's food? If I find a hair in my meal the review instantly drops down to 3/5 stars and I expect the meal to be free. But a SAFETY PIN is completely inexcusable. The real kicker was that my boss didn't receive a new entree and when we got the bill her dish wasn't even comped. Instantly we called for the manager again and made sure her meal was free. Honestly we were completely shocked that the entire meal wasn't comped when a mistake that dangerous has happened.  When dining out at high-end restaurants it's expected that your experience will be flawless, especially when you're paying these extreme prices. When something as outrageous as a safety pin finds its way in a customer's dinner, I, as well as the rest of my co-workers, would expect the restaurant to do anything and everything it can to remedy the mistake. Unfortunately the restaurant failed on every level and fully deserve such a low rating. So please, be sure to inspect every bite while dining here!

Before going to Las Vegas for my best friend's 21st birthday I asked around a bit for recommendations of restaurants to take him to. The typical suggestions were given (Michael Mina, Joël Robuchon, etc) but one name stood out in my mind; B and B Ristorante. I did my research on the place and found out that it's on the amazing list of Mario Batali owned restaurants. Perfect. The same friend and I just recently went to Manhattan for my college graduation and we ate at multiple Batali restaurants (Lupa and Pó) which both blew us away. I've also dined at his Los Angeles restaurant, Pizzeria Mozza (next door to Osteria Mozza). Each and every time I've dined at a Batali owned restaurant my stomach has left extremely happy and my wallet isn't too hurt. B and B was a perfect choice to celebrate my friend's second birthday dinner.  B and B is inside the very classy Venetian Hotel and is tucked on Restaurant Row. It's Friday night in Vegas so the casino floor is bumpin' and there are suits and cocktail dresses galore while walking to the restaurant. Thankfully we came prepared and were sporting our suits as well. After walking the million or so steps through the humongous hotel/casino we arrived in front of B and B and were happily greeted by the two gorgeous hostesses. We then were led to our seats against the "window" in a cozy half booth half table. Sitting by the window was great because the people watching outside couldn't be beat. Out of all the hotels we went to beforehand, the Venetian definitely had the most attractive, interesting, and fun-looking crowd.  Our extremely professional server came over to greet us and take our drink orders. Right away we felt as if we had been teleported off the bustling Las Vegas Strip and into a fine dining restaurant tucked under a stoop in NYC. After looking over the menu we came to our decisions.  To start, we got one order of calamari and seppie fritti to share. This was probably the best calamari I've tasted in my life. The sauce at the bottom complimented the calamari perfectly by adding a slight spice to each bite but not enough to knock you out of your chair. We devoured the dish pretty quickly and then sat back to wait for our pastas.  My friend and I are big pasta lovers so we stuck to the Primi section of the menu. My friend ordered the spaghettini (with spicy budding chives, sweet garlic and one-pound lobster). The second my friend said his order our server got ecstatic. He said it was one of their best dishes and also one of their most popular. He then described in great detail exactly how it is prepared as well as how each ingredient compliments the next. Whoa. "This guy knows his shit." For me, I got the goat cheese tortelloni (with dried orange and wild fennel pollen). Again, our pro-status server then described how it's cooked and how the ingredients would taste with each other. My friend's dish was amazing. It had a small kick of spice but the lobster helped even out the flavor. Also, the lobster was the most tender, melt-in-your-mouth lobster I've ever tasted. My dish was also fabulous. I'm sold immediately to any dish that is prepared with goat cheese and this dish didn't upset. The milky goat cheese gave an explosion of flavor with each bite and the tiny shavings of orange offered a different and interesting flavor every third bite or so.  Before our meal started I told our server very discretely that it was my friend's birthday. He said that if we order a dessert they will add a candle but they don't offer any special (by this I mean complimentary) birthday desserts. Hm, oh well. We ordered the dark chocolate torta (with spiced huckleberries). Sure enough, out came a candle and script writing on the side of the dish. It looked beautiful (as well as delicious). Needless to say, we devoured this thing pretty damn quick as well.  Being familiar with Mario Batali's cooking we both came in knowing exactly what to expect; an amazing meal. We both left very satisfied. We then proudly and excitedly crossed yet another Batali restaurant off our list.

On my recent trip to Las Vegas my stay was extended for an extra night due to snow on the freeway toward LA. It was a business trip so one of my coworkers and I decided to make the most of it and do a little bar hopping.  The Irish Car Bomb is one of my favorite drinks and my coworker had never tried one before. We made it a point to start the night off with one of those bad boys. I figured there was no better place than an Irish pub to celebrate his first Car Bomb.  We showed up Sunday night around midnight and the place was completely packed. The first thing we both noticed was how the place reeked of B.O. Shortly after that we realized how the place was full of old men in their 60's or later. Keeping in mind that a lot of places don't serve Car Bombs, we held our breath and fought toward the bar.  The bartender was nice and attentive and made our drinks really quick. There was even a great Irish band playing on the small stage in the middle of the bar. Several drunken dancers just happened to be flailing about with sections of the crowd cheering them on. Even though most of the crowd was old, the vibe was fun and the music was actually really good. However, once we finished chugging our drinks we aimed for the door and on to the next place...

Five stars? Whoa. This place was great. No, this place was perfect. A five star review says two things; the food is breathtaking and the service is impeccable. Biscayne is located in the newly renovated Tropicana Hotel and is hidden in a secret hallway that even Batman himself could not find. Seriously, we had to ask three different hotel employees where the hell it was. The headache to find the place was definitely, one million percent worth it.  My best friend was turning 21 so we did what most Americans do, we took a weekend trip to Vegas baby! When we checked into the hotel (Tropicana) I shamelessly shouted out that it was my friend's 21st. The lovely front desk attendant then notified the manager and he gave us a free $200 credit to their in-house restaurant; BISCAYNE! How awesome is that? We originally had reservations at a different restaurant but we changed the date immediately (duh) when we were given this free credit.  As I said before, the restaurant is pretty well hidden. We had 9pm reservations and we didn't want the $200 credit to go to waste so we stuck it out and kept searching. After finally finding the entrance we were a solid fifteen minutes late. It took us about thirty minutes to find it (and we were staying in the same hotel). Jeez. When we got there we were seated immediately even though we were late. To our surprise the place was completely empty. Usually I take that as a bad sign and become skeptical of the quality of the restaurant. That's exactly what I did here.  When we sat down we were given our table bread, butter, and water pretty quickly. The table bread gave us three choices, but I only tried one, a soft pretzel. My god. I've had a lot of amazing table breads in my day, but I think I can safely say this was the best one yet. We actually loved it so much that our sweetheart waitress gave us four of them to take back to our rooms after the meal was over.  To start, we ordered a couple appetizers to split between everyone. We got an order of kobe beef sliders (with tilamook cheddar cheese) as well as lobster bisque (with poached Atlantic lobster). Is it weird that we ordered one lobster bisque and passed it around the table? Don't judge. It was amazing and had huge chucks of lobster in it. I'm not going to lie, but I definitely had more than anyone else at the table. Score one for Kevin. The sliders dish usually only comes with three (there were four of us at the table). Our server asked us if we wanted to add just one slider to the dish so everyone gets their own mini burger. I thought that was nice because most restaurants will require you to buy an entire second order. The burgers themselves were great. The beef was juicy, but not greasy, and the tiny veggies complimented it perfectly.  Biscayne is primarily a steakhouse, however I'm not a steak fan. So much in fact that I would definitely be blacklisted if I were to live in Texas. But I'm okay with that. Anyway, my eyes went directly to the "sea" section of the menu. The two things that stuck out most to me were the halibut and the salmon. Someone else at the table ordered the halibut so I decided to get the wild Atlantic salmon (with chipotle pineapple yogurt sauce and seasonal vegetables). The chef prepared that salmon so perfectly that I purposely wasn't given a knife. As soon as I cut into the first bite (with my fork) I could tell how amazing it was. The pineapple yogurt sauce was fabulous as well. Usually fruity sauces can overpower and ultimately destroy the flavor of the fish (in my opinion) but this was done perfectly and the amount wasn't overbearing whatsoever.  To go along with my seafood obsession I got a side order of lobster mac and cheese. Whoa. Just... whoa. I honestly can't write a review on the mac and cheese because the written word cannot do it justice. Lets just simply say that it's a must order. You're welcome in advance.  For dessert my friend got a birthday dish (complete with candle). It was key lime cheesecake. Being the nice guy I am, I put aside my cheesecake fetish and only tried one tiny bite. I didn't want to completely devour my best friend's birthday cake even though every urge in my body was telling me I should. The one bite I had was just enough to add it to the five star rating.  Even though Biscayne is hard to find, I'll say again, it's completely worth it. I want to personally build a brick wall in front of it so it doesn't get revealed to the general public. I even thought about purposely writing a horrible review so people wouldn't want to dine here. I'm selfish, and I want Biscayne all to myself. But being only the second to write a review I owe it to the chef and wonderful staff to give them the glory they deserve. Now I can't think of a catchy way to end a review that gives so much praise so I'll give it my best shot...  Biscayne, until we meet again... that'll do pig, that'll do.

My friend and I had an overnight layover in Phoenix while flying across the country. Luckily my friend has family in the area so we asked them to show us around and maybe try some good ol' Southwest grub. They all said we had to try Five Guys Burgers and Fries. So after making the trek over to Tempe we finally arrived. Meh... When we said Southwest grub we didn't have fast food in mind. Plus I've now heard there are Five Guys locations all over the place.  Living in Southern California, amazing fast food burger joints isn't a new thing to me. After trying Five Guys I'll gladly stick to Tommy's or In N Out.
