Wings were outstanding. Lots of meat, still had some crisp to them even after pick-up, sauce was pretty flavorful for medium.  Pizza was good, a bit on the salty and greasy side. Good for the "drunchies."

Jess' fiancee here, D.  I moved to Tempe from Ohio 2 months ago, and as far as burgers have gone, I've been extremely disappointed. "In-n-Out" is supposed to be a legendary chain on the west coast, and I was let down extremely. Smashburger wasn't any better either. So, I talked it over with Jess, and she suggested The Chuck Box.   Suffice to say, this blew every other place away. I ordered "The Great Big One" a little prematurely, as I saw the "Tijuana Torpedo" only after I ordered :/  Anyway, the burger itself was cooked to a medium perfection. Incredibly fresh, seasoned throughout...couldn't have been a better patty. The bacon was probably the nicest surprise. Cooked, but not too crispy. Also, IT'S IN THE SHAPE OF YOUR BURGER. Ingenious.  The condiment bar was a nice addition as well, but shredded lettuce/onions/etc. is a pain in the ass.  The only complaint I have is with the bun, they just don't seem up to par with containing the burger. Pretty bland. The beer was pretty reasonably priced too, it made watching LA winning the Stanley Cup just a little more bearable.  That being said, this is my second/third favorite burger place of all time; they do nearly everything right.  4.5/5 stars for The Chuck Box, I'll definitely be back a lot of times in the future.

I'm Jessica's fiancee. But still, our experience last night compelled me to write this review.  Anywho, I'm relatively new to Arizona, just moved here about 2 months ago. The food here, especially the pizza, is of a much higher quality than what I'm used to from most places back in Columbus, Ohio. That being said, I have run into a disaster of a pizza place already (Jamie's Pizza and Pitas.) So, we immediately set out the next night to make amends.  The interior of the shop has a very laid back vibe, mostly clean; but still some icky tables here and there.   She ordered a white pizza, I ordered a plain cheese, 6 medium wings, and 2 draft beers (don't worry, one was for Jess!)  Our first sign that we could tell this place was going to be a hit was when the cashier forgot to ring up 2 beers on the order, so she gave us one of our pints for free; even upgraded it to a Devil's Ale instead of a Coors. I went to San Tan Brewery within my first week here, so I was extremely happy this was on tap somewhere else.  Onto the Food: The wings were extremely fresh, although they were on the dry side. Decent flavor to the sauce for only ordering Medium, but it's something I wouldn't get in the future.   The pizza's were great, although i think the crust could've used a minute less in the oven. Still, there was a nice, fresh chew to it; very hearth-y. The cheese was the star of the show, especially on the white pizza. Melted to perfection, and extremely generous on both pies. The sauce, however, seemed to be the only flaw. That paste-like texture is never really a good thing, although, it was nowhere near the worst sauce a pizza has seen. The white pizza had a nice garlic infusion, but wasn't overpowering in the least. The first white pizza I've had that I can truly say I've liked.  TL;DR: 5 stars for the excellent customer service, comped craft beer, and extremely cheesy pizzas. This place has become my go-to joint, along with Venezia's.

Jess' fiancee here. Now, where to start...  First thing that came out was the house made limoncello. For $5, it looks like an awfully small drink. But, holy s***, does it hit the spot. The waitress wasn't lying when she said it was basically "everclear and lemon zest." One of those, and my drink tab was fulfilled for the night.   I ordered the Bocca Trio (sans olives,) and I've got to say, it was the best pizza I've ever had. The meat was perfectly salty, the texture of it almost blended into the cheese. The sauce was delicately applied, and the crust had a nice, light char. There wasn't a single thing about it that wasn't pizza ecstasy.  If you haven't been here, please, go.   Seriously, get off of yelp and go!

First off, the best way to get in/find parking is to turn onto 5th Ave. (off McDowell), take the first left (to head closer to 3rd Ave., where Hob Nob's is located). I park in front of any of the houses (obviously without red/yellow/fire hydrants) and have never had a problem finding adequate parking this way even on the nights where my group socials meet up at (50+ people in our group alone).   Tuesdays (at least for now), you can find a $1.95 bottle special (beer/cider) - take advantage of it if you like to partake, it's never been bad stuff and I hate most beers. 5/5 here.  I've had their alcoholic frozen margaritas - or whatever they were - those were good, and their smoothies were nice for my friend after she pierced her tongue. 5/5 here.  Yes, the art is overpriced in most cases, but it's nice to talk about it with your guest(s).  I like the live music they offer sometimes, and the environment/atmosphere. 4/5 here.  Food - I've only ever had their Greek/Mediterranean salad - the chicken was delicious and I enjoyed it. 4/5 here.  Staff: Has always been courteous, remembers my order but not in the "YOU'RE GETTING THIS AND ONLY THIS" way but the appreciative way where they actually take the time to get to know you. 5/5 here.

I'd give this place a 4.5 out of 5. Their cocktails were second to none, although the price is to be expected for the locale. Pretty much any liquor you could ask for was on hand, and I highly recommend the Caipirinha with Crystalized Sugar, or the Chartreuse Cooler.  As far as food goes, it's very good as far as a bar/lounge goes. Definitely has an Italian flair if you know the first thing about pizza (think Neapolitan style, but a tad more thin.) Even their prosciutto was above-par.  Ambiance was definitely unique. Unisex bathrooms, a lounge in an old department store...I can dig it.  Definitely worth a few visits...or many, since I love Caipirinhas.

We called at 10PM on a Saturday night - which might have affected the delivery time (55 minutes for 2-12" pizzas).   First sign: time it took for delivery. Second sign: our garlic knots weren't even sent out with the delivery guy.  For her, the pizza seemed salty and the dough didn't seem to be cooked long enough.   For him, they were generous with toppings. Aside from that, it was a disaster. Doughy, undercooked crust. Very bland, pre-made sauce. The cheese was the only thing they didn't completely get wrong.  Also, by generous with toppings, I mean that the white pie was *covered* in garlic. I usually pile on the garlic, but this was overkill; and became all that I could taste.  For pizza, I'm sticking by Venezia's and Barro's. Still need to try Spinato's, so no comparison there.  Even though the garlic knots were pretty tasty, it's still a one-star review. Save your money and go elsewhere.

Decent, for a $5 pizza joint. The sauce definitely had that pre-made, paste texture; which is a pizza sin. Although, the cheese was surprisingly fresh.  However, you're better off spending your $5 and getting a slice or two at somewhere else.

After reading all of the other reviews, I'm simply appalled at the criteria by which patrons judged this restaurant. I visited this restaurant with my boyfriend who had been a frequent visitor of BFGE. We were amazed at the atmosphere and selection. The food was spectacular and leaps and beyond better in terms of quality than BFGE. The price point matches the quality of food, along with the area. Please take the time to read every review thoroughly rather than view the rating. Most people ranked this place harshly low for minor inconveniences including price comparisons to BFGE, which had inferior food. Either way, give this place a chance.
