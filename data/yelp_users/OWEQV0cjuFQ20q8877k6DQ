The staff is very friendly. Food gets done fast and everything I've had is amazing. The bacon breakfast burrito is so good, so Is the three rolled taco meal, and the bean and cheese burrito . I could eat here everyday .. Red sauce is AMAZING.

I love this place! I brought my boyfriend here about a week or two ago because I crave it all the time. I usually get a chimichanga every time. The frozen strawberry margarita was sugary and amazing! The service is great and everyone is very friendly. The food is amazing! We will definitely be coming back :)

My mom and I decided to go here because she has always wanted to go there. So we go there there are 2 open tables. We wait about 15 minutes and no server ever acknowledged that we were there. Very rude people. We just got stared down by everyone and the servers. They wouldn't even look at us or anything. Very small place and very annoying place. We left and went to ihop and was greeted right away there. We will never try to go to farmers market again it was a waste of time.

I would usually put 5 stars but today I drove all the way home and they didn't give me fire sauce! I was mad, and so I went to another Taco Bell and they happily gave me my fire sauce. But the tacos from here were amazing :)

Okay... So I used to like this place. I ordered the carne asada fries no guacamole because I'm allergic sadly. The drive thru lady had an attitude problem and rolled her eyes at me when I'm pretty damn nice. Rude as hell... Then my food looks like crap fries are soggy yet somehow burnt, sour cream looks gross, barely any cheese at all... Tastes like cardboard I just wasted like 7-8 dollars on this. Only came here because Los favoritos was closed. Never again....

Everything i get here is amazing. When i can't afford a bunch of food i just get chips and salsa..and guacamole. Hot salsa has flavor even though its really hot, i love it. The staff is very friendly. I've never had a problem with anything at all.

So good! I come here whenever I can. I usually get chicken and cheese quesadilla. I will soon venture out and try something else! I could probably eat their chips and salsa everyday. The employees are very nice and welcoming also! Great service!

Went in and purchased my first e-cigarette! Kevin helped me out and told me everything I needed to know about my e-cig. I'm very pleased with my visit. I'm so excited about my e-cig! I got a pink one. :) thanks so much for teaching me the ways! I will be back!
