Frankly I was very disappointed with my experience today. I stopped using a different car wash place because of quality issues and have been happy with other Cobblestone locations, but this one was horrible. I brought my Mercedes R350 in for an oil change and wash. First of all, I was told they didn't have a filter for my car and that I should go get one at Walmart or something and bring it back. WHAT? Who does that? If I'm paying $70 for full synthetic and you don't have the filter, go get it! Needless to say I didn't get my oil changed. I then went to the wash line, I had to get out of the car before I was helped, never had that before. Then the quality of the wash, I had to finish it at home. The windows were spotty, there was a blue liquid dried all over, and let's just say it was almost as dirty as it was going in. The interior was not vacuumed well and the air fresheners were not changed out. Yes, I know what the old was looked like.  Horrible job, will not return and will recommend no one else use this location.

This was our first trip here. Wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. The yelp stars for here don't seem accurate. The food is wonderful, big portions at a good price. We are more than happy to return. Our server Andrea was very knowledgable and courteous. We had very quick service.

Sadly, I was going to give 3 stars, the food tastes wonderful, but, shortly after leaving there, both my son and I got violently sick. I will spare details, but it was not the flu. No return trip for this family! We had eaten the ground beef, my wife did not.

This was average at best. I frequented the Chicagoland locations years ago and always had an amazing experience. This one, not so much. The Portillos Dog was not impressive. A small dog with a cheap bun and a failed attempt with the weak fixings. That's just mine. My wife's Apple Walnut Chicken salad was bland, no taste whatsoever and overpriced. That is all to say about that. My son said his burger was good, but his chocolate shake was not. I tried it and it did taste like it was made with generic Hershey's syrup. Not planning a return visit anytime soon. If your visit was a better experience, congratulations.
