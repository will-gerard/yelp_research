I just moved to the neighborhood, and I LOVE this place. In fact, I should probably give it 5 stars, but I haven't had the sushi there yet. I always get a rice bowl, and the crispy tofu is delicious! I've also had the salmon, and I thought the flavor was great, but the portion was a little small. My favorite thing on the menu is the red curry crab bisque soup, which is out of this world! (I just wish they had a smaller portion that wasn't $5 because I feel like I end up buying 2 dinners).  We tried the rice krispies rolled in ice cream for dessert, and I didn't think that was all that great - it sounds better on the menu than it actually is. You won't be disappointed here.

Great pizza! Live music on the weekends (Friday and Sat. nights only, I think). Always a lot of people, but I've never waited for a table. Excellent service. The only pitfall is that there aren't a lot of food choices outside of pizza. A few calzones and sandwiches and very basic salads, but not much else. Still, it's called Fatso's PIZZA - so if you want pizza, check it out!

Great breakfast food for way cheap! WARNING: Only odd thing is that when you order an omelet with cheese, they put the cheese on the top, outside. So you have to ask for the sheese inside when you order.  Other than that, I'm becoming a regular. My husband and one of the servers always joke about the Cardinals (she's a huge fan) and when he went with my sister once without me, he said he got a few funny looks. THis is a great place for basic breakfast faves. Nothing fancy (you're all sort of crammed in there)  but really comfortable and good food.

Hands down the best vet I've ever seen. (I go to Dr. Kastner, not the other doc here, who seems very nice, too, but I've never worked with him.) He is patient and will thoroughly explain everything to you, including risks and benefits. Two of my dogs needed surgery, and he was very honest in referring me to a specialist for one of the surgeries, which he said he could do for less $$ than the specialist, but he thought the specialist would be better for it. He always remembers us when we come in, and unlike many vets we've seen, I never feel like he's just trying to "sell" us on anything. He doesn't push procedures that aren't really necessary, and he never makes you feel like a bad pet parent for considering not doing a procedure. His honest is unwavering - he'll tell you what's really necessary and why. If you're worried about your pet, this is where you'll get an honest ad unbiased medical opinion. The office staff is also always really nice.

This place adorable! The staff and owner are authentic Italian, and you can taste the authenticity in the food. They use the freshest ingredients and I believe they make everything there on site (as in, all the sauces, etc.). And when they bring the check, they bring everyone a free lemon-cello shot! The atmosphere is so cute and it's very intimate. A great date spot or a nice place to take visiting parents.

I had my wedding at this hotel, and it was awesome! First of all, about half of our guests came from NY, so you know they're picky. They were still talking about how great the food was months after our wedding. The hotel grounds are very well kept, and the place always looks immaculate. Best of all, the staff catered to our every need. They were actually anticipating what we might need and getting it to us before we had to ask. They sent my husband beer and snacks and a personal note the morning of the wedding while he was getting ready with his groomsmen, and they brought what was left of our cake out to us in the lobby the day after the wedding so we could sit there with our family and eat it right there in the lobby. I've never had such amazing service anywhere. (Oh, and during the wedding, they took my bouquet and all my bridesmaids bouquets and laid them all around our room, like around the tub, and they had strawberries and champagne waiting for us -- such a nice touch.) I HIGHLY recommend this place for hosting any occasion.

I love it here! Their sizzling tofu dish is awesome, and you usually get enough for three meals. Lots of veggie options, and my husband loves their orange chicken (as did I when I used to eat chicken). Ask for it spicy -- it's delish!

I really want to give this place a 5-star rating, but quite honestly, the service is pretty bad. I went last night for the second time, and the guy came out right away with water for me and my husband and our dogs, who we had with us. (Yes, it's dog friendly!) But then we ordered drinks (really good sangria and mojitos, and I don't say that about very many places.) And we had to wait forever for the drinks.  Then my sisters met us, and she had to ask three times for an ashtray. The food took forever, and the guys didn't come check on us nearly enough to the point that we were ordering two drinks a piece at a time. The servers are really nice, just not very on top of things. The food is awesome. My husband is a VERY picky eater, and he LOVES their reuben. They have lots of veggie options. The Farrago Lavosh is great, as is the Tuna Melt -- I highly recommend the tuna melt.  Overall, this place is outstanding, chill, fun and great for a casual group night -- just be prepared to wait.

I really liked this store! The jewelry is really cute, great gift ideas, fun books and cute clothes. The kids section (a whole separate room) looked really fun, too, but since babies aren't in my world at the moment, I didn't spend too much time there. I went in looking for a unique present for my sister's birthday, and I totally found it. My one complaint is that it's a little on the pricey side. Odd though, some things were very moderately priced, and other times I'd pick up a small, simple pair of earrings and find out they cost $60.

I went here for cosmetic reasons, and I had a terrible experience. Dr. Jazzayeri told me to use this special face wash and lotion, which I assumed was a prescription. Then at checkout, I come to find the sell it there for somewhere around $60. I googled it when I got home and found out that Dr. Jazzayeri's partner developed this line, and they sell it exclusively there (and online).  They also gave me a "chemical peel" which was just some liquid they applied with a giant Q-tip, and several weeks later I got a statement from my insurance saying that they tried to bill Humana $150 for the "chemical peel." They hadn't told me there would be any charge. Dr. Jazzayeri didn't even look at my skin close up, and he spent as much time trying to sell me a package of laser hair removal from his laser clinic as he did talking about my skin condition. Oh, and he prescribed me an antibiotic that comes out to about $550 per month. My insurance wouldn't cover it, but he gave me some card from the drug manufacturer that allows me to get the prescription filled three times at a reduced cost (no more than $25 max each time, depending on the pharmacy). Now that those three refills are up, I guess I'm going off the antibiotic. I'm definitely not going back to this doctor.

This is one of my and my husband's favorite restaurants in town. Every time we take someone there, they love it, too! And every time we try something new, it's better than the last thing. I typically get the Pad Thai, and my husband's fave is the Phad-See-Ew. I'm also a big fan of both the red and the green curry. You really can't go wrong here.  They expanded maybe a year ago, so it's been updated a little, but the place is still small and doesn't look like much from the street (or the strip mall it's' in). Still, the service is always good and fast, and it's BYOB. Don't miss this hidden gem!  PS. I like spicy, but a 2 ther (on a scale of 1-5) is still pretty hot.

You get a TINY (tiny) burger for like 5 bucks, so to get a decent amount of food, you're buying like a $15 burger -- oh yeah, and fries cost extra. Seriously. If you're going out for a burger (salmon, in my case) go for the real deal and skip the scene.

I prefer Harkins to AMC or any other theater, but I hate this location. I admit, this is where I see most movies, but only because it's SO close to my house. If it weren't, I'd make the trip elsewhere or go to an AMC. Here's the problem: All the annoying kids and ghetto 20-somethings come to this theater and talk all through the movie. My biggest pet peeve that has gotten WAY out of control is people who have to check their cell phones or have texting conversations during the middle of the movie. To me, the bright, glowing phone screens are so distracting. These problems seem to be more prevalent at this theater than any other. Bottom line: Try another Harkins.

I'm in love with this place. They have the best salads, and they are HUGE! Even when you get the soup and salad (great tomato soup!), the "side salad" is still huge! It's a little pricey for salads, but I think it's worth it. It's the only place I know where the "build your own salad" comes with seven topping options, and they don't charge extra for avocado. I've never tried the pizza or sandwiches, but they look great, and back when I used to eat chicken, I thought their pesto chicken (on my salad) was really good. Enjoy!

Hands down the best yogurt shop in the valley. I've tried several, and this one is awesome. They have the freshest toppings, and their tart flavor is delicious. My husband swears that both their chocolate and their vanilla are better than any of the competition. One question though: Why the tip jar? Do you tip at Baskin Robbins (where they actually scoop your ice cream for you) or at any other place where all they do is take your money?? I don't get it, but I love the yogurt! Oh yeah, one more thing: Beware their giant bowls. It's really easy to get carried away, and with the weight of toppings and all, (at 39 cents per ounce) we generally end up spending about $8 for two.

It pains me to write a negative review of PJ, but I just have to ...  I was so excited for the new location to open because my husband and I go to the Indian School location any time we're down that way, and this is way closer to home. We were impressed by all the room up there! Not cramped like the other locations. Unfortunately, the food was not nearly as good! Both of our meals were not nearly as good as we've had before (at the other locations).  Also, our service was terrible. We asked another server if ours was new, but nope: She'd bee there since it opened a couple months ago. She forgot jalapeno our hummus appetizer (to their credit, they brought it out after our meal and gave it to us for free, but it was bland and not that good). She charged me for a side of tahini, even though it was supposed to come with my veggie burger, and she never refilled our drinks.  Overall, this was a very disappointing PJ experience. I'll try again one more time, but if it doesn't improve, I won't be going back to this North Valley location. :(
