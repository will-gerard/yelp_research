Just a tip...if you're going with kids in the heat, pack bathing suits and towels and hit up one of the splash pads area.

Always a fun visit....typically for the Lunar New Year celebration, but also for the Full Moon festival in Autumn any time is good to visit...great year round shopping and Asian market.

Not so clean, both the facility and the workers.  This place has been here forever and they do make a good toasted sub.  They should, they were doing it long before toasting was an option at most chain sub shops.  If you can get past the cleanliness, the food is not bad...although I do wonder about the hygiene practices in the back where they make the subs.

Nello's Pizza in Ahwatukee....sometimes very crowded, but always worth the wait.  I cannot speak for the rest of the menu, but I can say that any kind of pizza you order here is going to be excellent.  We have been enjoying Nello's for years and have never had a bad or questionable pie.  Nello's offers a pretty good selection of beers...and there are usually a couple of rotating taps that pour local craft favorites.  The atmosphere is typically bustling, oftentimes loud inside during rush hours...which is probably why we enjoy coming here when we are dining with our kids.  I'd definitely recommend Nello's and often bring out of town visitors in for a pie.  It's close by too, which is an added convenience.

Lee Lee's Oriental Supermarket is something you really have to experience.  Anything and everything you have experienced in  Asian cooking or dining is sold at Lee Lee's.  From fresh(live) seafood in the tanks that line the back of the store, to dining and cooking utensils, to beer and wine.  It's almost as interesting to just browse the isle as it is exciting to go shopping here.  You must see this place to believe it and to comprehend the extensive variety of items for sale.

Rocks, minerals and crystals...this place has them all.  Additionally, there's a giant selection of hand crafted, folk art, crafts, and musical instruments from around the world.  Oh, and there is a ginormous assortment of bulk incense in towards the back of the shop...great prices!

I have used this location on and off for the past several years due to it's proximity to my house, and I have consistently received generally rude service with no regard whatsoever for your time.  Avoid this location at all costs!  Appointments, made to minimize the amount of time spent waiting can take over 2 hours!!!  The most recent encounter here has convinced me to never come back.  I asked my wife to take my truck down to get a tire plugged.  (I paid for road hazard service on the last set of 4, BFG AT Radials)  I had been in a week ago, but since I didn't have two hours to spend for an 'appointment', I had the service guy check the tires and set the air pressure all the way around.  So my wife goes in there with the truck less than a week after....not only is the problem with a different tire this time, it is now un-repairable and must be replaced.  Rather than just put the spare on so I could deal with the situation they convince my wife that she needs to buy a new tire.  Oh...and the same BFG tire model that I have been buying  for my vehicles for years apparently isn't being made anymore, so I now have an oddball third tire on my truck.  I hope the years of patronage was worth the underhanded sale of that one tire by the sales rep...because from here on out, I will find another location, if not another business all together, for my tire needs.

Hands down, the best gym we've belonged to.  From rock climbing to indoor or outdoor swimming, water slides for the kids, both indoors and out...a resort-like atmosphere at the outdoor pool during the summer.  Wet and dry saunas, basketball, squash, tennis...this place really has it all.  Have never even come close to having to wait for a piece of cardio equipment.  A fairly large free-weight area, decent sized machine area keep wait times to a minimum as well.  Typically this place is pretty clean and neat.  As with any public gym though, there are individuals who don't follow basic cleanliness etiquette, but the staff here does a fairly good job of keeping that at bay.  I've heard others complaining about the price, but I have been a member of many, many gyms in the past, this place is definitely worth the cost.

I hate to do this as I have been a gold level member here since 2006 and typically I have nothing but good things to say about this place.  Had tonight been my first visit to this gym though, it likely could have been the last.  Taking into consideration that there is some major construction going on here, so much so that they plan to shut the doors for spring break, with nothing to offer for consolation...but that's beside the point, not the reason I felt the need to write a review tonight.  I go to the gym late typically, to avoid the prime time crowds, so by the time I get there happy hour is long past.  Tonight was no different, as far as the crowd.  What was different were the dirty towels...EVERYWHERE!  I went to three different lockers to find one that was empty, there were dirty towels in the lockers, all over the locker room, out around the pool area, in and around the dry sauna...literally everywhere.    I hate to bitch about this too much because it's not the staff who leaves towels all over the place, if people would have just a little bit of courtesy to clean up after their own selves, this wouldn't be an issue.  But I pay for a membership and expect the place to be kept clean.  Beyond the towels and the general messiness of the gym tonight, there was no soap in any of the dispensers...that is just unsanitary and unsatisfactory. Oh yeah, and a staff hanging out in the locker room by the big screen just watching tv.  I saw him hanging out there on my way in though, if I had seen him on the way out I probably would have told him to get to work.  I understand and appreciate the fact that there are improvements underway at the gym, and that some of the amenities may be limited or not available for a while, but that's no excuse to let the place get all dirty and leave old dirty towels all over the place.  I was very disappointed tonight.

Sacred ground for Arizona craft beer lovers.  The food is good and what you would expect.  Beer choices, both draught and bottles is typically phenomenal.  If you've never been, you can't lose...and if you have been, you already know.

One stop home brew shopping for the Tempe/East Valley area.  These guys have been in the business for over 20 years and can answer any questions you might have.  A great selection of equipment, as well as plenty of recipes and ingredients on hand, make this the only place you need to go for your home brewing needs.

I have seen so many awesome musical acts at this place I cannot even count.  Sadly the Sail Inn is closing down this summer(2014), so this review probably won't do a whole lot of good.  This place is(was) a Tempe icon, and I am definitely bummed to see it go.  Sail Inn has both indoor and outdoor stages and when fireworks are going off at Tempe Town Lake or Sundevil Stadium, you can't find a better spot to have a beer and watch the spectacle.  With two stages, Sail Inn was ideal for mini-festivals....many a reggae shows blessed their stages.  I can't even remember how many times I've watched Tempe's Godfather of Reggae, Walt Richardson laying down some funky reggae at the Sail Inn, then sat and enjoyed a beer with the local legend afterwards.  The closing of the Sail Inn in Tempe is going to create a vacuum that I cannot see any other venue in the area filling any time soon.

A great bottle shop in Tempe area, situated right next door to their own tasting room.  Top's is oftentimes better priced that even the big chains like Total Wine.  Some of the staff could use some customer service training, but overall it's a good place to find less common beers for sale in the downtown Tempe area, and worth the effort if you have to go out of your way to get there.

Hungry Howie's....good, cheap pizza.  Yeah it's not fancy wood baked pizza, but for the price, you can't beat it.  Always good coupon deals around too.  I'd rank Hungry Howie's above Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's..any of the big chain, econo-pizza joints.  From this location, I've always had really good service.

Brought a groups of my kid's friends here for a birthday party.  It's in a good location for such an occasion, as we had lunch and played some games at Dave & Buster's beforehand.  The theater is clean and nice.  A large number of screens.  Probably one of the better choices for mall-located movie theaters compared to say Arizona Mills Mall or Chandler Fashion Center.

Best movie deal in town!  Pollack Tempe Cinemas, home of $3 movies and $2 Tuesdays.  No, they aren't first run movies, but they aren't that far off either.  For the prices, this place cannot be beat.  In my opinion, the concessions at Pollack Theater are even better than the larger movie complexes....the popcorn is always hot and fresh and you will end up spending about half or better of what you are used to at other theaters.  If you happened to miss a movie by a couple weeks at other theaters, check the Pollack show times because you can often catch it there.

A great venue to bring the kids, have some fun playing games, and even enjoying a couple drinks. We love it.  Prices are fair, games are good...the atmosphere is loud, so never a problem bringing very young kids.  Located at Tempe Marketplace, its a great bargaining chip when trying to shop with your kids.

A favorite of ours for family dining.  Rumbi Island Grill has a tasty menu, and reasonable prices.  The service sometimes seems to be hit or miss, but overall it's pretty good.  We frequent this place when we are dining with our three kids as there is always something for everyone.  Mac & Cheese for the youngest, cheese burgers for the teen, and tasty bowls and salads for parents.  Can't beat the music playlist, always some good roots reggae playing!

Of the three Red Robin locations nearby, this one is probably the least clean, and the least consistent as far as service goes.  It is the closest to home though, but we often opt for Tempe Market Place or the Red Robin out at Chandler Fashion Mall.

This place is awesome.  As a beer enthusiast I am very impressed.  Isles and isles of beer, from local craft brewers to old German breweries.  One of the coolest things about beer shopping here are the rating cards from The Beer Advocate on the shelves next to the selections....very useful and helpful.

Hillside Spot is a pleasant little neighborhood cafe in Ahwatukee.  We have made a couple stops here at various times of the day and have been able to sample the fare and the atmosphere during both a Sunday morning breakfast rush, and a week night dinner rush.   The breakfast burrito with chorizo was very good, as was the carne asada torta I had at our dinnertime visit.  I look forward to return visits to explore more of their menu.  As an added bonus... There is a nice little variety of fine craft beers in the cooler up front.  Be sure to take a look at what's available before you are seated.  Oh, and the seating...there is both indoor and patio seating.  The patio is large and centered around a good sized fireplace...a great location to enjoy a nice craft brew in the evening, next to the fire...only in the months of December and January though when weather temperatures permit.  I'd definitely recommend this place if you are in the area.

I've found another great reason to stop by on Thursday nights!  Thursday nights are craft beer night at Hillside Spot, $2.50 off all craft beers, bottles and draft.  It just so happens that this place has a pretty good selection of bottles, as well as a few good beers on draught.  The food has always been great here, we stop here often for lunch over the weekends, and have never been disappointed.  With this added little bonus of craft beer night specials...you can't go wrong!

There are two main reasons why I frequent  Hillside Spot in Ahwatukee.  One, because it is close to home.  And two, because is the closest location to my house that regularly carries a fairly decent choice of craft beers in my neighborhood.  I've enjoyed bringing my family here, meeting friends here for craft beer nights, even conducting a few casual business meetings here.  The atmosphere is nice, the food is pretty good, but the reason I am revising my review has nothing to do with the food or the atmosphere, but more to do with the service and management.  A couple weeks ago we stopped in for dinner after and evening event.  On the way out, I stopped to look at the cooler and found a couple of bombers that I thought I would take home.  One of the things I would always tell people about this place was the excellent deals offered on carry out beers.  For $8.95 you can build your own 6-pack of 12oz cans/bottles, or you can choose two bombers for the same  price, as long as you are carrying it out of the restaurant.  So, I take to two bombers to the register and a few minutes later some snarky little wannabe hipster comes to ring me up.  The first words from his mouth was that he could not sell me this one particular bomber for that price because it was a more expensive brew than the others.   I asked why they would have that beer in the same cooler with the other $8.95 bottles...but was pretty much blown off.  I mentioned that it's not really appropriate to advertise one price on the shelf and then charge another at the register....again, just a rude, non-response.  So this past Friday night we stopped in again for dinner.  Again, I stopped at the cooler on the way out and found two beers to take home, thinking they must have surely fixed the issue from last time.  To my disappointment, the same snarky, hipster wannabe comes out and rudely proceeds with his spew.  I asked if he was the beer buyer for the establishment he affirmed adding that he was also an assistant manager for the place, but he was not there in that capacity on that night.   Again, I asked him as a manager, if he thought it was ok to have beers being advertised for one price in the cooler, but then telling customers, 'not that one' when they bring up their choices.  Again, I got a rude non-answer.  Today I would like to retract my previous reviews.  I would also like to warn any of my craft beer friends from the area who may stop by this place based on my previous recommendation.  After the rudeness I experienced here on Friday night, we will find another close-by local spot with good beers.  Perhaps Tukee's.

So badly, do I want to give these guys five stars. And each time I visit I am hopeful for a better experience.  Unfortunately, this place has consistently poor service.  Long waits for food, incorrectly taken orders and generally inattentive servers are just a few of the problems.    What continues to frustrate me more than anything is the beer cooler in the front of the store, and the borderline dishonest pricing advertised.   Above the cooler on a chalk board they advertise two of the bombers to go for $8.99*.  Select bottles do not apply.  But they don't label the prices!  You don't find out that both bombers you chose were exempt from the deal until you are making the purchase.  I've mentioned this frustration  to the staff in the past, only to be rudely spoken down to by someone claiming to be an assistant manager and one of the beer buyers.  If this place wasn't just a couple blocks from my home I would have never returned after my initial bad experience.  But they are close and convenient, and at certain times they are the only alternative to fast food in the immediate area.  Their food has been pretty good for the most part....I just wish they could get their service and their craft beer issues solved so I can start recommending this place to friends again.

The worst Subway sandwich I've ever had.  It's a 12" sandwich, how difficult can it be?  It practically exploded once the wrapper was opened. Eating it was next to impossible.  Tonight was the second consecutive experience like this...won't be back for a third disappointment.

Take your time...it's not Sea World, you will run out of things to see and do if you rush!  This is another great venue to visit in the summer, when it is too hot to take the little kids outside.  You will be surprised to find this kind of place in a shopping mall.  There are tons of fish and other sea creatures to see, there is an area where people can actually touch some sea stars, sea urchins and occasionally some other crustaceans.  SEA LIFE has a shark tube, or a glass tube where you can walk through the shark tank, much like the one at Sea World, California, only a little smaller.  There is a play area and a souvenir shop near the end.

What a cool little bar.  The beer selection is pretty good, always rotating new craft beers into the lineup.  Haven't had the opportunity to try the food at  Flanny's just yet, but from others, I hear it is great.  The staff is very friendly and pretty beer savvy, if you are a craft beer enthusiast you will appreciate this.  In fact, if you are a craft beer enthusiast, you will be quite surprised and pleased when you walk into this establishment...from it's unassuming appearance on the outside, you wouldn't expect this place to play host to some fairly exciting beer events.

You can never go wrong at Flanny's.  Definitely one of the better selections of craft beer on tap in the east valley.  They also do growler fills and they have a limited, but good bottle selection to go.    The food here is consistently good.  Everything I have tried on the menu is fresh and tasty...I would suggest the southwest egg rolls!  During the day, Flanny's is family friendly and there is a kids menu for the little ones.  Service is great when there isn't a beer event going on.  Typically, every third Thursday night there is a tap takeover of some sort, and depending on the popularity of the highlighted beers, it's not uncommon to find this place packed to capacity.  Service is as good as you can expect when there is an event though and the bar is three deep in beer geeks.  Family owned and operated, this is a great neighborhood pub!  I highly recommend it to anyone who cares about the beer they drink...and anyone else just looking for a cool little spot with good food on the east side.

Great beer, great pizza, and great atmosphere at  the Tempe/ASU location.  One of the first pizza places we found when searching for gluten-free pizza.  Try any of the pizzas, the meatballs or salads and you won't be disappointed...check out the bar and be sure to inquire about the rotating taps to see what's on the menu.  Located on Mill Ave, on the edge of the ASU campus, this place can become quite crowded at peak times and during events held in downtown Tempe.  Indoor and patio seating is available.  Recommended

We stopped in early on a Saturday morning, 11-ish, both of our younger kids in tow.  The weather was  very nice so we decided to dine on the patio.  The atmosphere on the patio was pleasant, and we had great service, even sitting outside.    Our server was friendly and very helpful.  The food came in a timely manner, and was quite tasty.  I ordered the IPA-battered fish and chips to accompany the double chocolate porter from Four Peaks brewery...neither the beer or the food were disappointing.  I often order fish and chips at similar establishments, and I have to say the plate was on the high end of the scale here, I'd definitely recommend it.  I can't speak for the nightlife here, nor the dining experience inside, though I did go in  to have a look around.  The bar and dining area seemed spacious, there are lots of long tables in addition to two-seat tables and larger booths.  It was dark, as you would expect from a traditional pub, and I imagine when the weather here in the valley is hot, this place would make a nice oasis.  Our overall experience here was great, we definitely plan to return.  I would recommend this place to others, and would suggest if you are going to bring kids, sit outside.  The price was good too.  For one of the more higher end eating/drinking establishments at Tempe Marketplace it was very reasonably priced.  Oh yes, and with 53 beers on tap...many from local brewers, I would definitely recommend this place to fellow beer enthusiasts!

My wife and my three boys took me to O.H.S.O. for a pre-Father's Day dinner, to avoid the crowds on Father's Day.  This place is never disappointing, always with good food, and good beer.  I've been here on many occasions prior to Father's Day weekend so I can attest to the consistency of O.H.S.O. as far as food, beer and service.  Located right off of a major canal in Phoenix, O.H.S.O. is easily accessible by bicycle...and many cyclists do frequent.  Another unique feature is the dog friendly patio, out back.  On any given afternoon, you will find the patio occupied by K9's and their companions....there are even complimentary homemade treats for the quadrupeds made from spent grains from the brewing process.  Oh, and if you have the inclination to brew your own O.H.S.O. offers a program where just about anybody can come in and brew, using their equipment and facilities for storage while your beer conditions for a couple weeks.  If you like beer...real beer.....good craft beer brewed locally, O.H.S.O. is your place!

Other than the usual Arizona heat, this outdoor beer festival is one of the best I've been to in the Phoenix area.  Great local representation, as well as awesome craft beer from across the country and around the world.  If you are a beer-fest fan or a craft beer fan living near Phoenix, this is one of the events you want to plan to attend.  But it's hot!!!  Pack water....I utilize a Camelback Mule Pack to bring enough water to keep me well hydrated on such excursions.

The Ameri-Can Canned Beer Fest is shaping up to be one of the best craft beer events in the valley.  With the addition of live, local music like Catfish Mustache and Dry River Yacht Club and a larger offering of food vendors this beer fest that encircles the Scottsdale Civic Complex becomes more of an event.  Not that over 250 different canned beer offerings aren't enough to come out for!   I have to give a special shout out to The Draft Sports Grill at 1130 W. Grove Ave in Mesa...thanks for the free sliders and wings, they hit the spot!  The Ameri-Can fest is a great event to get out to try some of our great local brewers, most of them are pouring there, as well as brewery offerings from across the country provided by our local Arizona beer distributors and select local venues.   http://cannedcraftbeerfest.com/

It does seem a bit strange to be drinking in the back corner of a supermarket, but nonetheless it was an enjoyable experience. The Watering Hole is a bar inside the Whole Foods Market in Chandler.  I came for a beer event, Pitcher of Nectar Distributing had the owner and head brewer from Ass Kisser Ales on hand and they were hosting a sample tasting of their more popular beers.    Yeah, the place did seem a little overwhelming because of the crowd, but I thought the staff handled it very well and were quick on their feet.  It took me less than 5 minute to get a drink because I went to the bar and ordered it, I didn't sit on my ass and wait for service.  I had a chance to talk to the bartender a bit on this Friday night, he was friendly and seemed to know what he was talking about when it came to craft beer. He was really enjoying the event I believe.  I had never been in this store prior to this event, but I feel motivated to go back for a closer look....at the market and at the rest of the beer list at the bar.

My first visit was for an Odell Brewing Company tap-takeover event during Arizona Beer Week.  The place was crowded with fellow beer enthusiasts.   Even with the crowd, service was good...our waitress was knowledgeable and helpful in making  selections.  Prices were fair, but not a cheap place to drink...though they offer samples of anything you'd like to try.

Stone Brewing Arrogant Tap Appropriation during American Craft Beer Week 2013...do I really need to say more?  The selection of Stone brews at this all day event was dizzying.  I was very surprised that we were able to find some seats...but fortunately we managed, without too much hassle.  Our server was really good, very friendly and helpful.    I continue to love this place and recommend it to anyone who loves good beer and to those who could use a little help in their beer selection...it was pretty amusing, we were there for the Stone Brewing event last night and at the table next to us, this guy orders a Corona...pretty funny to watch the faces at the tables surrounding him when the server brought it out to him.

NB Taekwondo is hands down, the best Olympic Style Taekwondo school in the valley.  The dojang was founded and is operated by Masters Tony & Jonny Nguyen, two world class athletes with a history of  International and Olympic competition, and a lifetime of martial arts involvement.    The school has a family/community feel and a respectful, yet competitive environment.   Classes are organized and active, students don't have much down time or standing around waiting.  Both Tony and Jonny posses excellent skills in working with the kids as well as adult students, and are great role models.  The school is family run and you will often find Mrs. Nguyen, Tony & Jonny's mother, greeting students and working behind the front desk.  She is always a great point of information if you have any questions about the school, schedule, upcoming events, etc.  We moved to Arizona several years ago from Southern California where our oldest son was involved in a similar World Taekwondo Federation School that we were very happy with.  After arriving in Arizona we tried many schools before we found the school Tony and Jonny were training at.  After our younger sons were old enough to begin, we followed the two brothers to their new home, NB Taekwondo.  I would recommend this school to anyone looking for a top-notch, well balanced, competitive martial arts program.

TechShop.  Have you heard of it?  If not, I encourage you to check it out.  We are fortunate to have one of only nine TechShops in operation across the country here in Chandler, but more are coming.  What is TechShop?  It is a membership-based workshop that provides training and access to what is likely millions of dollars worth of "builder-type" equipment.  From wood working to metal working, plastic injection molding, carbon-fiber prototyping, 3D scanning/printing to industrial grade sewing machines, laser cutting and etching, robotics workshops, both hardware and software...This place has it all!    Additionally, TechShop offers seminars and open houses, art and music events, collaboration parities, inventor workshops and much more.  As a veteran, I took advantage of a complimentary one year membership with about $350.00 worth of free classes...and after taking a few classes over the past couple weeks, I am ready to pay for the full membership once mine expires.  If you're a vet, you should at least go down and check out what they have to offer.  The facility itself is very nice.  Clean and hospitable, I have never had trouble finding help with anything or any questions there.  Complimentary popcorn and coffee are provided at all times to help fuel late night building sessions.  There is a community feel to this place, and collaboration is highly encouraged.  Many awesome projects are shared on their website and  Facebook page, setting fire to your own imagination as you begin to realize the possibilities.  I'm sure there is much I am omitting, so go to TechShop in Chandler or check them out online.  If you like to build things or tinker, or hack...I think you will really love this place.

Recently refurbished and under new management!  Took my 4 and 9 year old boys early this morning to get some exercise while beating this monsoon heat and humidity...they had a blast and came home worn out, just as I'd hoped.  Never visited the original place that was originally designed by Disney Imagineers, so I cannot really compare....but this place blows away any Chuck E. Cheese or similar venues.  Though under new ownership Makutu's still has somewhat of a Disney feel to it.  It's very well designed and cleverly decorated inside.    In addition to the climbing trees that lead to what seems like endless tubes for kids to explore, the zip line and the banana slide were the kids favorite.  Makutu's has a decent sized cafeteria, clean and bright.  There is a video arcade with ticket dispensing games and prizes to be earned by winning tickets.  Kids and their parents are identified with a wrist band upon entering, and cannot leave the facility without being checked out by the front desk staff...who, by the way, were as friendly and upbeat as all the staff members I observed here.  Makutu's is open for kids parties and has a separate area to accommodate this.  Apparently there are free kids yoga classes in the afternoon, and I saw a sign on their theater area that indicates that there may be music, dance and drama activities going on at some point, as well.  Overall, I would highly recommend Makutu's Island, especially for children under 10 or 11.  It's a great place for the kids to run around and burn some energy without getting heat stroke...for parents, there are plenty of places to sit and relax while the kids play.

July 19th, 2014 - Tempe Center for the Arts  This was the inaugural Real, Wild and Woody Beer Festival, organized by the Arizona Craft Brewers Guild and held at the Tempe Center for the Arts.  This amazing event showcased some of Arizona's finest craft brewers who offered a vast array of specialty cask and barrel-aged beers, as well as some wild beers, representing the progressive brewing scene that is alive and thriving in Arizona.  Many of the special offerings available at this event were made exclusively for this special event.    Beer festivals in Arizona, in the middle of summer...might not sound appealing given the often 100 degree-plus temperatures this time of the year.  The Real, Wild and Woody event was held inside the cool, air conditioned confines of the Tempe Center for the Arts, setting the event apart from other local festivals such as the Strong Beer Festival held during Arizona Beer Week in February.  This event definitely has the potential to be the premier craft beer festival in the greater Phoenix/Tempe area.  I would highly recommend it to any craft beer lover!  Great job to Rob Fulmer and the Arizona Craft Brewers Guild!

It started out as a great idea for an otherwise lazy Sunday morning...let's hit up Paz for lunch.  I've been here a couple times with my grad school cohort during happy hour, and have had a light sample of the menu offerings...but never with the family, during typical eating hours, rather than typical drinking hours.  We were seated quickly and everything seemed like it was going to happen...the place was pretty packed, and there was a very large party seated on the patio across from us, so I do realize there were valid reasons for the wait staff to seem a bit flustered and rushed.  That, I can understand, and deal with...even when I'm hungry and expecting a bit more expedient delivery...what I can't deal with is watching parties who were seated  10 minutes after me getting their drinks first, then their appetizers and finally their meal.  I think they were on their fourth round of mimosas before I could get the waiter to bring me a fresh beer!    So as this was unfolding before my very eyes, I'm already reforming my opinion of this place, and it isn't very nice.  Three times we had to ask the waiter to bring water refills for our kids, they were drinking water because there were no other choices besides soda or alcoholic drinks.  Anyway....the food finally came, and it was as expected...excellent.  Pretty much everything on the menu at Paz is hand made, fresh...the tortillas, the guacamole, the frijoles..all of it.  You would be hard pressed to find a more authentic, home cooked-feeling, Mexican restaurant.  Seriously, the beans and tortillas take me back to my childhood, sitting in my best friend's kitchen as his mom stuffed us to the gills with the same, authentic, feel-good food.  Back to the service.  I ordered the Fayuca Shrimp Burrito....so amazingly tasty.  However, I was nearly ready for a new beer when the plate arrived....and as I had feared, mid-burrito, I ran out of beverage.  This was a major bummer.  I asked politely, more than twice for the beer I had ordered....but when I watched my late coming neighbor's getting their 4th mimosa refill as I sit there waiting for my second beer, I could not help myself but to ask for the manager.  The manager/owner came over to our table and we explained the frustration with our experience.  He was cool, tried to explain the reason for the less than stellar performance...and before the meal was done, he came back with a revised check, discounting our drinks....which we didn't ask for...so that was nice.  I was sitting there thinking how I always seem to only write reviews because a place I visit is something less than I expected...but by the time I left, I was glad that the owner came out and offered his assistance...the food at Paz is unmatched, and the atmosphere is nice...kinda hipster, but nice...with all that going for it, I suppose that it is possible we just happened in at an unfortunate time.  Because the owner took the time, and made the effort, I will gladly give this place another chance.

Glad to have a Fate location closer to the east valley!  Always a great beer selection, good food and friendly service.  Fate South is at a great location with an awesome patio and outdoor seating area...definitely a fan!

Good shop, good prices on parts and tools.  Great proximity to the trails at South Mountain, in case you need a part in a pinch.
