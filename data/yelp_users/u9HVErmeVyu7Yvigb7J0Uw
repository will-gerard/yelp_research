Don't bother with this place.  I had never been here, my husband and I decided to pick up some food to take home.  We ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, an assorted tempura appetizer, a lobster appetizer, and yakisoba.  When we got home the order was totally wrong. Instead of lobster we were given mussels (which were gross), instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2... that's right only 2 shrimp in the whole mix.  The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great, pretty bland.  I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi, but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw.  Never going back, such a complete disappointment.

I love coming here. It is my favorite place for a casual day date. I'm not usually a fan of hefeweizen but they have the best I've tried.  I am personally a big fan of their sunspot gold ale.  They have the tastiest burgers in AZ, my favorite is the one loaded with swiss and mushrooms. The buns are awesome too.  I think the greatest thing they serve has to be the jalape√±o caesar salad. Either ordered as the main dish with chicken, or as a side salad. Yum. Love this place, I am annoyed it took me so long to find it. Never had any issues with service, sometimes a little slow but not bad enough for me to lower the rating.
