Hello my name's Faith and I'm addicted to burgers.... I ventured into this place once before... scatter brained as always we ordered a french press to help clear things up.... mmmmhh yesss... felt good. Then a Mexican Coffee... bought back some memories and tasted balanced. This time I had to get lunch in order and I lucked out going around 4pm. ... not  much of a hustle and bustle. I sat with my Wide Eye and soy  and came upon a burger that called my name..... ARROGANT BASTARD BURGER.... I did it and it was as big as my hand but they don't over load u with fries or whatever sides.... who needs it? just a pickle and ur prayers.      Taste was amazing and sauce was silly good... I was laughing and left proud and looking forward to writing this. When I think of burgers this will be one of top three in AZ.

I love this place.... needs a little upgrade outside  but fun everywhere else.... I swear every time I come here i try something different to eat and drink.... but I always forget to check in.... I enjoy the Fillet tacos.. I get them with no cheese... they put alot....Mini Burgers are always spot on. . Chips and salsa don't have alot of flavor.. Prickly pear Margarita is the fall back when beer is outta the question. Tortilla soup is a no-go late night snack... It's never as good as in the day. Awesome happy hour and OPEN TILL 2AM... WITH FOOD. Really cool servers and bartenders. Come here if you need a BIG bat cave to hide in for a cool down.

I haven't anything here that didn't upset my carnivorous stomach... which makes me sad cause I love to explore all kinds of food. That's the ONLY reason the rating is so low. I loved the Po boy they have and enjoyed their drink station and vibe. I like that local artist are welcome to sell and post their work and it all fits. I tried the steak and mushroom sandwich and hated it... forcing it down with a really good iced coffee. Can't really mod the coffee at all but it was good and I hope I will find something that I love.

I love this place, the service at the bar is always amazing and no matter what day it is there's always people buzzing around! I had some disappointing crab cakes that put a bad taste in my mouth, even though they say homemade I tasted something that was caught in a aqua duct. On the plus side I love the calamari rings and LOVE THE OYSTER ROCKEFELLER, great group fun, and soooo fresh! I've done lunch here and I had the meatloaf that was on spec that day and was in love, the flavor and complementing mash potatoes and veggies were a perfect match and I'm glad I listened to my bartender. I couldn't decide because I was hungover and this meatloaf and a Harp did the trick. Hippie sandwich is also on the top of my list and will always be my go-to meal at Casey Moore's.        Patios are open and have enough room for a larger group to meet and outdoor bar that is always open during the night, serious door people though, so don't forget your ID. I hear there's live music sometimes but I have never been. Great surrounding area, great local shops and walking distance to Mill Ave.

I lost myself in this amazing place. I love order in a place that has everything and A Mad Hatter's Antiques & collectibles gives that to everyone who ventures out that way. I happened upon it after work and I was looking for a little time to relax. Walking through the aisles was fun and a crazy top floor that houses rented booths to artist and consignment wares keeps things interesting.      Reasonably priced and, from what I've heard, restocked consistently. On top of everything the staff was sooooo great to everyone that came in: From the Pickers and diggers, to the mom / daughter combos that came in, to someone like me who loves to find interesting things everywhere and anywhere. I hunted for about an hour and a half and had an intense look on my face for the most part but I was never followed around or bothered.... Which I've experienced in other shop that are similar... and that was refreshing opening for me because I never at one point really knew what I was looking for but I was able to find things that I hope I never have to part with.  Worth the time and effort to get to Glendale and you'll love the area.

I love that this place has top seafood plates and choices. The services is hit and miss but once i went in with three friends and we sat at the sushi bar and they saw we weren't getting service they grabbed our order right away. Happy hour is good and drinks aren't expensive anyhow so drinkers celebrate! Cherry roll (i do it without sauce), octopus, anything with their eels, i love the quality of salmon as well. The best part is that FOOD IS SERVED TILL 2AM!!

If you have never been here THEN GET YOURSELF THERE NOW!!! parking is weird and very busy street but I would throw my truck in the middle of the street just to eat here. Not Dirt cheap but not at all pricey, and service is awesome!! Went with pastor and Carne asada tacos! chips and salsa were awesome too! Sad THAT ISN'T ANY RICE!! BUT GREAT BEANS! Then we grabbed one of America's corns to go...  awwww everything was awesome! the sweet taste of the Pastor was sooooo perfect. PASTOR FOR LIFE!!! AND there is a cool squirrel outside that they have yet to name!!!!

Great service and amazing seared Ahi tuna tacos. My group and i were 15 deep and everyone had a drink and were even able to buy our celebration shots instantly. Our server Blake suggested to my buddy and I that the Ahi tacos were really good and we went for it, thankfully, we were just gonna have some burger sliders... The sauce and freshness surprised me, just enough seasoning to complement the texture.
