I've been here twice and the food is great, prices are very reasonable and the service is fast. They have mobile ordering and delivery advertised as well. BBQ pork fried rice for the win!

The food here is amazing, the California club and AZ burro are popular and for good reason. I came on a weekday morning so it's not as busy as on the weekends. The building is very small and primarily a drive thru ordering system with about a dozen seats inside and another dozen outside. Not sure that I would wait in a line for 20 minutes for a burrito or sandwich but overall the food is excellent, healthy, and there's a good variety of hot and cold beverages.

Dan removed and replaced the very light tint on our 2012 Camry with a darker more Arizona friendly tint. During the install there was a small tear in the vinyl by one of the windows, Dan made some calls and had this small spot (about the size of tic tac, pretty small) repaired for us, you can't even tell that there was ever a small spot that was repaired. The tint came out looking great and has been very helpful in keeping the car cooler on these 115Â°+ days. Definitely recommend seeing Dan for your window tinting needs.

This morning I chose the green chili with grits and an egg, it was delicious. My wife had the chicken and waffles which I stole a bite of and it was also delicious. We came around 8 on a Saturday and there weren't many patrons here, by the time We left the place had filled up but it didn't look like more than a 5-10 minute wait time.

I saw Superior Window Tintings ad online for $69 tint. I have an old beater that is a daily driver but it doesn't have any tint so I figured for $69 how could I go wrong, even if it starts to peel or bubble after a year it's not bad at $69. I called and spoke with Linda and made arrangements to have someone come out to my home the next day at 4:30 - 5 pm and was told that there was an additional trip fee but the total would be $100 for any shade including the window stripe. The next day came and went, I was at home waiting for the tinter to show up and nothing. I tried calling and texting Linda with no answer. I left a voicemail and no call was returned. I began to do a search online to see if there was a home office or anywhere that I could call to see what was going on and found that this is a home based business and the only number associated is the cell phone. I called the following day and left another voicemail with no answer. Update: today is 5 days after the no show and I called back from a different number and Linda magically answered. When I told her who I was and that the tech did not show up nor call she said "I think they got into a car accident that day, let me check and see what's on the schedule and I will call you back". No call was returned, based on my experience with this business I would not recommend using them because if their business is operated in this way what does that say about their product? I would recommend Dans Window Tinting, he is fast and does a great job!

I can't say enough positive things about my experience with Dr. Jacobsen and his team at Starfire. From the moment I walked into the office I was treated like a valued guest rather than just another guy with a cavity.  Dr. Jacobsen took time to explain what was actually happening and made a recommendation for a treatment plan. He has a very warm personality and is not heavy handed like some other dentists I've used before.  I required a crown replacement and Dr. Jacobsen has a machine that makes the crown in a few minutes. It's so awesome that I didn't have to use a temporary crown while one was made and shipped out. It saved me another trip to the office and was an exact fit for my bite.  Thank you Dr. Jacobsen. You are far and away the best dentist I have ever visited and will always come back to your office!

Great place to get some rest, the restaurant is not that great but is ran separately from the hotel. The hotel staff are very friendly, the room was clean and there's a coup free bottles of water in the rooms. Couldn't ask for more in a comfortable hotel stay. We have stayed here twice and both experiences were great.

Melissa did my eyebrows pre wedding, it was my first time having my brows waxed and they looked great after. My wife has her brows waxed by Melissa on the reg. and they always look great. I'll keep coming back to "man up" on my brows, Melissa really does a great job. No more brow shaving for me!!!!

I heard about fast movers from a friend of the owner Ali. We were given a special rate which was negotiated via text message to move our items from Gilbert to Scottsdale. The next day the two movers arrived, one of them had no experience as a mover and expressed that it was his first day.  All of the items were located in the garage and about 70%of things were boxed with the rest being furniture and odd shaped items like a space heater. The 2 young guys showed up promptly and began to load the truck. When loading furniture they did not use moving blankets. When asked they said they weren't using them because of the special rate we were receiving, I called and text messaged the office and then the boys began using moving blankets.  It's important to note that everything in the garage had been moved 3 days earlier in a 26 foot uhaul truck with room to spare. As the boys were about 2/3 loaded they began to leave a large void in the middle of the truck and remarked that a second trip would need to be made. I contacted he office to inform them that the truck was very poorly packed and sent pictures of the massive amount of open space and unsecured load. I was told that they boys would unpack the truck and reload it to ensure it would all fit in one run however by the time to office was able to get a hold of the boys they were already on their way with a loosely loaded truck up to our Scottsdale Home. I met the boys at the house and they asked for a payment of $300+ prior to unloading, I called my friend who knew the owner and he came over promptly and the boys began to unload the truck, after they had freed up some space they left again with the truck partially loaded to pick up the remaining items that should have been in the truck on the first run. They returned and continued to unload the truck. As they were unloading we began taking pictures of all of the damaged items. A brief summary of the damage was as follows: Boxes smashed and contents crushed, light weight boxes were placed on the bottom and heavy boxes were placed on top of them.  Boxes were ripped by the movers Dolly's Plastic moving buns were broken and debris was hidden in a closet.  50" Tv screen was cracked The BBQ grill wheel was cracked and the side burner was bent.  Some heavy duty bins were part of the move and they have yellow lids, the yellow lids were stepped on and had shoe prints along with broken items inside from the compression.  The drawer lock rail on a craftsman tool chest was bent and had to be bent back in in order to be removed from the chest, the chest also had paint worn and scratched off of the side and back, the tools and drawers were all mixed from the chest being tipped or laid on its back.  My wife has one prize piece, a pottery barn white linen entertainment center, we are not wealthy and this was her baby, when the boys loaded and unloaded it they placed other items in top of it without protection and left black stains on multiple parts of the cabinet, there were also black shoe prints on it. When asked about the cabinet one of the movers said he didn't do it but the other said yes he did.  They broke the door to a bedroom with a dolly and we are finding more and more broken items as we go through the aftermath from their carelessness.  I offered to pay the boys in cash for their time at the rate they told me they were paid $12 & $9 per hour minus the travel time for them having to make a second trip because they didn't load correctly in the first place. I was told no, you can work it out with Omar. I reached out to one of the owners (Omar) about the damage and asked how I would be compensated for everything and was told that I declined the insurance which when offered by the boys at the time of moving would have changed the agreed upon rate of the move. The other owner Ali  then asked my wife via text message when I would be paying him since he doesn't work for free I had offered to pay the boys that day but was declined and have not received any invoice from this company. I asked about compensation for damages and was told that I would be sued. I have never had a bad experience with a moving company until I met with Fast Movers. The primary issue is that neither of the movers were actual movers and had no idea what needed to be done, I can't really blame the boys for not being trained on how to move things as that was due to negligence on the part of Ali and Omar who operate Fast Movers LLC,but many of the damages that occurred were from lack of common sense, I.e. Heavy boxes go on the bottom and light boxes go on top ( everything was staged in the garage heavy on bottom light on top). I would love to have a reasonable outcome from the thousands in damage that were caused by Fast Movers and will update this review accordingly. Update: Ali was scheduled to meet with me to review damages and come to a resolution, he would not meet unless I removed this review first, i delined and the day of the meeting he backed out.
