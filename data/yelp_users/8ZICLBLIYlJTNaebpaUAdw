Neds has always been one of my favorites. I went to high school nearby and we always stopped here for lunch. Now whenever I'm back in Mesa it's on my list of places to go. It's location is not the best but the tables are always full and there are always families. This sub place is much better than any of the chains nearby. If you haven't been you need to try it!

I used to come here all the time because: -they have tons of color choices -there plenty of technicians so there's almost always an opening -the prices are pretty good  -it's clean  Today my experience was less than satisfying. -the front desk girl had no idea what she was doing -my nail technician was rude, rough, and made me bleed multiple times after I asked her nicely to be careful -my manicure was rushed and even after being asked to round them out, my nails turned out uneven shapes  I don't normally leave negative reviews, and I used to love this place, but I am glad I found a new nail salon after my experience today.

First time visit and they did a wonderful  job. Went after work so I almost ran into closing time but not quite! They weren't pushy but we're efficient and I could tell they were ready to close even though there was another woman there with me. My gel manicure was $30 which is normal for this area and my basic pedicure was $23. They had a nice selection of colors, and told me that they had just gotten some new ones! I will definitely come back here now that I've found a new place near me!!

This place was great! They got all 4 of us in right away, were super nice and fun to talk to, and the place was very clean. Will definitely be going back!

Had a great experience the first time, the second couple times not so much. They rushed through  my manicure and are too concerned with their yelp reviews. The more you ask me to leave a review, the less likely it is to be a good one.   Someone also responded to my review at another nail place scolding me for not going back to Nu Nails when I said I would in my review. I assume it was either the owner or someone who works there on their personal yelp account. Not a good look.
