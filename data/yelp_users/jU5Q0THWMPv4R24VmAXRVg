I would never try to deal with this company again.  I have some friends that used them and they suggested that we check them out.  I don't think I will take any of their advice ever again!  Darin at the Scottsdale store is an awful salesman.  My wife and I went to the shop and told him what we were interested in.  We even know what floor we wanted.  How easy right!  We left him my number so that he could call us with some pricing info once he got it from Shaw.  After about a week I left him a VM because I figured he had lost my number or something.  No call back from my VM.  After about 2 weeks I called the store and Tim answered the call and put Tim on.  He told me he would call me back in 20 minutes with the info.  Lol. About 4 hours later he called and I was driving so I asked him to email me the info.  I have since called him several times and left messages and replied to his email.  Holley shit what an easy sale I would have been.  Maybe he does not want to deal with my little 350 sq ft room.  I can tell you they will never get any of my business in the future.

I play in a league here every Tuesday, and I love it.  It gets me out off the house and I get to hang with my friends and play some pool and knock a few back.  The tables are good, the bar staff is friendly, but they do go through servers rather quickly.  As soon as a server knows your drink order they are gone :(  All in all I really like my Tuesday nights at Clicks.

I can say that my wife and I are regulars here.  We are not the kind of people that walk in and are like hi Norm, but we do eat here about once a week to every other week.  The food is always good, and the staff is always friendly and good at what they do.  The few times that we have had issues they have always been taken care of.  The portions are generous and I feel it is the best bang for the buck when it comes to sushi in Scottsdale.  I do eat at a few other sushi places in town, but this is my fave.

Marty just left my house. He did a great job installing the fence!  He was a pleasure to work with. When he came out to quote the job I could tell that he is very passionate about what he does and it shows in his work. I like his saying about little ones. Don't trust them and don't underestimate them!  I won't.  If you are in the market for a pool fence I highly recommend Marty.

F@(& this place.  I called several times today to check in on a phone order that should have been delivered a few days ago.  The 1st time I called the kid who picked up the phone was a rude little prick and he put me on hold never to come back.  I then called several more times only to have their answering machine pick up.  I finally got someone on the phone and they tell me that they have no idea when the phone will be there which is really messed up because it has been paid for, and when it was ordered they told me the date it would be shipped and the date I would get it.  What gives?  Never use this place!  They should have their contract canceled.  Its little sh!tty stores like this that make Verizon customers switch to other carriers.

I just called again to see what the new word is and I was told that their ordering system is broken and that I should keep calling in.  I was also told that he thinks the phone will ship around the 28th.  I ordered it on the 3rd, and was told it would be there on the 11th. I also responded to a Retention Manager that replied to my first post, but she did not return my call.  Go figure.  Go figure that this store only has 1 star ratings.

So my buddy called me to let me know that his car broke down and he was having it towed to the shop that he and his brother have been going to for a long time.  I am talking like 10 years.  And yes the shop I am referring to is Airpark Auto Service.  He text me to let me know that this place quoted him $1300 to do his water pump, thermostat, and coolant expansion tank. When I read his text I instantly thought that they were trying to screw him. Here is why. On his car if the water pump or thermostat were bad the coolant expansion tank would be fine and if the tank broke the other parts would be ok.  I told him that he should not have them do anything to his car and that I could do it all in an hour or two.  Keep in mind that I have replaced his water pump and thermostat in the past.  It is a very easy job on his car.    He called the shop when they 1st opened to tell them not to do anything to his car, and that is when they flat out lied to him.  He was told that his car had already been disassembled.  Well, I work in the airpark (at an insurance company) and told my friend to meet me there and that I would look at it.  We met there at 8:00 and went into the garage with his service writer and a tech was "working" on his car.  It was not disassembled beyond taking off two plastic panels, one under the car which is only held on by a few screws and the other which is right under the hood when you open it.  I would say that it might take someone with no mechanical skills about 5 minutes to take those off and that is being generous.    So let me recap that lie.  He was told that they had already taken everything apart and started working on the car.  That was not true!  When we all walked up to the car my friend asked the tech that was standing there how he came to the conclusion that the thermostat, water pump and coolant tank were all needing to be replaced.  The tech told him that he looked at them with a flashlight.  That kind of made me laugh (on the inside).  The thermostat is in a thermostat housing and the tech does not have x ray vision and the water pump is behind the fan clutch/fan blades, and then the water pump pulley.  Another thing that would be hard to diagnose unless the shaft that goes through the water pump broke.  It was not broken at all.  The 1st thing I did was spin the fan blades and it was smooth as can be which let me know that the water pump was probably OK.  I then looked at the coolant expansion tank which was blown up.  There was a huge crack down the side of it and the top was 75% blown off.  Well there is your answer as to what was wrong.  It was his tank and nothing more.    At this point my friend had them stop what they were doing and had the car towed to my house.  I had my friend pick up a new coolant expansion tank and bring it over.  Well, I changed out the tank, and put an ac belt on his car and it is back on the road.  The moral of this story is to NOT TRUST Airpark Auto Service, and NEVER go there.  And even if they did want to change all 3 parts they quoted him they should not charge anywhere around that much.  I don't care how long the "book" says it will take. Stay away from this place.

Read "previous review" first.    Several years ago I had the pleasure of meeting and listening to Scott Waddle.  He was a Commander in the U.S. Navy and the captain of the USS Greeneville.  While Scott was in control of the submarine he hit a ship from Japan that had high school kids and crew on it.  Lots of them died.  Google it if you want.  Why am I writing this you might ask.  Good question.  I am writing this to explain how important it is to take responsibility for your actions.  That is what Scott did and he now does speaking engagements to try to get people to do the same thing (take responsibility for your actions).  As a business owner you have to take responsibility for not only your own actions but those of your employees too.  I am happy to say that the owner of Airpark Auto Service did this (kind of).    I told my friend that he needed to speak with the owner so that he could get everything off his chest.  Seeing how he had been going there for a long time he could only think about all the other times he had probably been ripped off.  Well, he had a meeting with the owner and they had a conversation about what happened, and she took responsibility for the actions of her employees and told my friend that they were in the wrong.  She refunded my friend the money that they charged him and I hope she had a long conversation with her employees.  I am guessing that she was pissed that her employees were caught red handed, but who knows.  If it were me I would have lost trust in all the employees involved and fired them!  But lets be honest, this is something lots of shops do;  They take advantage of people.  Here my friend had been a loyal customer for a long time and was about to get ripped off by a shop that he emphatically trusted and referred people to.  I guess all this means is that I am glad that the owner of Airpark Auto Service took responsibility for the actions of her employees but I still would not trust this shop!  Once trust is lost it is very hard to get back!  Almost impossible.

In an old review of a restaurant I wrote about how people will go to the same place to eat over and over and then when something bad happens they are quick to come on here and write a bad review about it.  Well this is similar to a review like that.  Here is why.  I'll start with a little background.  I have been coming to this dealership since Rick Hatch owed it, and to me it feels like the same place now that it is under new ownership.  I am sure that will change once the new gigantic dealership is built.  I have enjoyed the rides, parties, bikes, and beers and and everything that goes along with being loyal to a dealership.  Today that has changed.  I decided to get my bike dyno tuned because I have some friends who have the same size engine (88) that I do and they leave me in the dust when we ride.  My bike has pipes (not performance pipes) and a SE air filter and a SE Race Tuner.  I uploaded several stock maps to see what felt best and I decided to really maximize the performance of my bike I needed to have it dyno tuned.  And it would be nice to keep up when everyone takes off at a light.  When my bike was on the dyno the rear tire fell apart.  It was a ME880 and the ones made in Brazil have been known to have problems.  It was a newer tire with a ton of rubber left on it.  When I went to the dealership to see what happened Jeff the tech that was doing the dyno told me that he had the bike going 120 MPH when he started getting hit with rubber.  I didn't know my bike could go that fast.  Anyway they took no responsibility for the tire.  They told me that it was from Brazil and that they stopped making that tire there because of situations like this.  I am aware of this so I was not too pissed.  Well my bike kind of needed a new tire since I couldn't ride it.  If I could have I would have went to Moto Tire and got a new one for less then $200 all said and done.  I talked to a different Jeff who is a service manager and he said that he would hook me up with the install.  He also told me that if I only replaced the rear that I would have miss matched treads and it would ride like shit.  So I told them to do the front too.  The dealership is running a special and it is advertised that if you buy a rear tire you get the front for free and installation is $75.  I will post a picture of it.  When I went to pick my bike up they did not hook me up at all and I was getting the same deal as anyone that walks in off the street.  Jeff told me that he was going to help me out with the install and shook my hand on that. So his word means nothing! I was shocked to be handed a bill of 860 something dollars.  Here I was thinking they would take care of me a little bit because they destroyed my tire when it was on their machine.  Kyle the "service consultant" who gave me the bill called Jeff to come deal with me.  Jeff told me that he did hook me up.  No he didn't.  He now tells me that the deal that is advertised to everyone is what he can do for me.  After talking with him for a while he realized that I was never given a quote from Kyle (Jeff said, "they live and die by their quotes".) probably because he thought Jeff was going to take over based on what he said to me and shook on it.  The entire experience fucking sucked.  I was charged $150 for the install of the 2 tires, $25 for "Shop Supplies" on the dyno tune (what supplies were those?), and $15 for "Shop Supplies" on the tire install (what supplies were those?).  Besides a weight to balance the tire and some lube what supplies were used to install a tire?  And I thought dyno tune was all labor.  I guess I am wrong.    Jeff did end up taking $50 off, but big whoop.  My $426 dyno tune turned into $815.01 for 2 tires and a tune.  On the tune I went from 62.20 horse power to 62.40 horse power and 67.74 foot pounds of torque to 70.32.  My air/fuel ratio is better by about the same numbers.  I just got home from riding with some friends which might be why this review sucks (my writing I mean), or it could be that it is 2:30 in the morning, but either way I am not happy with my bill from today.  While I was riding I kept thinking about the entire situation and the way it all went down and I feel screwed.  I do like my new tires and even though the tune didn't change my numbers that much my bike did run a lot better.  There should have been more communication, I should have been given a quote for the tires, they should have contacted Metzeler to get the destroyed tire take care of, they should have not charged me $150 to install the tires, and they should have just been all around cooler.    I hope this helps anyone that is thinking about getting their bike serviced here.  And if anyone from the dealership reads this and wants to contact me, go for it.  I am going to bed!

So 4 stars stands for "Yay! I'm a fan".  I am a fan of this dealership.  I actually just got my bike back from them again.  After I wrote my last review my bike sat for a few days and when I went to ride there was no air in the new rear tire.  It took me a while to find the leak.  It was actually coming from one of the spokes.  I have aftermarket wheels that you can run tubeless tires on.  I was very hesitant to take my bike back to the dealership after what had happened on my last visit.  I called Ride Wright who is the manufacturer of my wheels and they told me that I can either send them my wheel and have them reseal it for 70 bucks or run a tube on it.  I decided to let the guys at HD of Scottsdale take a look at it because they did just install the tire on the wheel that was now leaking.  They told me that it was nothing that they did and that it was leaking because it was an old wheel, but that they were going to take care of me and send it to Ride Wright and have it resealed.  Well, they did send it to Ride Wright and it now has a new seal.  They did me a solid by taking care of that and it is appreciated.  Everybody there was cool today and they even had a Father's Day event going on with free food and drinks and bikini bike washes and stuff like that.

If you look at my other reviews you will see I know my stuff when dealing with cars and shops.  I have taken my car here twice to have the alignment done.  They do a great job and make sure everything is all good.  The only time I take one of my cars to a shop is if it is under warranty or if it needs something that I can't do.  Well I don't own and alignment machine!  I have chatted with everyone that works there and they are all good people and easy to get along with, but most importantly they will not rip you off and will do whats right by you and your car.

I felt the need to update my 1st post about KOs. Like I said before I eat there a lot and I like it a lot, so to have given it 3 stars based on 1 bad trip out of many is not fair.   I feel that too many people on Yelp do what I have done. People are creatures of habit and eat at the same place a lot. No body remembers the positive things, and are too fast to comment about a bad experience.   KOs is A OK in my book. I'll be back soon!

I had a $25 coupon here and man do I wish I would have given it away, or maybe just thrown it away. I remember going here when I was a kid. I used to think all the ties hanging from the celling were so cool. Anyway, this place sucks. Everything we had, had no flavor, was cooked like crap, and just down right sucked. Even the corn was ice cold! How do you mess up corn? So even with the 25 bucks off I still spent around $60 and left very unsatisfied. This is a no go fo sho. If you are in the hood up there and need a good place to eat try Greesewood Flats, or Sassi. I guess I should write reviews on those places.... Maybe one day

I am sad that they took the Mac n Cheese off the menu about a year ago.  If you are going for the 1st time get the cornbread and the chicken and ribs combo.  The peanut slaw is awesome too.  They have a small menu and I have had everything on it and everything is good!  Give it a try.

I am writing this because of how my wife was treated today.  This wash has been around for a long time and I have been in the area since 1994.  I think they opened in 1997.  I only remember that because I tried to work out a deal with the owner that if they detailed my vehicle before a show I would let them advertise.  Anyway, they have gone way down hill and I do not go there anymore.  I go to Danny's Family now a days and you should too.  When my wife went today she had a coupon that was from Money Mailer or ValPak or something.  When she pulled up the ticket writer, you know the slimy wanna be salesman, starts to make several rude comments.  He referred to the coupon as a welfare check.  His f'n job is to up sell and he didn't even try, he just made rude comments.  My wife told me if I was there I probably would have punched him.  I am shocked that she did not get in the car and leave.  She did talk to the manager but it sounds like he just defended the company and his crappy employee.   To sum it up this place has turned into a rundown car wash whose leadership is not very good and they let their employees treat the customers like crap.  If I were to run my business like this I would be out of business.  DON'T GO HERE!

This is the closest McDonald's to my house.  I like to hit it up for breakfast every once in a while.  I also get dessert here when I have a sweet tooth.  I have never had a problem here.  The staff is always friendly.  Even though it is in a gas station it is really nice for a McDonald's.

This is a damn good breakfast spot.  How do they get their omelets so fluffy?  The fresh OJ is awesome, and so is just about everything else I have had there.  I did get sick once after eating here, but I still like it a lot!

I have been to this show several times and it is by far the best show I have ever been to.  If you are looking for something special to do while in Vegas this show should be on your list.  I am also a huge Beatles fan so...

I dig this place.  I like their menu a lot and think the filet sliders are the bomb!  The only thing that I have had and not liked that much was the pad thai.  Everything else has been very tasty.  I think I have tried the majority of the menu.  I also like the bar even though I have only sat at it once.  The service was good and the bartender poured solid drinks.  I hope this helps.

My car was scratched there today.  I asked for the manager and he was less then helpful.  I called the corporate office and was able to get the GM to call the store manager.  The GM is too busy today to check it out but he did tell me that the store manager told him that they didn't do it.  I feel that the scratches were caused by a person and not the equipment and I want them to pull the footage to see.  That shouldn't be too hard!  I will see what happens tomorrow.  The GM said he is going to investigate it.  When I got there the ticket writer was a real piece of work.  He started off with the $4 up-sell to do my tires and I told him no, then he offered it for $2 and I still said no.  Then he told me how details are slow because of the storms and that he can give me a good deal.  The dude would't stop till I started walking away from him.  I got a real bad vibe from the guy.  I would't be surprised if the footage shows him scratching my car.  I know this is a new scratch.  My car was looked at by a body shop 2 weeks ago because someone hit the rear tailgate in a parking lot and left.  The scratches go through the clear coat and paint all the way to the metal.    I will be more then happy to edit my review if Edward (GM) shows me the footage tomorrow when he looks at it and proves that the scratches were not caused there.  UPDATE 7/24/2014 @ 4:58 I just got off the phone with Edward.  I had to call their office to have him call me.  He blew smoke up my ass and told me that he looked into it extensively and that they did not damage my car.  I asked what he did and he said that he interviewed everyone involved in the matter.  I asked him if he looked at the footage and he said no!  How hard would that have been?    I said an employee would not admit to scratching a customer's car.  And I said how would he even know who the ticket writer was.  He told me he knows everyone there and they wouldn't lie to him and that he has no disgruntle employees.  I knew I was not getting anywhere with him so I said something about an INS raid and that was the end of our conversation.  For those of you that do not know they were raided not too long ago.  Here is a link that talks about it.  http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2014/07/24/dannys-car-wash-ice-agreement-abrk/13112765/   Needless to say I will never be going back there.

What I love the most about On The Run Massage is that you get to have a top notch massage in the comfort of your own home.  Its not that I mind getting a massage at a spa or another massage spot, but I hate having to get up and drive myself home.  That makes me go from a relaxed state of mind and body to well.... not one.  Getting a massage at home is the only way to go for me from now on.  If you have never tried it you should give it a shot.

This place is damn good to say the least!  For those of you that don't know this is one of Fox's restaurants.  They know what they are doing.  We had several meats and cheeses and they were all awesome.  We also had the Soft Pretzels and Cheese/Fondue, and it was freaking awesome.  I found myself using the cheese for just about anything.  I know that sounds kind of gross, but it was so good.  Then again I was drinking....  I had the Fish & Chips.  It was good.  I have nothing negative to say about this place.  It is almost worth 5 stars in my mind, but I really need to be blown away, or have something amazing happen during the meal to give the all mighty 5 stars.

The employees in the shop suck. The course is in awful shape. It took an hour to play three holes. I don't think I will ever go back. I had to take off after 9 holes because it took 3 hours to play them. What happened to Stonecreek?

I bought a deal online for a detail from Pit Stop Auto Detailing.  I used it to have my wife's car detailed.  They did a fine job.  It was not over the top detailed, but it was better then what I would have got for the same money from a big car wash like Danny's.  I do think they were very busy with lots of cars to detail because of their online marketing campaign, and that might be why the car was not over the top.  All and all I do like this place and the owner was honest and passionate about his business.

I ate here tonight.  It was good.  I have been here 2 times now.  I went a few years ago during their 1st week in business.  Needless to say it is much better now.  The happy hour menu is very good, and everybody that worked there was friendly and the service was also very good.  I have nothing bad to say.

I went to Cask 63 in the beginning on October.  It was awesome.  My wife had the fish special.  It was a bit pricey but well worth it.  I had the lamb chops that my friend told me about.  He was correct to recommend that dish.  It was awesome.  My Jack and Cokes were great (strong) and my wife had a flight of wine which she liked most of the wines.  Our server was awesome too.  We had several things in common.  My wife thought I was making a new friend.  All and all I have to say this place is very good.

What a Fing bummer.  I have been looking forward to trying this place for a few years and boy was I let down.  I take my kid to Aqua Safe which is a swim school right behind Tom's Thumb Fresh Market and another father in my kid's class was raving about how good the breakfast burritos are.  So while I was getting ready this morning I made sure not to eat much because I was finally going to go try one of these "awesome" burritos.  I ordered the Chorizo Egg & Cheese Burrito and a small drink.  It came out to $10.03 and there is a tip line on the receipt so I left a buck.  So for those of you that are not good at math I spent $11.03 on breakfast.  I am used to breakfast burritos being somewhat hearty.  Not this burrito! It was a SMALL.  I have rolled joints bigger than this thing, I have had sushi rolls that were bigger than it, & ... I think you get the idea.  To top it off there was no cheese.  Come on the burrito has 3 ingredients. 1.  Egg.  2.  Chorizo.  & 3.  Cheese.  After eating a few bites which was half of it because of its size, I asked the girl I ordered from what kind of cheese was in the burrito and she told me they use a 3 cheese blend.  I told her that there was not any cheese and instead of looking at my food she asked the cook what kind of cheese he put in it.  She then told me that the cheese is finely grated and that is why I didn't see it.  Not only did I not see it, I also didn't taste it.  Maybe because it was not there.    If you are in the area of this place and looking for a good spot to eat breakfast try Over Easy which is in the same building as the Ice Den.  The burritos there are about 4 times the size and maybe about the same price.  Come to think of it I should write a review for Over Easy!  Much more bang for the buck.  11 bucks for a burrito and a small drink is way too much for what I got.  The food cost on everything I had was probably less than 1 dollar.  a few pennies for the soda and cup, an egg, and some ground up chorizo.  I feel so ripped off!

My mom went with me to my little guy's swim class yesterday and afterwards we went to Tom's Thumb to give it another try.  Everyone was friendly and the food was much better this time around.  Actually I would say the quality of the food was the same but the portion was much better/bigger.  I look forward to going at night to try the BBQ.

What can I say about Pei Wei.  I am kinda pissed that they moved from Fountain Hills to the new location.  The old location was closer to my house.  The new building is very nice though, and it was designed for speed.  They have lots of people working, and lots of registers.  The food at all Pei Wei locations is the same as far as I know.  I really like their food and the concept.

So I was in Vegas on business and my client took me to eat here (at the Vegas location).  It was awesome!  When I got back to AZ i Googled them to find a location close to me.  Well there are none that are really close to me, but I went out of my way to eat here and show this place to my wife.  For some reason it was not as good as the location in Vegas but it was still very good. Whenever I am in their neck of the woods I will hit it up.

I have been around this town for a while and I have watched it change.  The night life has changed a lot in the last few years!  I feel like an old guy when I talk about it. Ex. Do you remember driving up Pima before the 101 was here type of stuff.  Anyway, Maya is without a doubt the baddest club Arizona has to offer.  There is no if ands or buts about it.  I have partied all over the US and internationally and Maya could actually be in a city like Miami or LA, but its not.  Its here in Scottsdale, AZ.  I think if more clubs like Maya were to open in Scottsdale it would put Arizona on the nightlife map.  I don't really know if that map exists or not!  Someone should make one.  Maya is large, has several bars that are located in good locations in the club, has a very good looking staff, and is a great place for a night out.  They also focus on bringing in big name DJs which is awesome if you are into EDM (Electronic dance music).  I have yet to get a table here and pop some bottles.  Maybe for the next big party we will start our night here!

There are a lot of burger places in Scottsdale and this is my fave.  They make everything from the burgers to the buns.  The ordering system is strange and I am not sure who to tip but besides that this place is the shiznit.

Some people like pickles and some people don't.  I hate pickles!  The smell and taste are just awful to me.  I went with my wife and kiddo and we ordered a bunch of food.  I got the burger that is on the happy hour menu and I asked for it with no pickles.  Shocker I know.  Well it had pickles on it.  Usually I will just take them off and it will be okay but these pickles must have been in some very potent pickle juice because all i could taste was pickle.  Needless to say I didn't eat it.  I tried to give some to my little guy (toddler) but he didn't want it.  He was content with mac & cheese, pretzels, and chicken strips.  When the server, Carley, finally came around to check on us (she took are order and never came back) I told her we needed the check and I asked her if she put "no pickles" on the order.  She said she did, and she saw the pickles sitting right there.  She said she would ask the manager what she could do.  It turns out nothing what the answer!  How do you mess up someones order and then not take care of it.  They didn't take it off the bill, or offer to make me a new one, or a dessert or anything.
