Amazing and honest. This is a true quality business. It's hard to find a great mechanic and that's exactly what Robert is- a true mechanic.

This has to be the slowest Starbucks drive thru I've ever been in! And the people in the drive thru act like they should keep an entire cars length between them and the car in front of them. This ice tea better be amazing for the 15 mins I just spent in the line.

The drive thru is beyond slow. It took 10 mins to order and now I'm sitting behind a car waiting to pay for another 10 minutes and unfortunately the gentleman at the window didn't even apologize for the ridiculous wait.

The drive thru, if there is a line, is the slowest one ever. I've been sitting behind one car for 10 mins and he has sent the canister 4 times and he is still not done. I mean go inside if your transaction is that long.

I love the salads at Rubios. Low calorie delicious eats keep me coming back for more! The service was really great but the floors were a little dirty. Overall, I enjoy going to this restaurant.

The service is always poor. The credit card machine was down but the hostess failed to tell us. When we were waiting to put our names on the list the hostess sat at least four parties before even making eye contact with us. Too bad because the food is delicious.

The ice machine and the ability to keep the soda machine cold was broken yet they didn't tell me when I purchased a drink. I think that is sneaky. Lukewarm soda is gross, especially for someone who doesn't drink soda often. I was hoping for a treat. Boo to chipotle.
