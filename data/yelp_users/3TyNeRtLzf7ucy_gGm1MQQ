Been in twice. Usually busy so they get you in and out quick. Had nails and brow wax done. Nails lasted for weeks!

Terrible service. Clueless at the baby registry counter and rude manager, Mike that smokes cigarets out front of the store.  Wish I could give them 0 stars. Pretty sure they ordered the wrong chair and then lied to me and never put it on my registry like I asked. I'm going to another location to try and figure out the mess this dumb place got me into.. Too much stress for being 7 months pregnant. :(
