Waitress and atmosphere are good. I got chicken fajita, and it was cold...usually my fajitas sizzle on my plate, it was barely warm to touch. And was very bland and flavorless. Wouldn't come back or recommend it to anyone :/

We came an hour before close and were told the pickles were already put away for the night. They should close an hour earlier then!!! Waitress seemed distressed and over worked, however there were only 3 people in the restaurant. And my Reuben was nothing but fat and end pieces, was gross. I couldn't even eat it, and didn't. It looked like people's leftovers they threw on my sandwich. My mothers liver was overlooked too, tastes like rubber. We went to in n out on our way home from dinner to get something to eat. Very disappointed because this used to a regular place for us.

Food is amazing - authentic French food! You can choose to dine inside, dine outside for some Kierland people watching, or they have a private patio lit with lights and candles for a more romantic setting.

WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!! STAY AWAY!!! I should have known I was in for a bad haircut when we went back to shampoo my hair, and the girl put shampoo on my head before she put water... fast forward to the haircut, she had NO experience and NO idea what she was doing. I tried being patient, and gave her an easy task - trim 1inch off my hair straight all the way around, and a layer an inch above that all the way around, and trim bangs around face. My hair was no longer one lenght...and my front longest layer was the same length as my back top layer...????? I was scared for her to do anymore damage, and told her I was not happy, to just blow dry - I had already paid because I had purchased it on livingsocialdeals. She asked if I would like someone with more experience to come fix it, and I said I would appreciate that. The 2nd girl comes with an attitude telling me it looks good, etc. I finally just got up and said "thank you", and grabbed my purse to leave. She looks at me and says "you can either be a brat and have an attitude, or you can sit down and we can fix it". that is NOT a way to speak with a new customer!!! I walked out of the saloon, called my old hair dresser, and am paying for her to fix the damage later today. Give the groupon to an enemy...although even that is kind of harsh with the quality service and treatment here. Also, store is VERY dirty!! There was hair on my chair from someone else, I was left under dryer 5min after it turned off while my girl was folding towels, etc. VERY POOR!! Would never go back and do NOT recommend!!!

Food was okay, I probably wouldn't come back for it, maybe to try the tacos. We were with a big group, however I've never had worst service. After only ordering 1 drink the entire dinner, with no refills on water, I finally went up to the waitress who was flirting with a group of guys at their table (now I know where she was all night), and I asked her for a glass of wine and out check. No joke, she brought my wine 18 minutes after she dropped off the bill...  Good atmosphere!

Chipotle is always crazy busy, no matter which one you go to. This one always stays stocked up and clean! The quality is always amazing...I've been to some that were hit and miss...  They were in a rush today with a large to go order and added a little too much hot sauce on my salad bowl. I asked if they could take some odd, they did, and gave it to me for free. Wasn't even expecting that! Never had more amazing customer service at any chipotle as I do here, thank you!!!!

Why have so many employees if none of them can help you?!  Also, I came here JUST because I saw something online which showed they had at this location. I called to confirm. I went there, and after FINALLY finding 1 person who actually wanted to work and help me, she said there was only 1 and it was on hold for someone. I said it was probably me, and told her I had called about it, and she said no, it was on hold for an employee and just apologized that they couldn't sell it. WHAT?!....  management might want to look into this...

I come here specifically for the mushroom soup, it's amazing. Although anything here is pretty good, so you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. It's also always clean!  The only reason it lost a star is because the cashier staff are always a little confused...multiple times they rang me wrong, or didn't know what came with the food (bread or no bread?)....after some proper training I would give this place 5 stars, but that needs to be improved. I shouldn't be telling them what comes with my meal and what doesn't....  The manager is awesome, but is also the hardest worker here by observation!

Love this place! Amazing happy hour deals and the freshest sushi in town!!! Every time I come it's a mouth watering success! They have sushi options with no rice!! Also, make sure to try the sahara rainbow roll!! So yummy! And daily specials for a variety for the regulars!   The only complaint I would have is that they make their rolls a little too big to fit in your mouth in one bite.

Just FYI to the employees, not everyone that comes here is drunk. I asked for 2 slices of pizza to go, which is extra. Got charged to go, but the pizza was put on dine in plates. Paid for ranch, but got none. When I told the guy that I paid for the pizza to be to go and for ranch, he just handed me the plate, said sorry, and that e water was free..thanks for my free tap water, however even their machine was broken so I couldn't even get my free tap water.   I'd go to Gus's pizza next door..they don't try to overcharge you for $2!

I wish they had better management, because the food itself is decent.   I used to work close to a different pei Wei and loved it. This one is within walking distance, but after giving it MANY attempts I'm going to drive to the other one, or satisfy my pad thai craving elsewhere.  Never has it been an issue to have sweet and sour sauce with my egg roll, here, they charge you for it. Their fried rice is always white rice poorly fried, so you have globs of white rice and 1/4 fried rice. They don't even put silverwear in your to go bag...this place needs a big management change if it wants to make money at this location, or people will continue to boycott it, or drive to a different pei Wei location 8min away...

They got a star back for the customer service at the corporate office.

Can we please get some better management in here???! Such a shame the pei wei with the worst service is in the best part of Scottsdale!! Stacey helped me today, and she was horrific!! I was waiting in line, and she went to help the last person in line first...don't you help the next person in line?!...I paid, and instead of grabbing my to go order, she starts helping the next person. Can we finish with me and then help the next customer??? I then look at my order to see there's no greens in my pad thai as it should have, so I asked for a side of cilantro since my meal was missing green onions and cilantro...she went back and grabbed it and then embarrassingly told me in front of everyone in the future to order side items when placing my order instead of asking for it when they're busy. I think she may have been the manager, and if so she needs some ethic and management training!!!!!

4 bottles between 5 people...I asked for water and our waitress told me I need to buy it. I need to pay for an $8 water after we dropped so much for 4 bottles at the table? Is Tryst really that money hungry?..I said that's fine, bring us water and I'll pay for it. Water was never brought. In the entire time we were at our table, our waitress came over maybe 4 times. Maybe. We pretty much took care of ourselves while she was busy dancing on stage and in the walkways. Maybe she should apply for a dancer position and tryst should hire legit waitresses....I've been to Vegas several times and this was very poor bottle service.

One of my favorite breakfast spots! I love to sit outside on the patio and just enjoy the morning. On the canal, never had any issues with he staff, and their crab eggs Benedict is delicious. It was over cooked a little the last time I was there, but I'm sure they'll make it perfect next time :)

So good! This place has the best guacamole I have probably ever tasted!! And margaritas!!   I also love the atmosphere and the ducks that hangout outside in the pond. I feed them when the staff isn't looking if I'm sitting outside...don't tell if you see me doing it :-D

One of my favorite restaurants!! Their FREE (and unlimited) pesto dip and bread is amazing, as well as their appetizers and main dishes. The atmosphere is also a plus, with indoor and outdoor patio seating, both of which are cozy.   They also have an outside patio seating area which is first come first serve, however we sometimes prefer that over sitting at the tables because it is more relaxing with comfy patio furniture.  The only reason this place is getting 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because the past 3 times I have been there with girlfriends to grab some happy hour and/or dinner we have had girl waiters who were horrible (not bringing us water, having to ask multiple times for menus and bread, forgetting our food, adding things to the bill at the end which weren't ours, and then giving us attitude when we politely would tell them what we had and what the bill shows doesn't match, etc). We even had one waitress leave for the evening without closing us out, and without having anyone take over!! The busboy took care of us, and that is also to whom we left our tip with. Management needs to work on training their staff better!

This has become a regular spot for us. Always come for pho soup. However beware of to go orders, we got it to go and our raw bloody meat was on top of our noodles, and when we put it into the broth it tasted off so we ended up not eating it and throwing it away. I'll stick to eating at the restaurant from now on when having pho soup cravings.

won't be coming back. They don't do a very good job, no one speaks English, and I have nothing but towel "puff" all over my windows. There's a great car wash just north of the 101 on Scottsdale road! That's where I'm on my way to have them rewash my car.

Meat lovers dream!! They also have amazing potatoes and a salad bar and their bananas and bread are delicious, but be careful not to fill up on throes and save room to try all the meat! Everything tastes amazing!! Great place for Father's Day!  You flip your card to "green", and servers come to you with different kabobs and meat and chicken. When full, or you need a breather, flip your card to red and they won't bother you.   Great service! Make sure to come with an empty stomach, very generous portions!!

I go here regularly for their salmon salads and steak salads, so good!, never have any issues. I had a little situation last time with my food (my half empty lobster and shrimp bisque had no shrimp, and my steak salad came out with cold steak, half the salad drenched with sauce, the other half dry), and I asked our waiter (who was very nice and a good waiter) if he could get a manager over to us. Being a regular, I was curious if they had switched chefs or something since I was having so many issues. She saw my salad, apologized, and brought me back a new fresh one immediately (waiting there the whole time while it was being made). She also took care of our lobster bisque. Great food, and great customer service, gives then 5stars. Every restaurant has an off day here and there, but the way the situation was handled will keep me a regular at this place!

UPDATED: Thank you Richard (deserves 5 stars!) who helped me out after the last guy just left me with his iphone in my hand to speak to customer service to figure it out myself and never came back! Richard answered my questions, and went above and beyond to help me out. Richard gets 5 stars, and should also get a raise, because with his kindness it reminded me of why I had an iphone in the first place, their customer service, and I am convinced to get an iphone 6 when they come out as opposed to switching to a droid.  PRIOR TO UPDATE (1 star, because I have to leave at least 1): It doesn't matter if you make an appt, or if you just show up, you'll be waiting 30min either way regardless. I see employees walking around with note pads waiting to help someone, while I wait because "my appt time hasn't arrived yet", so they'd rather wait for no shows.   Alicia "helped check me in" (I didn't bother making a reservation this time because it hasn't mattered in the past, I still have waited for over 30min), and I told her what I needed (a simple 5min fix). She told me to go home and do it online. I told her I would rather have someone assist me, and she told me it's going to be a 5min wait.  All I needed was to turn off my iMessages because I switched to a droid after my iPhone 5 "sleep" button stopped working and my battery dies in less than 2 hours in airplane mode....simple less than 5min fix, there should be no reason I would have to wait 30min...btw I am writing this on the mac at the apple store...this is how much I am being given attention...

This place is a great place for dinner or a before/after drink. Nice atmosphere and cute date spot or dinner with the girls. Amazing pretzel and cheese app if you're not looking for something healthy!   I'm still a little annoyed I got overcharged on my birthday because of the waitresses mistake when we ordered appetizers, so they lost a star there, especially since I paid and I didn't even get an apology for her messing up, and of course since it was a larger party she automatically gave herself 20% tip. Make sure you tell them EXACTLY what you want, they're not the servers.

Horrible!!!! If you can go to a different pharmacy, do it!! Took 3 weeks for to get me my medication! 3 weeks!!  They always say the didn't get a shipment, doctor didn't do it right, etc. I think they put their worst pharmacists at this location!!!!!   I even had the pharmacist say for one prescription that it's a waste of their money to order my medication since I was getting a small quantity of what I needed, but if I call the doctor and request a higher dose than she will order it for me. Because if not Walgreens will have too much of a supply and will lose money. What?!! Well, they lost money. There is another pharmacy right across the street!!!!!!!

We were staying on the strip, as most people do when they come to Vegas, and we took a little bit of a drive to get to this place because my boyfriends sister wanted it. She said she has to have it every time she's in Vegas, it's that good. At first I thought it was silly, especially with so many great places to eat on the strip, however after taking a bite into my enormous burger, I wanted to eat the whole thing, even thought it was so big I knew it was impossible! Defiantly worth the drive, I now will be joining her here on all trips to Vegas :)  We got the French fries egg (plus whatever toppings it comes with) appetizer and each got a different burger, all were equally delicious!

Very professional from the start, on time for the appointment Saturday morning to take a look at the garage and tell me what was wrong, and what needed to be fixed. I had called other companies, and felt the most comfortable going with A1 Garage Door Service. They seemed most knowledgeable and honest.  The service was fast, best priced in the valley, and my garage works perfectly!  I would recommend A1 Garage Door Service to any family and friend and will defiantly be using them in the future!

** STAY AWAY!!! **  SKETCH COMPANY WITH HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!! I have NO idea how it has such great yelp reviews, except for the fact that EVERYONE CHANGES THEIR BAD RATINGS AND YELP REVIEWS AFTER THEY GET CONTACTED BY THE OWNER AND GET BRIBED TO CHANGE THEIR REVIEW!!! If you read through the reviews, you will see the majority of people have changed their rating after being contacted!!!   The maids first came to my home on September 9, Wed.  They did a HORRIBLE job!!! The property was vacant, but in good condition. It needed some dusting, window cleaning, fridge, etc (ALL WHICH IS EXTRA!).  I was quoted $147 for a deep house cleaning.  Expensive, but I figured they would do a good job.  I was so unsatisfied when I saw my bill come for almost $300!!!!, especially with such a bad service!! $300 FOR A VACANT HOME, AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO VACUUM!!!!!  I got charged extra for 6 closets, yet I only have 4 bedrooms, and they were all empty so all the maids had to do was wipe the top shelf from dust in the closet... I got charged extra for many things, which bothers me because they didn't have anything to clean in the bedrooms besides the fans in 2 of the bedrooms! They didn't even step into one of the bedrooms, because there was nothing to do in there! The ladies were very nice, but the house smelled like a dirty rag when they were done "cleaning", and they used the same rag for the entire house!!! I DON'T EVEN THINK THEY USED CLEANING PRODUCTS, JUST WATER!!! All they had to do was wipe the fans, closets, bathrooms, and kitchen, and mop.  They did not even vacuum because I had the carpets washed.  I called wave to tell them how unsatisfied I was, and she said the manager Jaime would meet me there at noon to look over the place and clean anything needed to be cleaned.  At 11:45am, when I was already halfway to my place, I got a text from wave house cleaning saying Jaime would be there at 12:30.  Thank you for the time change 15min before.  Jaime ended up getting there at 12:45. Keep in mind, this is a Monday so this is during my lunch hour.  I let Jaime in, she said it was horrible, apologized, and got busy cleaning.  I told her I had to go to work, but to call me when she was 20minutes away from being done.  When I returned, the place looked great! Jaime did an awesome job, but it sucked that I had to leave work, AGAIN, to let her out.  That's twice in one day that I wasted my gas and missed work because of Wave house cleaning, with them not even compensating for their redo and my inconvenience.   BE PREPARED TO BE HARRASSED!!! After Jaime left on Monday, I got (1) a phone call (2) text message AND (3) an email from Wave asking for payment.  I would call to make my payment, and no one would ever answer.  Thursday, 3 days since the cleaning, I get a text saying I would be charged fees if I don't pay.  COME ON!!! I called and finally someone answered, and the first thing she does is ask for a credit card. Um, excuse me, can you please tell me what you're going to charge?!!! SUCH A SKETCH COMPANY!! BEWARE AND STAY AWAY!!!

I love this place. Chicken fajita, chicken enchiladas, and tortilla soup are my regular selections. And some fried ice cream if I went running that morning :)  I sometimes call to get it to go on my way home from work, and it's packaged by the time I get there, and always hot when I get home.  Tastes amazing, and is nicely priced. Always clean inside as well!

Salad was good, and the table off someone else's table looked good, but not a good spot for an airport location unless they speed up their service or you have 2 hours to kill. Took 15min just to get a salad with only 4 customers in the place... I'm scared to find out how long it would take on a weekend or for a pizza!   Also bread tasted stale with a weird after taste...and my throat feels a little swollen...   Just FYI, the Sauce locations throughout the valley have always been 5 stars for food and service

This used to be one of my favorite places, but sadly has started to go downhill. The quality of the food, as well as the service, is not what it used to be, and with all the great places going up, it should consider going back to what it used to be if it wants to keep customers, because they just lost a regular. No one likes a watered down drink...I'd rather go to d'lish, make sure to check out that place!!!! :)

If I could give it more stars I would. I come here often for their amazing happy hour with my boyfriend, the food is amazing and the drink prices are very reasonable for the location and atmosphere!  Tonight was exceptionally sweet. After a situation with the valet, the manager brought 11 glasses of champagne for our entire table  to apologize. Totally unexpected and great birthday surprise to our birthday girl. I would not only recommend this place, but would continue to be a regular! :)

With a 1-2 hour wait each time I have been there in the mornings on the weekends, I can not give this place 5 stars. However regardless of the wait, and no reservations by phone accepted, I still continue to keep coming back and waiting because the eggs benedict and pancakes are just that amazing (5 stars!)! We usually put our name in and run and errand or two until we receive a text informing us our table is almost ready. The biltmore and a few shopping stores are right there, so you can do a little shopping to bypass time.

Not a place I would go for dinner, but they have food to eat if you work up an appetite golfing. Great place to practice your swings during the day, and at night it turns into a night life mini golf place with Cosmo lights on the course. They also have bags, jinga, and other great games to play. Their sangria is also amazing!!

Great atmosphere and everything on the menu is unique and amazing!! Service is hit and miss sadly. I've had great service all the times I've dined here, except for last time. I'm going to assume maybe it was an off day and still give them 5 stars since it was always great the previous times. Worth checking out, even if it's just for a before/after cocktail!!

Place is great for watching a game! Great service, food is good, especially for a "bar", and they probably have the Bestfriend Bloody Mary I have ever seen!

I will probably come back here only for a drink of I'm looking for something low key. They have a nice patio with a good vibe. Although I think our table was behind storage or a big freezer or fridge because staff kept going back there and going inside the freezer and I would get breezes of cold air throughout the night making me cold throughout my meal every time they would open the fridge.  I wasn't impressed with my food or my boyfriends. It was ok. Nothing worth coming again for. The chicken tasted off in my salad so I ended up picking it all out and not eating it. Also took over an hour for us to get our food!!!! Our waiter gave us a discount without us even saying anything because he knew it took way too long!!! Especially since I got a salad!  New place, but with some proper tweets and some new dishes from the chef this could be a good spot for a date night or a chill night to grab a drink and dinner with a friend. Great location and patio, move the freezer!!!!
