If I have to give it a star it is only because of their busty waitresses.   This is a miserable place, serving miserable food, with miserably loud music blaring at all hours of the day.  If you can imagine, it's a restaurant in Scottsdale trying to reproduce the worst aspects of places like Cancun. Got it?

I can't hate on this place too much as it was the only non-Starbucks iced coffee I could find while staying in Tempe last week.  Still, the price tag of 2.75 for coffee with ice on the main drag of one of America's biggest college town's seems outrageous.

The Wynn was cool, but I'm a Bellagio guy.   First of all the service was really good, and I loved the intimate feel of the poker room. Our room was huge, but compared to some of the other rooms in town, it felt a little tacky.   3 things I wasn't impressed with:  1. The European pool. It should be called the Sausage Pool. 2. The buffet was good, but not Bellagio good. 3. Like I said, the wallpaper was like I stepped back into 1977.

Funny thing about Phoenix: you never know where you can find a decent bite to eat.  Every year my buddies and I head down for a long weekend of Spring Training and lap dances. This year I decided I'd do some research on restaurants, as we'd been disappointed way too often.  After a long night at the Candy Store we headed to Delux. I was a little nervous about the strip mall location, but then I remembered "this is Phoenix."  We showed up around 11:30 on a Sunday night. The place was packed, but they had a seat for us. The burger was awesome, only overshadowed by the incredible shopping cart of fries.

I'm going two stars. Sorry Dan.  Had our meal ended after the appetizers (and before the "Water Show") I might be inclined to give it five.  As it stands though, the waiter upsold us on entrees we  didn't need, telling us our apps "won't be enough." Not sure what sort of behemoths he thought we were, but clearly he thought we had been without food for weeks.  Then the show started. Wow. That was hideous.

Like so many things in Arizona, this was Whole Foods on steroids. Organic, grass fed steroids, but f-ing steroids.   The place is huge, and I kept wanting to go back and just see what else they had. I never thought I would be susceptible to produce section envy, but comparing it to our local Whole Foods in San Francisco, I just didn't feel ours measures up :(  I had to go back for a second visit to make sure I hadn't dreamt this place up. No, it was real. The plentiful parking was real.  Minus one star, for the very REAL and slow ass coffee bar people.
