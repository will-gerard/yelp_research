Such a wonderful experience. I had forgotten what it was like to do banking on a personal level until I walked through the doors at TruWest. All TruWest employees are extremely welcoming, friendly, and helpful. Geoff, the branch manager, has really gone above and beyond in helping me.  In addition to helping me get an auto loan, he has walked me through every step of purchasing a car (I'm a first time buyer). He's also answered tons and tons and emails, very quickly at that.  It's nice to have your finances in the hands of an institution you can trust to be reliable, helpful, and easily-accessible.

My favorite neighborhood restaurant in Arcadia! My husband and I went here once a week when we lived in Phoenix. The French cuisine is wonderful. I love the pull-apart croissants that they give you while you for your meal, and the Coq Au Vin is my favorite dish. My husband usually goes for the lamb shank and has never been disappointed. The service is friendly and quirky here, too, which I love. A much more relaxed environment from the fine dining room they share a kitchen with -- an environment I much prefer!

SO much fun on a Saturday night. There is such an awesomely diverse crowd here--"cowboys", true-western folk, young pretty girls, old loving couples, 20-something preppy boys, etc. It seems as though everybody comes here for a good time.  The Rusty Spur is pretty small--so be prepared to feel crowded. But if you don't mind that, give it a try--fun music, fun dancing, fun night!!

Because I live within walking distance, I end up eating here frequently--almost every week. Service is usually pretty good, although the last time I went and brought friends our waitress was all over the place and we waited a long time for our food. But hey, 1 out of 10 times or so isn't that bad. Plus, the staff knows the menu pretty well and they make really good recommendations.   The Thai portion of the menu is the best and definitely comes with the most food. I like the Kang Keo Wang: a mix of chicken (you choose which meat) and vegetables in a delicious green curry sauce., and the Chiang Mai Noodles--similar to the Kang Keo Wan but has more of a coconut taste to it. They also let you choose your spice level:1-10. 4 is about the spiciness of a jalapeno. You can also ask them to cut down on the sugar, if you feel like being healthy.

Carlsbad Tavern is a little...different. The food was great, don't get me wrong. The typical "Mexican" portion of their menu was small, but the food off of it was delicious and plentiful. We sat inside instead of out on the patio because it was a cooler night, and I think that that took away from the experience. The outside patio looked awesome. The inside is, again, a little...different. Very much tavern-like, with bat replicas everywhere, and not very Mexican/New Mexican like. A Hoj Poj of a restaurant, if you will.

GREAT American restaurant. Has the atmosphere of a nice steakhouse, but it's menu is much more diverse. Best appetizers: the grilled artichoke and the skillet cornbread, hands down. You get a ton of food with both. I always get the burger, and it's pretty good. The fries are really thin and crispy--so thin that I didn't think I'd like them, but I did. A lot. Their rotisserie chicken is good too--you can see the chicken roasting on the spit through one of the side windows of the restaurant. The only downfall? The water glasses are really really tiny. It isn't a huge deal, but as a big water drinker, I feel bad having my server come to refill my glass 19 times throughout my meal. Good thing the service is so nice!

Although we had heard of Pizzeria Bianco before, my fiance and I were presently surprised to stumble upon it in Heritage Square (we'd gone into Phoenix for first night, never having been before). We'd been warned about the wait, but at a distant glance it didn't seem to busy, so we went on with our night. When we returned, we were welcomed with a 1.5 hour wait which was our fault, really. Luckily the Science Museum, adjacent to Pizzeria Bianco, was open, and we filled that hour and a half quickly. As the time got closer for our wait to end, we went next door to the wine bar, which had a decent, but small, wine and beer list. Prices weren't bad either--beer started at $4, glasses of wine ran around $8-$9.   I loved two things about Pizzeria Bianco: the food and the location.   We opted to sit at the bar instead of waiting longer for a table. We shared (and finished all in one seating) a caprese salad (good, fresh, airy mozzarella), the margherita pizza, and the pizza rosa. I favored the margherita pizza, my fiance favored the pizza rosa. Both had good, chewy thin crust. The pizza rosa was a white pizza; I believe that only the margherita and marinara pizzas off of the menu have red sauce. Anyway, the pistachios on the pizza rosa were an EXCELLENT touch.   Heritage Square is wonderful, especially at night. The layout and buildings are reminiscent of old New England architecture, which is a like a breath of fresh air in adobe-packed Arizona (which I love!). It's definitely a good place to stroll around (which you'll most likely have to do while you're waiting for your pizza :) ).   My advice: expect to wait. They don't take reservations. Even if it doesn't look busy, put your name in. And also, don't expect it to be the best pizza in the world. It's up there, and certainly delicious, but not the best.

One of the best happy hours for food in town. Try the Maui Burger--it's different, excellent, and definitely a steal for $5 (it comes with a good portion of sweet potato fries too). I think that we've sampled everything off of the happy hour menu (which has been so good that we've never found it necessary to go during non-happy hour times) and have always been pleased.

Great little place! Love the atmosphere, good inside and outside eating areas. Good food for inexpensive pricing. I've become a weekend regular!

Deeeelicious. Try the almond snickers gelato--amazing taste and texture. EVERYTHING looked good. Friendly, quick staff. Indoor and outdoor seating. A great spot.

I think that I made the mistake of going into Stax when I was really, really hungry.  All of their burgers are 3oz. And they aren't really priced well--I think that they start around $5. Since it took me about 3 to be satisfied and my date 4, it just wasn't worth it.

One of our favorite neighborhood spots! Great service (generally--there's usually just one server, so you may wait on a busy night), great food, and great beer (and wine) selection. Their pizzas are just ok, as I've found some of the items to be on the menu. But, overall, Side Door is great.

Wonderful, absolutely wonderful. SUCH a great, charming atmosphere. The food was unique and delicious--Chris, the owner/chef, only prepares a select choice of meals per day; we went for breakfast this morning and there were two options. We both had the crostini, which was amazing--grilled pear, goat cheese, arugula, large pieces of toast, oranges, blueberries, and strawberries. Chris even gave me a complimentary glass of Prosecco to give cheer to my recent move to Scottsdale. The pricing was $20/person for breakfast. Well worth it. A great find.

Absolute FAVORITE breakfast spot in Old Town Scottsdale. The food is great, service is wonderful. Try the black forest ham omelet--my favorite thing so far. Every waitress that we've had has been so attentive. Every outrageous request that we've made has been done. If there's a line when you get there, it's worth the wait.

I drive 45 minutes to use Chapman to service my Mazda, even though there's another dealership closer to me, just down the road on Camelback. After multiple encounters with horrid customer service at Camelback Mazda, I decided to try Chapman--and I was happy from the start.   Pete Pabst, the service advisor I have worked with, is great. He made sure that my first repair would be covered by our warranty before they started working on our car, which I really appreciated. I was wary of him trying to up-sell me when he let me know what other repairs our car needed, but he put no sales-type pressure on at all. He made a list of the repairs in order of importance and gave me pricing. When I told him I wasn't too car savvy and needed to go home and talk to my husband, he didn't judge or try to take advantage. The rest of the staff seems just as friendly and helpful. When we got our tires replaced, they explained all of the different options, what they would do, how much they were. In the end, the ones that they recommended the most were actually some of the least expensive tires offered.  Honest and good service...just wish it was closer to home!

Loved it!  It's what you expect - friend chicken and waffles. The menu has all types of different combinations, though, and good side options. I would opt for the chicken breast instead of the thighs or drumsticks, because it's all bone-in chicken and you get the most meat off of a breast. The waffles are good too - they're not too thick, and they have a cinnamon-y flavor to them. I got sides of cornbread and gravy (each $1). And the best part? The drinks (referred to as "jar of drank" on the menu) come in big mason jars.   The service was great, friendly and fast. Prices were good - I think my meal, which was a lot of food and included a drink, was about $15 including tip.

Pleasantly surprised! I live nearby and have been wanting to try this place for a while. The inside atmosphere is nice, but seems a little...confused. It felt as though they had renovated but held onto old chairs, booths, etc. Other than that, though, everything was great. Our server was friendly and made a useful recommendation, which I always appreciate. I had the poached eggs with prosciutto (a.k.a. Eggs Benedict) and a girlfriend had a make-your-own omelet. Both meals were delicious! I'll definitely go back.

Horrible HORRIBLE horrible. If I could write 10,000 ZERO star reviews on this dealership I would.  Why did I go here, despite the two bad reviews? Because they were the only dealership in the valley that had the cars I wanted--or so I thought.   I had been in correspondence with a salesman, Daniel Maria, for about two weeks. We set up an appointment for tonight to look at the two cars we were interested in. I'd been watching the website and talking to Daniel every day for the past two weeks, and the cars were listed.  When I arrived tonight at 7pm for my meeting with Daniel, for which he said he would have the cars waiting out front, he couldn't be found. Another employee tried to find him but couldn't. We finally stumbled upon him and his greeting? "Oh, so sorry. The car you were looking for sold yesterday."  Yesterday? YESTERDAY?! I spoke to him yesterday evening. According to him, yesterday the cars still were on the lot.  The other car? Oh, it didn't exist. They couldn't find it. Wasn't on the lot.  Their excuse? "Daniel is an internet sales guy. They only go off of the webpage." Why would you have somebody working for you that doesn't keep up with your inventory? And why don't you keep the website current with the inventory?  And then they tried to sell me a sedan. I want a hatchback. I know why I want a hatchback. I've looked heavily and know what I want. And then they try to sell me a car that was of a different (and discontinued) make.  STAY AWAY.
