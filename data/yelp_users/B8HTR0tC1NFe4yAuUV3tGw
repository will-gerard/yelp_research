Over the years this place has experienced a sharp decline from a place people used to want to take their kids for birthday parties and dinner after church on Sunday. It now is mostly crowed by those who are just looking for cheap food and a lot of it. Poncho's used to run commercials stating they were an all you can eat buffet but during my last trip I noticed that the eat all you want spirit had been crushed and thrown out the back door with the trash.   Seriously with as much time as it takes for them to see your little flag on the table and to bring you the food item you requested you will lose intrest or just give up and and hit the taco bell drive through on your way home.  The server I had did her best to keep up with the huge level of requests she was being given but seemed tired and mad most of the time. Kind of made me wish I could just go up there and just get what I wanted just so she would not have to. That is the way it used to be and I wish they would go back to that policy but they will not because they know you will eat less that way.   The one thing that would make me even want to step foot in the door would be the basket of chips and salsa they give along with the little pillows of goodness also known as sopapillas that are served with honey. To be honest most kids will still like this place as they do serve food that they like such as tacos and also have a sundae bar with soft serve ice cream and tons of toppings. But if you are like me and do not want to have to suffer for cheap food just skip this place on by.

Case# 25       Food of my childhood  I have been eating these subs since I was a little kid. My mom (R.I.P) used bring me here and it is one of the few childhood memories I hang on to. For those who do not know about this place as the food detective I will share a little background info from my case files to help you out.   Mr. Submarine is actually a small chain that really got it's start here in the valley in the early 80's. At one time the locations stretched from the east valley to west phoenix. With increased competition from larger sub chains ( Subway, Cousins, Blimpy, and Quiznos they were forced to limit their growth and use word of mouth advertising to keep customers coming in. This resulted in store closings and now only two locations remain open. When you try and compare a place like this to say a subway which spends big time money to advertise their five dollar foot long special, or their new breakfast sandwich there is no competition.   This place wins by a mile. Who needs a 5 dollar foot long that is served by some teenager who only cares about his shift ending so he can escape. No, I would rather have the owner there serving me a sandwich that he himself is going to eat for lunch. Don't give me slimy meat and dried out looking cheese. I want soft fresh bread with toppings that enhance the other components of my sandwich not cover it up! OK enough with the ranting, this place is a no frills type of place. No wraps or cookies. They offer the normal meat choices including ham, turkey, tuna and your choice of bread ( white, wheat, and sourdough).  No annoying jingles or sandwich Nazis (read my subway review), just good food, made and served by someone who cares about what they are selling you.  They are open Monday through Friday 10am to 10pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 8pm.  They are a little more pricey than Subway but for a great sandwich and great service it is well worth the price.  Case closed

We ended up here because my friend wanted to eat something less greasy and fried so I said sure why not? Nothing wrong with a little veggie feast every now and again. If you are a veggie lover or a senior looking for a place to eat where it is not crowed then this may be the spot for you. It is true that this and the location in Phoenix I went to suffer from lack of choice issues. It is also one of the main problems I have with this place.  Once we walked in I took a look around and noticed very few people  were actually eating here, in fact the place seemed like it was ready to close down. The price for the lunch buffet is high given the lack of options they offered (four kinds of soup, salad bar, cheese pizza, a few desserts and a rather small bread selection). The bread was not hard but was not fresh either and they even went so far as to cut the bread sticks in half LOL who does that? Can I not have a whole bread stick?  I am sure there are those out there who love this place but I am not one of them. Limited selection along with low quality of food does not make me a happy person or a satisfied customer. I was tempted to ask for my money back but just took it as a lesson learned. Never again!   If you want a good deal I recommend hitting up one of the many other all you can eat places as you get more options for about the same price.

I have to agree with Megan S. as this is one of those rare gems for those who actually are not glued to a television 12 hours a day. This place is a treasure chest of everything from collectible comic books, to rare LP's and hard to find books. I go here at least once a week to checkout their clearance section and have always found a rare gem to add to my collection.    For those who need the over thought conformity of say a Borders or don 't mind tapping into their 401k to pay for that new James Patterson novel at Barnes and Nobel, this place is not for you. There is no trendy little cafe (who needs hot coffee anyways? It is over 100 degrees outside). This is the type of place that reminds you of going to a yard sale and you notice a rare 1st edition of say Harry Potter. The only real downside has to be the music that they play over the speaker system and the low payout they offer for used books and DVD 's.   I brought in over 100 DVD 's and they only offered me 37 dollars (yeah right) so I have to say unless you are just trying to get rid of that wal-mart bargain bin movie you got for x-mas do not bother trading in anything. But if you are like me and enjoy saving money be sure to check this place out.

There are few things in life that make me truly happy. Babies being born, sunny afternoon trips to hang out with a few buddies and maybe the most important one of them all, really good food! The problem with most BBQ places is that there are those who have come to believe that throwing a few pieces of meat on the grill followed by a massive coating of sickly sweet sauce is real BBQ.   Why then would people spend long hours tending smoke filled pits that sometimes look like they came off the back of a old tractor or the family car? Simple because it is NOT REAL BBQ UNLESS IT IS COOKED LOW AND SLOW!!! The smoke is as important as the meat itself when it comes to making lip smacking Q. It not only adds flavor it also adds a nice smoke ring that lets you know that the meat you are stuffing in your face is real BBQ and not some baked in the oven, made at someones mom's house, under flavored mess. I should have known better than go to a place that claimed to be masters of what they call Chicago style BBQ.   First off there is no such thing as anybody with a real taste for BBQ knows there are five main areas or styles. Memphis, Texas, St. Louis, Kansas City, and South Carolina style. Chicago does not even come close to making this list. Each region offers a different take or variation on BBQ and those variations are almost like a calling card that informs others as to the origin of the food they are eating. The food from this place did none of those things. This was my first time visiting this chain restaurant so I went in with eyes and nose open to all they had to offer.   It is no secret that when I walk in to your business that three things must happen in a matter of seconds or I am gone. First off the place should be clean not just look it  (clean floors but disgusting bathrooms). The staff must welcome you or at least acknowledge your presence, and finally the prices should be clearly marked along with the items being offered. As I said this was my first time in this place so I walked in and took a look around. They seem to have really put a little time and effort into creating what they believe is the ideal Q eating establishment. Clippings of newspaper write ups on the company founder, the food and even local charities they help (nice). They even have what I like to call a BBQ battle station.   This consisted of three bottles of their sauce in various stages of flavor and heat levels, malt vinegar for those who enjoy a more vinegar based sauce, and even ketchup for little kids who do not like the BBQ sauce.  Note: the lack of wet naps that are often handed out at BBQ places should have tipped me off to the lack of sauce issue they have. They do offer free drink refills which is nice given that the cups are on the small side for what they charge, I believe it was $1.59 for a small or $1.99 for a large unless you get a combo meal then it comes with your meal.   The prices range from $2.79 for a Vienna Beef Hot Dog to $14.99 for one of their three meat dinner combos. They also serve Italian beef sandwiches ( the reason I ate there in the first place) which tasted OK but the jar peppers they used over powered the meat and made the bread soggy. I also tried the beans and rice which seemed to be just that and nothing more! No salt, pepper, not even a little shot of onion or any flavor enhancer to be found. Their potato salad was on the sweet side as if it had been made with miracle whip or sugar was added either way yuck. I also had a few bites of their pulled pork sandwich which did have a nice amount of meat but REALLY lacked in flavor.   The meat was almost mushy and only had a small splash of sauce. Now normally some places drown their sandwiches in sauce resulting in everything being overpowered with it but any real BBQ master knows that the sauce should only be added to enhance already well prepared meat. It can not make up for over/under cooked, under seasoned meat period!! But this is one of those times I think it could have made the food better. So to sum it all up I would recommend this place to those who are looking for a OK Italian beef place in the Mesa area but as for the BBQ I would suggest you let this little piggy go otherwise you will be the one crying whaa all the way home LOL.

OK so I have been trying to stick to this whole New Years resolution thing which is not easy. But decided to give this place a shot since they offer a few healthy options. Big mistake!!! OK so first off the service was good, and the place was clean except for the area in front of the soda machine. It really needed to be wiped down big time.  I guess my biggest gripe had to be with the food. It was nasty!! Flavorless beans, dry chicken that was closer to jerky and a tortilla that seemed to change colors at the bottom. Not sure why but did not remember paying for a color changing burrito.   Now I understand that this is just a take out place that is very similar to say a taco bell or Del taco, but the food is bad at these places as well. I have to say while the food is bad the service and free refills of horchata did make me at least feel they deserved the one star I gave them, but wish I could have gotten a refund. Sorry but the only person crazy here is me for thinking this place was going to be good.  Never again

This review is just on the food as I did not go to the actual restaurant. I have always heard nothing but good things and they were right! The pizza I had did not disappoint one bit. Thick and chewy crust, flavorful sauce, and lots of toppings this pizza was made with care and left me wanting more.   The overall flavor kind of reminded me of this place we used to have here in the valley called showbiz pizza. It was the place to go before chuck e cheese moved in (the same company just different mascots). While the price is a little more than I normally put out for pizza it does sometimes pay to fork out a little more dough in order to get something great. The overall look of places like these mean very little given they are all part of a chain of restaurants. They usually have the same table, chair, lighting set up with the only real difference being the people who work there. So I will leave that to be discussed by others but if you have never tried this place or it has been a while I suggest giving them another try tonight!

I have been going to this place for almost 5 years now and it has always been good. From the time you walk in and notice the great decorations and the smells of sizzling fajitas. You are greeted by friendly staff people who actually seem happy to see you and then are given a choice of where you would like to sit.   They do offer seating outside on the patio but the inside is best given it is usally over a 100 during the summer time and they always keep it nice and cool. The menu is not very large and features old school Mexican fare such as tacos, burritos, and rice and beans. Now if that was all they offered I would still suggest going there. One of the things that makes this place really great is the fact that they give you Free Fresh chips AND salsa!! How about that??   No over priced stale tortilla chips and jar pace picante sauce, but great tasting free food ( not normally seen hence the reason for the caps). They have a full bar stocked with every kind of mood altering beverage you could want to pour down your throat to chase that extra cheesy mouth full of queso dip you are going to want to order as a starter. Warm with a little bit of spice to give it a little kick it is the best way to get your dinner started right.   If you are really in the mood for a few drinks, some great food for the after work crowd or a nice family style sit and eat some good food type place then this is the spot for you. (NOTE) Make sure to go there during happy hour as the drinks are much cheaper and the SUPER BIG nachos are half off. They also serve breakfast on Sunday if you are looking for a new Sunday breakfast joint.

What can I say that has not already been said about this place? Great prices and a nice selection of fruit and veggies to choose from. I know, how about a short commercial for them for all the great service and products they offer. Hey friends tired of over priced, over ripe, and over hyped produce? Sick of having to eat veggies that require you to mortgage your house just to pay for them? Then my friends come one come all to Superstition Ranch Market.   Here you will find a huge selection of the food you love and can actually afford! ( crowd of people clap and cheer ) Life is hard enough, so quit eating those sour grapes and run, don 't walk to Superstition Ranch Market. Yeah OK I know I have a weird sense of humor but the facts speak for themselves fellow yelpers.  Don' t just take my word for it, check this place out and you will not be disappointed. Just make sure you watch out for those snow birds as half of them are blind.  I recommend wearing a good pair of running shoes just in case.(LOL)

What can I say I still love this place, but have had a few issues with them as of late. Now I understand that there are times of year when things are in season so they will be fresher but they seem to offer a lot of sub-par items. Like the green peppers! Seriously they needed CPR the last four times I was there. But the prices, great customer service and location always keep me coming back. Just hope the people supplying their peppers get it together.

Food from my past (continued)  This is one of those small mom and pop places that has been around for many years yet most people do not know that it even exist. I used to live in the area  when I was a kid and after a trip here recently I find that somethings do not change. The family that owns this place has been cranking out affordable yet great tasting food for three generations now. That is over 30 years experience in a building the size of a bedroom.   With that tradition comes pride in the service, and food they serve. No this is not P.F. Chang's (over rated and not really that good in my opinion) or one of those nasty buffets that make you wish you had just decided to eat at home. No, this is great food the way it is supposed to be. Calling this stuff good would be an understatement. It is more like additive! Not sure of what they put in it but one bite and you will be hooked LOL. Seriously try the shrimp or pork fried rice and you will be going from a pint (their smallest size) to a quart (their largest) of the stuff.   They also serve sweet and sour chicken, egg foo young, three types of soup, egg rolls and Pepsi to drink (sorry no coke products here). Also since this is a small mom and pop place I do not remember them excepting credit or debit cards so bring cash. They are not expensive a $20 should buy more than enough for a family to eat and leave you will a few dollars in your pocket. The thing that makes this place great is that they are family owned meaning that dad is in the back cooking up your order while the oldest son watches and chops the veggies. The mom is still in the front taking orders from customers then yelling them to the back while the younger son does his homework or is told to go and sweep out in front of the store.  With all the chain places popping up these rare gems are becoming harder to find. They represent hard work, dedication, and in my case the past. Support them.  Case Closed

Well it has been about three weeks since I made the choice to visit this shrine to all that is burger, and I wanted to share my experience. I was online looking through reviews for other burger places when I found this place. I noticed that the reviews seemed pretty good so I decided to check it out.   So on a Friday afternoon my buddy and I walked in to this old school looking building searching for what I was hoping was going to be one tasty burger ( think Samuel L. Jackson in pulp fiction) and I was right! The burgers are a nice size given some of the prices (7 bucks for a burger)?    My tasty burger featured American cheese and a well done patty that looked like someone had made it at their house. Large disk shaped patty grilled the way I like it and ready for the several toppings I would choose to add from their topping bar. That 's right they have a section set up where you decide what you want to add to your sandwich. Cool, huh? OK so now that the good stuff has been said let 's get to the bad.   First as the saying goes all that glitters is not gold was talking about this place. From the old looking tables that featured chairs that looked like they where taken from the set of Roseann, to the small and expensive order of fries I received there where some areas that needed improvement asap. The lady taking our order was not the most friendly person you will ever meet and the bar section was to close to the dinning room section so you get the full effect of being a loud drinker without having to pay 4-5 bucks for a beer.   Also some of the decorations looked kind of dusty like they where kept outside during the last dust storm. So if you want good burgers then this is a good place for that. But if you want a cool hangout spot you may want to pop in a DVD of cheers and grab that burger to go.

Man it seems like as of late I have been wanting the things I enjoyed as a kid more and more. 25 cent ice cream from the ice cream man, sleeping in on the weekends, and most of all the food. I have already shared my love of subs from Mr. Submarine but this is another one of those childhood gems.   The burger shoppe is a place that does something many do not know or can never do and that is make a good burger. Yes I know it sounds simple and any old grandma with a frying pan will claim to make a tasty burger but this places does it right every time. No frozen patties here. Just fresh beef being grilled over a real open flame so it has that great taste that makes you not want to stop eating. Large steak fries that not only stand up to oceans of ketchup but are crispy on the outside and fluffy and hot in the middle.  Seriously it just does not get any better! Who says you have to spend a butt load of money just to get a great burger? A large burger, fries, and a drink all for $3.29 not bad right? LOL  Try this place out the next time you are in the area, you won't be sorry!

BABY I AM........... Home???   Wow this place seems so much smaller than I remember it I said to myself as I walked through the doors. Sure there was the small outdated brown booths and view of a check cashing place to look forward to but gone was the original feel and owners of this temple to all things greasy. There seems to be a change in the pricing so the past information on the combo meals needs to be updated as well and there is an added Mexican food menu (to reflect) the neighborhood to look forward to. It has been so long since I have been here I decided to take a quick look around and see if they had kept any of the things that made this place so great. Yes they still make great burgers, need to get that out right now!! Wow why all the anger? It Is because I have to travel all the way to phoenix from the east valley to get a good tasting burger! I mean good meat cooked on a grill, topped with a big pillowy bun. Lettuce that is not brown, tomato slices that are not slimy and onions. The best Jerry the best!! (quote Kenny Banya- Seinfeld  For all the changes I am glad they did keep the food pretty much the same (smaller fries) however the one real change which I wish they would have not have made is the lack of staff. I stood off to the side looking over the menu as others walked in and the front counter guy just kept walking past them. No greeting or even a moment of acknowledgement in some cases. Yes I understand they are very busy but as an employee you should treat all customers as if they are the only ones in the place. People will come to your place to try your food but they will return based on the experience they have. Note to owners/ workers: Take a few minutes to serve up a smile with the plate of fries topped with steak and cheese.

How did I forget to write a review for this place when I first joined yelp? Oh wait I know why, I did not want everyone packing this place resulting in no more delicious food for me LOL. I know I was being selfish but hey even food detectives have their little secrets. I was first introduced to this place back in 2004 by a guy I used to hang out with.   He promised me that nothing but good things would be found in this small and darkly lit place ( kind of got this feeling that I was in the restaurant scene from the godfather and  that I was not going to come out alive LOL). What this place lacks in updated decorations it definitely makes up with it's food.   First off if you have spent most of your life eating those hard as a rock rolls that everyone makes during the holidays you were being done wrong. This place offers bread that is soft, warm, and has a slight sweetness that leaves you wanting more. It is like when you are a kid and you imagine what eating a cloud would be like seriously no joke. It is just plain goodness. As others have stated they do have a one trip to the salad bar rule which they will enforce so make sure to follow it.  This is to make sure that you save room for all the mouth watering food you are about to be served, and served, and served. No that was not a typo or me spacing out and coping the same thing over and over again. This place takes the mother name to heart. Mother is a sweet old women who believes in making sure you eat well and a lot lol. No one leaves this place hungry I can guarantee you that!   Huge portions of ribs, chicken, and even Fred Flintstone dino steaks fill the menu and your stomach until you feel like you are going to bust. Topped off with a glass of sweet tea and you have one of the best meals in the valley. OK so it is out of the way for some and yes it does look like a place that may have been really popular in the 1950-70's but that just means they spend more time making the food taste so good. After all do you go to a restaurant to look at their selection of chairs or to eat LOL.  If nothing else you have to try the pie this place cranks out. If you always wanted to have a grandma who made you cookies but had the one who always bought ones from the store this is your chance to see what you have been missing. I recommend the banana cream pie ( oh wait, on second thought try the other ones banana is my fav). Their pies are creamy, and will make you almost think about packing up and moving closer to this place if you do not already live near by. The point is try this place and make sure you do as the old saying goes "do not judge a book by it's cover or you may miss out on some really good food.  Case closed

Only after years of eating chain type sandwiches could I fully appreciate the quality and size of the sandwiches this place offers. I am a 6 foot 7 man who likes to eat good and cheap. The problem with most places is that they are more focused on the extras such as extra cheese or meat.   Now I have always thought it was a scam to charge for something that you already paid for in the first place (extra cheese on a pizza). But when I go to a place that not only gives me more meat than there is bread I have to say yes!! This made up for all the overpriced, under sized, untasty sandwiches I have had to consume over the years. No more meatballs the size of a marble, or cold cuts that are coated in some kind of weird slime from sitting out to long.   No this place gives you what you order, a sub made of more meat than found in a whole deli counter (lol). I could care less about the cheap chairs or the location of the place, I just always wondered how they made any money with such huge portions at such low prices? The wings are good as everyone else has already stated and the pizza is tasty every time. If you are looking for a up scale place with cloth napkins, and waiters who see you as only a $5 tip then PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS Place!!!   Let those who enjoy good, affordable food come here and feast on common fare. I am sure you will be to busy counting your millions to even make the drive to west Phoenix anyway.

Went here because they were selling ground chuck for $1.99 a pound and wanted to stock up. Did notice the parking lot was packed so I thought it must be OK inside. WRONG! It said they were in the process of renovating the store so I let a few things slide. What really stuck out to me was the fact that the place seemed cluttered and unorganized. The butter was near the beer while the bread was all the way on the other side of the store. Also when the employees stand there and make  loud and nasty comments about customers that should tell you something right there.  I spoke to someone in customer service and they seemed unfazed, like oh well!! I know if someone was talking crap about my grandma I would be taking care of that issue myself. I do not shop at this chain and for good reason. Over priced and the stores always seem to be dirty. I suggest saving your money and going some where they really act like they want your business.

Hey there everyone   In my past review of this great place I wanted to mention the great honey this place has to offer but was not sure just how many types there were. So I went there yesterday and wrote down all the different kinds they offer. They have clover, orange blossom, cats-claw, mesquite, flagstaff wildflower, and Arizona buckwheat wildflower. They are all bottled by the same company located in Flagstaff, AZ. Don't worry if you never heard of some of these types of honey because neither had I until I started shopping here. But along with the huge selection of hot sauces they offer you have to pick up some honey and fresh made peanut butter. Mmmmmm

Ahh the holder of knowlege, the chamber of wisdom, and those sickly popular twilight books. Ladies and gentlemen your local library (half hearted clapping). This location just happens to be down the street from my house so whenever I am able to pry my self off the couch I make a trip to see what it has to offer. First off I have to comment on the hours of operation or better yet the lack there of. Seriously why would a library close early everyday as well as not even open on Sunday or Monday?   I mean come on are we doing so bad in this state that we can not even afford to support a place where people go to seek knowledge and rent the last season of Knight Rider? Will the snow birds have to find a new place to flock other than here and the fruit market? These are questions that need to be answered! OK all joking aside they do have a really nice and helpful staff of people who are great at locating any reading material your little heart desires.   For those who like to check out DVD 's they have a VERY limited selection so you may want to hit the local redbox instead. The thing that is really nice about this location is the very large children section which my niece and nephew love. Plus they host workshops and put on little shows every couple of weeks. It does seem to get a little crowed after 3pm so if you are not into big crowds I would try to get there early.   Overall I would say this library is nice but with limited selections on everything from books, videos, and reference resources I will stick to the Mesa main branch library or even the one located in Apache Junction.

I love good fried chicken. You know that juicy steaming bird that you can not put in your face fast enough?   Well this unfortunately is not it!! I wrote a review a while back about this place and I guess the yelp gods decided to remove it for some reason but oh well. The sad thing is this chain used to be a lot better but seems to be trying to cut corners just to squeeze out a few extra dollars of profit. Little do they realize that people are starting to make or seek out real food.  Speaking of the food here the quality has gone way down. Where they once took pride in what they offered now the focus seems to be on how can we top the double down sandwich? How about replacing dry, over cooked meat that in some cases looked burned and tasted like pure salt?  The biscuits here no longer have that rich butter flavor they used to, instead they were cold and hard like hockey pucks. Seriously is it to much to ask for fresh chicken and food that is hot? I don't think it is. But maybe the coronal just gave up the battle, and moved his troops out of the chicken war. The only problem is we are the ones that have to suffer though nasty fake grilled chicken and brown jello aka gravy.  Not me!! Time to start making my own I guess  R.I.P  KFC

It has been a while since I have written a review so I thought I would share my experince at Midwestern meats. Now I have been trying to stick with my New Year's resolution and lay off the junk food. That means no take out and everything is homemade. So after a really bad experince with meat from Fry's I decided to seek out a store that still had a butcher counter and ground their own meat. Easy right? WRONG!! It is amazing what passes for "fresh" these days!  Sorry your pre frozen chubs do not count and why is the meat gray?? Seriously have these people even seen fresh meat? I have and it did not smell like old dirty mop water lol. Anyways I finally found this place thanks to yelp and decided to do a little research online by visiting their website. Now let me start off by saying their selection is really large. It is like rubbing a t-bone steak and a genie pops out to grant you all your meat filled dreams. Looking for Fred Flintstone bronto steaks? They have them.   Thick cut pork chops? No problem! My selection included a special blend of meat for hamburgers (chuck, sirloin, and beef brisket). The resulting burgers where like a bite of heaven. The meat was brightly colored and stayed juicy on the grill. There is something to be said about doing things the right way and this place does just that. Don't take my word for it, try for yourself and taste the difference. Enough said case closed!!

Over priced on just about everything in stock. Seriously why would I pay almost $6 for a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream? Also the staff can be very rude at times and seem like they do not want to deal with certain people who shop there, kind of made me feel like I was not wanted.    I am always looking for a good bargin but this place has some of the weirdest policies when it comes to their sales. I can not stand when they over price their meat so that they can make it look like you are getting a good deal when they advertise a "sale".   Seriously since when does a pack of pork chops cost almost $15? Or 2 thin little steaks almost $18? All they do is take a pack of meat, mark it up 2 or 3 times the price and say it is buy one get one free. They move more product and still make a good amount of money. They are not the only ones doing this but they are doing it almost every week!! No wonder this place is always so empty!  While they do have a larger selection of some items it is not enough to get me to shop here regularly.

While this place is not very huge it definitely does not lack in flavor. I was first introduced to their great tasting grub a little over four years ago when the place I worked at used to be located down the street. One day after finding out someone had helped themselves to my lunch, I decided to place an order for a sandwich and a large ice tea.   What I received can only be described as one awesome sandwich. Meat and cheese were piled high and the veggies tasted like they came right out of a garden. Each bite made me happy and sad at the same time. Happy that I was feasting on such delicious food yet sad that because of my huge hunger this cold cut master piece would soon be gone. LOL OK so I may be putting a little to much on it but that was one seriously good sandwich!   They always offer the best tasting meat and cheese (dofino hmmm) and their selection of bread (nine grain, honey wheat, white, and sourdough) is great also if you are in the mood to mix things up a little. They also serve salads and soup if you are looking to complete your comfort food combo but by far your best bet is to go for the sandwiches. My recommendation is the complete picnic if you are REALLY hungry as this will fill even the largest belly guaranteed! So if you are tired of nasty and tasteless subs and those dumb $5 foot long commercials then give this place a try. Your stomach will thank you!

It has been a while since I visited this place but it left a definite impression on me. Now weather it was a good one or bad one, I have not decided yet! This is their second location and boy did it impress. This mega large laboratory as I see it allows the cooks in the back to mix up all kinds of Mexican/chinese combos all for your feasting pleasure.   My trip to this place resulted from a mini maraton of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. Being that I am a Arizona native and big man who loves to eat I decided to give this place a shot. After all how many places other than a buffet can you get different types of cuisine all on one plate? Not many.  From the moment I walked in I was greeted and offered a tour of all the different items and ways they could be combined. I swear it felt like I was taking a test LOL.   (OK you said I can get the spicy chicken made into what now?) I mean honestly if it is necessary for you to spend over 12 minutes explaining how to order food from your restaurant you may want to think about changing a few things around. But after taking the time to study I felt I was ready for my final exam, time to order.   OK let me say that for those who expect this place to turn out real homemade Mexican food, they will be disappointed. What they do offer is the chance to try things in new and different ways. Are they all a success? No! But with so many choices, an empty belly and a sense of culinary adventure I am sure you will want to try this place at least once in your life time. Who knows you may like a jerk chicken burrito or a jade chicken quesadilla but for me I will stick with the local takeout Chinese food joint. Why because when it comes to food you should not have to choose between simple and good, it should be simply good period. Case closed, class dismissed.

Well some call me a perfectionist but when I pay for things I expect to get great customer service, and a great product. This place met the first requirement no problem. From the moment we walked in we where taken to a table with lots of leg room ( I am 6 foot 7 so leg space is important) lol. The tables where clean and the dining room was free of clutter and dirty dishes (so far so good)!   Our waitress was real upbeat and took our drink orders while smiling at my little niece. After only a few minutes our drink orders were placed in front of us and our meal order taken. Now up to this point I will say that everything was looking good. The smell of bacon and buttermilk pancakes was making my stomach growl and my mouth water.   The raspberry tea I had ordered was sweet and cold just the way I like it. I sat there thinking could I really be happy with a meal from a chain eatery? Then with the sound of a plate being placed in front of me I was snapped back to a dreadful reality. My steak sandwich had arrived looking large enough to justify the price ($7.99 and includes fries) but it looked like it may have been made a few hours before hand and just reheated. The meat was over cooked and cold. The cheese was not even melted all the way and the bread was kind of hard. I could only handle a few bites before I gave up.   The fries on the other hand where great. Crispy, not oily and with a touch of seasoning salt for flavor. Almost like my grandma 's fries from when I was a kid. So would I eat here again? No not when I do not eat breakfast food and can still get a better sandwich from Red Robin.

I had been to this theater many times in the past but after a recent trip I had to ask myself, what happened? Over priced tickets for movies that have been out for several months, I do not think so. I went there with my nephew to see one of those Disney kid flicks and could not believe they had a huge line being handled by only 2 people.   Here it is over 100 degrees and me waiting in line. So I decide to go inside and buy tickets from the ticket kiosk. Big mistake!! The machine did not work correctly and told me that it could not complete the transaction. So after speaking to a clueless manager who acted like I was wasting her time by asking for her help,  she goes and prints out two tickets. So before we headed into the movie we stopped to get a drink at the concession stand. Guess what?   Another big line with only one or two people working. So after paying 4 dollars for a drink and $3.50 for a small popcorn that was old and stale ( requested fresh popcorn) I made a quick stop at the bathroom. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. It was dirty, with paper towels on the ground and toilets that would not flush.   To top it all off later that evening I found out that I had been charged 100 dollars for two tickets!! Turns out the ticket machine put through the charge but would not print my tickets. When I called the theater they said it happens all the time.  They offered no solution to the problem and I had to spend three hours on the phone with the bank to get the charges reversed. If you want to see a film, hit the local red box or blockbuster video and pick up snacks from the dollar store. Cost of movie and candy $10. Not paying $100.00 to see Star Trek, priceless.

Well I do not know what I was expecting to happen when I walked into this store as my past experiences have been pretty bad. Yes I could go to my local Wal-Mart or super pricey Best Buy store but, I like to buy a game without having to sell a kidney. Call me crazy (lol). Anyways my experience always starts off OK as I normally get at least a hi or a short glance in my direction to let me know that at least they noticed I have walked in the building.   The problems seem to start when I try to have a conversation with any of their employees. It seems that instead of hiring people who have ever played a video game, they would rather employ a staff of uneducated, and unmotivated teens more focused on talking about how much they hate their job. Now we all have done the same thing but not in front of customers while they are looking over merchandise.   Let me be fair and make the point that there are tons of games and many systems out there so it is impossible to know everything. But when I ask you about a game that you have posters for tacked up all over your store and you tell me you do not know then there is a problem. So will I ever go back there??   Maybe someday when they increase their selection, lower the prices, and take the time to train their employees. After all why stock 50 copies of a game no one wants instead of offering a more popular selection that will actually make you money?

I am a fan of big and tasty sandwiches but have had very few really good ones as of late. That is until I tried this place. I was in the area and decided to give the them a try after spotting their sign. When I first walked in I noticed the place was empty (normally a bad sign) but it was a Thursday afternoon so no big. This was my first time eating here so I took a few minutes to see what they had to offer. The sandwiches here come in different sizes from a small 5 inch to a 2 foot extra long, which makes it easy to decide what to order depending how hungry you are.  The 8 inch sub is easily enough for one really hungry person or two not so hungry people. Seriously it is about the size of a subway foot long and taste way better to! You have three choices when it comes to bread. They are white, wheat, and sourdough. I chose sourdough for my sandwich and it was chewy and seemed to be really fresh. Like most sub shops they also have a selection of pre selected combos (18 to be exact) with toppings like Ham, Turkey, Pastrami, Salami, Capicolla, Roast Beef, and Tuna. The cheese selection includes Provolone, Swiss, Smokey Cheddar & American  What makes this place so different from most sandwich joints is the fact that they hand slice your meat when you order it. No more slimy meat that has been sitting in a case for hours and floating in weird juices Yuck! Finally a place that understands that it is OK to take the time to slice meat for each customer because it makes for a better tasting sandwich. One that a customer will want to come back for over and over again  For me this place set the bar so high most of the other chain places will never be able to compare with the quality of not only the food but the great customer service that I received from this place. It is not often that a place is able to make such a great impression on me (read my other reviews) but I will definitely make sure to give them my business the next time I am in the mood for a sandwich. The only thing that brought their score down was the fact that they had no customer parking and I had to pay to park in the garage. Yes I understand it is Tempe but why not at least offer to validate my parking LOL.

Well I have been here many times in the past so I know what to expect even before walking through the door. There is the Welcome to Red Robin greeting, followed by the question as to how many are in your party? That is where the similarities end with this half burger chain and half sports bar and most chain restaurants.   Yes there are other chain restaurants with locations scattered in and around the valley that all promise the same hand crafted burger masterpiece, but how many of them offer that delicious burger combined with bottomless fries? They may all offer similar products but ask anyone with any experience with chain style eateries and they will tell you there are always those small yet noticeable differences.   This location is near to the mall which means it is usally populated by middle aged couples, 30 somethings who like a few cocktails with their meal ( watch out for them on the road) , and teens who want to hang with friends and share some really tasty burgers. Their claim to fame is their large selection of burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, and drinks. I normally order the mushroom swiss, or a bacon blue cheese burger.   With each juicy bite I can feel my stomach growing and my waist line expanding LOL. Seriously if you want those little dried out frozen patties found at your local drive through then this is not the place for you. Honestly as with BBQ it is important to understand that if you are going to do something make sure you do it right!!! Don't take shortcuts, make sure you use the best ingredients you can afford, and most of all do not call something that it is not!!   It is like saying you want a Philly Cheese steak sandwich and then cooking a package of steakums and placing it on two slices of white bread.  Seriously with about 13 of  what they call their signature burgers, 7 kinds of bread, 7 kinds of cheese, and a toppings list that would make old Mcdonald which they came from his farm this is the place to indulge all your grilled beef fantasies. Just make sure you learn from my experience and wear your large eating pants. Trust me you will need them.  Case closed

OK so by now most people know I am a pretty patience guy but every time I eat here it seems as if time slows down.The words fast food can not and should not be used when describing this place. First off let me start by saying that this place while a chain seems to be the broken link.   In the last three times I was forced to eat here (friends choice) I did not recive my complete order, was over charged, and received food that looked like it was left by a previous customer. Soggy fries, burgers coated in so much grease the bun would have slid off had it not been for all the cheese that held it to the wrapper! Of course this was after the long wait time (clocked at over 12 mins by my friend on one visit!) So why do people still eat here is my question? Maybe they are still stuck on the memories of cold and tasty frosty's.   Or maybe it was the times they enjoyed a biggie drink with free refills on a blazing 110 summer day here in phoenix. Who knows? I think that since they were acquired by Arby's there was no place for them to go but down hill. Dave Thomas would flip in his grave if he could see the tiny dried up squares of cow flesh his customers where offered for their hard earned dollar, and Wendy well she would be in tears!  R.I.P. to Wendy's and to another childhood memory.

Been here a couple of times now and have to say I really like what they are doing here. I wanted to try out this recipe for turkey burgers with sun dried tomatoes and needed a bread that could hold up to it. Walking in, the place is laid out really simple yet there is much to offer. On the right is a sample bar of different types of breads along with olive oil for dipping awaiting anyone looking for a little sneak peak of what is to come. If you have a sweet tooth they usually offer a taste of their desert bread as well.  As for their selection they have the standard white and wheat bread for those who are looking for something more traditional. If you are feeling a little adventurous try the jalapeno cheese sourdough. Or do as I did and pick up a couple of their fresh baked ciabatta rolls for sandwiches or burgers. Listen there are a lot of places out there for bread but this place offers a great product without all the long lines or the huge markup of Scottsdale. A little more expensive than a loaf of walmart bread but better tasting and fresher to. Give them a try the next time you are in the area.

I should know better than to go against the yelp family when it comes to trying some of these places. Seriously this place was like a trip to the doctor and you find out you need to get your colon checked. Not fun but necessary according to some people. I do not eat out very much anymore but can not say no to a cheese steak sandwich. Something about that thin sliced meat, onions, and melted cheese makes me feel like all is right in the world. But with my first bite of over cooked, cold, and tasteless meat I was kicked in the meatballs and brought back to reality.  It amazes me that a place that seems to focus on one thing does such a bad job at it! It is like McDonald's and their crappy burgers, or taco bell and their mystery meat/refried bean concoctions. Why can't these places stop with all the dorky names and just work on making their food taste better? Corleone needs to start by adding seasoning to their meat while removing some of the grease (what you can see through the bag? Forget about it!!) Listen I do not mind a little grease but if your bag starts to dissolve due to the amount of fat dripping out of the sandwich then we have a problem. Also for the price ($14) I could have purchased a rib eye steak, sub rolls, an onion, steak fries, slice cheese, and a 2 liter of soda and made enough food for 4 people! A sandwich with fries and onion ring (ok to be fair there were about 4 in the bag) for $14 was not worth the effort to get it, or money spent to eat it. Pass this place on by unless you like being made an example of, the example of a sucker that is!  Btw saying a place uses Cheese Whiz means nothing as the stuff sucks and you can buy it at the supermarket.

You have to forgive me as I am a little sad today. One of the cheapest, and best chicken places has gone totally down hill. In the world of fast food chicken places it is normally a choice between KFC or Church 's. In fact until today I would have said Church 's by a mile. Disagree? Then let 's talk price for a minute.   When you can get eight pieces of chicken, four biscuits,  a side of mashed potatoes and gravy plus coleslaw all four around $10 then there is no choice involved. There is just me asking for some hot sauce and a pile of napkins. (LOL) But after moving to Michigan for a few years and having no choice but to pay the super high prices the colonel commands from his troops (customers),  I was looking forward to moving back to Arizona and some good fried chicken.   But somehow things are never as great as you remember them. My first experience with Church 's was not only a disappointment but a slap in the face. Forgotten were the memories sweetened by the warm honey butter biscuits I used to enjoy. Gone were the days when I sat with my grandma and feasted on tasty fried chicken. Now all that remains is the smell of burned food that taste like it had been made three days before and reheated till it was almost charcoal.    I mean come on I like dark meat but this was ridiculous. Maybe to increase profits they were selling this cremated fowl as fuel to KFC to make their grilled chicken with (LOL). But seriously though the food was really bad. The biscuits looked like the kind you buy at the store just with a little smear of honey and were rock hard. This is to bad because they sold one of the better tasting biscuits sold by a chain ( KFC 's taste like they used to much flour, and Popeye 's is way to salty for my taste).   The bottom line is with great power comes great responsibility. If you have a great product do not mess with it. Just keep cranking it out and offering it at a affordable price. Why? It is simple, because you will make a lot of money.(LOL) I only hope that someone at Church 's will awaken from this nightmare and start making the food that makes good memories instead of just making people sick.

It was a dark and stormy night here in the valley of the sun. Clouds were rolling in faster than the light rail on a summer day. Even with the rain falling it was as sticky out as a pan of rolls from Cinnabon. As for me I was sitting on my porch contemplating whether or not to take this special case. With my belly rumbling I really had no choice. So after deciding to move on with my investigation I got in my car and started to cruise down Southern Ave in the heart of East Mesa, I passed by all the local late night suspects hangouts.   Wendy's- no thanks! KFC- Sorry Colonel but you have failed too many times in the heat of battle, and I was still a little scarred from my sub battle with the sandwich Nazi (read my subway review). Jack in the box and Mcdonalds looked open but I was in no mood to clown around. This hunger of mine was getting out of control and I was the only one that could stop it. Just when all hope seemed lost and I would have to make a run for the border ( taco bell) a light from heaven or a little neon sign (I forget which one) that read Great China Super Buffet came into view.   Now anyone who knows me at all knows I hate all things buffet, but if I wanted to solve this case and get rid of my gut wrenching hunger I knew I had no choice. So I did what any good food detective does and went in. Wow what a huge place. It was the kind of place that promised a good time if you were willing to spend a little dough. Over 200 items all waiting to tempt your palate and tickle your taste buds.   Several freshly made dishes gave off scents that made my mouth water and my throat close at the same time as i sucked each nostril full, hoping that maybe the different flavors would enter my mouth and turn into food if I held them captive long enough. No such luck! So after speaking to the nice waitress I was handed a menu (got takeout) and took my time to study my file (menu). I had dealt with this cast of characters before. There was the delicious yet seductive Lady Moo Shu.   She is the kind of dish that excites your taste buds and leaves you stumbling all over yourself waiting for the next bite. Then there is the General, Tso is his name and he commands his army to march right through the middle of flavor town. His attacks are swift and his spicy flavor bombs will blow away all your hunger till nothing remains. Eager to solve this case and eat some delicious food I ordered and dashed home. Each bite of chicken was just like that little light had been, pure heaven!   Even though I was eating a meal at home they had somehow managed to take all those great smells and create a meal that made me wish it was my last. Why? Because how can I ever go back to the old neighborhood place that serves food that looks like it came from the frozen section at your local grocery store? I can't, I won't go back! Bottom line is you don't have to be a food detective to know this place offers some of THE BEST Chinese food in the STATE case closed. Now lets eat!

I had passed by this tiny yet well placed little shop many times in the past but had never had the time to drop in until last night. It has been so long since a place met all my requirments then blew them out of the water. Seriously this is one of the best places to grab a cool and delicious treat. With flavors like banana chocolate and Tiramisu how can you go wrong?   For those who have never had really good ice cream this is your new must try place. Gelato is Italian ice cream that is creamer and richer tasting than normal ice cream. It has less butter fat, and normally has less sugar content as well. Just two more reasons to order a large right? LOL Unlike American style ice cream true artisan gelato holds its peak flavor and texture (from delicate ice crystals) for only days, even when it is stored carefully at the proper temperature. This is why gelaterias typically make their own gelato on the premises or nearby.  Also this results in products that are fresher and better tasting than ice cream that may be in the case for several weeks. So if you are ready to try fresh, homemade goodness that comes from people who care not only about the product they put out but what their customers want then run to this place tonight!!! Seriously don't wait as they change flavors often and you may miss out on the flavor of your dreams.  Popular flavors: Chocolate, lemon, coconut, cherry, vanilla bean, zuppa inglese (based of a popular desert made of sponge cake), and peach just to name a few.

I still remember the first time I visited this place. Having to wait for over half an hour to get in ( place must be good right)! People walking out with their take home bags full of food and a rather large group of people waiting to get in from out of the cold night air. This place is different in many ways from most sit down eating establishments you may find in this town. To make my point I will use one of the all time movie classics from my childhood, Honey I shrunk the kids.   Now we all know that we are in a recession and that means people are spending less which means restaurants have fewer customers. This results in many places cutting portion sizes and raising prices to increase their profits. This is the what I like to call honey I shrunk the kids( plate). Why would I pay more for less?? Most places are like the first movie in the sense that people in the film thought making things smaller would be beneficial to everyone but it turned out to be anything but.   This place however is more like the final movie in the series, honey I blew up the kid! Who ever coined the phrase bigger is better was talking about this place. Burgers the size of portable TV 's, and a chocolate eclair the size of a small lap dog that would put anybody into a diabetic comma make this place worth going to at least once if you like to eat. I think of this restaurant as a great place to see a dinner and a show.   It is fun to watch slabs of meat come from the back and placed in front of someone who just sits there wide eyed and can only say WOW! Sure at most places big people like myself have to feel self conscious when we go for the biggest thing on the menu. Why? because of the childish laughter that comes from super skinny women and their shaggy ( from scooby doo) boyfriends, but not at this place!   Everything on the menu is BIGG!! So when these walking skeletons start to laugh just turn right around and laugh back at them and say '' Wow you sure can eat!'' LOL. Now I do agree with many of the other reviews when they mention the fact that the service is slow or sometimes just down right bad. Out of the three times I have eaten here only once did I have a server that really was on their toes. Drinks were brought out shortly after ordering them.   Our food came out in a short amount of time and was prepared just as requested, and drinks were refilled without anyone having to hunt someone down. So is this place worth eating at? Sure if you are a group of people who just want to share a monster plate of food, or a couple who like to eat, or....... '' sigh" Look just go there and enjoy the food. Just make sure that you go when they are not as busy to lessen the chance of problems with the service or lack there of.

The one thing I can say about this place is that it always delivers when you are really hungry. I was spending the day with my aunt and cousin so I wanted a place that had great food and plenty of it ( they like to eat to lol) and claim jumper was near by. I had not eaten here since the last time I ordered a widow maker burger and they almost had to cart my overstuffed body out the front door, but I knew I would be OK with backup in tow.   The place had the same decorations that I was used to (mining tools,carts) but it seemed to be missing something. Normally the place is packed but there seemed to be many open seats (was a Sunday afternoon after all). We were told by the greeter that it was open seating and that we could sit anywhere we wanted which was nice but kind of weird. The NBA playoffs were on near the bar so after deciding on a booth that allowed my cousin and I to view two T.V.'s we were greeted by our waiter. He gave my family the rundown since it was their first time here on how big the portions were but also informed them that they now also offered half portions as well. I was kind of bummed that I would not be able to get my glass of raspberry ice tea( they no longer serve it) but our waiter was quick to point out that they do serve a tropical ice tea which was really good.  After my aunt finally placed her order for a appetizer our server was off to the kitchen to place the order.   Now as I said in my last review when it comes to the food this place is top notch. The problem is with the staff as there seem to be many of them but none that are really interested in getting your food out in a timely manner. Our apps were on the table in what seemed like minutes which is not hard considering that it is probably already pre-made but our entries took over 30 minutes to come out! Not cool. But it did give us time to sit and watch the game. My cousin ordered the BBQ ribs which she said were smokey and really good. I decided to temp fate and ordered the widow maker with seasoned fries which looks like the burger version of the matter horn at disneyland. After the the normal looks of shock that newbies get when they eat here for the first time, we dug in. Each bite was delicious and flavorful. The bacon, and avocado worked better than Steve Nash and Amare in their game against the Trailblazers. Normally I switch back and forth between fries and my burger but this massive monster had me in it's grasp and would not let go.  All things considered this place still suffers from the same issues it did in the past. Anyone who knows me knows that bad service is a deal breaker when deciding if and when I will return to a place, but when it comes to eating here I guess I have to bend if not brake my own rule lol. Our server made this little family gorge fest a better one so I will return but just not right away. For now claim jumper you can keep all your stars but until the staff problem is fixed you are still in the danger zone.

Other than barbeque there is nothing that has caused so many to claim that they are the best as with chicken wings. I can not resist a good chicken wing and this place does a great job of making some of the best. With tons of flavors to choose from you do yourself a disservice by not trying this place if you call yourself a true wing lover.   Meaty with skin that is crispy, not rubbery like some places ( the streets of new york, domino's) these little birds were made to fly right into my mouth ( yes I know it is the wing not the whole bird lol). I used to go there twice a month to get their bourbon beans,potato wedges, and a monster variety pack of wings when I would go to a friends house for Sunday afternoon football on TV. Everything always tasted so good and there would be nothing left over. The only real problem I have with this place is with the long wait time.   I mean come on these people are making wings not painting the Mona Lisa! LOL seriously 20 minutes for 12 little wings? Not cool! Now I know things take time to cook but with a fryer at 350 it should take no more than a few minutes to  get my order ready to go. To save time I now call in my order and by the time I pull in everything is ready to go. Problem solved . Now let's eat! Who has the blue cheese? LOL

You know those people who keep telling you how great a place is and will not leave you alone till you try it? I suggest telling them to back off LOL or at least I should have in this case. Cheese cake that creamy, dreamy, diet ending evil little creation is what this place "claims to do best". WRONG!!!!!!!  Over priced ($7 for a slice) and just not good tasting in any way. The crust was soggy and the filling was like a cross between that jello cheese cake stuff and a box cake mix. Weird! They offer several flavors to choose from but I had the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. The banana extract they use reminded me of the syrup from a snow cone. It over powered the whole slice of cheesecake. Also not sure how much sugar they use but it was way to sweet. Bottom line if you are looking for a decent store bought cheesecake try Safeway or Costco.   I know they are a chain but this is one of those times were a factory closure would be a good thing!

Sticking with my New Year's resolution to lose a few pounds,  I have started walking my dog about 3-4 miles every morning. With the temp slowly creeping up I tend to go out early as possible.  With not much going on that early in the morning you tend to notice things. This was one. After passing by this place a few times I decided to do a little investigating.   OK so let me get a few things out the way. The area is not bad as others have said (there is a high school next door so how bad can it be?). It is in a strip mall so the restaurant is not very big. They have been in business at the same location for over 20 years. Also a word of warning the place does get packed by the early bird crowd around 4pm so come early or after 6pm if you want a good table. Also while the place is not what I would call fancy you can tell that they have actually put some thought into how the place was decorated.   Nice solid wood tables are set up family style with little booths in the back, a perfect place for teens and the young at heart to grab a slice with their sweet heart. They even went so far as to put a table in front of the open kitchen so you can watch as they create your meal from scratch. Their claim to fame is the pizza they offer. One look at the menu and you see the usual cast of characters. But what stood out to me was they offer wheat and gluten free products for those looking for a few options. Their pizza sizes are kind of unusual as they start with a 8 inch mini and go up to a 16 inch extra large. The sauce was light and nice tasting and the crust lived up to the sourdough claim as well. Not over powering but the flavor was a nice change up from the usual chain offerings. Not in the mood for pizza (what is wrong with you?) they also offer pasta, deserts, sandwiches, soups and salads. This is one great little neighborhood place! And I for one am glad to be it's neighbor (Mr. Rodgers music plays) LOL.

OK so writing a bad review for this place is almost like a high school kid kicking a defenceless baby , it just does not make any sense. But what I have to say is to important. DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE EVER!!!! Seriously I understand that not everyone likes taco bell or has the time to make food at home but eating this food is not a option it is a dare. Like I dare you to eat that taco and not spend most of the night on the bathroom floor with your face deep in the toilet bowl.  I would give this place a half star if I could because the only thing good about this place is the fact that they are cheap enough for the people who are crazy enough to think the stuff they sell here is food. This is not a review it is more like a public service announcement.   Attention great citizens of AZ do not eat here unless you enjoy, then have the fast talking guy from those medication commercials read a list of side effects (eating this food may cause bubble gut, late night trips to the ER, stomach pumping, the shakes, and forced consuming of various intestinal aids such as tums and pepto bismol) lol.

After watching Kick ass at the near by Harkins, my buddy and I decided to walk down the street and grab a bite to eat. I was being treated for my birthday (it was actually on Thursday the 22nd) so I was hoping for a good time. Last time we split a Chicago pan pizza which was really huge and good. The greeter took us right to our table near the bar and in perfect view of the start of the Laker game.   Our server was a great help in narrowing down our choices as we both wanted to try something new besides the pizza. I ordered the chicken parm and he had the cheese tortellini. Both came out after about 20 minutes which seemed longer given that I had missed breakfast but was worth it when I saw the food. Nice looking chicken breaded and baked till crispy not soggy. They also did not skip on the cheese which was a great thing in my book as I am a big cheese freak LOL.  Everything was great until I tasted the pasta sauce. Instead of mumm, it was more like What the hell is this! All I can say is yuck! The sauce tasted like a can of tomato sauce, mixed with one of those season packets from a pack of chicken flavored top ramen. Now I do not like to send my food back (seen to many of those caught on camera specials on fox I guess) but I had to this time. I asked the waitress if this is the main sauce they use for all their dishes and she said yes except for the pizza. Thank goodness for that was my thought.   That left me with very limited choices so I decided to just finish my meal with a order of mozzarella sticks. The chicken parm was removed and was taken off our bill which was great but left me with the birthday blues. After about the second cheese stick I was ready to go. My buddy was buzzing like a happy little bee after the two beers and a double shot of Irish whiskey he had so we paid the check and left.  Now I know this place does one thing and does it really well and that is Pizza. As long as that is what your order then you are golden, but try to stray into the path of the unknown and you to will be sorry.

Another in a line of chipotle style rip offs this place offers the usual cast of faux Mexican dining fare. White rice, black beans, corn, and a few meat options, check. Hipsters who act like they can not put down their phones yet are so concerned about saving the earth, check. While there is nothing wrong with the idea (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery) just how many of these places do we need?  In my opinion if you are going to copy something at least bring something new to the table when you do! This place does not meet that goal. In fact they manage to mess up some of the basic things that chipotle did right while charging you more at the same time. That is quite a feat to pull off lol. My order was for two burritos (one pork, green sauce, brown rice, cheese and the other shredded beef, cilantro lime rice, black beans and hot sauce). Both were a nice size (compared to chipotle) yet cost almost a full 2 dollars more! The pork had a nice spice but was to salty for me. The green verde sauce was ok but tasted of mostly tomatillos. It could have used something to balance it out like cumin, roasted poblanos, honey or even some more garlic. With drinks the total came out to something like 22.50 for two people! I can make this food at home for way less than that and still have money left for dessert. While it is nice to try eating somewhere new it is not worth almost $25 and 110 plus degree days just to eat here again. Good for some but for me No Bueno!

Well I was out and feeling a little hungry so I decided to drop in a grab a bite. Imagine my surprise when I arrived and the lights were off, and the sign taken down. What happened??! Did the snow birds drive this little shop out of town? Who knows? Guess I will have to go to the other location "sigh". Note: this is in reference to their location that was on the border of Apache Junction and Mesa. This location closed and they moved to the location on power.

This was my first time eating here and my last! I am not a subway fan so I figured I would give this place a shot as it is near my house. Never have I had so big an issue with ordering a sandwich. When I walked in I took some time to look around the store and the menu to see what they had to offer. Big mistake! The lady at the counter gave me this look like I had spit on the floor or something. After about 5 mins of looking at the menu I decided to order the firehouse hero sandwich. Their prices are way more than I expected but figured if the sandwich was any good then it would be worth it.  As I paid for my sandwich and went to sit down I heard the counter lady say something like this guy needs to be going to Jenny Craig not here! I could not believe she would sit there and talk about a customer like that. Her personal feelings aside (btw aren't sandwiches supposed to be a healthy food option?) She should have kept it to herself. Or at least said it once I left. I am a big person but that has nothing to do with how I should be treated. As for the food I have to say I was not impressed. The Virginia honey ham was way to sweet for me. It had this weird almost maple syrup flavor that overpowered the rest of the sandwich. After 2 bites I was done. Bad service, high prices, and even worst food earn this place a nice spot on my never again list.

After months of watching these CiCi's commercials for pizza for under $5 a person I had to investigate for myself. I had been mislead before with the promise of cheap yet good tasting pizza (anyone remember eatza pizza)? Back when I was a kid there was one day out of the month that I looked forward to when it came to the school lunch, and that was pizza day! Sure it was nothing more than the kind that your mom bought and tossed into the microwave when she did not feel like cooking, but to you it was still pizza LOL. Now as an adult I have learned the difference between that and what real pizza is.  An all you can eat pizza buffet how can that be a bad thing right? Well in this case it can be really, really, bad trust me!! Let's start with the concept. For $4.99 you gain access to salad, pasta, and of course pizza. Except the pasta looks old and flavorless, the salad taste like it has been sitting out to long and the pizza........ well it taste horrible.   They claim to offer over 10 types of pizza yet all I saw was three pepperoni and two cheese pizzas. They did finally make a sausage pizza when someone asked for it but  with so many people there it was gone in 60 seconds (eat your heart out Nick Cage Lol) and it took about 15-20 minutes for them to put out another one! The pasta looked bad but I gave it a shot (big mistake). It tasted like someone just overcooked a box of pasta and threw in a jar of Ragu and some left over chicken and cheese.  Just so you don't think that all I plan to do is bash this place I will say that the tea was really good. But it was nestea so is it fair to give them credit for something they do not make? Sure....... humm I guess LOL. To be fair what does one really expect to get when they spend only $4.99? Good food that does not give you stomach pains the rest of the night? Pride in the products you offer? I don't even know anymore LOL.   I guess I will do what my grandma's friend used to and lower my expectations. For some this is good food at a price they can afford. But speaking as a person with taste buds I will have to say thanks but no thanks.  Good pizza for under $5.00? not here  Case closed

I am trying to eat healthy so I do not eat take out much these days. But I happened to be in the mood for some chinese food and did not have things needed to make any. That is where J & M came in to the picture. I remembered that they delivered, so after looking them up on Yelp I called and placed my order. Now let me say that the food has been good both times I have eaten here. The rice seems fresh and the orange chicken I ordered even had real orange zest in it.  The egg rolls while not greasy seemed a little cold but nothing a microwave can't fix right?  They even threw in a large glass of ice for my 2 liter of coke lol. Yes I have always had a pretty good experince with them except when it comes to the wait time for the food to be delivered. I kid you not it took almost a full hour just to recive my order. But I will chalk this up to the driver most likely getting lost. Try this place out when you don't feel like cooking and want something besides pizza.  Note: Like everyone said before me they do have a $20 minimum order for delivery.

This place used to be known as the Feedbag a few years back but now has been turned into a local chinese food spot. When you first walk in you are greeted by a very nice person (big points) and offered a table. The place is decorated simply yet is very clean and open. In fact you can see into the kitchen through the large service window.   The food selection is very simple yet really well done. Most people who like chinese or just want a change from the all you can eat buffet will enjoy eating here as the food is affordable (each dish under $5) and very well prepared. After going over the menu I decided to try the chicken teriyaki over steamed white rice. Note: there is an extra charge for brown rice. It also came with a side of steamed broccoli which was good but a little to crunchy. The chicken was cooked perfectly with the sauce adding that nice bit of sweet flavor you expect. Not overpowering, it also added nice flavor to the rice.  The place has not been up and running for long but I can see myself visiting them again soon. If you are in the area stop in and check them out.

Anyone who knows me knows how serious I take my BBQ. The problem with living in the far east valley is the lack of quality restaurants near by. Even with a dry cleaner, among other small mom and pop shops near by this place does a good job of drawing you in with the smoky and sweet smell of slow cooked meat. This is not your backyard grilled meats masquerading as BBQ after hiding under a overdose of super sweet sauce. No! this is meat the way it was meant to be cooked. Big hunks of meat cooked low and slow transforming into tender and juicy meat so good tasting you will wish you had three stomachs.  LOL sorry kind of wandered off there for a minute but I'm back now.   Anyways the place is set up very simply with small yet well spaced out tables each offering one of three kinds of sauce (sweet, mild, and I believe a hot version. Now I like sauce but had to say I was not a big fan of these. The owner seemed to have added Italian salad dressing to them as a way to add extra flavor.   In the past I have heard of others doing this but in this case it did nothing but add a weird after taste to the sauce. The hot version had a good kick but again had the same after taste issue. I recommend just forgoing their sauce altogether and just using one you have at home. Anyways moving on to the main attraction which is the meat. Others who have reviewed this place said it had a great smoky flavor and My texas brisket sandwich did not disappoint.   The meat was tender, had a good outside bark and smoke ring letting me know the person cooking this food knew what they were doing. As this was my first time here I just stuck to the meat (no sides this trip) but my friend has and thought the cole slaw was ok but was kind of watery. If you have a sweet tooth they also offer sweet treats like pecan pie and cookies. Overall I have to say the food I had was good and I do look forward to trying other menu items in the future. The prices may keep some people away but while you are going to pay more than you would for one of those fake BBQ Mc rib sandwiches I say it is more than worth it. Don't believe me then try it for yourself.

Have to say with valentines day coming up I was hoping my love of this place was going to last longer but it ended faster than a relationship on the bachelor. Greasy pizza, and super hard sub bread that almost pulled my teeth out as I tried to rip off a hunk made that clear. The sad part is the guy taking my order mentioned that he was looking to change his bread supplier (now I know why)! What makes me mad though is as a owner or manager how do you serve something like this to a paying customer and not care? I mean he made the sandwich so it was not like he did not get a chance to notice it. I guess I could give it a pass if it had been toasted but that was not the case. A cold sandwich with stale bread, and green bell peppers which taste like they were coated in sugar did not a tasty sandwich make. This place has not been around to long so they still have a chance to turn it around. As I always say try it out and judge for yourself but as for me this is one fat boy who is going to cut this place out of his diet.......
