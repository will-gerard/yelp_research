This is my go to spot for any type of Italian food. The fresh mozzarella and tomato/basil sandwich is amazing and the bread is always warm and fresh.  Make sure you bring a book or something to occupy your time because this place is always busy. The wait can sometimes but 20-30+ minutes and seating in the summer is always difficult.  If you are able to save room for dessert make sure and pickup a slice of NY cheese cake or maybe even a rainbow cookie.

Target is one of my favorite stores. They have everything you can possibly need. This store is always so neat and organized. They have super fast checkouts which is a huge plus. I live close by so I am here multiple times a week.  I was in here today looking for baby items and the sales associates were so helpful and informative.  The only problem is that I end up buying much more than I came in for! It's hard to resist their huge selection especially in the home and baby sections!

I've belonged to this gym for a year now and it was such a great decision. They have such a wide variety of classes. This is one of my favorite parts because sometimes that is what helps to get me to the gym when I'm tired. There is a huge variety of cardio and weight equipment. I never have to wait. The locker rooms and showers are sparkling clean. There is a rock wall and a fantastic racquetball court. You have the option of an indoor or outdoor pool. There is even a full spa. The staff is so helpful and friendly. This is definitely much more than a gym.

I know this is a Fry's signature but it certainly doesn't feel that way. I have been to two other Signature Fry's one in scottsdale and one in paradise valley. This one is not as clean or organized as the other two.  I only ran in here to pick up milk on the way home from work. Unless it's a necessity, I will not be returning to this location.

I was looking for a new nail place. I came here and got a manicure and pedicure. Pricing is right on for the area. The pedicure was so relaxing. I got a great foot/leg massage which is one of the most important parts of a pedicure. The manicure was also really good and both lasted pretty well.   I will definitely be back.
