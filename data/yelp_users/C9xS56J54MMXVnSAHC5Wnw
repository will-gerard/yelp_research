Eat at this IHOP often, Always late night and always have the same waiter, Ernie. He does a surprisingly great job, no matter how busy it is. Insures food is correct, cooked properly, and always friendly and courteous

Best quality work. Best service and fairly priced.  You won't go wrong here. They do a great job on all their framing.

Best bread in Arizona no doubt. And the best breads make the best sandwiches. Haven't tried breakfast yet but I will.

Really disappointed. Been eating here for three years. Have often had the wood fired chicken and was always tasty and moist. Now the last two times it's been precooked and either micro waved or reheated on the flat top.  I get speed is important but if you say wood fired it should be done to order makes big difference in quality. I will try the wood fired salmon next time and hope for the best

Service here is terrible really bad.  Understaffed, unorganized, inefficient. Not even apologetic. Verizon is ten times better. Been here thirty minutes, no one ahead of me.  Sounds like employees are trying  to make friends not customers

I discovered this place three months ago and keep going back.  Whether I go in the AM for a jolt, noon for a great lunch or in the eve for a cocktail and light dinner I am always very pleased.  Their creativity and use of quality,fresh and local products is very much appreciated.  After owning ten restaurants over 30 years, I think I am pretty savy when it comes to food and service and this place blows me away.  The other thing that blows me away are people who use this platform to slam businesses who don't meet their particular expectations. I am not talking about critiquing the food, service or ambiance, I am referring to the haters who are more often than not, rude and demanding, if not just ignorant, refusing to read the menu, ask questions and just expect everything to be as THEY think it should be,and if their expectations aren't met want it for free. They should work a shift as an owner, manager or server. Over my 30 years I threw out many a rude guest, ( although I am sure they thought they were right in their justifiably deserved attitude) out of support and respect for my hard working employees. Luckily I sold my restaurants before Yelp became so popular. I love Yelp because it helps me find new places that I might otherwise might not, but I hate it because it encourages HATERS and gives them a platform to complain, making them feel like they got the last word. I guarantee you that this place will be around for a long time. Its trend setting and the owner and staff execute at a level rarely experienced in a small, local establishment.

Nice little pub. Great steak for the money. 18 bucks for a flat iron cooked just right. Friendly service.  Very comfortable

Excellent. Tried three apps and dessert.  Had the Caprese, sausage and peppers, meatballs and tiramisu for dessert. All were prepared with care and the service at the bar was spot on.  Will be back very soon. Thank you

Second week in a row I ate here. As close to perfection as you can get. From the Caesar salad to the pizza to the creme brûlée and espresso it was wonderful.  I am a new regular. Thank you

Busy place . People must like to go to popular, cool places. But it's all about the food for me. Eggs benedict special was underwhelming. Muffin ok.  Egg not running at all. A capital sin in the Benedict world.  Sauce portion very small , especially for price (12.95) and home fries luke warm.  Def not wow

Recently stopped in for the eggs benedict . Underwhelmed. Potatoes luke warm. Muffin just warmed , eggs not runny, skimpy on hollandaise.   Don't get why you all are so impressed.  Six item menu?  What decent restaurant couldn't  do that we'll.  how bout some variety?

Been here several times. Service had certainly improved and food seems more consistent.  Need a little more southwest flavors a little toooo hipster but worth a try

Food pretty good and service friendly just poorly managed.  Second time they couldn't make change because no cash drawer and none of the five servers brought a bank.  Really?  Pretty basic

Mike at az steamers is the best.  Over twenty plus years I have used many carpet cleaners for my restaurants in Az and Cali. Mike not only does a great job but is also very punctual, patient if he has to wait to start, leaves premises as desired and fairly priced.   He even checks the next day to make sure you are satisfied

Very consistent solid diner food with friendly service.  Owners seem to be on site a lot and treat employees well. Could use a little more originality on menu

Should have checked reviews.  Worst burrito ever. Cold and tasteless.  Even the iced tea sucked.  Service wasn't much better

Upscale breakfast brunch spot. Nice hotel like atmosphere.  Creative menu executed well in slow weekday morning. Great biscuit and superb coffee. Need to work on potatoes. Need to be hotter, fresh off grill  service by waiter very good but floor management lacking,  l will come back to try the waffle.
