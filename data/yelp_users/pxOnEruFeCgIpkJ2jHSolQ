Blows the roof off of local competitors in this type of food. I would go here at least three times a week if I lived closer. Great tasting and great for post workout.

Love this place, love that the merchants keep good brands and the upcoming styles in stock. I can always find a deal and what I'm looking for here. Great service everytime I've been in.

As long as I've lived in Arizona, since 2004, I've had the pleasure of knowing about this hidden gem. Fiorella's ristorante is a hidden italian restaurant in the back corner of the Fry's Food Store shopping center on the south east corner of 67th avenue and Happy Valley Road. I've been there many times and can't seem to ever find anything wrong with the place, except that not enough people eat there.   Authentic Italian food, fast, exceedingly well-made, and not too pricey. They accommodate holidays, and make your experience worthwhile. The majority of the time the owner, Fiorella is in there working harder than anybody else in there. It has a real italian restaurant feel, with a small town restaurant experience since it is such a little known restaurant. Their food is nothing but awesome! Also great for romantic dates, took my girlfriend there and she's begging me to take her back there!

Best Italian restaurant for the price. You will eat till your pants buttons burst and till you sweat garlic! Pizookie craze is done justice by Oregano's

Modern styles intertwined into a combo of cuisine between two cultures. Do not miss out on the Bandido.

This restaurant not only meets my standards as far as food goes, but even in the atypical situation where your steak is under done, the solution here is that the plate is so hot it will continue to cook as it sizzles in front of you. The appetizers are brilliant, the main courses exquisite, and the deserts to die for. I do not think the price should scare you away because it really meets the price to the cent. I recommend Mastro's highly to anyone I can.

The small coffee shop that makes you feel just relaxed. This place has great drinks, smoothies and food. If you are tired of starbucks feeling too generic this place fills your fix. The interior atmosphere is homely and brings out the uniqueness in this place. Definitely a hidden gem in the desert.

My favorite theatre in the valley to go to, always clean, and the staff is usually well mannered and ready to serve. Student discount is the biggest reason I go here over AMC because Harkins is a smarter business and offers better value to any customer. I will always go here first unless I have to go to one of the other guys.

I am a customer who supports a large "collection" of dress clothes and even at the low cost here still run up to $70 with just my stuff alone on occassion. This place is professional and does the job right, the only constructive criticism I have is I wish they could figure out the lead time to be just a bit quicker, I am always on a tight schedule so it can be hard for me to wait that long, but I wouldn't go anywhere else regardless.

The only thing I recommend here is the Chimichanga, and even though it is good, there is no sauce on it, which contrasts much of the great mexican styles in the area. Do not expect the best walking in here.

Great place to get married, I was married last month here, The staff is abolutely outstanding and I highly reccomend it to avoid the stress of finding vendors. Regale! has professionals picked out that you can choose from. Everybody loved our wedding based on the feedback I got from attendees. Very well priced, beats some of the inner phoenix venues in price and definitely more genuine here.

The best Mahi Mahi I've had yet! I've tried it now all over Arizona, in Hawaii and even in Tahiti where I recently was for my honeymoon. It took them almost the whole time of everybody elses dinners to cook to finish my Mahi, but it was worth the wait. I would definitely go back.

A major Starbucks competitor in price, quality, taste, and atmosphere. Watch out because the sirens should be ringing by now. Great place, I will be back.

I was happy with the taste and size of portions here. I heard it was expensive and when I went it wasn't so that must've changed along the line. This is more of a contemporary Italian restaurant but it compliments the area well.

Wasn't a fan. Food was dependent on you to come up with the recipe and with the type of food that can not end well. No creativity since the chef does it your way. I wasn't impressed.

Not bad customer service, but I do always feel that I get profiled in these types of stores for being younger (not the average CEO's age) and therefore they assume I'm not going to spend much here. It's always the minimum service, but well done minimum service. There online deals when they run promotions is the only reason I may buy here. Very generic selection.

For the price and the taste of the pizza I will make the drive whenever I possibly can. There is a lot of good Pizza in Arizona and this is definitely one of my top choices. Taste isn't the most unique, but it's always hot, consistent, and cost effective.
