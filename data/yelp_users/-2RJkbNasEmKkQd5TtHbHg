I would not recommend Autobahn tint. I took my brand new Z-06 Corvette in for some tint and an extensive clear bra package. There was damage done to the interior while they had it, which fortunately they paid for to repair. They lack attention to detail and seem careless with the vehicles. They also shuttled my car offsite to a different location to do the clear bra, and then to another location to wash the car after. This need to drive the cars that much just introduces too much risk for damage. I also ended up having to take the car to another shop  to get some areas redone where Brandon had done "hand trimming" which looked sloppy and inconsistent.

I had my 2015 Z-06 completely detailed and sealed with C-Quartz Finest by Wills and Dani.  They did an amazing job as they have the utmost attention to detail.  I've continued bringing the car back to them for regular washes as well, and it leaves looking as good as the day they initially detailed it.    Keep up the great work guys!

I've been a long time customer of TC's and have enjoyed going there until recently.  Most of the staff members and crowd are quite friendly however i realized ownership has no appreciation for loyal customers. I will be taking my business to Cogburns down the street as the management is always responsive and personable.

Food is typical bar food, nothing special, place sometimes reeks of sewage backup.  Service is hit or miss. They do show UFC fights for free but expect to get there early or you'll be standing and service on UFC night is below par....

Good Times lost their best guy in Austin Macke. It was embarrassing and uncomfortable to see how Ryan Bontems treated his employees. I'm so glad that my cage got welded up by Austin as its a masterpiece. I will no longer bring my business to Good Times Motorsports, as its difficult to support a business owner that doesn't respect or appreciate their employees or customers.
