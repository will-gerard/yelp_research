I had been looking forward to trying this place out for awhile.  However, I shouldn't have.    I ordered the brisket and pulled pork dinner and it came with a side, so I ordered mashed potatoes.  The meat was below average and didn't taste fresh.  The mashed potatoes were not good either.  The dinner roll that is used to put the meat on for the pulled pork was the only thing that was decent.  I did not care for the bbq sauce. I ordered the cherry cobbler but thew it out after one bite.  I do NOT recommend this restaurant.  If you want good bbq, go to Little Miss BBQ!

This is my 2nd "go to" movie theatre in the Valley of the Sun.  I prefer this location because every time I go there is not very many people and that is always a plus.  Also, I feel like I have more leg room than at the local Harkins theatre.

This theatre now has leather recliners & you can order a drink from the bar in the lobby & bring it to your theatre...this is nice because their aren't people walking around & taking orders.  The screen seems bigger than Regal Cinemas in Gilbert & Cinemark in Mesa.  Overall, I like it better than Cimemark (better recliners), but I still like Regal the best.

I had a terrible experience at this place.  I went through the drive-thru after a long day of moving.  I think it was about 1am when I ordered.  I ordered two crunchy ground beef tacos and a grilled chicken quesadilla.  The beef in the tacos were burnt and it was the worst taco I have ever eaten.  A complete waste of money.  The quesadilla wasn't much better.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  The ingredients weren't fresh and the food wasn't cooked properly.

I was disappointed with my experience here.  I made an order for carry-out early in the evening last week (8/21/2012).  I ordered two ground beef tacos with just meat and cheese.  I could have made way better tacos at home.  The cheese looked it was shredded and tasted like it was from a package at a grocery store.  The beef was bland and had didn't have much flavor.  The chips for the salsa were stale.  I also ordered a grilled chicken quesadilla with cheese and it was almost $12...way overpriced for the amount and the taste.  I would not recommend this place based on my personal experience here.

This restaurant was just okay to me.  I ordered a thin crust and it was just average.  The garlic cheese bread was the best part of the meal. It was tasty.  The staff was friendly, so that was a plus.

This is my favorite movie theatre in the Valley of the Sun.  I ordered my tickets online in advance for the exact seats that my girlfriend and I would be sitting.  This theatre has leather reclining seats.  There is tons of arm and leg room and you don't even have to get up if someone needs to walk through the row you are sitting in.  I look forward to catching many more flicks at this great establishment.

I ordered a pizza sub here and it was great.  They have a variety of different breads to choose from.  I really like the focaccia bread and the roll the best. The sandwiches are big and taste fresh.  I am looking forward to trying the pasta in the future.

I ordered a thin crust for carry-out one evening.  The place was somewhat hidden in an industrial area close to Tempe Marketplace.  The staff was very friendly and it seemed like a laid-back, cozy place to eat a meal.  I enjoyed my pizza.  The sauce tasted very sweet so be prepared for that.

I was very impressed with how well the food tasted here.  This is one of the best tasting burger places in The Valley!  It is not a glamorous establishment and it takes cash only.  However, the burgers and chicken are grilled on a huge charcoal grill right in front of you as you wait in line.  They have all sizes of burgers.  You can choose between a white or wheat bun and you can choose what cheese you want.  Also, there is a bar with condiments and toppings that you can choose from.  The fries were about average.  I don't like onions, but my friend said he liked their onion rings.  I would highly recommend this burger joint to anyone!  I will be back soon!

I wasn't impressed with this restaurant.  My burger was not that tasty and undercooked.  I didn't care for the fries or the cheese you can get with them.  If you are in the Tempe area and want a burger, I recommend that  you go somewhere better such as The Chuckbox or even Habit Burger.

I had a friend in town on a Monday evening.  We walked around Mill Avenue and decided to go in there.  Bad idea.  This place was disgusting and it smells horrible. I ordered a drink and almost threw it up.  It tasted spoiled.  The place is super dark and I'm guessing this is because the place is in such poor condition that they don't want you to see how bad the place is.  I would stay away from this place!

I really like this place.  It is spacious and the building is really cool.  I liked that it was modern and clean.  They even have flat screen t.v.'s above the urinals in the men's room.  It was easy for me to find a parking spot which is always a plus.  I like going here to watch a game, for happy hour, or to meet a friend for a drink.  The customer service has always been great.

I liked that this theatre had recliners and it was only $5.50 for the matinee. Also, it was not crowded.  However, the backside of the recliner doesn't go back very far.  For this reason, I prefer the recliners at Regal Theatre in Gilbert.

I ate here for lunch and really enjoyed my sandwich.  Bertha's has items such as fresh breakfast sandwiches, cookies, pie, brownies, lunch sandwiches, salads, and soups.  I ordered the cafe club because it looked delicious in the picture I saw from a fellow Yelper.  The sandwich was very tasty.  To me, the only minor flaw with the sandwich was that the bacon was a little too done/crisp for my liking and there was a little too much mayo on it.  The sandwich was very good and filling.  Next time, I am going to see if I can substitute the ham for roast beef.  I would recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys a salad, soup, or sandwich for lunch.

This is the best sandwich shop I have ever been to.  It is located on The Strip inside of Planet Hollywood.   The ingredients are always fresh.  Even the desserts have real ingredients and have nothing artificial in them from what I have seen.  I always make sure to eat here when I am in Las Vegas.  I look forward to them opening more restaurants in more cities around the nation.

I thought this restaurant was good.  It is ran by an older couple who have owned the place for years.  The inside is small (only 3 tables) and you order your food at the counter and you pick up the food at the counter.  The food was tasty and I was surprised how it wasn't that greasy at all.  This place is better than most places in the area as long as you aren't looking to have a waiter or waitress.

I was looking forward to this place based on the reviews here.  I ordered my favorite dish which is General Tso Chicken and white rice.  The rice was fine but the chicken chunks tasted just average.  I went at about 10pm last night (08/25/2012).  I am thinking about trying this restaurant once more just to see if it is better the next time.

I really liked this place.  It is a great place to meet someone for a drink. Here are the pros and cons for me:  Pros: +decent parking lot +cool, clean, and modern look +lights were dim (I'm not big into bright bars) +variety of options for seating +cocktails taste great +the noise level isn't too high +great place to go during the week or before 10 on Friday and Saturday nights  Cons: -I was served a beer in a frozen glass instead of a glass at room temperature -the chairs at the bar were uncomfortable -the bar isn't very big -the beers are overpriced -can get crowded after 10 on Friday and Saturday nights

I was excited about trying food from this place...but it was a huge letdown for me.  I ordered some food to go and I did not care for it.  I ordered 6 bbq boneless wings and 6 traditional wings (medium sauce) with fries.  I also ordered a breaded tenderloin sandwich...which most restaurants don't have around here.  I am from the midwest so it is more popular there.  Anyway, the boneless wings were not good at all and they even gave me the wrong bbq sauce.  I have had better frozen wings from a grocery store.  The traditional wings were just average at best.  The fries here were below average.  The only highlight of this place was that the food was ready on time and they lady at the bar was nice.

This place was just okay to me.  We had a party of four and sat at a picnic table inside. Our server was decent but halfway through the our time there she appeared to be heavily intoxicated.  I was disappointed that they only had one brew on draft. The quesadillas were disgusting, but the mini churros were decent.

I frequented this Chipotle location a lot in the past because I lived close to it.  Customer service was always great and things ran very smoothly there.  The taste is always fresh like every other Chipotle I've been to.  I think Chipotle should offer a medium sauce that's not as chunky as their pico, but not as hot as their hot sauce.

Here are my favorite dishes from them:  lasagna angel hair pasta with garlic sauce and shrimp angel hair pasta with marinara sauce and grilled chicken pork shops with green beans and pasta sausage and pepperoni pizza (they use very good crumbled sausage)  I highly recommend this restaurant!

This is a great place to get a great burger.  The patties are somewhat thin so you might have get at least a double.  I noticed that the bun was very fresh and tasted great.  It's probably the best bun I have ever had on a burger.  It was just perfect.  I have noticed that other fellow Yelpers are also feeling the same way.  The fries were below average to me. I will be back again someday for the burger!

I made an order for delivery on a Sunday evening and I was not impressed. I requested no lettuce on one of my subs and it was obvious they put lettuce on it and then tried to pick it off.  The bread was soggy as well.  The cookies I received were paper thin and the peanut butter cookie had a very weird taste to it.  I'm not sure I'll try this place again.

I got food for carry-out and it was very good.  I tried ordering my food over the phone but that was a big mistake because their were serious issues with this service.  However, I just showed up and then got my food to go.  The burger was very good and the fries were about average.  The prices were very reasonable and the customer service in person went more smoothly than over the phone.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good burger at a great price.

This is one of the best options out there for BBQ in Phoenix.  I ordered the cutter's choice brisket with a side order of macaroni and cheese.  The brisket was decent and the macaroni and cheese was average to me.  I would like to try and go back to try their turkey or ribs.  To me, Little Miss BBQ has better brisket and it's my favorite bbq place around.  However, this place has better hours of operation.  I would recommend this place because the bbq is good and the customer service is great.

This is one of my favorite pizza places in the Valley.  It can be a bit expensive but their pizza is consistently good.  I always order the sausage and pepperoni pizza.  Most places around here only have the sliced sausage, but Grimaldi's has crumbled sausage that I really like.  The pepperoni is miniature sized and is very good.  You can taste a little of the coal flavor on the crust and that makes it unique.  I highly recommend this place.

There are a couple bars to sit at and they even open a big door to a bar for the outside too.  They have some good brews on tap and have flat screen tv's as well.    I have only had a burger and fries here.  They burger was really good, the fries were really greasy and were just okay.  The staff here is friendly & speedy.

I was curious to find out if the Yelp reviews were true.  They were.  This place was a great and affordable steakhouse.  For the quality food that you get and the excellent customer service, you can't beat it.  Our waitress was Linda and she did an amazing job.  You get a variety of bread for free with your meal and we even received cornbread as well.  Then they brought out a sample of steak and they brought a sample of raspberry sorbet shortly after that.  I ordered the filet mignon with a baked potato and asparagus and my date ordered the ribeye with a baked potato and carrots.  Everything was delicious and cooked correctly.  However, I plan to order a ribeye or strip next time because the filet mignon didn't fill me up enough.  This place is very nice on the inside and I highly recommend checking it out.  With our meals and two drinks, our bill was $48 and some change!  Not bad at all!

This frozen yogurt spot has a few great flavors and it's in the East Valley.  I had the sea salt caramel and the cinnamon bun and it was delicious.  I hope they will have their oatmeal cookie flavor when I come back again. I didn't care how they had some of their toppings set up.  Some were in jars right right at the counter instead of off to the side.  It's kind of awkward when the employees just stare at you while you use the toppings from the jars right at the counter.   Overall, I really love the cinnamon bun flavor that no other place in the area has had lately.

I ordered two items for carry-out on 7/28/2013.  I was very disappointed in the quality of my food.  I ordered a grilled chicken quesadilla with chicken and cheese only and a ground beef taco with beef and cheese only.  They messed up both items.  They gave me a shredded chicken with tomatoes and onions in it and it was all liquidity.  Then they put lettuce on my taco.  The beef was burnt.  I took a bite of each item before throwing it all away.  The chips were stale and the salsa were bland and did not taste fresh at all!  What a waste of $15!

I have been here twice now and both times were great!  The food is fresh and tastes wonderful.    Pros: +excellent tasting food +excellent customer service +locally brewed coffee (from Cave Creek) +thick slices of bacon +fresh squeezed orange juice +real maple syrup +you do NOT feel terrible after eating here, like some places!  I felt energized and ready to take on the day  Cons: -may have to wait for a table, but worth it -no biscuits or biscuits & gravy on the menu -would like to see an all-natural sweetener such as Stevia available -would like to see organic ketchup available as a condiment  Those cons are very minor and aren't even a big deal.  I highly recommend this restaurant!

From my personal experiences here, I would recommend the service at Benny's to anyone.  I called around to a couple of automobile repair shops in Tempe to get a quote on a transmission change and an oil change.  Most places, besides Richard from Benny's Auto Repair and Chris from Mile Auto Repair, were negative sounding over the telephone.  However, Richard from Benny's Auto Repair and Chris from Mile Auto Repair, were friendly and went out of their way to check on the required fluids for my desired services and gave me a price quote.  I ended up going with Benny's because the quote was $20 cheaper than Mile Auto Repair...which isn't too much of a difference.  Especially since one automobile shop in town gave me a total quote of $252!  Anyway, Benny's got me in the next day and showed excellent customer service throughout my whole interaction with them.  I received a transmission change and an oil change for exactly $100.85.  That is a great deal!  Check out Benny's if you can!  I will be taking my business in the future to them!

Since my brother was my automobile mechanic when I lived in Indiana, I was worried I wouldn't be able to find an affordable & honest mechanic when I moved to Arizona.  Well, I've been fortunate to have found Benny's Auto Repair & Tire in Tempe, AZ. Benny & his son, Richard, have saved me hundreds of dollars & have been very good to me. My car was scratched recently & the quotes I received were anywhere from $500-$700. Benny fixed this issue for $325 on a weekend when he doesn't even have shop hours! Also, I just got new tires, new front brakes & rotors, my oil changed, & a transmission flush for only $550. If you're looking for an affordable & honest automobile mechanic, try checking out Benny's. Tell them I sent you!

I was impressed with this establishment.  It is located above a sandwich shop in Phoenix.  They had about 20 different craft brews on tap as well.  I ordered the Ivan Burger with bacon cooked medium well.  The burger was very tasty and cooked perfectly.  The burger does not come with pickles so make sure you ask for them.  The burger is also served on a pretzel bun which was actually really good.  The fries were decent but you don't get many of them.  The burger and fries were about $12 ($1 more for bacon) and a craft brew will run you about $6.  The bacon was a little too done for my liking but that was the only flaw.  I recommend going during Happy Hour from 3pm-6pm because you can get $2 off an appetizer and $1.50 off of a draft.  Finally, the best day to go is on Wednesday because they have the Ivan Burger, fries, and a craft brew all  for $10 total.  That is almost 50 percent off the regular price.  Check out this place for a great burger!  It's one of the best places in the Valley for a burger and a brew!

This was a nice establishment. The pizza tasted fresh. The crust is thicker compared to Fired Pie, Pieology, and MOD.  The fresh mozzarella was better here than the shredded mozzarella they offer.  I thought this place was going to have crumbled sausage (like I saw in Yelp photos) but it only had sliced sausage. I received free garlic knots for "checking in" on Yelp.  They also offer a program to receive points for free food. The customer service was great and it was easy to find parking.

The brewers here are very productive.  They are always trying to brew a new and unique beer for their customers and they do a great job.  I've only had a few brews here and so far I really enjoy their Refuge IPA and DC Mountain Double IPA.  This place can get super busy on the weekends so be prepared for that.  I look forward to trying more brews from them and even some items off their food menu.

This is a really cool place to get a brew and some good food.  It does get really busy on the weekends so be prepared for that.  The burger was pretty good but I really liked their tator tots the most.  My favorite brew by them thus far is the Brown Peacoat Porter.  I hope they continue to brew it!  The customer service has just been average, but it has always been really busy both times I've went.

This is a great place to get a pizza for pick-up.  I noticed online it said they deliver.  However, I called and they said they don't deliver.  So, I'm hoping they fix this issues fixed.  I did enjoy the pizza and the customer service was good besides the delivery issue.

By far, this is the best BBQ restaurant I have tried in The Valley.  I go here mainly because of the outstanding brisket.  It is amazing.    I look forward to many trips back and look forward to trying the turkey, chicken, and pulled pork next time I stop in.  You need to get here as early as you can because they often sell out.  The food is always fresh and the customer service is impeccable.  The spicy and regular bbq sauce is awesome as well.  The only thing I don't care for is the side dishes...but the brisket makes up for everything!

This place has a great coffee stout.  I was also impressed with their grilled wings (order them extra crispy). They were great. I've also tried the pretzel nuggets with queso, but I don't think it's worth the $7 they charge. The fries were just average to me.  The brews, the wings, and their great customer service keep me coming back.

I was excited to try this place out because it is close to where I live.  However, everything tasted low quality to me.  The chicken reminded me of the chicken at Subway.  I was expecting tasty grilled chicken.  The pretzel bites were okay but the cheese was not.  I could of had better cheese out of a jar from the grocery store.  Also, the ordering process was kind of awkward because my girlfriend and I weren't sure if they were going to bring the food out or if we needed to go to the counter to pick it up.  Our order wasn't totally correct as well when we got it to the table.

I stopped in because this place is close to me and I wanted a sandwich. I had the flying pig..,turkey breast, applewood smoked bacon, roasted tomatoes, herb spread, & Havarti cheese on sourdough. It was really good. The customer service was great as well.

I went here on a Saturday night. The service was great and no one was hardly in there. I ordered the grilled cheese and it was not very good at all.  The bacon inside wasn't crispy and the bread wasn't very good either.  The fries were average. I tried a red sangria and a white sangria. The red sangria was just average and I didn't like white sangria.  I might come back to try another item on the menu.

One of the best sandwich places I've ever tried.  I frequent the one at Planet Hollywood whenever I'm in Las Vegas. I lived in Tempe and was glad they delivered to me.  Their desserts are good and even preservative-free.

I came to the Vision Center at this Wal-Mart Supercenter and had a really great experience.  I had an exam for contact lenses and Dr. Joel Micheals was very professional, friendly, and helpful.  The Vision Center manager named Lori was also top-notch and her customer service skills were stellar.  I would recommend this Vision Center to anyone who needs an eye exam or needs contact lenses or glasses.

Great tasting donuts and a nice variety. Easy parking, a drive-thru window, and great customer service. They even let me have a few boxes to pull an April Fool's Day prank on my co-workers.

This is a great frozen yogurt spot in Gilbert that is really close to where I currently live.  I really enjoyed their sea salt caramel and their cake batter flavor.  I'm hoping they get an oatmeal cookie flavor as well.  The topping bar here is better than any place I've been too.  It's in the middle and there's plenty of room to get around.

This is a great neighborhood spot close to me.  The customer service is always great and parking is never a problem.  They have lots of t.v.'s for sports fans and even a large patio!  I haven't had much luck with their food. It's just been average at best.

I am going with 2 stars for this apartment complex because of the many move-in problems that I experienced.  On the day I moved in, the apartment wasn't move-in ready! The washer and dryer wasn't installed and it was just sitting in my hallway for a week and I had to move in around it.  The patio had broken pieces of glass on it and the sliding door was broke. The apartment wasn't even cleaned and it was missing sliding closet doors.  It was an absolute nightmare! To make things worse, the key they gave me didn't even work, so I had to wait an hour until they provided a key for me.  Also, I've been at the main office to pick up postal packages and sometimes the door is locked during office hours. I'm taking like over an hour at a time. I'm currently renting an updated unit (no carpet, wood looking floors, nice countertops) for around $1,000 a month. This includes rent, water, trash, sewage, and renter's insurance. The positives for this place is that they have 2 pools (1 is heated), 2 hot tubs, a small fitness center, an outdoor dog area, and the complex is pretty quiet. Also, it's close to many places...downtown Chandler, etc.  I have uploaded pictures of my apartment, but the price is pretty steep for the amount of troubles I've had.

I really enjoyed the pizza here.  To me, it's just as good as Fired Pie.  I still like MOD Pizza the best though...out of all these similar concept pizza spots. I liked the layout of the place. It was very clean and modern and reminded me of the inside of a Chipotle. The customer service was excellent.

I enjoyed this establishment and was impressed with the prices.  I ordered a turkey sandwich on sourdough. It was good. The unsweetened tea was good as well. I did try their sea salted caramel brownie but it was too rich for my liking. I'd like to try to come back to try their pulled pork sandwich, tri-tip chili, and homemade pop tart.  The customer service was excellent.
