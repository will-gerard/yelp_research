Review about this place were right, BIG portions! Off the strip but only about 10 minutes away from the end of the strip. We ordered the Corned Beef Hash breakfast, a pancake, and an omelette The Corned Beef Hash came with potato crisps, very flavorful and tasted just baked, not soggy at all. I ordered the banana bread instead of toast, was pretty tasty! The servers were nice and attentive, only when we paid was there a wait, but no biggie to me. Overall, food was good and the price just as good.

Service is great. The server explained their dishes & didn't just assume we knew what everything was. The food was a little greasy but so good. They served 6 different apps that included pickled radishes, cabbage & boiled peanuts. We ordered the combo & spicy pork, both were delish & filled us up, (Mom, 15 & 5 year old).

Delicious burgers, like the burgers I remember growing up, tasty, juicy and plentiful. I ordered the basic burger with American cheese. The patty was huge and tasty, not dry at all. The buns they use are pretty basic, sesame seed. It did start falling apart towards the end but that may have been because of all the toppings I added. The toppings bar is off to the side so you can add whatever you like and add as little or as much as you like. Their fries, onion rings and fried zucchini were fine, nothing spectacular but weren't bad. CASH ONLY btw!

Love this place! We started with a Caipirinha and a Kierland Margarita. The margarita was just a run of the mill drink but the Caipirinha was delicious! I loved that it was served with an actual sugar cane. As an appetizer we had the Mixto Clasico Ceviche. Definitely not the ceviche I grew up eating! But wow was it tasty. The sweet potato mash gave it a sweet flavor I didn't realize I'd appreciate. The bread is also worth noting, so tasty. The gentlemen placing the rolls at each table was smart enough to only give us 2 rolls! Thank goodness for him! As the main course we had the Churrasco en Tabla, Grilled Asparagus and Maduros Cubanos. The Churrasco is definitely for 2 and comes with 4 proteins and a heated stone to cook the somewhat rare way the meats are served, 3 Chimichurris and salt. Wow, wow, wow is all I can say. The asparagus comes with a side sauce, very good but not needed in my opinion. The maduros, that was like our dessert! As the name implies, they were cooked at the perfect tenderness. I hinted vinegar in the sauce, which I loved, but I may be wrong. Overall, amazing food and service!  We didn't have a reservation and so were seated outside and quite frankly, unless we would've sat at The Rail, I think we lucked out. (That comment will change once our Summer heat actually starts, lol.)

This McDonald's is a hit and miss. Sometimes you have the employees who actually have customer service common sense and some who obviously don't. On May 24 my two teenage kids went in at about 830am and asked for a cup of water and were told that unless they purchased something, they couldn't give them water. Pretty inconsiderate, considering it was 90+ degrees out already. Had they had $, they would likely have purchased a cup of soda instead. Funny thing is that depending on the employee, depends if the customer gets a free cup of water. Thanks older, hispanic, heftier, manager (they didn't catch her name and this is the description they gave me. She had a different colored shirt than the other employees which is why they believe she was the manager).

The atmosphere at this restaurant is upbeat and the entertainment is great. The dessert and service however, left much to be be desired. We had a Cappuccino, Flan and Brazo Gitano. All three were incredibly mediocre. The flan was barely ok and the Brazo Gitano was extremely dry. Both had an overpowering alcohol/liqueur taste. But the service from our server was what left the worst taste of all. Incredibly rude and so aloof. Won't be coming back there again.

Finally made a pit stop here. Chicken and donuts, who would've thunk lol. Donuts are definitely creative. I had a chicken fried combo- 1 leg, 1 breast, 1 wing, (the meal comes with a donut, has to be a standard donut though, there's an upcharge for a premium donut). The chicken was decent, nothing out of this world, in fact, it was a little too crunchy for me. I'd definitely give 3 stars for just the chicken. I got a side of Korean Chile, it was way too salty so instead I just added hot sauce. I ordered with a side of cucumber salad and it was pretty bland. Side servings are VERY small.  I tried several donuts, Pear Plum Yogurt Donut, Apple Fritter, Pistachio Chocolate and a Boston Creme type donut. My favorite was the Boston Creme, the cream didn't taste generic at all. The Pear Plum donut was very moist and dense. The Fritter was nothing special, kind of dry actually and the Pistachio one was also quite dry.  I'll definitely go back for more donuts and for their chicken sandwiches, which apparently are so much better than just their chicken.  Chicken isn't served until after 10:30am. I noticed most sides are small so order more than 1 side if you're extra hungry, (or in my opinion just hungry, that's how small they seemed to me). Although the lines can get long, they move really quickly so don't fret if you see it coming out onto the side. Food also comes out quickly. Pretty limited seating inside but plenty outside.

Disclaimer: I'm not a vegan by any means but I love all foods! So this review is based on my non-vegan's experience...  I had: L8 GREEN CURRY (Green curry with coconut milk, onion, bamboo, bell pepper, eggplant and sweet basil with tofu or chicken and rice) and for dessert: BANANA IN COCONUT CREAM  The Green Curry dish was very hearty and big enough to share. It wasn't so much green, more like yellow curry, but not really an important detail, right? I liked that the tofu wasn't soggy, only done by baking the tofu prior to adding to main dish, very important when using in a soup or broth based dish. Wasn't spicy at all. Soup was't full of the listed veggies, I could've had a bit more.  The Banana in Coconut Cream was very basic but good. The banana was ripe enough to sweeten the dish. Not a pleasant color, in fact if you judge food by how it looks this might turn you off, it's just very colorless, reminded me of cement before it hardens and is very soupy. It has a light taste but only if you share.  Restaurant is open on the weekends and into the evening which is a big plus for those downtown type of nights and weekends. Be prepared to pay for parking since there isn't any free nearby parking.
