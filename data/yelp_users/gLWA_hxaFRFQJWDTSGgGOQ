We had a great time for our anniversary! The fondue was amazing. We went with the endless fondue, and that was a great choice! Delicious!

This place was very good. I got the crispy spicy teriyaki chicken. I liked that it was a piece of chicken that was fried and then sliced. Some Chinese food places do to much breading. It was kind of a panko like crust too. Very good. I am pretty sure they make their own noodles there. I really liked them. It's a great lunch spot with their special. Be expected to pay $2 more to upgrade to the noodles. A little pricey, but I think worth it.

So I finally got around to trying Ted's. It was pretty tasty. I got the white hot which was pretty good. It didn't really have a lot of flavor though. I also got the Chili dog. That was pretty tasty. I wasn't sure about the nacho cheese looking stuff, but it was better then expected. I think next time I will try the polish dog.. The onion rings were delicious. I think I will be back again just for those! The line was pretty long, so be prepared to wait a little. They also get your order before you get to the actual ordering spot, so make sure you know what you want quickly!

Fun little place out in the middle of nowhere. I don't think I would make a detour for this place in the future.. But if you are in the area it isn't to bad. The Onion rings weren't very good. The burgers were pretty tasty and the fries were good. Overall kind of greasy.. But again, not a bad spot if you are in the area..

I got the Roast Beef and Mushrooms with melted provolone on top. I have to say the sandwich was pretty tasty and it was a good price. The only down side on this sandwich was the use of canned mushrooms.. Fresh mushrooms would be so much better!! Come on guys!

Holy Moly... This place is amazing! I used to live in Missouri, and this BBQ is right on par with the midwest. From beginning to end, this meal was fantastic. We had the platter with different meat choices and everything was so good. The baby back ribs were falling off the bone, and they had so much flavor! Every side was amazing as well. They end it off with some delicious little donuts that are complimentary. This place is my go to now for BBQ.

Anytime I can find a Yoshinoya I am there!! I am kind of a proponent for this place.. I don't know exactly why i love it so much, but I seek them out when I can find them. We don't have them in AZ, so I usually go out of my way when I am out of state to find one. You have to get the chicken and beef combo bowl. So good.. I am hungry for it right now!

Oh man... We sure do love this place! They have great food and also a great environment! Their steaks are delicious. I don't know what seasoning they put on there, but it sure does give it an amazing flavor. It's great going in the winter time and having a fire and roasting some mallows. The kids def love this place. The music is great too. It's definitely worth the drive out to San Tan Valley.

We were at the Bass Pro Shop so we decided to eat at their so the kids could check out the big fish tanks. Firstly, the decor in the restaurant is awesome. It's almost worth eating there just for that.. The food on the other hand.. It was okay.. Their bread is weird. It has sugar caked on the top.. Not really a fan of it. We had the Alligator and it was actually pretty tasty. I got the cajun pasta and it was pretty flavorless.. My wife got a salad and she said it was alright.. The prices were a little high, not really worth it for the food we got. We probably won't be back.

You can't go wrong with a little Cracker Barrel. I got the chicken fried steak and it was great. My friend had the pecan pancakes and I don't really like pecans.. But they were tasty!

I had to try this place out because of the reviews. It has a very trendy vibe and it feels like you are in a pub in England. The pasty was pretty good, but that wine sauce is amazing.. I dipped my fries in that shiz. ;) The fries were great too. They had jalapenos on top that added some great heat. Overall a pretty good find. I shall be back.

This is a great local breakfast place! The Chicken Fried Steak and Biscuits and Gravy were great! The kids loved their Mickey shaped pancakes. I am glad to know this place exists! We will definitely be back soon.

Wow.. All I can say is pubes in my baked potato..   We came to Dillon's after we went to zoo. We had the Groupon deal and on the deal it says one Groupon per transaction. I called a ahead of time to make sure I could do separate checks for me and my wife.   Anyway, we get to our table and the kids are tired and ornery. We tell the waitress we will do four separate checks between us and our friends. The waitress seemed annoyed.. We tried to be quick with ordering and knowing what we wanted. Apparently we were not nice enough because like I said earlier.. I got pubes in my food.   The manager came over and offered to make me a new plate.. Really?? I just got pubes in my food. No thanks!   He offered nothing else besides that.   I am disgusted with this place and would advise you to stay away..  This is at a Zoo.. Expect ornery kids. I called ahead and asked about the Groupon deal.. The customer service there does not exist!  I am still sick to my stomach thinking about this..

You pay to get in to pay to get the most expensive samples I have ever bought.. I even got free tickets to this mess and I wouldn't have gone if I would have known it was set up that way.. No thanks!
