The service was kind and friendly, fairly efficient. The restaurant smelled slightly like sulfur. The bean and cheese burrito was less bean and more liquid brown and some cheese flakes. Tortillas tasted stale. The guacamole was just chilled avocado with cilantro, fairly bland. Chips were good though.

The Mild Basil Fried Rice with Fried Tofu was to die for!!! I'm a bit of a picky vegetarian eater, but I've been looking for good Thai restaurants for sixteen years and this is by far my favorite. Everything was delicious, the place was very clean, and the service was fast and friendly. Staff were very polite, and the atmosphere was very nice.

I have been coming here for years and I've had a great experience every time! The staff are always friendly and the menu is very accommodating for practitioners of alternative vegetarian/ vegan diets. I'd highly recommend the Evil Jungle Princess with Tofu and Brown Rice, it's delicious. Good music, good atmosphere, good food, what more could you ask for? By far my favorite Asian restaurant in Scottsdale, I recommend Ling and Louie's to all my friends for dinner group ups.

Hands down the BEST breakfast place in Fountain Hills! Location is very convenient, the food was very filling. Portions were very large and the staff are very friendly. We had an impatient little one with us, but our waitress was very understanding and joked around with us. Made me want to become a regular and a member of the lovely Flapjacks community . The baked pancakes were to die for and the Napa Omelette was well cooked and delicious, so glad we could find it through Yelp! We will definitely be returning. My only complaint would be that the food takes a while to come out.

Very good authentic Latin cuisine! Normally, it's quite difficult to find good Latin American food anywhere, especially if you're a vegetarian in Fountain Hills! Sofritas is quickly becoming my favorite proximity based restaurant, I've always been a big supporter of local businesses, and this place is definitely in my top five places to dine in FH. Staff are always very accommodating, the Guacamole and Hummus dishes are DELICIOUS! Food comes out very quickly as well, and the beautiful rustic crosses on the wall add to a wonderful Latin atmosphere. The place is beautifully kept and always very clean, 10/10, would definitely recommend!

Penne alla Vodka was very filling and delicious! The sauce was excellently prepared, and the noodles were just the right texture. The bruschetta was made with some fairly fresh tomatoes, but the bread tasted smokey, possibly slightly burnt. Just okay. Garlic knots were great flavor for a good price. Will definitely be coming back!
