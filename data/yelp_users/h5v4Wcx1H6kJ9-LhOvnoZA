Ive been to the Strip House in Houston and LOVED it. The Strip House in Vegas did not disappoint from a food perspective. Everything was delicious and prepared perfectly. The 2 star rating comes from the fact that I found the service to be less than stellar. Our waiter seemed annoyed by questions about the menu. He argued about splitting our checks. He wasn't terribly responsive to the table's needs. I probably won't go back to this restaurant if/when I go back to Las Vegas. If I Want to go to the Strip House, I'll make the trip to Houston.

I didn't have dinner here. I had dessert and espresso.I was with 2 companions and we all loved what we ordered. I had the donuts with apricot rum pastry cream which were crispy and chewy and delightful. The pastry cream was a perfect compliment to my espresso. My table mates ordered the panna cotta and a trifle composed of ricotta, berries and what I think was some sort of honeyed cake. All items were well prepared and tasty. The service was attentive but not obnoxious. Next time I'm in Vegas, I will totally hit them up for dinner.

yum! We hit up Pink's on our first night in Vegas. Sure, it was 30 bucks for a couple of hot dogs and some fries but it's Vegas. I had a dog smothered in Chili, cheese, onions, mustard and jalapenos. Boyfriend had the polish dog. Coming from Central Texas, we expect yumminess when it comes to hot dogs and sausage. Pink's did not disappoint. Sure the hot dog was topped with all sorts of delicious stuff but the hot dog itself was also quite tasty. Good stuff!
