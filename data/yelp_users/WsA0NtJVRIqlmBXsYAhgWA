I've been to the Gelato Spot next-door countless times, but for some reason I never stepped in here.  I have been missing out!!  When I walked in at 2pm, all the tables were full but there was no line at the counter. The cheerful barista asked what she could get for me and when I said I wasn't sure, she not only told me to take my time, but pulled out laminated sheets listing their syrups and teas. That intuitive customer service set things off right from the get-go. I noticed they had one of my favorite (yet hard to come-by) flavors- praline, and ordered a decaf iced praline latte. The barista made the drink quickly, in spite of her accidental initial pull of regular espresso, which she noticed right away and fixed. She also asked my milk preference which I liked because let's face it girls, some days are skim days and others are 2% days and it helps to have someone remind me of that. :)  The latte was satisfying. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it was made well and wasn't overwhelmingly sweet like the lattes they usually serve at Starbucks (this coming from a sugar fanatic!). The pitcher of water and water cups they have out with the cream and sugar is a nice touch that I'd like to see in every coffee shop.   The decor is sort of rustic with burlap coffee sacks above the door and local art on the walls. The atmosphere, which can't really be pinned down to one thing, is welcoming and relaxed and I felt like I could hide away for hours there.   There were a few negatives. The first was the mess of a baked goods display. I'm sure it looked great at opening, but by the time I was there, it was disheveled, half empty and didn't look like it had been tidied up all day. Typically I ignore the food offerings at coffee-shops, but I skipped lunch today and could have been persuaded to drop a few dollars if I'd seen anything remotely interesting. The other thing is that they have a drink refrigerator containing water bottles, juices and other bottled drinks for sale. It's so loud!! It cycles on and off, but when it's on, it can be pretty distracting.   I will definitely come back to this place, especially as the weather improves and all the outdoor seating becomes a viable option. Now I just need to silence those evil thoughts that tell me it's acceptable to get a gelato within the same hour as getting a sugary latte...

If you enjoy wine-bars and you don't fall in love with Postino, you're crazy!  The first time I walked into Postino, I felt like I'd stepped into a different world. Having lived in NYC for a while, I became a bit spoiled and was pleasantly surprised to find Postino comparable to places I loved out there!   Nighttime is the best time to go as it's dim, loud and full of energy. Postino is one of my favorite places to go for a light dinner and drinks with good friends year-round; however, on a fall or spring night, when they have all the doors and windows open onto the patio, it's perfection.  As many have mentioned, the bruschetta is great. It's a good option for an appetizer or sharing for a main dish, especially if you'd rather focus on filling up with wine than food. ;) The grilled cheese appetizer is tasty, but a pretty small portion. If you're looking for a small compliment to wine, they've got a "cheese course" and a meat and cheese "plate". The cheese course comes with 3 different cheeses that they switch up frequently. It's a pretty decently sized dish, but the last time I ordered it, the "fruit" they mentioned on the menu was basically just dried apricots, cranberries and nuts. It wasn't bad, but with the crunchy bread it came with, there were too many dry things on one plate for my liking! If you like olives, I'd recommend splurging on the $5 olive bowl. It's a generous portion of mixed olives that will not disappoint.   My all-time favorite item at Postino is the "Prosciutto with Brie" Panini, on Ciabatta bread, with salad. The sandwich is soft prosciutto layered with brie, arugula and figs, drizzled with a little balsamic and olive oil and served on a super crunchy ciabatta roll. If this was the only item on the menu, I'd still make the 15 mile drive to order it. The sandwich is big enough to share, but I love it enough to eat the whole thing and suffer the consequences later. :) All of the paninis come with potato chips or salad. Rarely would I choose salad as a side, but I actually look forward to this salad almost as much as the sandwich. It's romaine lettuce, pine nuts, crumbled feta and a very light oil dressing (from what I can gather).   The two negatives, which is what drops it from 5 stars to 4 are the following: The service is often lacking. There are some really nice, attentive servers and there are some rather pretentious servers (which isn't unheard of at a wine-bar). It's really hit or miss, but I take it with a grain of salt and don't let it deter me from going. After all, a pretentious server can become great material for dinner-time laughs.   The second negative is the parking situation. This is an issue with any of the many LA Grande Orange establishments located on that corner. Pretty much any time you go there, you will have trouble finding parking. They do offer valet, but call me cheap, I'd rather not HAVE to pay for valet.   To make a long story short (I know, too late), go to Postino if you're looking for an experience you're unlikely to find anywhere else in Phoenix.

I came to Angel Sweet a few years ago when I was a virgin. A gelato virgin that is. That first time was everything I could have hoped for and far more. Unfortunately since it's all the way in Chandler and I'm all the way in northeast Phoenix, our long-distance relationship faltered.   In the last few years many gelato places have sprung up around the valley and although I'm thankful to have a Gelato Spot a mile away from my house, I've never gotten over my first love and doubt I ever will.   The taste, texture and presentation of the fresh-made-daily gelatos at Angel Sweet are so delicious. The portions are pretty comparable to what you'd get at Gelato Spot. I've never left unsatisfied.   The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is the atmosphere. The interior is simple and sweet, but because it's usually busy, it's hard to relax while sitting in a table that's right next to a crowd of people. The business is in a strip mall that while clean, is a strip mall. There's nothing enticing to look at and nowhere fun to walk around to. If Angel Sweet were sitting atop a hill, overlooking the city (or maybe just in a place with a few trees and flowers) it would truly be heavenly. ;)

Village Tavern isn't terrible, but it was oh-so-forgetable!   The first time I went here I got the French Onion soup and although it was more cheese than I'd normally like, it was pretty good. The main dish I got, the Shrimp Risotto, was far from impressive. I've had better in a frozen microwave meal.   The second time I went, which was last weekend, I got the Marinated Flank Steak with a side of potatoes Au gratin. The steak was cut very thick for flank steak and was pretty chewy. The potatoes in the Au gratin weren't cooked all the way through and were just lacking any flavor. The vegetables on the side aren't worth mentioning.   The service both times I went was fine. Nothing too exciting, nothing to entice me to come back. As for the restaurant itself,  it's a nice looking place, but the food just doesn't live up to it. Maybe myself and those I've gone with have been ordering the wrong menu items, but I continue to not be wowed.

What can I say that hasn't already been said? Lux is a breath of fresh air in a city cluttered with boring chain coffee joints. From the modern, eclectic aesthetics to the masterfully prepared drinks (including the yummy homemade, scoop-able whipped cream!) and the laid-back staff, Lux is always a treat.   A life-long Phoenician, I've always had the "stay away from strangers" mentality. When I first went to Lux I was dismayed that even at a "slow" time I was forced to sit either on the same couch or at the same table as a stranger. Now I have assimilated to the environment that provides ample opportunity to easily strike up a conversation with fellow Lux-goers. Thank you Lux for melting this cold-stranger-averse exterior!   The only reason I cannot give Lux 5 stars is the lack of outdoor comforts. The picnic-style tables stand in stark contrast to the comfortable seats and atmosphere found indoors. On a beautiful spring/fall night (which I can only dream of at this time of year), I want to sit outdoors in comfortable seats, with a good cup of coffee and enjoy great conversation. Work with me Lux!   In summation, if you like great coffee (or yummy baked goods!) and a fun, energetic atmosphere, Lux is the place for you. :)

This is my favorite Indian restaurant ANYWHERE.   Last summer I was in the Pittsburgh area visiting a friend of mine that is from India. He took me to what he said was the best and most authentic Indian food in the country. Udupi is better!!  The environment leaves much to be desired,  but the food is amazing. A must have is the Paper Dosai Masala. It's a HUGE crispy crepe that has a filling (the masala has a potato filling) and it comes with sambar and chutney to dip it in. The presentation is as wonderful as the flavor. As evidence, the last time I ordered it, the tables on either side of us asked what it was!  The pricing could be a little cheaper at dinner. I have yet to make it to the lunch buffet so I'm not sure how it compares.   All in all, if you're looking for great Indian food, this is the place to be!

Whenever I venture out to Cave Creek I feel like I'm entering an entirely different world. Sitting on the front patio with a good cup of coffee, it isn't even necessary to bring a book or a friend with all the local gossip in the air.  There's never a shortage of retired cowboys and bikers supplying entertainment.   Cave Creek Coffee Company is a rare find. The interior is cozy, with many over-sized leather chairs and couches in the front room and back. Some background music would make the atmosphere perfect. I've never eaten at the wine bar, but I've been through there during dinner time and there was so much energy in the room. I could tell people were really enjoying themselves.   If you have a chance to see a show here, Do IT!! Last December I saw John Corbett (of Northern Exposure, Serendipity & Sex and the City fame) here and it was so great! They've got some small bleacher seating, tables and in the winter time a fire pit going. It's a rather intimate setting.   I'd be at C4 all the time if it wasn't 15 miles from my house. :)

I'm happy to say that a few weeks ago I ventured back down to Tempe for some pasties and was pleasantly surprised at the level of service I received. It was like night and day from the first time. The server was so sweet, so attentive and she really couldn't have been any better!   I got the chicken tikka masala pasty and it was delicious, but a little too spicy for my taste buds. My bf and I each got a shepherd's pie to go and had them for lunch the next day. They give them to you partially baked, recommending you cook them the rest of the way right before eating. As we both ate them at work we cooked them that night and just re-heated them in the microwave the next day. Even reheated in a microwave they were so good!   Special props go out to the amazing server that bumped my rating up to 4 stars. :)

A chain restaurant or a local breakfast joint?? I couldn't figure it out the first time I went here. The design of the menu and restaurant is much like a chain restaurant, but with more vibrant colors and a certain energy to it. However, the service and food are indicative of a local, small town diner.   There's nothing better than sitting down and already having your own pitcher full of fresh ice water w/lemon slices setting on your table! I love little touches like that! The coffee is always fresh and served with heavy cream - indulgent yes, worth it, absolutely!  The Blueberry Pancakes (with their delicious blueberry compote) are the best I've had. On a side note, if you get regular pancakes along with another meal, they'll give you a side of the blueberry compote free of charge. I highly recommend doing so! The Strawberry Shortcake Flapjacks are sweet and may make you feel like you've ordered dessert for breakfast, but it's ok to be naughty every once in a while. ;) The Classic Eggs Benedict (which I subbed regular bacon for the Canadian bacon it comes with) wasn't the best I've had, but  I give it an 8 out of 10! The hash browns have always been cooked perfectly - extra crispy!  I've never felt rushed at Butterfield's and I think that's rare for a busy breakfast place. The service is great all-around and the food is consistently satisfying. Yum! :)

I've tried the pizza in the past and it was to be honest, nothing to write home about. I try not to judge restaurants on the first go around though so on my lunch break today, I decided to give it another try.   They have a few different lunch specials, but their pasta lunch specials include the choice of pasta, a side salad and a drink (iced tea, coffee or an organic soda). I opted for the Eggplant Parmigiana with a Caesar salad and OMG, it was delicious!! I would consider myself a connoisseur of eggplant/chicken parmigiana, very picky to say the least and their version more then exceeded my expectations.   It takes a bit longer for the dish to come out of the kitchen as they bake each serving under the broiler to get the cheese all hot and bubbly, but it's well worth the wait. With Italian food it's so easy to overeat but Picazzo's has done a great job with portioning- enough to satisfy, but not enough to fill you with regret later on...   For a drink I ordered the Lemonade Cooler, which is a concoction of Rain (organic) Vodka, Chambord and lemonade. Yummmmm! It was strong enough to wash away the stress of my busy morning at work, but not enough to prevent me from kicking butt when I got back to the office.   As my lunch special came with a drink and I didn't have time to have a post-meal cup of coffee, the waitress offered to give me an iced coffee in a to-go cup. The coffee comes pre-sweetened (with natural, organic sweetener I believe...), but the waitress was thoughtful enough to bring over the sugar packets and a bit of creamer. With a splash of creamer and a quick stir, I left Picazzo's feeling satisfied, happy and ready to conquer the rest of my day. :)

Ten o'clock on a Friday night and there were only 15 people in sight as I walked into Red Bar. To make matters worse, every person in there had 10+ years on me.   The design is in line with the rest of The Mondrian Hotel- trendy, modern, and sort of ecclectic. The small room of the Red Bar is stark with white floors and walls, red furniture and red lighting. It's not completely innovative, but not something you find very often in Phoenix.   Unfortunately, the design of the room did not lend itself to a positive experience. Maybe it's the fact that it's located in a hotel or the fact that the hotel is located far off from the main old town drag; but whatever the reason, the lame atmosphere was enough to keep me from staying long enough to have a drink. =/

I don't live in Scottsdale. I don't have much in common with people that live in Scottsdale (no money, no little dog with blinged out collar, and no BMW) but I do enjoy the ample seating and courteous staff of this Starbucks location. There are an abundant number of comfy seats (10 I think), regular seating (at least 20 seats) and a huge outside seating area (with at least 10 tables), more than any other Starbucks I've been too. It's usually pretty busy during the day, but in the evening it's the perfect place to study or meet a few friends.   Although I usually just get an iced tea or water, the times I've ordered other drinks they were well-made and to my specifications. On the one occasion they forgot to make my drink, they promptly gave me a free drink coupon and apologized profusely.   All that being said, it's still a Starbucks and if you're afraid of the big bad corporation, feel free to steer clear. ;) Being in a part of town where there aren't any indy coffee shops, I have little choice. But, if you're feeling brave, and in the mood to have a cup of joe in a nice location, Starbucks at Kierland is a good choice!
