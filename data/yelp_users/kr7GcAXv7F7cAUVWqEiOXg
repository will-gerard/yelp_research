Simple, yet amazing burgers. Unpretentious and thoroughly bullshit-free. If you want one of the best burgers you'll ever have the privilege - yes, privilege - of eating, Giant Hamburgers is the place to make that happen. Can't wait to go back and try a shake!

In order to have - as their jingle claims - MORE than just great wings, don't you first need to HAVE great wings? Absolutely awful food, terrible service, and a gross dirty restaurant.   And keeping an eye on me, my wife, and my two little girls to make sure we're not watching some stupid MMA thing, otherwise you'll be back to collect your cover charge??? Man, eff all that nonsense. Never again. Ever.

Great beer selection, possibly the best in the eastern part of the basin! Good prices and a nice array of 5-gallon kegs for my fridge. Plus, they'll even fill your CO2. (Total Wine doesn't do that!) The only drawback, if you can even consider this a drawback, is that there's SO MUCH BEER that sometimes the tiny, crowded aisles can be difficult to navigate. I can only imagine the destruction Costanza's puffy Gore-Tex coat would cause...

Easily my favorite (and therefore obviously the BEST) dive bar in the area. Great beers, awesome bartenders, one of the best jukeboxes around, and a nice collection of DVDs...James is rad, too.

In a vacuum, this place would only get 3 or 4 stars. But, when comparing it to similar places, I have to give Amado's a full, five-star rating. Great burritos, chili rellenos, and they know how to do a fish taco the right way. Far superior to any of the fill-in-the-berto's.

I'd been wanting to check this place for quite some time and I finally got the chance last night (Sunday 9/8) as I was there to see an old friend off who is moving away.   (It's 8 p.m. and fairly packed. The douche quotient is also a bit higher than I expected.)   I was a little underwhelmed with the tap selection, especially when Tops is known for their stellar array of wonderful and varied beers, but I was nonetheless able to find something I'd been dying to try - the Lips of Faith Coconut Curry. A customer was sitting at the bar directly in front of me and overheard me mentioning to my friend that that's what I was going to order. He suggested sampling it first. While the request for a sample was met with some 'tood from the bartender, it was the right call  - not something I'd want a whole pint of. For this sample, I was punished and forced to wait 12 minutes before the bartender decided he had absolutely nothing else with which to fake being busy and he was practically forced to approach me again. This time, I ordered a Prescott Heroes 19 - sample not required. I love brown ales and this was decent enough, but also nothing special.   At precisely 8:30, the lights dimmed, the volume on the TVs went up, and everyone except my two friends and I had shut the fuck up. I turn around to notice everyone staring up at a TV. Breaking Bad. "Oh," my friend turns to me and says, "it's one of THOSE kind of bars." Because I didn't know conversation during Breaking Bad was strictly verboten, we continued speaking, albeit in a most subdued tone. Dude sitting next to the sample-suggesting gentleman and looking like he'd be more comfortable reading comic books at home in his mommy's basement actually turned around and shushed us! He fucking shushed us!! Are you kidding me???? That was it...time to slug our beers and go elsewhere.

It's hard to be consistently disappointed when you're already expecting mild disappointment, but you've managed to do just that Papa John's. Orders jacked up more than once; deliveries running 15 minutes late like it's your job... But tonight was the last straw. Almost an hour late for mediocre (at best), middle-of-road, national chain pizza on a Tuesday (meaning no major pizza consuming televised sporting events) evening - horseshit! I'm done with you. When I want to be disappointed in shitty pizza, I'll use your location on Mesa and Brown.

As recently as a couple months ago, this was one of my favorite coffee places - for both convenience and quality of beverage. Now it's simply awful and I think I'm done with them. Their dirty chai was among the best and their iced coffee was delicious. Today's dirty chai was the second-worst I've ever had and Jessica's two shots over ice tasted like cold vomit. Took them back in and, after implying disbelief that something may have been wrong, I instead got two large black cold brews. Even those were awful - thin, weak, poor tasting, and shaken (leaving nearly half the cup coffee-less). Who shakes cold brew??!? Service has also gotten worse. They move at a snail's pace and can only seem to do one task at a time. I could occasionally deal with slow service - if my drinks actually tasted at least average. But anymore, this place is just awful. Sorry guys. I used to love you.

I should have known better. Or at least expected less. Pork was extremely bland and hush puppies were so dense they were barely cooked. Mac-n-cheese, however, was decent enough.

Although I'm able to save some decent money by shopping here, I only do so because it's my nearest grocery store. I absolutely despise shopping at this location. Never more than two lanes open while the lines of customers continually back up into the aisles...No self check-out lanes...Employees too afraid to say, "Look, you've got 73 items. This lane is for express check-out of 15 items or less."  And what's with the employee named Kenton? I went in this morning to purchase a few Valley Metro passes. I approached the customer service desk where I heard him say, "Damn! Somebody won." He told me I couldn't buy any passes because nobody would be in until 8 o'clock. Well then, Kenton...what the hell were you doing behind the customer service desk scanning your lottery tickets?????  If there were a more feasible option, trust me - I'd use it.

Down to 1 measly star now. I see you've gotten rid of shopping baskets - allegedly under the guise of limiting shoplifting. What you've done however, is limit SHOPPING.   I usually know what I need and can make it through the aisles grabbing my items quickly. Of course, due to the fact there's usually only two lanes open, check-out is where things bog down. Now, with shopping carts being the only option, check-out slows to an absolute crawl.   I'm not going to fill my cart with more groceries simply because it's the only option you now offer. In fact, quite the opposite. I bought less than what I had wanted my last visit and I expect that trend to continue - if I continue to shop there at all.

To anyone thinking of moving into the townhomes of Eastbrook Stratford Place in Mesa, AZ please consider the safety of your pets and children. Eastbrook Stratford Place has no issue with a dog who has killed (because its owner didn't latch the gate) living not only in the complex - but right next to the playground.  A neighbor's leashed dog was snatched from his walker's hands by a dog living next to the playground. The victim was taken to the killer's porch where he was abused like a ragdoll until he was decapitated. Later that evening, Mesa Animal Control released the killer dog back to its owner and continues to live feet from the playground.  If you think this is cool and I should just shut the fuck up, please do nothing. If you think that's some fucked up shit, please e-mail property manager Merlene Faust at merlenef@brownmanagement.com or call her at (480) 539-1396 and let her know that shit ain't cool.  If you need any other reasons not to rent or buy here, let me know - I'll be happy to provide you with several more.
