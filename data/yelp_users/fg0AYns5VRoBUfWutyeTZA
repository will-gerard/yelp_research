This was our first time to this place and it was great!!!   We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday evening and the place was packed.  We were seated right away and the waitress was there within in a couple of minutes for our drink order.  She was back within a few minutes with our drinks and we ordered.  She was back again within a few minutes with our food.  I couldn't believe how fast the food came out of that kitchen and piping hot.  If you are looking for a good Mexican meal, with good service then this is the place for you.  Don't expect fancy, as this is a very casual restaurant with good food and fast service!

What a joke this office is. I called to make an appointment and the person I spoke with gave me every reason to not see this doctor and not one reason I should see her. After few minutes of meaningless conversation and excuses from the woman I was speaking with, I decided to pass.  I wrote the doctor an email to let her know that her office staff is driving patients away from he not to her.  I did this as a professional courtesy as I'm married to a physician and thought she should know. No response from the doctor, so she doesn't care either. My advice to anyone interested in her services is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, find someone has the brains to hire a decent office staff because if she doesn't care to do that, she won't care about you.

My husband and found this place a few months ago.  The food was great so, we returned several times.  It wasn't until our last three trips that it all turned sour for us.  The service was slow and I mean no refills on drinks, food came out after long time etc.  What irritated me the most was our last visit.  The place was busy as usual and we waited to order drinks, then our food and then NOTHING.  The waiter never came back!!!  We found out later he walked off the job with two other servers.  Our food came out and it was cold.  Then we needed drink refills and nobody came by the table.  Then we just wanted our check as we had friends with us and their was no service.  My husband finally flagged another guy down, after an hour of waiting and asked for a bill.  NOTHING!!! It wasn't until we were ready to walk out that he said to the supervisor at the hostess stand
