I highly recommend trying the pizza muffins (both the original and the pepperoni). Unfortunately, our experience was overshadowed by EXTREMELY poor service. And on the night we had out of town guests? We won't be back...

Walked in to the sight of the hostess and all the wait staff texting on their phones. Bartender said we could seat ourselves. Waited for about 15 minutes- didn't even get waters. There was more staff on hand than patrons, so there was no reason for any kind of wait. Poor service, total lack of professionalism... Went to the Mexican grill next door and had drinks in less than 3 minutes. I suggest going there instead!

Pretty cool place in Gilbert for breakfast. Fresh ingredients, open kitchen and a LONG line. I recommend splitting the breakfast quesadilla (it's very filling). And if the line discourages you, look forward to the unlimited coffee refills.

Nice property, but the front office needs some SERIOUS customer service training. I cannot believe that Mark Taylor continues to employ people with such bad attitudes. I don't even like going to the office to pick up packages because I know it will be a frustrating experience. Also, per the previous reviews, maintenance requests take several days to get addressed.

These guys do solid work at reasonable prices. They are consistently $25 - $100 bucks cheaper than the competition.

Grilled wings! They're awesome. This is a good place for HH specials / to meet up with coworkers or friends.

Below average Mexican food at best. And $6 for chips and guacamole? Unless you go to Chandler High, skip this place.

Awesome place to take out-of-town guests. A great variety of brews and a RIDICULOUS Salmon BLT! All of their locations get crowded, so they must be doing something right!

Have you ever experienced above and beyond (and completely unexpected) service? That's what we experienced at Pita Jungle on Sunday. Hillary our waitress was probably the most knowledgeable waitress I have ever, EVER been served by. This girl knew the ENTIRE menu top to bottom.   We ordered drinks- she had a better suggestion ("do you like IPAs? let me give you a sample of something local we just got in").   We ordered the mussels- she mentioned the shrimp and the scallops as her favorites.   Hillary guided us through a wonderful and unexpected dining experience.   We will be back just to sit in her section!

My parents love coming here when they're in town. There is almost always a wait, so I highly recommend making reservations. The service is always good and the bbq... well, its pretty delicious. You can't go wrong with the St. Louis style ribs or the Pulled Pork- the Brisket, however, was a little dry on our last visit. You will definitely have left overs, so sharing isn't a bad idea. ****4 Stars.

Aw, man! We had such high hopes for this place. Came in to celebrate a special night- seated promptly, received menus and water... and then it was all DOWNHILL from there. The food was decent, but the service was basically non-existent. We ordered a bottle of wine and the waiter placed it on the table (no bucket, no ice)- 20 minutes went by and he finally brought bread (oh, and ice- too late for our room temperature Riesling!) Food came out "warm", not hot. And then we waited another 20 minutes after we finished for boxes and our bill. We won't be back because of the service- or lack thereof.

I have never had a bad meal here. The only downside to this place is the wait time on the weekends (but that's not their fault). My go-to is the protein power pancakes (wheat pancakes topped with granola and bluberries). They are perfect before or after a long weekend run/workout. If you're feeling a little more adventurous (or this is your cheat meal), go for one of the skillets with a side of cinnamon roll pancakes.... it is to die for. Nothing but *****5 Stars.

Went to Costco last night around 7:45 to pick up a few things. As I was finishing up (around 8:20), I turned the corner where the fruits and veggies are to grab some carpet cleaner from the back. One of the employees (based on the name tag, some sort of assistant manager), told me "we're closed back here, what are you looking for?"... me: (confused, looking at watch) "carpet cleaner"... his response: "oh we don't have any of that annnddd we're CLOSED".   WOW- look, I understand that your store closes at 8:30, but not every person gets out of work at exactly 5PM during the week. PLUS- I overpaid for an "executive" membership that I didn't ask for in the first place (I wanted the $55 one, but the guy signed me up for the $115 executive membership and I didn't find out until I checked my account online the next day- oh well, not worth the fight)... But now this?   Costco, take a page out of Nordstrom Rack's book- if a customer walks in to their store 1 minute before close, they let them shop UNTIL THEY ARE DONE SHOPPING. Don't close up sections of your store while customers are inside just to save a whole 10 minutes on your commute home.   And to the rude assistant manager: dude... put a smile on. Everyone has bad days (I get it), but a smile and a positive attitude goes a long ways (especially when you work in customer service).

Absolutely horrible. Just horrible! If you decide to sign up with this poor excuse for cable or Internet service, be prepared to get a bill for a different and higher amount each month. Top that off with the worst customer service in the industry and more bad reviews than I care to read through and you have COX COMMUNICATIONS! I'd rather just go without than to deal with them. I'd give them zero stars if I could.

Panda Express is a consistent, fast food Chinese option. I always go for the steamed vegetables in place of lo mein or rice. The orange chicken is good when it's fresh and they just introduced these new short ribs... they are delicious! ****4 Stars.

Really cool concept- they use local ingredients (some picked right outside of their front door). We went for breakfast and had the a) meat and potatoes and b) chicken and mushroom scrambles. These were BIG portions, so bring your appetite.

We had the PERFECT Sunday brunch here. Beautiful outside patio + great weather + no wait = I liked this place within the first 3 minutes of arriving. And the food? The red velvet pancakes were magical- why hasn't anybody every thought of this fantastic idea before? Fluffy, sweet (but not overwhelming) and the perfect serving size- the lemon buttery syrup it comes with just makes them melt in your mouth.   The biggest surprise with how reasonable the prices were for North Scottsdale- 2 entrees + mimosas for right around $30.   Great job Herb Box! We're looking forward to checking out your Old Town location.

This place is sooo good! Featured on several food network shows, Sweet Republic is a "must eat" when visiting PHX/Scottsdale. They have some interesting flavors for the adventurous, ice cream foodie connoisseur (I tried both the Sweet Corn and the Avacado Bacon Habanero flavors). I ended up settling on a classic ice cream sandwich with Madagascar  Vanilla (between two chocolate chip cookies). This place deserves ***** 5 Stars!

MMM... lobster tacos! I'm here at least once a month for lunch with coworkers. I always get a lobster taco and a shrimp taco on whole wheat tortillas with a side of chips and guac. Good service, good prices. ****4 Stars for lunch.

Something so simple done unbelievably well. First time? Try the Oggie (The Traditional Pasty) with steak, potatoes, onion and a side of red wine gravy- DON'T YOU DARE GET KETCHUP INSTEAD! If you want something a little more southwest, the Carne Adovada is RIDICULOUS. They also have a great variety of local beer on tap.

Had a really great lunch here. The place is VERY unassuming from the outside, but the food AND service is spot on. We split a salad and a pizza- with 2 glasses of wine... it came out to a very reasonable price. I definitely recommend this spot if you're in the area!

Great place to grab frozen yogurt in Chandler! The staff was very welcoming and the toppings were fresh- plus they have a Ghirardelli chocolate flavor. Only downside? They only have about 6 flavors of frozen yogurt to choose from.

This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in N Scottsdale. It was featured on Triple D and I highly recommend any of the entrees that were featured on the show. I also like the "chicken of the coup" which consists of biscuits, gravy and eggs in a bowl. You also have to try their salsa! I have to buy a new bottle of it to take home every time we go for breakfast. Only side note- it's a little pricey for breakfast  ($10 - $15 per entree). Still worth the trip! ****4 Stars.

Hot, delicious donuts available 24/7? Bosa Donuts, you had me at hello! I went for the classic glaze with chocolate milk and my partner-in-crime ordered a chocolate sprinkle with strawberry milk. Total cost = $5 and change and a perfect end to our night! *****5 Stars.

Really happy to have found this spot in Mesa. The rice was done well and the FILET MIGNON (cooked medium) was by far the dish of the night! Be ready to down some saki and take part in a birthday chant every 15 minutes- it's going to be a fun night!

JD hit this review right on the head. If you're a big golf fan and not a freshmen in college looking to drink your face off, this is NOT the place you want to spend Super Bowl weekend. More people come to party than they do to watch golf. I would recommend attending this thing during the week (Saturday had record attendance at 178,000+ which meant spending an hour to get in and an hour getting out of this place). Overall, we had a good time though.   If you're planning on coming next year, here's a few tips: 1) pay for reserved parking- the course is at least a mile from the parking lot and if you do this, they will transport you back and forth in a charter bus, 2) COME EARLY- otherwise you will spend 45 minutes waiting in line for a bracelet that is REQUIRED to order a drink (your ID alone will not suffice), 3) wear sunscreen and drink a lot of water- the weather was suppose to be in the high 60s / low 70s... it felt like it was closer to 90 and 4) BRING CHAIRS AND SET UP SHOP AT YOUR FAVORITE HOLE- you don't want to fight this crazy crowd following 1 player from hole to hole. You won't get to see or enjoy anything. By doing this, you won't have to fight for a good view and you can sit back, relax, drink a beer and see all the players go through.   We salvaged our time and will try again next year, 2 Stars ** for the WMPO in 2013.

This place makes some solid burgers. I ordered the Thunderbird (not your traditional burger) with a lettuce bun and truffle fries. YOU HAVE TO GET THE TRUFFLE FRIES! They also have a delicious diet mexican coke. The only downside to this place is the price- $35 for 2 burgers, 1 order of fries and 2 soft drinks. The "fast casual" concept is also a little confusing. ****4 Stars.

We visited the tasting room and loved it! The tasting room is a lot less busier than the restaurant so definitely take this route if you're just going for drinks like we did (there is no line/wait). My favorite was the Refuge IPA (their most popular beer). The only downside was the cost to fill up our growler... $25 for 60 some odd ounces seems high, even for craft beer. Looking forward to trying the food next time. ****4 Stars.

This place is a fantastic addition to downtown Chandler- they have a super cool rooftop patio, live music and great service! The Green Chile Pork Pie was DELICIOUS! I also enjoyed the apricot beer (although it was only available in a can).   PROS: atmosphere, food, service (you won't find many places like this in Chandler)  CONS: limited selection of draft beers, tater tots were not made in house (they were the kind you buy at the grocery store)   Based on previous reviews, I would say the Perch is getting better. Once they bring in a bigger selection of drafts and start making their own tater tots, I'll change this to 5 stars!

Came back last Friday and was super bummed out. We walked in and grabbed an empty table right next to the bar. Sat there and played board games for about 30 minutes... anxiously waiting for help. 2 servers/bartenders walked right by us (one did three times) carrying other people's drinks. They werent overly busy so Im not sure what changed from our last visit. Finished our game and left... thanks for the free rounds of Operation!

A solid sushi joint in N Scottsdale. Their prices are very reasonable  (even outside of HH) and the sushi is spot on. Don't forget to check in on yelp for a free steamed bowl of edamame. The patio is also very calming on a nice night. Enjoy! ****4 Stars.
