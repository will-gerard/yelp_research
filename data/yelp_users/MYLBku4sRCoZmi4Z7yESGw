I wanted to like this place because everyone else did. The decor and feel of the place is top shelf for a coffee joint. Couches, loungers, hidden nooks and corners, books galore. But that's where the cool factor stops.  We were the only ones there on a late Saturday morning with one male employee and 3 female employees.  The male (I'll refer to him as "boss" because that's what he called all the males coming in the shop) was beyond rude socially; no tact at all.  With the several LOUD and obnoxious conversations we heard him having with the girls, we overheard the F bomb being dropped several times with a few belches thrown in the middle. The most talked about topic amongst the four of them had to do with monkey penises. And at one point he went ballistic and started cursing about some political topic. I seriously think they forgot we were there. When I came out from behind the corner to get a business card to email the owner, they moved from behind the counter to behind the door in the kitchen. Of course when I went to the bathroom I could hear them in the kitchen...still talking about monkey penises. There was also some serious PDA happening with "boss" and one of the girls behind the counter. The lack of professionalism in this place knocked what could've been a 4 down to a 1. Fire "boss" and I'll think about bringing my business back.  Oh. And my large skinny iced latte had to go back for more flavor and still wasn't anything to brag about.

Happened upon Four Peaks when we drove up to the restaurant we wanted to go to and there wasn't a car in the parking lot! My hubs and I thought it was just the temps in Scottsdale, and everyone headed out of town for the weekend. However, when we walked into Four Peaks, it blew our assumption out of the water. The place was packed and the only seat left was in the bar, which was OK since we were only there for appetizers and beer.   We ended up ordering 1 entree as an appetizer, the fish and chips. The were quite good! Nicely cooked, not overly greasy and very crunchy.  Hubs got a dark and I got a light. We were very pleased with the beer and will be looking for a 6-pack in the stores.  I'm looking forward to heading back to Scottsdale to hang out here a bit longer and try some of their great looking menu!

Just a warning, if you want to be seated quickly and get great customer service, do NOT come on a Saturday morning during the opening of Spring Training. We waited for 45 minutes (by choice obviously) then were seated in a couch area that was very difficult to eat at because the couches were so low and deep, FINALLY got a waiter to come and then waited for what seemed like days for our food.  Having said all of that, our food must have been damn good to still reap a 4 star rating, and that it was! Our table of 5 enjoyed everything that was ordered and I was especially fond of the veggie hash I ordered. It was more like sauteed vegetables since they were so chunky, but heavenly nonetheless. By the looks of the plates around us, the pancakes are pretty popular here, but I'm not a pancake kind of girl. I prefer savory over sweet and they have a pretty eclectic menu to serve both tastes.  As for the vibe in the place it was great! Any place that has hippy memorabilia in a more modern space is my kind of hangout. Two thumbs up to the Jerry Garcia artwork in the back!!  Remember this place was seriously busy so it was very loud but I would come back in a heartbeat if it wasn't too too busy. I would highly recommend coming on a down day to grab a cup of joe and sit on their beautiful patio enjoying the warm Phoenix sun!

One of the most memorable breweries I've been to, not because of their personal beer choices but because of how they run the place. They have over 30 beers on tap from all over the country. If that's not cool enough, the entire back wall of the place is refrigerated coolers full of bottles and cans of even more craft brews that you can hand pick to drink in house...OR....build your own 6 pack to carry out. Brews from all over from Epic, to Dogfish, to Maui Brewing, to Sierra Nevada and the list goes on...and on....and on. It really is a nice concept!! Oh....and their food is great too. Mostly your normal bar food but pretty tasty.  As for the service? I was incredibly impressed at how the girls that were serving us really truly seemed to have some serious beer knowledge. They were able to help us pick the right beer for our liking and they were right there when the brews disappeared regardless of the fact the place was packed.  Know before you go: Don't let the exterior fool you! It's a small portion of a strip mall...look hard or you may miss it

Beautifully executed meal especially given the size of our table!  The wait staff was on queue every time.  Our drinks were never empty, water was always filled and the wine was always being poured.  Excellent service!  As for the food, I'm not a huge meat eater so I decided to forego the whole reason behind this restaurant and opt for 1lb. of King Crab legs and then munch on a few bites of steak from other plates in our party.  My legs were quite substantial, however they got cold fast since they come split in 1/2.  Not a bit deal, but when you're paying $45 for a plate of food you'd like it to be warm.  I also had the chance to taste the New York Strip and Ribeye, both cooked to perfection, nice and tender.  Our table decided to order several sides to share including the asparagus, mac and cheese and something else that escapes my memory (too many bottles of wine).  All the sides were absolutely amazing and the asparagus was cooked perfectly.  Great experience eating at Gallaghers and I would certainly recommend it to anyone.  Know before you go:  the bathrooms are a mile away so don't drink too much!!

Probably one of the most fun hikes I've done! I love the "extreme" climbing aspects of a difficult hike and this hike does not disappoint! We started from the Echo Canyon trail head and headed up...unfortunately we started too late in the day, so we weren't able to make it to the tip top due to daylight quickly approaching. We were about 10 minutes from the top before we turned around...I knew it would take longer for me to get down than it did to go up, so I didn't want to risk it. Perhaps it was the helicopter flying over head checking on hikers that made me a bit nervous, nonetheless, I wasn't nearly disappointed in the workout I got. My entire body was sore the next day, even my shoulders from having to lower myself down some pretty gnarly rocks.  It will certainly challenge you, and there are a lot of people along the way which for us was a good thing because there were times when I could have lost my way due to poor trail markings. Sometimes its so incredibly crowded that you have to move to the side to wait your turn to move on, but that didn't seem to impair my trip any. The one thing that blew my mind were the multiple trail runners we saw along the way. I can barely run a normal trail let alone one as difficult and treacherous as parts of Camelback are. Pretty amazing!!!  This hike is not for the faint of heart but will certainly get you in great shape!!!  Know before you go: Parking is VERY limited and SUCKS. With that...good luck. Also, if you forget water, they have a good fountain at the trail head to fill up...outhouses as well.

Love love love love love!!! $23.00 for 3 drinks and 2 of their awesome "bowls" at the bar! We ordered the FEZ fondue and the Gyro bowl. I was overwhelmed by all of the flavors of the Gyro bowl. That is probably one of the best things I've eaten in 2011! The drink of the evening was the G-Spot...some fruity red grapefruit concoction that was just spectacular. It was only $3 so we went for it. It was so so good!  The restaurant itself is ultra-modern, in what seemed to be a somewhat odd location but I don't know Phoenix that well, so I can't confirm that.   The service was spectacular and people watching was equally impressive. Great great restaurant. I highly recommend it!!!

By far THE BEST PLACE to eat in Phoenix!  The food paired with the atmosphere is completely SPOT ON when it comes to southwestern comfort food!  I've had the opportunity to come to Dick's only on a couple of occasions since I live out of state but it has now become my must-go-to-spot when I fly into town, even going so far as to adjust my flight schedule to accommodate my craving.  All I will say is SMOKED PORK!  OMG...it's like sensory overload when it comes the pork paired with the hollandaise sauce on the benedict and then you add the beans and potatoes, it's quite possibly the best breakfast on the planet!  Know before you go:  It's called "Hideaway" for a reason...it's virtually impossible to find.  Look for the hardware store and the door will be to the left.  There is no sign.  It's always crowded so be ready to sit at a community table if there is no room in the bar.  It may seem awkward but you can meet some interesting folks AND you have a great view of the fireplace with just a slight sent of mesquite.  Their Bloody Mary's are BOMB-diggity served with a shot of beer which I like to pour in.  Great hangover remedy!  They open early at 7am to accommodate my early arrival flights!  Booya!  Kids are not recommended and they're not afraid to tell you.

Very lovely boutique hotel! I really enjoyed staying here and would not hesitate to do it again in the future. The staff was friendly (especially the lovely lady who blessed us with free guacamole from the restaurant during the FREE snack time after 10pm which includes everything chocolate, chips, sodas and more), our room, which was considered a Jr. Suite, was incredibly roomy and decorated in a very modern 70's decor just like the rest of the place. Bright colors, very specific detailing, including bathroom products from Philosophy and Aveda, great choices of flavorful coffee pods for the Keurig coffee maker with flavored creamer, lamps from Ikea and incredible Arizona location photography on the walls. I was also intrigued by the use of blue glass throughout, including the asphalt in the parking area!!!...I'm a sucker for detail!  Another plus of the Clarendon is their beautifully thought out pool redo from a very obvious apartment complex pool throw back! They were able to implement an incredible  wall of water and split what was a boring oblong pool into one amazing jacuzzi area. And when you're tired of that you can hike up 5 flights of stairs to their rooftop seating/bar area for an amazing view of the city lights.  I really did enjoy this place. Only downside is the thin walls and old school windows which let in a lot of noise and cold air (it's cold in Phoenix in the winter). Other than that, I can't wait to come back.

SERIOUS MEXICAN NOM'S!!!  My husband and I stopped here after flying into Phoenix.  It was a bit late but they were more than willing to accommodate us, thank goodness!!!  I was craving good, real homemade Mexican food after being in the Midwest for months with no real Mexican.  This place seriously hit the spot.  Dive restaurant in not so good part of town...so what!! Trust me, you don't want to pass this place up.  The service is fast and friendly and the margaritas are seriously yummy BUT the MOLE is TO-DIE-FOR!!!  Seriously, I ate so much I'm pretty sure I almost died but the flavor of that mole was so incredibly rich and delectable that I could NOT stop eating.  It was by far the BEST MOLE I've ever had!  The other impressive part of their mole was that the chicken was served on the bone, almost stew style, which you don't see much.  Normally you order mole and it's either shredded or chunk white meat.  The bone-in chicken added to the richness of this dish.  I highly, highly recommend it!!!  Don't miss this place. You'll regret it! I shall return Barquita.  Te amo!!

On a trip to Scottsdale we just HAD TO pull over after seeing "the land of wine"! Who wouldn't stop!!!?  Now...I'm not sure about the special listed, the Tuesday through Friday $8 glass, because that's not what I paid! Most of the glasses were over $12! I'm a bit disappointed to find the special post-visit and knowing the prices weren't offered to us.  Given the disappointment I still give it a 4 stars. The employee was awesome and I loved the ambiance of the place. Lots of couch/living room type seating and lots of wine magazines to educate yourself.  The funnest part of the evening was trying to find the hidden bathroom!! Not really, but surprisingly a metal sliding door that you tend to walk right past.  Make sure you stop by. Keep the place open for goodness sake; they need your business! It's pretty cool!

I am incredibly impressed with this place and I will go out of my way to go to Phoenix when the rock climbing bug hits!  I've been climbing a couple of times, but only belaying my kids. This time I jumped in as a climber for a few reasons: 1. my awesome GTS workouts prepared me strength wise. 2. They have several auto-belays, so both my kids and I could climb individually. 3. For an indoor climbing gym, it's CHEAP!!!  We hardly ever go to Rocks and Ropes in Tucson because it's so pricey. Not only do you have to pay the entry fee, but the equipment rental is separate. So for a family of 4, you're breaking the bank. Not that way at AZ on the Rocks. They have a special for a family of 4. $45 plus tax. That's it! No equipment rental fees AND it's all day! What a deal!!  We ended up spending about 4 or 5 hours there and had an absolute blast.  Their registration and safety intro procedures are simple, well done and easy to understand. The staff is really on the ball when it comes to scanning the gym and the climbers to make sure everyone is doing it right. There are a multitude of climbing levels and walls, as well as a large bouldering area.  On the second level they have an entire gym with treadmills, elliptical machines and free weights that you're more than welcome to use. Along with all that, they offer yoga classes and more.  I cannot wait to get back to AZ on the Rocks! Thank you for making my first climbing experience an A+. I'm officially addicted!

Five star breakfast all the way!! Gallo Blanco is the restaurant housed inside of the Clarendon Hotel (boutique style).   We met some friends here for breakfast after reading the reviews on Yelp as well as delving into some seriously delicious guacamole the night before. Most of us took our waitresses recommendation on the Chilaquillas and I, personally, was SO glad I did. I think I literally licked my plate clean. Now mind you, it was not your typical soggy, enchilada sauce soaked, casserole of tortilla chips. This was an out-of-the world, new age way of making Chilaquillas. I'm not going to give it away, I will just say you'll never look at the traditional dish the same way again.  The restaurant is quite 70's modern as is the entire them of the Clarendon and the servers and staff of the restaurant are top shelf. Always there when you need them and not there when you don't. Perfect service. If I were in Phoenix again and needed to find a place for breakfast I would certainly go out of my way to get to Gallo Blanco again.  On a side note, we did not get the chance to go in the evening, but they do serve dinner, they do have a full bar and the one night we saw it, the place was packed so I'm sure it's just as good in the evening as it is in the morning.

I hate to be a downer but this is potentially one of the most overrated places in Vegas.  It's packed so you have to wait a while which is fine. And I know tapas, but this tapas isn't anything to brag about.  Smaller than small plate portions for outrageous prices and slow - slow - slow service.  Our server would bring out 1 plate and bring another plate 15 to 20 minutes later; mind you, all plates were ordered at the same time.  it would have been nice taking more than 2 bites every quarter hour.  And honestly the food was not as flavorful as I would have liked; very under-seasoned.  Convenient factor is the only thing going for this place.  Honestly I wouldn't bother.

By far one of the most impressively beautiful and tasty buffets I've ever been to!  Mind you I'm not a buffet fan so this wasn't my choice but I'm glad I came.  I do have to say I was thrown back by my $42 "entry fee" but since I was in Vegas on business it wasn't coming out of my pocket or I probably would have choked.  Having said that, I would say it was worth every penny!  The options here are limitless!  My recommendations:  Sushi Bar Build-Your-Own Seafood stew/soup bar  Build-Your-Own Mac and Cheese!!  Holy heaven! Risotto Crab legs & WAY MORE!  The most eye catching thing by far at this place is the several desert bars which are more of a piece of art than a piece for the palate.  So many different beautifully layed out options that it's virtually impossible to choose from...a feast for the sugar addict for sure!  Make sure you're famished before you go...you could eat for a few hours at this place!  I recommend little portions so you can eat everything on your way through! YUM!

After a long day at work and just wanting a quick meal so I could hurry off to my room and go to bed, (yes I was in Vegas, no I wasn't gambling) my friend and I decided on Five50 and SO happy we did!  What a pleasant surprise for my taste buds!  My friend ordered the meatball sandwich and I ordered the eggplant sandwich and we both shared a salad since the sandwiches didn't come with sides and we thought we would need more food.  WRONG!  Our meals would have been plenty!  Both sandwiches were stupendous.  Full of flavor and textures and cooked to perfection...and OH those meatballs!!  The salad was a nice addition but overall it was far too much food for us to finish.  We were so stuffed that we weren't able to partake in what looked like some fabulous classic milk shakes!  Overall I was VERY pleased and next time I stay at Aria will come back for the wood-fired pizza!!  GOOD STUFF!  OH....and our server was excellent!  Very attentive and a great personality to boot!

Nothing but a 5 star resort experience at very affordable prices. I'm shocked reading some of the previous reviews because I have absolutely no complaints, aside from thin walls that allow evening noise in. That's what earplugs are for people.  This hotel re-opened in November of 2011 owned by the Joie de Vivre hotel chain and is an absolutely beautiful boutique style hotel. We were so impressed with it that we decided to cancel our previous Saturday plans and hang out poolside all day. Great choice!! The larger of the pool areas is a resort-like experience with both food and drink servers that come to you on your queen size lounging beds or in your covered cabana while you watch the flat screen TV and enjoy the fireplace (it's still "winter"). The staff and servers and very attentive and always around when you need something. And if that's not cool enough, their poolside food comes from one of their two in-house restaurants Distrito, which is a highly-rated tapas style restaurant run by Chef Jose Garces!! Put it this way...the food is spectacular and their drink menu is just as impressive.  As for the aesthetics of the hotel, if you're not into a 70's hipster style atmosphere with bright colors and bold artwork then this place is not for you. But I find this type of architecture and art to be quite mood altering. The lobby of the hotel is absolutely beautiful and leads to the entrance to Distrito and their other restaurant on-site Old Town Whiskey, which is also highly rated. The rooms are just as modern and colorful with an amazingly comfortable bed!! Like I said previously, bring earplugs. It is an older hotel so the walls are a bit thin.  The grounds of the hotel are quite spread out so figure out the numbering system or you may get lost. However if you do get lost you may end up in the yoga circle next to their hammock garden...not too bad!  If you,re not into hanging out at the hotel all day then you won't have a lack of things to do. The hotel is located right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, so walk a block in any direction and you'll be somewhere cool! Lots of restaurants and shopping opportunities! And if you're there on a Saturday make sure to check out Old Town's farmers market. Probably the largest and best one I've ever experienced. And more than likely there will be some type of festival going on in the park adjacent to the Scottsdale Civic Center which is just behind the hotel. LOTS to do in a beautiful location.  I think I'm in love!  Know before you go: The hotel parking is not run by the hotel but an outside company and they charge $14 a day. If you're not wanting to pay, there is a parking garage in between the hotel and Old Town and it's free.
