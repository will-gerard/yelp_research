My rep takes the time to discuss projects I have and offers her insight to help me meet project goals within budget and deadline, something my previous printer did not do very well with me. I trust the quality I am getting and feel like she is a partner in my business.

Definitely hate visiting an Endodontic office and the words "You need a root canal" are some of the scariest words one can be told, but this is the place to go should one need the service. Caring and compassionate Dr. Allen and Dr. Wolcott. I have seen them both and the consistent care they provide as well as the friendliness of staff and high tech equipment has me feeling confident about the work I got. I recommend to all my family and friends for sure.

Playground is great. train and carousel are old but fun for the kids. Not a huge fan of the splash pad, mosquitos and ants unless you are in the water like to take a little bite out of you. Could use an update to the pad.

We are so glad we found Cactus Preschool. My kids love their teachers and are thriving in the environment. Everyone is caring and kind but also structured and fair. The director involves parents and brings fun after hours activities at the holiday time which helps us get to know our teachers better. Great school and highly recommend.

This was pretty fun place. We took our 2.5 and 4 yr old. We had to do everything with them and some of the stuff was a bit small to fit through for us, but overall it was a very fun experience. Bungee jump only $5 and the staff here are pretty friendly (mostly high schoolers) food offerings could be healthier and lighting could be a little better in the climbing structures. We will go back prob in another year I think it's prob better for 5 and up.

Love this splash pad, fun water features, and I usually meet some very nice moms here. Swings are close to pad and playground is covered. Bathrooms could always use a little TLC but it's a park so I can forgive that a little.

Came with a friend and it was packed! Great food and cocktails. The pear mule takes the cake and the salads were filling! Definitely going back again!
