Terrible service and rude. The place says open until 4pm but tried calling from 3:20 to 4:00 pm to ask a question and there was no answer, I guess they don't answer the phones? I recommend going to ASAP title service in Tempe, they are much friendlier and willing to help.

Place is old and dingy with a unique historical feel but I'm not there for the atmosphere. Overall, one of the best burgers you can get in Tempe.

My friends and I have been eating here consistently for the past month and it has been nothing less than exceptional. The service is fantastic and are even greeted by the owners and staff before being seated, it fees like home. I've tried the shawarma which is the best that I've had in the valley. I've ordered it over a dozen times and it's always consistent, top: (mix the red rooster hot sauce with the garlic sauce). The mandi with chicken is on point! Rice is smokey and flavorful, while the chicken is succulent and juicy. Fruit smoothies are sweet and have REAL fruit which makes them a nice treat for Arizona summers. If you really want a delicious dessert try the Kanafah with cheese, you won't be disappointed. Shredded crispy noodles with a gooey cheese filling topped with a rose water syrup and topped with toasted pistachios. Yes, the place is huge with lots of empty space but that's the nice part about it, the freedom to sit anywhere you want with privacy. If you like traditional Arabic music I recommend checking out the hookah lounge within the restaurant. If it's too noisy check out the patio with a laid back atmosphere and misters! A hidden gem that feels like home with great food, hookahs and music. Highly recommended!
