Boy do I love Pho! But not just Pho, goooood Pho! Khai Hoan is the best Pho in the valley, hands down. It is better than all of the Pho I have found in LA as well. There broth is extremely flavorful. The meat is great quality, and the rare beef is always brought out freshly placed in the bowl so that it doesn't get over-cooked.  The rice dishes are also very good.   Sonny, the owner, is an amazing guy, and the restaurant is a truly family owned and operated business.  Also, I recommend checking out their 'sister' restaurant, Cyclo in Chandler. It is a very kitchy space with modern furnishings and bright, bold colors.

The service was great. He was very attentive and always nearby when needed. I am hoping that the kitchen was just having an off night. We ordered the bruschetta appetizer and the toppings were great, but the bread was burnt. We ordered two different pizzas, one red, and one white. The red was the vegetariano. It was quite salty and the crust was very burnt on one half of the pie. The white pizza's name escapes me, but it is the one with a truffle oil drizzle. This pizza was extremely salty! The crust was in better shape, but still on the well done side.  I like the location, the atmosphere is great, and the service was also good. Because of the salty pizza and consistently burnt bread, I'm not sure that I will return. Again, I hope it was just a kitchen error, but I dont think I will take that chance.

Yume Sushi Grill is a great spot! All of the sushi is very fresh, and they pride themselves in having great quality. The sushi chefs are knowledgeable in their craft, and also extremely friendly to have a chat with. They serve free salad and miso soup, and the serving staff is friendly, helpful, and attentive.  The Korean dishes are pretty authentic, and the home made kimchi is great! I recommend the bulgogi, bi bim bab, and spicy pork for meals. Lunch time is the best time to go, as their lunch specials are amazingly priced for the amount of food that you receive.   The one complaint that I have is that they don't stock a few of my favorite kinds of sushi (although I know they aren't the most popular) mackerel, quail eggs, and surf clam won't be found on the menu.

Amazing food, great service. Solo trattoria uses locally grown produce when possible. The chef is brilliant! Amazing traditionally inspired Italian dishes that fits the local Phoenix culture. The best pizza crust I have ever tasted! Try the Panna Cotta dessert... Absolutely to die for! Also the house made pasta really can't be any better.
