We tried the Japanese food there. The service is incredibly fast and everything is served on Styrofoam or plastic. The fish tasted fresh but the flavors didn't really come together. The pieces are also small and the rice isn't sushi rice.. which didn't help with the taste.  For the price, it's fair, but I've had better for that price. I might come back and try the Chinese food.

The broth is on point here and it's one of the better ramen places in the Valley. I also love the takoyaki. The service is sometimes slow, especially if they're busy.
