GREAT ACTS and GREAT PEOPLE; It's not called the SPOT for nothing! The atmosphere is awesome with a real intimate setting. The show room seats about 100 people so there is no bad seat in the house. The bar area was remodeled and sports a very elegant look and feel and if Customer Service is important to you, well then this is the place for you because the SPOT has some of the BEST servers in the valley.   At the Spot you will get great national acts, local talent, and even some pretty special appearances all for under $15.

In need of a place to take a large group of people? Want to take your kids but need to save money? Then Buca is for you! With 4 kids and a tight wallet my wife and I look for place where kids eat free or the food is cheap and plentiful. While Buca doesn't offer kids free food they do offer GREAT food at a reasonable price with portions large enough to SHARE and SPARE.   The dinning experience is great! The restaurant is split into semiprivate rooms with only a few tables in each space. There is a real family feel here! Although, the photo's and art that decorates the walls have sparked some interesting conversations with my 7 year old the decor is really fun!   I certainly recommend this restaurant!

SERVICE IS A MUST!   Immediately, my expectations were high thanks to Man v. Perhaps too high. After arriving with a party of 7, me and the crew realized that we should have sat separately as it took nearly 15 minutes for someone to happen by and take our drink order. One of the members of our group was unsure of his order so we asked the server to take the rest of them and put them in. She took the orders and never placed them instead she waited another 15 minutes and finally took my friends order and placed it with ours. After the third trip to the table it was impossible to find he again. We confronted the manager and he said he would take care of it. Which apparently meant she was going to complain to us about our issues with her services. She finally came back to the table and said "So, you told my manager your not happy with my services?" awkward...and yes that is what she said. No apology, no attempt to make it better, no refills and the service got worse. Service is a BIG part of going out for me. The food can be terrible but if the service is great I just may go back. If you have the BEST food in the world and the service is lousy I will not go back. As for this place I will NOT be going back!   As for the food... well, it was okay but it was hard to get past the server. Give it a shot and hopefully, your experience with the staff is more pleasant.

Took the kids here to play and honestly, I could have had as much fun at the local park with a Frisbee and some BBQ. The equipment seemed old and out dated and the driving range was falling apart. My father and I attempted to hit a couple of buckets and 6 machines were down forcing us to wait nearly half an hour to hit. The staff at the range needed to be better informed as to the availability of hitting stalls so that we would have been better served. Also, the putt putt course or Mini Golf for the enthusiast, is tattered and needs some attention. There were a lot of young kids (Teenagers) playing on the course acting recklessly and disrespectfully which was terrible for my FAMILY outing. There needs to be staff constantly roving the facility for trash and behavior issues.   The only redeeming quality was the arcade and even that was a bit dated and expensive for the age and quality of the games. Oh, wait... the Churro's were really good that day so if you do happen to stop by for some reason be sure to try out the Churro's.

The atmosphere at T&T is awesome. The servers are amazing, friendly, and eager to please! There is a full service bar and the tenders are talented and generous! With FREE chips and some of the best salsa on the strip you are just getting started. Quickly you will notice that for a Vegas Strip restaurant the prices are great! Between $10-$30 for appetizers to main dishes and they offer select combos so you can have an orgy of flavor on your pallet. The cooks are phenomenal whipping your meal up in a timely manner. Either way it wouldn't matter because the food presentation is like art. So well done you will want to snap a picture and frame it when you get home!   You will love this place from the second you arrive. Especially if the mariachi band is there playing the hottest hits from the '80's.   CHEERS!

This seems to be a gym for the men with its rough edges and boxing ring center piece. The equipment is a bit dated and it lacks any modern feel but honestly, it is amazing for the price. My wife and I enjoy going to this gym and it is certainly in our budget. For just $99 you get your annual membership and can take kickboxing and other classes at no additional charge! It doesn't get much better than that.   The staff Tom, John, Deidre and the others are fantastic and always helpful.

Completely disappointed!!! They lied to my wife and I about pricing and service abilities.  Took my wifes phone in for a data transfer, her screen was broken and it was impossible for us to sync the phone. Nick said that it wouldn't be a problem "We do this a lot." I was told that the service would cost $40...not bad...worth the price if it will work. I explained to Nick that Sprint had already made an attempt to transfer the data and were unsuccessful. He insisted that he could get it done and that it would take about an hour given the work load they had for the day. My wife and returned an hour and a half later and no work was completed and then the excuses came pouring in. My wife and I preceeded to wait for another hour and 20 minutes as he attempted to do something that other had not be able to do, which I informed him of. It truely felt like a competition, as though he was determined to make Sprint and the other tech that attempted to fix look stupid. It was matter of pride and void of any customer concern.   Once Nick finally gave up in frustration, he told us to take the screen he was using to access the phone home with us so that we could write the information by hand since he could not transfer it. He was very clear that he would not charge us for the screen usage. We expressed our gratitude for the assistance even though we were beyond frustrated by this point.   My wife returned the screen today and NICK charged her $43 dollars not $40 for the data transfer. My wife informed Nick that he did not transfer the data as promised and she would not pay for that so Nick charged her $43 dollars for useage of the screen which he stated on multiple occassions was FREE.   I don't like being lied to! if they would have kept their word I would have tipped them and gave them repeat busy. INSTEAD, they get negative reviews and bad word of mouth. I will NEVER recommend people here, unless that recommendation is to go somewhere else.

Okay,  my friends and I took a shot and tried this place and honestly the food was great and the menu looked awesome!  I'm definitely a fan of the food...the reason for the 4star rating is because of the service.  A couple in our group ordered a Shrip Protein bowl (delicious) and after everyone at the table had nearly finished eating at the table our friends received the wrong order.  My friend provided the staff with his receipt to correct the issue and 15 minutes later my friends received the wrong meal again.  When we discussed the matter with the manager there was no ownership of the issue, he only said that the ticket was lost. My friend was told that they would be happy to refund his money but he wouldn't get his food if he did that.  Over 8 Shrimp bowls went out in the hour my friends patiently waited.  Service can make or break an experience and my friends will not be coming back. I will be back for sure but It will most likely be solo!  Customer service is key!  Except responsibility and make concessions when you make a mistake.
