I have never left a bad review, and actually been coming here for years off and on. Today experience has been the worse, the service was extremely slow been her for 2 hours and still waiting for my car. An oil change and basic car wash, we had to keep asking how much longer would the oil change take, which took over an hour. At least could have given us a free wash after this. Not sure if owners have changed, but never will do an oil change here again.

Dr. Veena and her assistant were so compassionate and sweet. I can not express enough nice things about the the two of them. This is the hardest thing to have to do, I could not have asked for two better ladies to be with us. I wish I had known about this before, I would recommend to anyone. After they took our girls paw print and made a keepsake for us. Thank you again ladies
