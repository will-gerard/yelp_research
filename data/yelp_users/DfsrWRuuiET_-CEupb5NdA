The place is dirty, parking is rough. I just dont understand all the reviews...they are very misleading. Who wants to pay $10 for a Gyro in a dive like this. Even the glasses are plastic. I would not take a date there. i would not take a co-worker there. I would not go there for a business lunch. If I had just come off the basketball court with 3 other sweaty friends i might go there. Yuck...dont waste your time.

This is the kind of place that gives ethnic food lovers dream about. The market itself specializes in all kinds of ethnic, mainly Middle Eastern and Arabic, fare, Fresh and varied....the bread is freshly baked, soft and fragrant. People buy it by the cart load. The meat market sells everything from testicles to tongues...dont go near the butcher if you are squeamish! The Al Hana restaurant makes most things fresh to order it but they also keep a ready supply of things like meat pies in the cooler to serve you faster. Eat in or take out. The Babaganoush, Tabouli and Humus are about the best you can get. Take home plenty of Pita bread to scoop it up with. Hookah pipes and supplies line the walls near the exit.

Fresh, well prepared and inventive food served in a bright, urban environment. Excellent service by well informed waitress. I chose the delicious shrimp and artichoke lemon risotto and my date had the Yellow fin Tuna salad which was sublime. We started with a fresh Asparagus soup that we shared and an absolutely fantastic chocolate bread pudding with caramel sauce. Very reasonably priced for the type of food served. Wholeheartedly recommend this gem.

We went for lunch and had a duck confit sandwich on a fresh baguette ($12) and a Noca chop sandwich ($10). Both Top quality with the salad being probably the best I've ever tasted in Phoenix. Lunch prices are much more reasonable than dinner but its a tad more casual...smaller menu, you order at the counter, water in plastic glasses. But this is definitely worth trying. For a dollar or two more than chain restaurants or 'brands' you can have an expertly cooked and presented food sensation! BTW they are closed for dinner throughout July.

Wow. We went on Tuesday, late afternoon, and the place was still rocking. They take Taco Tuesday to a whole new level. Great wait staff, food takes a while to come out, but it is delicious and CHEAP! Wonderful combinations, all the Tacos were stunning. Some a little spicy....but I like that! Apparently they have live Flamenco dancers on Wednesdays but you better get there early if you want a table! Nice outdoor patio area too

This was not a pleasant experience. The hotel was over run with 900 hospitality event attendees filling every nook and cranny with loud conventioneers. The restaurant was noisy so we asked the hostess to seat us in a quieter spot. She took us to a table right in the middle....probably the loudest spot in there. We then asked our waitress to move us which she did. The food is expensive but that is to be expected for the Biltmore.  But it is over priced for the quality and the small portions. My crab cake BLT was $18 and was cold and greasy. The fries were the saving grace, being crisp and delicious. T. Cooks at Royal Palm or  Elements at The Sanctuary are far better hotel restaurant alternatives. I would not go back.

Pita Jungle downtown Phoenix. What a cool place....exposed ceiling and brickwork, attentive young wait staff. This eatery would not be out of place downtown anywhere. Baba Ganoush to die for...roasted for ages for deep smokey flavor. Hummus good, grilled chicken breast a little dry but tasty. Also has salads, wood-fired pizzas and more. Corner of 3rd St and Roosevelt in downtown Phoenix. Bar area looks like a nice place to hang out too. I havent been to any other Pita Jungle so this is reviewed without comparing it to the others.

Cant believe all the rave reviews on here! If you like to eat dry, chewy tasteless meat in your tacos....this place is for you. If you like to eat with plastic utensils in a dirty restaurant and pay $3 for a coke....this is for you. If you like grimy walls, dirty floors and a salsa bar with half the choices empty....go for it. The meat in the street tacos were overcooked, chewy and tasteless. The taco meal for $9 came with 2 small tacos, and a thimble full of beans and a similar amount of rice. On a piece of paper in a plastic tray. You have to get your own plastic utensils and napkins...which I dont mind, just not at these prices. The famous salsa bar was half empty and I had to ask for forks as they had run out. Poor, very poor. Dont waste your money.

What a wonderful restaurant. I can't believe each dish is 475 calories or less and the portions are still a good size. No sauces, no bread, no fries. The fish tacos were delicious, succulent, with just the right amount of spiciness. The grilled, boneless rainbow trout was fantastic. The pane seared, sushi-grade Ahi Tuna salad was to die for. And leave room for dessert....yes dessert. Only $2.50 but arrives in a shot glass size bowl. just enough to stave off the sugar craving. The decor is elegant and sophisticated. Great for an executive power lunch or a date to impress. menu changes 4 times a year and features local, fresh, in 'season' food. Very inventive menu starting mainly around $9 (flatbreads and sandwiches) to $16 for lunch. Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive. Great food, great atmosphere, great for your waist line. But even if you're not a calorie counter this still ranks right up there for the food quality, taste and presentation.

Gorgeous restaurant that has been well-designed down to the smallest detail. My date told me the ladies even had a hook for their purse and a lighted make-up mirror. That is great attention to detail that overflows into the decor, food and service. I love to see a small menu featuring fresh local food. Although the Osso Buco was only average the accompanying spaetzle was superb, slightly crunchy and flavorful. The Syrah from Cote Du Rhone area of France was a worthy accompaniment. The steamed white Bass was light, delicate yet sensational. Served over a bed of fresh, seasonal organic vegetables, the effect was delightful. Approx $18 each. Then the dessert. The award winning fig and Pecan Pie was creatively paired with a citrus ice cream. And the choc covered bacon and s'mores, with home made marshmallows, caramel, graham crackers and whipped peanut butter (like ice cream) was to die for. Only $6 each. Definitely worth going. Great for dates, special occasions, group of friends. Smart casual. PS. See how many pigs you can see hidden around the place :)

Still my favorite Thai restaurant in the valley. Every dish is perfectly cooked, meticulously presented and mouthwateringly good. Not your average dishes so be adventurous. The wait staff will gladly explain any and all dishes. Not too spicy, unless you want it to be, but packed full of flavor. The portions are not huge...they favor quality over quantity...but its not expensive either.  Great location, cold modern interior, this is a 'must try' gastronomic delight.

Garry Smith, the owner of Urban Living furniture store (at the Biltmore), is a liar and a cheat. If you buy anything here make sure you walk out with it in your hands. Do NOT order anything. He will take your money and not deliver. Do NOT give this man cash or a check. Better still, dont shop there at all. He is a con man.

Highly recommended! Rice Paper is not your hole-in-the-wall type Vietnamese restaurant. Its urban, chic, clean, modern...great for a date, business lunch, or fun with friends. They specialize in hand rolls, not the deep fried kind, but wonderful fresh, light and tasty rice paper concoctions. We tried 3...a seared Ahi Tuna, a Shrimp and asparagus and a tempura soft-shell crab. All delicious. The vodka based Mandarin Ginger Fizz was a worthy cocktail accompaniment. Finished off with a large Ginger Creme Brûlée which was sublime. Happy Hour is from 11 to 6:30 and its very busy at lunch. Fast, friendly service starts when one of the lovely owners greet you on arrival. Most tables are for two but there is a large communal table in the middle for a larger crowd. Nice bar area too.

Cant believe how busy it was on a Wed morning! About a 15 minute wait at 9:40 am. Very nice though, prompt service, freshly squeezed fresh OJ, lots of choice. Food was fresh delicious and served quickly. Approx $9 for each item (omelette, burrito, pancakes, eggs benedict). NE corner of Hayden and Via de Ventura. Nice patio with umbrellas and misters.

I used to love the kebabs and gyro's but I was very disappointed this weekend. The chicken kebab skewers were small, over cooked and dried out. The gyro was half the size it used to be.  After eating some of it I called ZK Grill to complain. They gave no apology and wanted me to bring it all back uneaten to get a refund! Shameful. When I first started eating there it was much cheaper and they have increased their prices steadily. With the quality of the food now it is no longer worth it.

I gave it one star last year but thought it was time to try it again. Unfortunately I wish I could give it 1/2 a star. It has got more expensive..which is a mistake. It is a sparsely furnished, uninviting place with formica topped tables and a take out counter. This is NOT a restaurant. First...they had run out of Falafel! A Mediterranean restaurant without Falafel is like a burger joint without fries! Second the Gyro meat was dried out, burnt and inedible. And about 1/2 the amount they used to serve. No, no, no. Don't waste your money or your taste buds.

We had been looking forward to visiting this place for weeks. We decided the Happy Hour menu looked more interesting than the lunch. Boy were we wrong. First of all their concept of HH is wrong. Charging a dollar or 2 less than the same dinner item is not a Happy Hour. Nor is charging $2 less for an inferior wine that doesn't even appear on the regular wine list! Thats just robbery. When the waiter came over I pointed to 2 wines on the list and asked what they were...'wine' he said. i should have got up and left right then!  And the food...as disappointing as the service. We ordered the Mussels in a savory tomato sauce. Half the Mussels were 'off' and the bread was a soggy, greasy fried lump. Where is a nice chunk of fresh italian artisan bread? Next was the $11 ribs. Obviously heated up from the night before they were tasteless, dry and overcooked. The coleslaw accompaniment however was simply heavenly. The Bruschetta was not toasted but  'fried' on the griddle so the taste of the old grease permeated the bread. It was also burnt on the bottom. I tried the fried pigs ears. Sounded interesting. But again, everything was covered in a greasy film of old, stale grease. Now I know a dish of FRIED pigs ears, and FRIED kale and FRIED egg has to be fried. But a good chef should be able to lightly fry a dish like that so the flavors shine....not drown in a sea of oil. The only saving grace? After complaining to the waiter he did deduct 2 dishes from our bill. Not somewhere i am in a hurry to visit again....there are way too many better options in town.

What a great idea! Toasted sandwiches seared around the edges and filled with lovely, inventive, tasty fillings! Some may call them called Toastites or Toasties. Delightfully paired ingredients for breakfast or lunch. Quick, fresh, hot, delicious...what more could you ask for. Oh yes, breakfast around $4 -$5 and lunch around $6.50. Tasteful modern clean interior. Now open every day this will become a fast favorite. Try the Kale side salad (included in price) with chef/owner Carole's secret dressing. Wow!

I'm surprised the Postino/Upward guys have put out a sub-par restaurant. Its not like them at all. Maybe they need time. If you like eating burnt pizzas in a room with the music so loud it sounds like you're in the trunk of a low-rider then this is the place for you. It was lunch time so the music should be scaled back to suit the patrons, not the wait staff. Maybe its more appropriate at night but lunch time is usually conversation time. The menu is small...8 pizzas, 4 sandwiches and 3 desserts. Just very surprised that every pizza that was delivered to us and our surrounding tables had a black, burned crust. The sandwich was outstanding....but this is called Federal PIZZA. I'll try again in a month to see if they have improved.

These are the same people that own Gallo Blanco in the Clarendon Hotel. The food is the same superb, zesty, creative fare I've come to love but now in a more hip, urban chic, upscale environment. Perfect for a date, business meeting, or hang out with friends. Dont forget happy hour every day, including weekends, from 2-6 pm. Carne Asada tacos for $1.50 cannot be beat! A great modern twist on Mexican food, well-prepared, fresh, great taste, reasonable prices. Great salads too. On 7th St next to Healthy Habit just north of Bethany Home Rd.  I think they are opening another Gallo Blanco at the Ling & Louie's place at the Biltmore too.

Great cafe, modern, clean interior, plenty of parking. The Focaccia bread sandwiches run about $10 and you get a nice, large, freshly made sandwich with a large.delicious house salad with candied pecans, croutons and Feta cheese. The salmon Bruschetta was amazing and the Proscuitto and Gruyere ones were great...and for $3 for two they were well worth it. Also they are charity driven so its for a great cause. The menu also shows some $5 breakfast choices so we'll definitely try it in the morning too. Coffee was smooth, full bodied and delicious. Free wifi. The wine and beer menu looks thoughtfully chosen and reasonably priced. They have just opened so time to show them some love people :)

The place is modern, light and clean. The coffee is wonderful, the counter service is friendly but a tad slow....but who is in a hurry on Sunday! Excellent fresh food but the breakfast sandwich is a little on the small side (but I'm spoiled by Big Matts). I didn't go early so parking was fine. My fellow diners' cereal, breakfasts and Eggs Benedict looked delicious.

Very innovative and creative menu. Wonderful cocktails. Great service (Brian). One of the owners (Nick) chatted with us at our table, offered us his personal favorites, and then later we saw him washing windows and cleaning the kitchen....thats what a real passionate owner does! Bravo sir!  The steamed buns are definitely worth trying, in fact, try them all. The Poutine was superb. The chef used to work at The Parlor when it was at its best so you know this guy knows how to cook. Another great addition to Phoenix dining.

This is a neighborhood Thai restaurant, locally owned. As such I was eager to try the classic neighborhood Thai restaurant tradition....TAKEOUT! You can imagine my surprise when they refuse to let you take out anything off the lunch menu. What?! You have to order off the much more expensive dinner menu. So Pad Thai noodles for $7.98 on the lunch menu was not available to me. So I had to pay $11.98. That is insane. Just a warning if you're thinking about take-out.

The freshest ingredients around including the bread. The sandwich, with salad, is $9 but worth every penny. The ingredients are the highest quality and you can really taste that. This is not a deli, Subway or Wildflower....this is high quality, locally sourced ingredients. Even the EVOO was just pressed yesterday. The soup is delicious but a little on the small side. You have to buy a loaf of their scrumptious bread to devour later of course. I think the disposable plates should give way to real utensils.The menu is on a chalkboard because its constantly changing depending on what is fresh/best that day. A real gem. Parking is tight.
