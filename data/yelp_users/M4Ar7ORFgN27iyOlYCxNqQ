Mongolian beef was absolutely awful. As in $27 that should have been used at any other Chinese restaurant on the strip. The meat was chunky, not thinly sliced as advertised, and not as original recipe follows. The meat was chewy as is I cut In the middle of each piece and it was red and bloody. I didn't order a filet mignon medium rare. This is such a simple dish, ugh, how you mess it up? The sauce was a sweet and sour sauce-I could see it being poured right out of a bottle, that's how bland this tasted. This was just a wanky version of what I expected. Also he recommended this dish as the best. What? Seriously?  Then, I pointed out how red it was, and he remade it. And guess what, the second time around the meat was exactly the same. Red, bloody and chewy inside.   I feel like if I went to a 4 or 5 star restaurant the server would gladly exchange for another dish or do something but he was clueless as to why I asked for the check and my bowl was full of the original dish.   Sorry folks for the rant but I'm highly disappointed for the service and the food.   This is Vegas! You need your a game at all times-I would not recommend. Just got to Vegas and this is my first experience. Do not come here. And if you do just drink the alcohol. Don't get the food.   The service was traditional authentic Asian servers. Nice, but just didn't seem to care that I did not touch my food.

Sat at the bar, excellent service! The Chinese ladies were making fresh noodles, the steamer was right in the middle for people to see food prepared, just a fantastic view. We ordered har pow(shrimp/pork belly) and it was fresh, made to order and delicious.  We also ordered the oceans nest? It was pan fried egg noodles with seafood and very delicious. At $36 definitely overpriced, but it included one crab leg, 2 giant prawns, scallops, Chinese mushrooms, Bok Choy -portion for 2 people! Tasted absolutely fantastic.   No complaints, might come back for the Mexican side next time. But the Chinese side was fantastic!

What's the most important piece for your decision at an airport on where to eat? Time.  I give it a 4 because the line moves pretty quickly and the people were cordial.  Food quality is pretty decent. Price is a little ridiculous, but hey all airports are.  Bacon eggs toast and home style potatoes were $9. My iced coffee was another $2.   They have a lot of choices for lunch for sandwiches, and they seem to make everything fresh. Plenty of seats.

Almond milk option in an airport? I'm always fascinated by this. I think Phoenix cares about being healthy after all!  I got an iced mocha almond milk and tasted great. The two baristas were super friendly. No complaints!
