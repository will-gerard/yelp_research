Great and huge selection of DVDs. Kids and adults - you'd actually want to watch. Recent

Yes!! I have been sneaking Salvadoran nostalgia here for several years. Besides the eye-rolling pupusas, the platanos con frijoles y crema is definitely worth it.  I am a regular appetite, 40 yr old woman & if I just order 1 pupusa, I can finish the plantain dish. :)

I am pretty interested in food, & the fact that this place actually goes to the effort of making crepes is important to me. They do each fresh by hand...mostly I've had the basic egg/pesto & nutella ones. No, they are not like crepe stands in Paris, I'm sure (??? hey! We're in the desert!) but I have enjoyed them. Nice outdoor seating options & laid-back service. I like this place a lot.

This is one of the few places I can go, sit at the bar, & order a nice dinner & maybe a Blue Moon and feel "among my people." Also...I can bring my 80something parents and 50something siblings here on St Pat's Day (granted- DAY, not night) and they fully enjoy it. Finally...this is where I learned that my culture has FOOD! Yes- the Irish have a culinary heritage. Who knew. At Rula it looks like: salmon, boxty, bread pudding ice cream, shepherd's pie. Don't let the bar appetizers keep you from ordering 1 or 2 great entrees....

Just read the "restroom" issue & I had to add my SONG of praise to the restrooms here! I could have fallen asleep and this was lunch on a weekday. Candles, blue paint, calm, ahhh. And yes - the burgers are unreal, plus they sold my crazy friend one of the mini shopping cart condiment dispensers!

I am SO glad to find this! A guy from Mexico I dated took me here, and I've wanted to get back but could not remember the name. You know , if you're like me- I'm always looking & looking at little hole-in-the-wall Mexican places wondering:  gem? food poisoning? 6 :00 news "outing"? This is in the gem category. Be fearless, be confident. go eat there.

I found this guy using your reviews- & it's my privilege to add another 5 stars to his constellation! Besides doing a perfect job and explaining every excruciating dollar of repairs I needed, Gene paid a "house call" to me in a bank parking lot, at 5 pm on a Friday, in 110-degree heat, b/c my car wouldn't start. I called , desperate, asking for a tow recommendation, & he literally insisted on coming to help. This guy is the real deal, and his waiting room is always packed with repeat customers whom he & his family know by name. I almost don't want to tellyou about him. But he deserves the praise!

Whoo hoo! A friend from  Nogales brought me one of these tortas 4 years ago & I've been hooked since.  Gustavo (the owner) & his lovely wife and their 2 cute kids are the beginning of this great experience.  EVERYTHING here is good and a whole lot cheaper than many bona fide Mexican places.  My favorite is the Pollo Ahogado, aka Drowned Chicken Torta.  It has avocado,just a few jalapenos (and is the only way I've ever been able to eat those), and the most amazing red sauce. I ask for the salsa INSIDE the sandwich just to be sure.  You will need 15-20 napkins and may not be able to conquer the whole thing if you're a chica like me.  By the way.....if you go in here twice, you get treated like a friend. They are awesome.  Oh! And the "Boing" juices are from one of the only union-run beverage cooperatives in Mexico.  :)  They 're good, too.

Good selection; good prices...........CREEPY! This place has no EMPLOYEES! Plus, everything was wrapped in cellophane - it might be easy- but it's not fresh! Plus,  they pay the few workers they have NOTHING, and then expect them to do twice the job.  I won't go back.   Safeway has a growing Organics section & their Organics just won a national industry award! Whoo hoo!

C'mon CenPho'ers! Fresh & Easy?? The creepy British grocery w/ everything wrapped in cellophane? The odd selection of random mass-market brand names on different aisles? The anti-union corporate policy? Ya'll have more heart than that!

My first venture into the new fro yo generation.  Love the many flavors & my allergic-to-everything toddler gets dairy free plus fruit. The chain with organic fruit will get my loyalty.  Mojo a little pricier than others, if closer to home.  BUT on Tuesdays, sign up on FB for the secret word and get 50% off!  UPDATE to 5 STARS. I miss Mojo so bad. And they had good prices! I am paying 2- damn- fifty for a freakin' soft serve cone from a truck, and 5 bucks for a froyo cone in NY. Go to Mojo. And be grateful.

Very tasty and more reasonably. Priced than mojo. But....for my food-allergic toddler, no dairy free! ! :( had to load him up w/ fruit and candy. Alas. We got free kid spoons, too.

Great owners, Ralph & wife know their Hebrew National quality dogs! But my favorite is the delicious breakfast burrito tucked into a handmade tortilla!
