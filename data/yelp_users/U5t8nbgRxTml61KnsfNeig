This was a great way to end my stay in Arizona! It was also the first time I saw any Chinese people in Phoenix. Located in the Chinese Cultural Center of Phoenix, Szechwan Palace has delicious Chinese food (reminds me of home), and is located close to the airport if you're looking for a quick and delicious meal.   My mom's friend took me here for a quick dinner before dropping me off at the airport. She goes there often so the waitstaff already knew her favorite dish and bantered a bit, teasing me because of my Taiwanese accented Mandarin and because I can't read Simplified Chinese (it's so confusing though, with all the straight lines and boxiness...). The food was great, the inside clean (light wood floors and tables and white painted walls, making it feel very spacious and airy).    We ordered:   1. Wu Gen Chang Wan - I don't know the English name of this, but it's a stew of pigs intestine, pig's blood, leek, white cabbage (the one in kimchi), and red peppers. It was the perfect kind of spice, that warms your mouth, but didn't distract from the flavor of the pickled vegetables, the lightly textured blood, and the flavor of the intestine. The intestines were extremely tender without any chew to them, so you could bite right through and taste the fat and the flavor. It wasn't even stinky at all.   2. Yi Xiang Eggplant - Your usual eggplant from a Chinese restaurant, but with a Szechwan kick. Japanese eggplant sliced and lightly fried in a sauce that was mildly spicy with a hint of sweetness. It had small pieces of minced pork as well. The eggplant was not too fried or burnt on the outside, but well-done and soft on the inside.   3. Hong Shao Pai Gu - This is like a braised pork ribs, served with whole shiitake mushrooms and sliced bamboo shoots. Some of the meat was a little tough, but the overall flavor was great (mostly soy sauce, maybe a little tamarind). This dish was NOT spicy, so it was a good break for my mouth in between the other dishes.   4. Bo Cai - Sauteed spinach with garlic. Fairly typical, the kind of spinach that makes your teeth feel like they've been scraped. Good to get a little green in  there.   The atmosphere was pretty nice and conducive to a conversation. Apparently you can request more spice; I didn't know that or I would have. I guess this is the usual mild level that they give to new customers.   It seemed the place was very popular; there were constantly people coming in and out, and several families with small children, which the staff was very accommodating to (with booster seats and high chairs). There were also many Chinese patrons, which is always a good sign. It was also nice to hear conversational Mandarin around me after so long...  If I ever return to Phoenix, I'm coming straight here to get a real Chinese food fix!

The first place in two weeks where I've felt welcome in Phoenix!   My boyfriend finally came to visit, and after my two trying weeks of lectures and starting student-teaching, I wanted a treat, even though I had just caught a cold from one of my students. We had been back-and-forth yelping, and Lo-Lo's was something we knew we definitely had to try.... but we had no idea how to get there from ASU in Tempe. After trying for half an hour to use the Valley Metro Trip Planner (which gets a NEGATIVE 4 stars for being completely unintuitive and impossible!), we called Lo-Lo's and were immediately giving light rail and bus directions.   After probably an hour and a half, during which we are getting hungrier and hungrier, and all our conversation is redirecting to fried chicken, we walk in the door and are immediately welcomed and told to sit whereever we like. We grab a table, and are offered drinks. I got a re-fillable jar of some of the best sweet tea I've ever had (although walking three blocks in 100 degree weather may have biased that opinion sometime), and we also got two ice waters to rehydrate. We looked at the menu and immediately knew what we wanted. I ordered the soul food platter, 3 pieces of fried chicken, cornbread, and sides of mac n'cheese and collard greens. Daniel ordered the Lil' Amadi, which was 1 leg and 1 thigh with a waffle, and a side of red beans (no rice).   Okay. So. I don't like waffles. I'm used the Belgian waffles, which are way too huge and fill me up with bread taste and make me feel bloated. Lo-Lo's waffle blew me away; it literally was like buttery, slightly mealy, air. I kept stealing bites until I basically ate the whole thing, drenched in maple syrup and fluffy whipped butter. The red beans and collard greens were incredible! We both agreed that they were our favorites of the whole meal (two former vegans... haha): the beans had a touch of sweetness, simultaneously savory and tender. The collards had basically no bitterness at all, but weren't super salty. They were tender and cut into small slices that perfectly combined into a side-appropritate mouthfull. The mac n'cheese was pretty good but I didn't really focus on its taste. The chicken! Oh my god. I've never had breast meat that was still juicy. Incredible texture, the tenderness of the meat and the crispness of the skin juxtaposed. This place definitely blows Roscoe's out, and as a native LA-er, I'm sorry to say it.   The price is really great, less than 30 altogether, and we left a large tip because the service was so great! We felt so welcomed by the staff, and we could tell that they were having a chill time as well, singing along to Justin Timberlake in the next room. The only downside (not on their end) was that because of my slight cold, I couldn't taste all the flavors as well as I could have otherwise; that's the only reason this isn't getting a 5, and I can see myself changing that... I also cursed myself for forgetting my camera. I guess that means that I'll have to make another trip out there before I'm out of this desert.

First of all, Google Maps, your walking directions to get here are wrong, wrong, WRONG. My boyfriend and I walked in the completely wrong direction down University, following the directions Google gave me, until we called Blue Nile and were told the cross streets were Rural and University: in the opposite direction. It is hot here, okay? I'm sorry we don't drive but that is no reason to punish us.   We ended up getting there around 1030 in the morning (early risers) and were confused by the sign on the door saying they opened at 12 PM, when the phone-answerer had just told us 11. They did, however, open their doors at 11, when we entered and were greeted by Marly (sp?), who asked us if we were here for Ethiopian or Raw food, because the raw menus weren't printed yet (new menus weekly-a good sign!) We chose to read over the Ethiopian menu and decide on any additional raw items later. Since we were the first ones there, she asked us where we would like to sit, and we opted for the bright dining room with wooden tables, yellow-orange painted walls, and colorful art and carvings. The other room, with lower wicker seats and curtains, looked very cute, but with much less light, and we wanted to see the food as we enjoyed it.   What we ordered (caveat--I'm recovering from a cold so my tastebuds are not at their best; you may want to read Daniel's review of the same meal when he gets to Yelp):   1) Ethiopian black tea - this was an unsweetened iced tea, but still very refreshing, with the wonderful scent of and slight taste of cardamom and cloves. They did not even laugh when I poured (and spilled) some of the tea into my water bottle because it was so good.   2) Sambusas - we started with one order of collards and potato sambusas (one for each of us). The skin was much thinner than the Somalian sambusas that we're used to, and the filling was much less spicy. The yogurt-based dipping sauce, however, was incredible and really enhanced the dish, although it too was mildly spiced.   3) Vegan combo - We got the chickpeas, red lentils, eggplant, collard greens, and split peas combo, which is technically for one but was definitely enough for the both of us. They are all delicious although, again, not as spicy as I was hoping for (again, tastebuds and sinuses may be at fault). My two favorites were the split peas and collards. The eggplant was not as soft as I like (I only liked eggplant if it is mushy, personal preference), and the red lentils were too sweet. The best part, of course, was the injera on top of which the food was served, when the flavors have soaked into the little pockets.   4) Raw desserts: Persian Cashew Custard and Raw Banana Ice Cream. I'm not a dessert person but Daniel definitely loved them. The texture of the custard was great, very creamy, and I think it had a touch of saffron. The banana ice cream basically tasted like cold banana to me, with a raw chocolate syrup that I really loved.   The service, by the way, rocked! Marly was so attentive and nice, coming up to us often and ready to answer any question. Admittedly, there were not many other people, but I noticed her giving that same degree of attention to a woman who was clearly a regular. I will definitely be back sometime in the next 3 weeks that I'm stuck here in Tempe, to enjoy the excellent food, ambience, and company.

To celebrate the end of institute, and leaving Phoenix, my collaborate work group decided to have a celebratory dinner. There were 9 of us in all, and so it was suggested that we come here. Cool, whatever, brewery.   First of all, the service was extremely helpful and attentive. From the beginning, our main server asked us how we would break down the check, and if it were possible to consolidate credit cards among us so we'd be able to get out faster. She was very polite and ready to accommodate, even though she was training someone new at the same time.    When we arrived, someone immediately took our drink orders. Most of us started with cocktails, and 2 people got beers--big mistake on the majority. The Manhattan and Tom Collins my friends got were extremely watered down, with very little alcohol, and my SF lemonade tasted like lemonade. Only. Apparently the beers, though, were very good, and the next round, that's what everyone ordered.   As a group we decided to split appetizers: A chef's platter (with Southwest Chicken Eggrolls, barbecue buffalo wings, and potstickers), and 2 baskets of garlic fries. We were all starving after our last day teaching so we dove in as soon as the food arrived. The buffalo wings were sweet and barely spicy at all, although the chicken had a nice crispness to it. The Southwestern eggrolls were bland, so I dipped them in ranch, and the garlic fries were very greasy--the garlic was minced and spread over the fries, so there wasn't much flavor and since it was raw minced, somewhat intense.  At this point, we were starting to get full, when our entrees actually arrived. I tried:   Beer battered fish and chips - The fish was NOT beer battered. It was breaded. Your generic whitefish, a texture as if fried after freezing, but drier than usual because of the breading. It was served with a mound of those same garlic fries and a "Cajun roumalade"--basic, orange tarter sauce that just tasted like tarter. I had to add a lot of vinegar and Tabasco to make this taste like anything.  Marzen bacon burger - I had a bite of my friend's burger and it was pretty good: nicely charred meat, crisp bacon. I like my meat a little rare, though, and the burger was well-done all the way through, and a little tougher than my preference.   Steak sandwich (don't know the actual name) - Another friend had a steak sandwich, which was a steak cooked medium rare with caramelized onions, a garlic alioli (or so she said, I couldn't taste it), gorgonzola, and arugula on a French roll, and the same ubiquitous garlic fries. The steak was pretty tasty and the sharp gorgonzola complemented it well. I could barely taste the arugula, however, and was in fact convinced it was actually spinach.   Other people all had about the same to say about their food. It was too much and kind of bland. The portions of the food were pretty ridiculous. I know its a brewery but the plate was twice the size of my head.   For a watery cocktail and mediocre food, I paid about 26 bucks, which to me is just too much for something I'm unsatisfied with. 1 star for the service, 1 star for the ambience, which was pretty conducive to a group dinner (even with the Nascar racing on the flatscreens poised all about us). No stars for the drinks, the food, and the price.

My mom, her friend, and I had dinner at VinciTorio's last night, and what a great dinner it was. A Pilates instructor actually suggested it to my mom and so, as a loyal Yelper, I called my boyfriend and had him check the reviews. Good prices and food? We're there.   We showed up around 7 without having called ahead to find that there was a small line of people ahead of us. The restaurant was packed with families and elderly people. A good sign. We waited and chatted with the hostess, who gave us some recommendations off the menu of her favorite items. The decor was really cute, all I can really think of to call it is busy. Lots of family photographs, fake vines and leaves, painted walls. Even the bathroom has some framed photos of someone's baby, which I found hilarious. There was also some live music, from a guitarist singing covers of sappy soft rock love songs (I'm not going to lie, yes I do know all the lyrics to "I'll Be". Judge me.)   We were seated quickly and immediately brought water. Our server's name was Josh and he came right after the buser left to ask us about drinks. None of us wanted any wine or anything and he was super polite and did not judge (appreciated), and took our calamari appetizer order while giving us time to further peruse the menu. He came back with a drink for my mom's friend and a basket of delicious bread: garlic bread on a toasted baguette, and some focaccia with tomato and basil sauce. I decided on their lasagna, my mom's friend got the seafood fettucine, and my mom ordered eggplant parmesan.   The calamari arrived and it was so frickin' good! The spicy marinara sauce was fresh and had huge chunks of tomatoes and a liberal sprinkling of dried peppers in it. The calamari was in large spiraled chunks (rather than the tiny ringed slices you usually get), with a light crispy breading. We finished it off right away with the bread; there is olive oil and balsamic vinegar at the table for you to mix yourself, and we definitely partook in it with the bread. Lots of grease, I know. We were then brought salads and soup; I had a Ceaser salad that had too much parmesan on it, and they both had the Italian wedding soup, which was like an Italian albondigas: a tiny orvo looking pasta, shredded veggies, white beans, and tiny meatballs. They both loved the soup.   At this point, we're already starting to fill up, when our entrees arrived. My mom's friend's pasta came in a large bowl: jumbo shrimp, clams, and mussels on fettucine, drizzled with a light tomato broth. My mom's eggplant parmesan had penne and a vegetable mix (not canned, but sliced and steamed zucchini, summer squash, and carrots).   The eggplant parm was great; I disagree with the review below that says eggplant parmesan is supposed to be cut thick. I've never been to Italy so I can't speak to that level of authenticity, but every Italian deli that I've been to slices the eggplant thinly, breads it, and then stacks it on thick. This is because eggplant has mild toxins it, people. It's purple for a reason-you're not supposed to eat it raw, EVER, and if it's cut thick and not fully cooked to softness, that chewy eggplant texture means it still retains some toxicity.   My lasagna was deliciosu and definitely very fresh; the ricotta was fragrant with basil, and the homemade pasta was extremely tender. There was too much mozzarella at the top but I think I'm just picky; I peeled the mozzarella off the eggplant as well because that much cheese really masks the taste for me. We were all too full to even come close to finishing, so we picked and picked until just packing it up.   Appetizer, one soft drink, and 3 dinner time entrees for $60. How's that for a nice evening?   Commendations again, on the service, the food, and an overall extremely pleasant experience. The ambience is very nice, and I could see this being a lovely place for a date or to bring your family to. It makes me feel good to support a family-owned business that is so welcoming to their clientele.

I'm really disappointed in this LA Fitness location.   My mom came to visit me in Tempe for the weekend. She's an LA Fitness member in Los Angeles, and in the past, when at home, I've used the guest pass to go to her gym and have never had any trouble.   I should have known when we got to the plaza and the space looked tiny: a one story space in a strip mall. Hm... Oh well. We went inside with the printed pass from their website and the guy at the front desk, took my ID, and then informed me that because I'm not an Arizona resident, I couldn't be a guest. Uhhh, it didn't say that online. But it was posted on their front desk so okay, I can accept that, maybe it was a policy change. The two men at the front (Garrett and Dylan, I believe), called over their manager to see if they could do something to get me in for free. The manager (Jimmy) said he could give me $20 for 2 weeks, but when I told him I was only there for 1 more week, he said I had to just pay $15 for a day's membership. Fine, I'm here, I want to work out. My mom, however, kept asking, because in LA, their customer service will ALWAYS let her bring people in, even if they are from out of the country; she has never encountered the residence rule before. Jimmy The General Manager was so unaccommodating and didn't even listen to her concerns. Hello, your JOB is in customer service.  I didn't want to go into it any further so we went in to change.  Damn. As has been said, this gym is super small. It's only 2 rooms, really, one glassed off for classes, the other with all the machines (very basic, mostly treadmills and a couple of machines and a weights section); the ellipticals are in the lobby. Really. My mom took a Pilates class. She said the instructor was really good and made the class pretty easy for beginners. The instructor actually even gave us a recommendation for dinner that we did in fact go to and was great. The room itself was extremely cramped and it was warm inside, even with AC blasting, because there were a lot of people all standing near each other. The people we did meet, however, were pretty friendly; one pair at the weights gave my mom and I some tips and were really nice.   When we left, the two men at the front desk did say bye and gave me a slip so I could come again today, and max out my 24-hour use. I plan to, because I did have to pay. However, I would not otherwise visit here again.   1 star for the customer service at the front and the pilates instructor. No stars for the manager not being helpful, poor and awkward layout, and lack of equipment.

Spending time in this area with other people make it a lot more bearable. Something else that makes it bearable-Yelping good food.   My mom was leaving this morning and she wanted me to look up a good place for breakfast. We settled on Crackers & Co Cafe because it was close to her friend's house and we could pick her up. On the way over, though, my mom saw people were waiting outside and dropped me off so I could start waiting--good thinking! They took my name and told me it would be about 15 minutes.  20 minutes later, my mom and her friend arrived just as my name was called. We were seated promptly in a corner table under the some windows, with convenient view of 2 flat-screen televisions, both broadcasting CNN. A little distracting but whatever.   We were seated around 11 AM and by then my mom and I were no longer in the mood for breakfast foods. My mom's friend started with a Mango Iced Tea and I got the Strawberry Peach Iced Tea. They came quickly but tasted like something from a fountain or mix; very sweet and cool, but almost no tea-taste. They tasted fine, but I'm not sure that it was actually a fresh iced tea as it said on the menu.   We ordered:   Half-sandwich and soup: My mom got half a roast beef and provolone on wheat sandwich, with a bowl of Clam Chowder (usually only on Fridays but it was the Soup du Jour today). The roast beef was sliced very thin but there was a good amount, so much that my mom deconstructed her sandwich. The beef had a good texture but the sandwich overall was pretty bland. The clam chowder was delicious, thick and creamy but somehow still appropriate for a warm day because of the huge chunks of clams and mealy potato. Add a little Cholula and I'm all there (stole a lot of spoonfulls, actually).  Belgian Waffle: My mom's friend asked if the toppings were fresh and the waitress answered honestly that the blackberries and blueberries were frozen but the strawberries were fresh. It came hot off the griddle with butter and a good amount of topping, but no syrup--we had to ask and someone else, I believe a manager, brought it over promptly.   The Californian - I'm eating the leftovers of this sandwich as we speak.. which is roasted chicken breast, red onions, sprouts, avocado, tomato, and mayo on whole wheat bread. It was served with some really delicious fries; very crispy with a difficult to describe crustiness to it. Trust me, very good. The sandwich had a lot of flavor but you want to eat the pickle that comes with it for sure, to bring it together. I should've asked for mustard to be added but forgot. (Also, I just want to know why California-style food is associated with avocado? I love me some avo but it's not like Californians put it on their steak and in their drinks or something.)   Overall, the food was pretty good for the price, the service attentive, and the place busy but still conducive to pleasant conversation. Oh, and free refills on the drink. Hopefully I'll get another chance to eat here before I leave.
