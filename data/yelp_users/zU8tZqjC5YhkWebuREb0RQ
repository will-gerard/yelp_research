They did our hair, and my makeup for our wedding, and made me feel beautiful on that special day, wow, almost 8 years ago now.  They are consistent with the quality of service they provide.  I always leave feeling about three feet off the ground.  I  love the complimentary aromatherapy massage, and the iced cappuccino is a must! This really is a gem of a salon, some of the friendliest stylists, and good atmosphere hands down. Love the folks at Perry Monge.

The food is fantastic! Fresh and so flavorful.  I love the communal seating and openness inside.  Chips and salsa were great.  My enchilada plate was creamy and flavorful! I tried my first chulata here!

I had my Phat Cruiser tuned up there,  the  guys did a fantastic job, and were laid back and courteous.  I love that my cruiser feels like new again.  Thanks guys!!  Because of that great experience I brought a newly purchased single gear bike here to have a new saddle installed.  The nice gentleman helping noticed the stripped hex bolt on the seat post and replaced it, then proceeded to adjust the brake, and brake lever, AND then put air in the tires, and fit me to the seat/bike.  All that cost just under ten dollars which was super awesome! AS soon as I got home, I pulled my bike out of the jeep, and went for a ride! What a huge difference in the overall performance and comfort.  I can feel the difference, in that there no longer any tension in my back.  I will be bringing my road bike back for a tune up, and purchasing here from now on.

Fantastic service, friendly and professional staff.  They put out enough sunblock to coat / protect your face after a peel.  Very pleasant experience :) thank you Phoenix Skin!

The fish is always tasty and they have gotten the fries a bit crispier.  I ordered the 2 piece whiting and chips and its really delicious. The fish js cooked perfectly. The breading is nice and light and crispy while the fish is tender and flaky.  The fried okra is tasty.  The hush puppies are a lil done but still taste good. The cole slaw is good. Cant way to try the sweet potato pie!

Fish is great, service sucks! Second time coming here and waiting and waiting and waiting and nobody ever came. Never coming back. Going to Rose and Crown to salvage whats left of my lunch hour.

Chicas caliente, fresh tasty food and awesome margaritas, per my husband.  Lol. Strong and tasty house margaritas.  I had half, and was buzzed, proceeded to pass the delicious other half to my better half. a My husband commented on feeling his first margarita.  And he can hold his liquor.  Drinks legit!  To legit to quit! Haha. This place is pretty damn good.  The veggie tacos and chili relleno burrito are delicious! The accompanied red and green sauce are hot and flavorful!  Can't wait to come back! Thanks for the suggestion Lalo!

This is a favorite spot downtown for great service, beer and food.  The happy hour specials are fantastic.  They have a wonderful beer selection.  And hands-down  the best tasting fully loaded Bloody Mary ( won Best of Phoenix).

I love the food here.  have had cornish pasty in Bathe, England and fell in love with these little pockets of goodness.  I love that they have a great selection for veggies and meat-eaters alike.  I like that you have the option for communal seating, and love the BIG steins of beer!  The servers are always pleasant and I cannot wait until the one on Monroe street opens!

It's nice having a Chinese /Sushi restaurant in South Phoenix.  The staff are always friendly and provide great service.  The happy hour is fantastic, and I was so pleased when they added a sushi bar. A few of my favorite menu items include; hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, Spicy Saigon noodles, Kung Pao Tofu, vegetable egg foo young, eel (unagi)roll, spicy tuna roll, dragon roll, and sashimi yellowtail. The quality and taste is always consistently good.

This is a gem of a restaurant in South Phoenix.  We have been eating here for years, and never anything less than fantastic food and wine.  The mushroom pizza is delicious.  The goat cheese stuffed peppadeaux, and the rajas gratin are my favorite appetizers.  They have a great wine menu.  And the balsamic strawberry dessert was amazing! Nice balance of tart and sweet.

The food is good.  But i'm always missing something when from my order.  They always remember to charge for a side or something else but fail to include it.  This was the last time Im going here.  This has happened to many times.

I like The Rose and Crown.  Has the true British Pub feel.  Good selection of beers.  Food is pricey for what it is.  Atmosphere is great!

We went with friends who frequent this restaurant and love it.  It was worth the drive from Downtown Phoenix.  I had the cold noodles bowl and my husband had the hot rice bowl (don't recall the names).  I have been enjoying leftovers for the last two days.

If you can get seated next to the salsa bar then SCORE!! Lol.  So many tasty salsa's to choose from! Try them all!! Basically everything is amazing! The veggie tacos are delicious!  I love the peanut salsa and cilantro salsa.  The house margarita is big, fresh squeezed with citrus pieces to nibble on, and its so delicious!  My favorite menu item is the quesa!! The marin and the veggie are loaded with flavor! Oh, and try they guacamole! They put cranberries and jicama in it :)

The Argentinean Po Boy, The Big Wac, and Seitan Wings are fantastic comfort food to me.   I cant go to Green without splitting a order of the wings with my husband.  We lick the basket clean, haha.  On the advice of a friend, I recently tried the Kaisor Söze Reuben weekly special,  and hope it is added to the menu. LOVED IT!!  We live in South Phoenix and its so nice having one in the central Phoenix area.

Rude, Snotty, and FAR from thorough are the first words that come to mind.  Dr Lorio acted bothered when I asked in depth questions surrounding the very peel she recommended, and told me she doesn't do  peels, so I would need to talk to her assistant.  Did she direct me to her assistant? No, she told me to make an appointment and sent me on my way.  I was shocked by how uppity a so called "professional" would treat a patient.  A horrible unprofessional experience.  Won't be going back EVER!

Vegetarian number three is delicious, and more than enough for two people.  First time here, we ordered the coffee.  Hand roasted for you while you wait. So be patient.  It's only a hour and its well worth it.  It feels like I'm in someones house, and I love that homey relaxed feeling!  The prices are cheaper than Lali Bela, and the flavorful food and tentative service is what will bring me back. Cannot wait until next time! Really great experience.

The BEST Thai restaurant in Phoenix.  The staff are friendly, and make you feel at home. The food AMAZING!! Try the pineapple red curry, drunkin noodles, and coconut curry soup (those are my favorite). My husband and I have a spicy palate, so we ordered the soup at a heat level of 4, and the curries at a 5, and it was a perfect blend of heat and flavor. Enjoy!

This is the real deal.  You order a level 5 in heat, your getting the Thai level of 5..... I usually stick with a 4 knowing the left overs will be at a 10heat level in taste the next day...Love that we have an amazing Cozy lil Thai restaurant in South Phoenix.   The coconut soup with veggies, hands down the most delicious in Phoenix.  I  have to order that to share everytime we order from Chan Pen.  I love the curries, but the Panang is my personal favorite.   Try the Drunkin Noodles at a 4 in heat and enjoy a spicy delight!  :) If you dine in, you may find a complimentary dessert on your table at the end of that delicious meal.  Save some room.

Everything WE have had here is nothing short of fantastic! I get excited at the thought of coming here, and think of all the options I have to look forward to.  Never disappointed.  I had a long day at work today and decided to stop in and get take out on my way home.  They gave me a water bottle and a fantastic bowl of coconut ice cream on the house, while I waited for my order.  Love Chan Pen!!!!

This is one of my favorite spots!  I am hooked on the spud tacos.  The pizzas are also very delicious, and of course the amazing selection of craft beer.  I have enjoyed everything from Meade to Sours to IPA's and Stouts and everything in between :)

LOVE LoVE LOVE The Perch!  Very laid back atmosphere.  The patio has all kinds of exotic birds, shade trees and misters going to keep the patio feeling 20 degrees cooler than it was in the sweltering heat last Sunday!  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.  He recommended the Perch house made sour beer and it was so delicious that I left with a growler of it.  This was definitely worth the drive from South Phoenix.  Cant wait to come back!!

Disgusted!!!!!! If you want a less than halfass shitty job, go here.  Spent 55 bucks for a oil change, and car wash, and this is the car wash result!!  They didn't wipe anything down and didn't clean windows.  I still have dirty windows, WTF Jacksons! You suck! Waste of money.  Going to go check my oil and see if they even changed it!!!! DO NOT GO HERE! Calling management to demand a refund on the wash. This is ridiculous!

Loooooove this quant lil house.  You can sit out front, inside which is very cozy or outside in the back yard which is very adorable and has lots of shade.  The giant beans and brussel sprouts is perfect for folks wanting a more savory breakfast.  The savory crepe is another favorite

Woohoo! We are so happy that we have a Barros in the area; and no longer have to drive out to Laveen or Tempe to get our Barros on!  . I love the thin crust, and my husband prefers regular or deep dish crust.  This is where the 19.99 two large one topping pizza deal comes into play. We each get to pick a pizza with the topping/s and crust we like.  Both are happy campers at the end of the meal:)

The staff is very friendly, and the service is great.  The food is all made from scratch! From the tortillas to the mole.  I wanted a chile relleno burrito, and although not on the menu, they made me one.  And ooooooh wow! It was the best chile relleno burrito that I have ever had.  It came with some grilled onions, and a roasted jalapeno on the side.  I enjoyed them with the burro.  I was also given a sample of the molè. It paired so perfect with the burrito. I think ill be going back for dinner, and having the same meal, but this time enchilada style with the mole sauce.

The beer was delicious, and the food amazing!!! The blackberry wheat beer was smooth, and the blackberry flavor danced along my tastebuds.  The Oodham fry bread dish is fantastic.  White tepary bean puree, and topped with the most amazing selection of pickled vegetables that I have ever had including pickled grapes!!  Three of us shared this amazing dish.  Next time I won't be sharing, lol.  It was superb!!! The chef is a genius! Don't take my word for it, get your behind on down there!
