This place had good reviews on yelp and Google, which baffles me. Took my daughter in here for what we suspected to be a bladder infection. The doctor looked her over and said we would have results within four days, which is pretty long considering they started her on antibiotics just in case. A week and a half went by and we heard nothing. We called the doctors office and asked for the results. We were told we would get a call back from the Dr. Another week later and we have heard nothing. NOTHING! They put her on an entire round of antibiotics and never even bothered to give us the results of her lab tests which we paid for. I am flabbergasted. I will never take my kids here again, I've never been so disappointed in a pediatrician in my life.  This office clearly does not care about retaining new customers.

Update! One month later, and STILL never got a call!! Either they lost the lab results or they don't care, either way it is extreme incompetence.

We absolutely love this place! We make it a point to visit here every date night because the gelato is so delicious and the staff is so friendly. Don't let the fact it is a small shop in a strip mall turn you off, once you go in and taste the gelato you will not regret having visited this place. This is a business I hope stays for a long time in Mesa.  One of my absolute favorite places to go when I want something sweet.

This place is sooooo good.  It threw me off when I first saw it because it is nothing more than a tiny seafood bar in the middle of a casino.  You are steps away from slot machines.  However, the food is so good it is worth it.  Spicy and full and just delicious.  I have been here several times and always leave satisfied.  If you like cajun food and you love seafood, you owe it to yourself to try this gem of a place!

Wow.  I was so impressed with this place!  Came here for a date night and it delivered.  The atmosphere was romantic and the service impeccable.  Our server let us sample some barrel cocktails, which was helpful because they were strong and I didn't end up buying a drink I wouldn't have been able to drink.  They give you free bread.  Not a big deal you say?  Maybe not, but I've been to a lot of nice restaurants that make you starve while waiting for your food, so it is nice when a place doesn't nickel and dime you into starvation.  Am I right?  So we had the fondue for an appetizer and some happy hour cocktails. If you like Swiss cheese, you'd dig the fondue, otherwise maybe choose something else.  The Cherry tart pinot noir is fab IMHO.  So I bit the bullet and ordered the chopped salad.  OMG.... nosh-a-licious!  It was really, really good.  The mixture of textures and flavors was so satisfying and, I'm not going to lie, I don't get all that jazzed up over salads usually.  My husband had the special - the fillet burger - and I'm pretty sure his eyes rolled into the back of his head in delight.  I believe the exact quote was, "This is the best burger I've ever had".  I have seen how many burgers this man has eaten, and trust me, that is high praise.  Service - five stars!  Food - five stars!  Drinks - Five again.  Would come back here happily.

The Yard was a bit of an overwhelming experience for me.  We had reserved 'outdoor' seats at Little Cleo's, not realizing that outdoor actually means in the yard.  Being in the yard on a Saturday night is certainly one of those things you should be prepared for.  For the amount of money spent on our meal, it was disappointing that conversation was difficult over the roar of the crowd.  Very reminiscent of my college days, and spending time in a bar on Mill.  I could barely hear the server!   While waiting for our table (20 min wait with reservations) we sauntered over to the bar that services the yard and Culinary Dropout.  My husband's beer cost as much as my mojito.  It wasn't that the mojito was cheap, but the fact they charged a crazy amount for a beer.  It was almost 8 bucks.  The worst part, as others have said, is the parking.  Valet was full, so we had to park across the street in a shopping center and run across five lanes of traffic.   I will say that once I accepted that I wasn't going to be having a fine dining experience (though I certainly paid for it) I was able to just sit back and enjoy the people watching.  This place was fun for people watching.  There were bikers, ping-pongers, and that funny drunk guy who was laughing way too loud at his own jokes.  So, essentially the Yard provided dinner and a show.  The cover band playing at Culinary was a fun touch too.  All in all, I had fun.  That being said, I will probably never go back.

After leaving my first review, the manager, Mike Donaldson, contacted me and was concerned that my experience was not the norm.  In my mind, that kind of follow through shows incredible customer service, so we made a return visit to Little Cleos.  We sat inside this time and it was so much better.  It has a cool 1920's nautical vibe going on.  The manager was so nice and our server was amazing.  The service was some of the best I have experienced.  She didn't hesitate to recommend some of her favorite dishes and she was spot on.  The crab in a jar is fabulous.  I had a cocktail called the Subtle Menace which was CRAZY good.   The cajun shrimp was spicy - just how I like it and my hubby had the NY Strip which came covered in a crab sauce.  Delish.  Pumpkin fritters were like home made donuts like my mom in law makes, but with more pizazz.  Overall, I am glad we gave this place a second chance.  It was immensely better this time and judging from how happy the servers all seemed, and how in tune the manager was with his staff and customers, I'm pretty sure our first experience was just a fluke.  I was more than impressed with Little Cleos and will return.   Of all the things I've tried, I still recommend the bouillabaisse and kale salad because they were out of this world.
