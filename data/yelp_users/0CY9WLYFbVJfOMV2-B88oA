Went shopping for a dress last minute! Went to Arizona bridal, they were fantastic! The sales person was very friendly and accommodating! The have a large variety of dresses and have plenty in each size. Found a wonderful gown for a GREAT price! This place is absolutely no pressure, they helped me try one a zillion dresses which was unusual and were very helpful, they didn't seem rushed!  Great place to go for a dress!! YAY

Nice atmosphere, great staff only place I can find Top Gear magazine!!  I think this is what Borders is known for, having a broader selection. This magazine is published in Britain and it's hard to find in the states.

Fast service! If you want to grab some fantastic food like a calzone or pasta and have limited time! This is the perfect place for you! People with 30min to an hour for lunch it's perfect! They also have my favorite local brew SanTan brewing co sunspot gold, goes well with the calzone! Scotty, two to beem up! Yummy!

Had another Great Quick meal here. The calazone with mushrooms' olives & ricotta Cheese. Delicious! As luck would have it they were also televising the EPL Arsenal Vs. Tottenham Hotspur match. I lingered here alittle while longer to watch. While enjoying the game, I had a few good blonde ales from a great local brewery and really enjoyed my calazone. This is a nice little local place to eat great food on the go and enjoy a few surprises as well. Cheers!

So where do I start? There was a long line to get in, so the foods has got to be good. Only problem is that I never made it inside to eat! My friend and I arrived and it wasn't what i had expected. I thought it would be a local neighborhood bar with good food. It's not, it's a tinie tiny diner that looked kind of dumpy. We walked in and added our names to the long list. We tried waiting inside but the ogling from the sex predator cook made it strange and we had to sit outside. After waiting for 10 min the hostess came out and was looking for a party that had already left due to the wait, she called their name and when there wasn't a response she just grabbed a couple that had just arrived.! What ! This place is crap! We were waiting!! We ended up leaving and going to Liberty Market, now that place is great! Sorry I hate leaving bad reviews, but it was a terrible experience.

My husband visiited this place yesterday for lunch even though I told him of my poor experience.  He came back with an even worse story than mine! EEWWWW!  Lets just say that he'd be doing a service to the good people of Gilbert if he called the health inspector.  GORDON RAMSAY WHERE ARE YOU? I know lets send Man Vs. Food into this place, on second thought, no one derserves this type of punisment!

This is actually a great place to wash your car! I've never had my oil changed there so I can't speak to what the other reviewer mentioned. I get the 24.99 car wash, but they always have a coupon for 5 dollars off making the wash 19.99. They do such a great job, it's almost if the car has been detailed. It's always very quick, I don't have to wait around to long which is great, but they have the Slurpee machine which always catches my attention anyway. This cobblestone is no where near my home, I make a special trip to have my car washed here, I like it so much. They also have a dun-kin donuts inside! Can't be that bad of a place can it? :)

We stayed March 20th and 21st - it was my husbands birthday and our anniversary. I planned a quick get away - since my husband and I had been working so hard a quick "staycation" I thought is what we needed.  March 20th - we checked in a bit late 9:30pm 9:45pm as my we had just gotten off of work. Check in went well - we were assigned a King room with a patio which was just fine. We got to our room opened the balcony door and sat on the patio. We had an okay view to a courtyard - nothing very special, but we were together and that's all the mattered.   We ordered a sandwich from the market they have - as room service is not available 24/7. They indicated they would deliver within 30 min - around 1 hour goes by and I call back to find out the ETA -(thought they may be busy) they said they tried to deliver but we didn't answer........ We hadn't left the room at ALL- I think they just forgot about us or maybe didn't get the room number right - but they blamed us. I asked for them to knock harder or maybe you can call us when you're coming? Come on - help me out here!!!!  Shortly after my dry sandwich was delivered at around 12:30am - we get a visit from security. Indicating we were talking too loud and disturbing the other guests - we were on the patio and I guess we aren't allowed to use it after a certain time?   The security person made us feel like we were 20 year old kids on a tirade of booze and pot smoking - when in reality we were sitting on the patio chatting - nothing more. Security left - I called the operator and asked to speak to the manager on duty - they indicated there wasn't one and we'd be stuck talking to security..... This is a big place - with a lot of guests - No manager on duty?????  We this was NOT a great start to our anniversary/birthday staycation!!!  Bright and early the next morning - I am assuming the guest that had called security on us - had their children bouncing a basketball against our wall..... ARE YOU KIDDING ME. And we are a problem?   We went to the front desk asking to speak to the manager - we were told she was in a meeting. We left our names and room number. NOTHING - no follow up - NOTHING. So - we went again and asked for the manager a second time - not available.   It was terrible - not relaxing AT ALL. I felt like it was just a huge waste of money and time - all the effort I spent trying to surprise my husband and getting packed while working all at the same time - We all know the drill - but when you spend this much money - you expect much more.  This resort is very nice, but I think it's just family oriented. Not for adults wanting to get away - this was spring break and spring training is happening, but you should be able to accommodate everyone.  Don't go - save your money and go to the Valley Ho - this has never happened to me there and I'll gladly pay extra..

I took my parents to Bavarian Point on word of mouth. I should have used YELP!   I am sad to report that this was the worst experience I've ever had. From the moment we walked in - there was a lack of attention. I honestly thought it was a seat yourself type of place, because there was NO ONE, NO ONE in the front to great you. Now, I've never been to a German restaurant and it can be a bit overwhelming. I don't know what the hell to order! It made it worse that the menu was in German, I get that I am in a German place, but last I knew - we aren't taught German in school and when the person came around to take our order, I swear it was at least 30 min. Terrible!  While we were waiting for our mystery food my mom found a baby roach on the table! She trapped it under her water glass that was empty, due to lack of service - but THAT WAS IT!  We walked out - we had to...   All I can say is Good Luck to you if you eat there! May there not be any roaches in your food or table!  PROST!

We met a couple of friends of ours at Zur Kate for dinner. I was a bit leery due to the fact that Zur Kate is in the same strip mall as the Bavarian Point. My review for the Bavarian Point would have been a zero - due to the roach on the table! So needless to say - I didn't want to go.   We walked in the door and it looked like you just stepped in to someones home in Germany. It's was cute! I little bit Twin Peaks, but cute in an odd way. They had live music and plenty of tasty cold beer! The menu was NOT in German like at the Bavarian Point - Bonus for us Americans. The food was very good I was very impressed. I don't know much about German food so I relied on our friends who go there often.  If you are looking to try something new, like German food! This was a first for me. Head to Zur Kate and know you are going to have a tasty meal!

Great Happy Hour! Good beer selection, half price gourmet pizza and a comfortable atmosphere! Happy hour is 4 to 6 except on Tuesdays when they are closed. Great homemade lemonchello! Service is OK, this is why they didn't get 5 stars. People are friendly, but not very speedy. They have my favorite local beer on tap! Half price Pie and good beer - you cant really go wrong! Check out La Stalla~

What can I say ladies! You know we are all loyal to our hair ladies! I've been seeing mine for over 10 years! She was the first to dye my virgin hair and let me tell you it took her a full 2 years to do it! I trust my hair stylist Alyssa with my hair! I know you all know what I mean! I now go in and just let her do what she does best, we mainly chat the entire time. I have implicit trust! If you are new in town or are looking to change, try Alyssa at Hair Do. The prices are reasonable and she always does a great job!

Let's start with 30 great beers on tap. The list constantly changes to keep things fresh and let us not forget another 200 beers in bottles and can! Holy mama! This is the best beer selection in Scottsdale hands down! The atmosphere is comfortable and a little dive baresque but in a good way.. Knowledgeable staff, good pub food round out this unique little diamond In the rough.

Pipp Pipp Cheery-o ! It's a British Pub in Scottsdale! No, it's not RUBBISH! It's True!  We went to this little gem and it really did reminded me of a pub in London, very cool.   They had a great selection of beer, but they also have and amazing selection of vodka! All the Three Olives, except Mango, but who drinks that! STOLI galore and much much more!   The place has a really laid back feel - I think it would be an amazing Happy Hour location! I didn't get to sample the food - but I saw some sliders go by that looked to die for!   Definitely a place to check out!

This was my first time at Four Peaks Brewing!   Having the bright tanks and the brewing equipment right where you sit and drink their beer, was a fantastic idea. It makes the space look much larger and if you are anything like me - I like to know how they make the brew, with this set up you can see it right before your eyes!   I've recently made the AZ Peach my favorite summer time brew! It's so light and refreshing - you can taste the peach, but it's not overwhelming. If you don't believe me, Try it! You can most likely find it at one of your local restaurant and pubs. I frequent the Uncle Bears by our house they offer the tasty delight. AHH!!!  I haven't had much of the menu so I can't really say - but I really enjoyed the environment and I just can't believe I haven't been here before!!!  Don't wait! Check it out! I will update as soon as I have a proper meal, but their beer is so good, I expect the same!!  Until then Yelpers!

Perhaps the greatest Little Middle Eastern market & restaurant in the valley! The Hummus & Lebni are to DIE FOR, the Lamb is out of this world and the Feta cheese may be the freshest I have ever experienced. My favorite Med. cuisine location by far. I love that I can Buy everything I have just eaten at the market next door and prepare it at home as well. Only One Issue, PARKING IS TERRIBLE during busy hours.  This is a MUST SEE for anyone seeking this type of cuisine! GO NOW!  P.S. Dont  know why this review shows up in 2 places, oh well this place is worth it!

Everyone knows that I love pizza & vino, so if you share my love for a great  pie and a glass of grape juice look no further for your next big night out.  Classic Italian is well hidden under the clock tower in the Waterworks mall at Baseline/Lakeshore rd. in Tempe AZ. but well worth finding.  The pizzas are hand stretched & prepared in a wood fire brick oven using Pecan wood!  My favorte of the bunch is called the 4 Seasons, wow what a pizza.  The crust is delicate & thin, the house made sauce is wonrderful and there is always a reasonably priced bottle of wine to pair with everything on the menu.  The ambiance is comfortable and the service has always been good.  A great place for date night! DO IT!

Quiet possibly the most perfectly cooked Fillet Mignon I've ever had! A little pricey but for the quality and service, it was very well worth it!  Very nice wine selection, including an 06 Stags Leap petite syrah and a very fair price on Silver Oak Cabernet. Our side dishes included marinated mushrooms and a loaded baked potato, both were amazing, but way too much after such a large cut of beef.!! Service was really great and this is the only good thing about the NY NY. Overall A+

To start cocktail service in the casino is crap! By comparison Mandalay bay, their sister property is amazing! Rooms are OK, beds uncomfortable and shower tight. Down stairs in NYC restaurant area had nice atmosphere, service there was better. Slots were tight, compared to Mandalay bay.. Over all Mandalay bay their sister hotel is a much better value. More bang for your buck!

GREAT NEW HAPPY HOUR!  Ok, A great new place to do Happy Hour!  They just began this happy hour thing last month and it's been well worth the wait.  $2 drafts, $3 huge drafts, $3 wells & 1-4 Dollar appetizers.  They always feature the current Sam Adams seasonal & JIMMY BUFFET'S Land Shark Lager so there is always somthing nice to quench yoour thirst.   The greatest feature of all?   These specials can only be had at the bar, so NO SCREAMING CHILDERN to deal with!!! YAY!!!   REALLY!  Dosen't it just suck that parents think it's ok to subject other people to their poorly raised howling children? Won't have that problem doing happy hour here!!! YAY AGAIN!!! I'm a fan!!!

Super, Super COOL! I walked in and saw 125 beers on tap! WOW, I think I could be there all day - pass out and make another day out of it! Not that I would ever do that, but the thought just briefly passed through my mind.   There are loads of craft beer and then some of our old favorites, so something for everyone. What I liked the most is that there are two flights of beer to choose from - the normal flight which includes several IPA's, Ales and what not - I don't care for IPA's so I skipped this one!!! But woo hoo! They had a Belgian style flight - which is my total favorite!!   My flight had Goulden Drakk - Tripel Karmelite, Frambouise and a house Belgian that is made my SILLI! Too cool!   I was there with my husband and a friend of ours and we ordered a California roll and a spicy tuna roll! They are HUGE! These are not served in the traditional roll but it looked like a round layer cake! There was plenty for three people and some left over!   This was great fun! The music is always great at the Yardhouse with the great beer and food - Just a fun time waiting to happen!!!   See you soon Yardhouse!

Gonna go out on a limb here and recommend that you steer clear of this place. This is the 1st 1 star review I have ever given anyone. Located in downtown Gilbert, there are just entirely to many good places within walking distance to waste your time or hard earned $ in this pretentious little curio shop/bistro. The service is bad and rather cold, their knowledge of fine wine even worse. Whats with the trinket shop in the waiting area? Lets buy trinkets/junk while we are given attitude about where to wait for our table. Really? Our food arrived cold, our server rarely arrived at all & I got up to get my own water after giving up on ordering another glass of vino. SOMEONE CALL GORDON RAMSAY! This truly is hell's kitchen.

WOW, I like this place.  Really Posh yet comfortable atmosphere.  The food is wonderful and inventive, the beer selection is a who's who of micro brew and the patio is a great place to spend an afternooon day drinking!  It tends to get a little over crowded on the weekend nights so I usually stick to Sat. & Sun. afternoons.  Again a great place to chill with friends, drink great beer and enjoy the weather.  Happy hour here is always popular and the grilled wings cant beat!

What can I say? This is a great local pizza place with good service, great slices & local beer on tap! The place looks like a true NYC pizza joint & the pizza is even better! Try the Sausage rolls & Santan Brewing Co. Devils Ale. The Meatball hoagie is pretty good as well and your food comes out in no time flat! I highly recommend this great little local pizza place. A Hidden Gem!

This is the first review of a restaurant in our new HOOD! Just moved to Chandler from the old QC! Man it's great to be back in civilization! The hubby is working tonight so - what the heck time to keep the pans in the boxes we moved them in and off to Pei Wei! I ordered the Dan Dan noodles, it was very tasty! I ordered the Kung Pao for the hubby - all I can say is that my mouth is watering as I sit here and look at it. He's worked hard all day - wouldn't be right to nick a bite.! Ha! I walked in and went straight to the take out desk - which I appreciate. They took my order promptly and in 10 min my order was done! That's pretty darn fast!   I've eaten here a couple of times and well it's good! I agree with Lynn, the food is always consistent - who can complain with that!   Check it out!

We have to give them top ratings for making SanTan brewing company's specialized beer glasses. Their beer only tastes better in these glasses!! A great local family owned business in downtown Chandler! Every type of glass under the sun can be found in the store, they all have an amazing design! If you are looking for unique glasses, please check out Di Sciacca. A little gem in down town Chandler.

Okay, went one night about 9pm to grab a margarita! It was terrible, they have some sort of premix that they poured out of an iced tea container. On the rocks... Just unappetizing and sickly sweet. While on the other hand the chicken tacos are always good and Sunday breakfast is good.  Let's not forget the always present distorted symphony of I'll behaved howling children.  God I fear for the future!Ahhh Memories!  Summary : good food, bad margaritas, bring your ear plugs!

What would we do without Home Depot? I've heard there are some stores that are open 24 hours! HOLY CRAP!   We just recently used their cabinet design service. Richard was very knowledgeable and guided us every step of the way. Home Depot doesn't use HD people for installation they use a third party contractor, but if something goes pear shaped, HD is responsible for fixing the issue. I did find that the installation cost was a bit high - double the amount we were paying for the cabinets? WHAT? We decided to find our own contractor and it saved us a bunch, but I guess it just depends on the project and your budget.   The employees are always very friendly and helpful. We purchased the interior paint for our home, one of the cans exploded in the trunk of my MINI - A toasted wheat painted MINI - it was an ugly scene. They replaced the can of paint and helped out with paper towels and spray to help remove the paint. OH The JOYS of remodeling!   Overall great store, nice employees and endless possibilities!

You gotta say, any bank that pays you to make deposits, use your debit card and has great on-line banking to boot deserves 5 stars. If I had 1 complaint, it would be weekend hours. I wish they were open later on Saturdays, but for a bank that put an extra $20 back into my account this month just for using it's services, I cant complain to much! When did Wells Fargo or BofA ever do that for you? I am Finally Home!

Fun Traditional Pub! We use to live very close to Fibber's, but now I join Mark T. and that in moving to Queen Creek, we don't frequent Fibbers as often..And we miss it!   It's a great place to meet after work or just to have a bite during the week. What's wrong with midweek boozing?  Last time I had the curry boxty, very yummy! Loads of cauliflower, I would have preferred more curry, but still good!   Great fillet Mignon sliders! Ask for extra blue cheese crumbles and horsey sauce! We love bartender Clayton! He rocks! Great live music like Mike Mercier and the Insomniacs!!

This may be the coolest market place Arizona has ever seen. This Whole Foods is truly a market. Inside this store is contained an organic grocer, a deli, BBQ food restaurant, wine & beer bar, cheese shoppe, Asian/sushi bar &, WAIT FOR IT........The best/largest Craft BEER selection I have ever seen outside of Tops Liquor Store. Why not 5 Stars? It's a bit pricey!!! Worth it beyond a doubt when I can afford it!

Seriously guys, if you haven't been to Wholefoods you have to hit this place up! They recently updated their BAR area - yes I said BAR area in a grocery store!! What? I know it's crazy but they have over 29 beers just on tap and the biggest beer wall I've ever seen - they say the wall has over 600 different types of beers....... Wowie Zowie! The coolest part was they let me take a beer from the wall and enjoy it with the wonderful pizza! Which by the way is 10.00 on SUNDAY  ---- DEAL DEAL DEAL! Check out the picture someone posted - these pizza's rock!

OK, if there is one thing I know, it's a really great curry. My husband grew up in England and is curry MAD so I have had my share. Let me say that Thai Basil may be the best East Asian curry house in the entire Valley. I love seeing a great local business produce such amazing food. There are many different curries on the menu including red, green, yellow and and coconut spiced dishes to name a few. For those of you fearing this sort of spice, FEAR NOT, this place does it with style & will not disappoint even the newest or most inexperienced palette. There are 5 different spice levels, 4 different meats & even noodles and rice for the Plain Jane(Coors Light Drinker/ Toyota Camry Driver) person we all know but pretend not to. Bottom Line, are you a Curryaholic? Do you just love a great meal? Thai Basil should be at the top of your list. 5 STARS!

Visited Thai Basil again yesterday while on my way back to the DREADED DMV. The DMV Sucked as usual, but Thai Basil was wonderful as always! I had the Red Curry Chicken & had it Thai Hot. Let me say it was the perfect amount of heat. The sauce is Sweet & hot & DELICIOUS! My husband had the Yellow Curry Chicken and was just as impressed. The food comes out in no time & the atmosphere is very ZEN if you get my drift. The music is tranquil & you can always hear birds gently tweeting in the back ground. A great break away when you have to face the dreaded DMV or on break from a hectic day at work. GOOD STUFF!!!

Went back to McDuffies tonight to watch the NFL draft.  Had a blast drinking the craft beer of the month, watching the draft & BONUS! they have just added OTB!!! Come on horse #5!!! Momma needs a new purse!.  Ok so I only bet on a few horses, but it was fun!!!  Great prices, televisions everywhere, fairly good food and a comfortable atmosphere.  Worth a shot when your in the neighborhood.

Dust off your chaps, clean the poop off your boots, brush that ten gallon hat and head on down to another unique Queen Creek Eatery. What a great atmosphere! Indoors & outdoors, mabey the coolest patio I've ever seen!  A few good craft beers on tap, steaks/BBQ to die for and a great time watching old cowboys/girls doing terribly funny dances. Truly  worth the trip and a great night out! Get there before happy hour ends and the prices are reasonable as well.

Service continues to get worse.. What is it with this place, I am really really trying to like them! They are a great local place I want to keep frequenting, but if I have to continually remind them what's in their antipasto platter.. I should work there!!!  The food is great - I had to take a way a star for service. They seem to be overwhelmed or they just hire staff that are anti social and hate dealing with people.. I feel bad, but it has to be noted.

Went here on Valintines day for a romantic evening out.  Robert the owner was very inviting and the wine he picked for us, a medium bodied Pino Noir was wonderful.  Our meal was the four course valetines day special.  Portions were tiny but absolutely delisious.  I noticed two local beers on tap as well, always a plus for me!   The atmosphere is very interesting as many parts of the decore are made of pressed cork, a nice touch in a wine bar.  Our seating was the only disapointing part of the evening, as we were placed right next to the servers station.  A little uncomfortable on a romantic date night like Valentines day.  All in all, 4 stars.

What a neat little place! Imagine a deli style wine bar that does pretty much everything right. As I understand, this is a family affair an it shows. Everything is done with care an attention to detail. The wine selection is nice, reasonably priced and even a little adventurous. Every bit of nosh I have had here has been well prepared and tasty. The only complaint I have is the lighting. Not much ambiance when the place super duper bright at 9pm. Having said this, I'm told they are expanding into the vacant space next door and that it will carry a more traditional ambient wine/dining experience. Has anyone got a Candle? I CANT WAIT!

Right! Went to paradise Bakery this morning while dropping our dog of at the vet's office.  I brought home the Spinach quiche, quiche muffin and the Beligian waffel w/ strawberries to share with my husband.   I must say, the quiche was DELISIOUS!!!  The waffel was just ok because they left off the whipped cream.  That's the best part!  Anyhoo, try the quiche, it's wonderful. For that, they earn another Star!

Everytime I go to Majerle's I leave wondering why I ever went in the 1st place.  The service is BAD most of the time, the bartenders have attitudes & the beer selection is sub par.  I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because for some reason I wind up going  back, usually to meet friends.  Im never impressed by any part of their service, menu or price structure.   How can up consistently mess up sliders? Yes EVERY TIME. I ran into Thunder Dan once, thats got to be worth somthing right?

Pita Jungle ROCKS! Although this is our second favorite Mediterranean restaurant! Always has great hummus, lebni, teziki and fantastic salads! Super fast service at lunch, so if your are looking for a place to eat try Pita Jungle out! Try the chicken lavash swarma wrap!! Delish!

Great Chicken Pasta with lemon dressing this time around.  Berry tea so good it almost makes you forget there is not any good beer available. Atmosphere is always comfortble, food is consistently good, service is mostly just ok.  I'm a regular here and plan on keeping it that way!  GOOD STUFF!

So, I am going to have to agree with Glenn. This place was mediocre at best. I ordered the breakfast bowl which had scrambled eggs, sausage and should have come with a potato cake on top. When my order came, I was totally caught off guard it looked like something I made at home served in a bowl from the thrift shop .. Gross! The potato cake was no where to be found, about 10 min later my potato cake showed up .. I am all about supporting the local businesses but they need some definate improvements!!

Update: On our last visit  we met a bartender called Derek.   Service was much better than the first couple go rounds and everything truly came out on time.  He mixes one hell of a great Lobsterita!  What a difference one good person can make eh?

A great local date night spot on the water, at the Lakes in Tempe. This bar is mainly patio style, some area's are covered by sails while others are open air.   Great beer on tap including Kronenborg 1664! My second favorite beer! Food is okay, try the pecan and brie quesadilla and the daily soup! Service is normally quite good and they also feature great local musicians on the weekends, like Walt Richardson.  If you live on the lake, you can even dock your boat here! How cool is that?  There are new tables right down on the waters edge for that romantic date!  Give this place a try, you'll love it!

What's not to like? Let's start with the food. Was that really hummus? I think it may have been Elmer's glue! What's next you say? The bartender that crawls around on the beer coolers like a lonely stripper at an airport titty bar? Is there more? But of course! A poor beer selection, 35 min. wait for hummus aka glue and a, let's be fair to them, really stinky bathroom! On the up side if you happen to get trashed they will arrange a free ride home. The bartender may even go with you for a few dollars more!  That's worth a star, maybe 2.

I came here looking for a truly unique dining experience. This place boasts a menu of exotic meats/game not available in many other places. The ambiance while unique is a bit like a mausoleum. Stuffed Big Game everywhere you look. Not just on the walls, everywhere! A little creepy when you think about it.  Next, the food wasn't prepared with much care. The Elk burger was a frozen patty, not fresh and the "Pork Wings" were the very same ones I had at Nicantinos pizza a few days previous. The bartender knew nothing about the beer selection and the plethora of howling children made for and uncomfortable and aggravating experience. The manager was a little strange as well, not very comfortable in his own skin. In hindsight I guess you might say he fit in rather well in this place. A strange experience at best.

NO! now I hear they are doing Scarerioke, I mean Karaoke? "Let me tell u a little story bout a man named jed..." Boy, you got a real Pertty(Yes Pertty) Mouth!  Ok, that may be a bit harsh, but I have to disagree with Matt S., this is not quality food. As I said, my burger was from the freezer! For a Truly Great Steak try Brio or The Keg. Both of these places are located at SanTan Village and are quite close if you are already making the trip to Power and Germann Rd. for Trophies. I must say this as well: Brio, like Trohpy's, may ask you to pay top dollar for a steak BUT will NEVER subject you to Karaoke! That's Just Silly. Concentrate on whats important. Food, Service and Product Knowledge. On my visit, to Trophy's, all of these areas needed work.

We don't know what all the bad fuss is about, this a comfortable local sports bar with a huge beer selection, dirt cheap prices and loads, I mean loads of TVs! Food is sports bar fair but the beer and service is pretty good! Bathrooms are clean, which is unusual for a sports bar.  Hey for 2.99 lunch give them a try!

Great place for cigars and believe it or not, great local beer! Santan Brewing company, my favorite beer is on tap at Stogie Cutters! The staff is amazing ready to answer any question you have. I am new to cigars and they were very helpful with recommendations. The atmosphere is fun and very welcoming. A definite must try!

I have to say how pleasantly suprised I am everytime I walk walk in and see the craft beer selection at this place.  Its wonderful. My husband says Jim the owner personaly selects each of the beers on tap.  I have to say that he has great taste!  The local breweries are great places to go, but this place has beer from all of them! HEAVEN.

Hello All - I went to Lavie Nails about  4 weeks ago - I wanted to wait and see how my Schellac nails held up and I have great news to share! Still looking great after 4 weeks! Now, I know I am pushing it, but I expected to be going back to the shop sooner, but YAY! That's awesome!  The shop owner is very nice an accomodating - I went in on a Friday for the first time and it was empty - they ask the majority of their returning clients to make an appointment, which I don't mind. Lavie also offers a rewards program - I believe it costs 5 dollars for the card, but has a 10 dollar credit on it - so your next appointment will be 10.00 off! That is only the first time - as you come in for services you begin to accumulate points based on the total of your services - from what I understand you get 10% - so if I spend fifty bucks I get 5 dollars off my next visit! I don't know - but this is better than any coupon.!  I have my second appointment today - and I will make sure to update the reward card section!    All I can say is that I loved it so much that I am going back - anything with a reward card works for me!!!!!

It's a Wal-Mart that does not sell frozen drink mixers! Can you believe this travesty! I had to go to Target! I like Target anyway, but I thought since it's so close to home lets save some time. Nope, I had to hop right back into my car and head over the GOOD store that has frozen drink mix for my Lobsterita night! The staff had no idea what I was talking about, I was thinking perhaps they were missing a chromosome? No not really, just made me feel like a huge boozer but I like lobsteritas, okay? Well everyone knows wal-mart - its good in a pinch, but not for booze.

No matter where you shop, buying tires is always and expensive trip and a Plane Pain in the ARSE. So why 5 Stars for Discount Tire? Why I would love to tell you!  5 Stars because in my experience,  if you are not a complete Cheap Ass and  spend a little extra coin on their roadside warranty, they will ALWAYS replace or fix your tire No Questions Asked.  They have replaced tires for me without question on damn near evey car I have owned up until now.  Perhaps I have bad luck with tires but Discount has never let me down & thats about as good as it gets my friend!  Oh yea I almost forgot, prices are reasonable as well, BRAVO!

I don't think I could feel complete without a pet in our family.!!! We have two pups and a cat, so I frequent PetSmart quite often. They have the best selection of dog treats, we like to use the dental sticks which helps control tartar and helps with stinky breath! They work! Plus the boys really love them. As for Klaus our cat she loves the grass they sell there. Service is always friendly and the return policy rocks! I purchased two Kong balls and the boys fought over them constantly, I had to return them - they were great! No problem, I received store credit, but I didn't mind. This PetSmart also has a Banfield Pet Hospital, Pet Hotel , Grooming and Doggie Day Care. It's a nice to have sooooo many options  close to home.

The Queen Creek Post Office:   OK, what can you say about a government office that seems to open and close on their own time? No hours of operation listed in this post office & Saturday hours that seem to change to meet the employees whims. Wait a Tick? Don't we pay their salaries? Wankers!

Met one of the owners of Dave's Electric at Whole Foods in Tempe last week.  what a nice lady!  Beyond that, Electric Dave has been around forever an comes from my home town, Bisbee AZ..  I have sampled Dave's beers for years at all the different beer festivals and have always enjoyed them.  You can alwys tell Dave's beer by the Lightning Bolt tap handles.  They are really cool.   Any hoo, what a great idea to open a brewpub in downtown tempe.  The timing is perfect with everybody gaining a respect for good Arizona beer.  Good Luck Dave!!!

OK, this is a beer and wine bar/tasting room connected to Tops Liquor Store in Tempe AZ. Let me begin by saying that their beer selection is second to none, after all, they are connected to what might be the coolest indie liquor store in the entire state. The beers constantly rotate and there is always something new to try. There is a bit of nosh, including a cheese plate that paired well with the local beer I was drinking and a great mix of people. This is by no means a restaurant, it's more like a gathering place for those who truly enjoy quality beer and the kind of atmosphere that seems to follow. This could easily be 5 Stars, but the service can occasionally leave you cold. This is a MUST try for beer lovers looking for the unexpected. Cheers!

This is a remodeled Famous Sam's , I was just there last night and they are finishing up the woman's bathroom with new tile floor and paint. It looked really nice!  Now on to the good stuff! On Thursday nights JJ Madisons has a great dinner deal! BOGO (Buy on get one) Free Burger nights! They have awesome burgers and great if you are on a budget!  They offer great local beer, again Santan Brewing company Devil's Ale is on Tap! Yummy!! This  is a sports bar, they have many TV's and pool tables, but they also offer wine tastings and beer tastings, so it's not your typical sports bar! G the manager is wonderful and we always have great service. If you are in the Mesa area JJ's is worth a try!

A friend & I visited this quaint little Awatukee sports bar today for lunch & boy was I surprised! This is not your average sports bar menu.  Let me begin by saying Brad, the owner is apparently a popular guy in these parts & is known quite well to all the locals. I got a bit lost on my way over and was given directions by three people all willing to help once they found out where I was heading. COOL!  OK, back to the menu. I had the Bratwurst Burger, yes I said Burger! This thing was Fantastic! And Actual Patty burger made from ground Bratwurst & Bacon! There I have said it, BACON ground inside the burger. HEAVEN. Although the beer selection left something to be desired, I noticed that they were cooking with allot of beer. Score One For Brads Place! A little beer creativity in the kitchen is always a welcome sight.  Sports: Televisions O Plenty & this is definitely a Viking's Bar. Lots of purple stuff on the walls. As I understand, they have every sports package available and there aren't any bad seats(so to speak).  The ambiance could be a bit more stylish, but for a local neighborhood they have it down fairly well. Good Local Bar, glad I tried it!

Where do we start! We LOVE this place! An Australian wine bar that recently relocated from Chandler Fashion Square Mall to the new Lakes area at McQueen and Warner. Its hard to believe they've created such a wonderful atmosphere in an old Baja Fresh Location! Amazing! Phil, Rodger, Josh and staff have worked very hard transforming this new location and it has kept it's quaint, casual and comfortable atmosphere. Wine selection is reasonable priced, compared to Pesto's in Chandler. New steak on menu is FANTASTIC, try with blue cheese crumbles! Yet another place that carries my favorite local beer from SanTan Brewery! If you love wine and enjoy exotic foods this is a place to try!

Nice reasonably priced wine selection, generous pours ( which we all love)! We ordered the bruchetta, it was amazing! When ordering you have the option of selecting the bruchetta - I recommend the fig!! Yummy! It's warm and cozy, I don't know what Molly is talking about the music complimented the atmosphere! Nice place in the neigborhood, the staff is amazing! Glad they are here it's my new favorite place!

Pigs & Pinot, a great night out at the Living Room wine bar.  This was Living Room's grand opening celebration and was a big event to say the least.  Wine vendors everywhere giving samples, live music and Every COUGAR in The Chandler/Ocotillo Arizona area Out On The Hunt!  We had a blast drinking and watching!!!  GRRRR!!!!!!!

Right on, I've been on a roll lately.  All of my recent updates have been great experiences.  LIFE IS GOOD. This one is no exception.  Had lunch here at McCools today & it was Great!  I had a lemon pasta w/ chicken in a Cajun seasoned sauce & a great local American Pale Ale.  This is why eating & drinking LOCAL is so important.  Spend your money, invest in your community & enjoy every bite! I always do!

I recently took our Spanish Water dog Eddie to Banfield. On Tuesday's they have wellness hours between 2p and 3:30pm in which they wave the office fee! Awesome! Eddie needed to have his rabies vaccination, he did so well with all the poking! Eddie is a shy boy and gets really nervous - so it was nice to see that the Vet took her time with him. The prices are reasonable. I've had several other pets and sometimes vets fees can be ridiculous, but we pay them for our little buddies. It's nice to see that just because we live sooo far away - we aren't charged crazy fees to take care of our pets. I made a follow up appointment and they were very busy, but were able to accommodate my schedule. I appreciate that!    Eddie' s appointment is tomorrow - loking forward to posting a positive update! Give them a try!

As far as record/cd stores go, this one is deep. What I mean is they have a huge selection of everything new and used. This location was previously Warehouse and it shows. The best selection of used music in town! Looking for that hard to find cd cheap? Come here first.

The 11.98 liter sale is the BOMB! They have so many shampoos and conditioners that are on sale it's amazing! I always come out with at least 3 bottles - just for my husband!   They also have the 7.98 hair spray sale, oh my! Girls do I load up on these! My favorite is Hard Head - by Bed head! AWESOME!   I have had a pedicure in the salon area, I will admit it was the best one I've ever had, but the price tag was steep! If you don't mind spending a few bucks - it's well worth it!

This is a great nail salon! I've had the manicure and pedicure and both were wonderful! I love going to Enjoi because they offer a hot stone massage with your pedicure... hold on that's great right? but it does get better....... IT'S FREE! No additional fee for the hot stone!! Awesome! All the people at Enjoi are nice and friendly and they do a fantastic job for a very reasonable price.

4 Stars because the Pasta Bowls truly ROCK!  This is not your dads Dominos Pizza, they have really changed.  The Sandwiches are good, the pasta bowls are killer and the pizza is MUCH better.  Service is pretty good as well.  The online ordering process is pretty cool.  It updates the status of your order from prep to baking to checking to delivery.  For delivery food you really cant beat it & I never thought I would say that about Dominos.  Good Job.

To start they have 4 beers on tap - two from local company SanTan Brewing and two Belgian style - including Trippel Carmelite. The bone in Fillet Mignon was so tender, I didn't even need a knife to cut it. This was served along with bone marrow, which was strange but delicious! Comfortable atmosphere and friendly, yet inexperienced servers. Growing pains I suppose. This place a has a great future and is a total step away from the previous 98 south concept. It's nice to see new restaurants in downtown Chandler!

4 stars because this place is great for fast food.   It's a little hidden but worth finding.  The lime infused rice is wonderful, the burritos are HUGE and all the meats are always fresh and well prepared.  It's great that you can get in and out of a place so quickly with such wonderful food.  This beats Jack in the Box or most other fast food places by a LANDSLIDE!

Yet another fine meal from Chipotle, I am now convinced that this cannot be called Fast Food. It's just Far To Good to be categorized with Mac Donalds or Taco Bell The grilled chicken burrito is always great and is HUGE!  It's always two meals worth of food.  Service is always quick so we are always in & out Lickety Split! What more can you ask?

Thought I would give them a call after Mark T's glowing review! I needed service done on a rental property in the Queen Creek area and thought, since they are local to give them a call.  I spoke to Tanya and she was pleasant and said they would send someone right over to have a quote done on the property. I did let her know that my house is on what they call a Z lot - so a super small front yard and small back yard almost townhomeish - but it's a single family home for people who don't want to deal with a yard! BINGO - that's for me! Anyway I've had landscapers out before I pay maybe 50 dollars, and that's because it's their minimum - I had a great landscaper that retired who only charged me 35 because it's so tiny and I MISS HIM SO MUCH!   Well all in all - they called back with a quote - $100 for the front yard $75 for the back!! WTFrick??? Did you look at my house? There is practically NO YARD! Sorry - it just seemed as if they were taking advantage of me - I don't have millions of dollars to spend on landscaping and I want a service I can trust.  But if you have 175  to spend on a yard feel free to contact them!

Just moved from Queen Creek to Chandler!!!!   While my husband and I lived in our home in QC for around 1 year together - the amount of crap that came out of that house was amazing! I spoke to Ryan about a week before our move - he was very professional and returned my call promptly. If you've read any of my reviews I appreciate promptness!!!! We set up an initial move date and we were set - or I thought.... (sigh) The contractor at our new home was of course, running behind and wouldn't be done until the day of our move. I spoke to Ryan and he was so helpful in rescheduling our move. That was awesome, especially on short notice. Ugh!   Well I guess onto the move.... lol Ryan and his partner were fantastic! They wrapped all of my important items and took care of all our furniture! Not one thing broke in the heap of items we moved! BONUS!   We had a total of a 10 hour move - the rate seemed reasonable. These guys are honest, hardworking and best of all aren't CREEPY like some movers. Both these lads are prior military and in my opinion just hard working guys.   If you are looking for a mover, don't hesitate to contact Ryan with Move and Save - you won't be sorry!

Stopped in the first time a few months back to see The Insomniacs perform.  Service was less than desirable but the place was busy so I let it pass.  The 14oz. beers they call "Pints" were also a little disheartening when I got the bill & discovered how much I was paying for them.   Decided to give it another try last week & was even more disapointed than on the 1st visit.  We sat down at a table and ordered drinks with the lunch special cottage pie.  The place was almost empty and the service was still terrible!  Never saw our server again! We decided to move to the bar for better service, which was much better.  Despite better service at the bar, our food took 45min. to arrive, and arrived cold.   I asked to speak to a manager the bartender identified as Sean.  As you might guess he never came by.  He did however walk by a few times giving us strange looks?  The bartender said he was also cooking/busy & that he wasn't very good at it.  OK!  The place gets 2 Stars for the nice ambiance and a good beer selection, even if the glasses are only 14oz.   They obviously put ALOT of money into building the place. How about the food, service & a REAL pint of beer?  We live fairly close to Shakespears & might come more often if they got on their game.
