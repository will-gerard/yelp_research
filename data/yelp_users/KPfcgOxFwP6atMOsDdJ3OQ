Take 15 pounds of typical Asian fast food entrees, dump them in a laundry machine with sugar instead of detergent, and serve on a fresh lump of sticky steamed rice. Don't get me wrong, its still decent. But that's the caliber of what you should expect here.  This place has got the cheer of a rest stop restroom. The guy I seem to always order form always looks like a manic depressive. But hey, if you want calories and it's on the way, go for it.

A lot of food from breakfast places tend to taste of fatigue and depressed cooks, but not here. Food tastes fresh, nice portions, and great variety on omelettes and sandwiches. Waffles and pancakes taste fresh and fluffy, and helps with the depression of being in Downtown Phoenix. The staff is always great--feels like a folksy 1950's movie because they're mostly moms who ply on the coffee and food and tell you to eat your veggies.

If you can, go over to Rural and eat at the other location. The pricing, given the small portioning, is like a dry booger on the roof of my nostril--irritating and unreasonable. The staff have the friendliness of a video game NPC. It's like talking to soulless shells.

I've come here since I was a child, but mostly because it's right next to the mosque and out of habit. Food is generally good but sometimes lacking in freshness. Service can be very trying, with a higher-than-expected pricing on top.

AZ boba tea places just don't match up to more Asian-saturated regions, like the Bay Area. But this place is decent. Lots of good flavors, fast service, and recently added on pudding for extra ingredients.

They must have run out of every spice except for salt and just added extra to compensate. I love salt but even this was too much. Also, diarrhea. I've since stopped eating here. Given the choice, I prefer the runs to be caused by Filiberto's rather than Poliberto's.

There are BBQ-purists whose ideal BBQ menu consists of one item: steak, preferably raw. Me, I wish these joints would branch out a bit, and that's what Lucille's does well. Besides the usual steak, smoked chicken, and burgers, they've got curly onion straws, a fantastic southern seafood section, fried chicken, jambalaya, and a great brisket sandwich. The iced tea and strawberry limeade are pretty great, too.  Setting is nice, and I do like the service. Friendly people, even on crowded peak times. One time, I was asking a server his opinion between two items on the menu. He leaned in to explain that, while management doesn't allow him to bash on anything, he really wouldn't recommend the (i forgot) here. That's the kind of genuine catering to customers that I love, and the kind of behavior that would get him fired.

Nice setting, good food, and good service. A nice place if you're looking for fairly uninteresting but tasty brunch-y food in the company of friends. In particular, they make a consistently good smoked chicken that is both flavorful and succulent.

Jerk chicken, plantains, whatever- it's a great selection of Caribbean food, which is a flavor we don't get much of around here.   But man, I've been to cemeteries with more cheer than this place. I almost expect to see passed out drunk bums inside.

Good food, terrible service. Maybe nice for a bar dinner for two, but definitely not kid-friendly.  We went today to catch a celebratory brunch for a few family achievements. My wife and I tow along a toddler and an infant, and we wanted to get a table for 6, for the other family coming in. The hostess looked at us like we were blood-stained hobos or something, and seemed oh-so-upset that she had to take us to our table. When we asked if there were high chairs or accommodations for the infant in the car seat, she flatly replied no and suggested we could put our infant on the floor. You know, totally normal restaurant practice.  The staff, from bus boy to waiters, seemed to do just the bare minimum. No smiles or friendly talk, and it was almost like they didn't want to make eye contact. I'm Asian so with my squinty eyes I can understand if people have a hard time making eye contact. But my in-laws have perfectly normal eyes. One waitress, who was also attending at the bar, was nice enough to talk to us a bit, but was too busy and eventually had to ask another grumpy person to take care of us.   Anytime we had questions, like whether we could sit outside, or where the restroom is, or, oh I don't know, if we could I have a water refill, we'd be met with what looked like eye-rolling. We all felt uncomfortable. I actually felt relieved to leave, eventually.   Food was nice, but not good enough to warrant coming back for.

My wife and I ate here when they'd just opened, and we're fans to this day. The buffet, open both lunch and dinner, is at a cool $10/adult, and is the best bang for your buck of any Indian restaurant I've eaten at. Food's fresh, and dinner comes with fresh unlimited naan and a sizzling tandoori chicken and kabab.   I don't think any sane human being ever goes to an Indian restaurant for its service. But the staff is great. The management know us and if they're in, come out to say hi, and the waiting staff are nice and frequently checks in.   If you're vegetarian, half the buffet is just for you. I don't go to Indian restaurants for veggies but I make an exception for this place. A big fan of the paneer and pakora.

I have eaten here many times, dining in and taking out. I come back for the food, but the service is driving me away. There has not been one time where they did not mess up the order, and the wait has always been trying.

I know a lot of people who say that Oregano's has sub-par pizza. It's pizza. It's not supposed to be a party in your mouth. It's just pizza. And at Oregano's, it's good. They've got some okay pasta and some nice sandwiches, but if anything, you want to hit this place up for the Pizza Cookie dessert, which IS a party in your mouth: half-baked cookie dough with a dollop of ice cream on top in a pizza deep dish. It's fantastic.   I'm also partial to some of their salads. Great theme and ambiance, and the college-aged staff makes an effort not to seem too much like college-aged staff.   However, it's crowded and loud, which is a nice environment if you're just hanging with friends or on a date with the wife. Bringing kids is a bit of a nightmare because of the long wait times and the claustrophobic rage it puts my kids into. They do give the kids a coloring thing and a lob of pizza dough to play with. Great touches, but just touches. It's like trying to put out a forest fire with a truckload of water. It'll help for all of a minute, and in the end you still have to clean up the truck wreckage.

There are frat dorm rooms that have more space and charm than this joint. But it still gets five stars because there's no Thai food in AZ that tastes this good.   This is what I want out of Thai food: delicious, and lots of it. And that is what Chanpen does.   Also, Chanpen sounds like an Asian trying to say "Champion". I am Asian so that qualifies me to make racially offensive statements.

Service is awful, even for Chinese people (I'm Chinese, so I am socially qualified to make that statement.) Food is good occasionally, but I question their hygienic standards.  For example, I know that Peking duck is not supposed to taste rancid. It tasted rancid twice in my frequent visits, and I eat there mostly because my in-laws like the place.   "The duck tastes off." I said.  "No it doesn't." said the waitress without missing a beat.  Once, while dining with my toddler son, my wife asked if they had anything for him to drink along with his water. We asked for milk or orange juice, both of which they had none. "What do you give kids, then?" asked my wife. "Just give him soda." said the waitress. My father-in-law decided to have the Special of the Day.   "We don't have the Special of the Day." said the waitress, her deadpan face never betraying the dripping irony of the statement. The manager came out soon thereafter.   "Sorry, we don't have the special of the day today, sir. Can I get you the wonderful fresh cod that we're known for? It's steamed with traditional spices for half an hour and served on a bed of greens-- a delight to the taste, especially with a splash of light Pinot Noir."  ... is what he never said. Instead, the cap-and-jeans dude looked irritated and said, "Get number 44. We don't have special. Get 44."  "What's 44?"   "It's good." And he walked away.

I never give five stars. I do now, because Laveen desperately needs food that isn't poison. They could've served me fried rat (FDA approved) and I'd have still recommended it.   FOOD: They haven't done their grand opening yet, but if the soft opening is any indication, it's a keeper. It's not "shoot-me-in-the-face-because-I-will-never-experience-something-this-good-again" good, but it's probably in the "punch-me-in-the-face" range. I recommend the chicken/paneer tiki masala for those new to Desi food.   SERVICE: They apologized for the order taking a while to make and also made eye contact. If you eat at Desi joints often, then you know this is 10/10.  PRICE: $9.99 a platter comes with a decent-sized box with a big side of rice. A bit steep, I think, but I'm cheap. Also, it's really only expensive compared to fast food, and I would not classify this as fast food.
