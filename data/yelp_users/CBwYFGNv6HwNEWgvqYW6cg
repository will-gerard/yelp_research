The service was the worst. It took us 10 minutes to get seated and it wasn't even rush hour. We then were seated and it took our waitress 15 minutes to get our drinks & give us a menu. As we ordered the food we were forgot about and our food didn't come for 35 more minutes. Yes, that's an hour without food. Then we stopped the manager and he took care of us. As our sour waitress came back to give us our refills she put salt on the rims of our strawberry lemonade instead of sugar. This was the last straw. We then ate all the food and spoke with the manager about the terrible service.  The only reason this has a star is because the food was good.

Since zookz moved to Camelback and Central they've really surprised my taste buds! One morning a friend and I decided to grab breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by the amazing customer service provided by the associates and the owner! She was welcoming, warm and excited to see us back again! So excited to try more toasted sandwiches! Cheers!

Customer service is subpar to the quality of the food here . I've ordered the lettuce wraps twice  for take out and twice they've forgotten my lettuce. If the food wasn't so good I wouldn't be so concerned but its delicious . After calling the manager about the second forgotten lettuce incident I then got a personal phone call from Flo . She was extremely personable and understanding and helped me out a lot . It really shows how much you care about your customers.
