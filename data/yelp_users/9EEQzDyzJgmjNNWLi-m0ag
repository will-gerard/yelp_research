This place Is so cute!! The groomer made my adorable schnauser even cuter than before!  I didn't think that was possible.  They are nice people and the place is clean and we'll kept.

This studio was awesome.  This was the first time I've ever ridden in the dark.  Cycling doesn't seem intense, but it is!  The music was really good and I had a lot of fun. The only thing I like better at corebalance was that you can wear your own tennis shoes and don't need to pay for special shoes.

My whole family started seeing the doctors here.  I really like my doctors and I've seen Dr. Clark & Dr. Corkrin. My grandparents started coming here and we all like this place.  All of the doctors I've had are really awesome.  So glad I switched doctors.

just adopted a little guy and took him here.  The doctor and staff were so nice.  You get a free exam if he is a rescue!  Definitely bringing snowball back

I love green.  I had the "chicken" made from tofu and it was really good.  I think I actually liked it better than regular chicken.  Green is awesome!

As far as car salesman, this place was awesome.  John dearmond was my salesman and he knew his stuff.    What I am complaining about is the service.  I went in trusting that Toyota since they have a "Toyota care" package...that they would care about giving me the best prices... being a girl I don't know anything about cars.. just like at danny's car wash they charged me up the wazoo.  I went in for an oil change and clips because the bottom of my car got screwed from my apartment complex.  Don't go anywhere unless you know people and are friendly with them that treat you right and will tell you exactly what you need.  $200 later for $20 clips for my car.. and I hate Camelback Toyota now, and will never take my car back to get serviced by them, no matter what it is.

This was my first time & I had Katie.  She did a really cute cut.  I love this salon, & I used a groupon so it was only like twenty something bucks! :) definitely recommend.  I also went to the Indian School location. Beautiful salon!

Awesome acupuncturist. I've been to Chiropractors, osteopathic dr, and Other acupuncturists, but he is the absolute BEST.  He can always get rid of my back pain & only takes 1 session. Offers a great price and he & his wife are always kind and caring.

This is a great place to start out at.  I am a beginner and had never done hot yoga before.  You can sign up for a free week for yoga month(September)  I love the studio, the set up it great.  Great deals for students and non-students! :) thumbs up! Even have student rates.

Bought a groupon 4 the monthly unlimited. It kicked my butt! But if you're looking for a strictly boxing gym, this ain't the place.  They do circuits, but I haven't taken the boxing class yet, so we"ll see.

You would think they would double check where they send packages before they send them out.  I had sent a watch in to be repaired, but they had lost it.  Then they called me back and said that they had found it and that it was on its way to the factory.  So I call the factory and then they tell me that they were fixing it.  Months later I call back that watch company and they have no record of it.  I have no idea what happened, but they lost it.  and I am out $110 watch.  Never again will I come back.

I thought this place was a pretty good gym.  Or maybe I am just really out of shape because I certainly got a good run for my free class!  First class is free and it was fun though.  The guy was a intense, but not too intimidating especially since I haven't gone boxing for like 2 years haha!  Definitely coming back!  They have student rates during the school year, which I don't understand why it's not for the whole year, but whatever, still a good deal.

Loved it! This place is great! Pretty intense workout for my first class. 1st class is a free trial, so try it out! Don't be intimidated either, there's all levels! its $564 for 6 months which is totally a good deal and if you buy the first time you try it, you get an even better deal.

Don't go here.  You are better off going to the Verizon store. I bought a charger from here that didn't even work.  I exchanged it 2x & it was still not charging my phone
