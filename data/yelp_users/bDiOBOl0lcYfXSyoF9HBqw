First and last time ever going to this place. The service was horrible the girl taking our order wasn't very nice or helpful at all, she asked me my name for my order I said Heather she said thanks Kevin... ummm do i look like a Kevin? No.  The fries were extremely soggy and the burgers were just okay nothing special.
