The wait time is ridiculous! Took forever to be seated, and even longer till we even ordered a drink. The waiter (probably the owner) went to take an order to a table that had arrived 15 minutes after us. This is my first time here and honestly by the time our food arrived I knew this would be my last.

I love their shrimp quesadilla that has onions and cilantro! Also their breakfast burritos are the best!
