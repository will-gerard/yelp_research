Well, I would call this a 5 star restaurant, but I can only give it 4 stars, read on to see why...  I came here with my lovely girlfriend, 2 customers and their wives. We made a reservation early and got a great table over looking the strip, right next to the windows.   We had drinks (average 10$/drink) and started with the Sea Tower appetizer, which had muscles, shrimps, lobster tail and crab legs (56$).  My customers had surf and turf (46$), fish of the day (42$), lobster bisque (8$), filet mignon (42$) and NY Strip (45$). I had jumbo fried shrimp (36$) and my girlfriend had the blacked salmon (36$). A few house salads also (8$ each)... Finally, for desert, I found out it was one of my customers 24th wedding anniversary, so I had them make a special desert and write on the plate, it was very lovely (complimentary).   The reason I can only give 4 stars is service. I ordered a rum and coke before we ordered the appetizer, and didn't get it till the salads came out, about 20 minutes later. Also, it took our waiter about 10 minutes to figure out who the desert was for, even though my girlfriend not only told him, but the manager to be sure. Finally, after the meal was over,  I showed the waiter my credit card under the table and got his attention, in an effort to say "Hey, I am buying". He proceeded to take the bill over to the wrong couple, showing them the 515$ tab, NOT GOOD! The dinner was on me, from my customer, and yes maybe I am 25 and they were about 45 years old average, but you DO NOT put the bill in plain view showing the total if you don't know who it goes to. I was very insulted...  Needless to say, the tab, with tip, came to almost 600$, and that was definitively the most expensive meal I had ever paid for...  Either way, The food was all delicious (the lobster was a bit overcooked and the muscles were on the salty side), the service was generally good (minus a few mistakes), and all the flavors were delicious. I would bring customers back here, but I would make damn sure they knew who the bill was to come to.

I know rating an arbys is not a great service, but I just wanted to point out a few things...  When I arrived, the place was in tip top shape! I mean, everything was clean, in order, etc. Reasoning for this, no one was there!  When I ordered, they gave me the wrong fries and the sandwihch was a total mess (see photo attached). And for what I ordered, the price was NOT worth the level of food. The following day I went to a Wendys and spent the same amount on about double the amount of food.  I love Arby's, but not for those prices...

Welcome to the home of southern comfort, huge portions, great flavors and friendly service... Oh, did I mention how cheap it was?!?!  My fiance and I came here to grab breakfast before my meetings, and we had no idea on how it was going to go. I got the home special for 5 bucks, and my fiance got a mix and match of stuff.  Tell'ya what, they gave us a HUGE serving plate full of eggs, grits, toast and meat, and let me tell you, everything was delicious! Sadly we could not finish it all, so we took our coffees (free re-fills) and hit the bricks. Total tab, about 12 bucks!  My future head quarters is right down the street, and you can bet your sweet southern style tail feather I will be back!

One star... Easy! Here is why:  The toilet wouldn't seal after flushing, so every time I used it, I had to open the top and push down the seal by hand to get the toilet to stop.  The shower head had 4 settings, but only 1 worked, and even it was between settings so it wasn't uniform.  The heater / AC unit had no nobs and was stuck on high heat, I ended up having to unplug it because it got so hot.  The TV remote died, so I had to call the front desk and switch remotes.  My neighbors were very loud, and I ended up not falling asleep till about 1:30 a.m. because of it.  The bed side lamp was dead  The wallpaper was pealing in the shower.  The gym was garbage...   And finally, the electronic key s*** the bed to the outside door, so I had to walk the whole way around the building in the pouring rain to get back into the place one morning after a smoke.  Will never stay here again, and I would not suggest anyone staying here... P.S. - if a manager is reading this, it's room 111... Might wana look into those problems.

Came here with a group of 5 people including me...  Did a family style ordering, getting things like O.C., General Tao's, egg rolls, rice dishes, etc.  Service was fast and everything was piping hot.  No lie, the best orange chicken I have ever had!!!  Kicker, everyone ate and was full, and the cost was just over 30$! Amazing

Considering how many airlines go in and out of this place, it's rather impressive.  I flew into here last week and had no problems... Arriving / departing out of the D gates requires using the tram over so keep that in mind.  I booked my flight through US Air but it was operated by United... SO when I went to the kiosk and entered my confirmation code it would not work. I had to ask the lady for help and it went right through with her access card.  I was running behind schedule and arrived at the airport an hour before I was scheduled to leave, and I walked right into my gate and they were boarding. So mid week during the spring it takes about 35 minutes to go start to finish.  Fun slot machines if you get bored, easy access to rental cars and all airlines... Just an overall good airport.

Always love grabbing a first...  I have a lot of customers in the Vegas area, and I stopped here last Thursday just to get a quick bite between meetings. I saw the sign on the 15S for this Wendy's I am a fan... NOTE: it's about 3 miles off the highway, not right off the highway as I assumed it was.  Anyway, I knew they had a new menu, and I said what the heck, I'll give it a shot. I got the new D.T. original 1/4 lb burger combo, total was just over 6$, pretty decent deal! The sea salted fries were about the same as before, and service at this location was about average.  Clientele was very blue collar, quiet atmosphere, a nice Wendy's... Just remember, its a bit off the highway...

OK, so my girlfriend and I have tried to come here our last 3 visits to Burgh, and it was never open on Mondays (sucky). So needless to say my anticipation was rather built up before entering...  I am not an art / culture / history buff at all, but I do know SOME of his work... pretty much all the famous stuff (Campbell's Soup Can stuff, Monroe photos, etc). What I did not know is that his intention in life was ONLY to be as famous as possible with as little effort as possible.  Example 1: Most of his famous works were done using silk screening... I learned that he did the designs in a sketch (which could have been done by my 15 week old nephew), had someone else make the silk screen patterns for him, than he did the first few pieces... and let someone else make the rest after he liked them. That's B.S.  Example 2: He had his own magazine called the "Interview", and I learned the only reason he started it was just to meet and hang out with stars and famous people. He really didn't care what they had to say, he just wanted to be seen with them... A good plan, but that doesn't make you an artist...   Example 3: The TV show he did was God awful and he just wanted to be in front of the camera like the famous people he interviewed... Again to try and be more famous   Example 4: His work really isn't that inspired... And he totally sold out to main stream media, pretty much saying, HEY! LOOK! I hang out with Elvis and Marilyn Monroe and I am doing this "Great" work, call it art, shove it down your stupid throats and make you pay millions for it!  I was very unimpressed, and pissed I had to pay $20 a pop (plus parking) to see this guy make movies talking like an uneducated idiot, see tranny men deep throat bananas, walk into a room of balloons and call it "interactive" and finally, see a silk screen piece the size of the side of a barn, OF A CAMOUFLAGE PATTERN!!! And have someone say that's art...  Not worth the visit... Only reason it's 2 stars instead of 1 is b/c it was 103 degrees that day in Pittsburgh and the place had free water and A.C.

Really, really wanted to give this place a 5, but the wait was just to long. Now granted I can't fault a place for being busy, but the whole time we were there, there was always a line of about 5 people or more out the door, and they literally had a packed house with 3 people working, total, including the cook.  Now granted, the food was OUTSTANDING as we predicted. My girlfriend saw this place on the Food Network, and I grew up in and around "The Burgh", so this wasn't my first time here, but I hadn't been in about 5 years after moving to California.  We were not disappointed taste wise, as everyone knows about this place. But again, I really wanted to put a 5, but with the wait, which for us was literally 20 minutes, an extremely solid 4 is the best I can do.

Cheap(er) rooms, big, good service, clean and good location.  My girlfriend and I tend to stay further south @ like the Vdara or the PH, but those places are usually 20% more in price. Also, the gambling / drinks in those places is more expensive.   The good old volcano show every hour (photos attached) is always worth watching. Also, I won 150$ on the craps tables... So that was a plus! While gambling the drink girls are very quick and nice...  If you wana live "the Vegas High Life" I am sure you can get a really nice room here, and if you wana do a family thing or with regular friends, this place is just fine!

I really should be giving this place a 4, but due to the fact that it really kept me interested around every corner, even when I'm not really a museum fan, AT ALL, I was impressed.  Now don't get me wrong, about 10% of the art was either way over my head or I didn't have the vision (example, room with a movie of a guy wearing a white mask and had a KFC bucket on his head whilst he played bass guitar in slow motion surrounded by over sized house hold items), but a lot of it was really fun to look at!  I enjoyed myself, thoroughly!  TIP: Go to both buildings! There is a second exhibit within walking down the street. It is much smaller, but still, a lot of fun! My favorite piece with the bamboo sticks was there (see my photos).

So, I went here with my girlfriend and my friend from PA and were planning on having a really good time. I showed up with brand new white PUMAs on, and the guy wouldn't let me in. BUT, the two girls I was with,  wearing black closed toed heels and your friend was wearing open toed heels, got in... Reason they gave me? "No sneakers, we don't want you're toes getting stepped on". And I responded "But the one girl I am with wearing open toes, that's ok?" His response, "Ya bro, they are girls..."  Will never go back, to many other clubs around to try...

Technically I live in Long Beach California, but I grew up rooting for "The Buck'os" and they have always been my team. Having said that, my girlfriend and I visited the park over the 4th of July, and truly enjoyed ourselves!  The new park has an absolutely amazing view of the skyline, and the seats are actually angled towards home plate, which is very uncommon, even for the parks out here in Cali!  TIP: The cheapest beer in the ball park, by volume, calculated by my brother and me, can be found at the Gyro serving stand above third plate. I can not remember the name of the stand itself, but its the only stand that sells Gyros, so you can't miss it... If you do, ask the guys in yellow.  ANOTHER TIP: Buying beer in larger volumes is actually MORE EXPENSIVE then buying it smaller, i.e. price per ounce is cheaper to get a medium than a large, it's what we like to call a "convenience fee".  ENJOY THE GAME(S)!!!!

I don't really know what all the fuss is about for this place... It's an indoor garden... YIPPEE!  They had an extremely over-sized liberty bell with an eagle on top (looked like someone stole it off a Macy's Parade float). Live birds in cages (about 8 in total) fountains (two were positioned incorrectly and it screwed up the timing effect) and a big gaudy, non-functional ferris wheel...    We came here because my mother likes it... Not my choice... And I do not plan on coming back, even if they change the setting... Go stand outside and watch a real water show!

First off, I want to say thank you so so so much to the yelp community... After reading these reviews I rolled the dice on the free upgrade, and guess what, IT WORKED! I bought 3 of the cheapest tickets I could find and go moved from like the last row in the place, to row T, bottom floor, center! Now, there were other people who got seated up top in our area that DID NOT get upgraded, so it really is a gamble, but this is VEGAS! I calculated that these reviews saved me $140, so thanks guys!!!  Anyway, about the show, loved it (not in love with it though) that's what my girlfriend is for : ). The volume of music these guys had was unknown by me, and to be honest, I thought a lot of their songs were written by the Beach Boys... I was sorely mistaken!  LIKES: The stage was simple yet useful for the performers, backdrops were similar to each other, but different enough to get the idea that the scene changed, volume was great, COMEDY made me laugh, and the singer(s) were all very talented not only vocally, but at playing their instruments and dancing!  DISLIKES: The actors on stage had 3-4 occasions where their backs were to the audience... I learned that this is a big no-no from being in Drama shows myself in HS, but they did make it work. LANGUAGE!!!! Yes, its Jersey and that's how people talked back then, but I brought my mother who was really turned off by it... You can make your point that it was a rough neighborhood and tough people without using the F word about 50 times throughout the show. I also would have liked to have seen a little more variety in the sets to be honest... If you see shows like Phantom or Le Miserable you will know what I mean...  All-in-all, worth the $77 dollars we paid per ticket (the upgrade was great!) and I would suggest anyone go see it. Even if you don't THINK you know their music, trust me you do... Unless you live under a rock... : )

Walking into this hotel (specifically the room) was like walking into the year 2020, no kidding!  We stayed here on a Thursday night and got the basic room for $120, what they don't tell you is at check out, you get nicked for a $22 resort fee + tax... But considering the rooms are usually $180-$200, the $120 price was decent.  You walk into the room, the curtains open and the TV comes on with your name on it, the Time and indoor / outdoor temps. The entire room can be controlled by one "tablet" looking remote that includes lights, curtains, TV, radio, all volumes... Pretty much anything with an on/off switch or is plugged in can be controlled by this universal remote, AMAZING.   My favorite part, we set our "wake up call" to be the curtains opening, the lights coming on and the TV coming on... SO COOL! The bathroom was pretty standard, but stone everything...  PROS: Room control, modern look, location on the strip, 3 free pools and the bed was really nice and soft!  CONS: Wait time at check in (15 minutes), high resort fee, prices for things in the hotel were steep ($6 for a coffee), overall hotel cost was high (~ $140 after taxes and fees).  I would probably come back here, but not for the standard rate... But it was sure fun to do it once! If the price was a little more competitive to other hotels on the strip ($80-$120) I think they would make a killing!

I must say that this place was very enjoyable... We came here around noon on a Monday to find the place pretty empty, but I have a lot of German heritage, so I am having sausage and beers!  I got two sausages with a soft pretzel (off the lunch menu, see photo) and they were AMAZING! Even the mustard that came on the side was good, and I hate that crap most of the time! I also ordered the Hofbrau Hofbräu Dunkel beer (see photo), a 5.5 by volume. It had a nice full flavor, not to heavy and because it was made there it makes it just a little extra special...  We also had a pork sandwich on the table, a potato pancake, and a veggie burger... The fries are worth mentioning as well... VERY good!  I would love to come here on a weekend to sing and drink with a big crowd, but that didn't happen this go around. If I was ever in the area again, I will defiantly come back!

Not sure why there are so many poor reviews for this place...  I came here on a random Wednesday afternoon/evening by myself for a quick dinner between work and conference calls. I was quickly seated and waited on just as fast. Food came quickly, BLT (photo attached). The decor of the place was really nice... nothing to fancy but still unique and Vegas worthy.  Price: a BLT and a coke, plus tip, 20$. Ya that may seem steep, but this is the strip in Vegas... you're lucky to get a drink for less than $10.  I wouldn't suggest bringing a woman here on a first date, or if your looking for the glam and glits of the strip don't come. But if you want a decently priced hot meal, say between hitting the pool all day and the room for some pre-game drinks, this place is just fine.

It's funny that a place like this gets 5 stars from me because when you think about 5 star restaurants in Las Vegas, you don't think of an older themed place in The Orleans hotel off the strip... But I am gana be honest with you... For the price, thi place really was great.  We were immediately served fancy sparkling water at no additional charge (none of that they ask you and charge you for better), and ordered a glass of wine and a rum and coke. My R&C was nice and strong but didn't taste like pure rum... The bread was delicious and served with 2 cheese wrapped grapes where were delicious.  Also, I wanted to make a special note about the house salad (photo attached). It  was absolutely delicious!!! Probably the best house salad I have ever had... It was almost a cob salad at heart... Just amazing!  Finally, the main meal... I got the Colorado Lamb: Traditional Herb Crusted Half Rack   Lollipops over Hummus and topped with Olive Tapenade and Cucumber Yogurt Sauce Cooked perfectly, great flavor... I would have preferred it served with a potato side dish, but beggars can't be choosers...  Total for all that food, with top, was $115.00. Now that may seem expensive, but if you go down to the strip, a meal of that quality and size would have been closer to $200.00, so I was impressed.  Great service, decent prices, great flavors, all around a great dinner.

I have rented cars out of the LAS airport multiple times, and I have never had any issues at all. You grab the bus over from the airport and the ride takes about 7 minutes. You walk into the main hub building and turn right... Can't miss it!  I have always had reservations and they have never been a problem. Walk into the lot, grab your keys and go! I had an unlimited miles mid size car for a total of 28 hours (one night) and the cost not including fuel was $123.00... Mind you I picked up and dropped off at the same location.  The drop off is super easy (easy access from highway 15) and quick. Pull up, they do an inspection and print you out your official receipt, bing bamb boom, no problem!  TIP: If you are dropping off and plan to catch a flight, the entire process to get into the garage and to the airport takes about 20-30 minutes including the bus ride over... Plan accordingly!

Well, despite all the negative reviews of this place, I actually REALLY enjoyed it!  I came here with my cousin on a Tuesday night because she lives close and knows the bar tender. Her name was Brittany (I believe) and she was the sweetest bar tender, not to mention easy on the eyes! We did some gambling and got all kinds of delicious drinks! She's a big Keno player, and I stick to the video blackjack: which for the record, not many bars have video black jack you can play for a quarter. So big plus in my book for that!  The entertainment was this kid named Jeremiah who could play anything from Dave Matthews, to Doobie Brothers and some songs he wrote on his on. Kind of a one man band, playing all acoustic guitar. I requested some country at the end of the night (CHICKEN FRIED - ZAC BROWN BAND) and he said he had never played that song... BUT STILL could play the chorus... Really impressive!  All-in-all, this place was very enjoyable, and would absolutely come back, especially on Tuesday nights when that Jeremiah kid plays! Come for the gambling, stay for the entertainment!
