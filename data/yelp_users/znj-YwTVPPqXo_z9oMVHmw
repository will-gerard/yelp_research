Excellent service and food!! The Raviolis are a Must! Chicken Parm and lasagna are the Best I've had.

Best pie in the valley. From the crust to the sauce to the cheese. Hands down, best in town.

Fantastic food at a great price. Love the lemon chicken soup complimentary appetizer and house salad. Pasteetsio is my favorite. George the owner is extremely personable.

Average at best. Not sure why the rating is so hi. It's a hot pocket and the portion size Is small. Not satisfying
