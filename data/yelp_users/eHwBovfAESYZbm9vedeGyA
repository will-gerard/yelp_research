I only gave this place 2 stars because of the environment that it is in.  A "hard to find place" is an understatement if it's dark outside and you have never been here.   I have to agree, the crust of the pizza is amazingly flakey and delicious.  I'm a crusty guy, so I like good crust and though it's up there with a soft boboli it's still easy to eat and won't rough up your mouth.  I ordered the Ephesus Pizza with lamb skewers ($16.00 large).  It is a white pizza with minimal ingredients except for the lamb skewers.  They packed on 8-9 small skewers of lamb and I have to admit, the lamb was very tasty and tender.  The problem I have with this place is the filthy, trash laden environment it sits in.  It's on the mezzanine level (2nd floor) of a some financial building and when I got there, the exterior doors to the building were locked and luckily a group of people showed up and punched in the code to get one of the side doors opened...it was strange.  However, when you walk in that side door, I was faced with the stairwell with trash cans spewed about.  when I entered the pizza/sandwich joint, it was in disarray, bread was in crates on the floor and trash cans were overflowing.  The bathroom was in a construction zone and filthy.  All of this added up to being afraid to eat anything because you were unsure as to how fresh the food was and how well kept the kitchen may or may not have been.  I'm not a fluffy guy, but I need some fluff in my establishments...look clean, feel clean, feel safe and I can live with whatever you dish out, but when first impressions are nasty and dirty, it hits homeplate way before the food hits my mouth.   I still like the pizza and I will only send my pot smoking, beer drinking partying friends to this place, because I would be afraid of what others may think of it and consequently, think of me and my tastes.

I have been dying to come to this place for several years, but just didn't get around to it.  I met the original owner/chef years ago on the way to Mexico City and since then I wanted to visit the restaurant.  Well thanks to Groupon, it was the final motivation to my butt in there.  First off, I don't truly classify this restaurant as "mexican" food as most people know it.  The food is much more complex than typical mexican food and thats the part I love about it.  I was there on a Tuesday evening around 5pm.  The place was already busy inside, but I was never greeted at the entrance by anyone.  I simply walked in, looked around and found more comfort at the bar outside.  The bartender was young, new and not really experienced enough to give me great insight into the menu selections, but that was ok, he was new to the place.  I observed the level of service throughout and service or greeting of people arriving at the restaurant was almost an after thought. But hey, Groupon was expiring and they were getting busy.  It seemed to catch them off guard.    Chips and Salsa were very good and both salsas had excellent, mild flavor, but didn't over power anything.  You could truly enjoy the taste of the salsa.  I wasn't sure if there were nopales in the salsa, so I asked, but didn't get an answer.  I next ordered the Huitlacoche crepas (9.95), they were very good, slightly sweet with plenty of cheese in the crepe and topped with a ample amount of pomegranate.  It was good, but I would not order it again, more because of the sweetness of it, rather than the creation itself.  It was well presented and very tasty.  My meal was brought to me shortly after the arrival of the appetizer, consequently my meal was returned, and later brought back, but not quite as hot.  But it was DELICIOUS.  The Lamb Adobo is certainly an item not to be missed.   It was tender and juicy, ample amount of food and the Adobo (Ancho chilie sauce ))was extremely good.   I had it with a side of rice and beans, although the portions of both were smaller than I would have expected.  The Lamb Adobo is clearly a winner on their menu, and is the motivating factor to return and try other unique and delicious dinners.    I waited for a check for more than 20 minutes and then once the credit card was placed, it took another 10 minutes to notice it.  They were busy, I'll give them that.  However with the food as great as it is, I would hope that service levels could be escalated.  Simple things such as recognizing you when you enter the building even to say "we'll be right with you" is all it takes.  Checking on you after you have your meal are basic service elements that can use improvement at this establishment.  For my first, much anticipated visit, I was relatively disappointed only in the service levels, but certainly not the food.  The food is delciouis and I will be back.

Tuck is certainly "tucked" away in the neighborhood that is has landed itself.  What a pleasant surprise!  When we Looked at the place from outside, we automatically knew that it was fitting for what we were looking for, small, but open and well lit but also good ambiance.  There is one large family size table for a party of 10.  The rest of the tables are two tops and four tops. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and treated very well.  Now the food.....we started with cheese curds that were very tender and absolutely delicious and very lightly fried. The Mac and cheese is amazing!!! There was no real ingredient  that jumped out at us, the overall combination of ingredients made this a truly delicious dish.  I highly recommend this.  We then had the skirt steak which was also extremely tender, the rub they used had a slight kick to it, but not overpowering. It was served with potatoes and lentil combination, that was simply delicious. The skirt steak was fabulous!  We were not impressed with the garlic and bread for $5.00 and would have been happy with the baguette bread (plain)  but they charged 2.00 for that. Overall I love this place and will certainly be back for more flavor challenges.

Knowledgable bartender, excellent food selections.   Burgers are FANTASTIC.  We went in late evening.  Being a person that simply loves great food, I tend to have the bartender, waiter or waitress guide me on what to order.  I have passed this place for years and years, always had a curiosity to go in there.  I loved the amibiance was crisp, clean, small but very well done.  TV's lined the bar for sports and each booth is lined up against the wall so the TV screens are also in view of each person in the place.  The female bartender was amazingly knowledgeable and led us down the right path.  We orderd the wonderful asparagus with goat cheese, the WINGS were absolutely delcious with no single flavor that overpowered another, very good non-traditiona wings.  The sweet and spicy burger was amazingly tasty, but again, excellent blend of flavors, nothing too strong, very creative.  The peppercorn burger was also excellent, however the cheeseburger was rather uneventful, but it's also a 'cheeseburger" with no added love.  We left this place 100 percent satisfied and excited for the next taste test.  If you look at all of my reviews, I most always stop short of giving 5 stars, it was without a doubt on this one that give 5 stars.   I love great tasting food, doesn't have to be big portions, or pretty, just has to be tasty and thats what I found!!  I simply don't 'get the burger hype of Deluxe, Modern Burger or Zin Burger, the burgers here are much better and around the same price.

I really like this place!!!!  For a number of reasons, friendly service, excellent ambience with a trendy, comfortable feel, good food and a great bar to sit and just be friendly.  We ordered the Greek appetizer, which is very common in many places, but the presentation of this one, made it quite different from the rest.  On the bottom was hummus, topped with traditional Greek style cucumber, tomato with light olive oil dressing, and a side of Tzazitki and pita.  Unique and quite good.  More pita would have been nice.  For lunch we ordered the Porkwich, recommended by the waitress and a side of the Mac and Cheese. The sandwich was delcious, but the Mac and cheese lacked "punch" and I was not wowed by it.  I'll save that for the Tuck Shop next time.  We also ordered the ribs and they were tender, tasty and really had a nice unique flavor.  We had a side of the potatoes and OMG, they were delicious.  I really wanted to try the Crab Cake BLT and will definitely do that next time.  The best part...CHURN.  I love how it is connected to the restaurant and you can get an entirely different experience at the same location.  We had a pricey "create your own" sundae and enjoyed it on the beautiful patio with misters outside.  It was very nice to be able to leave the restaurant, but not and enjoy an outdoor experience with ice cream in 105 degrees and feel very comfortable.   Enjoy!

I came across this place recently (SW corner of 24th street/Indian School) and I have to say I find the food to be excellent.  The cuisine is mix of Indian, Pakistani and Afghan, designed to suit every taste, from spicy to not so spicy.   I have had several items but , such as the tender and juicy lamb kabob and most recently the Chicken Boti which was spicy and very good!  They serve goat, lamb, beef and chicken in a variety of dishes and many are able to be shared.  The service is somewhat slower because you generally have the owner being the watier and the menu explainer.  He will take the time to explain the food, how it is prepared and what may suit the taste you are looking for.   His wife loves to cook and that is how this place got started.  Interior decor is nothing special, very typical of an authentic place that just serves good authentic food!.  The Nan bread is fresh, warm and tender.  The hummus didn't really fit my taste, I have other places that I prefer hummus, it was more oily than most.  When I was in there last night, There are approximately 10 tables in the place and during my last visit I could overhear each table making comments about how good their food was.    There is a charge for bottled water (if you ask for "water) and you will pay a .35 cent transaction fee for credit cards, testament again..to authenticity :)    I love this place and when I feel the itch for something different and adventurous for my taste buds,  I have not been disappointed yet.    I just wish they could pipe some low authentic music and it would top off the place!
