The Rusty Spur Update 2008:  Of course our first stop in Scottsdale after dropping our bags off at the hotel was to the Rusty Spur.  The bar is still fun, but poo-poo on them for the new Arizona no-smoking law.  We had a hilarious female performer on our first day there who kept calling my friends out by making them sing and dance.  That's so friggin cool of her.  (I'll update this when I double-check what her name is.)  Our ever-familiar bartenders were no longer working there.  Sadly, our favorite bartender, Thelma, quit working there five months ago.  She was one of the folks who would take care of our loud, rowdy, alcoholic crew.  At any rate, still a fun place, but -1* for no more Thelma and no more smoking.  This place is still going to remain an annual destination even without those things, but what a shame to have them gone. **************************************************************************** I can't wait to go back to Scottsdale for Spring Training and hit up our hole, the Rusty Spur.  I'm heading out there and I look forward to the bartenders and live band for my fourth year.  The bartenders are awesome and remember my name from year to year.  That's pretty cool, since we're only there for six days every year in March.  Enjoy the chill vibe inside.  This will be updated again upon my return this year.

For those folks heading to Scottsdale for the SF Gians Spring Training, this is your hotel.  My friends and I have been staying at this hotel for the past four years.  The location can't be beat.  You are only one block from the stadium and within walking distance of Old Town Scottsdale.  Located within walking distance are tons of restaurants and bars, meaning you can eat and drink to your heart's content without having to worry about one of those dastardly DUIs.  This hotel offers (as far as I know) only suites, but that is certainly not a complaint on my part.  Each room comes with a full shower/tub, toilet and a separate sink/vanity area.  There is a sitting room when you first walk in with a desk (the hotel offers free WiFi and a broadband through an ethernet cable).  Also, there is a TV in an armoire with drawers, a closet, a small refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, extra sink, counter space, coffee table and a loveseat/sofabed.    The bedroom has two queen-sized beds, a nightstand, a dresser, another TV, and a small closet area.  There is a set of doors separating the bedroom from the sitting area, but they don't do much for noise.  One of the guys in my room was sucking in the walls with his snoring so my other roommate shut the door.  That did nothing to keep us from waking up as a result of the racket coming from the other room.  From my experiences, the rooms' layouts are alike.  A recommendation of mine, although not always available, is to request a poolside room.  I smoke, but I don't like smoking rooms.  I always request a room with a patio so I can go outside to handle my business.  It's also fun to hang out on the deck in beautiful weather.  This hotel offers daily complimentary breakfast.  I have never made it down there that early, but I understand they have cereals, breads, etc.  Typical breakfast fare for a place offering free breakfast.  At night, however, they have a free happy hour with two types of beer (Bud LIght and I think Miller Lite), red wine, white wine, chex mix and chips and salsa.  You have free-flowing booze for something like two hours.  NICE!!!  It's great to sit in the hot tub during happy hour with your cocktail and just hang out.  The Holiday Inn Express also has a workout room, although the room is somewhat on the small side.  It has two treadmills, one elliptical and a weight center (like a bowflex).  The hotel offers complimentary shuttle service between the hotel and the airport, as well as local drop-off until 10pm, if available.  The staff are generally nice also.  Do I sound like I'm selling you this hotel or what?!?!  Now for the down side.  Check in is late.  They pretty much never have availability prior to their posted time of 4pm.  Checkout is at 12pm, though, so that's a big plus.  The other bad thing: prices keep skyrocketing for this joint.  They don't honor loyalty and cut you a break for staying there year after year.  I'll probably continue to stay there if the rates remain below $200.00, but the rates are quickly inching up.  Hope this is enough information to answer all questions relating to this hotel.  If not, visit http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/ and search for the Scottsdale, AZ location.  Good luck and happy travelling!

This place is so unique to me.  You see, in San Francisco, I haven't been to one club that has a hair band.  The group (Metalhead?) is seriously awesome and I love watching everyone rock out.  -1* for charging a cover to get in.  I don't pay cover charges (thank you friends for paying for me).  The drinks are cool, strong and the bartenders keep 'em flowing.  I think, bottom line, that's what most of us alcoholics want.  I'd think the bar would make more than enough  extra money without a cover charge, but that's just me.  Another one of those places that I have to visit every time I'm in Scottsdale.  I'll be back, Martini Ranch!

I did not think Ra was that great the past few times I've been.  It has that "trendy" vibe to it, which I think is way overrated.  Being a food whore, I care more about my food than my ambiance.  Ra appears to cater to people who are looking for Americanized Japanese food.  The food is not great, but neither is it truly terrible.  The atmosphere is cutesy, but I like more chill and unpretentious restaurants.  I'm pretty sure that Scottsdale has to have better sushi than what can be found at Ra.

Last year, the group I was with and I tried everything on the menu.  Or so it seemed.  Or so I remember.  I don't know; I was drunk.  I do remember, however, that their prime rib was awesome!  I'll try to update this review when I get back this year if I go again.

I would have given this place five stars, but...  I went with a large group of friends while we were in town for Spring Training (Go Giants!).  I felt the service was great.  Our waitress made sure our drinks were never empty and the food arrived quickly after ordering it.  With a group of seven of us eating, nobody had complaints, which is rare.  Now for drinks...  I had the S.R.A.M.F.  I had to get it because I had no clue what the acronym would stand for.  Our waitress quickly filled me in: Saddle Ranch Adios Mother Fucker.  Now who can pass up a drink with a name like that?!?!  The drinks were good...typical prices for a bar.  Food was reasonably priced as well.  Oh yeah,  I also got a kickass pirate cowboy hat for only $29.99.  Am I a tourist?  Hell yeah!  Did the hat kick ass anyway?  Absolutely.  Now, for the -1* part.  The Saddle Ranch had a mechanical bull riding contest.  It looked like fun, but I wasn't drunk enough yet.  So...two friends of one of my friends on the trip decided to jump on the bull.  The first one on ended up dislocating her left thumb.  She got off the bull and asked the staff to help her put it back in place.  They refused.  She ultimately had to ask her friend to put it back in its socket.  That was gross.  At any rate, the bar staff were less than helpful.  She was half joking about it at the bar and the bartender said some rude crap to her.    It's a shame, because we had an otherwise excellent time at that spot.  I'll probably go back next year when we're in town for Spring Training, so until then this review stands.  If I go back, I'll update it then.
