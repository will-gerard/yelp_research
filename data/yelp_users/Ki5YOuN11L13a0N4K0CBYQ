I've been a customer of this location since 98. The food is amazing! The whole menu is really 2nd to none and you can always count on some sort of special.  It really feels like I'm back in NY when I step in this place. The service has always been a genuine kind of friendly and they're always quick, even during the Fri and Sat night rushes.

Half Moon is a favorite amongst my group of friends. The staff is generally beyond friendly and the establishment is always very clean. Cant go wrong with 1/2 price apps and $3 drafts during happy hour (mon-fri 3-7) and reverse hh (10-close nightly). They also have the buddy pack (2 pounds of wings and 4 draft beers) for $20 during all Suns, Coyotes and Dbacks games! They have a rewards program that allows regulars to save $10 every now and then. Also one of the few places Ive found that does not charge a cover for UFC PPVs. In the case that you have too much fun, a free shuttle service is available for use within 3 miles. *Some constructive criticism* They desperately need to update their directv connection. The picture on many of the tvs often times appears distorted or stretched bc they dont have hd connections. All things considered though, if you live in the area you would be missing out by not giving this place a try.

BEWARE: Multiple items STOLEN from glove box. Noticed missing items and returned within 5 minutes and was essentially told tough luck you have no proof but you can have a free wash next time. Ultimately,  shame on me for forgetting the items in there to begin with but really?
