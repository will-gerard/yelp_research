Their  wings & pizza are sooooo good . Will be coming here again . They also have lunch specials ! The setting is casual . Not too pricey either .

If I could give this place no stars I would ! They suck , food was sloppy . I know it's not a 5 star restaurant but how are you going to charge me for a side of Mac sauce then give me a Ridiculously small amount .  I thought it was a joke ! Never going back and I hope these are not the ones asking for 15$ an hour

If I could pick zero stars I would ! This place is full of cheap clothes that tear on the first wash & their employees are stuck up , useless people . I tried to return a shirt w all tags & the receipt & their manager said I couldn't ! She even tried calling me a liar . NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN

Came to this place cs I heard the wings were really good . I mean the food was great BUT the service was awful !! The waiters take forever to bring your food/refills . They forget everything & totally ignore you . HORRIBLE !!

This place is always great . Our server was fun & nice . I love their tour of Italy . Only bad part is they got rid of their cream sodas but you can still low key ask them to make you one lol

Was not happy at all with my experience . The first time I went I actually liked how the girl did my hair (I forgot her name) but then I made the mistake of coming back but to a different hair stylist & that's where I went wrong. Even though she was very nice , I hated my color. I called before I booked my appt & asked how much it would be for just my roots to be retouched - I was told it starts at 55$ but I never imagined I would end up paying 115$ . I mean I wouldn't mind paying that much if I would've loved my results but I didn't even like it one bit . I have never had my hair done & leave with my roots unmatched to the rest of my hair . I mean it was just a root touch up for gods sake. It literally looks like I have yellow roots . I had high expectations for this place but I'm sorry to say even the Beauty salon schools deliver better results then this at a cheaper price too. I will not be returning .. I mean they could tell I wasn't happy & didn't even try to fix it. The stylist told me she didn't want to re bleach it because my hair was already too damaged but to return in 3 weeks to redo it. They could've at least gave me a percentage off to return but why in the world would I want to be charged 115$ for such bad service

Save your money . This place is ridiculous . Worst customer service . We were there this past Sunday and only enjoyed about 10 minutes when they suddenly closed down the rides temporarily due to bad weather which I understood . The thing is we decided maybe we should just get like credit or something and come back a different day since we got there pretty late and would only get to enjoy the park for about an hour an a half . Well when I went to go talk to someone at customer service I was told "they had a warning sign about weather" which I did not see at all upon arrival ! Only signs I did see were about some rides being closed due to filming . Every one was saying they "just put the signs up a little bit after closing down the rides" so basically they had the nerve to lie . When I asked for corporate number they instead gave me the number to the main office (water park) . Unbelievable !!!!!!!!
