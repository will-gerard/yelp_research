Family run business that my husband and I have been loyal too now for 7 years!  Owners Tony & Sandy are great service focused leaders and very creative, delivering the highest level of quality!  We highly recommend you make it your every time place- you won't be disappointed!

Love this place normally but obnoxious and loud "musician" on Wednesday nights will keep our group away every time. Calling out people eating dinner with friends and making insulting comments was very unnecessary. Very disappointed to hear he's there every Wednesday night. No more work groups there during the dinner hour that night going forward. Dinner crowd cleared out shortly after blaring sound started. You would think the staff would alert management that their tips are impacted by this. Last table of 8 I host there. Sorry friends!

I received a very nice follow up call today after my discharge.  I asked about having cardiac records sent to my cardiologist and was provided with the number 480-728-7103 to have them fax my ekgs to my doc. She advised me to have the doc's fax number available.  I called the number and David (who answered) told me to call my doctor's office and have them request the records since he would not send the records.  I told him telling sick people to jump thru hoops requiring multiple steps is not acceptable to which he responded "well it's not jumping through hoops and you're on the phone so you are clearly capable.."  I asked to speak to his supervisor and he said he was the supervisor.  Not impressed that you have put someone who is insensitive and condescending in charge of something so important at your facility. Every one has a boss and clearly his is not aware of how he talks to people or thinks it is ok.    I love this hospital.  The medical staff is phenomenal. I wish that experience, even if its a no response, would have carried through professionally.

Excellent stylist in Heather. She's wonderful and consistent. She's been taking great care of my hair for nearly 8 years. I highly recommend.

Made 3 trips to this store looking to spend $1,500 on patio furniture.  First trip I was sucked in by the grand opening sign.  Was told by an older gentleman in the store by himself (no customers) that he expected the type of bar stools I wanted by Saturday.  Returned back on Saturday and now the place had a lonely younger guy who said he could get anything I wanted in 3-5 days.  I told him that the other man had said he'd have more and that's why we came back.  I would've called but couldn't find a listing for the store.  He said "WE come up first on google- you must not be searching correctly." I quickly responded that after 30 years of managing customer service operations I knew full well how to google. I again shared that we were having company and building a new patio and wanted chairs ASAP.  He said "I have to keep my $100k worth of inventory on the floor to be competitive with the big box  stores, so I'd have to order what I wanted and get it in 3-5 days"..but he would have more in over the next few days.  Third visit young mouthy guy again, I asked the height about a specific chair in the store & asked for a tape measure...he proceeded to look in the catalog to determine what height they were.  Again I said I was having company in from out of town and wanted to buy 4-8 bar height stools & I couldn't understand why I wasn't able after 3 weeks of inquiries to get something in the store.  I was told "Get out...we don't want your kind of people here..."  I told him he lacked even basic customer service skills and that I would yelp about my experience.  He challenged me to go ahead.  So now that my visitor's are gone and I've spent my $1,200 on beautiful cast aluminum chairs that I got delivered free from Amazon (in 2 days) I'm posting here and on FACEBOOK & on any other site to insure that MY KIND of PEOPLE do not frequent a store that clearly will be out of business in 6 months because they are so indifferent to their potential customers. Heaven forbid you ask a question & expect them to know the answer.  I dragged my husband in there each time- he can barely walk due to his progressive cancer & he can't believe they treated us with such disdain.

I wasn't with my son when he rented but I was happy to bring it back after he wore it. Horrible quality tuxes for rent. The shirt my son got with his $180 tux rental had severe neck sweat stains. Gross. The pants still had the hem pins in them and the material felt like asbestos. The clerk said "yep they are horrible but that's what you get when you rent something that 1000 people have worn."  I confirmed that you at least expect clean and decent or very cheap. This was neither. Won't use them again. They know they are screwing teenagers but want them to buy suits instead for less. Wow.
