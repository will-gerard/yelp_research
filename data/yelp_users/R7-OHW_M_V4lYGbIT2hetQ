Back at work on a Monday morning recovering from a crazy bach party weekend, so we're talking about the Stratosphere bungee jump that went down and it somehow triggered my co-worker's faint memory of some hole in the wall from 6 years ago because of its proximity.  But at the time she didn't remember the name of the place.  She's telling me she only had it once, that a former UNLV professor took her there for the best "ice cream" she's ever had and that you can only order it outside.  She described it as a little shack with some ghetto ass window bars.    Since we're hella bored in the office and we hate our manager.  We decided to annoy her by being unproductive doing google and yelp searches trying to find this place.  According to my intense online research, the only place I see close by the Stratosphere in the ice cream/desserts category is Luv-It Frozen Custard and showed her the picture of the outside.  She says, "THAT'S IT, it has to be the place and we have to go today!"   Now I've never had frozen custard before so I didn't really know the difference between frozen custard or ice cream.  She asked, "You fly, I'll buy?"  "Well if your going to twist my arm, Let's roll than!"  But it was 11:30 am at the time and Luv-It doesn't open until 1pm.  I don't usually take lunch at 1pm but today was an exception to satisfy her sweet tooth.    We bail for "lunch" at 12:45 exiting off Sahara,  As I turn left onto LV Blvd I was laughing driving up realizing OMG it's one block from the muthaphukkin OG, hoping it wasn't a bad omen (rewind 2 nights before: http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-olympic-garden-las-vegas#hrid:NKIO3Tyry85byIIVYrWjwQ).  We arrived and there's like already 7 people in line waiting and it was still 12:55.  So I knew this must be legit! There was only two flavors available which were Vanilla and Pineapple just made in the lab.  Since it's only a one man shop, they don't crank out many flavors at 1:00.  Unless you order like 1/2 a gallon I believe than there's a variety of other flavors already "hard packed" so its frozen solid.    Some of the regulars in line recommended the Luv-It sundae with Vanilla flavor so I went with that and the owner was nice enough to hook me up with extra pecans which complemented the vanilla flavor very well.  You can really taste the vanilla and the egg whipped in.  But if I did a blindfold taste and put out a cup of vanilla frozen yogurt or frozen custard I don't think I can still tell the difference.  I look forward to trying other flavors without the all the sundae toppings next time.  I'll probably only be back on the weekends because of their weird hours.  It's CASH only and if you don't mention what flavor you want it's always going to be vanilla by default.

I'm seeing all these talk threads about where to go for a bachelor's party.  Well, don't GO HERE unless you want to get screwed, no pun intended.  Voted the Best Strip Club in Las Vegas....uhh doubt it.  This was my first time and probably will be my last time here.  2 Floors.  Sausage fest for the bachelorettes upstairs and what seemed like approximately 88% Southeastern asian chicks downstairs.  The other 12% were of the non-white variety.  We arrived at about 11pm so you figure this is the "creme de la creme" of the talent.    I literally ONLY lasted 20 minutes inside OG.  It all started with a camera!  It was never meant to be used inside BUT shiznit happens.  Security never gave me any warning and said, "it's time to say good night".  My response was "GFY and no your not taking my camera!"  What sucked was I never got to buy my buddy a dance here, but I got a pretty detailed report about the debauchery (i'll spare you those details) and shadiness after I got the boot from the fellas.  Apparently everybody saw the one of the dancers just blatantly grab a fresh bottle of GG from our table and just run off with it.  The manager accused my buddy of lying about the incident and the dancer finally fessed up and apologized.  But when it was all said and done.....they replaced it with a bottle of Absolut....WTF kinda BS is this?!?  Yes the hummer limo ride was free and so was the cover...but it's still "slim pickings" at OG.  Sure you may get your "bang for your buck" BUT I can't ever recommend a bach party with OG in the mix and you'd have to knock me out and drag me in order to go back.  Juss stick to the Rhino or Sapphire.

Best Spring training stadium in AZ!  I've been to 6 of them.  Salt River at the Talking Stick is a close second for me after Scottsdale Stadium.  I recommend going to both at least!    On certain games you can easily buy the cheapest tickets and "upgrade" yourself to the first three rows behind the dugout.  Who knows you might even score two foul balls and have one signed by my all time fave Giant Will the Thrill Clark!    Street parking was a breeze.  Only like 6 blocks from the stadium.  Who needs to pay $12 bucks unless you don't like to walk.  Great options for grub at the concessions for a "spring training stadium"

I live two blocks from this place and had yet to go.  But if your going to Firefly it up, the first time is always better with the Yelperazzi Posse for Angela H's Adios Fiesta.   I love me some tapas or I like to refer to as the spanish version of dim-sum.  I've had great sangrias back in NYC and SF, so my expectations were high.  The sangrias are very good and nicely chilled and had plenty of fruit, absolutely order a pitcher or three.  I could've downed a whole pitcher by myself!  The Tuna tartare which was really good with sliced mangoes on top.  I also tried the Chorizo Clams which was kind of bland...probably wouldn't order that one again.  Veggie empanadas were good, but I don't think I've ever had a bad empanada that I wouldn't destroy.    Unfortunately I missed out on the 3-6 happy hour but great to know for next time and look forward to checking out the downtown location also.

Following the YEE: Yelp Elites' First Date, c. 1985 at Ferraro's.  Me and some of the Yelparazzi posse bailed from the Double Down dive and I suggested we head over to the good ole "Restaurant" inside E I.  YES, it is on the corner of Koval and East Flamingo.  It isn't exactly the happiest place on earth but aside from the occasional smell of tapioca, it's home to the $6.99 Sirloin Steak special.    My review is only for the "Steak Special"  The "Restaurant" mostly been a hit with most locals and tourists on Yelp.  Tonight it was a BIG MISS!  I unfortunately got really sick after eating my steak with food poisoning symptoms.  And pretty much spent the rest of the evening in the oval office.  I had ordered it medium rare and it came out uhh medium well and a little burnt on the top.  I'll definitely take Andy T's suggestion and order it rare next time if I ever decide to come back.  His ball of flesh came out perfectly grilled and medium rare.  Oh and BTW the meal comes with your choice of soup of the day or your a-typical iceberg lettuce salad drenched with salad dressing (which may I note could've been the culprit that led to my "closed door meetings"), potato, green beans....blah blah blah!  I'm not even going to say much about the service here because it generally sucks but bad service and cheap eats tend to go together like coffee with cigarettes.  Anyhoo on another interesting note, on our way inside, my buddies and Andy T. get out of our cars and I swear I went totally blind for 10 seconds by the sight of sum nasty hoochie mama flapping her mouth "Yea u know u want some of this, uh huh". Jeeez...instead of eating that shitty piece of steak I so wanted to chuck it at that walking skanky mess.  Eeeww!

I came here on co-worker recommendation.  I don't know many legit BBQ places which have drive thru windows which is great for sake of convenience.  I ordered the King AKA  the Pulled Pork Sando Combo.  The Regular size is about 8 oz. of pulled pork smokey deliciousness but when I devoured it  felt like a 12 ouncer.  It came with 2 sides.  I chose the creamed corn and the green beans.  It was the first time I'd eaten creamed corn.  I was good but I prefer creamed spinach but that's not available.  The green beans were bleh and will try some other side next time.   Next trip it will all about the Pork Ribs and Brisket!  This place has to be right up there for Best BBQ in Vegas!

I had just left a business meeting and after finding out that my wireless adapter had crapped out on my laptop.  I was desperate to find "internet cafe" in the area.  I stumbled upon Rejavanate when I drove by this strip mall.  But, I need to plug into a ethernet cable and was hoping they could accomodate.  So its unlimited free internet if you have your laptop and buy something of course.  One of the co-owners Tim Miller was nice enough to allow me to borrow their only available spare ethernet cable unplugged from their printer in the back of the cafe.  I know most of cafes would've just said screw you.   If your a business traveler and looking for a place to relax with free internet and a decent cup of coffee or smoothie check out Rejavanate.  Don't pay through the nose for 30 minutes of internet at those business centers at the Strip hotels for like $20 bucks (tourists beware cuz they won't tell you and you'll just start surfing).  They need more cafes like this in Vegas!!!

Great happy hours after 12am chill spot...comfortable leather couches.  Cool bartenders hooking me up with some strong cocktails and goose without the extra charge!  Got me some fries that were legit.  I think they were fresh cut , but I was so f'd up, they could've been the frozen Ore-Ida kind  for all I know.  Right in the heart of Chinatown.  Too bad that hot filipina server was married...wow was she smoking hot!  Great service and very attentive.  I'll be back for maybe March Madness.

For my buddy's bachelor party weekend...I suggested staying at the Platinum Hotel for the value and location being 2 blocks off Flamingo and LV Blvd.  They booked this suite for the $99 per night deal which I've seen on other reviews.  Front desk and room service was great and their never was any issues according to the gang.  Decent view from the 15th floor and I can see the front door to my pad from their balcony which we all laughed about.   I may have been drunk off my ass from blue gatorade jungle juice and watching Pretty Woman when I was inside the suites, but I remember it's like staying in a 1 bedroom condo with 2 queens, sofa bed, full kitchen + washer and dryer.     Platinum requires a $400 deposit charged upfront when you check in.  Check out time was 10pm which is great for convenience.  There is no slot machines or video poker in the lobby which is great.  I despise them with a passion.   Minus one star because there is ONLY valet parking but the attendant was nice enough to let me park for 15 minutes.  AM/PM is next door for convenient alcoholic beverages + water balloons + chewing gum.

Capriotti's Who?  This place is friggin' legit.  This wasn't close to where I work either.  But for I just had a hunch, that I was in for a treat.  If your an East Coast transplant wondering where can I get an Italian Combo and is totally against putting mustard or mayo on there hoagie or sub (depending on where your from)....well Hougan's is the spot!   They even put hot capicola on their combo!  Now that's legit!  Can't wait to try the cheesesteak next time.  One of the ladies who worked there was munching on one and she said "Yup eat these for breakfast too" Now that's legit!

I came back in wanting that delicious Italian Combo.....but the picture of that Meatball sandwich was calling out to me DEVOUR me.  It could've used a sprinkling of parmesan cheese on top but the seasoned balls were ginormous and had lots of ooey gooey melty provoloney cheesiness on a soft roll.    I'm telling you if I run into anybody again who tells me OOH...that Subway makes the best meatball sandwich, I'm going to have slap them upside the head with one of these bad boys.  With that said, as much as I enjoyed it wasn't enough to surpass that Italian Combo, which is still my 5 star winner.  Next on my to do list is the Slick Track Sandwich!

Holy sh*t I'm so sad.  Drove by today and the whole place completely empty.  Closed!  No more Red Rice AKA Crack (just so addicting and delicious)!  No more Mongolian Chicken and BBQ Chicken with grill marks unlike certain Hawaiian BBQ places that serve BBQ Chicken.    Darrell was a cool kid and took care of me everytime with that extra salad dressing.  Just goes to show you no matter how good the food is any place can shut down at any time in this economy.  I'm hoping they moved to another location.  I'll be on the look-out if I find out anything!  In the meantime, I need to find a recipe on how to make that Red Rice.  Damn damn!

This Review is for the Wet Your Appetite for LV Restaurant Week on August 30, 2010:  First off shout out to Debbie N. for hooking up the comp tix.  It was certainly well worth the $30.10 admission to get in!  Restaurant week certainly kicked off in style for a great cause to help fight hunger in supporting the Three Square Food Bank! It was a great mix of music, food and mermaids! WTH?! Yes!  Mermaids!  Wet Republic was a great location to hold this event. When I saw the calendar event pop up I wasn't exactly sure what to expect since this is my first ever Restaurant Week event in Las Vegas.   Me and Stephanie L. arrived on time and the line went fairly quickly.  Upon entry, you're provided with a card to be stamped at every booth there!  As I'm stopping by each booth and trying everything the mixture of sweet and savory sorta trick my taste buds a bit.  If I had to do it over again, I wished I asked the chefs questions about the specific ingredients in each sample appetizer.  Highlights of the event for me:  -Nutella Mousse Sweet Burger with Strawberry Ale: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Al0uCu7s9LQEURwV1F6Bfg?select=yUyxRrPDmowBBvM9wvCUSA -Semolina Gnocchi with Braised Duck & Black Truffle Ragu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Al0uCu7s9LQEURwV1F6Bfg?select=_wwPLFUWJS4G2HrHH8cQkg -Sashimi of Harimasa, Vegetable Crudo, Ginger Aromatic Sauce: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Al0uCu7s9LQEURwV1F6Bfg?select=IRj-u1VNIJP13bZvy1k8DA -Soy Glazed Short Ribs, Apple Jalapeno Puree and Rosemary Crumbs: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Al0uCu7s9LQEURwV1F6Bfg?select=4eIVrqMSRSQWs-WhobmqNw -Tuscan Panzanella Salad and Creamy Burrata Cheese: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Al0uCu7s9LQEURwV1F6Bfg?select=lzSNH_h5iqy0SM6O9zdLjA -Mermaids: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Al0uCu7s9LQEURwV1F6Bfg?select=2ZsLwJfj9wSubm3KsoowTA ***Highlight of the night***:  Chef & DJ Hubert Keller getting jiggy wid it on the wheels of steel: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Al0uCu7s9LQEURwV1F6Bfg?select=14OXQnT6Dpe5ep-t-m-hNA    Big thumbs up to all the Celeb Chefs and staff at the MGM/Mirage restaurants that were awesome dealing with the long lines in every booth... even the cover band that was performing all the hits from BEP to BBD was representing!     According to Jieun L. big thumbs down for me being Asian and not feeling the Ginger Margarita!  "You're Asian, how can you NOT like Ginger?"  Also thumbs down for lagging not turning in our completed card in time to the auction table to receive a complimentary key for a chance to unlock the box and win a prize!    But still a great time on a rare "cool" summer evening in the desert!  If I can make it through another year in Vegas, I'll mos def be back next year pho shizzle!

It may be called Lemongrass Cafe but the outside looks like Mel's Diner.    Seemed like a lot of people in the office were craving pho and I mentioned the 10% off via Yelp and that helped seal the deal for lunch.   The clock outside the restaurant said 9:00 but the place was pretty busy at 2 in the afternoon. I like coming here because the staff is always really friendly, and the pho comes out quick before your done wiping down the soup spoon.  I don't like the short wooden chopsticks they give you, but just my only personal pet peeve.    The Bun Bo Hue here is my favorite and the broth consistently has great flavor. *slurp*.  Pho Dac Biet and Bun Thit Nuong get honorable mention also.    Quick and satisfying.  Pho sho!

Once you live in Vegas.  After awhile the Strip gets tired and who wants to deal with the traffic if your driving!  I still love the nightlife and energy on the strip once in awhile.  But like most locals we prefer to stay away unless you work around there.   The M (Marnell) Resort is like my go-to spot for great restaurants/buffet and overall a great place to hang-out and chill to watch sports and play poker.  The Marnell family created and used to own the Rio, which back in the days was known for their overall great service and Village Seafood Buffet, but since they sold it to the Harrah's Corp, it's gone downhill.  Anyways that's a whole another story and review.  Sportsbook:  Live-in game betting for NFL games.  Great selection of TV's around the area showing the featured games.  The Vig Deli next door has decent food for under $10.  My favorite is the spaghetti and meatballs.   Poker room:  Very relaxing and not really noisy relatively speaking.  Great dealers...comfortable chairs...low limits...primarily 1/2 NL or 3/6 Limit.    Veloce Cibo on the 16th floor has an awesome view of the strip and quality seafood/sushi.  Great place to take friends and family from out of town visiting away from the strip.   Overall great atmosphere.  Everybody working there are friendly and helpful.  Beautiful cocktail ladies.  They even have non-smoking gaming areas.  What other casino you know has that option?  When you walk around it doesn't really smell like cigarette smoke which I hate.  Much props to the Marnells for doing a great job with air circulation and the lighting.  I've been told the employees are held to a zero tolerance policy....if they're rude to a guest than they're terminated.    If you're not knowing next time you visit Vegas, if you don't mind renting a car to get around.....seriously consider staying at the M.  Top-notch amenities and certainly the best value!

Having been to the OG location in Manhattan's Meatpacking District, my expectations were going to be high!    I've been a fan of Scott ever since I've tried out some of his recipes from Bold Italio.  Whom I refer to as the anti Mario Batali.  Conant's sense of `new Italian' cooking is also different from Mario, who, with his love of ramps (a type of leek).  Scott sees himself as adapting the Italian concentration on local ingredients with those ingredients which are local to the farms.   I started out with the Mussels and Asparagus Soup was hearty which a nice assortments of spring veggies. The polenta with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms was as usual excellent and the Grilled Bread and Goat Cheese Salad were also great starters.  The boneless Osso Busco with orzo pasta was phenomenal.  It was braised in a boldly flavored sauce.    The spaghetti with tomato and basil seems simple but delicious, a must-try!  This restaurant is in a great spot with nice window views of the Bellagio Fountain ,  Hip and Happening for a Upscale Trattoria and based on how packed it  has hit the ground running on the Strip.

Wow this place is bananas.  And as you all know bananas are good!  Some really creative and delicious burgers.  This place blows the Burger Bar inside Mandalay out of the water and doesn't leave a hole in your wallet .  Those donuts they have, OMFG I think they put crack cocaine in them.  They are so addicting.    Added bonus it's close by the office.  Kiki Burger, sauteed shitaki mushrooms.  That is my recommendation and I added some Thai Chili Paste for that extra heat.

They do take their sweet ass time making these burgers.  I would at least block out an hour if your going here even for a party of three.  Yes...they are friendly.    The menu is creative but when it gets busy....it gets real busy and their service level goes out the window.  Look forward to checking out their other location next time.

For the top mix of locals and tourists action in the middle of the strip specifically...no question this is my second favorite poker room for competition and comfort.  I have never had a bad experience with any dealer mishaps *knock on wood*.....the floor people are fair and efficient on any rulings.  2/5 No Limit is bottom of the barrel to getting a table BUT the pot$ are still quite profitable!    I personally don't booze when I'm playing...gotta keep all my "faculties" sharp...but even at 2am my server still took 20 mins for a bottle of water....ugh!    I have yet to play a daily tournament here just due to timing and questionable blind structures on the events I was interested in.  If I could be a fly on the wall inside Bobby's room and see Phil Ivey on the felt that would be unbelievable!   3 stars for the service.  5 stars for the management and promotions.

Had my best sessions playing 2/5 and 5/10 NL back in 2010.  Comfortable seats and mostly friendly dealers.  Tons of fish roaming during really busy convention weekends that usually have few hundred bucks to blow.  The drunk players coming upstairs from TAO are the easy targets.  Added bonus is they offer Fiji bottled water.

On my first visit to the Monta (Ellis) Noodle House I had an inclination that it was worthy of four sexy stars. After eating here, I'm quite certain of that.  Your not going to drive past it on Spring Mountain in case you think you missed it because it's all the way in the back of the plaza.    If your a Rameniac like myself.  This place is the new kid on the block and a must-try.  We know Las Vegas isn't exactly a hot-bed for ramen but Monta meets my needs.  The Miso Ramen was delicious, it's probably one of the best in town. we waited 15 minutes, but definitely worth the wait. although many have first timers have said it wasn't worth.  Monta wouldn't stand a chance vs. some ramen spots I frequent in the Bay Area. But all of my friends and they were all asian said it couldn't be better.  The kikurage was yummy as well.  But stay away from the specials like the Kim-Chi Fried Rice.  But who the hell goes to a ramen house for fried rice?  Duh!

Fuk U!  Exactly!  Because that's my reaction after my first bite of this delectable greasy morsel of deliciousness.  The burger had a teriyaki sweetness to it.  I would classify it as a "tweener" burger not even a normal-size burger.  With that said, I'm getting half a bang for my buck but that's why you pay for hamburger meat that's grinded fresh everyday.    With my last bite about to be devoured....the echo of me yelling NOOOOOOOO in slow motion because I unfortunately made the HUGE mistake of eating my Tamago Burger standing up as the runny egg yolk was dripping down on my new pairs of kicks!  Grrrrrr!!!    Anyhoo....creative menu with an occasional special and it just works.  So keep it going Mr. Colin Fuku and the crew.  Pick up your FukUBurger up in Chinatown next to BofA for now.  Otherwise if you don't than your Fuk'd!

I had an awesome company lunch at this recently opened spot which used to be Fadó Irish Pub.  Republic Kitchen is conveniently located right in the same strip mall as BJ's Brewhouse.    I ordered the 1/2 pound burger which was perfectly cooked medium and with thick cut applewood smoked bacon on this nice fresh baked soft pretzelly type bun.  I'm sure glad I got those balsamic glazed onions on the side because they really overpower the taste of the burger.  But I could've eaten a plate by themselves!  The next on my lunch list to try is that Lobster Pot Pie.  Holy schnikes that sounds legit and can't wait to come back for happy hour!

Normally on the weekends I wouldn't schlep all the way to Henderson for my Vietnamese/Pho fix unless I'm going there during the week from the office.    But on a lazy Saturday afternoon, I was extended an invitation for the official official grand opening of Pho MaiLan with 20% off the meal.  Noodle Houses are not known for ambiance but based on first impression upon arrival, the vibe inside has a fun and relaxing interior.  Me and Mr. UK David C. ordered the Large Bun Bo MaiLan (their version of Bun Bo Hue) AKA (MaiLan spicy beef and pork noodle soup). By default, MaiLan doesn't have the congealed pig blood like a traditional BBH, but I actually prefer it without it. They loaded my bowl with a decent portion of protein which I always appreciate when I eat a bowl of noodle soup.  I put in my veggies (a sprinkling of bean sprouts and they have banana blossoms which I'm sure you won't find in many shop in the US, let alone Vegas).  A nice squeeze of some lime in my eye and in the soup of course.    Hell, I even managed to forget the sting of lime juice burning my eyeball for several minutes while I devoured my bowl of deliciousness.  The broth was nice with the right amount of spiciness that is enjoyable and very flavorful. You can really tell that they use good quality ingredients and prepare everything very well.  For a busy grand opening, the service was consistent and attentive to our needs and I never had to ask them to refill my glass of water.  I will have to try the Pho Dac Biet (Combination Special) and Cha Gio (Crispy Spring Rolls) next time to really round out this review.  We may have a potential new contender for favorite Bun Bo Hue but certainly room for improvement for a future UYE or lunch visit.  It will mos def be in the my lunch rotation going forward pho shizzle!

The service stinks.  That's putting it politely because every time they fucked up our order they never apologized and their lack of communication is worst.  Maybe I just get the bad server but the managers are just as unprofessional.  The to go line during their happy hour for milkshakes is so disorganized I have no confidence they ever get my order right.    These Burgers suck and are just nothing special at all.  The meat may not be frozen but that steak seasoning doesn't do anything for me.  It sucks!  The fries aren't fresh cut and they suck.  The only thing that didn't suck was the milkshake and they couldn't even get that right on the first order.  THREE TIMES I've ordered a milkshake here they've fucked it up.  I'm NEVER going back to this particular SnS again.

I found Dr. Stark's practice from Demandforce which allows me to confirm my appointments with the front office via email and text messaging.  So, that made my decision much easier knowing they embraced online patient communications.    I called and managed the scheduling with Nancy.  She is just awesome and has a great sense of humor.  At the time it was the end of the year and my insurance was about to expire.  So, it was going to be rough to get scheduled.  But Nancy was so helpful and persistent by doing everything she could get me in for my scaling and root planning with one week left in the month since I needed to set up two separate  2 hour appointments due to length of the treatment.   Gina who is no longer there was an awesome hygienist and made me feel comfortable.  Dr. Stark answered all my questions even though another practice offered a Zoom teeth whitening deal from Groupon she matched the offer and did a great job with the treatment.  No question I would recommend Dr. Stark and their staff for your dental needs and they do Invisalign also.      The very clean and modern office is right on the corner of Charleston and Ft. Apache.

OK let's start with the one positive....yes they do bake their own banh mi so a fresh baked viet baguette which is always a plus in my book.  I observed that they make their sandwiches like that cheap ass frugal "subway style".  2 slices of head cheese and 2 slices of cha lua.  Little filla and NO thrilla!  So if you have a small appetite than it's perfect for you.  If your looking for a hearty banh mi....Mekong ain't going to cut the mustard or should I say pâté which they also charge for an extra shmear.  Right of course they do!    They charge extra for even a few extra slivers of pickled carrots and daikon!  WTH is there is there like a shortage in AZ or something!  I have never ever been charged for extra pickled veggies on my banh mi ever!!!!!     Overall it's a mediocre sandwich.  Given the limited options for banh mi in AZ.  It should take care of your bm fix and I'd return to try their bánh bao ONLY and the pate chaud ONLY when I'm back in the desert.
