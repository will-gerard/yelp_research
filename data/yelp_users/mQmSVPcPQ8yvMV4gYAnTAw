We ordered take out from Dragon Palace last night. My hubby went to pick it up on his way home from work and it was ready on time. Since this was our first time, we opted for the Mandarin Dinner for 2 so we could try a few things. I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food because it tends to be too greasy and salty for me; however, this was Seriously SO delicious! We were pleasantly surprised to see the take out containers packed full. The Mandarin Dinner comes with 2 Egg Rolls and 2 Pork wontons (greasy but that's kind of just how they are - the taste was good tho), Wor Wonton Soup (so delicious) with fried crispies on the side, Mongolian Beef, Sweet and Sour Pork, Pork Fried Rice, 2 Fortune Cookies and 2 Almond Cookies---all for $30! What a great deal! Let's just say we have leftovers for lunch (plus some) today.    I'd never had Wor Wonton Soup before and this was packed full of chicken, shrimp, pork, veggies all in a clear broth and it was so flavorful! I normally add soy sauce (actually I use liquid aminos) but that would have made it too salty. It was perfect just the way it was prepared! This was my favorite dish and definitely ordering that again.  My husband loved the Mongolian Beef - just all beef and green onions in a yummy brown sauce. Lots of beef!!  The Sweet and Sour pork was perfect! Sometimes I order S&S and there's overkill of too many onions, peppers, and pineapple, but not this one! They really focus on delivering you the pork! The only change is next time I'll probably request the sweet and sour sauce on the side because by the time we got it home the pieces in the middle and bottom started getting a little soggy.  The Pork Fried Rice is packed with pork, veggies and eggs. We were very impressed. So yummy!  We will definitely be coming back! :)

We went to La Hacienda last night for dinner - it came highly recommended by a friend of ours who works at The Princess (thank you Sarah!). We were a little uncertain since it seemed a little pricey for Mexican food (there's a Mexican food restaurant on just about every corner in AZ), but since we are staying at the resort, we decided to try it. We are so happy we did! If you come here, get something worth trying that you won't find on other menus (don't get your standard tacos, fajitas, or enchiladas). Our server was very helpful and offered excellent suggestions.  We started with the Pepitas Guacamole - not your typical guac. They add veggies, pepitas, and other ingredients to make it extra delicious and different. The salsa that comes with it was amazing too!  For entrees we shared a steak dish, Tampiquena, as well as the Carnitas. Although Carnitas is something you can find in many places, this one was fantastic. Our server highly recc as his favorite dish :) Our favorite was the Tampiquena steak. The Tampiquena comes with a cheese enchilada covered in mole sauce. I'm not a fan of Mole sauce, but my fiancé absolutely loved it. The sauce was only on the cheese enchilada so it didn't alter the deliciousness of the steak for me. I also loved the Habanero Slaw that came with the Carnitas. Yumm!!  I guess our entrees took longer than the chef wanted so he gave us a complimentary dessert - Tres Leches cake! We didn't actually notice the wait, but appreciated the kind gesture. We were stuffed so we took it to go and ate it for breakfast :)   Drinks: we had been drinking by the pool all day so we just went with cervezas. I had a Tecate, Michelada style, and it was perfect! My fiancé had a Negro Modelo.   Overall, great ambiance and prices weren't bad for a restaurant at a five-star resort. We enjoyed everything so much we would definitely recommend it.

I used to come here often and was happy, but the last few times I've been VERY unhappy. My $30 gel manicure too her about 15-20 minutes. The gel was slopped on, my cuticles were given barely attention, and the gel polish started chipping the next day! We went on a day where there's an advertised special that if you pay in cash you get an extra 15% off...well they give you a discount if you get a mani and pedi, but they don't give you the cash discount. They argued with us for 10 minutes. It was so unprofessional and extremely uncomfortable. There were even other customers in the salon. I will not be going back. Very upsetting.

I went here for dinner last night and order take out. The tacos were so delicious! After reading the reviews I decided to try the Fish and Carne Asada tacos. Then I asked the girl at the register to suggest a third so I ordered the Adobado. All three were delicious but I ordered WAY too much food. I think on a normal night 1 1/2 would be plenty. I couldn't eat it all. My favorite was the Fish Taco, and the Carne Asada Taco was a very close second. I didn't try the rice, beans, or chips. The salsa bar is clean. The bar was out of one salsa I wanted to try so I asked for more and they happily (and quickly) brought out another batch. The salsas were all cold and tasted fresh. The people there are so friendly. I would definitely recommend Gordas Baja Taco :)

I've been to two other GYNs in the past year and just didn't feel comfortable with either. My normal GYN (10+ yrs) had made some serious medical errors with my friend and it was more than enough to cause me to look elsewhere.   After finding Maricopa OBGYN on Yelp, I called to schedule a new patient appt. It was difficult to get in immediately since I wasn't pregnant or having any medical issues - just a pre-natal consult. I asked for their best OBGYN, and the admin was confidently unbiased. She sounded like she truly felt all of their doctors are great! I was put on the waitlist. I was concerned with appointment availability if a serious issue was presenting itself, but was quickly relieved when the scheduler said that if it was something requiring attention or related to pregnancy, that they would get me in right away. Because my appointment wasn't related to an immediate need, I accepted the waitlist option and they called after only a few days with an opening. From first call to appointment date was about 1 week.   I met with Dr Mayer for the first time today. She is wonderful, personable and takes the time to make sure all questions are answered. I felt extremely comfortable with her. I felt like she really cared about my questions and immediately felt a sense of trust with her. I highly recommend her.   Location: The entrance is on the first floor of the atrium on the north side, closest to the large fountains.

Ling was referred to me by a friend and she is absolutely fantastic. Ling's eye for fashion-forward trends and brilliant use of color leaves little for any skeptic to criticize. The salon is conveniently located, clean, and Ling offers a healthy variety of services. She is competitively priced and only uses the best of the best in professional products. To top it off, Ling's witty, fresh, professional personality make your time there a delight. I highly recommend her. :)

I bought a living social deal so my bf and I decided to come for dinner...what we didn't realize was that it was restaurant week. The deal included 2 margaritas so we started with those. They were good, but nothing special. The waiter said they were made with a standard mix, not a freshly made mix. We also asked for chips and salsa. Well that's not on the restaurant week menu so we were told we couldn't order it. Our living social deal was for 2 Margs and 2 entrees. We decided to order chips and guacamole since THAT was on the menu. I asked for a side of salsa...no salsa bc it's not on the menu. WHAT?? Seriously! We are at a Mexican food restaurant. No salsa??! Even the table next to us was annoyed at that. Ok. Moving on, our food came and it was pretty good. We ordered the chicken enchilada and a pork adobo. We were happy with the flavor, but it was super small. The enchilada came by itself on a plate - just one. It was in a typical taco size tortilla, like the size you'd buy at store (but fresh and the tortillas there are definitely delicious). The pork was good. I didn't care much for the sauce, but my bf enjoyed it. The decor was also kinda weird. Mexican food restaurant and the chandeliers were made of wooden clothes pins and painter red, white and blue...that's odd to me. Honestly though, the food lost its glory bc of the absolutely HORRIBLE service. The manager came by and he was really friendly, but our regular server really stunk. Service is almost as important as the food - and they can both, just as easily as the other, leave a bad taste in your mouth. I'm going back to Cien Agaves. Better food, fantastic service, awesome margaritas, and more reasonable prices.

Katie is amazing! I love SNS nail polish. No UV lights, no drills, and it comes off completely by just soaking in acetone for 15 minutes. She doesn't have to scrape or peel away my natural nail to remove it. My nails are always in great shape when she takes it off. Thank you!!
