Five stars for the breakfast skillets. The one with bacon/sausage/eggs is delicious and the best of its kind that I've had anywhere.  The place is in one of the oldest buildings in downtown Gilbert, with adobe walls that lean 5-10 degrees but have not fallen down.

This place is actually a cafe with a good selection of breakfast and lunch sandwiches (really good) and breakfast burritos (huge but I haven't tried them yet). Pretty fun atmosphere and fast Wi-Fi so I usually sit down and work a couple hours.  Minus one star for the plague of flies in that area. There are often 3-4 aggressive flies buzzing around the place. If they could get rid of the flies somehow (lasers perhaps) it would be a favorite place of mine.

I thought it was about time I did a 2-star review so I picked this place. I used to go to Paradise Bakery all the time (Wi-Fi being the main reason) but the past year or so it's gone way downhill. Worse quality food, bad service, etc. I had the same experience at Panera in California.
