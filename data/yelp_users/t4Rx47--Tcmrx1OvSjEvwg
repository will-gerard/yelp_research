Great food, authentic atmosphere, friendly staff: this place has it all. Probably about 12 different margaritas varieties, I simply cannot express how much i enjoyed this restaurant. We just moved here from California (My gf and I) and I have found my new Mexican place! ;-)

Do not get a membership at this gym!  You've been warned.  The staff never shows up during their own scheduled office hours during the week so if you ever have any concerns or need to change your billing info etc... they're never there to help.  After new year everyone is gym crazy and wants to workout as much as possible, right? That was me. The 2nd week of this new year the gym shut down for an entire week due to "weather damage". No email was sent out or anything, just a sign on the door. Any reputable gym would have given notice or offered some type of rebate on your membership. Nothing.  None of the dumbells are labeled with their appropriate weights (so it's a guessing game every time), the cardio machines are all jokingly outdated, it's always really hot inside, and they must not clean much because it always smells like BO.  I signed a year contract unfortunately, but I'm done after that. What a crap gym... Never again.

Went to grab a Burger at the bar and watch the FSU game during my lunch break. Sat for 10 minutes while the bar tender completely ignored me and talked to her friends at the bar. Didn't even get a water... Got up and walked out.
