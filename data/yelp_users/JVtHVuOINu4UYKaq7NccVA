Awesome modest little restaurant with super service from the owner. I had the Queen Arepa, the pork empanada and the Equadorian tamale. All the food was fantastic. I am definitely going to be ordering some tamales and empanadas for the holidays.

Perfect place for lunch. It's a hole in a small plaza shared with a convenience store and some dive bar. But man, it's legit. Nice and clean place with cooks that are clean and the woman behind the register was very nice. The food was outstanding.

I thought I had doughnuts before. These things put everything I've ever had to shame. They are big and very tasty.

This place is mediocre at best. We were enticed by the looks of the place, but left severely disappointed.  Positives: 1) the Ambiance is very nice. 2) the hostess was very friendly. 3) the waiter was also very friendly. 4) the assorted bread basket was very good (my wife quipped "they must get it from somewhere else") 5) The French Onion soup was descent. Not the best I've had, but certainly not the worst, and had we left it at that, I probably wouldn't be writing this review.   But alas, then came the rest:  Negatives: 1) the Bloody Mary was nothing more than bland canned tomato juice, vodka, Tabasco, a couple olives and a dash of black pepper. No self-respecting bartender would ever try to pass this bright red concoction off as a Bloody Mary.  I snagged some Worcestershire sauce and raw horseradish from the waiter to attempt a rescue. There was no lime, no celery, no zing to the "mix". We've had better on airplanes that use Mr and Mrs T's spicy bloody mary mix. This was an absolute joke for something that should be a no-brainer.   2) the Makers Mark Manhattan was heavy on the bitters and maraschino. Not so good, but at least not as bad as the bloody.  3) my wife's Crab Cakes tasted so-so flavor wise but they were soggy, mushy and dense. Sadly, the texture turned them more into Crap Cakes than Crab Cakes.  4) now for the biggest joke: I wasn't super hungry so I ordered the Kansas Chopped Salad adding the optional "tenderloin tips" and blue cheese dressing.  The menu description says: "Seasonal greens tossed with smoked cheddar, avocado, other market fresh ingredients and your choice of dressing." I was thinking that I'd get something approaching the Steak Salad available at your local YardHouse restaurant minus the pickled egg and not as big.  What I actually got was Iceberg lettuce (which I can't stand and definitely is not "seasonal mixed greens"), smoked cheddar (which was good), a single slice of avocado (that I had to hunt for profusely because I was about to send it back for not having it), blue cheese dressing (which was good). The Tenderloin Tips? Let's just say it was pretty close to the meat you find in a frozen Steak-uum sandwich. It was so sub-par.  Perhaps some of their other dishes are executed better, but this was what I would expect from a McDonalds salad.

It's not horrible, but it's just not that great. Honestly, you'll get better flavor at Federico's.

I had the Yuca con Chicharr√≥n, a bean cheese and pork pupusa, and finished it off with the banana empanadas. Everything was fantastic, and the horchata was authentic Salvadoran, made with (I believe) morro seeds, and was also very tasty. Our server was very friendly and the restaurant had a nice feel to it--they even had soccer on for me. Will be going back for sure.

Another great visit here. Love the food and the service is great. Had the banana empanadas and the huevos rancheros. So good and I love their horchata.
