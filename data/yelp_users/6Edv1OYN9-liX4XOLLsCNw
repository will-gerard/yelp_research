Normally I would rate this at a 3 or 4 the barsitas are friendly warm and inviting. Typically they are pretty busy and seem understaffed. But I went to go get my coffee. I arrived at 430 to get my coffee when they opened but I sat there until 508 and they still had not opened. The barsitas where there but sticking items while people waited outside. I won't be going here again...

Went in with low expectations cause of the reviews but a few made me believe there was hope. I sat down and was promptly greeted by my waiter, Brian. He was friendly and offered a few good suggestions on what to eat. I ended up ordering the clam chowder which was really good. All in all it surpassed my expectations.
