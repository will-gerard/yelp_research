I've been going to D'lish for years! It's a great local spot that serves on the go healthy food. It's best known for their Breakfast Buzz morning smoothie with espresso, peanut butter and chocolate. I usually get their traditional burrito or Oatmeal their way made with quinoa! All their items are listed gluten free or vegan for customers who have diet limitations!

Worst service I've ever had. Paid for $100 car wash, an hour and a half later came back and they forgot about my car. Then had to argue 30 minutes for a full refund. On top of it all I love with a dirty car. Never going back.

We went in for dinner last night excited to try something new in old town. Should've known when we walked in to an empty restaurant what we were in for. But decided to sit down anyways, then saw Chef Eddie himself so figured it had to be good. He left by the time we placed our order. Service was slow. They brought out the wrong food to my date so he sent it back and my food was cold so after a couple of bites I sent it back too. They reheated the same steak with my bites still in it. Mashed potatoes tasted old and lacked flavor. Waste of $100 for dinner. Didn't comp anything for bad service even after we vocalized. Save your money, you can get better food at a hamburger joint.

A must stop every time I'm near by! I get the Americanos or cappuccino. Bold coffee with a rich taste!

Worth every dollar... Amazing ambiance, amazing service, amazing food!!!! New favorite steak house in Arizona. I got the filet, Brussel sprouts and lobster whipped potatoes. I was too full, but the dessert looked amazing. The table next to us got a tree full of beignets.

I started seeing Nancy Jorgensen as a nurse practitioner who I loved for my annual exam; however, today the Front Desk staff and medical assistant performed extremely below my expectations. I went in for a urine sample because I was having UTI symptoms. They said  I could come in and just give a urine sample at lunch. The favor I thought they were doing was a disservice. After an afternoon of fever and sharp side pains, I called 3 times looking for a prescription before I finally talked to the Medical Assistant who said my urine was sent off without her knowing, the NP went home, and the doctor couldn't speak to anyone so I couldn't get a prescription for 48 hours. Now I'm heading to an urgent care with a pricey copay. Poor care for a medical office.
