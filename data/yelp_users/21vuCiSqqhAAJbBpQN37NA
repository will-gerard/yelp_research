Went in after Bar Rescue. I thought the changes were great! In the past the service wasn't very good and on our trip the servers were really attentive and very knowledgeable. I had always thought that the food was okay for bar food, but really loved the new streamlined menu and tried their fish fry. The servings were enormous and a great deal. My husband had the pasty which was the same as before. Overall a great neighborhood pub.

I love Matt Pool's restaurants, so I keep going back to Giant in hopes that it won't disappoint.  The food is amazing, the coffee is great, and the atmosphere is everything you are looking for...BUT the service is terrible.  I have gone three times, each time the service is awful.  The first time it was just slow, no big deal, it was the girls second day.  The second time I was ignored for 10 minutes, then the girl forgot my drink order (It was coffee with soy milk).  Then this weekend I tried it again.  It was stormy outside and the perfect day to sip coffee, eat breakfast, and shop at Bunky's.  I ordered a coffee (black this time) and the baked eggs with toast WITHOUT PROSCIUTTO.  I paid the $8 for eggs and toast without complaint since I was the person being difficult.  It took 15 minutes to get my coffee (remember its just plain drip coffee), no big deal, I can wait. Then another 20 minutes after I received my coffee the guy comes by with my eggs and toast, covered in prosciutto.  He asks if this is my order and I tell him I ordered it without the meat.  He says, "oh, then I will bring you a side plate." I tell him that isn't what I want, and that I don't eat meat.  To this he responds with indignation, "what are you allergic?" I tell him no I am a vegetarian.  He then says, "ok well I will go just pick it off."  At that point I get a refund and call in an order to Matt's Big Breakfast for pick up.  It was only a 15 minute wait, was without meat, and was served with a smile.  Hoping that someone reads this and give the staff some much needed customer service training.  Matt is a talented chef and restaurateur hoping that this problem is fixed.    On a nice side note the outdoor seating is dog friendly.

Great drink prices! I  especially enjoyed the $4 basil mojito which is their all day Monday drink special. $5 house red and white wines all the time. I have been there a few times recently with friends and sharing a pizza and a mini mac is the perfect amount of food!

Loved this place! Went for my husband's birthday and had the burrata, red bean soup, short ribs and scallops (special). It was all delicious and had great service. Corinna was great.

Just tried this place for the first time and enjoyed it! I had the tofu red curry and my husband had the spicy fried rice. Overall a great new place!
