I'm rating this of my initial experience with this place and my disappointment. I had been wanting to check out this place as I had been hearing great things about the wine and cheese selections plus I drive by  there everyday.   My friend and I chose to check it out on a mellow weekday afternoon and we did not even eat/drink here because of the initial impression we received. We walked into the front entry and saw there was only one couple at a table and it was slow due to the time of day. We looked around and eventually expected to see anyone who worked there as we awkwardly waited near the hostess stand for several minutes. Finally, a server emerged who did not even acknowledge us in any way and went to help the one table. After that it appeared that a cook or someone from back of house came out to the bar and again did not acknowledge us either. Finally, a couple minutes later the waiter came out into the dining room again and we asked to see a wine list just to get his attention. He then made his way over to hand us a wine list. At that point, we were pretty much over this place as we did not want to see how much worse the service might get if we actually stayed. I was really disappointed that the experience was so bad without even trying the place as I was really looking forward to finding a new downtown restaurant.

I absolutely LOVE having pizza and a caesar salad on the patio with a fab glass of wine here. By far, my most favorite pizza is with prosciutto and arugula, but the margherita is wonderful as well. I don't even like to tell people about this place because it is one of my favorite, not super-popular places so it is not very busy when we go. : ) It is very casual and laid back plus the staff is knowledgeable and the wine selection is superb.

We had sandwiches for lunch which were huge and tasty. Wish they served beer/wine, but still a great spot to sit on a beautiful patio and enjoy the great food and service from this hidden gem.

I have not actually eaten in the restaurant, but have had delivery several times and it is definitely the best quick, Chinese delivery I have ever had. Each time I have the potstickers for app which is a great start. My favorite is the shrimp in lobster sauce and the portions are massive! I can make this into about 3 meals as a result and the egg flower soup is also very tasty and the small is like a large. They are very quick and the delivery boy is always friendly as is the person who takes the order when I call in. Best Chinese delivery in the West Valley for sure!

I have been to Corbin's twice now and have plans to go back in the future. It is everything that I look for in a restaurant/bar in that the staff is professional, the atmosphere is comfortable/chic, and the prices are reasonable. The first time we sat on the patio a couple months ago with amazing service along with the manager/owner? stopping by to see how everything was. During a recent visit on Sunday, the restaurant was not very busy when we arrived, but the entire place filled up during the time we were there. Our bartender was helpful in giving recommendations, made a great apple martini, and had a great personality. We had the ahi tuna app, which was a great snack with drinks. I would definitely recommend Corbin's as it's a great place to relax to have a couple drinks and/or dinner.

One word for this place, AMAZING, and I think I just found my new favorite restaurant. We arrived early for our reservation as we wanted to have drinks at the bar. We were greeted by the warm, friendly hostess who offered us a seat on the patio until a table opened up. The bartender got our drinks quickly even though the bar was completely full. We sat on the beautiful patio enjoying our drinks until our table was ready.   Table service was fantastic as well and I ordered the halibut with couscous while my husband ordered the steak. The halibut was huge and cooked perfectly with a fabulous combination of flavors. The steak was very tender and juicy with a flavorful sauce. Also, the prices are very reasonable for what you get as our entrees were $23-$24 and they were pretty much the most expensive menu items. I would normally expect to pay much more for the type of food and level of service received.  St. Francis has it figured out with impressive customer service, an unbelievable menu, and relaxing ambiance. No wonder this place is packed all the time.

My hubby and I love Yard House especially for their late night happy hour. It's super-chill and a fun place to hang out for a couple hours. Their menu is massive and have yet to have something that we don't like. Especially love the ahi tuna app as well as the pizzas (margherita and pineapple/ham). Last time we were in my husband could not remember which Amber beer he had the last time we were there. The server made it his mission to find out which one it was making several trips to the taps and listing off names and styles until he found which one it was which was impressive. The servers and bartenders have genuine personalities, but are not overbearing. I also like the semi-open kitchen where you can see back of house staff working. Yard House is one of my favorite go-to places to grab a beer/wine and a tasty little snack.

reBAR is a great hang out to have a few drinks and enjoy the beautiful patio. The sweet potato chips are a fabulous little snack and the service is always outstanding.

I contacted Phoenix Towing a few months ago when I managed to kill the battery and I also didn't have a key (just the clicker) to unlock the door. As a result, I needed a jump and I was locked out. I was in South Phoenix at the time after work and the guy who was on call arrived in about 45 minutes which was reasonable considering he was coming from North Phoenix during rush hour. I believe Mark was his name and he was super friendly and helpful in making sure I was able to get everything running again for a decent price. He also followed up shortly after I left to make sure everything was okay and that I wasn't having any additional issues. I have kept his card and I will definitely be calling them for any other car issues I have in the future.
