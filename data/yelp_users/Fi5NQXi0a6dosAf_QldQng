I'm a huge brewery girl, and in Phoenix new ones seem to be popping up right and left. However, if you are in the downtown area, look no farther than this place - I'm shocked that their rating is lower than Phoenix Ale Brewery (next closest to downtown) because everything here is mearsureably better IMO.   First thing, SunUp has a deal on Restaurant.com right now and so I took advantage of that today and a coworker and I went up there to grab lunch. I love the feel of the bar area with the exposed brick and wooden stools, its warm and welcoming but also feels like a cool joint. My coworker had never been but she too was immediatly impressed.   Our waitress was nice and attentive, bringing out our drinks and taking our orders timely. She also noticed our $15 GC on the table and went ahead and took that off the bill for us witout us having to mention it. When we mentioned we were on our lunch hour, she made sure to keep our glasses full and get out food out fast, and even with the place filling up quickly she was on top of it and got us cashed out in a hurry.   The food was really good - especially for brewery/bar fare. I went with the chicken ceasar wrap and my coworker went with the green chili dip. Both were great, and reasonablly priced. I had a great lunch here and will definately be back soon.

Two words for you- caramel wings. They are the best wings I've ever had, and I'm one of those girls who doesn't eat wings in public, but one whiff of the Caramel garlic goodness and I inhaled half my friend's order. Love. Also, Moto sports a rockin beer lineup which is almost unheard of in a sushi joint-they have happy hour every day of the week! The sushi was good, I'm a huge fan of the bowls myself. And every single time I've been there (a dozen? More?) I've had stellar service. Super awesome staff, lovely ambience, awesome food and beer!! Go to moto, you will love it!

After hearing about this place from a few coworkers, my friend and I decided to go grab some subs for lunch today. How did i survive so long on my crappy work cafeteria food when this was 2 mins away???  Its great, its a hidden little spot right off of 24th street with amazingly fresh food and speedy service. Not only that, but the cost is super cheap! The mini subs are in the 3 dollar range and are perfect for lunch. We will be back...many, many times.

Went in today to ship a package out using Ground shipping. As soon as I walked in the door, I was greeted by a friendly woman however when I approached the counter the man behind it just stared at the box I was holding. I asked if I could set it down and he just nodded, didn't point to a place or greet me at all and he just kept staring at the box. Realizing I packed it upside down, I made a joke about that, figuring that was the problem. He just nodded and then slid the box closer to him so he could examine the label, I told them both that the label was old and I forgot to remove it, so I'll need a new one. At this point the man is giving me the creeps so I asked him if there was a problem. This is when he tells me, wait for it....Well this is the same box we receive our supplies in, so I'm kinda wondering if you stole it from the dumpster out back. I couldn't believe this - because I'm using a FedEx box I must have dived in your dumpster? I said that was a really weird thing to say and looked around at the other two workers who seemed unfazed. He still made no attempt to help me - so I said I was really uncomfortable and would be taking my business elsewhere. He didn't apologize, try to explain or clarify - I took my box and walked out. I've never in my life been treated this way even at the post office during Christmas! Unbelievable. DO NOT go to this location.

One of the many little gems in the east valley- I totally agree with everyone about the personality of the cute little older gentleman makin it more than an ordinary takeout experience. We ordered the chicken fried rice and the chicken terriaki- both were tasty. Wasn't expecting the chicken to be fried in the fried rice, but it tasted great. I will be back again soon, it's nice to get great food and service with a smile :)

I work downtown and this is a convenient spot to hit for lunch or happy hour. But, I've never liked my experiences here and maybe I just have higher standards but I'd rather go to any number of places for lunch or happy hour.   The issues start with the fact that Seamus is dirty, dusty, and has terrible food, warm beer and pretty terrible service. I just had lunch again here Friday and we had to wait over an hour for a couple salads and appetizers. It's honestly the worst.   The place hasn't been upgraded or had any money put into fixing it up in decades- it's just subpar in every way. And every time I see dirt or dust and have to use their rundown bathrooms I can't help but think - if this is how they maintain the areas customers see, what about the place my food is prepared?

Well I came here with coworkers for lunch today and i must say, the experience left a lot to be desired.   The place seems kinda dusty and dingy when you walk and there an unappetizing looking salad bar/condiment table that you line up next to when you place your order. I went with a bacon cheeseburger on wheat. The bun was just a grocery store bun, standard american cheese, a bland under seasoned and overlooked burger. The bacon was great, but that's honestly the only thing I liked here.   There are better places everywhere you turn with the trendy burger joints popping up a lot in the valley. The fries, which I didn't order but my coworkers did, appeared to be frozen. I just hope for more- get fresh ingredients- make your fries- season the burger. Pass on this place and take your hard earned cash elsewhere.

My friends and I stopped in to Four Peaks for dinner Saturday night after attending an event at a much-less appealing food-wise beer bar. I'm so happy we did - I'd honestly forgotten just how much I love this place. Granted, school is out so we are able to park reasonably close and actually get seated right away - however even if we didnt, i'm sure we still would have had a great experience. Our waitress was just wonderful, she was so friendly and attentive. We had all the seasonal beers - the Red, the Saison and the amazing Short Hop and Double Knot. I really wish Double Knot was available in stores, that is one amazing brew. Our food was equally delicous - we actually tried the new calamari app and were in LOVE. We'd all been to San Diego together last year and honestly the dish was prepared so well it reminded us of the calamari we had right on the beach in SD. Really great - we also had the Italian Beef, French Dip (Prime/Irish) and the Salmon BLT. Everyone loved their meals and of course the beer-battered fries that accompany them are excellent as always. This is a brewery that is run like a restaurant but with amazing beer - really a great place and its no wonder there are now 4 locations in the Valley.

Pita Jungle is a go-to in the area for fast, fresh, delicous options for lunch. I know they have dinner too but I love the lunches here -they get you in, fed, and out the door in under an hour without fail.   Never had a bad meal, did the Falafel salad today and it was divine. They serve it with pita bread too so if you were craving a pita wrap, you can make one from your salad plate! The sandwiches are great, the salmon was wonderful the last time I was here.   All in all, this place cant be beat. The location is a little hard to get to being on the light rail route, but its worth it to get your fix. I always leave full and happy, but not too light in the wallet :)

I'm a Rays fan from Tampa and let me just tell you, coming from the WORST stadium in the game, this place is like paradise! I love baseball and this year am lucky enough to have a friend that enjoys it as much as I and we purchased a mini-season ticket package.   So far I've been to 4 games this year and love this place. I mostly sit in the Club Level and really enjoy the view there but also it is much less crowded (no bathroom lines, ladies!) but also features the Draft Room. I believe this was a new addition to the stadium last year and features about 20 taps of delicious craft beer spotlighting local craft but also yummy national (AB Inbev) taps as well such as Elysian and 10 Barrel.   The stadium is nothing short of majestic when the roof is open and the sun is setting on a lovely nighttime ballgame. Truly breathtaking and then we often get free fireworks if it happens to be a Friday game. Such a great team with awesome giveaways, affordable concessions, and an overall amazing ballpark experience!

Before making a Saturday trip to Home Depot, my mom and I decided to grab a quick early breakfast here. This spot is located just minutes from our houses and I've been eyeing it ever since I bought my place last year.   They have ample seating both inside and out and of course plenty of parking since the Café is located right next to Zipps in that strip mall on Indian School. I thought this was a sit-down restaurant, but its actually a counter-order place which worked out great. The prices are nice and the portions were generous. Mom went for the bacon and cheese omellete with hash browns and cottage cheese and I gave into my sweet tooth with the French toast which was amazing. I also got a Mocha to go with my meal and I really enjoyed their coffee there as well, decently priced there too. The food came out quickly, was freshly made and delicious. What more could you want from a neighborhood breakfast joint? We'll be back for sure.

Fibbers is within walking distance of our new place and I've been taking advantage lately- you can't go wrong with the happy hour here. Seriously, half price all apps? Sold- and it's great food! Beer is good, pricey though so not the best but the food and ambiance will keep us coming back!

I live in Chandler, so the ONLY negative thing I can say is that this place needs to be a lot closer to me!   Had a great time here - I've seen them on Check Please! and have been wanting to eat here plus I knew about the amazing tap list from hearing from other beer nerds and was excited to try it out. This place does not disappoint. From coffee to gelato to wine and beer and great food - they have it all covered here! I tried a beer flight and loved getting to try some of the best taps around thanks to their awesome beer guy Ian. The food was really great too, I know my friends were all really happy with their selections as well. Next time I want to try some wines for wine night - it all looked really great!

My friend took me here for a birthday dinner and it was simply amazing- on par with my favorite The Mission out in Old Town Scottsdale. We shared several dishes and we really loved everything- including the delicious margaritas! The pomegranate one I had was simply one of the best I've ever had. I'm getting hungry just thinking about their amazing menu. Yummmerz!

If you like excellent food, great beer on tap and all on the cheap- this is it.   I love this place- I usually go with Lamb Vindaloo so I can get a little spice in my life and one of their amazing beers to wash it down. When that warm pocket of goodness arrives at your table, you know you made the right choice for your meal. You can even take one to go and finish cooking your pasty at home.   All in all, this is a go to for me and my friends and you won't be disappointed if you work this place into your rotation either!

Turns out, there are some chain restaurants I do like - and Jason's Deli sits atop that rather short but awesome list.   I've been in twice since my office moved to the Chandler area and its been a really pleasant experience. The folks that work there are some of the happiest people on Earth - asking if you've been in before, helping you through the menu and never making you feel rushed or unwelcome. The salad bar is awesome - full of fresh ingredients that the staff ensures remain filled at all times. There is also some mini muffins, crackers and free ice cream.   The food is great, comes out quickly and the price is right. I got a half sandwich and a trip to the salad bar for under 10 bucks, very happy with my lunch yesterday. I'll be back in again to sample some more of their menu and of course get some more of that awesome salad bar.

I've probably been to Hula's half a dozen times now and figured it was time to write up a rather glowing review. Never have had anything but great service here, the food has always been consistently amazing and they make some awesome house cocktails. I've come for happy hour quite a few times, and we even came here on NYE for their live music and all-night happy hour - what a fun crowd and a great time. Brunch on the weekends has always treated me great as well, I love their spin on a benedict. All in all, a solid go-to spot with a fun theme in downtown phoenix.

Stopped in Sleepy Dog after an awesome meal at Four Peaks down the road. The service, as usual, was excellent - the guy that waited on us is so nice and welcoming and didnt seem phased by the high number of tables that were all there for the Groupon deal. Though we didnt have one, that seems like a great idea to get people in the door and enjoying this place. I love the decor and the dog-theme here too. The beer is good, not great, but I like the blends that they offer that keep things interesting. I tried a Monte Azul/Wet Snout blend that was really tasty. All in all, we had an excellent time stopping in for a pint and will be back again.

Old Town is not short on the cocktail and wine bar options - from the very upscale to the comfortable tasting room. However, 5th and Wine now stands solidly atop the list for me. Here's why:   I came in for my first time ever with my best friend on her birthday on Saturday. The place is nicely decorated with a classy but not stuffy feel, nice cushy red chairs and a big marble bar that is very inviting. Naturally, that's where we ended up and then were informed of the Daily happy hour until 6pm. The menu is great, we took a picture and looked up the offerings in Vivino only to find that almost every offering was at least 3 stars with many 4 stars - and all on happy hour! Tried 2 different glasses and had some amazing snacks to go with it - the brie was the perfect pairing with our delish wine offerings. My Oregon Pinot was great, the pours were generous and overall we had an amazing time. The staff made sure we were attended to and never had an empty glass, and the price was right here.   Only suggestion would be that they embrace the Arizona wine scene, there were no local offerings at all on the wine list. However, I do know AZ wines may be a little pricey or harder to get, so that could be why. Other than that, we had the perfect time and can't wait to come back. We even snagged a groupon while we were there so we can come for Sunday Brunch soon!

My friends and I came here Friday night and I really enjoyed it! It's a cute little quaint place with an awesome beer selection and great sandwiches/salads.  When we arrived we found out that it's only $2.50 beers for happy hour which is amazing. 5 rotating taps and a ton more in cans/bottles. I went for a mozzarella and prosciutto sandwich with pesto and greens. Really good. My friends got the hot dog and the tuna salad on top of salad, they really enjoyed those as well.   Waitress was really on top of here game and i got out of there with beer and dinner for under 20 bucks on a Friday. Can't wait to come back for more!

Was really hopeful given the reviews, but the only thing I liked was my latte. The biscuits and gravy come with eggs on top and a side of grits. So basically a huge pile of brown food- appetizing? I think not. It just wasn't good, big miss for me.

Introduced my mom to yelp tonight and had her pick a spot for her birthday dinner- this is the spot she settled on.   While family style restaurants aren't really my thing, I will say that this place is a nice example of one. The place was nice and clean, we got a table right away and were greeted by a friendly waitress.   My mom went with an early bird special that included bread and a nice antipasto salad. There was also happy hour wine for only $3, you can't beat that even for well wines that's a great deal. Dinner came out quickly and was quite nice- very much like an Olive Garden type menu. They brought out a lovely apple bread pudding dessert for her as a birthday treat   If you want a family style affordable Italian place, you'll enjoy this restaurant.

I'm lucky enough to have a new job that is a 4 minute drive from here, I made the first of many lunch trips here today. I got a BBQ combo platter and it is seriously the best thing ever. I have tried other BBQ places in town and while they're good too, this is amazing! Juicy pork with tons of flavor, delectable chicken, and because I'm going all out for you, fellow yelpers, i upgraded to brisket for the 3rd option and its AMAZING.   I got the Mac n Cheese because well, we're going big here today, and the cole slaw. So much flavor, so tasty. I seriously love everything and the price isnt too bad, after all I have plenty for dinner here as well. It all comes with no sauce and then you can add whatever you like, I got a couple options to try out and, you guessed it, they are awesome too smokey sweet, tangy, spicy - whatever you like.   My only concern here is how big my obsession will grow...time to buy a gym membership for the sole purpose of eating here as often as possible! :)

After scouring Yelp reviews for a new nail place in my area in order to get a last minute mani/pedi before my vacation, I found this place. Great location in the plaza right by Wildflower bread and Nothing Bundt Cakes with ample parking - although the spots right in front are all "15 min Parking" spots, so beware of that.   Arrived for my appointment at 4:30pm and realized the place was empty - seems like a weekday in the afternoon would be a good time to stop in. The place did fill up by 5pm, but was never crowded and no one was asked to wait longer than 10 minutes or so as walk-ins which is nice.   Everyone was professional and the girl that was taking care of me was really nice and friendly but also focused and doing a great job. She gave me a pedi and then talked me into a quick mani as well (I have no nails, but needed some cuticle help) and I'm glad I went for both. Was done in under an hour and have a great looking pair of feet to show off in Cali this weekend. I'll be back for sure, only $40 for sugar, callus remover on the pedi plus a manicure. Great deal and good service. Try these guys out!

My third time to Beckett's Table was as lovely and memorable as my first, I seriously have this as a go-to for any celebration, special occassion, or just because place. On Sundays, they have 1/2 price AZ bottles of wine, and their selection is really great. Our waiter was awesome, we described our desired taste and he made a spot-on recommendation, and it wasn't the most expensive bottle (I'm looking at you, D-Vine).   Once again, my food was spectacular. Every time I've been has been with a different group with at least one person experiencing this place for the first time. I love everything from the warm ambience, the variety but clear direction of the menu, and the awesome staff and my friends and family agree. We've had everything from the salmon to the osso buco and from deviled eggs to cobbler and have enjoyed every bite. I seriously can't wait to go back. Love this place.

Flannys is a great neighborhood bar within walking distance of my place. They really do have some tasty choices on the menu - such as the very lemony hummus - but the real draw for me is the beer. They have these great events every Third Thursday where they have a tap takeover from an awesome brewery featuring specialty beers and they are always a favorite during Beer Week with the Firkin events. I wish the prices were a little cheaper, especially for the local beers that are on tap a few blocks away at the source for a fraction of the cost. But its really good service and a nice atmosphere, i recommend it - especially for their events!

Just moved to this neighboorhood and trying to navigate through the many asian takeout options and find one I'll be loyal to going forward. This isnt going to be the one for me.   I ordered take out online and the food was ready on time which was great. When i got home, I noticed that my yellow curry was looking kinda bland. the veggies included were undercooked and the rice on the side was actually completely crunchy and uncooked. Gross. I had an order of fried rice as well, so I ended up eating that and mixing in the chicken from the curry dish to make a big mixed dish. That was ok, so I never ended up complaining about the food to SaBai, but I must say that being able to cook rice should probably be something the restaurant has mastered by now - very disappointing. I think I'll try someplace else from now on.

Of the 3 Thai places within walking distance of my downtown office, this is clearly the standout. Thai Basil is decorated beautifully, clean, has great service, and the lunch deals are perfect for the working lunch crowd.   I've always been a fan of Thai food, and while there may be better out there - for what i'm looking for in a lunch option, this is the best. Love the yellow curry, great flavor. Also went for a basic fried rice dish one day and that was great too. Recommend this place for a quick lunch for a reasonable price :)

I work downtown and think it's great to have a nice little Thai place within walking distance to hit up for lunch. A couple of coworkers and I came in today and had a really awesome lunch.   We were starving when we got there and we immediately were seated, waited on, and had food orders placed within minutes. The menu is expansive with lots of options from pad thai to orange chicken and they have a special lunch menu on the back.   Our food arrived quickly and although I was pretty boring today and ordered the house fried rice, I was still really impressed with the flavor. My friends with the drunken noodles and orange chicken were both really happy too. We were done and paid up in only 40 minutes- perfect lunch spot.

I was lucky enough to visit NoDa while I was in Charlotte for work a few weeks ago. I'm quite a brewery hound, always using my fellow Yelpers recommendations to find the best beer bars and breweries when I travel. As usual, I was not led astray on this one.   NoDa is near downtown in a little area called North Davidson - hence the name. When I walked in, I loved the feel of the place. The bartenders are friendly and helpful and I took a seat at the bar to choose my flight. The view is of the brewery and they were conducting a tour at the time, so I got to check that out from my prime spot at the bar. I tried the Hop Drop N Roll, Coco Loco, Breast Friends - which is an amazing berliner with an even better cause proceeds go towards. I had a few more samples and ended up with a full pour of the Breast Freinds. I really enjoyed talking about beer with the other patrons, meeting the many pups that came in, and I got a nice dinner recommendation from the staff as well. This has got to the best brewery in Charlotte, and I highly recommend stopping by when you're in the area. I know I will if my travels take me back that way.

Lucky break was a welcome surprise I'm the strip mall with the china buffet and gun shop. My first time I was pleasantly surprised by the craft beer list, and on subsequent visits the food has also been a welcome surprise. Sure it's not much from the outside but when you venture inside, good bar food, tons of TVs, and a nice local craft beer lineup await. Go on taco Tuesday and get the cod tacos- awesome. Cheers!

Somehow despite hearing about this place before it opened and being excited to try it out, I'd never made it up there until this past weekend. My friends and I stopped in on Saturday afternoon for a late lunch/early dinner and a couple of beers. We were so impressed with everything about this place - from the service, to the menu, to the tap lineup and the ambiance. It really is an amazing place. They had happy hour on a Saturday from 3-5pm so we were lucky enough to be able to partake in those deals ordered the hummus and the pretzel and cheese to munch on along with our first round of drafts. I love that they have the matching glass for every beer they have on tap, really cool added touch.   For the main course since it was my first time, I went with the brat flight so I could try several kinds of brats plus I added in the beer pairings to match up. It was only $13 bucks and I highly recommend it. Oh and my friends ordered the garlic fries with all 3 kinds of dipping sauces. Those were awesome too. After all that, the place was cheap too! Love this place, I wish I lived closer so that I could join their Mug Club and really become a regular. Check them out, you're gonna be happy you did :)

I thought about giving this review a lesser rating because yes, there is better (read: expensive sushi) but honestly I wouldn't change a thing- we had a blast. And for rotating sushi this is top notch!   A gf and I stopped in for dinner last night and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We sat at a table right by the kitchen and were excited by the amount and selection of fresh choices that came out- rotating sushi is fun and they certainly were constantly updating and putting out new plates to ensure a fresh and tasty experience! Loved the fire dragon roll- ended up with 2 of those, edamame, golden dragon, and I orders the salmon love off the menu. It was all really tasty and fresh and our sake bombers to wash it down were a happy hour deal so we made out. We will be back- this place is fantastic!

After having just had a very disappointing appointment from my dentist of 6 years, I was a little apprehensive about going to any other dentist perhaps even more so because this was one of the chains. As soon as you walk in though, you know this is a different type of dentist. Everyone was so friendly and takes the time and effort to make you feel comfortable and informed. I've never had a dentist walk through my treatment plan, explain everything and help me figure out what we should treat first based on affordability. Dr. Lagrone is one of a kind and although I'm not looking forward to my crowns, I am happy that I have such an amazing dentist doing my dental work from now on.

I remember going to this location on opening night when Arizona landed its first World of Beer, and there were definitely some issues back then to work out. However, nowadays, this place is one of the best craft beer spots with excellent service, a full kitchen, and a beer list that can't be beat.   World of Beer often plays host to special beer events and tappings, and the staff at this location does an amazing job of handling the influx of guests. From the tables of 15 folks with all separate checks to the potential to run out of tasting glasses, they always are quick, efficient and handle the situations with a smile. Not to mention, the staff all go to beer school and are truly knowledgeable and can and do answer any of your beer questions.   This location is a great community partner as well, giving back to the community, supporting local breweries and supporting groups like the homebrew club here in Arizona. I'm a huge fan and anytime I'm on Mill I make a point to stop in and grab a beer.

I live in Chandler but happily make the trek up to Fate whenever I get the chance. Just a week or so ago, they debuted a new Sunday Brunch special so yesterday we all piled in the car to come try it out for ourselves. The deal is that you get any of their brunch entrees which include a variety of breakfast pizzas or breakfast skillets, and 2 5oz glasses of Fate beer for only 10 bucks! Cant be beat. They only have a pizza oven there, so that's why the menu is limited to pizza oven entrees, however you dont feel limited when you're eating their creations! I got the meat and potato skillet and my friends tried 2 of the other skillets -they were all winners and we cant wait to come back. Thanks for the great service, lovely atmosphere and amazing food and beer Fate! :)

Stopped in for lunch recently and had a great time as usual. The staff is friendly and helpful but also speedy so you can really get in and out for a lunch stop. Loved the specials that they have now- half salad and half pizza for 10 bucks is great. Thanks again Fate!

Is it really possible that I've not written a review for ATAH? Apparently so and its LONG overdue.   I've probably been into Angel's about 20 times over the past few years, attending their Anniversary parties, Beer Week Events, Tuesday TV dinner nights and, most importantly, as a pre-and post-game ritual before Dbacks games. This year I got myself a mini-season ticket package so have been in about 5 times in the past couple months.   This is THE beer bar in downtown. The selection is awesome, I always go for a flight because the pints can be a bit pricey but the flights are always $9 unless they have a rare beer on that's not flight-eligible. The food is incredible here, from the pizzas to the burgers to the salads and of course the homemade pop tarts. The staff can be hit and miss, but, if you sit at the bar you're pretty much guaranteed an awesome conversation with a top-notch bartender. Sam has been working the last few times I was in and is a great beer-fan to talk to get recommendations from, but every bartender has always been really good there.   Downsides, hmmm...well its very loud in there at times, super noisy building. Oh, and they close at 12, which is a bummer if your game went extra innings and you were ready to drink up a few rounds of awesome beer afterwards. But, they don't serve liquor, so I get it -can always head across the street. Really though, this place rocks. Come in, sit at the bar, get a flight and enjoy the awesomeness yourself. You'll be glad you did, Cheers!

Although I recently moved to Phoenix, I haven't stopped bringing my boy Winston down to cage free because of how convenient they are. Winston had a traumatic experience in a cage when he was 3 and ever since then he's been very frightened by them, so I've tried to only use cage-free places.   One of the best parts is that Winston is always done within 90 minutes and looks pretty good - the staff there is pretty young and likely inexperienced, but I feel like the consultations and effort made to try to cut him exactly as I want more than make up for that.   My last appointment with them was Saturday and the young lady that groomed him was really great, asking good questions about my preferences and then returning my pup to me in 60 minutes. Can't ask for a better turnaround than that.

I've been here a few times now and I have to say that I really enjoy the experience. Is it the best Vietnamese food in town? Probably not. But, its got a great atmosphere, is in the heart of the downtown Phoenix in the historic San Carlos hotel, and is open for lunch. The last part is an important factor when you work at the building right across the street from it :) I've had the Pho, the lunchbox, and yesterday I had the Bun salad. I really enjoyed all of it - and I know the price might not be super cheap but I think its a good value for lunch and we really enjoy having something besides bar food in the downtown area. Try it out yourself, I think you'll be happy you did too :)

Came in last night for probably my 5th or so visit here since they opened. Sad to say i continue to find the overall experience lackluster at best. It looked like the menu had changed from my previous horrific dining experience here with basically unedible and horribly overcooked food when they first opened...so I went for a happy hour special. Pretzel and beer cheese? Sure I'd been in for beers since then, but I'd always hesitated to order anything to eat. But I have a soft spot for pretzels and cheese!! Sounds great! Sadly, it was another huge let down. The pretzel was clearly store bought and soggy with a sad off-white color to it like they didn't even bother cooking it to the specifications on the box it came in, the beer cheese was not much better. I appreciate that they appreared to have made the cheese, however it started to congeal after about 30 seconds, the joys of Velveeta. Sure it was a happy hour deal, but it was gross and shouldn't have been served like that.   The waitress, while friendly was really uneducated when it came to beer and seemed to be either unaware or just oblivious to the fact that there was a beer event and special beer tapping happening for beer week. She took one person's order and then didn't come back for 20 minutes while everyone eagerly waited to get their chance to order the specialty beer. I really don't find this place to be a fun place to hangout and have beers and don't recommend it, I have given it several shots and came up empty everytime.

Perhaps typing this review while I'm anxiously awaiting lunch hour is not the best idea, I'm drooling on my keyboard thinking about the Stand goodness! I've been here a half-dozen times now, have brought friends with me and everyone has loved everything they've gotten. I'd say the burger is my favorite item, and if you're feeling like a serious indulgence go for the Salted Dulce de Leche Shake - its like heaven in a cup.   I've ordered and ate inside as well as gone through the drive-thru window there, and each time my experience has been great. They're making the meals to order, so obviously you're going to wait a minute that but that's better than being served a heat-lamp patty anyday! I love that the burgers as seasoned so well, amazing every time. The fries weren't really my thing, but I'm a picky fry eater so that's to be expected. The tacos were really good too, I've tried all of them and typically lean toward the chicken one as my favorite.   Give the stand a shot, you're going to be glad you did. Can't beat hot, fresh, made to order food for a reasonable price! :)

My friends and I were staying at a downtown hotel for NYE and planned to grab some food and beers at the hotel before hitting up our final destination. Lucky for us, the hotel wasnt offering their usual happy hour deal so we were in a scramble to find a new spot with good food and drinks - Squid Ink to the rescue! Not only did they have a happy hour on NYE, but they have amazing food and great local craft beer on tap. Couldnt have been happier when we go there - great place with amazing staff. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were so attentive and friendly, even offering to ring up our final beers before happy hour ended and bringing them to us when we were ready. Loved the food - the crab rangoon had huge chunks of crab in it, the wings were great, and the miso black cod dish? Probably the best thing I've eaten in months. Ridiculous - and for half price happy hour! Absolutely loved this place, cant wait to go back and meet up for happy hour again with my friends soon.

What do you get when you cross an old church, craft beer and cocktails, and modern mexican food? Perfection. I just took my out of town guests here for my 2nd visit and I realized how much I need to make Taco Guild a staple in my life.   The staff is super friendly, all the waiters help eachother out and ensure that every diner has what they need super fast. I've probably ordered every taco on the menu at some point and they're all delicous. My friends got the guac and loved that too, although I'm weird and don't partake myself. The lamb taco reallllllly stood out to me last time, I wish my entire platter was just those. The drinks are as good as the food and everything is reasonablely priced. After Gallo Blanco closed and changed names on me, I'd been on the lookout for another modern mexican place and I'd have to say that Taco Guild is even better! Check them out, its awesome.

If you love craft beer and amazing burgers, this is the spot for you. Probably the best deal in town is Wedsnesday nights- featuring your choice of the specialty burger of the day or the Ivan burger along with any craft brew on tap for only $10. Seriously, it's amazing, the burgers are just about perfect everytime. The pretzel bun is the ideal bun for the big juicy meaty goodness as well, and just might be the best part. Clearly I'm a fan.  Also, there are great views of camelback and service has always been good as well. Get over there on a Wednesday, you'll be glad you did!

So this place is pretty much the best concept for fast made-to-order I've seen. Amazing. I've been in 4 times now, and can honestly say this place is just wonderful. The last time I popped in for a to-go pizza on my way home from work. I love that I can customize and make it my own, and they are there with recommendations or just a smile while you keep adding on. I sat down and just a few minutes later my pizza was ready - the girl brought it to me and showed me the pizza to make sure it looked great to me before closing the box up. I thought that was a nice touch, this place is clean, fast, friendly, convenient but most importantly the food is great and for a great price! Give it a try - and if I you have a Dividend Miles Card you get double points here :)

Just realized I hadn't written a review about this place yet. This place is such a great concept- love the atmosphere with all the foliage and the bird rescue aspect is awesome. Rooftop patio is super cool, although I'll be avoiding for the next few months it now that summer is here! But when we get to fall- that's where I can be found :) I have enjoyed my meals there, particularly the last time. The bartender was amazing, stopped in for lunch and he really made the experience great- whether it be samples of beer or recommednations off the menu or even offering to customize my burger so that's it's just perfect for me. I'll be back again and soon!

Met a former colleague here for happy hour a week or 2 ago and was pleasantly surprised when I arrived by the ample parking out front and just how HUGE a place this is. I love the feel of it, very rustic and charming décor that really invites you in.   We sat at the bar and enjoyed some happy hour wine (on tap) and got some bites of food. the short rib potstickers were these awesome melt-in-your-mouth bites of goodness -highly recommend that. The fries were good too, HUGE serving of those and the brie toast was nice, nothing to write home about. I really liked the plating and the visual appeal of the food though, they do such a great job at all the Fox restaurants of recognizing we eat with our eyes first! Love the plating here. Overall, we had a blast, 2 hours flew by and my friend even got a yummy dessert and coffee with Baileys to complete our happy hour date. It was a great time, did the bar staff forget about us as they got busier - sure. Did the check come with a bit of sticker shock for a few apps, 2 wines and dessert - indeed. But its a great spot and I'd love to come back for brunch or something soon.

Perhaps I'm just the neighsayer of the group here but I've got to think as a brewery in Phoenix we can all do MUCH better. Lets start with the name...why on Earth would you name your brewery Bad Water - beer is mostly water and I certainly don't want to think about anything bad to do with my beer's ingredients.   Next thing, there are 3 beers offered here and of the three, well actually no, they're all really REALLY terrible. There's an IPA, and I love IPAS, but this one is lacking in hops, nose, flavor so basically a poor man's hopped water. The saison is equally bad with an overly alcohol forward, almost acetone-like flavor which overpowers the nice belgian yeast you're looking for in this style and then the lager. Well, that's the best one and I don't even like lagers as a style but it's the least offensive beer they have.   Sure there are guest taps (Uncle Bear's, Angry Orchard, maybe an Oak Creek Hefe), but there are much better beer bars in the area - Craft 64 to name one standout. Also, there are some nice tables and decent cheese boards to enjoy here. So if you don't like beer, you might like it here? Honestly though, its a brewery and they are doing a disservice to the awesome AZ beer scene by calling themselves that. Go to Goldwater or Two Brothers, you'll be glad you did.

On a glowing recommendation from several coworkers, I went to see the lovely Rachel to get a cut, color and highlight a few months back and I'm happy to say I've found my new hair home :) She's amazing, she's fast and accurate does a wonderful job with color and can cut your hair anyway you want. I left feeling great and have been back once since then for a touchup and a dusting. I have recommended her to a few friends and I think my bestie might be switching to her soon since she does such a great job on my hair.

When my coworker first mentioned this place was opening I began to drool uncontrollably. When I pulled up the website and saw the pictures my eyes glazed over and the thoughts of consuming these amazing creations began to take up most of my days. Finally the day of my donut experience has arrived! I jumped out of bed this morning already knowing which donuts I'd be happily forking over whatever price they wanted in order to scarf down (ps- the price wasn't bad at all!) Arriving and ordering was all a blur as once the smell of hot donuts hits you, there is no room for other thoughts. But eating them? The lemonade donut changed my life, I'm pretty sure I can never settle for another donut shop again. And then the salted caramel, because I couldn't stop with just one. So warm, sweet, flavorful and delish!! Fractured prune- I love you.

My second time here today and this place is really exactly what you want in an airport eatery- quick service with a smile. Sat at the bar both times and the bartenders have been attentive and welcoming.   Settled on the omelet last time and this time I went for the burrito sans the jalapeños...since I can be a wimp about that. It comes out looking delicious and tasting the same. It took only 8 minutes for my food to come out too- which is pretty awesome if you ask me. I walk over here from the A gates because I prefer this breakfast to others- it is this specialty after all. Check then out if uou're here in the AM.

So, I went to Dubina a couple times a year ago when they first opened and noted the fact that they were just starting out and that their beer needed to be improved as they went along. Happy to report that they've done that and the beer is now much improved.   Due to a power outage a few weeks ago, as the bartender explained, there were only a few beers on tap. They unfortunately had to dump several batches due to the outage - sucks and hopefully they can recoup that in no time. The beers I tried were all solid and true to style. I had the IPA, the Hefe, the Black IPA and the Gratzie. Now that last one isn't really for me (HATE smoked beers) but my friend was able to polish that off for me and enjoyed it a lot. The staff was super nice, even giving us a little tour of the setup. Very unique and creative setup for the space since there is a combo system and the obstacles such as ceiling tiles and not having high ceilings throughout to combat there.  I'd come back, maybe even try some food next time - so the review is just beer/service for now. More to come.

Mother Bunch is a breath of fresh air added much needed craft beer and yummy food to roosevelt row. They have literally just opened their doors and already there are very few kinks to work out - that's impressive.   This place is gorgeous, decorated very cleanly and simply with a nice big bar in the middle and plenty of space. We got a tour from the brewer of the brewing space in the back and its really coming along nicely. They hope to have that up in running soon so we all get to try some of the MB Brew. In the interim, they feature 20 all AZ taps that are really great - not just the normal fare that you see around but also some interesting beers. I had a Fresh Hopped IPA (Fresh Magic), a Sour (Citrana), and a Black IPA (Lost Highway) which were all great - it was a little tough to swallow the $6/beer even during happy hour though but overall I was happy. They had some great discount food options to make the happy hour more happy - including a mac and cheese trio and house made pork rinds.   Really cool spot, I recommend checking this out and saying hi to the friendly staff there. I'll be back again for lunch this week!

Another East Valley Brewery? Yep, the more the merrier!   Have been to BRI 3 times now, and this is probably the start of a serious trend. I love the decor when you walk in, the flask lights and the cool science themed wall hangings plus the flights are served in little beakers, very cute. For a first effort on a new system I think these guys are off to a great start. I like the Street Cred and then I tried the 480G and its a fantastic example of a West Coast IPA. The Belgians aren't my favorite but like i said, great start for these guys.   The guest taps are great and really reasonably priced. They really have a great variety too - even the ciders for those that like the sweet stuff. The food menu is nice, I had an issue with my order the first time I was there and they quickly fixed it for me and made sure i was happy - gotta love the customer service! All the bartenders have been super helpful and friendly and the atmosphere is really nice - communal tables and no TVs - forced us to actually talk to eachother!   Give BRI a shot, you won't be disappointed. :)

I've been to UB probably a half-dozen times at this point and figured it was a time for a review. First the positives, I love the space - amazing decor, huge space, awesome outdoor patio, giant beer board, and the parking is really convenient too. The happy hour is a good deal if you stick to beer - often you can score some great releases for $3 or $4 bucks a pour.   However, there are quite a few negatives as well. About those beer pours, the UB takes the stance that 1-1.5 inches of head is a good pour. Well that might be fine when we're talking about a pint glass here - but when you leave several inches of space on my 10oz snifter, I'm not going to be happy. I've never complained about bad pours, but for one bartender in particular there, it was ridiculous. The other bartender working actually came by and took my glass back and added to it the last time it happened, apologizing for the bad pour, so I know its not just me here. Another thing that bothered me is that the bad-pour bartender also proceeded to have a conversation at the bar within earshot of my group about how he couldnt wait to get off and head downtown to get wasted at Chase Field. Now, I don't know about you, but I would think discussing plans to get hammered in front of customers wouldnt be acceptable in a nice establishment.   Now, about the food. The happy hour menu is a complete waste of money - I've ordered a couple items from there and all are very undersized for the price - nothing "happy" about that! The mac and cheese came out in a tiny tray and when i saw it, I actually started laughing - probably about 5 bites of food for $7 bucks? It was crazy, I sent that back immediately. On 2 other visits, we've tried to order the parmesean garlic fries with our meals - and both times they came out cold and soggy in a tiny tray. We tried to send them back once, only to receive the same soggy sad excuse for a fry back in return. Steer clear. I've had a few items that were decent from the menu, the seared tuna and the patty melt were both nice but IMO, this place is just not worth the inconsistent service, food, and pricing.

My absolute favorite grab and go lunch spot on Mill. This place is just awesome in every way. First off, the menu is fun with all the sandwiches named after famous folk and some some local ones thrown in for good measure.   I think the best thing, besides the awesome food, is the staff. Everyone and I mean every single person every time I go in there is just so friendly and warm and exuding a love for their job. They chat with you about your day, make sure you leave happy and are just awesome to be around. Now the food itself is great too - the sandwiches are a monster size so i usually would go for the lunch combos which are a half sammy with chips and a drink on the cheap. Every single sandwich is amazing, espeically if you get it on the Dutch bread - hello crunchy factor to raise up the sandwich bread game!   Try these guys out, you'll love it if you're in the mood for sandwiches...and LOVE-ly people :)

So I just moved back to the Arcadia area from the ho-hum offerings of the suburbs and this place is like a breath of fresh air! I love everything about it - from the decor and layout with the huge bar right in the middle of the room to the throwback games to the happy hour pricing and awesome beer and wine selections. The staff is amazing, very attentive, fast, and I love paying on an iPad and never having the card leave your sight.   I cant recommend this place enough - I've told all my beer friends, and even had a few of my wino girlfriends join me here and we all love it. Oh and the grilled cheese options are a GREAT snack, fresh ingredients and fast!

Healthy food doesnt have to be bland and this place proves that. Love Grabbagreen, I work downtown so I am within walking distance and when its not surface-of-the-sun hot outside, I make the trek down to get my fix. I love the smoothies, I've had several and they let you substitute if you're not a fan of one of the ingredients (for me, banana- ick) plus they are reasonably priced for the amount and goodness that you receive. I really like the Looking Luscious and Feeling Fabulous ones - yumm!  I also love the bowls, there is an Asian one - Tokyo Bay- that is to die for with salmon and edamame and brown rice and other goodies. Seriously good and there is a TON in that bowl, looks can be deceiving on the packaging. Basically, check this place out - its healthy, fast, easy, and full of flavor!

I drive by this establishment often and have been wanting to stop in every since I saw it open months ago. I'm glad I finally did the other night while looking for a place for a quick bite with my mom. The first thing I noticed about Frasher's was just how friendly everyone was - from the man out front out held the door open and greeted us to the girl who took our orders to the guy who brought out our food - everyone seemed genuinely happy and that really makes a world of difference in your dining experience.   Much like many other smokehouse or BBQ places, this is your counter-ordering and then open seating experience. The décor is inviting with a large patio out front which is exactly where we landed on this lovely spring/winter night. We ordered the burnt ends sandwich with no bun and the chicken with no bun along with the green chili mac and the mashed potatoes to share. We also got a slice of the butter cake to split as well.   The food came out very quickly, was hot and was reasonably portioned. I thought the sides were a little small, but that could be just how they presented them in a tiny little stryofoam cups on the plates. The chicken was melt-in-your-mouth good and I seriously could go back just for that again and again. The burnt ends were decent, I've had much better but they did not disappoint me in any way - just not the best version of a product that I'm a HUGE fan of. The slice of cake was small but it was the perfect size because of how rich it was - tasted just like Christmas butter cookies that we make every year. A great treat for the end of a nice meal. I might just have to stop by for a to-go order tonight, really good experience.

Wren House is a welcome addition to the growing CenPho beer scene. Having just moved back to Phx from the east valley where breweries like Arizona Wilderness had me spoiled on crafty goodness, I am super excited to see a quality brewery open up so close to home. I've been in a few times now and continue to be impressed with everything.   With most new breweries, I've come to expect that their initial offerings aren't the best - normally takes some time to get used to the new brewer/system and work out the kinks. But, this is not the case at Wren House. Everything is delightful here, and I tried everything from the IPA to the Stout to the Lager. Even if its not my favorite style, I respect that they're doing each style justice.   The decor is also super cute - a nice old building with a community vibe going on. I like that there are no TVs, forces us to be friendly and talk to each other! I've had the opportunity to meet several other beer fans while sitting at the bar there, the customers are all very cool, passionate but laid back. The staff, especially Brad, are amazing there as well - he remembers your name and your order and really takes the time to greet and connect with the customers. Check this place out - swing by for a growler fill or stay and have a few brews. They're active on social media and let you know their hours and beer lineup daily, so you can stay in the know. Cheers!

As big a fan of the original Fate North location as I am, I knew I'd enjoy my experience at the new Fate South. But I didn't know I'd LOVE it as much as I do.   The space is HUGE, spacious and beautiful. You can walk in through the front, or, you're even invited to pass the barrel room and the brewing space by coming in the side door. I love to walk that route and see what the awesome brewer is cooking up next for us :)   Fate's owner Steve is a huge supporter of the craft beer scene here in the valley so its no surprise that they were recently named one of the best beer bars in America. As a result, Fate threw a fan appreciation event on Saturday, which was my most recent (of many) visits here. Even though the place was packed with wall to wall folks and standing-room only, the staff was all smiles and was working quickly and diligently to keep the beer flowing and the bellies full. They really did a great job and I know my friends and I loved trying so many of their offerings for only $3 on that day.   The menu is awesome here, a full kitchen offers more variety but also more chances to miss the mark - Fate South does not make that mistake though. I usually get one of their awesome salads or the chicken sandwich. But if you really want a treat, go for the pretzels and beer cheese. This is the kind of warm, salty, butter goodness that cheat days were created for! Hop you enjoy Fate as  much as I do, and check out the North location and their awesome pizzas!

This second location for Sip is an awesome addition to this cool section of Indian School. With Pig's Meow, the Attic, Little Woody around here, there is a plethora of awesome hangout options with great craft beer and cocktails/wines as well.   The best part about this spot though is that they have a drive-thru for coffees and morning treats. I've enjoyed several options off their menu, and have found the service in the morning fast, friendly and of course the make great coffee!   Met a girlfriend here for happy hour on Friday, I love how this used to be a garage/oil change joint so the roll-up garage doors and intact and offer awesome light and air to the joint. The decor is cozy with antique pieces thrown in, very much like the Pig's Meow new expansion. Great craft beer options along with some cool cocktails. I'll be back soon!

So, I've only been to Noodles & Co. once before, wayyyy back in my college days and in a Columbus, Ohio location (Go Buckeyes!). I remembered it fondly so on my lunch hour today I popped in for a quick bite. Sadly, the food at this one and the price have forever replaced my fond memory of this place.   I ordered a small portion of the Japanese noodles dish with grilled chicken and a small drink...almost 10 bucks. Ok, well its noodles, so at least i'll get a lot of food and have lefovers for dinner. Wrong. I watched and he literally put a small handful of noodles in the bowl and topped with dry, flavorless grilled chicken. The sauce and the veggies in the bowl were good and it tasted fine, but seriously? Its been about 3 hours and i'm already hungry again because the portion was teeny tiny. There is no reason for that, noodles are the cheapest thing! I'll never be back, I can spend ten bucks a lot of places around there and still have leftovers for dinner.   The reason I did add a star was that the staff was super friendly and helpful. From the girl that checked on me while I was staring up at the menu to the guy cleaning the tables and asking me how my dish was, everyone was really wam and inviting. Doesn't make up for the food and price though, pass.

I may be a bit older than the typical Cobra clientele but that didn't stop my friends and I from having a blast there on Friday night after closing down Angel's Trumpet across the street. Loved the DJ playing all sorts of fun music to dance to plus there was no wait to get in, reasonable drink prices and craft beer on tap, plus tons of awesome games from my childhood. The best part might just be the crowds are all very fun and welcoming although there was such a varied group from the gamers to the hipsters and even my friends in our 30s. Good times.   I took my friend in here again on Sunday afternoon, decidedly different experience during the daylight, but still a really cool spot. I recommend a stop, very cool joint worth checking out for sure.

On my way home and starving today, the construction at 44th street diverted me here. What a happy diversion it was.   This place has "happy hour" daily with half price Fish Tacos. Two guesses what I ordered. They came out cooked to order, hot, not greasy and HUGE portions of flaky fish. And then I got to go get my fixins at the station- love places where I can try all the salsas and fun stuff on display. Got cabbage, lime, two kinds of salsas, and chipotle cream to make my tacos just perfect. Less than 5 bucks later, I'm stuffed and can't wait to go back!

Do you ever put off going to a new spot in town because you know as soon as you do the instant addiction will hit and you'll be forever thinking about Poke bowls? No? Just me? Ok.   Well, that was my predicament and I held out as long as I could and then finally in late June gave in and made my first trip to Ahipoke Bowl and they are everything I imagined them to be. I've now been 5 times in the past 2 weeks. Addiction is real.   You walk in and are greeted by the Chipotle-style menu board and line, your eyes widen as you realize all the choices and topping and awesomeness that awaits you. Go for the regular bowl to kick things off, but you'll quickly graduate to the large bowl for only $2 more. The difference is 2 scoops of seafood or 3 - choices like salmon, tuna, spicy tuna and scallops. I've now perfected my order of 1/3 brown rice 2/3 salad in the large bowl, with house spicy sauce on my 2 scoops of salmon and 1 scoop of spicy tuna. Then I just go all in on the toppings - things like edamame, jicama, seaweed salad, sesame seeds, wasabi, ginger, fish eggs, krab salad and you can also add avocado for $1 more. Tried the green tea last time and wasn't too impressed, I'll just stick to water and make the bowl my main focus as it should be.   Its all delicious and I want it everyday now - breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, late-night. I'm starting a support group, see you guys there at 11am daily for lunch. And then again for dinner. As far as addictions go, this isn't a bad one to have, right? See you there :)

Drove by every so often as the built this place eagerly awaiting the opening. Then once it did, my office was transferred to Chandler and I thought all hope of enjoyment at Salad and Go were lost.   How ever, I luckily found myself on the north side and got to enjoy (finally) the fresh healthy drive thru options! Went for an Asian salad with chicken and green tea. You can tell this was put together fresh just for you and I loved that. Tasted great too, loved the dressing that I got on the side, tasty chicken and the green tea was perfect to wash it all down. Can't wait until CenPho or old town area gets one!
