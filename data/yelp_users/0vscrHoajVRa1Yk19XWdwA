Is this real life? $3.99 6 packs and $7.99 12 packs of craft beer? My brain melted when I went down the beer aisle. This place is bananas, a total gem. The guy at the counter is always super chill too; best corner store in the hood!

Biscuits,  pbr tall boys, craft beers on draft... need I say more? I always end up here as an attempt to sober up after hitting up the bars off of Roosevelt. Long story short it never happens because they sell beer and I just end up getting extra wasted. But, it's okay! Their food is a great hangover cure, so I just come back the next morning and stuff myself with the best biscuits EVER. Hangover situation averted.

I used to be an avid food city shopper until I found Ranch market. This store is super clean, organized and has amazingly affordable fresh produce. I literally grocery shop nowhere else. I'm in love.

The menu is simple and the portions are huge! Be prepared for a line out the door. They are no longer cash only!

Carolina's is a diamond in the rough.   The ambiance is sketchy yet homey at the same time.   The foods is always tasty, I recommend any burrito, as they're huge and wrapped in homemade tortillas.  Remember to take home a bag of chips and/or tortillas! They're cheap and super fresh.  Four stars for never having carne asada and the weird salsa bar.

I love the staff at this location.  I hit the drive thru everyday on lunch and the service is always fast and friendly! I don't live in this area,  so I always miss the chill employees when I visit other locations!

I really love this location. Every time I come here to buy jewelry, I regret getting pierced anywhere else.   The last piercing I got was my septum. I went to HTC in Tempe because I was drunk and it was nearby.  I've had jewelry replaced there too,  and it's literally 2x more expensive than Halo.   This location is by far my favorite (I've visited the Tucson locations) as every experience here has been exceptional.  I don't know why it's taken me so long to write a review  (let's be real-- I'm lazy).  But today I went in looking for jewelry I knew I couldn't afford, and Frank picked out the perfect piece in my price range.  I can't get over the fact that he found the perfect piece for me with such little direction.   I'm super happy (as is my bank account), thanks Frank!  Will be back and would recommend for sure!

$5 drafts Radical staff Super chill spot, a "fancy" dive I'm new to the valley, a tucson native & sf transplant, and I was worried there weren't any rad dives here. I was wrong for sure. I was a regular at Che's lounge and I've finally found my replacement; feels good to be home.

Jacob pierced my septum tonight and I'm totally stoked. I'm a wimp about needles, but he made the process quick and totally painless! I will definitely be back to be pierced by him, and will recommend him to all of my friends and family. This place is walk in only, so get there at a minimum of 30 minutes before close. HTC is clean,  affordable and totally legit.

Don't come here.  Not sanitary and the quality is terrible.  Worst $30 gel manicure ever. Such a sloppy job.  I could have gotten what I wanted for the same price at a Scottsdale nail salon. TERRIBLE.

I used to love nextcare because of the cleanliness and consistency of every location. But the last two times I visited the Thomas location I just had a terrible experience; later to find out from a specialist that the doctor named Jessica Henry actually "treated" me incorrectly. But nextcare still sent me a huge bill. Oh well, my fault for choosing urgent care instead of a specialist, right? But, no! They have to keep haunting me, reminding me of my poor life choices. Months after I paid off the bill they keep sending  me the SAME bill stating that it's  past due, ect. Um helllo, my bank statement shows that you already took the money from my account months ago. I can never reach a human when I call billing services.  STOP HARASSING ME AHHHH Never again!

This is the best fast food you can get in the hood. I live in the Garfield, and used to frequent Salsitas on 16th & Roosevelt,  but over the past year the quality is lacking.  The bf and I were super stoked to find this place! They're open late, and the food is ALWAYS fresh.  Literally this is the only fast food place I willingly order rice, it's never old and hard (EW)   The best part is the excellent customer service.  This place is a total dive so it was unexpected.  Anyways,  embrace the window riddled with bullet holes,  the 50 cent fee for paying with card,  and the gnarly location where multiple shootings/stabbings have taken place. All that matters is the food is consistently good.

This place saved my life. The boyfriend and I were wasted, lost, and starving downtown when this place shined like a beacon out of the darkness. I had the chile relleno burrito and he had 4 carne asada tacos with a coke and our total was only 11 bucks. Seriously the food is amazing, and I will venture back soon.

This is a great shop that I'll likely frequent every year when I visit vegas. It's  very clean, the artists offer quality work, and the prices are very reasonable. I called weeks ahead to schedule an appointment, but was assured that I would be tattooed as a walk in. When I made my way in there, the shop was bustling with people. I was slightly worried I wouldn't be able to get a tattoo; there were only a few hours until closing time. But, I only had to wait an hour and got exactly what I wanted.   **By the way this place is cash only**

I seriously died when I walked into this store! Everything is organized and the prices are really reasonable. There is an equal balance between women's and men's merchandise;  normal thrift shops are lacking in the men's department. They even have cufflinks and tie clips!  This store is filled with so many gems, definitely will be back soon.

I LOVE this place simply because of the beer situation. There have almost 40 different beers to choose from! A flight is nine bucks and comes with six generous samples in a muffin tin. Anytime someone from out of town is visiting,  I bring them here before we go bar hopping.  They have a private parking lot and a bike rack which makes getting here and meeting friends convenient.  I do try to avoid this place on Friday's during their dinner rush,  the wait can exceed an hour.

The service here has plummeted. I keep coming back because I thoroughly enjoy the beer selection. But every time I dine here, I wait for too long - for EVERYTHING. I'm bummed because I really want to love  this place. But there are way better  places downtown that deliver an extraordinary dining experience. Ditch this place if you want good service.

So happy about the service improvements.  I love this place and always bring people here when they're visiting the Valley. The beer selection is top notch and the food is always great.  I had a few bad experiences here, but they must have gotten rid of some bad seeds, as the service has been exceptional my past few visits.

This location  is super convenient for me,  I'm so glad I finally checked it out. I got a glitter french tip mani for $32 and was in and out in no time. The staff was personable and friendly, the atmosphere is very relaxed. I had the pleasure of getting my nails done by Dung and he was so rad I'll be sure to request him in two weeks! Be sure to show the tech a photo of what look you're going for, my nails turned out exactly like the photo I brought in. Couldn't be happier!

Mondays and Tuesdays are super radical.  $20 for two pitchers of beer (or a bottle of wine) and a pizza.  Too good to pass up.

Fuq! Why didn't I find this little gem sooner? I had the pleasure of meeting Sam today during my first visit, and he is so rad. The espresso is delicious as are the vibes. This is going to be my new regular spot for my morning fix.

I haven't been here for maintence, so my review is strictly customer service oriented. My boyfriend and I came in for a lock, which they didn't have in stock. They offered to order it for us, but we needed it right away. They kindly gave us suggestions on where we could find what we were looking for, and recommended what to buy. It was really cool of them to help us out even though they knew we wouldn't be buying anything from them. The chill vibe makes me want to come back, and it's good to know they can order anything you could possibly need.

I've been here one time, and I had a great experience. I was taking a weekend trip to Jerome on a motorcycle, and was in need of a military duffel (luggage marketed as motorcycle accessories sell upward of $100 and look exactly like military supply).  I knew I wanted the backpack style duffel, and was guided to their location directly after walking inside.  Once I saw their stock, I was able to find two huge bins of the style I wanted in used condition. Not only did the used stock look way rad, but they were priced at $19.50 (11 bucks cheaper than new condition).  Don't get me wrong, this place doesn't have everything (didnt see much camping supply or survival/defense literature). My favorite is still The Miller's Surplus in Tucson, AZ. But, considering I live in the valley, this was the next best thing.   I found what I needed in less than five minutes under my anticipated budget. Will be returning.

I'm new to the valley but I somehow always end up here, highly intoxicated, after a long night of drinking before last call. I love the patio (there are heaters everywhereeeeee) and can't quite remember what the inside is like; but from what I do remember, the staff is awesome. Rad neighborhood spot for sure.

Pizza People has drink specials all day EVERYDAY (my bf and I tend to frequent on Fridays for the $4 Jack Daniels special)   I've always had a great experience here. There is bike parking nearby and a dog friendly patio stocked with water bowls for your pooch. It's also a good spot to catch a game and grab a quick bite.   It's not my favorite pizza place in the Valley, but they have so much more to offer than just pizza. Get the monkey bread!  The staff is consistently friendly and attentive, and I never have to wait to be seated here, a huge plus for the location.   Keep doing what you're doing Pizza People.

A good friend of mine referred me to this place, and I am forever in her debt.  The first thing I noticed upon arrival was the smell. It smells so clean! Not the typical smells of chemicals that are all too norm at every other nail place. I didn't have an appointment, and only had to wait about five minutes for my gel mani to start. I was helped by Luanne, and I highly recommend her!  She was meticulous,  sweet,  and professional. She gave me the killer mani I wanted,  and I'm sure to become a regular. P.S. they have every color of polish,  glitter,  and gel you could possibly want. It's amazing!

I came for the Bitwell Gringo, but stayed for the good vibes.  I haven't had any work done here, but the shop was stuffed with sleds, so they definitely have a strong following. I will definitely return for routine maintenance.   I ordered a helmet here and they made the process super easy. They also offer the lowest price on the helmet I wanted, it was literally cheaper than any online vendor.  If you're looking for something specific I would definitely recommend ordering through headkace, the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable.   Overall I had a great experience, and plan on becoming a regular customer. It feels good to support local, and the people here are just so rad.  The central location is very convenient, and I heard they offer free pickup/towing service to help get you back on the road. That alone sets the level of customer service so much higher than anywhere else in the valley.   Check em out and tell yer friends!

I'm pretty disappointed.   I was super stoked to leave my Harley in the hands of these dudes after checking out their shop.  I went in with a fuel leak, and ended up leaving with a new fuel leak two and a half months later. :/  They replaced the gas tank which looks awesome, but looks mean nothing when performance of the bike is sacrificed.   After paying a nice chunk of change I expected to leave with a well running machine; especially considering the length of time it took for completion.  I paid more than I was quoted, which happens, but they could have at least checked for something as silly as leaks before sending me on my way. Am I wrong?  Oh well, I'll be taking my money elsewhere.

I love this place.  1. The crust is amazing  2. They deliver to the Garfield   3. They're open late  The slices are huge! The kind of slice you have to fold in half to eat without looking like a savage.  And seriously - the crust - it's amazing! So crispy!  I also like that their side salads are of the baby spring mix variety, none of that iceberg bs!  This is the only good/local pizza I can get delivered to my side of the hood. They always save the day after countless hours of boozing downtown.   Side note : I've never recieved poor customer service here like other reviews have stated.   And I've occupied this pizza joint completely belligerent.   So cheers to the consistently good food and service!

If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, you definitely have to check this place out! The restaurant is super clean and the customer service is awesome. I usually get the carne asada tacos or burrito which I definitely recommend.  If you stop by on the weekend try the menudo! Always yummy never greasy.

I love coming here to work, the atmosphere is wonderful. The seating area is small, airy, and bright.   The staff is very polite, and no one pesters me for working here all day long. Also the coffee is great, and excellent motivation to keep me going.  Love the new location!

Really great little spot.  I work from home and needed wifi while I deal with the hassle of transferring my utilities over during my move.  There is fast wifi and you don't have to get here super early to save a seat. (Unlike the coffee shops in my old hood on Roosevelt Row)  Plus they have a drive through, super cool feature that makes it so much easier to support local. So convenient!  Will definitely be coming back, and not just to work. :)

Valley Bar is reminiscent of a speakeasy and the entrance is stashed in an alley way (across the street from Seamus McCaffrey's, follow the red light).  Upon entry there is a flight of stairs descending into a dark dank basement. Once you go through the doors at the end of the stairs, you instantly feel like you have traveled to a different decade.   The bar is decorated with spinning metal mobiles,  writh their shadows being protected onto canvas that is draped above the bar. A focal wall is covered with kitschy vintage paintings, everything is so visually appealing.  There are free table top games (jenga!) and an entire game room next to the venue entrance.  I've been here a few times, and weekdays seem to be the best if you don't like crowds (Monday for specials). If you show up after 10pm on a Friday or Saturday, expect to wait in aline.

Vintage junkies unite *thrusts fist into air*  This place has been cool forever, but the new location is a stones throw from my house, so extra cool points.  But truly Antique Sugar is an awesome addition to downtown, we needed this! The selection is incredible!  I  wrote a review for their previous location explaining how special and unique this place truly is, but I will reiterate for the newbies.   Everything is so reasonably priced and they actually have a decent Men's department with accessories (unusual at most vintage boutiques, yey for equality!)  The layout is super organized and easy to shop. Which is great for you weirdos that get overwhelmed and have panic attacks when you step into an overly full thrift shop.  I seriously have friends and family that drive from Tucson just to shop here. It don't matter if you live the Valley or you're just visiting, you have to check it out! :)

The perfect place to scoop up a gift for the beer connesiur in your life.  A bit pricey,  but the cost reflects the quality.   I've been meaning to stop in here,  but I finally had a legitimate excuse to blow cash on booze with Christmas right around the corner - so glad I did!   The dude at the counter was super friendly and gave me several recommendations to point me in the right direction.   A much needed addition to downtown, will gladly be returning soon. Support Local my dudes!
