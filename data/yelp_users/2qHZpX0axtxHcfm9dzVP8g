On my way to work on a random Monday I decided I needed an extra pick me up of caffeine to give me the extra skip in my step after a long weekend ...   Walking in I was surprised at the rustic feel compared to the exterior (clean but a totally normal little food strip). The lighting was the perfect shade of coffee house dim, the colors were rich and comforting and the aroma was hypnotizing to this coffee bean lover.   There were two people ahead of me and one behind me who were obvious regulars since the baristas knew their beverages of choice. I'm always impressed when this happens anywhere!   Ok anyway...My go to drink is a classic 'ol {Latte} . The temperature was perfect...not lukewarm or too hot...juuuuust right.   I'm not gonna lie, I wish my cuppa Joe tasted as good as the place looked...I'll definitely try Hava Java again since its location is super convenient on my way to work but I'm not sure if it's gonna be 'my' coffee spot near the office yet....  Decision pending...

Came in for round two and man do you know how to make an amazing Americano!!!  I splurged and added steamed breve. Delicious delicious delicious. My brew was rich, smooth and the perfect temperature (I prefer my beverages hotter than the average joe).  Thank you for the perfect Friday morning caffeine jolt!!!  I'll definitely be back sooner than later!  //cheers//

Being new to the area we heard good things about Oregano's and decided to try to try it out on a Friday night around oh 7??  Wow, was it PACKED with a good one hour wait. We were too hungry to wait that night but based on the smell, the atmosphere, ambiance and the line of all ages and styles we vowed to be back.  Turns out our first experience would be the dine in sort rather take out. When I called I knew what I wanted...the * Puerto Penasco Carne Street Pie *...  { Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow } does that give you A N Y idea how GOOD it was? I was actually worried about the 'pesto' when really it should be labeled magic sauce.   The flavor was on point. I am a HUGE cilantro fan and there was the perfect amount on the whole pie plus the crust stayed the perfect crispness through transport!!! When does that even happen?!??  Last but not least, when I made my phone order, the person was spot ON with the wait time/ready time whatevs. I got there 10 mins early because I hate it when my food sits...whelp it was ready in exactly 40 minutes like she said.  Long story NOT short....E A T * H E R E !!!!  I will order take out again and I will definitely be having a dine in experience in the nearish future.  *cheers*

Went to my first spring training game which happened to be the first game of spring training for the Giants.   Went with a bunch of friends and sat on the lawn.   Atmosphere was great, beers spendy, and pretty decent views of the field from anywhere.   Only tip is if you really want to watch the game, get stadium seats....the people watching in the grass is insane and can totally monopolize your attention.   Oh and bathroom waits aren't bad ladies!!  //cheers//

Dear Grimaldi's,  I love you. My tummy loves you. My taste buds love you. My soul loves you.   Friends from Texas were visiting and they said you are suppose to be good...they had heard from co-workers and friends that you are the place to go when in the area. With this advice we give it a try their first night in town...and then again their third night in town.   I have never in my life had wine perfectly paired with pizza and with all of your flavors and goodness I crave you all the time. I can't wait to come back. The wait to get a table is average compared to neighboring restaurants and just really I can't wait to come back. I love you, and your pizza and your desert (THE SAMOA CHEESECAKE!!!!).   With love and affection,  Leah

The hubs and I visited Scottsdale for a long weekend (Thursday-Sunday) while apartment hunting and the Scottsdale Plaza Resort was our Priceline "unknown" hotel...and we were NOT disappointed. We were able to check-in early as our flight landed at 9:00am.  The bed was comfortable, bedding warm, AC worked like a charm, water pressure in the shower couldn't have been better and the water warmed up and stayed warm at all times. Who could ask for more????  Alright, so we also went to the lounge and had had appetizers and drinks one of the days. The kitchen was quick to get our food out and far tastier than expected. We  (the hubs and I) actually wish we would have eaten there sooner so we could have given it a second chance but we ran out of time.  To get to the center of Old Town it was less than a 10 minute drive and only a $10 Uber ride if that's important to you.   While we were here there was also a conference of some sort (a big conference) and we never felt in the way or annoyed. The logistics were great for guests who were not attendees.  Long story not short, we would stay here again (that is if we didn't move just up the road) as well as recommend it to friends/family.

{first visit} and I'm officially a *fan*   I will be back. And I haven't even closed out my tab.  Came down to watch the Portland Timbers play, munch on some tacos and get a beer.   Thanks Camillo for the recommendation!!!!   Thus far Loco Patron has served the best 'restaurant' tacos since I've been in Arizona, and trust the hubs and I are on a mission.   I ordered he steak and pork crunch tacos. You CAN'T go wrong. I also recommend the 'street taco' the salsa that comes on that...WOW...yes please, sign me up, I want!!!!!   The chips and guac is great too! They put fresh cilantro on the chips which allows the flavor to spread amongst the chips...seriously an awesome twist I've never experienced.   The tacos are great, the service is on point, music is engaging and if you need to watch a sporting event, there's enough TVs to go around.   // cheers //

I absolutely love this park!!!!!!! I've been twice now with my 8 pound Maltipoo, Stella and both times were absolutely great.   The hubs and I officially decided this park is a must at least once a week. The doggy water fountains, seats for humans and shade makes it a no brainer. Everyone is so friendly, they pig up after their dogs, they love any animal that demands their attention and frankly just nice! Oh and some people we talked to drive 40 minutes just to come to THIS park and claim it's the best in the state.   Sooooo.....During our first visit (last weekend) the 'passive' side was empty so the beast and I sauntered into the 'active' side and and I felt 200% at ease letting my little lady roam free and play. There were dogs of all ages and sizes and their humans were super friendly.   Visit two ((today)), both yards were open so we went into the 'active' side since Stella can be wild. Mostly the active yard was primarily full of bigger dogs, meaning 40+ pounds. After a bit we wandered over to the 'passive' side and really it was more of the smaller dogs ...mostly 10-15 pounders with a few 30+.

Why did I ever wait 3.5 months to experience Butterfields!?!?!! DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!  We got there around 9am on a random, hot Sunday {today}...the benches wedge full of people, standing room only! ...Wait for it......BUT WE ONLY HAD A 10 MINUTE WAIT {there were 4 of us}...how does that happen? 10 minutes and it was for real. We were seated and our waitress was there lickity split!   Tip #1...get the fresh squeezed juice. It's going to change your opinion on juice. It's the real deal.   We ordered a scramble and skillet and a side of pancakes {our friends said we couldn't be friends if we didn't get the pancakes} THANK GOODNESS we did. They were fluffy and moist and the right size for a side. They were 'normal person' size not giant size *phew*  Annnnnyway. Butterfields breakfast was delicious. Service was Quick and Friendly they are really great getting people seated without rushing people out he door.  We will definitely be back! Yum yum yum!

Decided today was the {D*A*Y} to finally visit Sweet Republic.   Visited with my dad and hubs and the deliciousness lived up to the hype. I went simple and ordered the buttery salted caramel and topped it with bacon brittle {yes Bacon Brittle!}. It was rich with the right amount of sweet and salty and the brittle wasn't too hard to begin with or after it was on top of my ice team for a little bit ...   The hubs ordered the Toffee Banofi and dad ordered the Campfire S'more. I'm personally not a banana lover but the hubs LOVED it and dad {the biggest ice cream lover in my life} went goo goo ga ga over the smore!!! I did too actually....I mean WHO WOULDNT GO NUTTY AFTER THEIR FIRST HOMEMADE *MARSHMALLOW*!?!?!?!?   Ok so yeah, they whipped up the Sundays lickity split (pun intended). There was ample seating and well...I'm sure we will see you again soon!!  //cheers//

The best...and I mean {*BEST*} margaritas and guacamole I've had in Scottsdale thus far.    I've visited twice, both on Saturday afternoons, and both times I had reservations and was thankful I thought ahead. I can't wait until their back patio has their liquor license again and will be lining up for that ambiance my fellow reviewers say is absolutely beautiful!   There so do many different occasions I would come here for...drinks at the bar, lite eats with friends, a special dinner, brunch...you name it The Mission is perfect for it.   You must get the table side guacamole, it's perfect. The brisket torta {with egg} was my favorite food so far. Their steak tacos and rock shrimp tacos are also delicious but the brisket was the meds winner for me....not sure what you want?? Too many good options? Your waiters will Not leave you astray with food for drinks.  Two visits, 5 Stars both times. I will be back. No question.

First off thank you fellow Yelpers for leading me here!!   So far I've been here twice and I will definitely be back...again...and again...and again! ((And again)) Both visits were for lunch, round one was a to go order of Al Pastor street tacos ** we will start here.   I walked in (the fancy shmancy wooden doors next to the Tienda) and it was jam packed. And this was around 2:30 on a weekday and it really is a little restaurant AND the character and ambiance are unique. So inviting. Anyway, I first attempted to order the Asada tacos...then mole however they were sold out .... Hence the al pastor. The flavors were amazing. They weren't (in my opinion) traditional, however they were delicious and I WILL order them again in the future.   My second visit was a sit down lunch around 1:00 on a Wednesday with the hubs. We were able to sit, eat, and relax before my one hour lunch was finished. So they are very quick!! The place got packed closer to 2:00 by people of all ages which is a really good sign. Anyway, I ordered the black mole tacos and the hubs got a trio street taco plate. *{Holy Moly}* Yelpers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Everything this restaurant serves could be considered magical bursts of flavors that rock your Mind!!!   Just come here and eat. The food is to die for. The salsa bar is something to be rivaled and their margaritas look heavenly (I need to go when I'm off the clock!!)  //cheers//

When my hubs said there's this place with bottomless mimosas and a live DJ on the weekends I was like, 'whaaaa????' Let's go!  I wasn't disappointed. The food blew me out of the water {I expected sub par} AND it was way above par! Like Birdie status good. I ordered the hash and the hubs got a boring regular egg breakfast and damn. I would eat breakfast there with or without that perk of bottomless mimosas!  I was there with a group of 5 and our service was Awesome...no joke. Rarely was a glass empty and everyone {our group and the whole restaurant} were in good spirits.   I'll def be back and will def bring out of town guests here!  //cheers//

**H O L Y * C O W**  A diamond in the rough. Photos of the inside don't do the ambiance and good vibe of this place justice! The restaurant was packed and the bar was full nearly the entire time we were there.  We enjoyed the winter menu...the hubs ordered the meatloaf and it was magical...I don't even LIKE meatloaf and I asked for multiple bites. So what did I order? The field salad small plate and acorn squash with goat cheese and chorizo. Don't get me wrong the entrees all looked delicious but I couldn't get past the 'small plate' menu. Two items were perfect for me.  The flavors of all of the dishes were perfect and extremely complementary of each other. I don't believe there would be a bad choice on the menu and can't wait to go a second time.  So, not only are we foodies, we love good craft cocktails and here, again CPH delivered.   When you are looking to indulge and want something outside if the box...you won't be disappointed with Citizen Public House.  Cheers!!

I'm new in town and don't know many people, but one of the few peeps that I do know, informed we would be going to coffee today AND it would be at Cartel Coffee Lab.  ...You could say I didn't have a choice...but then again I didn't object either  :-)  I have stumbled into a few local coffee shops in Scottsdale and also a few chains (no shame people) Cartel definitely gives it's competitors a run for their money.   When we walked in, the smell exactly what you'd hope if you love the smell of coffee. It smelt like ~Heaven~ and by heaven I mean roasted coffee beans. People were chatting, working or simply enjoying their beverage of choice (there's even beer and wine on tap!)--it was a very welcoming and relaxing vibe.  Ok so what did I order? My girlfriend said they make a great chai so I took her word for it but took it a step further...I ordered me a *dirty*chai (chai with a shot of espresso). and It was Perfect. If you love chai you know how important it is for it to not be too sweet and this had the perfect combo of spice, hint of espresso and creaminess!  It's sad to admit how much I loved Cartel Coffee Lab's brew and have to accept that it's out of the way to get on a regular basis but when I'm in the neighborhood I will definitely be stopping in to get my fix!  *cheers*

Are you KIDDING me? I order an extra hot 2 pump Classic latte (see image) and I get a latte with Chai flavoring instead??? The handwriting for the Order in my opinion, is clear, you be the judge...  At least service was fast. The woman who took my order was nice but the blonde 30-40 y/o with the ponytail making my coffee....shame on you.  I have been a Gold member since 2013 and Never in Many states, innumerable different locations have I ever experienced this faux pas.   Can I have my $4.51 back? I can respect a mistake but not something that is utterly disgusting.

Wasn't even looking for lunch but saw the sign when driving by that had {enchiladas and soup} on it....two of my favorite things...so if the hubs and I didn't stop we would hate ourselves later.  ********** Soooooooo Glad We Did *********  Walked in and here were probably 6 groups/tickets/parties of singles and multiples and the staff got them served lickity split! Kudos guys!  So it's a subway/chipotle style service which is amaze balls...but you know what?? It doesn't taste like it at ALL!!!!!! #winning :-)   So I went for the tacos and the hubs the red sauce enchiladas. Zero complaints or wishes to make it better. Oh also ordered chips/salsa/guac. First timer here, I refuse to live with regrets.   I don't think you could order anything bad or gross here. I will be back and getting lunch on work days and meals to go for the hubs for dinner.  It's just that good.  So why 4 stars? Customer service people. There were 3 guys and 2 ladies....Guys you were amazing and if it were just you, there would be 5 stars, you were on POINT...ladies you are the reason for 4 stars. Unfortunately you were both a bit rude to everyone in line and your facial expressions were even worse. Bad day? Fake it till you make it or get a different job.   //cheers//

Met up with some friends on a Saturday afternoon after adulting real hard and running errands all day.  Lets say I got there between 3:00-4:00 ... they were not packed by any means. We were there for drinks and socialization and for some reason, we were told we could not have a server and had to order our drinks at the bar...??  Alright, Party of 8, without a server at one of the tables along the sidewalk. Awesome.  After a few hours we decided we wanted some food...requested a server for that component...after 20 minutes of waiting, we decided it was time to close out our tabs and go elsewhere since asking one of the many young ladies chatting around the bar to take our orders was a bit too much work...As you can imagine closing 6 tabs (some of our party were couples) took another 20 minutes and finally when the last tab was being closed a server came over to the table...  If you are looking for country music and average drinks to sit on a given afternoon? Sure give it a whirl, the seats are comfy, the girls are nice to look at and the beer is cold.

{*Soooooo*} this was my second time here. First time was on a random Wednesday the very first night I moved to town and today (Sunday). Both times the restaurant was full which is a great sign!   Ok ok get to the important stuff, I get it! Jeeze!   Tonight's order was the Buffalo Bill (which had blue cheese, sassy sauce, hot sauce and bacon). It was delicious! It was suppose to come out medium-rare and it came out well done but it was still tasty and delicious. It had the perfect amount of the Good kind of blue cheese too!!!!   My hubs ordered the classic burger and added bacon and cheddar. His was cooked perfectly which made me a teensy bit jealous...  We shared fries....**YUUUUUMMMM** I love the soda selection with the real cane brand or whatever it's called and oh the Vanilla milkshake .......**droooooool**   But really, this place is delicious. Zero complaints. Awesome staff, great atmosphere, yummy and quick to table food.  *cheers*

I moved to Scottsdale with my husband and Maltipoo, Stella, at the beginning of February and before we even left Oregon, I found Lori's and scheduled Stella's next spa day thanks to my fellow Yelpers!!!!  Why did I initially choose Lori's? -Cage Free -Awesome Reviews -Photos of dogs who looked similar to mine which CUTE after photos  Why will Stella go back AND attend a future Doggy Day Care day? As soon as we walked in, Greg (Lori's husband) greeted Stella and while I completed her new client form, she got to know both Lori and Greg and I immediately felt comfortable leaving my furbaby in their hands!  When I picked Stella up later, they showed me a video of her playing with a fellow spa patron and again it was obvious how much they loved every single dog in their care!   The price for a full groom for my toy poodle/maltese hybrid was competitive at $45 and it was worth every penny...they even send you home with a little doggy bag of treats and goodies for your pup!!!!!!!!   Thank you for making me feel comfortable right away making sure Stella's poodle is under control!    *See you in 5 weeks*

Came in for an after dinner drink with another couple and bachelor.  The smell is magical...mmmm mmmm  We sat at the bar and the bartenders were absolutely AMAZING.  I apologize I can't remember your names, but you made our visit great. I had a simple glass of wine but the hubs had your old fashioned and he thought it was great (I did too and those usually aren't my cuppa tea)  You were fast, engaging and I can't wait to come back and enjoy the food! (and cocktails)

this is my first visit to the Scottsdale area and on our way in I saw the sign for a Mexican Asian restaurant!!! I pointed at it and my husband was like 'that looks interesting.  Let me say wow. We went to dinner with another couple and we ordered in the family style fashion  **my apologies for not taking photos!!**  Yes the prices are a bit shiny, but it's worth it. It's an experience worth having.   The small plates are actually small...big enough for 2 people, no more. The entree portions are definitely good for 3-4 people. And the kimchi fried rice is a MUST.  Be prepared to have a long experience so plan accordingly...that's the only negative. Waiting for the food.

{**Hey There**}  I met up with my hubs and another couple here on a random Sunday afternoon...around 3 or 4. Considering this place is off of a busy road I was surprised it wasn't busier!   We decided to sit at the bar (the best seat in the house) and our bartender was quick to greet us. She was extremely personable with us and the other bar patrons and you could tell the staff had a good rapport with each other. Lots of smiles, laughs, banter and productive all at the same time. **kudos guys**  Alright, so I ordered the guava coconut cocktail and wow. Wow wow wow. It's all things coconut and fresh and scrumptious and refreshing all at the same time! My party were lame and two of them ordered Coronas the entire time but again the waitress was spot on and kept them coming.  We shared an order of guacamole and salsa and all I can say is **Y U M** the food that they kept bringing out for everyone else smelled delicious AND looked amazing.   I can say that I will be back to try more of the liquid menu but also the food. Updates to be expected in the future.  *cheers*

I've been here three times ...  once Friday during happy hour, once Friday after happy hour {which ends at 7} and to watch the super bowl.   Compared to its neighbors, the crowd here is a bit more mature, relaxed and down to just have a good time rather than the goal to get s^*% faced.   Personally I appreciate the sports on TV and awesome music overhead all the while being able to play connect 4 or Jenga (huge boards)   The food is delicious (burgers all the way) and the servers do their best to keep up with the table service.   //cheers//

After a long week of work the hubs and I decided we needed something delicious in our bellies that didn't require us to cook after a long week of unpacking and work....soooo we came here!!   We had a 40 minute wait for a table and it was worth every minute. The staff was pleasant, the bartenders looked like they had some good banter going on with their patrons and oh the feeling and ambiance of this restaurant is so enthralling, timeless and so so welcoming.   The hubs and I decided to get a few small plates {**ORDER THE BRUSSLE SPROUTS**} and one entree to share...oh and wine and an old fashioned.   You guys...it was all so delicious, the flavors paired so nicely between the three plates we ordered ... And then the dessert!!! Ah just go and have an amazing meal at an amazing restaurant and just know you will leave extremely satisfied.

My husband and I came straight here from the airport to talk about our upcoming move to he area and establish our game plan for our housing search.   We ordered classic drinks, latte and a a vanilla latte, which were whipped up super quick..and the Perfect Temperature (this is a big deal to me)!!! Our drinks were rich, smooth and delicious.   One thing being Portlanders we were worried about finding a good LOCAL coffee shop and our worries are officially no more.  The staff are totally laid back, welcoming and the atmosphere and deco is perfect to relax and get whatever you need done.   Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for hyping up this gem!!!! They are right, don't let the plaza it is in divert you!

Let's be honest, i think this is my FIRST one star review ever. I have always looked at the 1 stars at a restaurant with great reviews and now I've learned my lesson. Every review matters.  My husband and I came on Valentine's Day and were pretty excited based on the pics and fellow Yelp reviews...we will not be back.   The wait was expected 30-40 minutes in our opinion was actually really really good considering the day and the area.   We were seated at the bar as the hostess asked if it was ok, which we were fine with, give a table to a family or someone under 21. No biggie.  My husband opted for the 'build your own' Bloody Mary bar and i opted for the house/bartender makes it for me Bloody Mary, it would have to be just as good if not better than his, right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Ok so the hubs makes his own drink and I literally wait 20 minutes for mine. Not kidding. Then finally when she brings me my drink she then takes our order....which doesn't come out for nearly 45 minutes. No apologies, no eye contact, no how's your drink, you haven't touched but I see you sipping off of your man's.  Ok so what was wrong with it? You know when the mix isn't stirred/shaken and the good stuff is all at the bottom? Yeah, I didn't get the good stuff or the garnishes.   Kudos to the blond bartender working the other side of the bar who checked on her waiting patrons and offered to comp a drink if they would like another while they waited. I wish you were our waitress because service is half of a review.   Our food was mediocre. I had the chicken and waffles which had absolutely no flavor...the hubs had the Boring Bennie and the biscuit instead of the English muffin was actually genius.  All in all the wait For food and poor service is what this review comes down too.   **DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR**
