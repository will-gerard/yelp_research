Awesome job Chandler pita jungle. about a week or so ago I called in an order and arrived about 15 minutes later and they couldn't find my food. The girl said she had but then it was gone... Had to wait. Tonight I called in my order and arrived 15 minutes later and there was a couple placing an order. I then paid for my order, then a young lady placed an order. As I waited an additional 15 minutes, the couple AND the young lady were given their orders. Finally I was given my order and when I asked why I received mine after both of them I was told, "our saute guy is really backed up." So I was angry at this excuse as it sounded ridiculous so I just took my order and left, figuring I would just not return to pita jungle, as this was the second time in a row your restaurant disappointed me. Then I arrived at home and when I opened my order, My sandwich was made incorrectly from how I ordered it. I called and of course the only solution to this is for ME to go back to the restaurant and have it replaced, however this was not an option since I had already spent more time than I wanted to get a quick dinner for my wife and I as we wanted to watch the Coyotes game while we ate. Based on these experiences, I will not return to Pita Jungle.  I thought I would update this review. I sent an email to the company and within 20 minutes, both the store director AND the operations director responded. It is customer service like this to show their concern that WILL bring me back to Pita Jungle in the future, especially since we really love the food.

For this review I would give NO stars if I could. I purchsed an office chair about 1 year or so ago and bought the extended warrantee. The chair broke so I filed a claim. I have been without an office chair since June 9th now because they run you through all sorts of hoops to get your money back to buy a new chair. Tomorrow will be one month and they just barely emailed me that they will issue the refund SOON!!! SERIOUSLY?!?!?! Shame on the warrantee company, shame on Staples for PUSHING the warrantee on you, and SHAME on staples for using such a lousy service.

this place is going down hill. This time I called my order in and they only made half of it, there were no kids for the condiment cups, the salsa bar was a mess, they had no napkins and the trashes were full to nearly over full. So much for ordering in advance so I could sit here and wait anyway and while one of my meals got cold. They should have made them both over again. A loyal customer rethinking his dinner choices.

So normally I don't write reviews if they are unfavorable but I feel the need on this one. My honda civic went into "limp" mode and when I tried to read the computer with my scanner it would not connect with the computer. I researched, asked a lot of questions of a lot of people, and used every resourse I could find, with no help. I figured my computer was dead. I have heard some bad things about HonTech but I have always been the type of person to give a fair shake. I called them up and they told me it would be $94 to diagnose the problem and we could go from there. I took the car down there and dropped it off. After several hours the next day (I had dropped it the night before) they called and told me my computer was dead and that they could not connect to the computer. This was the same thing I found on my scan. So I know for a fact that based on the fact the computer could not be read by their scanner, that what they did was hook it up, saw they could not connect, and disconnect. This entire process would have taken about 2 minutes and 11 seconds. So they, in fact, did NOT diagnose anything and spent almost no time, yet they still charged me the $94 and told me my scanner probably shorted out the computer. My scanner is a very expensive one and is not very old, AND I scan cars all the time and never had this issue with any other car. I feel like they ripped me off by charging me even though I KNOW they really did nothing. I would stay away from this business as they are thieves and have NO ethics in dealing with customers.

I've seen some negative reviews on this place so I thought I would write one since I run a business and know that getting 2 or 3 bad reviews out of some 20 to 30 thousand customers per month that you deal with like I do could be damaging. I phone shopped around for advise and pricing because my 2000 GMC Sierra had a good size dent in the aluminum drive shaft and I suspected it was causing the vibration I was experiencing since I had already replaced the rims AND tires. I took them the shaft and because my truck is a 4X4 they suggested I go with steel instead of aluminum and it would actually cost about 5 bucks less. I left them the drive shaft on wednesday at about 12:30 and was told they usually get about a 24 hour turnaround. The time was fine so I left them the shaft. I went home and went to sleep because I had been up for about 35 hours straight because of having an inventory at work. When I woke up at about 5:30 later that day, I had a message that my drive shaft was done and that they closed at 5:30 if I wanted to get it before then. Well obviously I picked it up the next day and now that it is in, my truck even with its 185,000 miles on it, rides as smooth as glass. These guys might come across a little rough but THEY ARE WORKIN GUYS!!! Sure they don't use a lot of yes mam's and yes sir's when they talk to you, they just talk to you... Kind of matter of fact. They are very cool in my book since I don't like a bunch of BS anyway. If you need something done that they do, deal with the fact that they are just real people and take your stuff there. They took great care of me and I know they will take great care of you.

Super Star Carwash treats me just as that, a Super Star!!! They do a great job every time and have so much to offer from the Dunkin Donuts to the free computers, wi-fi, and television with big comfortable chairs. A great place to hang out while my car gets cleaned!

I went here last night during the Motorcycles on Main event that happens the first Friday of every month. Normally I like this place a lot but on these nights, be prepared to wait a bit. I don't think they have enough people working for them all the time to cover these nights like last night. But I won't penalize them for this since its once a month and wouldn't be fair to expect a business to maintain extra staff all the time based on one night. But the food is good and consistent and they try their hardest to be friendly even when dealing with all the people on first Friday especially all the bikers. Check em out, but make your first time at a different time then the first Friday evening of the month.  Update: I was telling some friends about this experience and it reminded me of something that caused me to change my review from 4 stars to 5. Even with as busy as they were, the food presentation was very impressive. My wife ordered a full order (10) of honey hot wings. The wings came on a sushi style platter, long and not very wide, and they were nicely stacked on one end with the dipping sauce was at the other end. then the wings were drizzled in an opposite pattern with both the buffalo sauce and the honey sauce. I just thought that was going the extra mile to make the food look as good as it tastes.

The food is OK bar food but if you are a Chicago sports fan you HAVE to check out this place. Everything Chicago, and the people are rowdy and fun, even if you are rooting for the other team. My wife and I went here to watch the bruins because they were our second team (after the yotes) but have been converted to Blackhawk fans instead. The songs they play between periods have new lyrics to promote the Chicago team playing that night and there are bunches of TV's to watch the game. Five stars for atmosphere and fun!

This is tough for me as they are still my provider but it is what it is. Don;t get me wrong, every time I get in to see one of the doctors or practitioners, I like the service I get from them. They are straight to the point and honest. But the front office staff? Either get a better organizational tool or ASK FOR HELP!!! I was in the office today for my appointment. Yes there were other patients but not many, considering some were there to see a doctor and some were there for the lab. Yet when I called about 5 minutes after I left to see if they had called in my scripts, I was on hold for just over 9 minutes but had to hang up. Then about 15 to 20 minutes later, I called again and yet again I was on hold, but this time for just over 31 minutes... Seriously? I only stayed on hold that long because I really needed the information. Its sad, but I am going to have to search out a new providers office after being with either this office or the office of the doctor who merged with them for going on 17 years. I would post the screenshot of my call screen showing the 31:30 time on the call if I had that option

After receiving very poor service at another restaraunt (never got help for 18 minutes after being seated) my buddies and I ride out to Mill and ended up stopping at Fuzzy's Tacos. it was fast, the people working were very friendly and nice, and the shredded brisket tacos were amazing! I don't think I would go on a weekend because of how busy it would be but my wife and I DID go the very next night. Awesome and highly recommended.

easily one of the most ridiculous setups I've ever seen. if you are going to have merchandise on the sales floor for customers to pick up and take to the register to pay, then have a cashier available to accept their payment. making someone wait in a long line when they are ready to pay is exactly why you lost my business today. This company has no regard for the customer. I would like to say they put their employees first but based on the miserable look on all their faces, that's not the case here either. Exactly why I shop mostly on line.

My wife and I have multiple Harleys, and even though I like to do most of my own work, I sometimes need some help. The nice thing about this place is that if you can't do it yourself, Michael and his staff will take great care of you and give you a fair and affordable price on the work they do. If you prefer to do it yourself, they will rent you a lift and let you use their tools for a nominal fee, and I mean cheap. They recently added an exhaust, air cleaner, and tuner to my wife's Nightster and it sounds and runs AWESOME! I was told about this place by a friend of Michael's and tried them out. I have been coming here ever since and I have noticed that they treat every customer like family. If you need anything done do any year, make or model, Headkace is the place to go. I highly recommend them.

I really anticipated this place but was left a little eh. No real seasoning on the burger, the bacon had no flavor, and even the thousand island dressing was unnoticeable. The chips were OK and at least the fries were hot but the prices are a little inflated for nearly no flavor and a little cup of fries. I give a star because of all the TV's and an extra Star because, what can you expect from a sports bar? But then I have to remove a star because when my wife went to cut her burger in half, there was a dried up, chewed piece of gum on the handle. The waitress acted concerned but no apologies from a manager. I guess quality control is not a concern here.

Wow, at least 10 people in every line... Oh did I mention they only have like 4 lines and the self checks open? And the self checks are down the isle. 2 stars because of price, minus 3 stars because they just don't care about service
