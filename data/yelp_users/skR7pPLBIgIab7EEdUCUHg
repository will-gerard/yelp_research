This place is a staple of I-17, or Arizona for that matter. They have the best pie I've had for decades! So far I've tried the chocolate pie l, key lime, cherry, blackberry, jack Daniels pecan, and a couple others I'm forgetting I'm sure and have yet to be disappointed! This is a definite must see and eat destination if you're new to the Phoenix area!

What a great tobacco shop! Really relaxed atmosphere and the staff isn't right on top of you to try and steamroll a sale out of you like many I've been to before. Really friendly and relaxed atmosphere with a surprisingly large selection. Upscale feel to the whole place and you can tell the owner cares about the experience not just making a quick sale and getting you out. Large leather chairs and free wifi if you ask probably one of the best cigar shops I've been to!

The ambiance of this place would be perfect for a date night or a get together where it is possible to have a conversation. Definitely has an upscale feel but without being pretentious. They take reservations and I would definitely make another one! The food was great and the wait staff all seemed to really enjoy their work, not a single bitter Waffle House waitress in the place. Lots of unique flavors and the Mac and cheese is a must!

Came here with a friend not knowing what to expect. It was in one word; hip. I had a sazerac and the jalapeno bacon mac'n'cheese both of which were fantastic. The atmosphere is very chill and it was easy to find an area to suit your interests. The service was helpful and friendly and overall was a great experience! Definitely worth checking out if you're anywhere nearby.

Everything I have had here was excellent! The service was helpful and friendly and my glass was never empty. It looks so unassuming from the curb, if you didn't know better you'd think it was just another come and go strip mall restaurant but this is probably the best Italian I've had in east valley!

First time I came here was at the peak of snowbird season so I chalked it up to that. This is my second visit and I realize it was not.   I ordered a jalape√±o bagel with bacon and cheese. The bagel I got was clearly sliced with the same knife they use to chop onions all day judging by the flavor left threw the bagel and the fact that it had little purple pieces of onions randomly. The bagel itself seemed to be of the exact quality I have purchased at local grocers.   The front counter girl was not friendly or welcoming in the slightest and to be put mildly was very inappropriately dressed to be working near/with food. I don't know what everyone sees in this place other than not having to personally use a toaster there is no justifiable reason to ever patronage this "cafe."

This place is a hidden gem. I had the jack Daniel's BBQ chicken and it was fantastic! Not to mention the amazing outdoor section. Not really a draw in the summers but in the winter time they have fire pits at each table. You're allowed to get as much wood as you want by the box full yourself and build a fire. They even sell s'mores kits for the kids, big and little. They normally have a live band on the weekends when I've been and even mid week at off hours this place is always packed. Definitely a must if you're in the east valley. I have taken a lot of out of town visitors out here too with rave reviews!

This place is awesome! The first time I came here was for an early dinner late lunch and the staff was great even though they were between the rushes, everyone seems like they really enjoy their jobs which always makes a huge difference. The Italian nachos are fantastic and if you come in late the "bar specials" after 10pm are a steal!

If you haven't been to a chipotle you should. And if you're looking for a good one try this one! The staff has always been top notch and the food prepared exactly to specs. The times I have put in online orders they were always on time and the one time that it wasn't they gave me a free drink while I waited! The manager and employees all seem to enjoy their work and that always shows in a meal. Nothing but good things to say about this place!

I called this business to get an estimate on a garage opener repair. The man who answered the phone was very polite and patient with me considering I didn't even know the exact model of my garage door opener. He gave me a ball park estimate without any hesitation or attempt to pad the cost of the repair. We had scheduled the repair but when I got off work early I thought I would try calling him and he was nice enough to work around my schedule and show up early as he was wrapping up a job early as well. When he got to my home he thanked me for the opportunity to do the job you really don't expect to see that level of customer service from a "repair man" these days. He was very cordial and answered any questions I had along the way. When he finished the job he charged me exactly what we had quoted me with no surprises and gave me his card because they stand behind their work. This was probably the best repair service I have ever recieved no surprises no hidden costs just good honest work from a real stand uup guy.

Tried ordering breakfast in the drive thru. When I asked the kid for a "croissant breakfast sandwich" he said "I can't hear you." Then I spoke a little louder and said "croissant breakfast sandwich" and the kid responded " a breakfast sandwich with the softest of bread?" This miscommunication went back-and-forth another three times. This is the second time I've had a problem with this place long ago I tried getting breakfast here and it wasn't very good I had coupons that came in the mail sent but those coupons weren't honored when I got to the window.  The kid took the coupons from me but then after he took my credit card as well he did nothing about the coupons I'm assuming just threw them away and charge the full amount to my credit card by the time I realized it was pulling out of the drive through I was irritated. I called the manager and they assured me that they would make it right but they never did even after I went through the trouble of getting them all the information off of my receipt and now after trying to give them a second chance I see no option but to leave this terrible review.  Don't go here.

Best ice cream in Scottsdale! Worth going out of your way for the stop, and with tons of history to read up on displayed you can definitely make a memory or two here. The staff has always been perfectly friendly and pleasant no matter how many samples I asked to try haha!

Don't order online. I made the mistake thinking it would save me time but I showed up when at the pickup time it showed online which was about 25 mins from the time of order and then sat over 15 mins longer in the dinning area because it seemed no one had even started on my order. If I hadn't of paid online I would've walked out. And then when I spoke to the manager on the phone after I left she just told me she would address it with the staff and was not very apologetic at all. I've enjoyed driving through this place many times but I wont be fooled again.

This place was fantastic what a hidden gem! Got off work a little later than normal and made it in less than a hour before closing and everything was still fresh! The wait staff was courteous and professional and made us feel welcome. The decor inside was all done up for the approaching holiday. I can't think of anything bad to say about this place! I will definitely be returning!

This place puts any of those big name sandwich places to shame! So many choices and the overall tongue n cheek humor of the place will keep you coming back every time you're close and sometimes when you're not! Don't let any of the kitsch fool you though this is a gourmet level of sandwich artisans putting together your meal here!
