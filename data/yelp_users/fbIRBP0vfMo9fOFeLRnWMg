Royal Palms - such memories!  My wedding reception was at Royal Palms almost 10 years ago...if I could have Yelped then it would have definitely been 5 Stars.  Have stayed many times over the years and have always enjoyed returning to this special place...I would classify all as 4-5 star caliber visits.  The property remains beautiful and the location can't be beat.  Most recently returned for my wife's birthday this past weekend.  It was once again a terrific weekend, but there's clearly room for improvement.  Pro: 1. Beautiful property - perfect location 2. Great room (designer casita #118) 3. Good service 4. "Surprise" birthday dessert in room was a nice touch  Con: 1. Time to jazz up the pool area: one poor server running around like a chicken sans head does not make for a relaxing environment...and the little shack of a bar does not exude opulence.  Try to be more like a miniature version of the Scottsdale Four Seasons Pool area. 2. T'Cookes has not recaptured it's mojo from the glory years gone by - good service and food, but it used to be head and shoulders above typical resort fare.  (this could be another review if I had time).   3. They ran out of souvineer coffee mugs - this in and of itself is no big deal, in fact they gave us a token discount on a set removed from a room.  This would have been much more appreciated if we didn't find coffee residue in the mugs when we got home.  Not the end of the world, but annoying nevertheless.   4. $25 "Resort Fee" is irritating.  These nickel-dime charges and fees everywhere you turn these days are really getting out-of-control.  I'd rather pay the advertised price and take care of my own tips and such.    Overall, I'd say 3.5...rounding down in this case.  ************************** 8/24: Updating from original 3 star level.  After reflecting on all the hapiness that Royal Palms has brought into my life, I just can't leave this as 3 stars.  The place deserves four...kind of like a lifetime achievement award.  I wrote the original review the day after consuming 4 lemon drops by the RP pool, a Boodles martini and an Anchor Steam at the Jade bar, wine and Irish Coffee at dinner at T'Cooks, a bottle of Champagne in the room, and a bloody mary and another anchor steam at brunch the next morning at Dick's Hideaway.  My liver may have weighed in with 3 stars, but the resort really deserves 4.

Annual staycation for wife's birthday.  This place still sets the bar for local resorts. Great pool with added bonus of a cabana without any extra charge.  The bartender made the killer lemon drops that we grew attached to on a previous visit, even though they are gone from the drink menu. Just great service and a nice resort trying to fit into a beautiful landscape as gracefully as possible.

Ahh Ted's...where to begin.  For me it all started on a warm August day in the late eighties.  I was heading north from Tucson to start my undergrad career at ASU and the friend I was following drove straight to Ted's instead of Manzanita (Spanish for "tall ugly dorm with many drunk kids").  Thus began a love affair that only grows stronger to this day.  Footlong Chili Dogs got me through a lot of hangovers and somewhere along the way college came and went, grunge came and went and my mullet came and went.  Then after college it was the All Beef Jumbo that got me through the trials and tribulations of being young, single, and semi-gainfully employed -- a few less hangovers, but still plenty of nitrates.  Then as a slightly older family man the White Hot has emerged as the sausage of choice for weekend trips with the Toddlers.  I even purchased my most recent residence perhaps partially because Spiro (the owner and son of "The Ted") lives across the street (ok - so maybe not the best approach to real estate decisions, but clealy Hot Dog obsessions can't be blamed for the entire real estate bubble).  This place is one of the last old school ASU spots and I pray that Spiro has a succession plan in place if he ever decides to retire.  Update: It just occured to me that this posting could be a bit more "review-ish" and a bit less autobiographical, so here goes.  All the aftermentioned dogs are awesome.  The condiments are perfect...the mustard and "hot sauce" are proprietary and worth purchasing in jars to take home (the white hot with mustard, hot sauce, onions, and a pickel is as good as it gets).  The Chili is ideally matched with cheese and onions on the regular, footlong, and all beef jumbo.  The onion rings are the best in town.  The only complaint I have is the liquid cheese, but I've come to accept and even appreciate it a bit over the years.  The milkshakes are good, but a bit small for the price.  There...hopefully that's enough superlatives.  Get there before noon to avoid the lines.

Terrific pizza for over 20 years from a really nice Chicago family. For those of you from the Windy City, think Home Run Inn (the original S. Side location).  The crust is they key...it's perfect -- thin and almost pastry-like. This crust and other fresh ingredients more than offset the slightly too sweet sauce and use of canned mushrooms.  One of the top 5 pizzas in the valley!

This place is great.  The owner must be my age, because I would swear that my exact record collection from high school is on the walls as decoration.  I love that you can bring your kids here and watch the game out of the corner of your eye, in an environment that is totally kid friendly. The food is really good. I like the hand ground burgers and the cheese steak and my kids think the chicken tenders rock.  They have a couple good Odell beers on tap, which doesn't hurt. It used to be nestled between a great book store (Changing Hands) and a great record store, but alas the record store went out of business.  Glad Changing Hands is prospering here since moving off Mill Ave way back when.  Nice work Mac, wherever you are.

This place used to be better. Seems like they've lost their mojo over the past few years. Last night the service was ok, but the vibe was not warm and welcoming. I am trying to put my finger on what's changed with the pizza...I think the crust used to be thinner. On the plus side, the pizza sauce is good and the crumbled Italian sausage is tasty. The beer selection is trapped in the 1990's...time to drop the Fat Tire (or better yet drop the domestic swill) and add an IPA. We should have dined on the patio, because it smells funny in there.

I don't think I've ever complained about price in a review, but $12.54 for a fast food cheeseburger, fries, and a medium drink?  The burger was ok and the fries were pretty good. Probably won't be back. Too many better choices out there (Lobby's, Zipps, Macs, 4Peaks, and of course the greatest of all The Chuck Box).

Ginban has become our go-to family sushi spot in A-town...it's excellent...only thing holding this pace back is inconsistent service.   The place is modern and stylish, especially considering the strip mall location.  The sushi bar is attractive and functional. There are TVs strategically placed around the restaurant, which is perfect if you want to catch snippets of the Blackhawks playoff match out of the corner of your eye while pretending to give your family your full attention.   The food is outstanding. The salmon sashimi is fresh and delicious and the yellowtail is among the best I've tasted.  I'm not a big roll fan, but the family really likes theirs; especially the Tiger Roll and the Eel Avocado roll.  The Unagi is really good as well. I've also tried the chicken teriyaki, which was good and tastefully presented but not life-changing.   The beer selection is just fine. The usual Japanese staples plus one or two nice surprises (Dog Fish Head 60 Minute IPA, I think!). Could be served colder, but whatever.   I get that handcrafted sushi can take a while, but they need to get it together.  Orders come out at odd times, like last night all three courses of my dinner were served long before the rest of the family received even their first morsel  of delicious raw fish.  There is also the occasional mistake, like the time we received ahi sashimi instead of salmon, but these things happen. One thing that would really help would be if the servers could kick up their attentiveness. They always avoid you like you've got SARS during these awkward long waits.  Invariably we want another beer or to add to our sushi order, but there is no one to be found...or even anyone willing to make eye-contact!  Of course, during a grown-up dinner with epic quantities of sake bombers they should take their sweet-damn-time bringing the fish.   Ultimately, we still love this place despite its flaws. The sushi is worth the wait and we have resolved to plan ahead more, but a little better service would mean a lot regardless.
