I've never paid so much to be so disappointed in my life.  This was my dad's Christmas present this year. It's ALL he wanted. After we showed up for our RESERVATION we waited another 10 minutes. We were sat on a very busy night, and I'm trying to keep that in mind. Our female server had little to no interest in serving us - intent on keeping an eye on all her tables. She wouldn't even look us in the eye. Never. Made. Eye contact. My dad is REALLY hard of hearing and asked her to repeat herself. She actually got exasperated. Like...huffed. I'm sorry - look around. That's your clientele. People can't hear. Especially on a busy night.  We ordered, and felt supremely RUSHED. Our dishes were constantly being taken away from us before we were even finished. I ordered the Mahi Mahi, the nights "special" - I swear I have seen the exact same dish at Bangle Barbeque in Disneyland. And paid about $15 LESS.   It's pretty sad that the best thing I had that night was the free liver pate. That stuff was amazing. So...yay liver.  We ordered drinks, appetizers, and desserts READ - $$$ - and yet all our server was looking at were the more expensive LOOKING tables. Older gents in suits. Not a family.   Now, I'm aware this is mostly about the server - but isn't that the face of a restaurant? I had a HORRIBLE time - the server severely negatively impacted our entire meal. It was my last weekend visiting my folks. It was awful.  After we paid, we actually went into the bar - hoping to not feel so rushed and relax with each other a little while. It almost felt like it was something the management told everyone to do: servers, bussers, runners - everyone was RUSHING. There was no time to enjoy anything.  Well, the BAR was an entirely different story. We had a GREAT time, stayed a couple hours! Didn't feel rushed, patrons were happy and everyone was having a great time, as was the bartender! I noted to myself that if I HAPPEN to ever come back, I will sit in the bar. It made a horrible night, sting a bit less.  The place is good for sports fans I guess and people in a hurry - or who have money to intimidate, but if you're looking for a great meal, and an enjoyable time, save your money and dignity. Go elsewhere. Except the bar. You can go to the bar.

We eat here every time we come home.  AMAZING, SUPERB, authentic food. WONDERFUL ambiance. BEAUTIFUL plating. You CANNOT order something bad here. THE BEST tiramisu. PERIOD.  We got married in the back room. Not even kidding. THIS is how much we love this place.

Oh man. I can't say enough good about  VinciTorio's.  So, they ADDED a new section - they expanded into the next space, added a BEAUTIFUL wine bar as well as some really neat Italian family style dining tables. There's also a huge new bookshelf full of beautiful bobbles, shiny trinkets, wine accessories, apparel, and goodies for purchase. GREAT prices too!  We went right after Christmas, I had the Seafood special that night. I'm gluten intolerant, and they offered rice noodles, but  I opted for broccoli instead. The chef wanted me to know that the sauce was MADE for noodles, he wasn't sure how it would be with broccoli, and I was OK with it. BROCCOLI FOR THE WIN. It was so stinkin good. Beautiful scallops - perfectly cooked, crab, shrimp and mussels in a creamy, not too thick white sauce. SO good. Oi. Ate it all. ALL.  My family had Tortellini Aurora, Stromboli (HUGE OMG), and Cecatelli. Every meal was completely finished and many "oommm's" and "hummmmm's". 2 bottles of house Merlot complemented all our meals. Everyone loved and ate all the bread. (Save me. Duh.)  Augie was there. If you HAVEN'T been and DON'T know who Augie is, go. Sit. Listen. Fall in love. With food. With your partner. With the wine. With comfort. Just fall in love...and thank me later.
