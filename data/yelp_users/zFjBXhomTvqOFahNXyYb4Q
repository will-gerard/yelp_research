After getting in touch with David, their Vice President I was able to schedule some repairs after he agreed the work wasn't up to professional standards. Unfortunately Mike, the one who originally did the subpar work, was the one who would be doing the repairs. Well, after taking off a Friday afternoon to meet them, Mike spent about 4 hours basically making things worse, then left without letting me know, and left my garage door wide open in a busy neighborhood. At this point I was livid and gave Dave(their VP) a call. He once again agreed, and asked if they could have one more chance to make things right. I told him I'd be happy to give them another chance provided Mike comes nowhere near my house ever again. So the following Monday, we scheduled Kevin. Man, what a difference, I immediately sensed his professionalism. He took one look at the prior work and shook his head. He then asked if he could basically start from scratch and do things correctly...I gave and enthusiastic "yes!". Fast forward 3 hours and Kevin's work was fantastic. Straight pipe runs, clean joints, routing that made sense. All in all, while I wouldn't let Mike anywhere near anything I own ever again, I do trust Smith Plumbing to do what's right when problems arise, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend Kevin.

I'm a fan of Scottsdale Gun Club. Despite the reputation, I actually think they're prices are very reasonable, both for rentals and ammo. My girlfriend just purchased a Springfield XDm after shopping around a bit and finding SCG to have the best price. Range ammo is very reasonable too. Their "no-name" .40 S&W brass runs 18.99/box(50), which is cheaper than Big 5 across the street, while their range 5.56mm runs $19.99/box(50), which is actually cheap.  I did drop one star because, like others have said, their range check-in/out staff can be rude. Today for example, we rented a SCAR-S(great gun BTW). When I turned it back in, I forgot to leave the slide locked open. This was met with a condescending "yeah, next time, don't leave the bolt like this" from Jackson. I'm not even sure this kid was out of high school. The last thing I need when going shooting is to get tude' from some dude who looks like puberty is still a few years away.  So yeah, give SGC a try. Just don't take any dirty looks from the check in staff personally, or, if you're feeling froggy, give one right back.

Terrible, this is just about the worst Mexican I've had in AZ. And that includes Taco Bell. Granted, standards for anything Latin are pretty high in Phoenix, but I couldn't imagine people would enjoy this place no matter where they're from. My company orders lunch here from time to time, so I'm forced to eat it or *gasp* pay for my own lunch. Yet this is the one place we order from that I actually consider sitting out for. The portions are tiny, it's kinda expensive and the small amount of food you do get is bland and gross. There are so many good Mexican restaurants in the Valley, don't waste your time.

I'm not a huge fan of the North Scottsdale Lifetime Fitness. In fact, I believe the only reason they stay so busy is the fact there really aren't any other options in the 101/Scottsdale Rd. area. But just today, I ended up leaving out of frustration because there was a wait on literally everything machine I had planned on using.  Pros: 1. They have every type of workout equipment imaginable(this is also a con, more on that later). 2. They are open 24/7 3. The locker room/saunas are very nice 4. Indoor lap pool  Cons: 1. WAY too crowded. Especially the strength training area. The sad thing is that it's certainly not for lack of space. It's due to being a poorly laid out facility. They have a massive  cardio area. So big that even during peak times maybe 50% of the treadmills/ellipticals are being used. Meanwhile there is almost always a wait for any resistance equipment. I believe this is also due to poor design. When I said the variety of equipment is also a con, it's because there are all sorts of machines that never get used, when there should be multiple copies of the most frequently used equipment. 2. The weight area is always a complete mess. Dumbbells just lying in the middle of the floor, towels strewn about, plates incorrectly racked. Meanwhile, there are always plenty of trainers standing around doing nothing. Maybe they could help keep the place tidy? 3. I can't put my finger on it, but there is this smug attitude from all the employees. You almost get the impression that they feel like they're doing you a favor by letting you work out there.  All in all, this place is just another Globo-gym. And, as everyone knows, you can't put lipstick on a pig, but for $160 a month, you certainly feel like you're paying for the attempt.

Contrary to the way I shop normally(looking at reviews and calling around), I chose Airpark Tint based on availability. I'm pretty glad I did. The work looks very nice and the price was good. They did the work very quickly as well. My Volvo S60 was done in about an hour and a half while I waited, so it was nice not having to drop my car off and arrange a ride. They do lose 1 star for one issue I had though: The tint I thought I purchased was not actually what was put on my car. Prior to purchase I had researched the longevity and more importantly the UVA/UVB resistance of certain films. So I had a pretty good idea of specifically what I wanted when I went it. When I arrived, I was shown two grades of Suntek film and 1 grade of Llumar film. Knowing both product lines, I went with the Llumar film. So, when the warranty card was filled out for Suntek I was confused. I inquired as to why he was filling out a warranty card for Suntek when I purchased Llumar film. He told me that it was like Reebok/Nike and I wouldn't know the difference. To his credit, he's probably right, and most people don't care what brand of tint was used on their car. Ultimately, I'm happy with the product used and the price was good, but did feel a bit mislead during the buying process.

I'm a big fan of AOS. My girlfriend and I did our open water certification here after purchasing a Groupon. As I understand it, Groupon keeps half the money. So for about $200(after Groupon's fees) for both of us, we got all classes, materials and check dives. That's really a stellar deal considering how much time/effort it takes to certify someone. It also means that AOS probably doesn't make much money on the deal. Despite this, we were treated exceptionally well by Kevin, our classroom and open water instructor. We're looking forward to booking a scuba trip with them in the furture, and are happy to give them future business based on our past experience.  P.S. I'm a member of their virtual dive club on Facebook, all the admins are super helpful and very quick to answer any Scuba related questions.

I really quite like this place. The food is outstanding for being a quick serve place and the staff is always friendly. Has a "doesnt seem like Phoenix" vibe which I dig. Hope it sticks around.
