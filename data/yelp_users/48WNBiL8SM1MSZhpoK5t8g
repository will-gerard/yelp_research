the food was well prepared, the service was nice. Pros. Location, food flavors, servers.  Cons. THe service was a little slow.  SInce the original reivew of this place I have returned and found that I like this place more each time I do. The Food has stayed the same, well prepared, tastey. The service is slow, however I have since learned that this place does something special, they employ the challenged anad give them an opportunity that others may not. The staff is always VERY friendly. I will continue to return there.

this was an attempt at an old tyme eatery.  Pros. They have a nive gift shop.  Cons. the food was cold, the servers were less then attentive, the prices were way out of wack.   For  chain style restaraunt they should have had it down. Dont expect to see me there again.

We have been here several times. We always enjoys the wings, the Texas toothpicks are very good. The service is what I would expect from a sports bar. If I had to pick a Con I would say it is the skimpy tops the waitress' wear.

"I don't know I just work here" should sum up the service given at border line. This was the answer I got to a question from the one and only employee we could find in the restaurant. She was impatient with taking our order.

Ok some hole in a wall places are worth taking a peak. This would be one. The one in Casa Grande and the one in Arizona City are very good.  Pros. As close to authentic as a Gringo like myself wants to get. Great quality, Large portions, and the flavors are well balanced.  Cons. Casa Grande has out door seating only, which means if its hot or cold so are you. Arizona City its an half hour drive.

Its a pizza hut what do you expect. Alot more than was delivered here. We had a party of 12 and there were 2 slices of pizza on the buffet line. The pizza was typical pizza chain fair.

This place is death on a plate. The buffet served like warm food. The hibachi raw meats were warm and slimy. The manager just shrugged his shoulders and said ah well. I then puked in the parking lot. NASTIEST PLACE EVER!

Ordered my lunch today for 2 adults and 2 kids. All the food was cold and didn't arive for 40 minutes. The wife sandwich which was supposed to be a cool sandwich had melted cheese and dried out bread fromt sitting under the warming lamp too long. My salad had cold fried chicken on it, and the kids mac 'n cheese was below room temperature. The only thing good there was the soda which is hard to screw up. Don't waste your time.

We have been here many times and as the previous reviews have stated. The service is lacking in most areas. However there one bright light in this otherwise abismal restaraunt chain. The server Theresa. We will eat there now only if she is our waitress. She understands customer service, and what a patron is looking for when eating out.

The best breakfast joint in town. I stumbled onto this place a week ago by accident. it is a very small place maybe 12 tables at best. I went back a week later. I would recommend the breakfast special. Its 2.95 and changes whats offers each week. Last week was the breakfast tacos they looked awesome. This week was a breakfast sandwich with eggs, ham, potatoes, and cheese it was awesome. I could barely finish it. The service was awesome both times. I found out that the same people own this place as well as borderline.

The service here very rarely matches the quality of the food. I understand I'm here for the food ultimately however I could always cook it myself and not bother with the rude and overall poor service. WOW, now at the end of the meal we find out the credit/debit card machine isn't working. Sounds like breakfast is free as long as we don't come back. Their solutions were walk up the road to an atm or don't come back. We opt'd to not go back. So after years of coming here we have at least for now chosen to swear off Big House Cafe and  Red Estillo Mex which are owned by the same company. As a struggling agoraphobic who hasn't left the house in a month they absolutely ruined my one day I could get out.

I will be back! That being said here are the Pros and Cons.  Pros:The croquettes are awesome, they come with a Cilantro dipping sauce that was wonderful. We shared the flat iron steak with Onions, and a side dish of black beans and rice. The food tasted good, the steak was cooked very well. When we walked in it felt as though we had arrived at a friends house who we hadn't seen for a long time. The experience was wonderful.   Cons: The steak and bean dishes both needed salt. The steak while well cooked could have used a nice char. It had the texture of a steamed steak with little carmalization.   I will be back if for nothing more than the croquettes. I cant wait to try more of the dishes.

For a BBQ/Pork shop the pork was dry and Nasty. You got no choice of what sauce they put on your ribs. The service was worse than the pork. At one point there were no employees where a customer could find them. My wife had to go get her own silverware. The only good thing I had here were the chicken wings. For a pork shop really. There are better choice near by.

Why is it that no matter how many times I let JJ's know of problems at this store the only response is to send me a gift card. Now I appreciate a free lunch but I REALLY appreciate my order being made correctly. Freaky Fast how about THIS store work on getting it freaking right.

I would again after 2 days of repeated problems warn all busy professionals or anyone who wants to partake of the freaky fast and freaky horrific service of jimmy johns to stay AWAY. The food is fine but beware that you will not get what you order. You will however get attitude, and poor service FREAKY FAST.

Not the best first experience. The order was wrong which I don't understand they only have 4 items on the menu. The Texas toast was soggy.
