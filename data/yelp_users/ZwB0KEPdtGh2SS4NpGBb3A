What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? I love their Sicilian style pizza. All I've had here are their pizzas, usually the super 6 or Hawaiian &  their house salad. I love a thick crust pizza so of course I love theirs. The sauce is a little sweeter than most, but not anything overwhelming or a turn off. I've picked I pizza & ate there & the quality is the same for both. This is going to run a little more than Barros or some other local spots, but it is well worth it!

Went here last night for the first time with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday. I would suggest making a reservation, because the place is small. I do appreciate that the restaurant is enclosed, because it is right off the casino floor & I would not have enjoyed the smoke while trying to eat.   My boyfriend & I both has the NY strip with a salad appetizer, I had the wedge (which is their house salad). The bacon on top looked extremely cheap, I kept calling it Subway bacon, because it looks like the type of cheap bacon Subway would have. The dressing was a blue cheese bacon which was good, but the lack of quality bacon was a little off putting. My boyfriend liked his Caesar & had no complaints. Also we both has drinks, I had a house wine (under $6 a glass) & he has an amber bock (under $5 a glass), so those prices were great.  They forgot to bring the bread everyone raves about. When we asked out waitress about it she apologized & it was brought out ASAP. The bread was okay. Next our meals, the steak was really good & cooked per my medium rare request. The sides, broccolini & mashed potatoes were both good as well.  Overall I would return & recommend it to others. Great meal at a good price with attentive & friendly service.

I love this place! I see Heather & I have been seeing her for a little over a year. I have cystic acne and she has done a great job of helping me improve my skin. Heather really takes the time to listen and look at things from a holistic approach, taking into consideration all of your medical history. Heather is a complete perfectionist and when dealing with the skin that is what you want.  She also takes into consideration cost and freely gives out samples and coupons (I have found that you can just call the office & ask if they have coupons available and they will hold them for you to pick up or mail them to you). Heather takes the time to write out what you should be using in the AM and the PM which is extremely helpful.  Also the Esthetician, Carmen, accepts medical insurance so it really can help you save money on the cost of a facial.   I cannot say enough good things about this place!!

I love Sephora! The people who work there are helpful, quick to greet you, & normally don't harass you. I've been to this location a few times over the last few years, I prefer to go to the actual store at the Chandler or Scottsdale mall but this one is close to home. My past experiences have been good, one time I was color matched & that was a good experience. However I went in a few weeks ago to look at the Sephora brand baked blushes. I was greeted by a blonde girl who quickly pointed then out to me. After I found one I liked I noticed all the Lorac products on sale (they will no longer be carried in Sephora stores), I have never tried the brand & figured since it was on sale I would try a few items. I would say in the span of 15-20 this one girl who works there asked me 4 times if I needed help. The first 3 times I politely declined. The last time I was irritated & just said no. I'm sorry I'm browsing through the Lorac area, my bad. The same girl rang me up, she didn't even bother to tell me my points or ask if I wanted to redeem them like she did with the lady before me or that they normally do at Sephora.  Long story short I would rather go to Chandler into an actual store than be harassed & receive lack luster service.

This location has gotten a lot better!! The employees the last few times I have been there are very attentive. Also I am impressed with the quality & quantity of products they carry on such a small space. The last lady who checked out my purchases went above & beyond & offered me samples of products.

So I waited to try this place out, because I wanted to experience it once the kinks were worked out. My boyfriend & I went there for the 1st time last night- we both opted for the build your own bowls. I order a regular size 1/2 chicken, 1/2 steak, with all the veggies, udon noodles, & a spicy peanut sauce. I also ordered a side of spring rolls.  I was very disappointed with the quality of the meat in my bowl. I asked for all white chicken & I received both dark & light. The steak, & I hate saying this, was something I should have fed to my dog. The veggies were cooked well, still had some crunch to them. However the onions on the bowl were raw. The sauce did not taste spicy or like peanuts. The noodles were very watery.   The spring rolls however were very good! Overall for $14.00, it was not worth it. The quality, & taste was just not good. I should have went to Zoe's or Chipotle, but next time I know that if I am looking for a better, casual dinning option for dinner, I will go else where.  It is a shame, because I really wanted to like this place & was excited to try it, because it had good Yelp reviews.

My boyfriend & I went here a few weeks ago. I ordered the goodness sandwich (turkey, avocado, & cheese) & he got ain't that a kick in the bread. I will only be reviewing my experience & sandwich, but I will say he enjoyed his. The board with the sandwiches was a little overwhelming & did not list everything on the sandwich which was a bummer.   The quality of ingredients was really good!  I liked the bread, the turkey was good, & the avocado was fresh. The sandwich was pilled high, I know this is odd to say, but it could have been less full.   For 2 sandwiches, a bag of chips, potato salad, & two drinks it was over $30. I thought that was a little ridiculous. I could have had a meal at a restaurant for two people for less. Also they hyped up the potato salad, it was not that great. Also it took about 15 minutes to get our order when we were the only ones in the place.  While the quality is great, I actually wish they would put less in the sandwich & bring the combo price to closer to $10. That would be more competitive with Jersey Mike's & I would be more likely to return whenever I want a sandwich.

I was a little nervous to eat at Texas Roadhouse, because of the poor reviews about their service, but my fianc√© & I decided to give it a go anyways. We got there at 7:40pm on a Saturday & there was a 25-35 minute wait. Which wasn't a surprised since it was Saturday. There was a ton of people waiting & it made it a little awkward to find a spot that was not in anyone's way.  We waited about 30 minutes before we were seated. Our sever, Andrea (Drea on her name tag) was fantastic!! She made sure that everything was refilled before we were empty, which for me is a huge deal. She was very friendly & checked on our table regularly. I give Drea alone 5 stars!! I was pleased with my rib eye expect for the fact I ordered medium rare & it came out medium. I think the quality of food for your money is great!!  The only thing that was a little off putting was the loud music & every once in awhile the servers had to dance. It kinda felt like we were having dinner at a bar, which I didn't care for.
