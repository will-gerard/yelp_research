Had heard great things about this place, and at first they worked really well with me.  After having my car for a month and a half, I was not getting any returned calls or information about my car. I had to come in person to finally get answers.  Originally I had been told it was my insurance that messed up, but when I asked to talk to the manager Trevor, he closed himself in his office and wouldn't talk to me. Very cowardly.  They DID NOT fix one of the main internal issues with my car, and when I asked about it- the production manager shrugged and told me to go through insurance.  I'm now going through the Better Business Bureau.   When I did get my car back the passenger window only works about 60% of the time.   I would have been more than happy to work with them, but unfortunately I was not being heard nor were my issues properly addressed. A little bit of customer service would have went a long way

Very satisfied with the customer service I've received from them after my first review.  Really happy they have reached out with new management
