I went in today to get my phone repaired. Unfortunately I didn't like any of the options so I didn't do anything but that's because the Sprint store can't do much as far as repair goes for iPhones. Otherwise, everyone was really helpful and pleasant and there was no wait at all. Andrew was the associate that helped me out and he was very nice and spoke on the phone with my father and explained all of my options to me. I would recommend coming into this store and making an appointment online if you need to talk to someone just in case it's busy.

I didn't have a good experience at Oreganos. I came in with my boyfriend expecting good food since there is usually a line when we drive by, and I was really disappointed. We sat in the patio area where there were at least 40 flies buzzing around outside landing on customers and on the food. I couldn't even put my hands on the table because it was so sticky and gross. The silverware was also dirty. Our server was okay, she was nice but didn't put any extra effort into anything, even when she said goodbye she was already walking away before she finished and it wasn't even that busy. The food was okay and overpriced. The spinach/artichoke dip was good but the pasta (rigatoni) was awful. It had no meat in the sauce and tasted like it was prepared from the freezer, which wouldn't surprise me if it really was. The garlic bread was comparable to frozen garlic bread you can get from any grocery store and bake in the oven for five minutes. I made a comment to my boyfriend saying how the food wasn't good but it was fine for being cheap- but that was before I got the bill. I payed over $40 for my meal and felt totally ripped off. I don't understand why people review this place well and why there are ever lines outside of it. Maybe people just don't know better. Won't be returning.

This is one of my favorite places to eat in Tempe. Whenever my boyfriend and I need to grab something to eat but can't figure out where to go, we always come here and are never disappointed. The food is always super fresh and tastes great and doesn't even take that long to come out. The service is also excellent, every time we visit we leave with smiles on our faces! The olives, caprese, sandwiches and pizza are great! As for everything else, I'm sure it's awesome too I just haven't gotten around to ordering anything else yet since I love my regular order so much. If you're ever in need of a yummy and super well priced meal, definitely stop by!
