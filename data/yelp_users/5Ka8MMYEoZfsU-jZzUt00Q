I'm surprised I haven't reviewed Pane! I've been coming here for years. I've only eaten lunch here once and had the caprese sandwich (divine). But dinner! Dinner here is where it's at!   Pane Bianco has the freshest ingredients for great prices. They serve the same six pizzas that you can find at their Pizzeria locations (without the hour+ wait times to get a table) for the same price ($12-16)! If you don't try the Rosa, with its perfect blend of red onion and pistachios, you are missing out. It's honestly the best pizza I've ever had in my ENTIRE LIFE(!!!) The margherita is also blissfully on point. They have seasonal dinner specials and I was really happy with a pear salad our server recommended. Did I mention their service? It's some of the best I've experienced. The servers know the food and are always quick to suggest something new.  They have a bar section, a few small tables and plenty of communal-style table seating. The lighting is perfect, and you can always pop in next door to their take out section, order a pizza or a loaf of their fresh-baked bread and walk over to Lux for a latte. There is plenty of outside seating that they share with Lux, but I'm not too sure if they will serve you outside (definitely not if you're planning on having a glass of wine).   Pane Bianco is a true gem of the downtown/uptown Phoenix area.

I really wanted to like this place, I really did. Unfortunately, our dinner just kept disappointing. Thank baby Jesus for Groupon, because if we had spent full price for our meals, I'd probably develop an eye twitch.   I went with their $18 vegetarian dinner special (poblano stuffed peppers with white beans, covered in a creamy tarragon sauce) over rice. My boyfriend ordered the Gallina Frita (shredded fried chicken breast with onion and Moros- rice and black beans).  The presentation of the food left something to be desired, but then again, so did the taste. We got pretty small plates (perhaps because I let it slip that we had a coupon?) The vegetarian poblano pepper entree ($18 mind you) had only one half of a stuffed pepper, over plain white rice, and was covered with a cheese sauce that was Velveeta-esque. There were no subtle nuances of flavors, just a bit of creamy slop with boiled tomato bits floating in the cheesy sea of regret. The corn bread that came with the meal was clearly microwaved and was 2"x 2"-- a sad display.   The chicken entree was dry and almost tasteless, except for the overly salted moros. My boyfriend didn't even finish the chicken nor did he want my corn bread. This is a first on so many levels.   This was Cuban cuisine?! Where's the seasoning? The spices? Where is the flavor?!   We left the Havana cafe and bid adieu to the plastic chairs and the tasteless plates of microwaved sadness.

Just tried this pita place for lunch as they had mailed my office some coupons and I was pleasantly surprised! They had way more toppings than I expected (bean mix, broccoli salad, tabbouleh, 3 different kinds of hummus and tons of fresh veggies). I also really liked their tuna option, as it's not mixed with mayonnaise, allowing you to create your own 'tuna salad' wrap by choosing from their hummus options or other sauces.   It's really convenient that they list the calories for the pitas and for $6, the 'regular' size was a perfect portion! I'm definitely coming back to try their falafel and veggie pita, too.

Tokyo Lobby is hands down my favorite sushi bar in Phoenix area. I've been there countless times and have never been let down.  I usually start with the miso soup and monkey brains for appetizers.  Always get their mackerel saba sashimi (amazing).  For rolls: Caterpillar Roll or any of their eel is amazing. Las Vegas Roll Spicy scallop roll Rainbow Roll (always fresh) Shrimp Tempura Roll and will alternate between tuna roll and yellowtail rolls.  Their service is fantastic, their food is amazing, and I never hesitate to bring my little brothers because they always have suggestions for kids.   Five stars!

Their pho is the best for an unbeatable price. Flavor is always spot-on, broth is so delicious. Spring rolls are really fresh. I placed a pickup order for 2 orders of pho with chicken and spring rolls. My only qualm was the way they tie off pick-up orders. Both the styrofoam cups of broth had torn at the top from being squashed into one bag and they had leaked quite a bit. I didn't sprint home or toss them around, just poor packing.

I have visited with Dr. Svoboda for over 2 years. He has treated my ferrets, cat and dog. He is extremely knowledgeable and will work through all possible options of testing and treatment that you are able to afford (they don't overcharge or take advantage of your crisis - like I have experienced with other vets!)  Palm Glen has always been able to book me on short notice, often on the same day or next day for emergencies. They also have great working hours that can accommodate a 9-5 working schedule. I have never had a vet that I have trusted as much, or referred as many people to as Dr. Svoboda!   The Palm Glen staff is compassionate and so caring toward the animals we treat as children! I have seen my fair share of vets over the years, and have yet to meet anyone as amazing as Dr. Svoboda (and his team).

This review is only for the photo processing. I had 4 rolls developed and scanned to a single  disk with no prints. 3 rolls were 36 exp color film and one roll was slide film. I paid a little over $100(!!) Had I been told that I'd be charged over $25 a roll (for no prints), I would've never dropped off film. Ridiculous.

I was always an avid Phoenix store fan, but recently find myself liking Tempe's location more. I love the open space and the organized racks. Employees are always friendly and willing to assist with starting fitting rooms or helping me to find something special. I found some great vintage pieces here on my last visit and was able to sell quite a bit of my own closet.   I did notice that they are starting to price jewelry much higher than they ever have before (saw some .925 rings for $60-140 in the case -- sometimes those prices are adequate, but this stuff just wasn't worth that price tag). I saw this same pricing in Phoenix, so this is probably a company-wide push.  My main request: please have a vintage rack, rather than mixing it all in. I really miss being able to see it all in one place.

I saw the review below and just thought it was ridiculous. RIDICULOUS.   Elderly people work here or volunteer. You expect customer service that you'd receive at a high-end store. No. People die and their things that are usually in good condition are donated and are resold at really cheap prices. No, the people there will not be making sure you're finding everything okay, you're on your own... and that's how it should be when you're thrifting.  I usually find great things. Glasswares, books, shoes, purses. They have amazing furniture that is so cheap. They have many half off days and various sales throughout the week.  Just make sure you go on a weekday or Saturday and before 2pm.. all the stores in this plaza close at 4 and are closed Sundays.

This place has the BEST pizza I've ever had. No, really. I'm not joking. I'll take one star off for the hour+ wait time.. but it was worth it.  You wait (just like everyone else) in the wine bar next door. They don't take reservations. You can't do take out. You wait. And you drink while you wait. By the time we finished our 2nd drinks, our table was ready... and we were really hungry.. and that made the food taste even better.   Make sure to order enough to take home... between my boyfriend and I, we ordered 3 pizzas: The Rosa (it has pistachios on it. and that may freak you out, but take a chance --- it's the best pizza I've ever had).  The Margherita (classic).  The Wise guy (for the meat eaters in your group -- not for me).   I love that the owner works the stove. It's a great experience.. maybe food shouldn't be instant.

We used to live a block away from Cibo. It was our go-to pizza place and for good reason; it's delicious! Their Margherita pizza is divine, and only $10! Writing this review makes me want to go back, like, NOW for the Funghi or the Vegetariana. Think about it, you're dropping the same amount of money on a quality, fresh pizza as you would at some crap joint.   This place can get real busy, so we usually do take out. I remember it being warm inside during the Summer months, but there's no way to escape that when you go to a small restaurant that has its doors open.

I've been to FEZ countless times in the past few years and must say, it's one of my favorite places in the downtown area. They use eclectic blends of pesto and cinnamon and fruits-in-places-you-don't-think-they'll-fit to liven up your ordinary burger or salad. Yom!   Their service is amazing. They have daily drink specials. My favorite is the $3 vodka pom-presses on Fridays and the $5 martini Mondays.   Whether you get one of their main dishes or a burger, you'll leave satisfied.  I've had the FEZ Burger, the Bleu cheese balsamicburger, the Tangier burger, tried all of their fries, had their mushroom risotto, the apricot salmon, the chicken lettuce wraps, seafood kibis, and have tried a handful of their martinis. I always leave with tons of leftovers and am never disappointed with their service or their food.  I love FEZ!

Phoenix Metro Retro is a mid century modern furniture store that also specializes in Scandinavian furniture pieces. Heidi and Douglas are the owners and they are the most genuine people!

Heidi Abrahamson also has her silver smithing studio out of the back of the store and her one-of-a-kind pieces are SPECTACULAR! Next time you're in, go up to the display cases and take a look for yourself. Heidi also sells vintage Scandinavian jewelry pieces.   You can get your couch, your lighting, your art and maybe even a jewelry piece or two here and you'll always leave happy!

I will always base my opinion of a sushi restaurant according to the freshness and taste of the saba mackerel sushi. Theirs is DIVINE. I mean, it was melting in my mouth. Sometimes you forget how REALLY fresh fish tastes because you live in the desert. Hana will remind you.  It's pricier than some other places, but their menu is extensive and their specials are always changing. Expect about $20-30+ a person, unless you order off the lunch/dinner menu only... but why go to a sushi bar without ordering said specialty.

We use Bertha's at work for lunch catering and they are always on time, affordable and delicious.  I always make sure to order myself an additional sandwich/salad combo when they deliver.  So to start, Bertha's is FANTASTIC.  Some of my favorite sandwiches: Roasted turkey Pesto chicken Roast beef and blue cheese Chicken curry  Their harvest salad and thai chicken salads are also fantastic.  I'm a fan!

We came here with a Groupon and made a reservation during a weekday. When we came in, there were only 3 or 4 tables seated, yet we were told time and time again how busy they were. We were seated in the back room, closest to the kitchen that was warm and stuffy.. smelling slightly like a nursing home. That was the first put off. The owner is very brisk and there were a few moments during our meal when we felt uncomfortable. We could hear him yelling in the back and when we asked for our glasses to be refilled we got some stern looks. Sorry?   Anyway. This place is OK. The food doesn't have great presentation. When I go out, I enjoy it tasting and looking like something I couldn't make at home. This was not the case.   We had the bruschetta as an appetizer, $8. That was fine, if not a bit plain and underwhelming.    I ended up getting the vegetarian dinner comprising of 4 sides: roasted beets, greek potatoes, orzo and sauteed spinach. The beets were not roasted, they were from a can. I know this because one of my slices had a can imprint... as in, it was the bottom piece. The best part of this was the greek potatoes. For $14, I would not return.  My boyfriend asked to do the dinner option where you choose a lunch sandwich. He was quickly told that that was NOT an option -- that instead the menu means you can have a dinner entree for lunch. That makes no sense and is not how it's shown on the menu, under the dinner section that says *or choose a lunch option for $2 more.. but.. uh... okay? He ended up having the chicken with roasted beets (canned) and israeli couscous. Also $14.   Overall, it was a very strange experience. He owner isn't too friendly and since we were here a month ago and were STILL hot, I couldn't imagine how it feels during the middle of the Summer. Thanks Groupon, I tried something new and it was a bust.

4 stars for : healthy, vegan, TONS of options, something for the noodle person and something for the salad person, lunch special options and a gluten-free menu. Mostly for the fact that it's vegan and doesn't do all crappy vegan processed food...   I've been here twice and both times ordered carry out - first time was so long ago that I can't recall what I had besides a thai iced tea.    Today I opted for their Fresh Mint Salad ($8), and I wanted it to be more traditional Vietnamese so I ordered vermicelli noodles on the side ($3-4). I was hoping the salad would be a bit more 'shredded' rather than diced, but it was good. The flavors are somewhat bland -- they don't use too many spices, herbs, (NO MSG) etc but I was really needing a good, clean, light taste. I also got their thai iced tea (made with coconut milk) - $4. Their thai iced teas are PHENOMENAL, but they are pricey comparatively (which is FINE BY ME! as long as I know it's vegan and not made with crappy condensed milk).  All in all - the food is healthy and light - but don't expect robust/rich/salty/greasy/oily tastes as you would expect in your local Chinese/Asian veggie stir fry. (Hey guys, that means it's better for you). Their noodle/stir fry may be different altogether, but that's not the vibe I got. It's a bit pricier than the average lunch if you order off the regular menu -- otherwise they have $8 lunch specials (but it's vegan and healthy-- to me that's worth it).   I'd like to come back and try one of the lunch specials or entrees. I liked it. I didn't LOVE it, but I'd come back. Psst, they also have a gluten free menu! YAY.   Cons: I wish they'd stop using styrofoam containers and plastic bags.

Chakra is a great option for people looking for genuinely healthy food. They local and organic produce and have many raw options. When you first get there, don't let the new-agey vibe turn you off. Relax and enjoy it, it's an experience.  I love that they work with you if you are gluten-intolerant and they even offer nut cheeses for the vegans!   I've tried the rawvacado dip, noritos, their daily special mushroom soup and a few of their wraps. Their specials can be a little pricey: ordered their gluten-free mushroom pizza and it was $18 -- so watch out for pricier monthly specials. You'll see that their items range from $8-16 -- which is very reasonable considering they use all local, organic and seasonal produce.   It's a guilt-free treat to eat at Chakra 4, and everyone that works here is very helpful and will be glad to work with you to make your dining experience worthwhile.

Thai House is a 2 minute drive from my work. I eat here probably 2 or 3 times a month and have never been disappointed. I'm a vegetarian, and they have a lunch special just for me! Mixed vegetables with tofu (I usually get it sans the tofu), with brown rice and a cup of egg drop soup for under $9. There's 4 or 5 other lunch specials, including the pad thai, which still comes with a side of rice with and a soup/salad. Seems like a carb overload, but if that's what you're into then go for it!   Add a thai iced tea with coconut milk and you're good to go (caffeinated as hell but so good). Be sure to come in before noon, or you'll be waiting for a table. Or do as I do and order pick up.

Ladies and gentlemen, I have found my new favorite Indian food restaurant. Groupon had a deal and we snatched it up as we've been in search of trying new places.   We arrived about an hour before they were closed and it was almost empty. They still asked if we made a reservation (we did) -- so it seems like that may be a requirement for later dining during the week. Their table settings are unusual and fit perfectly with the ambiance. The tin water glasses keep your water cold throughout your meal.  I searched the large menu for starters that weren't deep fried and were vegetarian-friendly, but we settled on the paneer fritters. They came with curried garbanzo beans that had the perfect amount of spice. This cheese is amazing, you guys.  For my entree, I decided to go with the vegetarian thali plate. It came with a large salad (the veggies on this were great, but the iceberg lettuce was not the best choice and it had a bit too much dressing), a curried vegetable (PERFECTION), a lentil and bean side (divine), yogurt side (perfect for cooling down the spice), large portion of colorful rice, 3 pieces of naan, a dessert (the BEST rice pudding with mango swirl) and a chai. The menu clearly states that you cannot share the thali, which I thought was hilarious because it's SO HUGE. No, seriously, I had leftovers for 2 more meals after this.  My boyfriend ordered a taro dish which they mentioned to us was 'dry' - no sauce. It tasted a lot like a potato and it wasn't my favorite -- I LOVE the sauces and spices the most - but he enjoyed it.   Our bill was $47 for an appetizer, a large vegetarian thali dinner plate ($14), the taro dish and 2 of their Indian beers ($5 each). I'm a fan! Only one star off because unless you order the large vegetarian plate, all the other options are a bit pricey. I can't imagine that this place does a lunch buffet but I may be wrong.

SideBar has a great atmosphere with unique and really comfortable furniture, great choice of alternative/indie music and ridiculously good specialty drinks. They have random movies playing without sound for looks and the bartenders are super nice. Love it!

The last few times we visited, we left really disappointed. The potatoes are super dry (and reheated), eggs overdone and overall taste is lackluster. Their sriracha is four shades darker than it was meant to be. Old sauce... or has a fake been refilling those roosters? Scramble, we're breaking up. It's not me, it's you.

Terrible management, disorganized kitchen, chairs falling apart, overpriced mediocre food.  Came in just before 4pm on Mother's Day. Party of 3 - sat in empty dining area. The chair at our table fell apart when we pulled it out to sit. This should've been our omen to leave this place and never come back.  Told their seaweed salad hadn't defrosted yet. Fine. They don't serve coffee. Ok. Placed order of salmon teriyaki, seafood teriyaki, an avocado roll and a 2pc nigiri- all as entrees to come out together.   While waiting some sort of metal panel on a tepenyaki table fell out of the vent and landed on the grill. This place is falling apart.   30 minutes later the roll and sushi comes out - I decide to wait for the rest of our meals to eat with my family. 15 minutes go by without our server checking in. We start to notice other tables that arrived 20+ minutes after us with larger parties receive their appetizers, then entrees. Flagged down our server. She acknowledged it had been 45 minutes since we placed order and said she'd check on it. Our drinks stay empty as we watch the servers huddle at the bar. I guess they don't cover other people's tables here?   Another 25 minutes go by. We are assured the supervisor would come to speak to us to take items off or discount for the inconvenience. At this point we just wanted to eat! Entrees came out mediocre - salmon was overcooked, but edible. Veggies were good- liked the ginger sauce for dipping. Anything was fine at this point, we just wanted to get on with our day. Sever offered to bring me miso soup since I had eaten my meal like 30 minutes prior.  We waited another 15 minutes after everyone finished for this elusive manager - Chris Corona. He came out and was instantly condescending and combative. Guy, it's Mother's Day can you chill or show a bit of respect for my mom and grandma? "Seems like you're upset about a small wait? You should've expected this wait, it's typical." Dining room was empty when we arrived-  tables that had arrived 20-30 minutes after us with parties of 5 were on dessert and closing their bills. When we tried to explain we had been there for over and hour and a half - he interrupted me and told me he didn't want to argue and would get us a gift card. We told him we didn't want to come back. Check came out without any discount. Flagged down our server again. She brought back check with 13% discount. Ok thanks. Put down card - were charged for the original amount - had to flag our server down again and she brought back the cash difference. Come on, get it together.    Our server Caitlin was nice and felt bad for the disaster but it was a nearly 2 hour train wreck from start to finish.

I used to frequent the Loving Hut back when it was called the 'Vegetarian House' on Indian School. It changed its name several years ago, but I still remember it as one of the only vegan options in Phoenix back in the day.   This was my first visit to the Union Hills location and I brought my mom and my two younger brothers. We were a bit confused about ordering -- as you have to come up to the counter to place your order. Once that was out of the way -- we were very pleased with our visit.  We ordered: Spring rolls appetizer  Fabulous pho chili burger blissful fried rice  The food is delicious and the menu is great as it shows pictures of every item. They even have a freezer full of faux meats to take home and try out. Everyone complains about the Chinese propaganda on the televisions in there, but I think it adds to the experience. Definitely worth a try if you are vegetarian, vegan, or are interested in introducing your family (even kids) to healthy meat-free food.

Kawaii just opened a few months ago. I've been there more than five times since.. it's just great! The atmosphere is quiet and they have unique tables that have double sided seats. So you are close to the people eating around you. Their food is fresh and affordable! They have a daily lunch special where you can get 3 rolls, a salad, and miso soup for $11!! And you have a list of 15 or so to choose from. If you purchase a beer or sake, you get a $.99 appetizer. The waiters are family and work every day and they are the nicest people I have met in a while. Five stars!

If you can make it here for the happy hour -- you win. You get their AMAZING guacamole for $5 and you can snag some tacos for less than $2.   I'm a veggie and I LOVE their vegetarian tacos, stuffed with seasonal vegetables: mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, avocado. So good. During happy hour those babies are like $1.50 each..  they're small, so order 2-3.  My meat-eating friends are always satisfied. Gallo Blanco can get pretty packed after 4pm, so be prepared. Their agua frescas are SO delicious... and I've tried their version of the Moscow Mule (the Russe) and was not too impressed. I come for the tacos, not the cocktails.

Last night was our first time at New India. I came in with four other friends. One of us is gluten-intolerant, and the rest are vegetarians. This is a WONDERLAND for anyone with vegetarian tendencies, though they also have a meat menu for the carnivores.  I had the palak paneer. The dinner ($12) comes with rice, curried vegetables, salad, raiti (yogurt), naan and a pickled side and a dessert. It's enough to have 2-3x leftovers.   The food is delicious. If you love Indian food, but only can afford the buffet during lunch at most places... you'll love it here. It's affordable, genuine, and ridiculously good. I'm coming back!

Hula's always get's mixed reactions from people I meet. They either hate it or love it.   I have converted.  My first experience at Hula's was not the best.. so I wrote the owner a letter. He comp'd my next meal and has recognized me since. Their service is great.  I've only come here for brunch -- so that's the reason for 4 stars.   $2 Mimosas? YES PLEASE.  My favorite FAVORITE item on the brunch menu: Ahi Tuna eggs benedict. AMAZING. I dream about it. Best!

I tried the Southwest seas fish tacos last week and they were brilliant! Perfectly blackened on the outside and soft & juicy on the inside. Paired with their rice & beans (and maybe even a cocktail), makes a perfect meal.  I brought my grandma and mom here a few weeks ago and they tried the fish specials: the pan-fried soy-misu hapu with mushrooms and the macadamia encrusted mahi with mango chutney (you can also do these specials with tofu!). $14-16 for rather brilliant fish specials is a steal! They were both overjoyed to try something new and don't think they'll be requesting Olive Garden (or the dreaded Cheesecake Factory) for their upcoming birthdays. ;)   Our server even recommended the perfect cocktail for my grandma and took it a little easy on the tequila, per her request. The service here is consistent and now that I started eating fish again, I can reintroduce myself to all that their menu has to offer. Forever a Hula's fan.

We stopped at Mellow Mushroom this afternoon for late lunch/early dinner. The experience was overall very frustrating. The food was 3 stars, but the service was a one star.   We waited about 10minutes to order, no big deal. Boyfriend created his own sandwich. I wanted pizza -- They let me know that they offer vegan options for pizza. Our server told me if I order the Mega Veggie pizza, they would just make it vegan for no extra cost (no butter on crust, no egg, sub daiya cheese for regular and add tofu). Awesome, right?  We waited for FORTY FIVE minutes for our food -- and we were one of six tables out of at least 30 available. They were slow, yet our server never came by to apologize for the wait or let us know it'd be coming out any minute.   We finally got our food. Boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich -- my pizza was pretty good. I loved that they use Daiya cheese and not some soy crap.   We get our check -- his sandwich was $13 (french bread, avocado, salami, pesto mayo, caramelized onions, spring mix) - a little on the pricy side. He enjoyed it, but definitely said it wasn't worth the price.  My 14" pizza was $19.50 + $3.99 for cheese. They added $4 for my 'vegan' cheese which I did not ask for (had I known, I would've just gotten veggies). I asked our server why this was... she gave me some attitude about how she's new and made a mistake. Didn't apologize -- didn't offer to take it off -- she even mentioned her manager knew she told me the wrong price. Her manager was aware and didn't come by. WHY NOT ASK ME IF I WANT TO PAY AN EXTRA $4 BEFORE PLACING THE ORDER WITH THE KITCHEN? No apologies, no discount and attitude on top of it. Super lame. That was not a $25 pizza.   Food was okay, definitely not coming back and not recommending this to anyone.

I can (and sometimes do) eat here two or more times a week. Their salsa bar is the best (pecan, mexicana, cilantro are my favorite -- I still haven't tried their strawberry salsa everyone raves about as it's not in season). Their veggie burrito is the most amazing I've ever had anywhere. No, seriously. It's true. Now they even offer a vegan version, but that Oaxacan cheese is too good to pass up. My meat eating friends love this place, too.   I'd give them 5 stars, but their service is a bit slow and you may need to fill up your own water glass or go up front to pay your bill.

I had to finally give La Condesa (recently changed their name to Santisma Tacos) the five stars they deserve. THIS PLACE IS MY JAM. We eat here all the time and believe me when I say that their santa condesa veggie taco is the best you'll ever have in your life (if you're vegetarian) and definitely awesome even if you're not a veggie. My go-to lunch/dinner is the 2 taco plate with one santa condesa and one ghandi vegan taco (their guacamole on this is divine). If you haven't ever had a horchata with fruit and nuts in it, it's about time. Theirs is delicious.   They also have brunch (!!!!) and it's so fabulous. Just make sure to add Oaxaca cheese if it's not already part of the option, trust me.

I came here once before to grab a bowl of warm ramen for a sick friend, and only had their thai milk tea boba (which is really great). I came back last night with a group of friends and had their vegetarian broth ramen with zucchini and a boiled egg. For a (HUGE) bowl of ramen and a boba tea, the total was only $12. I had plenty of leftovers for today. Their broth selection is expansive (even if they only have one vegetarian option) and their add-on's aren't pricey. I'm no ramen expert, and just recently was introduced to it. I've tried ramen at one other local restaurant and I have to say that Republic Ramen is pretty great for the price.

I was really craving a good veggie burger and Lush is close to work, so I decided to give it a try. We were surprised by the tacky interior when we first got to Lush Burger. Cow hide seats with red embellishments? Yikes...  The place was EMPTY on Friday at noon -- really strange for being in the North Scottsdale business neighborhood.  My boyfriend got the classic Lush burger. He said it was very mediocre. He probably wouldn't come again as he wasn't impressed.    I got the 'inside out veggie burger' - (it's important to emphasize that it was not exactly a veggie burger.. it was more like super thin pan-fried quinoa sheets (2 of them) -- in place of the bun to hold in all the balsamic arugula... very strange). The balsamic reduction completely overpowered the taste. It said it had zucchini and squash in the 'burger' but I saw no such thing -- only the crispy quinoa sheets.   There was a tiny slice of avocado and some red peppers in the midst of the arugula...  I wish they had an option to NOT get chips, and opt for a salad instead -- as I am obviously opting for their 'healthier' lunch option.   If you are looking for a new vegetarian option, this is not it. I expected a robust veggie burger patty with quinoa and vegetables ... not what I got at all.   As everyone has already  mentioned.. fries are $3 extra, so if you opt for fries, it'd be an $11 lunch meal -- it wasn't even worth it for $8. Disappointed.

We made two trips to Bliss/reBar. The first time.. we sat at a table for 20 minutes, I kid you not, and no one came by. Apparently the new hostess forgot to assign us a server. We left and I wrote them an email. The owner was nice enough to invite us back and offer complimentary drinks and appetizer. I figured, why not?  We get there and am pleased that our server is pleasant (probably the best experience about this place). We ordered a ruby grapefruit martini and an orange-cicle to start with. The drinks were strong but I'd never shell out $10 for something that small and plain.   Appetizer: chicken lettuce wraps. The lettuce wraps were covered in too much sauce and really looked like a PF Changs rip-off. Didn't taste too great. Too runny and too salty.  The boy ordered beef nachos and I had the 'loaded' macaroni and cheese. The nachos are deep fried, but the cheese is too milky and doesn't have any kick. The beef wasn't cooked in any spices, tasted like they just threw it on the pan. SO plain. The macaroni and cheese? Welp, I got it without bacon.. and it looked like it was out of an instant box with some store-bought powder bread crumbs on top. Way too milky and runny.. tasted bland. Mac and cheese needs to be rich, thick, cheesy. This didn't make the cut. I sent it back after a few bites and decided not to get anything else. Experience over.  We're never coming back. Although the service was better the second time around, the food is overpriced and bland. Thanks, but no thanks.

One of my favorite go-to spots for gifts, especially for myself. They have a curated selection of vintage women's and menswear, along with goods from local vendors and artists. They've got rust belt collective candles I keep coming back for. I always leave happy with new-to-me goods in tow.

I don't know why I haven't rated this place, as we come here almost weekly. I've only seen a few films here but we are regular patrons at the bar. They have great beer (peach ale you guys!) and wine choices that won't bust your budget and have world dance music night on Saturdays with Djentrification. I've never had a bad experience. This is our go-to on the weekends to meet up with friends.

Reathrey is a gem in the rough. It's my only exposure to Cambodian food but I can't imagine it would disappoint a real aficionado. I always start with a fresh spring roll, keep the basil seed drink in mind if you're feeling like something sweet. For main dishes- Their lemongrass chicken is great and my all time favorite. I also like to switch it up with the shrimp and chicken cabbage slaw salad. We've tried the noodle soups, ginger stir fry, fried rice, fish platter and cathew cha pan fried noodles. I've never left underwhelmed. Prices are spot on and portions are generous.

Rice paper is within walking distance of our house. They have happy hour and drink specials daily (which is great, as their cocktails are delicious and on the pricey side: $9-$13).  Their rolls, sandwiches, pho, and salads are great. Be prepared to spend at least $20 each if you are getting drinks but it is worth it.

Crescent is the BEST venue for a show in Phoenix. The seating, the space, the sound -- it all comes together perfectly. Crescent can even accommodate a small music fest with their outdoor stage set up.  You never have to wait too long for a drink at the bar and this venue is always clean.   My friends and I mostly come here on the weekends for cheap drinks/house wine and their bar food menu. If you haven't yet, go ahead and try the nachos or the bean and cheese burrito and tell me it's not the best bar food you've ever had.   They have different music nights (e.g. Funk Night) during the week. You can dance if you want to.

Nami is situated next to the Green New American Vegetarian Restaurant on 7th St, South of McDowell. The baristas are genuinely sweet and their tsoynamis (soy soft serve ice cream - made with coconut milk, soy milk and sugar) are out of this world! I get the mixed frozen berries smashed and mixed together.  Their vegan bakery is amazing: cupcakes, brownies, cookies, you name it. And don't forget to try their coffee! Nom!

I just discovered their AFFOGATO! It's divine! No, really. I have no words for how fantastic it is. I will never sleep again.

I was so excited for Green to finally open a location -- right across the street from my house. Everything I've tried, I loved. Their "burgers" are delish (try the Mexicali, Green burger, spicy 'g'), the rice/noodle bowls (drunken mushroom, mongolian, curry bowl, earlobe pasta) are awesome and their fresh-made limeade and lemonade and basilade are to die for.   I brought my mom and 13 year old brother here, and they were satisfied. You ever tried feeding a picky 13-year-old? He loved the spicy 'g' sandwich. Oh, and don't forget to try one of their pizzas. YAY.  And now, they sell daiya cheese for the veggie/vegans -- which is really convenient since many places don't have it. Five stars!

Green changed their menu, and got rid of their 'green veggie burger' which was one of the only items on the menu that did not have processed soy. It was made with rice and veggies and beet juice and now it's been replaced with fake meat. I'm just bummed since it was my favorite and you could order it on ezekial bun for a healthier option. Okay, I get it, this isn't a 'health' restaurant -- it's a vegan alternative for fast food and whatnot, but a girl can dream.  I have to say their fries are still my favorite and their noodle/rice bowls are delish. Uhhh and their fresh green tea/limeade/lemonades are so good. Mix them all up for the perfect beverage. Don't forget to go next door to Nami and get their vegan 'tsoynami' ice cream blizzard-style concoction and a latte (with coconut, almond, rice or soy milk).

This little gem just opened yesterday and I'm already in love! I followed their ebay store like a wild woman and am so glad I have a home base to fall back on. Their prices are fair, the owners (Ben and Cory) are ridiculously sweet and genuine and their men's selection rocks. I walked away with five 1970's tees, a blouse, a dress, and a skirt for $150.   They'll soon have a sell-and-trade policy, as well. They'll give Buffalo Exchange a run for their money. Check this out, it's a perfect location for Tempe college students and remember, when they can sell their dresses on ebay for $100-250, you'll be glad you can snag them for $20-35. Get it!

No matter how long I can stand not eating fish (95% vegetarian), I always break down  and run to the nearest sushi bar when I start to feel my omega 3 levels depleting. Trying this place was more of a budget choice when my 15-year old brother announced he wanted sushi for his birthday lunch. So we gathered my Russian family and ventured out to the Sushi Station.   I didn't set my expectations terribly high and I was pleasantly surprised. For these prices ($1.50-$5 and even less during happy hour), you can't really complain that most of the rolls contain the cheap crab filling. I tended to avoid the crab and the heavy mayo rolls.I tried every kind of sushi (two piece, fresh fish) pieces they had  on the conveyor: tuna, salmon, seared ahi, yellow tail. I also had of their Hawaiian rolls (tuna inside and out with a spicy mayo-based sauce) and the seaweed salad. You guys, IT WAS GOOD. No, it was not beach-front-ocean-access level good... nor was it $50-a-person level good. It was just simple (uhh and CHEAP). Making my younger brothers try octopus was also a treat.  You'll see things rollin' past you on the conveyor belt that seem odd (jello? fruit drinks?), but when you look around and see little kids ecstatically prancing about, praising the child heavens for letting them assemble (and color code) their own meals, you kind of start to get it. This is family friendly and the service was not lacking. Our server was really attentive and our drinks were never empty.   Everyone had stacks of plates. We didn't hold back. My family grabbed roll after roll, tried every kind of fresh sushi. There are also little cakes on the conveyor that didn't go unnoticed. After all was said and done, the bill was about $100 for 6. Six people who left stuffed. And no one got sick. Weeee!

This is my favorite new place in the downtown/uptown Phoenix area. Everything about the ambiance is rad. This place gets packed on most evenings, so you  may expect a wait time.  Their veggie board is ridiculously good. It would be a great meal on its own. If you're there with a party of two, I'd suggest ordering that and splitting a pizza. Their gemini pizza with potatoes and fennel is SO GOOD. I'm usually reserved about potatoes on a pizza, but this one hits the spot.   We've been here a few times and have tried the brussels sprout pizza (I'm vegetarian so no pancetta on half of it.. and I have to admit, I think it would have balanced the taste). Their funghi sandwich is really good and the ravioli was delicious.   They have these homemade wine coolers and tons of beer on tap. Okay, I'm a fan. NO, REALLY. I LOVE THIS PLACE.

Their menu has changed a bit since their opening, but their "At Last" pizza with subbed mushrooms instead of corn is the best thing I've ever had. Ever. I've tried their salads, almost every pizza, the burrata and it's all divine.

This place is delicious. They just recently opened (same kids who owned Sweets 'n Beats) and their menu is vegan-friendly. I had the fruity ol' goat- almond pancakes with goat cheese and strawberries and their fruit salad (best one I've had in a while) for my side. This was AMAZING. Beyond amazing. I crave it and want it all the time (!!!) The boyfriend got the 'What the waff?!' -  coconut curry waffles with hash browns. His portion was smaller than mine, and was not as colorful but he was satisfied. Their lunch menu looks tasty, too, so we are sure to come back.   They are only open until 2pm, so we can only come here on the weekends. I hope they expand their hours because the food was out of this world! The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is due to the hour-long wait for our food. We were there during the craft fair and their kitchen was backed up. Can't wait to come back!

My first time at Umami and I left satisfied (and almost bursting at the seams). They have a vegan broth option which was delicious and on point. The ramen bowls start at $8, I added a boiled egg for $1 and was a happy camper. One star off because I really wish they had more veggie toppings (mushrooms, extra seaweed, Chinese broccoli) or even some fish for the protein? Also, their menu is slightly different from online so they may want to integrate the two -- we didn't get an option for the spiciness of the broth -- but I'm sure you could inquire.   I'm definitely coming back.

This place is our new favorite spot. On Saturdays after perusing the Phoenix farmer's market in the parking lot next door, we come here for brunch. This place used to be a little market & cafe but they really did a great job reconstructing it. The patio area has sleek, long wooden benches and tables along with a fireplace and a bar area. And, it's dog-friendly!  I have dined here a few times and haven't been disappointed. I've tried the pesto frittata, beans & rice bowl, the open-faced veggie melt and the vegetarian Del Real sandwich (my favorite veggie sandwich everrrr). My boyfriend LOVES their Flanched Flarney Garney sandwich filled with bacon, eggs and avocado. Their bread is fantastic and you can take home a loaf, too.   They have a fantastic happy hour that we've been meaning to take advantage of. It's every day from 3-close and their five rotating draft selections look great. Oh, and their coffee is divine.  Great food, generous portions, lovely ambiance, perfect patio and a friendly staff. We're hooked.

I was SO happy with my ice cream experience here. Their waffle cones are amazing (and probably nothing like you've had before) and their array of ice cream (and sherbets) is wonderful. They have the classics but also have some interesting choices: salsa ice cream, cucumber, and nutella. You guys, it's so good. Just go here. Go here now.

I was here a few weekends ago for the second or third time, and I'm always unimpressed with the service and especially with the food, but the audacity of one bartender made me promise myself to never return.  The bartender was speaking pretty loudly to his friend about a girl sitting across the way with her friends. Publicly discussing her body (and I kid you not) saying "too much back fat" and "maybe the front is better." DIRECTLY. IN. FRONT. OF. ME. A woman, a customer, having to listen to this putrid sludge.   Great job, you've hired some gems.

Followed Dr. Wayne Svoboda from Palm Glen to this office. So glad we did because he continues to be the best veterinarian we've ever had for all of our animals. A few months ago our elderly dog had begun to have pain and spasms over a holiday weekend and they were able to get us in the same day we called - which was president's day. They have worked with my schedule for dropping off/picking up and go out of their way to follow up. We appreciate the staff and their resident talking bird.

This new location is quite a bit smaller than the previous store on Missouri. This means they have less room for merchandise and are a bit more selective when buying inventory. Regardless, I've made great $$ selling my vintage and gently used clothes and jewelry. For everyone complaining that they aren't taking your stuff - is your merchandise worn? Faded? Wrinkled? Damaged? Wrong season? From a cheap label that can't really be discounted much further (Target, Old Navy, Forever21)? Would you want to buy what you are trying to sell if it was on the racks? I know for some it's embarrassing if they don't take anything, so go walk around and enjoy yourself while they go through your stuff rather than watch them turn some of it down.   As for their pricing, it's really on point most of the time. If Goodwill/Savers prices their dresses at $10 and you can find something here for $12-25, depending on label and material, then you're getting a good deal.   Some of their jewelry in the case is overpriced ($60-110) for certain pieces. This is new, as I've been a loyal customer for over a decade and was able to snatch up .925 goods for $20-30. If this means they'll get more people bringing in unique items, then it's a good move, but the pieces I saw just aren't worth that price tag.   My only complaint: PLEASE bring back the vintage rack. This is all I look for when I come in and I really miss being able to go straight for it.

Tried Presidio for the first time this weekend. We arrived around 3:30 and were the only ones there on a Saturday. Ordered guacamole - was good but a small portion for $5. But what really stood out were the tacos. I had the fish, shrimp and chicken tacos while my partner had fish, chicken and carne asada tacos. Cooked to perfection with great sauces and toppings. Attentive service. We'll definitely be back.
