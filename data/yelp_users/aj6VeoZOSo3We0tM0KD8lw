Such a great place for breakfast!  Its a really cool feeling inside, very comfy and beautiful.  We had omelettes (spinach and goat cheese and mushroom and brie yum!) which came with hashbrowns (not potatoes, which was a little disappointing) and amazing bread with jelly on the side.  I also needed to try their homemade english muffin which was outstanding.  They also had a make your own bloody mary bar.  I'm not a fan of vodka at 10 am but it looked like it had a lot of great additions to your typical bloody mary! The reason I didn't want to give 5 stars is the the service was not so hot.  We had to wait and flag down our rotating waiters quite a few times and one of them was not very knowledgable about the menu.   Overall would definitely return for breakfast here the next time I'm in Vegas.  You NEED to try the jelly it is out of this world...couldn't stop eating it!

If you love Postinos, Federal and Windsor you with LOVE LOVE this place.  On our way to Postino's for lunch on Saturday we saw this huge crowd at a new place across the street and decided to try it.  Everything was delicious, especially the blood orange margarita and the service was great.  Definitely will be back!

Sad excuse for a diner. We went for a quick lunch and many things in our order were messed up including kettle chips being replaced for Lays chips from the bottom of the bag and missing bacon on a BBQ Bacon burger. The club sandwich did not have the classic three pieces of bread so not truly a club sandwich. Their "specialty" Parmesan crusted bread is white bread with Kraft Parmesan cheese spread on it. Very strange. The waiter never asked if we needed anything or wanted any refills. When we were paying, two of us wanted to get a to go coffee added to our bills. The waiter was completely confused by what he had to do with the checks and got annoyed with us. The place was run very poorly.  I highly do NOT recommend going to this place go to the Gas Light Inn around the corner instead.

Even though Cleo is in the new SLS hotel and a little of a pain to get to it is absolutely amazing.  The food is perfect and delicious.  The shrimp in garlic sauce, brussels sprouts, and the roast lamb were the stand outs of our meal.  Don't forget to ask for some bread to soak up all the delicious sauce!
