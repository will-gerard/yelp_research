For those of you Sin City vacationers looking for something more stimulating then just a smoky casino or an all-you-can-eat buffet line, Adventure Photo Tours is the bomb! They go to all the interesting places around the area, include Death Valley, Valley of Fire, Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, and of course, the long trek to all the rims of the Grand Canyon.  I did the Valley of Fire tour that picks you up in a comfy, air-conditioned SUV and makes the swing through the incredibly beautiful Valley of Fire State Park, with stops at an Indian truck stop; (lots of fireworks for sale) The Lost City; the CCC Cabins, and Atlatl and Mouse's Tank Rocks where an impressive series of protected Indian petroglyphs are fascinating to check out. I was amazed our group spotted a group of female endangered Bighorn Sheep gathered at the top of a rocky outcrop! Usually these animals are very shy and hard-to-spot!   The tour includes tips about how to get good photographs along the way and lots of information on the endangered species (both animal and plant) that inhabit the area. I liked hearing the history of the Indians who lived in the area and the Mormon pioneers who came through.  Pay cash and you get a little bit cheaper ticket price. I met nice people from England, Pennsylvania, and Poland on my tour and was astounded at all the French tourists who flock to the Valley of Fire! Busloads of them!  5 YELP STARS for a great company that intellectually stimulates you as it drives you around comfortably to gawk at the beauty that is Las Vegas-sans the neon, the topless and the tacky.

Yeah, it's $195 per person, but this will be as close as you can possibly get to the forbidden, high-security, ultra-protected home of actual aliens and their spaceships which have long been buried underground here outside of Las Vegas. This is the tour where you will hear tour guide Tim speak of the two friends of his who actually made it over the Area 51 fencing and began to roam the area on foot, only to be stopped dead in their tracks by two MEN IN BLACK who had been TELEPORTED out of nowhere to arrest & detain them for trespassing on gov't property.  Here on this tour, you will begin to make sense of the inter-relationships between this mysterious dry lake where sightings of UFO's have been observed and nearby Ancient Indian Petroglyphs at the Valley of Fire that resemble Aliens! Also visit Little A'le' Inn-where numerous documentaries and movies including "Independence Day" have been filmed."  After the tour stops to enjoy an Alien Burger at the Little A'le' Inn, next up is the location of the infamous "Black Mailbox," where numerous ET sightings have occurred and then to the absolute perimeter of Area 51 through a strange and deformed-(from ET radiation) Joshua Tree Forest.  This will blow your mind! There are guards (The Men In Black), detection devices, motion sensors, listening devices and cameras mounted among the cactus. The signs outside of Area 51 read, "The Use of Deadly force Authorized" and you can be sure they mean it.  It's fun to wave at the heavily armed guards in the 4x4 parked on the desert hillside but they don't wave back, they just watch from behind their darkened windows-ready to pounce on you should you penetrate their perimeter.  As much as the United States Air Force has denied the existence of Area 51, we know it is there but no one knows what it is they do there. This is how you can find out! Remember-NO PICTURE TAKING ALLOWED!  This is an Extreme tour to the world's most top secret military facility, the real home of the X files! Not to be missed! Any UFO fan worth their alien authenticity needs to make sure to get on this tour and check Area 51 out!  The Area 51 Tour is a  full day sightseeing tour that lasts approximately 8 hours and the van picks you up at your hotel around 7:00 a.m. It is scheduled to operate on Wednesday only , but as long as there are 4 or more combined people up for some extra terrestrial stalking, the tour can go out. Las Vegas is full of weird people and otherworldly adventures-but the REAL FUN is right outside Sin City-at Area 51-where Uncle Sam is hiding SECRETS so crazy, that they remain locked away underground, so as not to alarm the public!

Just like Anna B., I was surprised at how not-as-tacky Cupid's Wedding Chapel really is. It still is Las Vegas gauche but not terribly so. Unlike other chapels on the Strip, Cupid's schedules weddings an hour apart to provide time for maximum full production value.Cupid's pride themselves on offering "a traditional church wedding at a chapel price." In other words, the poor man's wedding-Las Vegas style. Included in the package is a bridal processional-(where I could not stop laughing at the absurdity of it all), dimmed lights as the minister introduces the happy couple, and then a tape of the couple's favorite song so they can have their first dance right there at the pulpit after their "first" kiss.   In a nod to mixed families, Cupid offers family weddings for those couples blending preexisting families-the children become a part of the service. Compared to other gaudy chapels, this one is pleasantly low-key and down-to-earth, with white as snow walls and pews. There are stained glass doves and roses, and a banquet hall where your party can feast and celebrate your happy tidings.  Internet packages include a live webcast of your wedding, and pictures of the ceremony. Best part of this place is: ELVIS WEDDINGS,  funky JAMES BROWN Nuptials, or my new favorite-a Johnny & June Cash-Walk the (Wedding) Line!  It has been a while since I got hitched here but whenever I visit Sin City, I always drive by and pay my respects to Cupid's. When you just gotta get married fast-for whatever reason-there are many choices in Las Vegas. Do like me and make it a memorable occasion with a little bit of class-let Elvis offer you the matrimonial vows; allow funky James Brown to beg you: "Please, Please, Please" or Johnny and June Cash will warn you in song about that "Ring of Fire." BTW-no plastic rose petals at this high class hitching post!

I was famished after a day of playing tourist and stumbled into the Ellis Island Casino, where in a little corner, you will find this Pizza place. I had heard from the shuttle driver that the pizzas are yummy and yes, that is so!  Thursdays are buy one slice or pizza and get one free. Same thing on Sundays too. I watched as dazed gamblers would rouse themselves from all their slot action and stumble over to Metro and grab a pizza slice and beer. There is a little area now with three booths that the under 21 crowd can chow down at. Otherwise, a sign does warn that around the corner is 21 and up only. That's because there are enormous vats of beer brewing right behind some windows. I guess Ellis Island brews it's own, which is brewing sustainably.   The pizza's are DELICIOUS! I had the Supreme slice and it was loaded with every good thing! In fact the piece of pie was so top heavy with ingredients that I could not lift it up to my mouth to eat, so I rolled it and thought to myself, I am going to get a heart attack from this, but I will die happy! I also ordered a 16 oz. cup of their brewed on the spot light beer and it only cost $1.75 for a cup. Also had the antipasto salad made on the premises and it was unholy good too! After pulling out the onions and peppers, it was full of slices of meat and cheeses with a wonderful Italian balsamic dressing.  Deducted 1 YELP STAR for surly service from the bored-looking cashiers.  But forget about feeding the sluts... I mean slots.. at this Casino. Just go for the pizza action!

Just about every weekend this Super 8 is sold-out! Why, you ask? Because it is inexpensive, convenient, has a free Airport shuttle, is near the Airport, and all the airline personnel and flight crews crash there between flights.  This Super 8 Koval is the LARGEST Super 8 in all the country. It seems to wrap around a very large city block very near the Strip, but far enough away from the garish neon lights and parade of drunken lechers that it feels somewhat serene there!  The pool is small and squished in next to the back parking lot but it is clean and the cool pool water was very refreshing on a hot Las Vegas day. Super 8 Koval even has a little outdoor cabanna area-complete with lush couches and chairs. I kind of felt that a lot of the hotel's male workers who trundle by with carpeting or construction equipment get an extra bonus from their job by the sight of so many bikined bodies getting fried in the withering dessert sun!  The rooms themselves are not bad either. Although there was an ever-present smell of stale paint fumes in the hallways, I was okay with everything except there the lack of conditioner or body moisturizer to go with the complimentary bottle of shampoo in the bathroom. EXCELLENT CELL PHONE RECEPTION! No dropped calls-probably because of the enormous cell phone tower that sits in the back of the huge Super 8 parking lot in the back!  Personnel are friendly and gracious; however some front desk employees are much more helpful then others. A gentlemen in the morning hooked me up with a great tour and whipped out his cell phone to call & make sure the driver was on his way. Later on, some grumpy female front desk employees just waved a brochure in my face when I asked about a city tour.   Best part about this Super- Ellis Island Casino right next door. $7.99 steak dinners and a Metro Pizza outlet that serves the best greasy but delicous pizza at all hours-day and night,  Right next door to Ellis is a 7/11 where I could go get coffee and cold drinks first thing in the morning.  It is possible to go to Vegas and enjoy yourself while watching your wallet. There is no need to deny yourself the pleasure of a little va-cay to Sin City if you're poor or not some high-rolling playa. It just takes knowing where to go and how to do it. Keep this Suoer 8 in mind next time your travels take you to the Neon Capitol of Gaudyville!

Isn't it BAD ENOUGH that we poor citizens of coastal California SUFFER the indignities of an onslaught of ZONIES from Arizona every summer? They drive slow like old ladies, are endlessly confused about traffic, and gobble up precious beach parking spaces that should otherwise go to tax-paying San Diego residents! I won't even get started on their white, gross bodies. What else does that desert hell have to offer us here? The manufacturer and management of RED LIGHT CAMERAS! Yes, that is right, ATS is the ARIZONA company that runs the City of San Diego's Red Light Camera show! Another SLAP IN THE FACE  to San Diego FROM Cactus-ville!  The City of San Diego Traffic website states: "To adequately enforce traffic signal laws, we use red light photo enforcement. Police officers cannot be everywhere at once." The City strategically mentions this also: "The (Red Light Photo System) RLPS system is a technology that records serious traffic violations the moment they occur. Cameras are used to photograph only vehicles that run red lights in targeted areas. Officers then review the film and a traffic citation is then issued to the vehicles' registered owner through the mail."   Now I have been to Traffic Court trying to get out a ticket (not Red Light) and I have seen the anger and rage that these Red Light tickets bring out in otherwise normal people. In fact, most of the cases that I witnessed in Traffic Court were offenses related to camera tickets. They are very controversial. Most of the thugs that live at my apartment complex simply take off (or cover up) their front license plates to remove the threat of a photo ticket. Why? The cost of the citation in San Diego varies, based on your driving record. Citations for running a red light are a minimum of $480. They are a hassle to fight and some require the services of a lawyer-another negative point against ATS!  I offer only 2 YELP STARS for this program because, although the intentions are honorable, (to prevent traffic accidents) there are still too many problems and questions still associated with this program. I am all for doing things to stop bad drivers from causing accidents but a lot of them manage to slip through the system.  ATS is just another Arizona scam to come out of the Great State of Hotter than Hell to bite San Diegans on their (toned & tanned) rears!

Well, this Gail also likes PhXpress because it is so darn convenient. It is located directly across from all the Southwest Airlines gates in the Phoenix airport. So as long as you can get yourself to these gates, it is very easy to walk over and load up on books, magazines, newspapers and snacks. I remember that I bought a delicious fruit water beverage last week that had no fake sugar and was naturally sweetened. It was so refreshing, especially in the sizzling summer heat of Arizona.    The employees seem to be on the ball and move the lines along quickly so you are not just standing there waiting. The magazines were current too. I offer 5 YELP STARS for outstanding location and the fact that this is NOT another Hudson News!
