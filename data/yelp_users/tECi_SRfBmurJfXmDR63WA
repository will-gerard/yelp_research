A M A Z I N G their roles are huge and great. I went with a friend who lives over that way. The owners were so nice and friendly. I cant believe I am just finding this place.   The underground menu is now public... I thought that was kind of cool tho, what I heard of it.   Only con, the waitress was a little slow, but she was nice and they were busy...so I will give her that :)

My dog Marley have seen the doctors for about 4 years as needed and for shots. Marley is crazy  he hates the vet office and is truly scared. Its really sad. Ever since he was young he didnt like our old vet. Every time I say he needs to be muzzled( he is a diff dog at the vet and its sad). Every time they try to show him love and w/o a muzzle. They seriously go out of their way to love on him and show them they aren't going to hurt him, which in my eyes means more than anything to me! They are all amazing and always seem to care. From the ladies at the desk  to the vet techs, they are all sweet! From start to finish I really love them! We just got a new dog and he seen the new(er) vet Dr. Estosito who I love more then Dr. Ketchmark. He is amazing and my little Ralphie loves him. He is content and let him do whatever he needed to as a new dog check up and shots! I brought Marley in for a shot and he saw Dr. Estosito and didnt even get that upset. He gave him his shot without much action and we went home. I love that the doctor calmed him with his calm personality. Great Office. Like one of the other girls said, when Marley was really sick Dr. Ketchmark gave me his personal cell # to reach him, if I had any questions and I had to call him. He answered and helped me  get thru it. I never heard of a vet give out his number. They truly care about their patients! :)   I learned my lesson by bringing my new pup to another vet to be neutered and will NEVER again go elsewhere again. Big mistake :(  *The only negative thing I have to say, its seems like I am always in the waiting room for 20-30 minutes. One time for 1 hour and I left. I understand things happen, emergencies and what not, but wish the appointments were a little more spaced apart. They do however never say no if you have an emergency appointment so I cant fault them too much. That is why they get a 5 out of 5

You know how you hear about shady operations? THIS is one of them. The "Relief Manager" is a shady character (Lisa?) and Katherine the flunky who works as ? god knows what is a joke as well. I am warning you, this place is so far from legal you need to beware. When I first came to this joke of a place they told me they took credit cards, then come to find out my first month rent came about and they didnt take credit cards.This is how it has been, from the beginning. LIES LIES AND SHADINESS! I have finally got out of there and now they are stalking me when I hand dropped off the appropriate paper work when I was moving and after a couple months they contacted me saying they never got the paper work. I HAND DELIVERED this paper work... I then sent in the appropriate name changes to have the unit in my exes name. They say they never got that months later... haha! They call me all the time when I have asked them not to, which is against the law, please learn the law morons, since you are the business and breaking them. Please BEWARE consumers. I have never dealt with such an illegal, backdoor, shady operation in my life. It is crazy this place can stay in business.I guess its all about turnover!   When I ask who the owner is to try and resolve this the right way, so I know it gets done, Lisa( so she says her name is), said I cant give out that info.... YOU CANT GIVE THE OWNERS NAME OUT? HA!!!!!!Really??? What a joke... BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE!   I will be contacting the BBB as well as the City Township to let them know all of the shady things involved in this place. I have proof of some. I will start with this, then I will move forward from there.

This store is super cute and I love it. The owners are awesome & are always so friendly, even in sad times for them recently. My dogs love it here, especially cause some of their products and toys are on the ground, so the dogs can see it! I buy all my pup cakes here and ALL their food and treats are good for dogs, instead of made in china crap. They also buy a lot of stuff from local small business owners, so instead of a cheap (or unknown where it's made or what its in it) the item you get is great quality that lasts, so it of course costs more. Recently one of the owners gave me a new treat they were starting to carry and my dogs loved it, which one of my dogs is overly picky. It is made from a local guy in Sedona. Yea kind of pricy, but healthy, natural  and I'm supporting  local businesses, which feels good!  I wish they were open later during the week, But hey they are always there and prob want a life too ;) Thanks for always being so nice and welcoming! Max and Ralphie love u guys and we will be back!!! Thanks for always being a fun place to visit!

Buyer beware! Trust me, you dont want to bring your car here. Myself along with other people I soon learned about, have had HORRIBLE experiences. They will lie right to your face. I had over $1000 worth of work done to my car and the problem was still there. After I brought it in for a 3rd time and they told me it would be another $800 I decided to just go back to the dealership. The dealership told me, it was not what they had repaired nor what they said would be the 3rd thing. It was the original problem I had told Fletchers about. It is really sad how poor their customer service was. Corporate is even worse and lied to my face about EVERYTHING! Please do NOT go there. I am telling you, you will regret it. I sure do, over $2000 more to replace a $1000 job. BUYER BEWARE!!! I wish I could rate this ZERO stars but I can't.

We went to Tortilla Factory on Tuesday, which you would think it would be dead right? WRONG? It was packed! We were told March (because of spring training) is one of their busiest months. This is my first time there! Our family arrived before my husband and I  (a little before our reservation at 645PM) and they waited about 5 or 10 mins and were sat. When we got there, they were already sat. Trying to get a parking spot is a joke and they do not have valet. We drove around for about 10 minutes until we found a spot, finally in a dark unlit area. That is my main complaint. Their parking lot is soooo tiny, for how large the restaurant is, I was surprised. We were greeted by a young smiling girl (who knew right where our other 4 ppl were at) and brought us to our table outside on the NON smoking patio. That is a huge plus for me. So many spots in AZ. are now allowing smoking on their patios during dinner! YUCK! I dont want to smell someones nasty cigarette OR cigar while eating. I think they might have another patio that is smoking, but not sure (The sign said MAIN patio is non smoking).  Now for service. Keely was a our waitress who was great. She was friendly and quick at her job. She was slammed and still made us have a good dinner. My father in law ordered the large sampler thing with nachos, quesidillas and ribs on it. It was decent. The ribs were kind of bland. I didnt try the quesidillas, because I heard they were really spicy. The nachos were underneath everything on the bottom, those were decent. I wasnt too impressed with any of it. I ordered the chips and salsa and it was awesome. I liked it, because it was not spicy and I could eat it, but had great flavor as well. The guys ordered beers and us ladies had non-alcoholic beverages so not sure how their Margs are, but as I could see many people ordered them, so they must be good. Their bar has a million diff. bottles of tequila lined up, so if you are in the mood for tequila, you can prob get anything you want.  We all ordered the same thing pretty much, two of us got red enchiladas pretty good. Nothing too special, but good. 3 got Build your own tacos, you get shrimp, chicken and steak.. A little weird because you have to pay extra for cheese and sour cream, you get guacamole, lettuce and pico. Dont ALL tacos come with cheese? lol Seemed weird. They all liked it tho. Lots of food that is for sure. The last person got a shrimp salad and she liked it. Almost all the way done with the meal my mother in law said they usually give flavored tortillas as a starter. She asked if they had any? Keely brought out Cilantro maybe? they were bland and had no flavor. I was full anyways, but I wanted to try it. For a company that has the word TORTILLA in their name you would think it would be amazing ya know? It was my father in laws bday so we got some deserts. I was so stuffed didnt even eat half my dinner. I did try some of the cheesecake we ordered it was regular with raspberry drizzle. AMAZING. They also got a piece of choc cake, they said it was great! It looked like it could serve a part y of 10. It was HUGE! All in all, I would give the food a 3 out of 5 stars. BUT Keely was such a great server I had to up it to 4. Keely did tell us that the weekends are crazy busy and there usually is a longer wait, so for people that had a long wait I would advise to go back in during the week. The patio also had a fountain and heaters. It was so nice out there, I could have just sat outside for hours.

Being a female and trying to find a company out there you can trust at times is hard. Luckily I found this company that has been around for over 50 years. The building itself is in Scottsdale on Earll, but they will send their Electricians anywhere. I set my boss up with them and he LOVED them (which is hard to do at times;) ) They were on time, gave me quote over the phone and kept the price quote the same, which is rare. They do NOT charge a travel charge like a few companies I talked to. Went to drop off a payment with the company at their local office and the lady there was sooooo nice. What a great company. Would use again!!! Thank you for being honest and taking care of your customers, new and old....

Let me keep this short and simple, I have a buisness account there and I get treated poorly. Just crappy customer service. Its seriously pathetic. They have TONS of people walking around the store, but nobody can help and if you are in a rush, dont stop by there. Its the worst customer service. I guess I seemed lost, the guy that was delivering ink helped me and was the nicest person in there I met... Sad... I am in there TOO much for that, guess we need to switch accounts. However, the online part of Staples is GREAT!

Ray has the BEST, HONEST PLACE AROUND. Seriously this guy bends over backwards. I have never been ripped off and they even ran the check engine light test for me, for free on numerous vehicles for work and private.  One of my cars failed emissions. I was so upset, the guy at the place said it was the rim around the gas tank. I brought it over to Ray, (he wasn't there so Derek helped out, who is his right hand guy & also great) he ran the test and said its just a new gas cap, thats it. He said if I have to order that it will cost you a few more bucks, just go up to the Auto Store. It cost me $10 and went back and passed. Thank god I didnt bring it to some place and they screwed me replacing the whole rim or gas tank. LOVE LOVE LOVE them. I will never go elsewhere.  I found Ray, because he was close to my work and I was bringing all my work cars there. After I found out how cool he is, we bring our family cars there now too. I have probably brought about 7 different cars there since 2009 and NEVER had a problem.  He also works on higher end cars. The whole crew there is awesome!   Thank you!   Cons-- (for company) He is behind the new, giant, discount tire so its hard for off the beat people to see him.

This is my 2nd time trying Oreganos and I will NOT be back.  The 1st time I went there I waited 45 minutes for my food at lunch, IF you have a set time for lunch do NOT go there. Thank god I did not... I was out of there in 1.5 hours. The question I had is how can they flip tables at lunch like that, which I guess it explains why it is always packed. The food portions are big and decent tasting, but nothing I would get excited over. Just because you get alot doesnt mean that makes up for the lack of taste and the 45 minute wait for the food. It took 15 minutes for the waitress to just get to our table and only because, the bartender finally came over, because he could tell we were irritated. The 2nd time I ordered carry-out, because the VP of the company wanted it, I decided I would order it as well. I went to pick up our food (salads) and yet again it was a cluster. I cant have spicy chix and asked for a chx breast plain for the caesar I got and she said sure no problem, I also ordered another salad with cajun chx breast, when I got there I said which one is cajun and which one is plain? The guy said we only make cajun (which is untrue, because last time I had a plain one with the salad) A girl came over and explained it really isnt cajun just has a little italian dressing on it, which is untrue since I decided to get it and its hot for me.. I cant have spicy food right now and I just wasted money on something I cant eat:( I would rate this place a 1 but because the food is ok, I will rate it a two. I will however never go back... Really sucks, cause its a trendy spot in Scottsdale and I live close to Old Town. Seems like a fun place, wish I just would have had better experiences like some of the other yelpers!  And the other posts are right the parking is HORRIBLE.. I actually got a spot this time and someone pulled in and parked right behind me and i couldnt get out. I beeped my horn like why is this guy parking in the street and behind all the cars, but nobody seemed to care. I finally pulled in and out 5 times and squeezed out, if I had my cadillac and not the work car, that would NOT have happened.

I would highly suggest to stay elsewhere. I always wanted to stay at the Luxor, because of the theme, I honestly thought it would be fun. Boy was I wrong. When checking in (about 15 mins to check in) it wasn't too bad, have waited longer in Vegas, I was offered an upgrade to the "Towers" I dont know what kind of upgrade it was, but none I have ever seen. It was dark, outdated and dingy looking inside. Hey we did get a view of the Excaliber hotel HA that was it, It was pathetic. We saw our friends who did not get offered an upgrade and their room was nicer, with a sitting area like we were promised oringinally.  Room Service was nasty and cost $60 for an omlette, shrimp and a lipton ice tea lol They charge you an extra $5.00 per person that orders food on top of the high prices, housekeeping never cleaned my room even after 2 calls to them EVEN AFTER the bathroom flooded, the place in general was horrible. The conceierge was rude, nobody seemed as if they cared we were even there. I would go elsewhere for $160 a night. The resort fees are high, but IF people did not see that on the website or check in, must have been blinded by the lights... They are as plain as day! This place has lost the sense of Customer Service and trust me, you dont wanna eat at any of their restaraunts either. Its horrible service and it took 20 mins, yes I timed it, before we got a water, we were so desperate for food, we should have just left tho. The waitress was so disgusting and rude, I was seriously embarrassed for her.....  Please take my advice and look elsewhere, obviously this place has a poor overall rating for a reason. Wish I looked on here, before I booked the hotel.

I went to book my room and the lady I had dealt with from the previous stay (Magaly Munoz-Mejorado ) had transferred positions and could not help me. The person she sent me to (Edna Martinez later I found out was out she was out of town and nobody could do her position except her HAHA! ) did not respond for over 1 week. I eventually just called to book the stay and I spoke with some ghetto woman who acted like I was bothering her at her home or something. It was crazy... I finally got it booked  when I spoke with a supervisor (Molly Merritt Hotel  Shift Manager) and she was so nice. She was one of the nicest people I have ever spoke with. She deserves to be in Edna's position. I really thought I was going to have a good time after speaking with her... but I was sadly mistaken.  The rest of the trip pretty much went the same as the 1st trip.  IF I read the reviews to Luxor I would have NEVER stayed there. Mind you this is my updated 2nd review. I went back to the Luxor and had similar problems. Check in, they messed up our room and I thankfully caught it, before going upstairs. After 15-25 mins w/ our Rep talking with her supervisor they got it squared away and we were on our way. The suite was actually nicer, much larger and more updated than the previous mini-suite. All seemed great UNTIL the night came. They had a banner that was loose and the large cables were  banging up against the window, which I can understand it happens. It is how you treat your customers when this DOES happen. I called to complain and the service was once again EXTREMELY RUDE. She finally said to me, Well do you want to move or what? Excuse me? I just want to have it fixed. She told me she would have someone fix it. I didnt get much sleep and it sucked waking up on vaca so sleepy. I called down the next day and they had no record of any of this. They told me they would call me back. Nobody did, I called back again a few hours later when I got back into the room and they told me it wouldn't be fixed until Monday or Tuesday and I was leaving Sunday afternoon. We decided to move rooms.This time we moved into a the same sort of suite, but just not as nice. The bellman told me he was surprised they didnt put me in a nicer room, because that is what they usually do. I was just glad I actually got some rest that night. I was exhausted from being out late and having fun.  The service at the restaurant this time was better and the time frame to get our food was MUCH faster.  I had a good time with my husband out and about doing our thing... BUT All in all I will NEVER go back to the Luxor.  I will try some nicer hotels on the strip. I heard a lot of good things about the Venetian, so I think I am going to try that one out next time we go to Vegas!

Likes- *Seems like they always have a spot outside (where others are packed to the max) *Can bring your dogs with you to hang out on the patio *Happy hour everyday 3PM-7PM with great drink and bar food options *Prices besides happy hour are not that bad either *Free chips and salsa-Very light salsa and fresh, which tastes amazing! *TVs to watch the games on (husband loves that one) *Waitress/Bartenders are always smiley and nice  Dislikes-   *Smells like stale beer and smoke very bad on the inside. Kind of a divey bar feel. *Allow you to smoke on the patio, which is disgusting YUCK! I always have someone that has their cigarette pointed away from them (to me) or holding behind them (to me). Hey its your cigarette you smell it right? It seems weird, because the patio is partially covered with the bar and Arizona law is 20 ft. from the building. I don't understand how they allow people to smoke at the bar or so close to it, when you 10 feet to the other side of the bar inside. *No parking assigned to Loco Patron! Do NOT park in the flag store parking or near, you will get towed. Heard horror stories on people trying to get your car back. Park on the road or try and find a spot in the garage. Its tough when its nice out and people are in old town or anything is going on. Prepare to look a while. BUT when its nice out, who cares, its good exercise and walk off those carbs ;) *You always get the drunkest and loudest people there haha! Its like people from all over kicked out go to Loco and they let them in! The music is blasting as well, which is fun most of the time.  Faves on menu-  App on happy hour-Cheese Crisp $3.00 Marinated Grilled Chicken Salad- $9.00  and of course Chips and Salsa = Free!   All in all its worth it to give it a shot. What do you have to lose? :)

LOVE LOVE LOVE Blue Wasabi!!! Located behind Houstons in the Hilton Village! (kinda missed back there) I dont like to eat Wasabi on my sushi so I dont know how the Blue Wasabi tastes haha, but I do know the food is amazing- cooked and raw. If you don't like sushi they have great small kabob apps that are soooo good (chicken and steak), they also have a pretty large selection of other stuff, which is sometimes rare at Sushi places. I will only go to a couple places to eat sushi and if its up to me it will be at Blue Wasabi. AWESOME SERVICE everytime I have been there and great food. I think this is one of the only places I have ate in Scottsdale where I can truly say I am 100% happy when I leave everytime! Management has always come up to my girlfriends and I to check on us and/or when I have been with my husband. I have never had a poor experience there, I think they are far and few between if so, because a lot of my friends love it there as well. Check it out you will LOVE it! Also there patio has misters so if its a little warm, sit outside and enjoy the weather!   THANKS BLUE WASABI!

Let me start by saying, I didn't have much to eat here only an app., but the service and wine was amazing.  From the Hostess, to the Manager to the Server, everyone was great! Everyone had a smile on their face and seemed to actually enjoy their job. It was a nice change from the norm in Scottsdale. The main person that stood out to me was the manager Art, he was so accommodating and went ABOVE and BEYOND to take care of me and my friend, even checked in on us from time to time.  We went at dinner time and even tho the patio was closed, they let us sit out there for some privacy. The patio was totally covered with small openings thru the slats. GREAT PATIO!  Art brought out some wine that rarely was opened by the glass and gave us the rest of the bottle to sample, it wasn't for me, but he was very accommodating and very helpful.  I selected some white (lighter) wine that he recommended, which was about $14 a glass, I think MoMo was the name. The server was really nice as well and when we got rained out from the patio, he brought our stuff into the bar area for us.  I will definitely be back to have dinner, because if the food, which from the other reviews looks like it, is anything like the service. I cant wait!  Thank you Roka Akor and Art for showing me what customer service is ALL about!!!  You have a customer in me for life!

I like some of the other women yelped below, loved Dr. Webb and thought he was amazing. He was booked up for a month and the girl on the phone ensured me that the nurse practitioner (cant even remember her name now, blonde short hair) is just as good as Dr. Webb. Now that is a joke, she is horrible and had no clue what she was doing! I am so mad I even tried her, it went so bad with her and the front office joke of a staff that I refused to go back! Now I have no doctor at a point where I wanted to start having children and I am starting from scratch. I would highly suggest you stay away.  Dr. Webb is awesome, but do I really want to worry about my appointments being messed up and the girls at the desk with their attitude when I come in, especially during sensitive times? I think not. It happens a lot, because as I was leaving I heard a woman complaining about her appt. being messed up. Then the lady in line by me said yea that happens a lot. (It took me 20 mins to "check out" so we were all chatting bored) The girl at the desk was so overwhelmed, I actually felt bad for her.  She kept saying sorry and said the other girl left for the day and left her alone (packed house mind you). Why would they let her leave if they are short staffed.  Also the nurse practitioner suggest I do all of these Unnecessary tests and I am left with a $600 lab bill for absolutely nothing, that my insurance deemed "unnecessary testing". I am completely blow away. They then have the nerve to try and send me a bill from their office. WHAT? Are you kidding me. Get a life. I am so sad by this whole situation. Normally I wouldnt "Yelp review" a doctors office, but as you can see I am really upset by the situation at hand :( Just a total sad situation.

This review was started a while ago maybe 6 months ago... I forget to send it.  I would have to say this place is just blah. My husband and I went to Tempe Marketplace and decided to get a quick bite here after we shopped for a couple hours. We have been here a few times and its always OK. We almost went to San Felipes (wish we did), but the music was so loud, I wanted to more or less chill out. We got seated right away, I dont think I have ever seen it busy there. Sat in a booth by the bar, across from the server station. The Coyotes game was on, so my husband was happy. We saw the little fliers they had which is happy hour every day from 3-7PM. It was 530 so that was perfect. We ordered 1 Corona and Iced Tea to drink. The waitress stand was literally across from our booth 2 feet, so we sat there watched her get an Iced Tea and sat there waiting for the bartender to talk with some people or friends at the bar forever desperately waiting for the Corona, which would take 1 second to get and pop the top off. She could of turned around walked one step and bring my iced tea, but she didnt. I said to my husband, wow what is the hold up, 5 mins later, she gave me my iced tea, I think she might of heard me..few more mins he slowly brought over the beer. I dont fault her, she was waiting there the whole time and didnt move, as to say hurry up. There was another waitress as well waiting for beers, while he chit chatted away.  We ordered the Pretzel Fondue for an app, which was different, because it was cream cheese fondue. I thought it would be a good, maybe a nice or different cream cheese, but I think they melted Philly Cream cheese you get at the grocery store ha! The pretzel was literally greasy, I dont know how that's possible and it showed its leftover grease when you would pick it up from the plate. Maybe it was the mass amount of butter put on it. Who knows. They sprinkled parsley on top of the "fondue" to spice it up I suppose, didnt make sense.  I ordered the Cadillac Salad with no meat and my husband ordered the Sliders with fries (fries was .99 cents more, for 10 fries) The salad was literally spring leafs, 10 shreds of cheese, 2 grape tomato's sliced in half (totaling 4) and 6 tiny, thin sliced, dried looking cucumbers dried on the outside rim of the salad bowl. (Looks like they put it up and waited for the sliders to get done so dried out salad) The sliders my husband said were ok. Fries were good. I had a couple. The bill comes and it was messed up. Seriously I am done with this place. I will not go back. I try and avoid the whole Tempe Marketplace period.

As I read some of these reviews I can relate. As Alex and Michael stated the food is SOOO bland and I wonder why I keep going back. It is always hot in there and the tables outside are always dirty. (Like others said as well) Sara B. Im warning you, dont go back to try them you will regret it  HAHA!  I really, really wanted to love this place. Its so close to my condo & not much else around there. I have been prob 4 or 5 times for food, trying new things and probably 20 because the sweet tea WAS amazing in the hot summer. Now they changed that and its not that great and its half the size as before. The other day we ordered carry-out grilled chx breast plain with bbq on the side with cole slaw, burger well with mac and cheese and two sweet teas. Things have changed, but its still bad, now worse. My husband grew up in Virgina Beach/NC and knows southern food. Unfortunately this place has never got it right, which I so desperately wanted to love it I gave it WAY more chances, than normally I would. The lady told me give me 15-20 minutes. About 15 minutes later my husband is walking out the door and my phone rings. I said "Wait" thats the BBQ place. I answer, she tells me, We've had some construction and I cant find the Chx Breasts. WHAT? Are you serious?LOL It took you 15 minutes to call me and say that and how do you "lose" food? Anywho I ended up ordering white shredded chx sandwich. She said 10 minutes. He sat around and then went up to pick it up. When he got their the guy told him, he was sorry for the call and they just had a huge order come in that cleaned them out of Chx. Breasts. WHAT are you serious? That is not what the lady told me, its like just be honest ppl! Then we get our food. I stg the Cole Slaw tastes like Miracle Whip and pepper or something. SOOO bland. The Mac and Cheese is so bland, I felt like I was eating Macaroni with a light cheese paste. It was bad. The sandwich was slimy and so gross I almost threw up. I put it back in the box and in the bag. My husband had 3 bites of the hamburger and felt sick. He NEVER complains about restaurants. He said to me, Why do we keep going here? Its always the same and terrible! I had no answer...  I called the restaurant back to let her know how horrible this food was and we both felt sick, and she goes "Well what do you want" I said WHAT I just wanted to let you know. She said "Do you want another order?" I said no way. I am sick to my stomach and so is my husband. She was soooo rude to me. I said Listen I thought you would want to know. She said "Bring the food back up and I will give you a refund." I was going to and had it all boxed up, but I just didnt have time to get back up there. Its not like thats what I want to do on my Sunday afternoon. I had WAY to much to do.I will NEVER be back and I will NEVER tell anyone to try it. I saw a GROUPON for there before, DON'T DO IT. Not worth it. Dont try it!  My neighbors in the condos said the same thing recently when chatting with them.   The guy ( I think he owns it) that is always there is super cool. There are a couple females that always seem like they are in a bad mood for some reason.  Trust me, its not cheap and its not good. Not worth it!

As always last night was amazing at Dolce. I love this salon. I have had everything from hair cut, color, build your own specialty makeup-DoCo, facials to massage, pedis and spray tanning and much more ha! Its so addicting going there and I have been going there for over a year. I just keep forgetting to write a review. They are amazing. KATIE who does my hair is a doll. She always chats with me and we have a great time as well as my hair always looks amazing. I have been in AZ for 5 years and for 3 of those years I had hit or miss appointments at salons and it was horrible. I have very long, thick hair past my chest, so its hard to get someone who knows what they are doing. I am so happy I found Katie at the Borgata. There are a few Dolce's around the valley all owned by the same lady Brandi who is the best and really cares about her clients! She is always doing great Facebook deals and have even done a couple Groupons for the Groupon lovers-no limits. They will never NOT tell you like some salons (we cant get you in for 3 weeks) They have plenty of staff and its amazing place to go. I rarely can give some 5 stars so trust me! This is the place to go for any spa need! They are a full service salon and spa! Trust me, I am brutally honest and can't think of anything bad. If something did happen for any negative reviews, they will fix it, if you wrote to their feedback. They want you walking out of there happy and relaxed!

I went somewhere recently, while on vacation for a touch up (for 10 weeks and highlights were growing out)  wow... I really learned how lucky I am. They put color instead of bleach, my hair turned brassy and looked terrible... I then Got my hair highlighted by Katie C. as always at Dolce when I got back... to fix it, but this time, went VERY blonde. She did such an amazing job. I love her and the quality of work she does. I always feel like a million bucks when I leave. If I ever move I will have to fly back just for my hair haha.

I have been to the W Scottsdale, but never stayed here, since I live in Scottsdale. My gf came in and got a suite, so I stayed with her. The W is a great place and they will accommodate you for whatever you want. I heard someone complaining about hangers. Yes they had like 5 there and we laughed... but we called down and asked for TWENTY (20) and they brought them right up haha it was great. We needed an extension cord, they brought it up. They were not up to the iphone 5 yet, so my girlfriend was frustrated they were iphone4 only friendly.  They did have Bose surround system and iphone4 pod stations in a few areas of the hotel. The suite we had did not come with a bath, which was disappointing, you had to upgrade to a bath suite..weird I thought. The suite was on the same floor as the pool and gym, which was nice. We could walk out our door and go to the pool, which was covered with a fake ice rink. We had access to the Phoenician to swim, if we wanted...BUT who wants to go over to another pool. I would not have used the pool, because it was too cold, however she did want to use it. (This was about a month ago we stayed) The staff was ever so friendly and always there to help. I would stay there again. They come in, in the evening and turn down your lights, pull your throw pillows off the bed. They adjust your room for bedtime. It is very comforting and try and make it more like home. I love that. I would highly recommend the W and would stay there anytime.   Oh and the water is bad everywhere...unfortunately that is AZ. for you. haha  The W in Hollywood is great as well, stayed there over the summer. Will write a review later, since VERY behind on reviews.  Thank you W for making it a great stay!

We went to BLT Steak with some friends for a NYE 10' dinner. We were seated pretty quick to a nice circular booth in the back. Our waitress was on point and did a GREAT job!  We started with some wine, (I cant remember the name I ordered) but it was a great flavor. Then we received the complimentary Popovers that were just AMAZING! The butter and sea salt, just tops this off to one of the best things I have tasted. Our friends had been there numerous times before and were telling us how much we would love it and we DID! They were a fluffy, chewy perfection! Yumm!  We ordered the shrimp cocktail for an app, which was great as well! The shrimp was fresh and the sauce was delicious a bit spicy, but worth it! The only thing that disappointed me was there were only 4 (and smaller sized at that) shrimp  for $17... Usually they are larger at that price...BUT it was so great I would still order it again.   Our friends ordered the Tuna Tartar and loved it as always. For dinner I had the Lemon Rosemary Chicken and it was huge, I couldn't finish half of it even, I would say it was good, not the best I have ever had.. a Baked potato and the Braised Carrots. I didn't not know how HUGE everything was. The potato was kind of dry and not worth $9 the Carrots were $9 a piece and delicious, well worth it.  My husband ordered the 12 ounce Filet for $47 and thought it tasted great. He also order a baked potato and carrots. He thought the same about the potato and the carrots as I. I wish we ordered a couple diff things and tried each others, but we didn't realize how much was coming our way. Our friends ordered the Filets and theirs were amazing as well. We ended with a coffee and Crêpe Soufflé w/ Passion Fruit Sauce. I was so full I only had one bite of the dessert, but it kinda tasted soggy and not the best... BUT I am not sure if that's how they make it or not.  For our dinner it was about $225 with a couple glasses of wine.  In all this place was worth it, we had a great dinner and great company.... After we were done with dinner we went outside by the fire, while waiting for Valet. This place was a lot of fun. I think it would be nice to go back during the day, because it is on Camelback and the views were amazing. (as I could see in the dark) I saw they have a pretty decent Happy Hour and will def. be back!  I would recommend it to others, I think people would really enjoy themselves.

Great service, the ladies are so sweet that work the registers and really love animals. They are genuine people and I love that they are so sweet when we come in there. My dog loves it there. They even have a scale in the back if you want to check out your dogs weight :)They also have tons of cats and dogs for adoption. They have a huge room in the back that has tons of dogs up for adoption, from the shelter they bring in. Its actually kind of sad tho, because there are so many that need homes. The only thing I didnt like is, I went back there and they had a litter of puppies that were exposed to parvo and they were "isolated" (they had their own cage?) and they didnt have any signs posted saying that. Made me nervous, because the guy told me to wash my hands when I was leaving if I had a dog.. eeek...but besides that, the store I highly suggest you go there. They are trying to save lives, just need to get better organized back there!

OMG I love this place! My GF and I went a couple weeks ago. Only bummer was we missed happy hour. Looked like great happy hour tho. I ordered two glasses of Champagne and she had a couple glasses of some red wine and loved it. We had to of course have Bruschetta and it was amazing. I also got the olives to try it out. Great. I have nothing bad to say about this place. Our waiter was AWESOME and his girlfriend happened to work there as well. They were both sweet and great at their job. It makes it nicer to have nice people waiting on you, which in Scottsdale has been rare lately.

Went back again and had another great time. Steve is the manager that waited on us last time I found out and this time he stopped by the table to say hi. This place has great food, service and happy hour prices. HIGHLY suggest you go there. :)  We again ordered the Brushetta which is AMAZING, sweet/garlic fries YUMM. My friend had red wine and I had some champagne. We also had the wrapped breadsticks, but I wasnt a fan...Thats ok tho.  They are so cool there and down to earth. It was so fun and I will be back again!  Thank you again for a fun time!

My husband and I took my mom here for dinner on Thursday night. We started off with the suggested Pretzel/Fondue app. My mom wanted to try the bread and oil as well. HOLY CARBS. It was amazing tho. I was pretty full before dinner even came.  Not a huge menu, so My mom ordered the shrimp salad-grilled, not fried like it comes, I ordered the Chicken Salad and my husband ordered the Italian Salad ( I think it was called that)  The pretzel app was amazing. The fondue tasted so amazing I could eat it every day haha. The oil for the bread had a sweet balsamic at the bottom and it was amazing, one of the best Ive had.  The salads were awesome. My husband said the best salad hes had in a long time. My mom and I liked ours as well. Husband also got a purple haze, which is a beer he said he has only seen in Denver, so he was happy about that.  We sat on the patio (even tvs with the game on it) and the heaters were on, man we live in AZ. for sure. We had a great time. I would def. suggest it. The only thing I didnt love was the music was super loud at times, then would get quieter, then super loud, so it was hard to talk, even outside, but I will still be back. Great Place.

So I will NEVER write a bad review unless I have been to a place at least 2 times with BAD service. This is the 3rd time I have been at Echo.. All I can say is UGH! This place has miserable people working there. Could you please put on a smile on your face and at least fake it? I mean come on, I am paying $3 and change for a coffee, at least smile and say thank you or something, ANYTHING. I have seen similar reviews, where people say they are rude and I hear their pain. I guess maybe if I was sitting there ALL DAY drinking a glass of water they would have been nice to me, like some of the others, but since I bought a coffee and a bottle of water they are rude? Not sure why, but when I walked out I said Thank you and the people behind the counter said nothing, not a word.  I am so sick of trying to support local business owners that hire cheap horrible labor, and this is how I am treated. I am gonna stick to Starbucks, I go in there everyday and they always have a smile on their face, faking it or not... I kinda stumbled around putting the cream in my iced to go coffee, (since they put it in a small silver creamer container, instead of in the coffee) so I could see if maybe it was me, but they were the same way to the woman behind me who ordered in. She looked at me and I looked at her, just kinda confused like what is going on? I bet she will not be back either, unless she gets better service from them while she dines in. Echo.... I will go down the road and support my local Starbucks chain. Sorry.... I tried to give you a shot, but this local business will not support yours anymore....

If I could rate this place a big fat ZERO I would. This place has the WORST customer service I have EVER dealt with in my life. I purchased (2) Groupons from this place, bad idea and WISH I never did. I tried calling them NUMEROUS times and never got an answer always a VM and NO option to hold. I figured since two days in a row they did two diff hook ups, maybe they were overwhelmed (Living Social and Groupon BOTH). I left a message, which never got a call back. I then continued to call over and over again. Days later I finally got the owner who said she was so busy and over whelmed with calls, she just didn't have time to call me back? Ok.. SO I tried to book an appointment.... They didn't have anything open for weeks. I am assuming they took on WAY more than they could handle (seeming so from other reviews) I tried calling back numerous times and again they never answered and when I leave a voicemail I would never receive a return call. My Groupon was ending soon so I decided to once again try and book and appointment. So I start calling about a month ago. No answer no call back... WTF is going on here... I finally get a hold of someone (dialing there number 10 times in an hour) who says (I think she said she was the owner) we aren't taking anymore appointments until after the 18th, after the Groupon ends HAHA! I was stunned I said, that isnt fair and explained Ive left messages you never answer your phone how am I suppose to get in? She said well "We left a voicemail on our phone stating we had the flu (really the flu)and are short handed!" Ok #1 I NEVER heard that once in all of my calls #2 HOW is that my problem? I explained that my Groupon was ending and she said "Like hundreds of other people in your situation" WHAT really? She just said this as the owner. I asked well if thats the case then you should extend the offer. She said IF I extend the offer I will never make any money at this. I told her Maybe instead of doing two different promos she should have only done one. I said I usually go to Dolce and wanted to try something new, She replied well you wont be a repeat customer so I dont care anyways... (Like she knew she couldn't live up to Dolce's customer service and pedi HAHA) Then she said just call Groupon and get your money back, they have a no ask policy and will refund you, I cant help you. They are the one who OVER SOLD the Groupon and its there fault anyways. Im thinking YOU did Living Social and Groupon in TWO days and only allowed 6 months to get all your thousands of customers done.   I hope that Groupon never allows that company to again post a special from all of the negative reviews and many peoples experience with this weird place. After reading the many reviews about the tin can, ripped couches GROSS, long nails and horrible scrubs, I AM SOOOO GLAD that I called Groupon and got my money back. I would advise EVERYONE to do the same. Groupon did say they had quite a few calls about this place, and they were sorry that their customers had to deal with the service they have been giving. THANK GOD I purchased this from Groupon and received a full refund on both purchased!!! Sorry so winded, but this company was just a complete ZERO!

Like some of the others, I am rating the FACILITY not the comedian. The comedy show was awesome and we laughed so hard.  I purchased tickets to see David Spade for my husbands birthday. He is a huge David Spade fan and I thought it would be fun to go see a show. Tickets were approx. $100 for 2, which isn't too bad. I realized it is first come first serve (not assigned seats) that however was not good. I was really disappointed when we arrived. We got there about 30ish mins before the show. There was NO parking so we had to park quite a ways away and walk down. It was PACKED inside the venue. We sat on the far right of the stage when you first walk in against the wall (which has reserved seating and the waitress removed it, which I found odd? later I realized why, the security were letting some girls come in and out at their leisure to watch the show). I sat facing the stage, my husband faced me. It was weird. He sat on a tall bar stool. We wanted to order food and drinks, but the server who sat us was not our server, he said he would tell our server what we wanted to drink tho. About 15 mins later our server showed up. I said we already ordered drinks, but he had no clue on what we were talking about. (So it took him 15 mins to greet us pretty much) We ordered some drinks and took another 15 min. to get it.  I forgot to mention that they seat you with other people. If your group is smaller than 4ppl. It was weird. You sit at a 4 top next to another couple. Very strange. The people next to us were like wtf is going on. It is literally like a table face to face and very close. The other couple was very nice, just seemed odd. We tried to get the attention of our waiter, because we wanted dinner, but he just didnt have the time. I saw him taking orders from other people across the whole floor. WTF? I have been a waitress before and have never had a manager put your section that far apart. I watched him in pure distress trying to get everyones order. I wasnt tough on the guy, because I knew he was trying his best with the situation he was given. Finally we grabbed him. It was about 30 mins later so it was pointless to order dinner (which we had waited to eat til we got there) I wish I ordered from the beginning. We ordered the Filet bites, just to ease our hunger. The bites were actually really good and I enjoyed them. We watched the show and laughed and had a great time given the situation. Kevin Farley was there as a "surprise" guest and my husband was in heaven. Then it comes time for last call, we order last call, he comes to our table, gives the couple next to us their order and doesnt give us ours. Gives the couple to our left their order not ours. He totally forgot our order I guess, I actually was glad, because literally the lights came on and that was the end of the show. WHAT you do last call and it takes SO long to get your drinks, the show is over haha!! I forgot to say as well.... The couple next to us actually went to the bar outside the actual theater, because the waiter kept bringing them white wine when they asked for Cabernet. The funny thing is, they pointed at their wine and said Cabernet, red wine (the wine they got from the bar the last time) and he came back with white, they thought a Chard. I said I even heard that! They laughed and said oh well...They were nicer than I, because they drank it. She told me, just to hard to flag him down and she wanted to have the glass, before it would take him the time to get back to her and another drink. When reading the other reviews I think they always under staff and slam everyone in like sardines. Not cool.

I went back again of course for Happy Hip treats for my dog and ended up speaking with Jay. He was great. I am so happy I went back, it was like the 1st time I went. Super relaxed and not power selling.  I am going to keep going back, hope I just dont run into that young girl, that follows me around like a hound.

A friend recommended me to try this salon out. Wow! Thats one word that describes this salon. I only have had a pedicure done, because I dont get my nails professionally done. The pedicure there is ONE OF A KIND (and I have had a million done) I always get the Cucumber Pedicure, this is the step above the regular one, and this is what it consists of, choice of color (French is extra, like all salons) they have a TON of diff colors if you are into that (I prefer a French Manicure). You sit down and get a warm wrap around your neck, which feels amazing. You then get the normal filing of the toenails,feet, and cuticle treatments. You have the option for Sea Salt Scrub or Paraffin Wax . I have gotten the Paraffin Wax 2X and it is the most amazing thing I have ever felt. Anyone that has gotten their fingernails done for a long time has had the paraffin dip for their hands, but FEET? I have never heard of it, now I am addicted. It is so awesome and makes your feet so silky smooth. What could top that off? I will tell you! You get the most amazing hot stone massage, topped off with a regular leg & foot massage. Then she puts a hot towel on your legs to top it off. You get your polish put on and you are about done, time to dry your feet. By the way...The French is super straight not crooked and the best I have had. Its hard to top this place! You go over to the drying station and you think thats it, no not quite..You get a neck and shoulder massage. This is by far the best pedicure I have ever had. I live in Scottsdale about 20ish mins away (depending on traffic). There are so many salons by me and I live, work and do everything here. So trust me. Its worth it. My spa/salon I go to that I love! Doesn't even compare, which is a shocker for me. The upgraded Cucumber Pedi is $30 and the French is $5.00. So worth it. I would bet anything you will LOVE this place! Also all the women that do your nails are super friendly and its a fun place. The lady Melissa that checked me in is funny and a great addition to the salon. I will be back time and time again! :)  Side Note- Make sure you bring cash, because you have to tip in cash. You dont want to stiff the girls who do your nails!

I went back again for the paraffin pedicure, because I LOVED it. I was waiting for it to be bad this time, because it seems like every nail salon you go once and the next time, it sucks! Centre Point however, did NOT disappoint. I was so happy. My feet feel like silk when leaving. This is the best place. I also love they give you this little menu, instead of saying you want sea salt and you say OK and get charged $10. This place points it all out for you. Its so nice. I chose the paraffin pedi, which is a little more, but I PROMISE you, it is by far the BEST and worth it!!! You get an amazing leg/foot massage and they take their time. They use hot stones as well. Its so amazing, I feel like I am walking on air when I leave. Just yelping makes me want to go back LOL!  The ladies are so nice. The offer you beverages if you want, they really make you feel at home. I dont use the massage part of the chairs, but they are over sized and very comfy as well :)   The only problem is it is 20 mins from house and for a quick last minute pedi, I settle for a sub par place by my house.  Thank you again for consistency and great service.

I ordered a catering order on Friday for Monday pick up. It was messed up, I called and spoke with a manager, who was going to look into it.   Veronica the catering manager called me back. (Someone else took the original order-a man not her) The reason I will give Paradise Bakery 5 stars on this day still, is HER CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AMAZING. She ended up coming to our office bringing us cookies and 10% off catering order and free sandwich coupons. She went ABOVE AND BEYOND. I couldn't believe she actually drove to my office to sincerely apologize on the order. I actually was just at paradise bakery ordering for myself 20  mins before this. I double check my order from now on, because of errors and she said ask for her from now on and I can just order thru her. I told her that isnt necessary since she has all the catering orders, but I appreciate her sincere offer. She makes me want to continue to be a loyal customer. Again I love Paradise Bakery. I just hated the mess ups. I will continue to eat there and order our catering thru them.  Thank you Veronica. You should be praised for your great customer service.

Wow this place is awesome! Let me tell you from start to finish. I thought I would be high pressured to buy a membership or other stuff, but I wasnt. From start to finish it was so nice and actually enjoyed seeing all they had to offer!  Mike the manager helped my husband and I when we first arrived. He is so nice and laid back. He gave us a tour of the gym and showed us around the diff classes they offer for free and what they charged for. He was up front about everything. They have free yoga classes and spin classes. You have to pay for a couple of the more extreme classes and 1 on 1 stuff, but thats normal. They have a tanning bed you can pay for if you want, but thats normal. They have a sauna and huge locker room. They have a little theater room if you want to watch the movie that is playing. They have a smoothie station, where you can get drinks and what not.  Everything there is new and super clean. All of the cardio equipment have a small tv on them so you can watch the news or whatever is on. Its a nice touch if you are into that. They have music playing in the gym to keep you pumped up, if you dont bring an Ipod. Its a really nice place. We have a membership at our Condos, but decided to purchase a membership at the gym, since they have much more than our small gym. I love working out there and am happy I decided to join! Thanks Mountainside!  Oh they also have a daycare if you want to bring the kiddos with you while you work out. I know that is important to a lot of working moms and dads :) They have diff charges for that, so I am not quite the charge. They do have package deals tho.

Wow I have never met a doctor like Dr. Kim. She is so sweet and compassionate. I had a small scar on my back and went to see Dr. Kim. She asked if she could do a skin exam and I said yes. She did a quick body skin exam and everything was great thank god. She is helping reduce the scar size on my back and is so gentle with any shot or anything she gives. I have a huge needle phobia and her nurse even held my hand LOL can you believe that? I know I sound 10, but it worked! I give them an A+. I would recommend her to anyone. They really know what they are doing!
