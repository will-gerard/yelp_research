This Is The Best Bar.  I've Been Coming Here For Two Years Now.  Service Is Excellent n The Food Is Amazing.  Derrick Is By Far My Favorite Server.  The Fact That This Bar Is My Favorite Football Team Spot Makes It Even Better.  My Friends That Aren't Seahawks Fan Even Love It.  If You Want A Great Night Out With Friends Come Here To Skeptical Chemist You Won't Leave Unsatisfied.  I Promise.

I came here to have breakfast this morning.  Sat down at 9:10 walked out at 9:35 with Not one eye contact Not a hi, No here's some water, No service at all.  I sat and watched a family in front of that had already been sitting there get there order taken then food delivered.  Another table to the left of me receive their meal and beverages refilled.  So two different servers at a couple different times and two different helpers to bring out food and whatever the tables needed.  I watched tables that walked in after Me get coffee, water, service and their food.  Very unacceptable service.  There was No Communication between the staff.  People looked at me but noone even asked if I had been helped or offered to help. I won't be trying this place again.  Poor,  poor service.
