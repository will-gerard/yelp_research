This was a GREAT experience!!  The kids had a blast and there was even BLOOD and loose teeth!!    I got a great Groupon deal and took the kids and thier friends.  The open skate sounded like it was a short amout of time but it was the perfect amount.    The only complaint I have is the crowded  area in the front was a little frustrating when trying to get to the bathroom!  It's hard to run through people on ice skates when you gotta pee and there are little kids left unsupervised running willy nilly.  LOL  The little food place was nice and the wait staff was GREAT.  And the prices were affordable.   We will surely go out there again and I suggest it to others.

"MEthinks not?"  NO!! I KNOW NOT!!  This Chili's will not get another dollar from my pocket.    I have given them 3 and 4 chances and it NEVER gets better.  Every meal has come to me cold.  The drinks.....BAD. Even desert sucked.  I am a very fair person and I have given them the last chance.    The service is even lacking......the servers spend more time playing with each other rather than doing their jobs.  It is more than frustrating to hear that your food is up and they are giggling about the GREAT time they had the night before in the club's bathroom with some random guy.    While I enjoy a great "club bathroom sex story" like the next girl....I would prefer that I had hot GOOD food while I am hearing about it and trying to explain to my 10 year old that it IS NOT OK to do that!!  LMFAO!!  Again.....don't waste your money, time, or taste buds on this particular Chili's.BUT!!!  If you are looking for a good time story and cold ass shrimp this is the place for you!

Went for breakfast this morning and I am STILL full!! :-) Plenty of food for the price and they have AWESOME old school candy!  There were a million and 42 people there today and we were seated in good time. The service is always good...even if they refill my coffee just after I got it the way I like it with 16 sugars and 6 creamers!!   Good service will make or break it for me and these folks are on top of their game.   And I only had to kick one little old man outta one of the rocking chairs so I could have a turn! :-)

I have no real complaints.  Prices are high but you get what you pay for.    :-)  The employees are ALWAYS friendly and willing to help my daughter whenever she needs it.  THAT IS HUGE!!

We have been here for a private even and for a Motorcycle Race event.....both times we were very happy with the service, drink and food!  We sat at the bar for the races and even there the service was superb!!   Actually thinking of having a private going away party.

I am always happy to go eat here!  Food is yummy and I feel like a complete slob when I come out of there.    Had one HUGE issue tonight. The hubby is on crutches and on the way out one of his crutches slid a good foot and a half on the greasy floor.  Just an FYI....that could have been a EXTREMLY large lawsuit had he hurt his fresh out of surgery ankle because of a greasy floor.  Otherwise very please with the food ad service.

Great Stadium.  There hasn't been a bad seat that we have gotten yet.  Food prices are high but that is to be expected at these types of venues! There are a lot of other events held here and being a closed staduim is great for the AZ HOT weather!

I love this store and they are never lacking for cool things to buy and try!  My kids LOVE going in here and finding new things to learn how to make!!  There is a little lacking in a few of the employees but the others totally make up for it.    Well worth the dollar.  :-)

My 16 year old chose here to eat for his Birthday dinner and it is his choice EVERY time he is given on. :-) The employees never treat the children as if they are not wanted. VERY much a family place as well as being a place that my hubby and I can go and have a night out alone.   The food is great and ALWAYS well flavored. I haven't had a bad meal yet. The beer makes my man happy as well!   We recommend and continue to take family and friends when they come into town.   The service staff is always welcoming and very knowledgeable.

THIS PLACE HAS IT ALL!! My hubby and I love to go in here and get stuff for EVERYTHING.  While we are not hunters we do enjoy fishing, camping and grilling.   I am a s'more whore and they have the coolest STUFF for s'mores!  :-)  LMAO!  There are a ton of stocking stuffers as well for just about everyone!  The only downfall, and not at all the stores fault, is the creepy feeling that we are usually two of the six black people in there at any given time!!  LMFAO!  And there are a lot of guns!!  TOTALLY JOKING!!    The workers there are all very personable and willing to help if needed.    Never left unhappy in that store!

My 17 year old is a MONSTER FAN!!  YUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMM!!! So he gets 3 of the 5 stars.  He would heat there daily if he was allowed to and as long as he had someone paying for it.     Since I am paying for it I will say, I LOVE the drinks. The food isn't above average or really anything to write home about.   The service is a big deal for me and I was impressed with the service.  Our waitress and two others were very friendly and actually kept us giggling through out the meal.  It isn't a top choice on my list but when I am feeling generous I let my son pick the dinner spot. It is better than Chilis or TGIF....but not my top choice of dinner runs.

this store is always a cluttered mangled pile of jewelery! The perfect place for tweeny boppers. My daughter got her ears pierced for her 11th bday (2nd hole) and the assistant manager did a great job and even shoed away the weird older lady failing to be a cheerleader! Thanks!

We came into the country after being stationed over seas for 7 years with 2 dogs.  We boarded our girls there for almost 2 months while looking for a home and getting settled into the base.  They were AWESOME and made the girls feel loved and comfortable.  They walked them daily and let them loose in the clinic after hours instead of leaving them locked in the kennels.  When our oldest came up ill they didn't hesitate to take care of her.  They are kind as well as professional.  A little on the expensive side but truth be told....I wouldn't skimp on my own health care so I wouldn't skimp on my dog's either.    They are worth it!

We went to meet some friends and had drinks while our friends finished dinner.  The server was OUTSTANDING!!!  She knew her job and did it with amazing accuracy! I have not had this kind of service since leaving Okinawa.  The place was packed but we were acknowledged immediatly and there was no issue when we joined our friends. :-)  CANNOT wait to go back for a full meal!!

Always friendly!! The portions are huge! And the prices are right! Don't go Sundays if you don't want a wait! Busssy!  The wait staff are a hoot and always ready for a laugh.  I appreciate the GM being out on the floor helping customers and delivering plates.  Some would just sit and watch.....  Love breakfast and I go here at least 2 times a month.

Dig the theaters...dig the movies....always clean and employees are always nice!  Cons: 1. Can't kick out the snow birds that don't reazile that they DO NOT OWN THE THEATER durring the matinae.  2. Can't kick out the older folks that don't realize that they are not whispering! 3. Have to complain a million times to get the brats that are texting and playing throughout the movie. 4. Can't kick out the loud candy eaters 5. Can't punch the dumb paretn that brings thier 10 year old to a rated R movie and then tries to explain SEX to them durring the movie! 6. Can't punch the dumb parents who let thier kids play all over the theater  I don't think it's right that I should have to pay a million dollars for greasy popcorn, cold pretzles, and 4 gummy worms!   Other than that....I LOVE these theaters!

After 7 years in Oinawa this is the best Sushi that I have had in two years in the states.  The best part...BESIDES the food...was the service.  I have tried just about every type of sushi they offer and even some that the chef experimented with!    Although it is not Sushi from Okinawa, it is a DAMN good runner up!

Sooooo....if I'm feeling saditty this is where I go for too loud music and a lot of sports on multiple tvs throughout! Clean and spacious and the food is yummy despite the occassional grumpy server. Its pricey but that is expected from a 'higher end' sports bar! I don't have any major complaints and I do have a compliment on the great desserts! I am a sweets whore and they fulfill me needs quite well! Great place for a group meet and eat!

Totally diggin this one! Our server was awesome!! She gave some great suggestions and the food......Yum! Wait....different place! Lmfao all seriousness...overall nice experience! Kinda pricey but the service and the serving size makes up for that. The older people behind us even talked loud enough for us to enjoy their story about some fun drunken hot tub times they had last winter! That's what I'm talkin bout! Bow chika bow wow!!

So let me begin with the dessert! OMG! Cheesecake done Greek: TO DIE FOR!!! I have been without my husband for six months and this is the closest thing to a "moment" that I have had!  hehehehehehe!!! I cannot wait for him to get home to take him there if only for the cheesecake!  My meal was yummy as well!! The serving was a great size even if the meal was a little pricy.  I will surely go back there to eat again.    It isn't a place for the romantic meeting due to the closeness of the seating but it is still a great place to dine.

Dinner was good....service was ok. I am willing to give it a second chance in hopes that the folks were just off last night. We saw our waitress 3 times and while she was nice enough....waiting for everything got to be more than frustrating. A bit pricey but if its the name you're paying for.....I guess. Simply put...they MIGHT get one more chance to impress me. But right now.....I'm not even close.

Thank you to the people that work in this Vet hospital.  We went in on a one day notice with our family lab Shadow and they were WONDERFUL.  They were so caring and understanding with her and us.  When it came time to tell us that there was only two optoins in helping our girl they cried with us when we chose to euthanize her.  They were so completely understanding and so kind to let my husband be with her in the end.  They handled it all with GREAT care, empathy, and professionalism. They allowed us to have our Shadow creamated and they continue to treat us with the utmost respect.    We would reccommend thier services to anyone.  They offer payment plans as well as a military discount!  But thier service takes it.  These folks are the best at what they do,

So my husbands is in LOVE with the style of burgers (pastromi especially) here.  They have HUGE servings that I think are worth the value.  Breakfast isn't anything fantastic but it is good.  I am always PLEASED with dinner and the service is GREAT!  The people know who we are and usually guess right what we are gonna order!!!  Love going there and will continue to suggest it to others!

So I REALLY wanted to like this place. On a whim I went with my two children and we were seated quickly.  Then we SAT....and sat....and SAT some more.  THREE servers walked past us before Steve finally asked if our server had been over yet.  And I will say that he was the highlight of the entire experience.   It was MAD loud in there.  The music was loud which made everyone in there have to talk louder to even be heard.   I get employing the younger crowd. But if I wanted to eat with 10 teen agers I would have stayed home and let my son have his friends over. I wasn't sure who even worked there as they were all dressed like they had just left fun time at the park.  Is there no real dress code? I also have an issue with thier language.  I have no issue with people cussing but I do have an issue with a 17 year old girl cussing at another teeny bopper that I guess works there as she was kind of cleaning the carpet with a sweeper, when there are people there with little kids.  When the older couple next to me left without ordering I was ready to follow.  When our food finally came it was ok.  I wasn't hugely impressed by any of it.  I am really disappointed with all of it. I am hoping that the zoo portion is better than that and hopefully the zoo animals get better service!.  Needless to say, the BEST part was our server Steve- Or John if the service sucks.  LOL  Steve, thank you for making us laugh and being the highlight of our meal.

I got a Groupon and took a chance!  I am so gald that I did.  I too got a call that they would be able to come early and they did an EXCEPTIONAL job.  The two guys that came over were super nice and proffessional.  We will be using them again before Graduation visitors come and I am sure a few times before we move out of the rental!   THanks for doing an awesome job and I have been telling all of our friends!
