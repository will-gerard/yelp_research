Very disappointed. I scheduled an appointment and it got switched twice. Every time I schedule an appointment, I always get a call back for reschedule. The excuse they used this time was "the technician was needed for the heavy traffic." This made me feel less important because I wasn't a priority. I wouldn't recommend this place.

Poor customer service! The place was dirty, there were no utensils, no lemon, no forks! Won't come back to this location.

I have been coming to this location for the last 4 years and today marks their 4 year anniversary! I just want to take a moment to give this nail salon a shout out because they absolutely deserve it! The service is phenomenal and the people are beyond friendly. There isn't a time that I leave this place unhappy. HAPPY 4th ANNIVERSARY! I recommend this location to everyone!

I waited in line for 8 minutes with one person ahead of me. When the girl asked me what kind of meat I wanted, I gave her my answer and moved on. The staff was very unwelcoming and the place was filthy.

Scam parking lot. Do not park here. They will cite you even after paying and if you fail to pay, they will add your vehicle on the tow list. I've spoken to a few other people who've had a bad experience with this private business. Leon who is apparently the manager of this business is full of shit and rude. They only take payments by mail and it needs to be cash. Do not park here!

Unfriendly staff. Went there for a birthday and asked for cake slice shots. They were made very sloppy, not looking anything like the menu. They were even missing half the ingredients to make it and didn't care to accommodate. Security at the door was rude and unwelcoming. Girl band was not that great either.
