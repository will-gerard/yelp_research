We love Oscar!!!  Our friend decided to celebrate her birthday by renting a limo for the evening to cruise the Strip. Oscar was ready and waiting for us at the Paris valet at our 8 p.m. pick up time. After opening the door and helping us get settled inside, even offering to open our bottles of champagne for us, Oscar began our 3.5-hour-tour.   We headed down to the infamous Vegas sign first, where Oscar took photos of our entire group. Then he dropped us off at the Mirage to see the volcano erupt and recommended the best viewing spot. We were going to see the Bellagio fountains but decided instead to head straight to Fremont. We spent an hour and a half downtown before Oscar drove us back to our hotel.  Oscar handed each of the girls a single red rose and it was the perfect ending to a wonderful night.   We rented the Escalade limo, which had plenty of room for our party of eight and could have comfortably sat a couple more people. The limo came equipped with champagne and glasses and we brought plenty of our own alcohol along for the ride.   This is a great way to see the sights of Vegas and I highly recommend it! Ask for Oscar!

I'm giving Joe's four stars but that may be a bit a generous. I just feel like three is a little low but my experience was more like a 3.5. Allow me to explain.  My boyfriend and I stopped by Joe's with our friends after going to the nearby bar. We picked up a slice of cheese and a slice of margherita pizza to go. Everything seemed fine until we got home and looked more closely at the margherita pizza. We're pretty sure that instead of basil, it had spinach on it. I've never had a margherita pizza with spinach instead of basil so we're wondering if it was a mistake. I suppose the two green leaves look somewhat similar. And I'm assuming it was supposed to be margherita pizza. That's what we ordered and no one corrected us.  Aside from that misstep, everything else was good. The cheese pizza was delicious, especially topped with a bit of parmesan cheese and garlic. If only we had only gotten the cheese, this may have been a five star stop.

I recently attended a wedding at the Neon Museum and it's a pretty cool experience. The only thing that would have made it better was if we got to see more of the signs. Since the wedding was located just in the lot across the street from the lobby, we only were able to view that section of the museum. Still, there were some cool signs and it's a unique backdrop for a wedding. We had fun checking out the signs and taking photos. I'm sure that their wedding photos will turn out really fun too. I'd love to return to see it in all its glory sometime.

Since I had never been to a wax museum before, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. But Madame Tussauds proved to be a fun way to spend an hour or so on a hot Vegas day. It was fun "meeting" some of my favorite stars, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, my childhood crush! There really was something for everyone, from today's Hollywood stars and musicians to sports heroes and historical figures.   It's a great place to have fun and act goofy by taking photos with the figures. Some scenes have additional props to make the experience even better. There were definitely some figures that looked more lifelike than others and a few that I couldn't even figure out who it was supposed to be.   We stopped by the haunted section, which wasn't that impressive. They had us walk through the dark, twisty path in a single file line and people randomly jumped out at you. Other than that, you couldn't see anything and it wasn't especially scary.   We were handed coupons for $10 off on the Strip and that made the experience much more affordable and enjoyable.

***Private Party Review for Spago***  I recently attended a wedding reception in Spago's private room on the second floor and it was an amazing experience. We were treated to a four-course meal as well as several trays of appetizers and an open bar.   While the room doesn't have much in the way of decor, it was spacious and provided a quiet spot away from the hustle of Vegas to mix and mingle with the 40 to 50 guests of the wedding.   I'm a self-proclaimed picky eater and skipped the passed appetizers, which included spring rolls, crab cakes, lamb, mushroom and goat cheese flatbread and calamari and shrimp flatbread, but my boyfriend liked the mushroom flatbread. Honestly though, it's a good thing that the appetizer selection didn't appeal to me because I was stuffed after the four-course dinner.   Just a reminder, all of our food was selected off the private dining/catering menu and not the regular restaurant menu.   First, we started with a Green Goddess Salad, which included butter lettuce with avocado and green goddess dressing. I'm not sure what green goddess dressing is exactly but it's delicious and I may have to look for a similar type of dressing to use at home. So good!   Our second course was gnocchetti with beef bolognese sauce. While I'm not typically a fan of ground beef in my sauce, I was able to push the larger chunks aside and the gnocchi was wonderful. My boyfriend, who is a vegetarian, was able to get a non-meat sauce with his. If I had been thinking more clearly, which alas I was not due to the open bar, I would have requested the same.   The main course offered a choice of scallops or New York steak. I chose the steak and boy was that a great decision! The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and had great flavor. The little potatoes that it's served with were also wonderful and I was very appreciative that the waiter was able to serve my plate without bacon as I haven't eaten pork since I was 10 years old.   Finally, we ended the meal with a caramel cheesecake, topped with a scoop of coffee ice cream. I'm strange, I know, but I can't stand the taste of coffee and the ice cream ruined the cheesecake for me. But I was already so full that I wouldn't have had room for it anyway.   All in all, despite my fancy food reservations, it was a great night filled with great food and service and I'd recommend giving Spago a chance for your next big event. I looked it up online and they have quite an extensive list of choices for the courses so you can make your own menu,

The only reason that I am even giving the Rainforest Cafe two stars is because the ambiance is hard to beat. Who doesn't want to eat in a rain forest with trumpeting elephants and hollering chimps!?!  Unfortunately, I didn't even get to eat here on my visit. My friend and I attempted to stop by on a Friday afternoon. We were seated relatively quickly and then forgotten about. We sat there for a good fifteen minutes and were never greeted by a waiter. No water, no food, no nothing! We finally just got up and left.  Sorry Rainforest...but you lost our business!  On a side note, browsing the menu for 15 minutes allowed me ample time to decide that the food is ridiculously overpriced.

Oooh! Looks like I'm review #1,000!  My boyfriend and I came across a Groupon for Spice Market and decided to purchase the buffet option. For $43, two people get all-you-can-eat-and-drink (including beer, wine and champagne) brunch. There are also breakfast and lunch options for weekdays but the dinner choice is currently sold out.  I'm giving Spice Market four stars based on the alcohol (bottomless mimosas...hell yea!) and the incredible dessert station. The rest of the buffet was decent but probably three stars at best.   Things I loved:   The cupcake selection was phenomenal! There must have been about 12 different varieties of fancy cupcakes. I tried four (cookies and cream, chocolate mint, caramel apple and smores) and, like a little piggy, almost ate all of those four cupcakes. My personal favorite was the chocolate mint (super creamy mint frosting) but all four of them were incredible. If only I had more room in my belly!  The prime rib was great! Perfectly cooked and tasted like perfection when dipped in the au jus. I enjoyed two slices of the tender meat.  The mac and cheese was surprisingly good. I've tried it at other buffets and always find it to be bland but here is was perfectly seasoned and I even went back for seconds. The chicken pesto pasta from the Italian bar was also a tasty dish.  Things I Didn't Love:  The fresh-sliced turkey was dry and the gravy had a funny taste to it. I love turkey and gravy so this was big disappointment.  The salad bar was very tiny. I know that not a lot of people go for salad at a buffet but I always like a little salad to go with my meal. I guess it makes me feel slightly healthier while gorging on all the deliciousness. But there were very few toppings and the ranch was not to my liking (I'm very particular about the ranch dressing at restaurants).   The mashed potatoes, which I admit that I didn't even try, looked incredibly runny and strangely yellow. What happened to fluffy white potatoes?   One other quick note, if you have a group of 8 or more, they charge you a mandatory 18% gratuity. We, of course, had exactly eight people. I think this is crap as it is a buffet and they're not really doing much for us aside from pushing a couple tables together. And if we had seven instead of eight, they wouldn't charge us? Seems a bit ridiculous!

On our last morning in Vegas, my two friends and I decided to stop by the Venetian to eat at the Grand Lux Cafe before driving back to San Diego. We wanted to fill up on some yummy food and be able to make it home without stopping to eat. Boy, did that plan work!  After looking through the massive menu (you can tell this place is related to the Cheesecake Factory, so many choices), I decided to order the Chicken Parmesan lunch special. Advertised as a lunch sized portion, I figured it would be perfect for me to eat and not have too much left over. I'm still trying to figure out who the portion was meant for...a 300-lb man, perhaps? There was no way this little lady would ever be able to eat this in one sitting! In fact, I brought it home and made two more meals out of it!  That said, the chicken parmesan was wonderful! Unlike others that tend to be dry, this was moist and flavorful. The pasta needed a bit more sauce for my liking (I like it dripping in it), but the waitress happily brought me a side of marinara. Priced at $13 or $14 (I can't remember), it was a great deal!  Be prepared to wait awhile for your food but at least they offer complimentary bread and butter to snack on.

I admit that I might be slightly biased because my group of girls was lucky enough to be invited to join a table of very nice, very rich Canadian gentlemen but my night at Tryst was awesome!  After wandering through the club and becoming increasingly annoyed with the crowds and my high heels, one of my friends was approached by a bouncer who asked if she would like to join the table. She quickly rounded the other four of us up and we preceded to hang out with a couple of fun guys for the evening. These men had a large table near the center of the dance floor and the cushy red velvet seat was exactly what my sore feet needed to dance on. We had the absolute nicest server who we all adored. She made sure that we always had a drink in our hand. Even when I was starting the night slow (still recovering from night one of the trip), she offered me a water. When I eventually started drinking, she poured me a glass of Dom Perignon and later brought over shots of white gummy bear. At one point in the evening, I thought my purse was stolen (we later found it had fallen between the cushions on the couch) and she dropped everything to help me search. The bouncers were also super nice and made me feel very safe.  The hip hop music was just what I needed to let loose and dance. And the gorgeous waterfall background was perfect!  I'm nearly positive that had we not been invited to join this table, my night would have been far less enjoyable but as it stands, it was one of the best nights ever!

A dinner here is never second best...after all, miss, this is France.   I sang this song in my head for the entire meal at Le Buffet. The ambience of this French themed buffet reminded me of Beauty and the Beast. Unlike most fluorescent lighted buffets, this buffet is beautifully decorated. It's like eating in a French village under a lovely clear blue sky.   The food is good and a step above traditional buffet foods. The roast beef and prime rib were both wonderful. The crepe station is awesome! What could be better than a fresh made crepe?!?   At $30 for dinner, it's a little pricey but what buffet in Vegas isn't anymore? Next time, I'll be sure to take advantage of the $45 all-you-can-eat in 24 hours deal, which included six buffets in the Harrah's family of casinos.

I'm surprised by the low rating for the MGM Grand Buffet. Sure, it's insanely overpriced, like every other place in Vegas, but the food was good and there was a large selection of items.   In particular, I was impressed with the assortment of meats. From the carving table you could chose turkey breast (moist and delicious!), prime rib (amazing!) and tri-tip (decent but not my favorite). There was also made to order steaks and crab legs for the seafood lovers.   In the middle sections, there were a variety of side dishes. My personal favorites were the mac and cheese (very cheesy and so much better than any other buffet mac and cheese that I've ever tasted) and roasted potatoes.   The salad bar was small for a buffet but I guess paying the higher prices, you'd want to fill up on other things anyway.   My friends all gushed about the dessert bar but seeing as my sweet tooth is barely existent, it didn't entice me. There were quite a few choices for those that do like desserts though.  Thankfully, my friend and I received a $75 food credit for staying at the MGM and that pretty much covered the Friday dinner buffet. If I were to come back on my own dime, I would definitely try the lunch buffet, which is almost half the price.

As a country girl at heart, I loved Gilley's! My boyfriend, two friends and I visited Gilley's on a Saturday night. To make the evening more fun, we decided to go all out and dress up in our cowboy and cowgirl gear. Boots, hats, flannel shirts and jeans! There were a few others in full-on country wear too.   We first entered the bar side through Treasure Island. As we were planning on having dinner, we were stumped by the lack of tables. After wandering around for a few minutes, we learned from the bartender that there was another half that held the restaurant. We put our name on the wait list and got a table within 20 minutes.   I ordered the 8 oz. flat iron steak with sides of two-cheddar mac and cheese and buttermilk whipped potatoes. The steak was cooked beautifully to medium rare and the mac and cheese was wonderful. The potatoes were decent but could have used a bit more seasoning. My boyfriend had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with french fries. While I can't vouch for the sandwich (I don't eat pork), the fries were delicious dipped in ranch.  The food isn't cheap ($20 for the steak and $15 for the sandwich) but the atmosphere is fun and the service is good.

Last time I visited Gilley's I came to eat in the restaurant, this time I came to hang out in the other half of the building with the live music, dance floor and mechanical bull.   I'm not shy about being a country music lover and as far as nightlife goes, this is definitely the place for me. It's not too crowded, there are actually plenty of seats and the dress code (if there even is one) is more boots and flannel than high heels and dresses.   On Friday night, there was live music, which was nice. The singer covered many popular country songs, from the classics (Johnny Cash) to modern country (Jason Aldean) and fast-paced dance tunes to slow songs.   But when the singer took a break and the recorded songs came on, I found it odd that non-country songs were mixed in. This is a country bar after all and I came to listen to country music.

While I didn't eat much here, I accompanied a friend who had just arrived in Vegas and snacked on a few of her fries. The fries, which were more like jojos, were delicious!  But the best part about this spot is that it was one of the few quiet places on the Strip to just sit back and enjoy talking to a friend. Nothing fancy but perfect for what we needed that night.

It's no secret that I'm obsessed with the Coffee Bean and this location in the Miracle Mile shops at Planet Hollywood continued my love affair.  I stopped in for my signature drink, a large pomegranate blueberry iced tea latte, before hitting the road for a five-hour drive back to San Diego.   My aunt sent me a virtual gift card to the Coffee Bean for Christmas and I've yet to find a location who knows what I'm talking about when I show them the barcode on my phone. I'm blown the minds of two baristas at my local San Diego store when they scan the code and it actually works. I told this Las Vegas location about it and showed them the code on my phone but instead of scanning it, they tried to punch the number in. When this didn't work, they offered me a discount. Since the prices are significantly higher at this Vegas location, the discount made the price about equal to what I pay for the same drink in San Diego. It dropped from $6ish to $4ish. Talk about great customer service!   By the way, if you've never tried the Pomegranate Blueberry Iced Tea Latte before, I highly recommend it. It's definitely a sweet treat that's like a bit of heavenly dessert!

Unbelievable. That's the best word I can use to sum up our experience at the Trump Hotel. And I don't mean it in a good way. We had such an unbelievably bad experience that I can't even begin to comprehend how things could have been this ridiculous. It was so terrible that we never even made it to a room and thus this review is based purely on our attempted check-in experience.  We arrived at the Trump around 12:45 a.m. on a Friday night. After sitting in two hours of barely moving traffic en route from San Diego, making our five hour drive a seven hour drive, we were exhausted. All I wanted was to relax in a nice, comfortable bed and regroup for the next day. Instead, we end up sitting in the lobby for not one, not two, but THREE hours! Here's the story:  We check in at 12:45 and the front desk says it will be 15 to 30 minutes until our room is ready. This in itself seems ridiculous. In a hotel with over a thousand rooms, how do they not have a single room ready for check in? Plus, we had booked our room in advance. Check in is around 4 p.m. It should have been ready hours ago! But we decide to take it all in stride and go to the bar for a drink.   An hour goes by. We go back to talk to the man at front desk. He apologizes and assures us that our room will be ready shortly. He says that we are fourth in line and the cleaner was in our room at the moment. He offers us $25 to use at the bar and an additional $50 on our room key once we receive it. He also says that he would upgrade our room to a suite at no charge.  At this point, it's closing in on 2 a.m. By the time we get to the bar, it was closing (didn't realize bars closed in Vegas) and the bartender offered us free beer for all the hassle. We continue to sit in the lobby, along with several other groups of people, and time continues to tick by.   Around 3 a.m. we go to the front desk again. The line takes about 30 minutes, as there are already several complaints in front of ours. We finally find out that there was a "situation" and our room is still not ready. They can't tell us what the "situation" is or explain how a single "situation" could cause us to wait for a room for three hours. We finally were offered a room at the Palazzo. The Trump arranged for a car to drive us to the hotel, which is a couple long Vegas blocks away. But before we could leave, we had to reclaim our baggage, which had been loaded on a cart to take to our room. When we asked for our baggage, the girl instead brought our car, which we were going to pick up the next day.   Eventually, after 4 a.m., we were dropped off at the Palazzo and were able to check in and be in bed by 4:30 a.m.  I have no idea how a hotel can be so incredibly disorganized and deceitful. We didn't appreciate being lied to on several occasions about when our room would be ready and it was absolutely ridiculous how they didn't have a single room ready.   Needless to say, we won't be returning to the Trump Hotel.

I've heard many a story about the Earl of Sandwich and am so happy to have finally tried this delectable sandwich shop for myself. Delicious!!!  My friend and I walked to Planet Hollywood from the MGM simply for lunch at Earl of Sandwich. While waiting in line, I perused the menu and decided to try the Full Montagu (subbing extra turkey for the roast beef). The warm bread, turkey, cheese (Swiss and cheddar), lettuce and tomato were all fresh and complemented each other perfectly. The "mustard sauce" that comes on the sandwich seemed a little too sweet (perhaps honey mustard) so I added a bit of dijon from the table and it added the right amount of kick. I'm not usually one to eat my entire meal in one sitting but it was so tasty that I couldn't put it down (plus, my room didn't have a fridge so I didn't have much choice...no way I was throwing this out!).   At $6.50, the price was very reasonable, especially for a spot on the Strip in Vegas. I added a bag of chips to my order for $1.25 (also a great price!.   While the restaurant looked crowded, they are very efficient at moving the line through quickly. Order at the first stop, pay at the second and then you receive a beeper for when you're sandwich is ready for pick up.   Only downside is that the closest Earl of Sandwich is in Anaheim at Downtown Disney. But on the plus side, I have a Disney pass and hope to stop by on my next trip north!

Love, love, love the Palazzo!  A couple weekends ago, I visited Las Vegas with my boyfriend and a couple friends. We were supposed to stay at the Trump but after a terrible check-in experience (as in we never got to check-in after waiting three hours), we were moved down the Strip to the Palazzo. Thankfully, the Palazzo quickly erased our irritation and replaced it with a smile and sigh of relief. It took only 15 minutes to complete check-in and arrive at our room. Another 10 minutes and our bags are being delivered at the door. We finally crashed at about 4:30 a.m.   When we awoke the next morning, we could finally take in the beauty of our room. Our two queen bed suite was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was especially gorgeous with a separate shower and bathtub, and my boyfriend loved the TV in the bathroom. The sunken living room gave us room to spread out and the remote controlled blinds were a nice touch.   The location can't be beat with a nice air-conditioned passage to the neighboring Venetian and it's directly across the street from Treasure Island. We easily walked to Caesar's Palace in less than 10 minutes and made it all the way to Planet Hollywood on foot in less than 20.   My only minor complaint is the lack of free wi-fi. Seriously, $15 a day!?! I think with how much the rooms are there, they could comp the wi-fi. Thankfully, I was able to take my laptop down to the coffee shop on the second floor and hook up to the wi-fi for free.   I will definitely keep the Palazzo on my list of favorite Vegas hotels!

I love my Mexican food but I don't love overpriced Mexican food.   Recently on a Vegas trip with some girl friends, we stayed at the Luxor. As we were still recovering from the night before, we decided to make dinner easy and just head downstairs to T&T. I understand that we were on The Strip in Vegas but $13 (before tax and tip) for a chicken quesadilla is pretty ridiculous. There was nothing special about it and I only ate about half before I couldn't choke down any more cheese.  The chips and salsa were slightly better but I would have preferred a traditional red salsa instead of the green salsa and the chipotle (I think?) salsa.   I'll save a few bucks and pass on T&T in the future.

After staying at the Aria for two nights, I can honestly say that I have no major complaints. The hotel is beautiful and, after staying at several of the older hotels on the Strip on past visits, I really appreciated staying at a newer hotel where everything looks sleek and modern. And it's quite hi-tech too! As soon as we walked into the room, the blinds automatically opened, the lights turned on and the TV welcomed us with some relaxing music.   We stayed in a king room and the bed was so comfortable and luxurious that we didn't want to return to our old queen bed at home. There were plenty of pillows, which I loved, as it added to the cozy feel. I'm obsessed with the automatic blackout blinds and want my future bedroom's window blinds to open and close with the press of a button. My only small complaint about them is that they're not flush with the wall so some light did slip through. If you're a sleeper who is sensitive to light, like me, you may want to bring a sleep mask or plan on burrowing under the blankets when dawn arrives.   The bathroom was probably one of the nicest bathrooms that I've seen at a hotel. The bathtub in the shower stall was an interesting design but worked out well. I managed to take two baths during my stay and the deep tub was super relaxing and a great way to soak your sore muscles after walking around Vegas. It was also nice that the toilet has it's own door from the rest of the bathroom although a little odd that it's frosted glass so you can still see the outline of the person. I was staying with my boyfriend so it wasn't a big deal but it may be strange with a friend.  I wish Vegas hotels provided a mini fridge in the room. We had beers and ciders to chill and I ended up dumping a bucket of ice in the bathroom sink instead. It worked but it also would have been nice to have a spot to store leftovers and snacks.   Everyone was really nice and the maids and maintenance workers greeted us each time we passed them in the hallway. We should have taken advantage of the Do Not Disturb button because we were "disturbed" around 10 AM both mornings. First by someone who said they were there to pick up our room service tray (we didn't order room service) and second by a maid asking what time we were going to check out. Seeing as we didn't use the Do Not Disturb sign, I'm not going to hold this against them though.  The central location of the Aria is great and we were able to easily walk to Caesar's Palace and Planet Hollywood. The restaurants at Aria are a bit pricey but you can find cheaper options at the Miracle Mile, which is only a ten minute or so walk away.   Overall, it's a great hotel and definitely one that I'll be keeping in mind for future Vegas visits.

The Aria Cafe is neither good or bad; it's simply there. I'd give them a solid 2.5 star. When my boyfriend arrived back at our hotel room after going out with the guys around 12:30 AM, he decided he needed a bite to eat. The easiest thing to do was head downstairs to the cafe and, considering that it's Vegas and fair bit of alcohol had been consumed earlier in the evening, this was really our only choice.   There's an abbreviated menu for late night dining and we didn't have a lot of choices, especially for my vegetarian boyfriend. We ended up ordering a plate of nachos and a ginger ale for him. The nachos, which rang in at around $15 for a plate of chips, cheese, jalapenos and a scoop of sour cream and guacamole, really weren't worth it. The $4.50 glass of ginger ale was probably the highest priced soda that I've ever seen. I guess I just expected the hotel cafe to be slightly less insanely overpriced than the fancier hotel options. After all, it is basic cafe-style food.

Both my boyfriend and I love Thai food. As luck would have it, there was a Thai restaurant located in the Aria and we decided to make it our last meal in Vegas. It was a great decision and I highly recommend giving it a try.  I stuck to my usual order of chicken phad see ew. Oddly, the menu only lists three meat/veggie options for each dish and the phad see ew only offered a choice of pork, seafood or veggie. For comparison's sake, the phad thai listed chicken, shrimp and veggie. I decided to take a chance and inquire about substituting chicken instead and they easily made the change with no questions. I'm not sure why the menu only lists certain protein options for each dish but I was pleased to see that they're not strict on that.   My phad see ew was absolutely delicious. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say it's one of the best that I've ever eaten, which is a good thing as it's also probably the most expensive at $18. While it was a little hard to justify spending nearly twice as much on the same dish, the quality of the food and the ambiance of the restaurant made it worthwhile.   My boyfriend ordered the home style tofu with rice at a spice level of ten. Our waiter warned him that it's extremely spicy but my boyfriend grew up eating New Mexican green chiles and always asks for high spice levels at Thai and Indian restaurants. He's usually disappointed that they fail to reach his desired spice level but the spiciness here is no joke. He was pleased that they actually lived up  to their warning.   I also decided to splurge on a Thai iced tea and it, too, was very good and gave me the caffeine burst I needed to make it through the rest of our final day in Vegas.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated and would make a great date night spot with the dim lighting and quiet setting.

I admit, we didn't do the Sugar Factory the right way. We arrived after breakfast (ends at 1 PM), which meant no sugary french toast or pancakes, and we ended up with standard lunch food. The white pizza and french dip were good but I know that's not what the restaurant specializes in. We should have ordered sweets and next time I fully intend to do so.  The dessert menu is substantial and several things looked good to me. The Smores crepe, apple pie waffle and dark chocolate fondue are all on my must-try list. Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I have completely opposite tastes in desserts so I'll have to return with a friend who would like to share.   As is usual on the Strip, the food is a little pricey. Between $15 and $20 an entree.

My boyfriend was craving a breakfast sandwich and I suggested checking out the Earl of Sandwich. Since we had already spent quite a bit on lunch the previous day, we were looking for a more affordable option. When we discovered that the Earl quit serving breakfast at noon (and it was 1 PM), we ended up across the way at PBR Rock Bar. Stumbling upon this ended up being a pretty good Vegas find.   I figured that I had already eaten enough junk for a week in my first day at Vegas so I decided to be good and order a salad. As soon as I noticed that PBR offered half salad orders, I was completely sold. Thank you for offering an option for lighter eaters! I can never finish a full restaurant salad and not only do they not typically hold well as leftovers but many Vegas hotels don't offer refrigerators to store leftovers either. Finally, I can confidently order a salad and know that I won't be wasting half of it. Also, by ordering a half salad, my Country Fried Salad decreased from a ridiculous $17 to a much less intimidating $10. The salad is topped with chicken tenders, tomatoes and cheese and I asked for the cucumbers and bacon to be removed. I also asked for a side of ranch instead of having the salad tossed in honey mustard. I'm not a fan of pre-tossed salads as they tend to get soggy. Although I thought the ranch was quite good at first, it lost some of its appeal throughout the meal so I know it wasn't quite the normal restaurant quality ranch that I love. Even at a half size, I could still barely finish it and I can't imagine what a full-sized salad would look like.   The Tex-Mex Scramble ended up catching my boyfriend's eye and he chose that over the intended breakfast sandwich. The eggs with pepper jack cheese were served with tater tots and toast and it seemed to hit the spot for him as a great hangover food option.   I noticed when I checked in that they were offering a Yelp special of buy one, get one drinks. Since my boyfriend claims that beer helps him get over a hangover, he was more than happy to partake in this deal.   Our waiter was a little odd and very chatty but I think he meant well. He seemed like the type to get nervous, such as when our food was taking awhile to come out, and then talk to much to overcompensate.   We also had a photographer stop by our table to take pictures and then, of course, try to sell them to us. At first, she offered them for $20 for two framed photos. When we said no, she then offered just the photos for $10. Normally, I'd still say no but the photos were quite good and it was a vacation so I ended up taking her up on the deal and finding my own Vegas frame in the Miracle Mile Shops.  Overall, I was very pleased to find a spot on the Strip with at least some more affordable food options and I'd definitely considering returning on a future trip.

Honestly, this review is mainly based on the fact that the chandelier looks awesome. It's such a unique design for a bar that you just have to stop in for a look if you're near the Cosmopolitan. The crystal-flanked outside (which is inside the hotel) makes for a great photo spot.  I'm personally not a fan of drinking at bars in Vegas because of the ridiculously overcharged prices. Some of the girls that I was with ordered a glass of champagne for $15 and it wasn't anything special. But if you are in the mood for a drink and have the money to burn, this would be the spot to do it. Where else can you say that you sipped champagne in a chandelier?

Overall, Marquee is an awesome club and for my first Vegas club experience, I was impressed. Ironically enough, many of the clubs pros can also be cons however.  Such as the multiple rooms and unique layout. Very cool and interesting while sober but extremely difficult to maneuver and keep track of after a few drinks. It's great that there are a few different settings to fit people's individual preference. We briefly walked through the hip hop room, which was small and packed, on our way outside. In November, it was quite chilly so we quickly headed upstairs to the main room. Then we wandered up even more stairs to the library, which had a nice, laidback vibe, which I would have liked better had there been a place to sit. As the night progressed and I had a few drinks, I found that locating the nearest bathroom and then finding my way back to my friends was a nearly impossible challenge. Luckily, I somehow managed to find my way but it was not without difficulty.   I know there are plenty of people who like the techno/house that's played in the main AKA largest room but I've never been a fan. I need words to get into a song and dance. I remember excitedly shouting to my friend when a song with words finally blasted after an hour of steady beats.   We were lucky enough to 1) get hooked up with free entrance by a friend's promoter and 2) be welcomed to someone's table for the night. I guarantee that my feet would not have survived an entire night of standing in heels so a huge thank you to the guy who let us crash at his table!    Another interesting note, there are a lot of stairs, including a random, vacant stairwell up to the club. Makes for an interesting evening for girls in high heels.

This is one of those instances that I wish half stars were available as I don't know that Sugar Factory quite deserves four stars but I think it's better than three stars.  I've been here twice now on separate Vegas trips. My first visit was for brunch about a year and a half ago but I seem to have skipped the review that time. From what I can recall, the meal was good.  I returned to the Sugar Factory for dinner on Friday night. My boyfriend and I were in Vegas for the weekend for a friend's birthday and we began our trip with a meal here. After finding out that there was a 30 minute wait for a table, we decided to keep our seats at the bar and order from there.   The menu is quite extensive but the baked mac and cheese caught my eye. I love homemade mac and cheese (not Kraft) and I was hopeful that this dish would satisfy my carb craving. Plus, we had just driven six hours in the rain from San Diego and nothing sounds better on a rainy day than something hot from the oven. Thankfully, the dish's flavor did not disappoint. I dug into the edge of the bowl and everything was hot and delicious. But my boyfriend took a bite out of the middle and found that it was just lukewarm. He got the bartender's attention and she quickly took it back to the kitchen and brought us a fresh, piping hot mac and cheese within minutes.   My only complaint is that $17 seems a little ridiculous for pasta and cheese, even in Vegas. We also upgraded to include two slices of garlic bread for $3 extra but I didn't think the bread was that good or very garlicky.   We also got a couple drinks, a beer and a pink moscato, which were both $8. The moscato was perfectly sweet and bubbly!

The hardest part about ordering from Metro Pizza was deciding which of the amazing-sounding dishes to order. While I was tempted by the pizza and pasta, I ultimately chose the Ranch Chicken Salad because 1) I had a heavy lunch already and 2) I read another review that raved about their ranch dressing. I'm known to be selective about my ranch so reading the review that claimed that their ranch is nothing like Hidden Valley (because that is NOT ranch...bleh!) sealed the deal. The salad was huge and plenty for two meals, if not three, for me. It's topped with chicken fingers, tomatoes, mozzarella, cucumbers and croutons and comes with a hunk of (sourdough?) bread on the side. I asked for an extra side of ranch and was so happy I did as soon as I discovered the absolute wonderfulness of the ranch. Definitely one of the better ranch dressings that I've ever tasted and I'm very thankful for the other reviewer for describing it in such a perfect way. This is true restaurant quality ranch.   My only slight complaint is that in addition to the lettuce, which is stated on the menu, the salad also included spinach. I can't stand spinach and had to created a reject pile on the side of my plate as I uncovered spinach leaves. Also, I'm not a fan of cucumbers but thought I could easily pick off the slices so I didn't make any special requests. Of course, though, in this case the cucumbers were finely diced and more difficult to remove.  Although we ordered our food to go, the restaurant looks like a charming place to eat and I'd be happy to make this a regular stop if I lived in the area.

Denny's has always been my drunken guilty pleasure. There's just something about the greasy diner food that hits the spot so a location on Fremont Street is perfect!  I stumbled upon Denny's while looking for a spot to grab a late night bite to eat and I was immediately sold. I asked for an order to-go and told the hostess that I had about 15 minutes before I needed to be back at the limo for my ride back to the Strip. She assured me that she would tell the kitchen to put a rush on the order and, sure enough, it was ready in plenty of time.   As I was looking at the menu, I noticed that the infamous seasoned fries were missing. Instead, there was a choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries. But I asked the hostess and she confirmed with the kitchen that they do still carry the seasoned fries. I'm not sure why they're not listed on the menu but I really hope that Denny's never gets rid of them. They are my favorite!   The seasoned fries paired perfectly with my bacon-less Super Bird and the hostess even threw in two containers of ranch (score!). The Super Bird tasted so incredible that I've been busy trying to recreate it at home for lunch all week. Definitely one of my favorite sandwiches!

After years of watching the gondolas on Vegas trips, I finally caved and paid the $16 admission. My boyfriend, two friends and I opted for the indoor canal ride as it was over 90 degrees outside and that seemed a little too hot to be enjoyable. The indoor ride was relaxing and would have been romantic without all the tourists. Our gondolier sang a song in Italian, which was a nice touch. Maybe sometime I will try the outdoor ride and see how the two compare.

After strolling around Fremont on a rainy day, we were ready to dry off and get a bite to eat. At the suggestion of our friend and local Las Vegas guide, we headed over to Nacho Daddy. I honestly think that had she not suggested it, I never would have noticed it. Not only is it off a side street near Fremont but it's also not flashy like many Vegas restaurants and we almost walked by it.  The inside is simple but what the restaurant lacks in decor, it seems to make up in quality of food. Everyone was pleased with their dishes, from quesadillas to burritos to nachos.  While I was tempted to order the nachos, I knew that I could never finish a plate of nachos on my own. It's too bad that they don't offer half orders of the nachos. Instead, I chose the chicken quesadilla. It was one of the best quesadillas that I've ever had. It was filled with gooey cheese and juicy shredded chicken and served with a side of sour cream, guacamole and pice de gallo. Had I not been on vacation, I would have been content to eat half and take the rest to go but instead I forced myself to finish the quesadilla and was pleasantly stuffed for quite awhile.   Two of my friends shared the Fiesta Nacho and managed to clear the plate between the two of them. These nacho plates are definitely something to share with a friend though, unless you're a super heavy eater. Another friend ordered the vegan burrito and I was impressed that a Mexican restaurant offered several vegan options.   Compared to places on the Strip, prices at Nacho Daddy are very reasonable. My quesadilla cost about $12 with tax and tip, which isn't much different than what I pay in San Diego. The nacho plates ranged from $7.50 for cheese nachos to $16ish for nachos with meat and lots of toppings.

For my first dining experience in Phoenix, Derby impressed me. From the looks of the Yelp reviews, Derby has only been open a month or so but you couldn't tell by dining there.   Everyone was helpful, from our waitress who checked in on us multiple times to refill our drinks to the manager who kindly changed the station on our booth's personal tv. Speaking of which, having an individual small tv in each booth was a nice touch, especially for game days when you may just be wanting to watch one game that isn't the "big" game of the day.  For dinner, my boyfriend and I ordered three of the side dishes:  the sweet potato gnocchi, curly fries and a side salad. We had a large lunch and were looking for something to snack on. This was the perfect solution! The curly fries were deliciously crispy and went great with ranch for dipping. The side salad was a good sized portion of mixed greens, which made me feel better about eating the curly fries. My boyfriend and our friends loved the sweet potato gnocchi.   In addition to the many televisions throughout the restaurant, there are also other ways to entertain yourself. There are games, including checkers, Jenga and cards, to play at your table as well as skee-ball and darts in the back of the restaurant.   The decor is nice and I loved the look of the sunken bar in the middle of the restaurant. The waitress' houndstooth patterned outfits were super cute too!  My only complaint is that it gets loud, at least during game nights, but that's to be expected and not really the restaurant's fault. Just a warning though.
