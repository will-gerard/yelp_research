A friend has an Honda Accord with well over 150k miles. The car runs well, but every dollar spent on it besides gas gets evaluated. When one tire had excessive wear she decided to call around for process on a used tire. Woody's said they a couple to choose from at a price that beat all the others.  I went with her to make sure she was getting a quality tire. Woody's had a couple tires to choose from. I checked the manufacturing date on what looked like the the better of the two tires. It was only 7 months old! They mounted it, repaired a small leak, mounted it again, verified no other leaks, balanced it and put it back on the car in less that 15 minutes.  For less that a third ($35) of what she paid new for each of  the other three coincidentally matching tires, she left a happy person. That was now 4000 miles ago and the tire had been great.

Scottsdale does a nice job keeping this park busy with activities. The only more popular park in Scottsdale is the Civic Center Mall/Park. I have been here in the spring for the well attended live music in the park and recently just attended Railfest. A great and out of the ordinary gathering of train enthusiasts.  I have also taken friend kids here for the large play area under the shade structure. As an added bonus the park has a reasonably priced concessions area. It has also has a great and heavily reviewed trains stem to ride.

I had not found a new dentist since moving to the Valley of the Sun. But, I have always taken pride in my smile. So, I finally scheduled an appointment. I liked how the office is conveniently located in Scottsdale just East of the 101 exit and Shea.  Unlike some other doctors' offices, I only had to wait a couple minutes before being taken back for my cleaning and exam. The office is filled with warm and friendly employees. The cleaning by the hygienist was gentle, but through. Dr. Schwartz was very knowledgeable and willing to answer all of my questions.  I would recommend this office to anyone looking for a new dentist. I know I will back in 6 months for my next cleaning.

I have been to a few performances at the coliseum. I am generous at giving the facility 2 stars.  Concerts have issues with the sound of drums and cymbals bouncing off the back wall. General admission to the performances is free with admission to the state fair. So, I usually catch a couple concerts each fall. The bathrooms are interstate truck stop quality. Clean, but still extremely dated and usually without hand soap.

Terrible!  Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of McDonalds. My Mom actually worked for them as a the pubic relations director for a large franchise owner in the Midwest. However, this also means I know a McDs should be run when it comes to customer service.  I was driving by this location. It is newer location design and I had a coupon, so I swung in to try out their new sandwich. It was early afternoon and there was no line. After placing the order I saw the total was wrong.  The total was not the coupons price or the regular price with tax. I mentioned this to the register person, and she said she had to get her manager to fix the total. It happens sometimes, I understand that. However, when the manager came over, she cleared the charge on my card, handed me back the coupon and basically said 'go away'...   Wow...  I was shocked and left.  The feeling I was left with was so sour, it led me to go online and fill out the McDs customer survey.  In hindsight, it does not sound like much, but it was more of her attitude that left me dumfounded. The "I don't care about your satisfaction as a customer or as a person" attitude. I also understand that this is in a lower income area of Phoenix. However, I was dressed in business casual attire and was friendly to them.  The manager needs to be demoted or sent back to training.  Reading the other profile shows how much the poor attitude of a manager can create an workforce where no employee cares.  I will never visit this location again.

Great place to start a night out in Old Town Scottsdale. Reasonable beer prices, drinking games, and Jello shots. I personally love the cheeky attitude of this place. From the birthday drink served in a toilet plunger to the 'mini bar' tended by and built specificity to size for Chewy the Rock and Roll Midget.  They also host relaxed and free block parties for drinking holidays like Halloween and St Patrick's Day. If you want a relaxed place in Old Town, check this place out.

Stopped in on a Sunday night, no teams were playing, yet there were around ten people gathered around the large bar in the middle of the room. Seasonal Christmas lights crisscross the ceiling. This place gives me the instant impression of my Midwest roots small town bar. Clean, non-pretentious, bar to grab a drink. I did not try out the food from the kitchen, but the menu again echoed the friendly, small town bars of Iowa. We had a pitcher of Shock Top and a round of shots. The bartender, Colin, was great. Helpful, social, creative, everything one looks for at this kind of casual bar.  It was a good night. The kind of relaxed night that is looking for.

I am one on those people that Chinese food is a take out our leave it option. I like it, but never crave it  This place is my go to local Chinese food place for take out. It has large portions for an average price.

This is an unusual place. A delicious unusual place. It is often confused as just an Italian grocery. At least that is what I thought as I drove by many times. Now it is my go-to for Italian takeout. (It also has an eat in deli style seating blended in between the grocery shelves) I have tried a wide variety of their items. From sandwiches to pasta and even their cannolis. Everything was delicious and tasted freshly made unlike the Olive Garden variety of Italian restaurants. What makes it great, however, is their prices. Their rates are great considering the quantity and quality of the food.

I call it Chicago deep dish pizza.. They call it Chicago stuffed pizza. Either way it is the closest to the Windy City pizzas I love found in the Valley of the Sun. They have gotten a little more expensive, since I first started enjoying this pizza a decade ago.  I either go with the Numero-Uno (a reference to the famous pizza at Unos and Dues found downtown Chicago)  the spicy chicken stuffed pizza has also been delicious when in the mood for variety. This is still a wonderful destination for tourists, locals and anyone craving a delicious, stomach filling meal.

I have been to Philly and had the cheese steak there. This place does its best to replicate that in the Valley of the Sun. Even the interior of this location has the interior feel of an east coast, Italian, fast-casual restaurant I like their topping bar to pile up your cheese steak with just the right about of peppers.

I like this library for many reasons. I enjoy the new movies and all the TV series they have for loan. Who needs Netflix when you have free libraries? They also have a great selection of music CDs. Some other items of note for this particular location: There is an interesting at gallery space that is always nice to walk thru. The children's book area are has a huge castle facade that a few friends recall fondly from their childhood.

I am only going to focus on Old Town as a dining and bar destination. It is many more things; boutique shops, art galleries, high end hotels, restaurants and even some multi family housing. It also includes the most high end mall in the state, Scottsdale Fashion Square.  Old Town is the nightlife center of the Valley of the Sun. I think this was best demonstrated when the Super Bowl was in town. The game may have been played in Glendale, but the celebrity parties were in Scottsdale. Over the past several years I have seen various celebrities out at the clubs in Old Town. I have seen our hometown celeb, David Spade, out over holiday weekends like Easter and Thanksgiving out in Old Town. Other celebs I've spotted out over the years are Charles Barkley, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudemire, Mike Tyson, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Kendra Wilkinson , the Kardashians, Dennis Rodman and Frankie Muniz (now living in the Valley.)   In March, during the Cactus League Spring Training, the bars are filled with groups of mostly guys that are in town to watch their fave teams play during the day and hit Old Town clubs and bars at night. You will also run into the occasional player or team scout.  The dining options are a mix of local and chain restaurants. The original PF Changs was actually located in Fashion Square Mall.

I used to come here before the remodel. It is now updated to a nice, slightly upscale feel. It also now has a small eat in area near the in store Starbucks and deli counter and free WiFi.  The other item of note if the incredibly helpful meat/fish counter staff. They have sent me home cooking recommendations and even with spices and other toppings to make my grilling taste delicious. This location is slightly father than the Old Town Fry's a mile from my home, but when I have the extra few minutes, I chose this location.

I like Fry's food for having the best grocery prices on average in the Valley. However, this store makes you feel like the prices should be cheap, because it is in desperate need of a renovation.  The rumor is renovations will begin after the SuperBowl leaves town and the renovation is expected to last for almost a year since they are not closing during the process.  Nothing is a stand out at this location. The newly renovated Fry;s 2 miles south of this location is a much better choice. There are all the major grocery stores within 4 miles of this location, Bashas. Safeway, Albertsons, Fresh and Easy, AJs and even Trader Joes. If it were not for their great sale prices, this store would be low on my preferred grocery list.  My biggest complaint of this Fry's and actually most of the Fry's Food Stores is how often their best sale items are out of stock when shopping there on the way home from work.  Some tips:  They have a new very tasty Kroger brand lime flavored tostitos chip for $1/10oz bag. Also, if you properly register your Fry;s card, Fry's will mail you coupons targeted to your spending habits and often include a coupon for a free item.  Speaking of FREE, they have been having a Free Friday Item, that if you go onto the app or online on a Friday, you can load a coupon for the free item of the week. Seniors (over 55) on the first Wednesday of the month receive 10% off with their registered Fry;s Card.

Update number 2.   Last month I moved again. I avoided the June heat by moving in December this time. I liked the prices and the trucks at Budget the last two times I had rented there, so I went back for a third time.  I should have stopped at two. I made online reservations and lined up moving help for a Saturday morning. I arrived at the Budget Truck Rental about a 1/2 hour before closing.   I was next in line when I received a call. They told me did not have a truck for me. Then, the person went ahead and rented the truck I had reserved to the person in front of me in line. I was shocked and angry to say the least. I personally think they wanted to rent it at full rate instead of the 20% discount code I used online.  I called corporate and since no other trucks in the area were available in the area I had no truck to move the next morning.  When moving you make plans, and one of the biggest ones is the truck you are using to move. If you can't depend on online reservations, the whole system breaks down. Budget corporate did nothing to lessen my frustration at what the local agency did.  Tip: There are always discount codes online and DEFINITELY call ahead to confirm your online reservation before driving over to pick up the truck.

This review is specifically about their food tent at the Tour de Fat. I bought a whole pepperoni pizza from Boulders on Broadway. It was extremely blah. The standard thickness crust had the flavor interest of Wonder Bread. The sause was barely noticeable. The only thing to add any flavor was the few pepperoni on each slice. I love pizza, however, this flavorless pizza barely meets the definition. I will never order this item again.

A sports bar... A casual bar.. The Well Bar...  home of cheap day drinking during 'power hour' and the Oregon Ducks.  Morning Power Hour runs from 10am to 11am everyday and afternoon Power Hour weekdays from 3pm to 4pm. $1 Well drinks and $2 imports and premium drinks. Great place to watch games (especially the Ducks) or play pinball, darts and pool. It has friendly bar staff and friendly regulars. Come in and meet a few.

Worst pizza I have ever had.  I love pizza. The old adage "even bad pizza is still good" does not apply here.  I had a $4 slice of cheese pizza here after an evening out in Old Town Scottsdale It looked like any other generic walk-in, buy by the slice pizza place. However, the pizza tasted like homemade Playdoh. No real flavor to the sauce or cheese, just over-salted, undercooked, terrible tasting dough.  Blech....  Not good... not cheap... not ever coming back...

I have only been here during the day having stopped in to meet a friend for a drink. During that time, there is usually one or two other patrons at the bar.  However, recently I stopped on a Saturday night around 11pm. Wow. What a change. The place was packed. Three bars open and a DJ. It was a very ecclectic crowd. There was what looked like a wedding partying post reception, a mix of 20-somethings playing bar games, and range of ages from 21 to 70+ on the dance floor. As I said, eclectic.  I had a good time, and I will be back when in the mood for a busy, reasonably priced, Old Town Scottsdale bar on a weekend.

I came in for my birthday free meal. The cashier (Bryson) was particularly helpful. A meal is always just a bit better when the employees seem to be enjoying their job.  I ordered the Baja Combo plate. A burrito, a fish taco and beans/chips side. This location seems to be a notch better at the size of the burrito. I generally substitute black beans for both the side and on the burrito. It was as tasty as always, but I find I need to add some of their salsa to add to the general flavor. As a side note, Rubios picante salsa is terrible, however all of the other fresh made salad are enjoyable.  I came with a friend, and the food was more than enough to split for lunch. Its location is convenient for parking, but it is busy and can take a few minutes to get the fresh made food.

WOW!  We went there for their 11th Anniversary party on Sunday. Climbing was free all day. They had face painting for the kids and a bounce house. Pita Jungle catered the free lunch and for desert they brought in an ice cream truck. It was definitely a birthday party atmosphere. Which apparently they host children's birthday parties too.  I had been to a few climbing places, but I was impressed by the design of this location. It was build with the feel of a canyon and not just a simple climbing practice wall.  Thank you AZ on the Rocks. You went above and beyond.

Hotel 'club' with $10 cover.  Only worth it if can't get to to bars in Scottsdale Old Town. Better choice is to Uber to old town and go to real clubs there.  The best thing to say about this place is the view. But, really does not represent what the nightlife in Scottsdale is all about.

I have been to Stand Up Live a dozen times and was also a regular at Tempe Improv.  I go to comedy clubs for the comedians. For that reason, I chose Stand Up Live as my favorite comedy venue in the valley even before Tempe Improv closed. It just brings in the best quality comedians on a regular basis. The opening acts are as strong as their headliners. The interior has an upscale look and feel. Like any restaurant, if you get there early enough and do not like the place they are seating you, ask for another seat. I am 6'5" and do not mind the tight seating. Comedy clubs are about laughing along with your neighbors, not being irritated by every little thing. Drinks are not cheap, but are in line what I would expect for a comedy club. Most beers are in the $6-$7 range as I recall. The same as what I pay in Old Town Scottsdale and cheaper than what you pay in most cities of Phoenix's size. Get on their email and texting list. They occasionally send out limited free ticket offers (2 drink minimum rules still applies) Even on these nights, the comedians have  been great, even if lesser known.

Well, after visiting twice over the weekend and three times since the new year, I figured I had better add my review to the pile.  It has a causal, very dog friendly vibe. The kind of place that fits perfectly in the Arcadia neighborhood.  On the Friday night it was busy when I arrived there with friends around 8pm. A nice mix of locals and tourists ranging from dressed up to casual.  The crowd died off around 10 or 11pm.  On Sunday afternoon, the back patio was full of people. The access to the walking trail along the Indian School Canal pulls people in, especially if out waking their dogs. This place has water dishes and free dog treats. As I mentioned, VERY dog friendly.  I came for beers with friends, but we had some food too. The flatbread was good with an appreciated, slightly flaky crust. The other food items were also enjoyable as batter than average bar food fare.  TIP: Happy Hour is Monday through Friday from 11am until 6pm. All Arizona pitchers of beer (about 2.5 pints), all glasses of wine, and all house specialty cocktails are $6.  By the way, in March they are opening a third location in Paradise Valley at the intersection of Tatum and Shea.

What I look for in a gas station is good quality gas at the cheapest price.  This location has consistently been some of the lowest price gas in the valley since it opened last year. I use the GasBuddy app to locate the low price gas in my area. Again today, this location came up as the lowest in all of Phoenix at the moment. Cheaper than even ARCOs that I avoid because I prefer to use a credit card.   I have used QT gas since I started driving in Iowa. I have never had a problem.  It is also conveniently located just off the 51 at Thomas Road.

Consistently lower prices than neighboring gas stations. That is the reason to choose it.   However, I wish they had windshield washing solution and a squeegee. I also wish they took more credit cards, but understand it is part of low cost.

From what i can tell, The Yard is the part complex under the VERY large shade structure once housing a motorcycle sales floor. It has upscale seating area with a garden party feel next to a playground area with corn hole, ping pong, shuffle board and a foosball table. It will be a great place to share a few drinks with friends or make a destination for a day's bike ride.  It looks to be eventually the shared open space for a collection of Sam Fox restaurants. Currently, there is only Culinary Dropout. But, we were told an oyster bar was coming soon.   It also has a unique restroom layout that may throw you when you first enter.  It is a welcome addition to uptown Phoenix.

Friday night, four of us went to the pre-opening event at Culinary Dropout benefiting Local First Arizona. The place has a wonderful upscale, casual feel were you would be as comfortable in a business suit or shorts and flip flips.  Prices were what I expect from the Fox Restaurant Concepts. The most expensive entree on the menu was the Korean Style Ribeye Cap. I had the Shaved Prime Rib Dip. It was a solid, tasty sandwich, but I felt it was a bit pricey at $17.  Their posted happy hours are Monday to Friday 3pm to 6pm. Several of their sandwiches and appetizers are $3 or $4 their regular prices. Mug beers are $3 and well drinks are $4.   I will be back, likely riding my bike over with friends for a few $1.95 brown bag mystery beers and a few games out in "The Yard"

This is a typical, minimal frills gas station. It has 8 pumps and very rarely a line. The gas price is usually exactly the same as the Circle K across the street which is usually some if the cheapest gas prices in the area according to the Gas Buddy app. I stop here to use my Fry's Grocery gas discount. However, unlike most Fry's Gas stations, the two nearest actual Fry's Grocery stores are both a mile away in opposite directions. It's clean. It's quick. It's convenient. What more do you look for when getting gas?

I come here about once a month for a pasty. They are reasonably priced and a nice alternative when tired of pizza or burgers. However, one of the biggest draws for me if that it is open late. Even if the social hub of Scottsdale Old Town, most kitchens close around 10pm. Cornish Pasty is open till midnight.  I have tried most of their pasties. I have yet to have a bad one. However, a few could use a bit more spices.  I also wish they had a reverse happy hour starting around 10pm. It usually has less than a dozen in the restaurant when I have been there late night. I think this place could be more popular with its relaxed patio would be great for a casual drink with friends at that after 10pm window.

I received a postcard in the mail for a free birthday entree at this location (up to $20 value). We started with the nachos. I have generally been disappointed by nachos at restaurants lately. Usually just a bag of chips with just a few toppings tossed on before heating. I was glad to find this pub style restaurant makes them the way they should be. Every chip with at least some delicious topping on it. We split the entree, a grilled salmon and asparagus risotto. It was delicious. They kindly split it into two plates. It was devoured quickly. In general this place has a great English pub feel. However, I still prefer the one at Tempe Marketplace just a few miles away. This is a great place for a lunch or early dinner while shopping at the state's top mall. It will also be great when the new Harkin's Theater opens a few hundred yards away. But, when looking for that destination dinner the stand-alone Tempe location is my preferred choice.

If you are here for spring training or a parent with a child playing on a team, this is the store to find that unique, stylish baseball themed attire. I was here for the store's grand opening. They were giving away a free cactus league cap with any purchase and the line was well out the door. Yet, even with the overwhelming crowd, the employees were still helpful and friendly. Bottom line, if you are a true fan of baseball or shopping for one, this is the clothing store for you.
