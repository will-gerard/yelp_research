This is a great location for my family.  Every time we go,  there are staff who are happy to help and super friendly.  We are asked several times each visit if there is anything we need help with.  However we did have one experience in the paint area where it was slow to get service and when we did,  the employee was cold.  I do not know if this is how the paint staff is at this location,  but if it happens again,  I will be sure to let management know.

I have been here several times.  I don't personally like it but my husband likes going here for steak.  The place is very crowded and cramped. When I am ordering, the waitresses always give me several additional options of how to have the food (ie potato) but states it as a run-on so I am always confused where the break is.  The last time we were there,  I ordered a sweet potato (planned to give to my 11 month old).  The waitress listed 6 toppings, without breaking.  I said I wanted the minimal.  I was given a sweet potato with 3 unnecessary toppings.  They had a high chair for us but it was far away from the table and had very loose straps that didn't work for my daughter. I ended up having to keep her in my lap during our visit.

I only have been here when others I am out with pick it.  If it was my choice,  I would steer clear.  The prices are higher for mediocre food.  The lighting is too dark for my preference.  The place has many Sun City residents visiting/long waits to get a table.  No point doing a call ahead,  you still wait (we called ahead but waited 45 minutes after our time slot). And the staff rush you through so that they can get the next group through.

Like the other person previously, I also purchased a Groupon for Bloom. However, unlike them, I did not experience the same issues. I did first try calling on a Monday but the voicemail. When finding out their hours, I learned that they are closed on Mondays and Sundays so that is why. I was able to leave a voice message but decided to call again another day. I called the next day and spoke to Steven. He was friendly and helpful. I scheduled my appointment that coming Saturday.  The salon does allow scheduling online but both the groupon and the website clearly state that this option is not available for those with groupons. The Groupon also stated that specific stylists were not available for the groupon, which makes sense (and makes sense why it would be best to call in for the appointment as they can make sure that error does not occur). I arrived at the salon and was greeted by a smiling female who immediately assisted and told me an estimated wait. I was called back within 10 minutes, which was before my actual start time (I liked this because I hate waiting around and I very much value time). My stylist, who was Steven, was very friendly, listened, and did a good job on my hair style (spent about 45 minutes with me). The salon has a comforting atmosphere and layout. They offer several services too - hair, nails, and even spray tanning.

My family and I enjoy this place.  The environment is very nice.  It is comfortable,  friendly, and very welcoming of children.  When we went,  management had walked around (several times)  and checked in with guests.   The waitresses we have had did seem somewhat new at it but are very friendly.   The food is not top of the line but it isn't like we went there thinking we would get that.  I like that their menu offers a nice variety of foods to choose from.   My family and I plan to return to this location,  which is conveniently located!
