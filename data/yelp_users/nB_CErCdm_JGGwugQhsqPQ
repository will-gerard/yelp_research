Great first time experience at a barbershop! Had tvs playing espn while you wait and had a lot of guys working so it wasn't that long. The guy who cut my hair really took his time and did a great job. Will be back!

I have never been dissapoInted while eating the MEXICAN food here. The food here  is cheap,, beyond delicious with extremely nice and good hearted employees. I love it here, definitely better than it's sub-par sister restaurant Serrano's owned by the same family.

This pub is on the end off Mill... So for those who can make it past all the bars through the block lies this gem. It's signifigantly less crowded than any other bar on Mill, serves my favorite beer (Magners), has a huge outside patio for socializing however still has local bands play inside some nights. Very chill place, absolutely love it.

We've been taking all of our yorkies there for a while now and they always come out great! Always super friendly too and the pups never look traumatized afterwords like they have with some other groomers in the past.

The best dive bar! Great specials, okay service. Have plenty of TVs including a projector but kinda small so everything is centralized. Easy to have a great nignt under $20

So what happened to others happened to me. They took my name and number and told me 20 minutes. They have no place to sit and wait so I walked over to Starbucks. The short haired girl said shed call me... Im still waiting for that call. They were the only ones open late so thought id give them a shot. Guess not.

Their number one with BBQ pork spare ribs is by far their best entree and one of my favorite meals! Besides that everything else is good.

Been here more times than I can count. If it's your first time get the steak sandwich and a mimosa!

Way better than I expected when I heard "all the toppings you want for no charge". In fact, it was out right delicious!

Wtf is with the parking? The scottsdale one is worth the drive still... The burgers are good yet over priced. Typical chandler atmosphere...
