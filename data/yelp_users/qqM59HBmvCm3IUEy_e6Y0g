For a Thursday night, I'm happy to find a place that serves food after midnight. HOWEVER, I've never had such terrible service, not just from an individual server but from everyone working there my first (and last) night in. Our server looked at us with a blank stare and lacked social skills, which wasn't the worst part and can be totally excusable. What shocked me was that we went from one rude bartender to another. The blonde bartender spoke in an insulting tone and was not happy when we ordered waters, after previously ordering drinks and attempting to order more. After her rudeness she passed us along to a different bartender who was equally as bland. Hanny's has the appeal of a really cool, urban spot, but don't let the appeal fool you. You'll get terrible service and pretty much pass out trying to use the restroom because it is beyond disgusting. Hanny's invest in better employees and adapt to this century's sense of hygiene.

First off, the bartenders Eve and Craig are two of the best people I've met and my favorite bartenders. They actually remember your names and their drink service is spectacular. Sidebar has a really fun and unique cocktail list. If you don't know what to get, try the White Rabbit. It won some award but is yummy, it's basically a white Russian with Rum Chata but better. SideBar is a cool lounge type of bar in Downtown Phoenix and is a great place if you just wanted to grab a drink before an event downtown or to spend some quality time at after dinner. My boyfriend and I went here on New Year's Eve, I couldn't decide what I wanted so I told eve I was thinking grapefruit but also was feeling for some champagne. Bam, like a liquor wizard she made the perfect fruity holiday drink good enough for a celebration. That night all of the bartenders were wearing metallic tattoos, I complimented on it and Eve offered to give me one too. So right at the bar she dabbed on a metallic tattoo, just show how awesome SideBar and its employees are.

This is my go-to spot for perfect nails and to destress. It's in a great location and all of the employees are just so talented at making art out of your nails. They're super sweet too and always remember that I like my nails square but they can't be sharp because of my puppies. I've been coming here for months and no longer try any other place. They truly are Top Notch!

This was such a fun spot to go to after an event at westworld...We loved our server Alex! She was so nice and easy to talk to and was very well put together. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our dinner and drinks and will definitely be back! I expected the usual bar type of food but Twin Peaks' menu was way better. Good food, good people. Thanks Alex for the awesome service!

I always look forward to going to the mall just to get dessert at Macaron Cafe. They have more flavors of macarons to choose from than any other place I know. I love the creme brûlée and pb&j flavors. Seriously so delicious, so fresh and fluffy! Their cute packages make for great gifts too. Worth every buck! Yum!

My boyfriend and I are Ruby regulars. At 7:30pm they pull into their spot at the car wash on Thunderbird just west of the 101 and you can expect them to be there for you until about 11:30pm-midnight. We crave their tacos throughout the week and have them for dinner at least once if not twice a week. Can you blame us? They're delicious and the price is amazing, $1.50/taco. We get 3 tacos each, chips with pico de gallo and guac and have our filling, amazing, best tacos ever dinner for $10. When it's not freezing we usually eat there at the food truck tables, but in the winter we call in our order and just pick it up and go. Ruby and his daughter are the nicest people to work the truck and I've never been disappointed with anything on their menu. Even though I usually stick to tacos, it doesn't hurt to add on a perfect churro or switch it up to a quesadilla or burrito. Yum all the way!
