Clean, great service, great smiles, and the cooks know when it's time to take it off the grill... Eating breakfast starting my Saturday with a great Denny's start thank you.

Real deal mechanic, honest, and informative. I wanted to get a new muffler for my Rhino and it was in really bad shape and he gave me good advise and recommendations without pinching my pocket.

This place make all Genghis gills look and taste bad. I have been to a few locations and was a hard core happy rewards card guy with a glass beer mug and this Genghis suck! I moved and this is the closest one. The cooks burn the food every time and the host are always confused. Great business but very bad management.

It's been over a year since I have been to this place once I have loved before. There is a new management team and you will notice a big difference. The cooks and the team are a lot nicer and understanding and the food is great. I had a bowl, drink and dessert. I like this a little more then how it was with the old management. I will be coming here more often now that the treatment is better.

Polish culture always have great taste in furnishing comfortable atmosphere. This place says a sleek all the way. Inside or outside the place is roomy, great for family invites. Polish country know their vodka and this place has a bar that has pulsating cool color changing lights, good to mention polish ladies carry them self well. Fast service and the food came out fast. I ordered the cordon-blue, salmon burger, and a bunch of sides but no pierogies (none till next week...?) I enjoyed the food but have no credit due to my knowledge polish/Swedish food.

I really like this place it keeps getting better and better. The story is that the chef here was rewarded best sushi chef in Japan.. The real deal and his dream was to open the best in USA and do the American Dream. I am very fortunate to have the food here before they get too busy.

It's a no go at Isolutions, they were rude, unprofessional, unexperienced, poor workmanship and never finished the job but made it worse. Brought it to corporate Apple Store and apple wouldn't touch it because it was too damaged by Isolutions. They have a fine print on their writing when u sign it, says "if they damage ur product... They are not responsible..." That's bad business and bad service for us as clients. Don't do it, don't use them. Read the other comments that gave them bad ratings...
