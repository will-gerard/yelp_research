Haven't eaten BK is a while. It's greasier than I remember (i.e. Chicken fries). I tried the tender grill chicken sandwich - it was falling apart, soggy and not at all tasty. My hubby's burger wasn't that much better.

First time here, and great food.  Had a couple lunch specials with the hubby and it was delicious. We will be back.

Can't say more than what has already been said.  A warm, cozy place. With fresh, homemade food. I'm not polish, my husband is, and we both loved it. We'll be back soon.

**UPDATED**  I haven't even stayed yet and I am thrilled. I made a reservation yesterday online, but had to change dates today. When I called to make the change, it was hassle free and the customer service rep was friendly. I am THRILLED!  ** I had a great time.  The accomidations were clean, modern and in great shape.  Hotel staff was a little lacking, but still a good experience.

For the price, it wasn't worth it. Yes the servings are massive, but the sandwich doesn't include anything but the meat on bread. I ordered the corned beef, and had to pay $3 for a small serving of coleslaw and $1.50 for Russian dressing, so that there was something on the sandwich. There were a lot of fatty pieces in the sandwich also, not very appetizing. PLUS, my husband ended up getting sick from his lunch, since his brisket was very greasy.

I heart Ikea. Nothing like getting some furniture and stopping for some Swedish meatballs while your there.  I love wandering around for ideas too.

It's too expensive for just okay food. I had a steak last time and for the price, I could have had a better steak at Black Angus or surf and turf at Red Lobster.

I've gone a few times, ordered something different each time, hoping that something stood out as good. No such luck. Lasagna, manicotti, and of course pizza. Nothing was that good.

Dr. Syms was referred to us by another medical professional, whom we like and trust. Our first few experiences did not go well.  The first visit we arrived at 1:30 for a 2 o'clock appointment. We were seen at 4. The second visit was for a 2:45 appointment. We arrived at 2:30. We were seen at 3:45. An HOUR behind schedule at the least. I heard another patient in the waiting room singing the doctor's praises AND mention how busy he always is. For my daughter, he looked in her ears and told us that he couldn't do anything to determine the cause of her hearing loss until she was 1 year old. But he wanted to see us at 6 months ... (to bill my insurance I'm sure) he said it was to make sure we don't slip through the cracks. So we were scheduled for appointments where no further assessments were done. That doesn't make any sense to me.  More annoyingly, Dr. Syms has a poor bedside manner, Lucian Leape would be outraged. As a concerned parent, I want a person to address my concerns and give me information. He isn't friendly and isn't forthcoming with info.   Why more than one star?  His office staff has always been friendly and helpful.

I recently bought a certified pre-owned Tacoma from Camelback.   Aside from the usual used car tactics, their support staff needs improvement. When I got the truck it was late at night, so my husband brought it back later in the week for it to get "detailed." He waited for two hours and when he went to ask how it was coming, they didn't know they had the car. Then I came back a week after we first took home the car. I was dropping of the check from my bank. I was trying to give them money for a car I already took from them. It took 45 minutes for someone to collect the check, when it took less than a minute to look at it and say everything was good. I understand that we've already "completed" our business, but Camelback Toyota needs to work on their follow up.   Next time I'm going to Avondale Toyota.

Great Harkins. They keep it clean and they always have plenty of theaters for the more popular shows to avoid crowding. The draw-back, if you order any hot food (like the mini burgers or fries) it takes a while ... it's a shame, I like me some chicken fingers.

Delicious BBQ! Tangy rich sauce and fresh hot meat. Friendly people. And who cares if it's Styrofoam and paper towels vs china and linen napkins: the food is great, who cares what it's on. I had the chopped pork with beans and fries. Kids had pork rib tips (awesome) and a really well prepared hot dog off the kids menu. My husband got the sampler. If you aren't really hungry, it's a meal for three. It's a great idea for your first visit (with two people). I will be back.

This is the second time I've been here. And it was the second time the person at the counter helped the person BEHIND me. And they never appologized. The only reason they didn't get one star is because they have good tea.  Since rudeness is not isolated, I won't be back.

This was a great show! A lot of great songs we all know and love with an amazing story. I bought the CD of the Broadway Cast recording when I left, and I preferred the Vegas casts' performance.

I love this Target.  Clean and well lit. Pharmacy staff is excellent and friendly. I've never had to wait in a long check-out line - if a line develops, they always get more people on registers.

My preferred Thai restaurant. Very tasty. Accommodating staff. My husband orders the sweet Thai basil fried rice and adds the Chinese sausage - and it's amazing.  I do masaman curry chicken, it's brilliant.  My only issue is their hours. I went elsewhere this weekend because the other place was open at noon and Sala was not open yet.

Stumbled upon this place when I had to get my car fixed. And went back again when I took the car back, again. Good pizza, tasty sauce and crust. Had a pasta dish and again the sauce was great, fresh mozzarella. Decent wings, but for the price, they're good. I'll be back, even of my car isn't broken.

Went on a Friday around 4 in the afternoon and it was all but empty. Some happy hour. Anyway, the Mongolian beef may have actually been horse meat, maybe rabbit. It was nothing I've ever tasted , but definitely not beef.  The appotizers were the kind you buy frozen and drop in the deep frier, and even for that genr√© they sucked.  Oh, and it was dirty. The table clothes had stains from their crappy sweet and sour sauce all over them.  I am always looking for good Chinese - I didn't find any here.

Delivered my twins there and it was a wonderful experience. The nurses and doctors were wonderful. As a first time mom I was scared and had a lot of questions, they took the time to help me and work with my husband and I. If you can choose your hospital when it comes time to deliver, choose Banner Del Webb.

Delicious pizza, Take-and-bake. Call ahead and pick it up on your way home from work. Ingredients are fresh. Pizzas are assembled to order when you call. Lower calorie options. Vegetarian options. Good for even the pickiest eater.

I have no problem not going back to see a doctor, so when I say I've been going here for years, it means something.  Dr. Teresa Malcolm is my OB/GYN and I started seeing her for my regular annual visits.  She helped treat me when I was struggling with infertility.  She referred my husband and I to a fertility specialist who was successful.  Now I am seeing Dr. Malcolm pregnant with twins.  She is great.  Down to earth, caring and of course, a mom herself.   Recently I had to see another doctor in the practice, since Dr. Malcolm was on call that day. I saw Dr. Fara.  He is excellent too.  Sociable and concerned, despite me not being one of "his" patients.  I live in the West Valley, so driving to the North West Valley is a trek for me, but the quality of care and of service from the ENTIRE staff is so excellent, they are worth the trip in my opinion.

Great medical office with great staff! As a fist time mom, of twins, I have a lot of questions for a lot of concerns. Dr. Mark Pyle and his staff have been helpful every time.  They answer questions, take the time to work with you and make themselves available. When I call with a concern, I've been able to talk to the doctor every time. I am so impressed with their level of care and customer service.  My husband and I will be switching to see the family practice doctor there, and leaving IMS.

I enjoy this restaurant. Very pleasant people. And more importantly, tasty food.  I always order masaman curry chicken from any Thai place. Their's is delicious.  Why not 5 stars? I'd prefer they skip the cabbage leaves in the curry. And the potatoes tend to be under-done (maybe par-boil them first, then finish them in the curry?).

I've had Italian beef in Chicago. This is the real deal. They serve Vienna Beef hotdogs too, so they are serious. This place is clean. Friendly staff! Always enjoy going in!

Fresh quality, ingredients. Friendly staff. I've come twice and haven't been disappointed. Came as a family both times, brought a friend the second time. Dinner time wasn't too busy, but still lively. Lunch is great. I am a fan of an open burrito. My husband does a wet burrito. Kids do quesadillas. Fresh guacamole and chips made in house.
