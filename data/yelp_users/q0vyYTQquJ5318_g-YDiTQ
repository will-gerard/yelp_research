Love this place! I eat here religiously since I work nearby and I love the Korean spicy beef.! It's amazing and always tastes great. Place is kind of small but I usually don't dine in and order take out. Definitely recommend if you love noodles

Very good steak gyro wrap! The bread was the best part and tasted fantastic! My new gyro spot in az. Also it's a good amount of food given so you're full when you leave

THE Best coffee spot in Arizona! They have awesome coffee and it is way better than any commercialized coffee such as Starbucks...I had the cappuccino and it was perfect right on the dot! This place is kind of hidden but once you find it you'll keep coming back for more!

Best steak ever and one of the best Restsurants in Vegas. I would recommend sitting outside because of the waterfall and show that they play while you eat. Definitely will be back

My favorite sandwich shop near biltmore. I get the tuna or the turkey, they're both good.

Been wanting to come here for a while and finally stopped in earlier this morning. I got the number 20 and it was pretty good. The potato salad on the side was okay, nothing special. Overall it's a nice place, food is good, but I feel like the portions are small.

Not a 5 star place but a 4 star for sure. The food is good and I especially get the salmon bowl which is great compared to the restaurants near by. Not too crazy on the seating but it's okay

I was refereed to this place from a friend and decided to check this place out yesterday. It was a very nice looking spot but I had my order to go since I was at work. I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was bomb! Definitely going to come back.

First off I want to say that I've been to the other barber supplies and it was not a pleasant experience. Very shady environment and aggressive sale tactics.   However, my experience at Rubinov's has been completely different. Joe and Mike (the owners) spent almost an hour showing me products as well as recommending razors and blades. I bought a couple of shave sets today for last minute Christmas gifts as well a new razor and aftershave for myself. This is a hidden gem in Arizona and I'm glad I found them.

This is an awesome spot! I've always driven by this place and wondered if it was worth stopping in and it definitely is. The girl at the counter was very helpful and polite and the breakfast burrito that I ordered was very good. I like the ambiance of this place and the location so I'll be coming in quite often.

Let's start off by saying the shop is real nice with the decor but that's not all that counts when you are in need of a good haircut. I decided to yelp for a local barber and these guys popped up. My usual barber that I go to down the street was out of town so I decided to give these guys a try. The guy was clueless on how to cut my hair and took almost an hour to cut it! I get a medium taper and scissor cut all around and he left everything chopped up and uneven. The taper was also dirty and not blended well. The barber cutting my hair was continuously staring at my haircut and looked lost. Would not recommend if you want a good haircut but I got to give to them that they got a nice shop. That's the only reason why I'm leaving 2 stars other than that It would of been 1 star. Local barber you have to keep up with the trendy styles. These Russian barbers from New York seem to know a lot more than you guys.
