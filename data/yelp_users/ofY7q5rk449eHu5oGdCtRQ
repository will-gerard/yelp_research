It's hard to find a mechanic you can really trust. The team at 180 is efficient, professional, smart, friendly and honest. I also like that the business is woman-owned! And the lobby makes my living room look sad. It is big, open, comfortable with snacks and Keurig coffee pods, books and magazines, etc. Honestly, it is always a pleasure to go there - even if the reason why I have to go isn't always great.

In the last year I've transitioned my two cats to grain-free food, and now my 12-year-old dog as well. While the food is more expensive, you really do get what you pay for! My animals are much healthier and we are all happier. Rhonda, the owner, is great at offering advice and always is ready with the free samples. Plus, my dog was experiencing seizures recently, and after I switched to a more natural dry food and wet food, and of course got her on medication, the seizures have disappeared! One day I was short of the wet food, and I used a bit of the old wet food, and low and behold, she had a seizure a short time later (after days of no seizures at all). I really do feel that commercial food is cutting our furry friends' lives short and will only do a natural and healthy diet from now on. And after much research online, I was happy to find that Kodi's carries one of the brands I was interested in. And if she doesn't have it, Rhonda will order it for you! It's great to work with a local business and an owner who really does care about your pets.

I've been going for more than six months now. I have always had issues with stress locking up my shoulders and neck. I used to go to a chiro regularly when my insurance covered it, but my new insurance didn't and the out-of-pocket price at most places was just too much. At The Joint, I get a professional adjustment and consultation for a really great price, and I'm happy to say my back and neck are on the road to recovery. I think I need regular massages to deal with the muscle tightness in the shoulders, but that's next on the agenda!

I went there for the first time on Saturday afternoon just by chance. It wasn't busy (yet - but started to fill up for the UFC fights later that night) and I sat at the bar. The waitress and bartender were both friendly and attentive. I tried the beef cheek taco, the pork taco and the duck taco with flour tortillas and enjoyed all three immensely. With a Dr. Pepper, my total bill was $12, and I was perfectly full and content. I didn't realize this place has a reputation as a "party" bar but I can see, with all the TVs around the bar, it probably gets nuts on sports nights. But if you just want to go and have some really tasty and affordable gourmet tacos, I recommend going for lunch or an early dinner and avoiding the crowds.
