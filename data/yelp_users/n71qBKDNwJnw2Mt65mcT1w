We were pleased and disappointed at the same time. The service was good: people knew their stuff, and if you asked further questions they had answers.  But, our table was full of crumbs that didn't get swept up  - what's up with that?! Every course we had was delicious. Beautiful foie gras, heirloom tomato salad with a black ice dressing that was a great treat, BUT, my rib-eye was tough!!  Gristly and hard to cut and chew. Incredibly disappointing for the quality we were expecting. That's why this 5-star restaurant only rates 4 stars from us.

We do not recommend using Stonebridge Manor for your wedding, or any other event.  Our wedding planner contacted Stonebridge to set up a tour of the grounds, and told them that we were two brides looking for our venue.  Their answer was 'no problem'.  We arrived at the appointed time, and looked through the venue.  Beautiful grounds, no doubt, though the front is noisy from the street noise.    However, as we got into the conversation, I asked them explicitly if they had ever hosted a commitment ceremony.  Their response?  "Oh, you're doing a commitment ceremony.  We don't allow nonlegal ceremonies on our property."  Excuse me?  Your website says NOTHING about this.  In fact, it explicitly says "holiday parties" or "corporate events" (which clearly have no legal basis).  Lots of stuff about weddings, but nothing about the fact that you don't allow same-sex couples to use your property.  In this day and age, I'm horrified at the homophobia displayed by this organization.  I wonder if they allow Bar or Bat Mitzvahs to be celebrated there?  Those aren't legal either....  Sadly disappointed.  I cannot recommend using Stonebridge Manor, and I also cannot recommend using any of their recommended vendors either.  I wonder if those vendors know how homophobic this organization really is.

I like this place but it's over priced!!! The waittress should have realized that there were other ways to price out grilled chicken and salad than to charge me $20 for French fries I didn't want!

This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants. Salad is great. Having s choice of quinoa pasta is great and their cappuccino pie is to die for!!! Make reservations in the winter or expect to wait!!!

I love Chompies! I come here about 2 times a month. It's the only Jewish deli in my area. I have to admit that sometimes the service is less than stellar but the food is always good.....

Unfortunately, I came to have lunch this past Wednesday, and a very large cockroach ran by our table while we were perusing the menu. After that, my friend and I just could not eat there. Please clean this place up! It would be a shame if it has cleanliness issues that are pervasive!!!

I've finally found an Indian restaurant that I can repeatedly go to! I haven't had Indian food since moving here as I was told there were no good places to go. The buffet at lunch was very good!

I am not a fan of the taste of the gluten free bread but everything else is just fabulous!

New Salon where T3 used to be...some of the same stylists and a great owner.   http://www.ahwatukee.com/money/article_4ea50bc2-69a5-11e2-aa86-001a4bcf887a.html

I came here for lunch right after they opened with a friend. The food was OK but I have to admit that the waitress was not especially customer service focused. My friend asked for more sauce for her wings and two things happened: 1)  she charged us more than she said she was going to for the "lunch special wings" and 2) she charged us for the sauce! When we asked about it she just said she must have been wrong about the lunch special. Did nothing to make it right with us! I was surprised.   Also a pet peeve: none of these places that have sports on TV EVER show women's sports on any of the sets. Why is that?

They are new so service needs to improve. We waited for food longer than I expected.
