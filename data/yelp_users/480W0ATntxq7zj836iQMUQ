Absolutely horrible customer service. The only reason I am an Admirals club member is for the expedited customer service when I need to make changes to a flight. Was in earlier today trying to upgrade a my CLT to LHR leg to business and she flat out told me that she wouldn't help me. Not only was she unwilling to help me she was a flat our miserable human being that has no business being in customer service especially from a premium product. I ended up walking down to the other admirals club where they were happy to help.

C.A.S.A. how I have tried to like you. I would say I've been there 30+ times and certainly more than that if you consider it's previous life as Chronic Taco (same owner, same problems). For the purpose of this review I will stick to the outside bar since that is where I have spent of the majority of my time.   I will start out with the one positive that the food here is fairly decent for inexpensive bar food. They have a creative twist on several entrees that make it worth the occasional stop in.   Location-wise the sun makes it difficult to enjoy this place year around and it can be down right blinding during sunset. Location isn't what really kills this place though. It is the lack of any operational savvy by the management team and disengaged owner. I certainly see Scotty there fairly often but he never seems very interested in anyone other then his friends. I often joke when I get dragged here that they will certainly mess up my drink run out of a key ingredient (like soda water) or just in general make a mistake. However, it's not even the mistakes that kill this place for me. It's the horribly rude bartenders and managers. It's so bad it's almost funny. They give me someone else's credit card back and glare at me like it's my fault ? Ok C.A.S.A. . I've tried. I hope you are successful, but I just can't come here anymore.

The food is pretty spot on. Love the ghost pepper burger and the milk shakes are great. However, the delivery is a huge miss. Drivers are complete a** holes. Literally won't get out of their car or speak a word to you. Service is so bad it's laughable.

Owner is very kind and truly loves animals. My travel schedule is very hectic and I often have to leave with very little notice. She is not only accommodating but my dog loves spending time with her. It's a home away from home and has become part of our extended family.
