BAG YOUR OWN GROCERIES!!! These people have the worst foresight with my produce and glass jars. I'm so disappointed in them. I won't let them bag anything anymore

I Love this place its a gem in the desert. The staff are so friendly, funny and kind and helpful, I've been twice now and both times have been great. The person who did my hair was Emily B. shes a magic worker, not that my hair was bad bad but it wasn't cut correctly ( and i gave myself bangs) and she did her thing she knew what she was talking about and now it looks great.  i highly recommend this salon its clean simple elegant and beautiful yeah emily B!!

this place was horrible. five months i had to schedule, in advance  because i couldn't get in in the first month when i purchased my Groupon.. ok well, not, but, ok.. so  i had scheduled the same appt times for every appt. every time i got there they told me i was early or late bec. without telling me they'd change it. thanks...not.  i wasnt able to get all my appts in b4 they realised they had done it incorrectly so i got 4 microderms and no facial, instead of what the Groupon called for what a bummer DO NOT GO here this place SUCKS i love Groupon deals but i feel like we Grouponers get treated as less then   the front desk girls were atrociously snotty and holier then tho kinda shi!, i'd see it everytime i went    i'd sit and wait and wait, no hello are you waiting or have you signed in, or how are you, no, are you ready for a great experience???... nothing just me waiting  patiently  kinda and one other problem other than the bad front desk, no organization and just shitty customer service is i guess,the bathroom (very disappointing!!)  its the only bathroom in the office its near the front door and its like being in a gas station bathroom, i am so disappointed in this business. I WISH I HADN'T PAYED FOR ANYTHING FROM THEM, I FEEL LIKE I WAS ROBBED i dont like what this company does to businesses (yelp) but TDoB, isn't worth your time or effort!!  i drove so far every time to go there to get treated badly by some little girls playing games with my MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have been here 3 times with my bf for a couple beers and pizza, salad & apps. The pizza was so good, we ordered the sausage and onion I asked for garlic to be added Yum Yum. They have Papago brewing beer, the Orange blossom ale omg Yum. I love the atmosphere the bartenders are nice guys the owner is interesting ask him what he used to do, wow. Idk why there are so many bad reviews but I've only ate pizza and beer with some apps and salad

The business is a catering place but they do have the ability to setup a few seats. It's very clean inside and out, which is important for.., well everyone! The food was authentic and delicious. The owner was very cool, even on a hard day like today. I'd definitely go back and probably might have them cater for us. I love good interesting non-boring-American food! Drop what you're doing and go eat there now!!!:) yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
