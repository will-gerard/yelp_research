On a Sunday night in July, we met up with some out of town friends who were staying at a local hotel.  The location was perfect for them - so, I called and made a reservation for our group.  When we first arrived, the bar area was vacant - with the exception of one other table of 2 customers.  Since we had called ahead and let them know that our group would be there at 7, I was hoping for, at least, good service.  Unfortunately, the service was really slow. More than once, someone from our group had to go find our server and request service.  Ugh!  While the conversation from our friends really kept us entertained, it's kind of sad when the server can't seem to remember why she came to work (make money?)  While I didin't personally try one, the consensus was the margaritas were more like tequila shooters with fozen ice thrown in - which is fine if that's what you're ordering.  Would we come back?  Maybe - if we have other friends staying locally.    Would I recommend it?  Not sure.    Plus Side:  Great patio with sand bowling.  Would be a great during the winter months.

If you can endure the parking lot, you will enjoy eating at this Pita Jungle location. If you're flexible (at all), stay away from the traditional lunch time (12-2) as parking is a bear!   Now - the food. Really good food with good prices. Chicken schwarma is awesome and the red bell pepper hummus is too! I call it a "carnival of flavor" ... I'm not sure it was really that good or if I was really that hungry - but everything tasted incredible ;)   Nice outside patio seating next to the lake comes complete with free entertainment - ducks.   Family friendly place that's also good for a quick lunch with a friend/co-worker or two. Commissioned art pieces decorate the place - so if you're an aspiring artist - this might be a good place for you, as well.   Would I return? Absolutely!

This is my favorite Starbucks!    Yeah, I know you're thinking that they're all the same - but, really are they?  Haven't you ever gone to another location of your fav place and it's just not the same?    My drink always tastes the same (the right way), the people are awesome, it's always clean, wifi works, and even the other patrons are nice.    Like everyone else in Arizona, I spend a lot of time in my car - - so I visit a lot of Starbucks; But this one - this one is different.  Different = Better.  No complaints here.

Liberty Market is a great place ... great staff, great service, great food.  I've been there a few times with just one other person and with a large group (#evfn) and the folks at Liberty Market have always exceeded my expectations.  Kudos!

It's been a few months since my first review, so I thought I'd drop a quick line and let you know that Liberty Market is a good place.  The owners are awesome and caring - and the staff (called "the brigade") and really nice, too.  Food portions are beyond generous.  Prices as low as $1.66 for an espresso or you can get a full sized, All American breakfast for $8.00.     The environment is welcoming and great for groups. No stress or worries about being rushed out.    Just an overall really nice "third place"

History. That's what makes this roller rink unlike any other.  From the staff to the locals, this place was hopin' on Friday night.    The rink itself was very clean - looks like they take pride is keeping it that way too!  Choice of "regular" rental skates or roller blades - both of which seem to be maintained.  The snack bar attendant was nice and helpful, as well.    Food was what we expected - pizza, pretzels, sodas and Icees.    Kiddos had a great time, which makes me very happy.   Would we go back? Yep - probably will.  See you there? Hope so!

After an afternoon of hiking, we stopped by Filly's for a quick bite.  They're parking lot is always full, so we thought it would be worth investigating.  We were right!  The day's special was pulled pork sandwich for less than the cost of a burger.  Both of us got the sandwich, one with sweet potato fries and one with regular fries.  Paid for an extra salad and a couple of drinks.  Although it was a mid week afternoon, the place was busy.  The waitress (who was all by herself) did a fabulous job!  Taking care of customers inside the dining room and outside on the patio ... major kudos for taking such good care of us.  We will be back.  You should give it a try too.

For some reason, I like this store. We've been shopping here for years for various sports needs and really have never let me down.   We've purchased probably a dozen or more pairs of shoes for the kiddos over the years. Good shoes, trendy styles, name brands and good prices.   We've purchased a decade's worth of baseball equipment from here, as well.   One of the things I have learned about this store, is never buy anything that's not on sale (unless you absolutely must have it right then and there). If you're patient, the items will probably available at a lower prices within a few weeks.   Even during "off seasons" we've been able to pick up some good quality equipment at a respectable discount.   The folks who work here are definitely not overly enthusiastic to help, but if you ask a question, you will get a polite answer. Which in my book, is good enough.   Will we shop here again? Absolutely!  Recommend you shop here? Absolutely!

Our group was there on Thursday...about 10 of us.  We shared a variety of all of the appetizer specials ... everything was delicious. They should probably have warned us about the habanero sauce that came with one of the dishes (sorry, can't remember which one)... but after the initial burn, it was really good.  (If you like really hot & spicy, the habanero burger is awesome!).  Our waitress was excellent!  While we weren't a very demanding group, our server was on-the-ball and very professional.    The decor is very unique, as well...in keeping with the "tavern' theme - there are bat-like designs everywhere.  If you visit during the cooler months, sit outside on the patio near the water or be sure to come at night and hang out next to the fireplace.  Fair warning, parking can be a bit of a bear as it is very limited.   Overall, it's a nice place and good food.

Met a group of friends for lunch at this particular NYPD location.  I've been to their Chandler restaurant a few times, but now that I've visited this one - gotta admit - I kinda like this one better.  Staff was very friendly and professional. Prices are always good.  They have a kids eat free night (Wednesday?) which impressed me, as well as a nice kids menu.  Restaurant was clean, bathrooms were clean and overall, it's a nice place.

After watching the Subway episode of Undercover Boss, I kind of expected a different experience.  Took my kiddos there for a later-than-normal dinner (almost 9pm).  We were the only ones in the place and had to wait for the employee to finish eating before ordering.  Not only did they (yes, there were 2 employees) not greet us, but they chatted amongst themselves with their backs to us.  When they finally got around to us, I asked for a 6" tuna on flatbread.  They were out of flatbread.  Since I don't like their bread to begin with, I went without.    My kiddos ordered a 6" meatball and a 6" BLT.  Not hard orders to make and thankfully they were correct.  Two combo meals (6" sub with a drink & chips) and our bill was just a tad over $10.   While this is definitely not my favorite Subway, the plus side is - they're next door to Starbucks (which does have a drive-thru).

The family and I headed out to the fair on a Tuesday night in November.  This is not the home grown state fair you remember growing up.  While they may try to make it seem that way, this one is a corporate venture for sure.  Thankfully, we went early enough that there really weren't alot of people and the kiddos could get their ride and games in before dark.  Parking at the Fair grounds cost us $10 - which we gladly paid to not have to walk down McDowell after dark.  We had free tickets to get in, so that saved us $40+.  Typical foods available - fried twinkies, mondo fries, Chinese food, pizza ... even scorpions.  No - we didn't try them, but hear they taste just like chicken :)  We actually picked this particular night to go so we could see David Cook in concert.    Here's the great part of the Fair ... general seating is FREE with fair admission.  Sure - you can buy a reserved seat (for something like $15 - $20) to sit a little closer, but we chose the free seats.  GREAT concert!  The opening band, The Script, were from Dublin, Ireland and did a good job.  This was their first opening for David Cook (and in America?) and their energy really showed their excitement.  David Cook was awesome!  The best part - he sounded pretty much just like he does on his CD. He was joking around with the audience and having a great time performing.  Really enjoyed his singing and the overall performance.  I hope he has a really long career ahead of him.   If you're planning a trip to the fair and would like to save some $$$, definitely read the other YELP reviews before going.  There's at least one or two for cheapskates that don't want to spend alot.    Will we go back to the Fair? probably. Will we go back for the concert series?  Absolutely!  Suggestions? 1) Check out their website for discount days. 2) Unless you want to, don't pay full price (see above) 3) Set a budget and stick to it.   4) Check out the concert series. 5) Allow plenty of time to have fun. 6) There is a free shuttle from somewhere to the fairgrounds ... it would be worth it to research this a little more & find out from where. I didn't have time or we probably would have done this too :) 7) If you're on twitter - so are they. twitter.com/azstatefair 8) Their website is www.azstatefair.com  Have a good time!

Love this place! I love the ambiance, atmosphere, the people and the menu!    Designed as a "nicer" restaurant, but with all of the amenities of "home away from home". We went on a Thursday afternoon along with a couple of business-attired folks sitting at the bar working at their lap tops, several booths with 4-5 people and a couple of families.  The server brought chips & salsa to the table and then we enjoyed the taco salad and tortilla soup (very, very good!) and the three combo plate.    Both meals were very good, worth the price (total bill was $20 + tip), but what made this adventure enjoyable was our server.  She was very personable, professional and really delightful.  We asked if she was the owner and she replied "no", but just really loved her job!  WOW - don't hear that every day.  The Owner did visit our table and chat with us a bit ... which was very nice.  I'm all about good customer service and this place definitely did not disappoint.  Looks like they even have a (big) room in the back for meetings or networking events.   Definitely worth checking out.

This visit to The Urban Tea Loft was organized by a friend for our weekly "East Valley Friday Night" gathering. Unlike the others in our group, I am a tea fan.  I appreciate all varieties of tea - hot & cold.  While I think there were only a handful of us in the group that actually drank "tea", I'm pretty sure everyone had a great time.  The owner & staff were very nice & professional, the food was very good & reasonably priced and the guitar playing gentleman was cool.    Would I recommend The Urban Tea Loft? Absolutely!  Great place for a group get-together or to go by yourself to read a good book.  Enjoy!

Hmmmm...I started out reading other reviews of this place and I'm thinking that maybe a 2nd visit is in order.  Our experience was definitely not like others.  We stopped by here for lunch.  $5 lunch special includes your entree, 2 scoops of rice, veggies and a small drink.  We both got the BBQ chicken ... the boneless chicken portion was small, the rice was good and  the veggies consisted of cabbage (and that's it!).  We were greeted by a woman on the phone who hung up only long enough to take our order and then returned to the phone.  Since we were the only ones in the place (at 12pm!!), I wondered if her conversation was meant to be entertainment?  Considering this place is next door to several other really good restaurants, I can't help but wonder why anyone would choose this particular establishment instead of one of the others?  Ample free parking, cause it's a shopping center.  Would we return? I don't know.  Would I recommend?  I just don't know.  If we decide to give this place a second chance, I'll update my review.

Great location, easy to find, parking is a bit lacking - but what you'll find inside this restaurant is worth it.   Attended a networking event at Sign of the Whale and found the staff to be professional, prices affordable and just a really nice atmosphere.    They serve seafood and great drinks.  Our bartender, Steve (?), did a fabulous job - which was no small feat considering I don't think the restaurant was actually expecting dozens of people to descend upon them.  Bruce, the owner, is very nice and LOVES his restaurant.  It's always nice to meet people who are passionate about what they do.  This is a nice, home town restaurant.

I LOVE this place!  A group of us meet here occasionally for lunch.  Yeah - it's a grocery store, but they also have a nice little restaurant that serves up a delicious lunch.  Lots to choose from - like taco salad to fajitas (and everything in between).  Want to sample something? No problem. Just ask.  Drinks are in a bottle and the salsa bar is across the seating area.   Order a combo and you'll be pleasantly content when it's gone.    The grocery store also offers very fresh food and good prices.  Home made tortillas are a very nice addition - not just corn and flour, but also flavored (hot & spicy too).  The variety of salsas is also a pleasant surprise.   Don't be afraid to give it a try.  It's very clean and well taken care of.  We have always found both the patrons and the people who work here to be very kind and helpful.    We'll definitely be back.

We bought one of those discount coupons for this restaurant, so a Friday afternoon lunch seemed the perfect time to try it out.  It's been ages since I've been here.  We arrived a few minutes after 11am (when they open) and along with one other table - we were the only ones in the place. Great service!  We ordered a dish with a lot of melted cheese (their specialty?) and I ordered the veggie fajitas.  Both were good.    Because of the coupon, we needed to purchase a minimum in food and beverage, so we also ordered two desserts.  The flan was o.k. and the sopapillas were awesome!  Would we recommend?  Absolutely.    Try to order from the lunch menu - seems like its a good deal for the price.  Drinks are unlimited too.
