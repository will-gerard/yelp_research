Stick to the Nigiri & most Sushi... All the other items special or Tepanyaki are too pricy.  Benihana is gonna be better cost & put on a show if your I to that kinda stuff.  For a simple bite to eat - nothing more.

Cheers - !!!!!!!!!! great pies here !!!!!!!!!!!!  The Pizzas- absolutely Super tasty, fresh ingredients, robust flavors, the sauce was just right!  Great pizza will be ordering again this is a Adult pizza... Not so much for the kiddos  Best Veggie Pizza any of us had in recollection... It was gone so fast!  The Pepperoni & Sausage - I loved it.  Not kiddo safe ... the cheese was under the pepperoni and the toppings fell off for the kids. 'Eh what-ya gonna do huh?!'  Price is higher but worthy of a quality Pie!  Cheers - KSoderberg
