Can't think of a better way to spend a few hours in the desert.  Took advantage of the Groupon deal to get four of us in for $44, then upgraded to an annual membership for two for just $2 more.  Beat that!  This really is a case of "a picture is worth a thousand words".  Look at the photo gallery and go!

Yeah, it's borderline ghetto, but the authentic Mexican food makes it well worth venturing outside your comfort zone! All fresh & delicious!!!   Definitely more of a lunch, than dinner, spot.  Carolina's is far from upscale. Think cafeteria style with styrofoam boxes & plastic ware. No cerveza or tequila here, either, but at these prices you can drink later!

Well, the service was poor & the food was mediocre, at best. Even the chips & salsa were blah, once I finally got them (after the entree arrived & I asked for them).    Garcia's might be worthy of 3-4 stars in the Midwest, but this is Arizona.  You can do soooo much better!

Bagels just don't get any better than this!  Huge, fresh & flavorful... pretty much everything you could ask for in a bagel.    When you start with a bagel this good, you can rest assured that your bagel sandwich will be awesome, as well.    Great coffee drinks, juices and pasties, too!  I'd like a little more in terms of ambiance, but this is Mesa, so I'll settle for the typical east-valley suburban strip-mall setting with friendly service...  & amazing bagels.

Sir Elton was simply amazing, from his opening number to show-stopping close!  Two solid hours of everything you could possibly hope for as an Elton John fan, in a show perfectly produced for the Colleseum, complete with a stunning video backdrop.  I've seen Elton five or six times over the past twenty years, and I can honestly say that this was one of the best.  His voice is as crisp as ever and he took time in this show to explain the stories behind some of his hits.    He performed a total of nineteen songs, opening with "The Bitch is Back" and closing with, "The Circle of Life", with pretty much all of your favorites in between.    Not only is Elton incredible, but he's accompanied by some of the best in the business, including Ray Cooper on percussion!  If you get a chance to catch MDP, don't miss it!

Delicious frozen yogurt in dozens of predictable & unique favors, with a plethora of amazing toppings, including fresh fruit, nuts, candy, sauces & whipped cream. Unlimited free samples. Spotlessly clean & modem store. Friendly service.  Ample seating inside & out, on the shaded rear patio.  Fair prices. What else could you possibly need in a frozen yogurt establishment?   Salted caramel, topped with Heath bits & caramel syrup? Yes, please! Pretty much the perfect way to wrap up a hot summer day in Phoenix.

Breakfast, as good as it gets! The food, YUM!  The service, outstanding! The vibe, hipster chill. The wait at 8:45 on a Sunday morning, 5-10 minutes. Phew, I would have happily waited 30 minutes.  Matt, I applaud you for taking the time to prepare everything from scratch with only the finest ingredients.  It shows in the homemade belgian waffles with sweet creamery butter & real maple syrup, the thick sliced peppery & oh so perfect bacon, the omelets made with Wisconsin cheddar, the rosemary home fries, the breakfast sandwich, the fresh-squeezed OJ and, of course, the bottomless cup of locally roasted dark roast coffee.    I can only imagine how good their biscuits & sausage gravy would be... if they had them, but I love a restaurant that does a few things very well, instead of trying to be all things to all people.

The best breakfast, ever?  No, but worthy of a solid four-star review for the following reasons; excellent, friendly & fast service on a busy Sunday morning for a party of eight, which included two three year-olds (thanks Krista), relaxing inside or comfortable patio seating (outside for us on this unseasonably cool late May morning), fair prices, breakfast/brunch cocktail menu (not typical outside New Orleans), unique breakfast/brunch menu options with a southwest flare (Sonoran crepes for me) and gluten-free offerings, just in case.  Oh, the Yelp 20% discount with "check-in", doesn't hurt either!  Had the biscuits and gravy (just so-so) been as good as the crepes, breakfast chimi, gluten-free waffle or eggs Benedict, I would have been obligated to award the coveted full five-stars.    Bottom-line, SBL is a great breakfast/brunch option in the far East Valley!
