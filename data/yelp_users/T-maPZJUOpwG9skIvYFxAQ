I have stayed at this property a couple times and have never had a problem.  I won't give it a 5 star, only because of the surrounding area (can be a little rough).  The rooms are large, the staff members are pleasant and the breakfast is actually good.  Plenty of free parking, which can be an issue in this area.  If you are going to this area, stay here - you will enjoy it.

This was the first time we had eaten at this restaurant, and have to say - we are SO glad we did.  There were 3 of us, and I got my usual dish I get at most mexican restaurants, enchiladas.  I had 1 shredded beef, and 1 shredded chicken - and they had probably the best flavor I have had since being in Puerto Vallarta.  The service was great, and the atmosphere is amazing.

I have stayed at this hotel twice, and have to say, not the best in the area.  The rooms are clean, but the service is just not there.  And if you want parking, best plan on parking at the hotel behind it and walk in the dark to the hotel.  It is not your typical full service Holiday Inn, it has more of a Days Inn feeling.  I tried calling the front desk one day while on the road, and no one would answer, so I had to turn around and drive 5 miles back to the hotel just to ask them a simple question.  There are plenty of hotels in the area, you might be better off staying elsewhere, such as the Hampton Inn or Hilton.  I am even a platinum member for Priority Club, and I would rather go elsewhere.

I visited Phoenix after many years being gone (I lived there 95 to 01) , and went to this club with a friend.  It happened to be Thursday, which is $1 drinks all day & night - what could be better?!?!?  The patio is fabulous, and now has a food truck with great food.  You have got to go to the unisex bathroom - it is unlike any bathroom in a club - it was really cool!  This is my hangout now while in Phoenix.
