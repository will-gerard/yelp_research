Love this place. They have something for everyone and the staff is great. I recently went vegan and they have vegetarian options that are easily made vegan. The staff was awesome about making sure nothing went on my sub that wasnt supposed to. They have fast service and a great atmosphere if you feel like dinning in. I have never had a bad experience here.

Love this place! Great food and even better service. My mom will drive from peoria just to eat here with me. All their dishes are customizable.

I liked it the first trip. Got a thai tea and was happy with the service. Second trip ruined it all. Poor service. Horrible coffee. I wrote a review on their facebook they they promptly deleted.

I come here every 3 months to see keely their hygienist. She is the only reason I continue coming here. Plus shes the only consistent person I've noticed. Every time Ive seen a dentist I've been told the previous one no longer works there. Keely is great about planning out my cleanings based on what I can afford but their dentist always try to pressure me to spend thousands of dollars right then and there on painful procedures that I would like to plan in advance for. Their office staff changes often as well but I have noticed the new girls are much more friendly and attentive.

Got a dozen for my coworkers and it was a hit. So good and almost all the donuts are vegan!
