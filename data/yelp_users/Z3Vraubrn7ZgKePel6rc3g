The crispy duck was aweful dry and all bones chopped up with little meat. The plum sauce was not helping. And the server argued with me that the crabmeat in the crab sauce was real when it was actually overpriced disgusting canned corn chowder with imitation crab. I should of listened to my fiance when he said this place was horrible. Yuck never again.

I've give her if I had the option the people who work here are beyond rude and lazy and had all of their product off the line 20 minutes before close and refuse to make anything saying it was too close to closing. I work in the restaurant industry and if we have the unpleasant surprise of somebody walking in even three minutes before close and want to order 5 of the hardest dishes to make off the menu you better believe our cooks as sad and upset to know that they will be there another hour even longer, still make those dishes.

These guys do a great job. I've looked everywhere for a drive thru wash with soft pads so it doesn't scratch my paint..drive thrus r harsh on black..and not only does this place have it but the guys come out and give ur car a pre hand scrubbed wash down..legit..$5-7 can't beat it. Both me and my fiance come here..both black sports cars and never worry about scratches. :)

My fiance n I love coming here to get away and have amazing Japanese/ Korean dishes. The sushi is super fresh and the hot dishes never disappoint! One thing I really like is being greeted by the sweetest owner you'll ever meet! He's always all smiles and prepares all your sushi carefully, really showing how much he loves the art that it is. He's also been making a lot of great new renovations that's worth checking out!!

Amazing!! And my daughter LOVES the staff.  We got back right away and I was definitely allowed back there with her during her X-Rays and cleaning. (unlike what the unhappy yelper commented below.)  My daughters tiny mouth wasn't allowing her adult teeth to grow in properly and we knew she was going to need to have them removed.  My daughter was scared and very nervous, but the girls in the front, and her dentist talked to her about the procedure and what to except from her point of view. My daughter came up to me and said, "Mom if they have to pull my teeth out. I'm not afraid anymore"  It just about put the girls in the front  and myself in tears.. It was soo cute.  Dr. Mathews even asked if we would like to do it same day!! This doesn't happen..Anywhere. I usually have to wait up to 2 months to schedule producers. ( And he told me this was a rare instance because a similar procedure had called and moved their date).. They did take my daughter back without me, but No dentist office lets the parents go back if any kind of sedation is involved. Even laughing gas where they are fully awake. (what my daughter had) I'd like to know what dentist that woman found who does let them back, because I'm pretty sure it's a liability issue.  Parents aren't allowed to be in a surgical room if the doctor is doing a sedated procedure, right.) Anyways.  The whole staff was amazing!! I'm switching my son over as soon as the New Year comes!  I took my kids to a very popular dentist office before this one, and had my fair share of horrible experiences.  Never going back.. Everyone here really cares and it shows. Thank You Dr. Mathews and Dr. Brenke and You're AMAZING staff!! We'll see you in 6 months!!

They always doing an amazing job trisha does the best pink and whites ever. They last and last and last and never chip or lift. Been going to her 4 years and years now and won't go anywhere else all the girls there are always smiling and so sweet to my kids. My kids don't even whine when they know I have to go and get my nails done because the girls make them feel right at home. I recommend this place to every girl I ever meet that talks about how awful their nail places R around here. I would give more stars if I could

So much cool stuff in a tucked away place!  So many awesome looking fish and even sharks! I  came in over the weekend looking for koi for my pond, and left with some of the prettiest goldfish and koi. The owner was very nice and helpful. She gave me great tips for my pond expansion and even took my info down and said she would special order plants for me as well!!  I thought this was really neat since i usually had to drive all the way out to gilbert just to buy fish food.  Even though I'm not a reptile person, i thought her collection was really neat as well.   I'll def be back!..Soon! Thanks Laura for all your help! :)

Very upset just left. Had recommended by a friend and given a gift certificate to try so we made this date night. Our server never gave us her name. Now we now why. Heavier set Indian girl. We ordered crisp  spring roll with chicken. It should of been cold. It was long time and room temp. She never asked how it was. She stayed in the back the whole time. We asked multiple ?s about our food b4 ordering her answers were basic and she left out so big key points like the mignon was medallions so very rare would be very impossible not 40 mins to make in a kitchen.  She never did any check back on our meal. She pretty much made our experience suck to the point of leaving. Eating nothing. The last straw was asking for Brown rice. I asked but she forgot. And she used it as an opportunity to disappear again into the kitchen for another 5 min to make us think it must need to be a prepared iteam. Like spaghetti in an Italian restaurant. Since my fiance n I have been in the industry for over 15 yrs we'd had enough. 1st I ever left 10% and I know the tip gods understand. I left her a receipt tip as well about her customer service skills. Oh 1 star because the steak was aweful and my salad was covered in minced galic. It wasn't edible. We won't be back. So sad.

Really enjoyed the food. Big portions and happy kids. Even had homemade jewelry for sale so the girls loved getting new necklaces and son loves his dream catcher.
