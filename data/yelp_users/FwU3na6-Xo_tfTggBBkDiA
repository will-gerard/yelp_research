If you're looking for pure luxury, don't go here.  If you're looking for a perfectly priced room with a nice bathroom, kitchenette, and comfy bed - this is the place.  The grounds are well maintained, the pools were sparkling clean and on more than one occasion the night we stayed there, we saw security patroling the grounds.  It's conveniently located near shops, restaurants and so on.  We didn't check out the free breakfast this time.  This is definitely where we'll be staying when we have to go to Scottsdale again!

Short, simple and to the point: friendly service at the front desk, nice clean room, working TV (a must) and close to everywhere we needed to go. The rates were good as well. Can't beat that!

Our savior from our bad experience at another hotel.  The room was clean and very comfortable. The layout is great with a small fridge, microwave and desk by the sitting area. The bed was beyond comfy as well.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was tasty, even tho the coffee leaves a little be desired!! Both the room coffee and the breakfast coffee was a bit weak but, with that being the only con to our stay, that's ok. There's a Starbucks nearby to make up for it.  We'll definitely be back!!

I read some of the reviews and it looks like service is still a huge problem. Hubby and I stopped in to watch the NCAA Final 4 game while having dinner. We found a table and waited a few minutes until someone came by to get our drink order. We're non-drinkers and when we asked for tea, our waitress gave us THAT look that we're used to seeing. I wanted to tell her to not judge us because we don't drink. We're good tippers (having spent a combined 20+ years in the restaurant biz). I knew immediately we were going to be in for a bad evening and I was right.  She brought our drinks, took our order and we didn't see her again until we were finished eating. We could have used some ketchup, mustard and a little more salad dressing...along with more iced tea but why bother, right?  I sat facing the whole bar and watched while one of the waitresses busted her butt for 6 large tables in one section as well as a couple of other tables near where we were sitting. Our waitress, on the other hand, hung out by the service area at the bar with no other tables under her watch. I have NO idea why she took us when she was serving the bar on the other side of the restaurant.  Suffice to say the meal was meh. We left before the game was over because the waitress put our check down and said, " Need anything else?" as she put the bill down and walked away.   Sad stuff because I know we could have gone elsewhere and had fantastic service. I wish we had. We won't be back when we're back in Scottsdale. We probably would have had better service at a fast food joint.

We hit the mall in search of dinner on 9/30, figuring we'd find something cool and casual. We actually hit the jackpot.  The food was pretty good but what blew us away (and earned the 5 stars) was the service. Our waitress was Karyl and she was awesome. She said she'd only been there about a week but it sure didn't seem like it. She was great, very personable and attentive.   If we're ever back in Tempe (and we're there a few times a year), we'll definitely be back...hopefully when she's working.

I've been interested in staying at an Aloft hotel ever since one opened in my town of Tucson. When the opportunity arrived to spend a couple of nights in Tempe, I decided to go for it and see what it was all about. I'm sorry we did.  The room was dusty, walls had repair patches, the carpet in the hallways was lumpy from all of the rolling carts and luggage, the elevators are scary to ride in (not smooth at all), cobwebs on the pool fence and speakers, cigarette butts all over the patio, full trashcans outside...you get the idea.  The worst of it was the bed. Neither of us got a good night's sleep with the mattress 'pad' coming up and getting lumpy, the pillows were horrible as well. We had planned on staying 2 nights but checked out after the first night. There was no way we could stay there anymore.  Thankfully, we had a nice chat with the manager who listened to our complaints and took notes about housekeeping. I hope they make some changes. It could be a cool place to stay.  PS: The platform that the bed is on is a shin breaker. There needs to be some kind of padding on the corners. I've got a nice bruise from the first time I smacked my leg.

While searching for something new and different during our stay in Chandler, we were walking around Mill Avenue. The better half suggested trying Mellow Mushroom - fantastic choice.   It was pretty busy but we were able to grab a table on the patio to people watch while waiting for our Mighty Meaty pizza.  It was amazing. I've always said that, when you have bacon on a pizza, crumbles just won't do. We had honest to goodness chucks o' bacon as well as sausage, pepperoni, ground beef and ham. I was in heaven and wished I had a bigger stomach.  The crust was interesting, too. I loved it.  When we were stuffed, we decided to take a little dessert back to the hotel with us - honey cinnamon pretzels. They are probably much better if you eat them right out of the oven but even after a quick trip in the hotel micro, they weren't too bad!  Since we aren't drinkers, I can't comment on the bar/drinks situation but the set up was quite impressive with a ton of taps.  They'd be a cool addition to Tucson - maybe in Main Gate Square or close by.   Great service Great food  We'll be back!

What a cool spot! We weren't looking for a big/heavy dinner and this place was spot on! We went on the recommendation of a friend - perfect spot!  Jessie took great care of us, didn't flinch when we asked about mocktails/non alcoholic drinks. When a party at the bar was standing a little too close to our table (nothing quite like turning your head and looking at someone's butt less than a foot away), he asked if I was uncomfortable and then asked the offending party to move.   We ordered 3 appetizers - nachos, quesadillas and shrimp/calamari - all were delicious!   The staff was on it from the minute we walked in and we were well taken care of. I don't know if we'd go during the hot summer but, for a beautiful spring evening, it was perfect!
