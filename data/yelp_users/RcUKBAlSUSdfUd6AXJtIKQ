Sonja Duckstein is the epitome of a client first mentality.  Her work ethic is unmatched and her knowledge of the law including our rights as citizens is top notch. I trust to refer my family, friends and clients to Sonja's law firm because I know they will be served with honesty and fairness.

I am a big fan of this boutique restaurant tucked away in the camelback corridor. The food is very good, presentation is beautiful and the staff is near perfect in their attention and care.

I have used empire today several times over the years and each time they meet my high expectations. There was a mistake made on one of those occasions and it was fixed within 12 hours and at no additional cost to me. As a business owner I understand that mistakes are made and the most important thing is that when they are made, the company needs to take responsibility and fix it in as little time as possible at no additional cost to the client. Empire does this very well and I praise them for it. My rep at Empire is Joe Schwab and I highly recommend him for all your flooring needs.

Nancy is a magician. She finds every little thing that is causing the larger pains in your body. While most massage therapists focus on the area you tell them that hurts, Nancy finds the source of the issue and fixes the problem. I am now a lifer for her services and I highly recommend her for anyone looking for a great massage therapist.

This is the 6th time I've been here and unfortunately it wasn't good this time around. The previous 5 I would rate between 3.5 and 4. This one unfortunately is a 2. Beer was good as always. Food, not so much. Crab won tons were very good, grilled cheese was soggy and had spaghettio sauce which they called tomato marmalade lol. Pretzel was ok, beer cheese was good. Calamari was a 1 out of 5 and the ahi was low grade at best. Since I haven't given them a review before you can consider the place a 3. I'll check in next time and hopefully it will be positive. Atmosphere is very good consistently and servers are polite.

I've been here 4 times now and had 6 different items on the menu so I figured its time for a review on Yelp. Everything I've had is delicious, smokey, papa k, andouille, pork belly, dulce de leche scone, and a coffee sweet crepe. My favorite is the andouille, sooooo much flavor and it compliments the delicious coffee perfectly. The coffee is Heart coffee from Oregon and it's my new favorite. I was told Heart coffee is liked by beer drinkers because of its unique taste. Drink it black the first time you have it and if you prefer cream and/or sugar after trying it straight then go for it.  Finally, the ambiance is upbeat and energizing with a perfect mix of music, mostly oldies and classic rock. Hands down my favorite breakfast joint in AZ. Well done to the staff and owners!

Not impressed by anything at this place unfortunately. The decor is decent, everything else is average or below average including the food and service. Everyone is very nice, just not the best servers around. I will not be visiting this place again unless I hear from a trusted source that everything has changed.
