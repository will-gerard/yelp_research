It has taken me a while to find the right hair stylist that I can trust and when I found Jesse at the Steven Paul Salon I knew it was the begining of a beautiful hairstylist/client relationship! Jesse is amazing! She has great style and understsands what her clients are looking for and makes sure that she is on the same page as them before she starts. She is friendly and easy to be around. The salon itself is really fun...there is a cute little boutique in the front as well as a cafe that serves some great iced coffee! Jesse's prices are similar to other hair salons (highlights starting around  $65, cuts around $40-$45) but if you follow her on facebook she often has daily and weekly specials for you to take advantage of. If you are looking for a hair stylist...give Jesse a try! You will walk out loving the new you!

I have been to LOTS of nail places in my time and most of them provide the overall same service experience, not bad but not good. I have lived in Anthem for 2 years now and I found Fendi Nails after trying out the other nail places in the area and not being overly excited about them I stopped into Fendi nails as my last resort before making the hike back to the nail places I normally went to in Scottsdale. I am so glad I did stop in because I love this nail salon! Every nail tech does a great job, does not rush through your service and is personable. They are friendly and often remember you and the things you talked about the last time and ask about it the next time they see you. In addition, the owner does a fantastic job with eyebrow waxing. I came to her when I was trying to fix the mess another waxer did on my eyebrows and she is the only one I have let touch my eyebrows since. Pedicures and manicures are average price...$23 for a pedicure and $12 for a manicure. Next time you are driving through Anthem, stop in!

Last weekend my boyfriend surprised me with a date to the opera to see the adaptation of William Shakesphere's Othello called Otello. The opera was being performed at Symphony Hall in downtown Phoenix. It is one of the few performing arts locations I had not been too and I have nothing bad to say about it. The sound was great and the seats were comfortable. It is very nice inside with different paintings, sculptures, etc on display. Parking in downtown Phoenix can be tough and pricey, but we were able to get there early to grab a drink at a local bar and found metered parking..and since it was a Saturday evening we didn't have to pay the meter...SCORE!  I would go back to see other performances here!

I LOVE sushi...and if I could eat this for every meal, I would! I usually go to the same places...but I decided to try some place new. Since I have heard great things about this place and I am in the area everyday, I decided to try Kabuki one day for lunch at the Tempe Marketpalce. I had been to their other location in Glendale before, and it was horrible service and their rolls fell apart with one touch. I give second chances though. So I ordered a couple different speciality roles that I have never had before at other sushi resturants. When my rolls came, I experienced the same thing I did at the other location...every roll I picked up fell apart! You can't eat sushi rolls when they fall apart as you try and put it in your mouth. Your plate is left with all the droppings and it really just takes the fun out of eating it. The service was ok, nothing special. They do have a rewards club called the Red Mask club where you earn points for every dollar you spent. I happened to go during a double point time so I earned more points for dining that day....but I highly doubt I will be back anytime soon to see the benefits of these points. I will stick with what I know until something else comes up!

There is something about the Carefree/Cave Creek area that I am just drawn to. It has a true Arizona feel and brings in a lot of tourists but also has some great bars and resturants. Last weekend my boyfriend stumbled upon a burger joint called Big Earl's Greasy Eats.  We went back for lunch and this girl who isn't the burger type was pleasantly surprised. The menu had a variety of different burgers, sandwiches and salads that you could choose from. They also have sweet potatoe fries which are my favorite! I ordered the sweet potatoe fries and a mushroom and swiss burger and my boyfriend order a classic cheeseburger and regular fries. We heard that their milkshakes were amazing so we got a Strawberry shake to share. You order inside but all the seating is outside so we found a spot outside. It was great for people watching and the weather was amazing so it was nice to sit outside. The food came within 10 minutes and I was pleasantly surprised that the burgers were not as greasy as I thought they would be given the name of the resturant! I am not a big burger fan but I ate the whole thing..it was delicious! The sweet potatoe fries were a great treat as well! The milkshake was good, but I personally didn't see what the big fuss was about them as it didn't taste like something I hadn't had before. We finished our beers (oh yah, they have a wide selection of bottle beers there as well!) and left happy. The price was great as well...for 2 burgers, 2 order of fries, a milkshake and 2 beers we spent about $26...not bad at all! I would definately come back to this place and recommend it to others!

Horrible customer service and so hard to find anything!! No one helped me and my boyfriends daughter and I was even sitting on the floor going through a stack of shorts that were not sized and had several styles mixed in trying to find her size. There were bins of clothes in the already too small walk ways of the store and no one acknowledged us for about 20 minutes. Towards the end, as associate who seemed to have just clocked on came by to help us and suggested a couple things, but at that point the damage was done and I was over it.  I won't be heading back into a Justice anytime soon, time to find my boyfriend's 10 year old daugher a new place to shop!
