Found this place on Yelp after our soccer game was canceled decided to try it out for lunch. Wings were awesome! Cooked all the way with lots of sauce and great flavor. I had the chicken Philly and it was delicious! I recommend this to anyone looking for good food at great prices. Locals were friendly :)

Took my two teenage boys to get their hair cut for the first time at Innerlocks. Lynette Skinner did a great job cutting both their hair. One wanted to look like Tom Cruise in Top Gun and the other didn't want his hair cut at all  she was able to make both the boys and this momma happy.  Now they will be presentable for Easter. We will definitely be going back.

I have gone here a few times over the past years for eyebrow waxing, facials and massages. Today I did the Stress Knot package and a basic facial. Donna did my massage and I can tell you honestly it was the BEST message of my life!  The pressure was perfect, no pain no gain and she really paid attention to my muscles working the knotted areas.  I will definitely make sure I book with her the next time I go. My facial was with Laura and she also did a great job, it was very relaxing and my skin looked and felt great when I left.

It was a little on the warm side in the restaurant but it is 117 out in august. The service was fantastic, we had drinks at the bar while we waited to be seated. The bartender was very friendly. I had the fajita chimichanga and my husband had the El Rico with steak. Both items were flavorful and well prepared. The El Rico is spicy so beware.

Just Polished Nails by Ashley is at Bloom Salon. She is a true nail artist. I can show her anything on Pintrest and she can recreate it!! The salon itself is beautiful and has a great atmosphere. The girls up front are always pleasant and helpful. I recommend Bloom to everyone but if you are looking for nails ask for Ashley!

Went to Tropical Smoothie and can honestly say I won't ever be back. I was the only customer there and 5 employees working. One took my order while the other watched. The remaining three were in the back. I think it was shift a shift change as one was counting out her drawer. The two at the front continued to talk, flirt and goof around. I thought maybe I needed to go make my smoothie myself. Another customer walked in and ordered a smoothie and I thought ok, surely they will start making my drink now. NOPE!!! A third customer walked in and it wasn't until they took his order that the manager asked the girl at the front to start blending and took the boy to the back to count his drawer. My sons smoothie was fine but mine was powdery. I think they like smoking pot a little too much in that joint.

Ordered buffalo chicken salad to go. Paid $13 and change with tip. Got back to the office and the lettuce was brown, chicken was boneless wings thrown on top instead of a chicken breast cut up. They were soggy and less than warm. I get this salad all the time at the Arrowhead location and it is so good I crave it!! Totally disappointed and based on other reviews I don't think I will be eating at this location again. I gave two stars because the staff was friendly enough and I didn't have to wait to get my food.

This is a great place for a massage. Much better than the big chain. Office staff was friendly. Therapist did a great job listening to my needs and checked to make sure I was comfortable. I can't wait to go back. I might even sign up for their wellness plan if the second massage is just as great as the first.

Love VCC my husband and I live in Verrado and ride our bikes every weekend to Verrado Coffee Company! Eric, Hayden, Chris and all the employees are extremely nice. Love the food, the breakfast burrito, ham & egg croissant are my two favorites. My kids love the smoothies and giant cinnamon rolls. The atmosphere is cozy if you want to hang out and read a book or play checkers with a friend. So glad they opened this place!!!

We arrived early on a Sunday in an attempt to beat the dinner crowd but 4:30 PM was not early enough.  We had a party of 12 so we knew it would be a while, our wait was about an hour which was under the time they quoted us.   The service was outstanding.  Everyone from the hostess, to the table busser's were kind, quick and professional.  Our server was Andrew and he was the best server I have had the pleasure of having in a long time.  Our glasses were never empty, he cared about each guest taking the time to make sure they liked their food and everything was ok.  He didn't just ask because it was his job and he was told to do it, you really got the impression he cared.  If the wait wasn't so long I would request for Andrew every time I went.    The food was excellent as expected.  We deep dish pizza, two regular pizza's, meatball sandwich, the Big Rig, and Alfredo in the dark.  For dessert we ordered 4 poozikies, two peanut butter and two chocolate chip, to share between the 12 of us.    I would recommend Oregano's but be prepared for the wait, you cannot make reservations or call ahead.  Go early and plan to wait but it is worth it!!!  If you can't afford the time to wait order take out!!!

Love this place. It's real fresh food prepared like a 5 star restaurant. I had the French toast special and my husband had the Huevos Rancheros. Both of us were extremely happy with the food and service. Jess was our waitress and she kept our coffee cups filled. She was very pleasant and a good representation of the company.  I almost didn't want to write this review in hopes we could keep this place a secret.
