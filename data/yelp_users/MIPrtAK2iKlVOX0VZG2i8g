This is the best place ever. LOVE the bruschetta boards and the super friendly service. Also, insider tip (well it's printed on the menu) but their bottled wine is discounted when you order while dining in. Their rose on the menu is just divine :) looking forward to MANY happy hours, brunches and dinner.

i was in town visiting family and friends for the holiday weekend and booked a 2 night stay at the hotel and loved my experience. i was traveling with my pup, 6 month old lab and selected the hotel because of their pet policy. they are VERY welcoming to all furry pets, both cats and dogs.   i enjoyed my stay so much i extended by an additional night. the hotel's close proximity to scottsdale quarter and Kierland Commons makes it a shopping mecca. the it's a quick 5 minute walk from the hotel room to the shops/restaurants. enjoy everything from barnes and noble and loft to the trendy H&M, express and urban outfitters.   service was great and the staff super friendly. my room was always cleaned on time and well appointed. the grounds are very well kept which makes it enjoyable for an evening stroll with the pup. looking forward to my next visit to scottsdale in the summer, i plan to stay at this hotel again.

Great place to grab a healthy lunch on the run. Their smoothies are super filling and good consistency - taste delicious and fresh. Salads are also amazing - overall speedy service, friendly and yummy! I'll definitely return when I'm in N Scottsdale. I had the PB smoothie - no changes and was perfect!

Just as the star rating says, meh... the rooms were nice, but nothing new and exciting that i haven't experienced. i think the pictures on the website do a good job of getting the customer in the door. i thought the arrival experience was COMPLETELY underwhelming. we drove up to the casino entrance which was grand and had this cool space looking statue at the round a bout, and they directed us to the front of the hotel, where guest registration was.... and that entrance was lame.   also, the pool is not every exciting. the restaurants are really amazing and yummy! probably the best thing that is going for this hotel! sleep somewhere else, but dine here!

Meh. I ordered the butternut squash soup (for pick up) and holy hell was it sweet - it seriously taste like they dumped a bag of sugar in the pot mixed it up and called it soup. I would advise against ordering the soup for an appetizer or entree. Unless you have a SUPER sweet tooth, even avoid it for dessert. My boyfriend order the burger and it was just alright, not worth the money though. Over priced and not good food.   Unfortunately I cannot comment on service since we didn't dine it. I give the menu two stars.

the food was yum! the portions are MASSIVE. they do not advertise that on their menu, so be warned. the pancakes are the size of the plate they come on (10-12in?) and stacked three high, its like eating the base of a wedding cake??  they have a really cool section of the menu that features all boozy items, probably great for a morning after hangover.   this restaurant was the best part of the SLS :)

what a great spot. to start they make life easy by allowing you to book your appointments online - glad someone has gotten the message that it's 2016! and on top of it they're very friendly. i had Jamie as my waxer - shew as very informative, did a killer job on my brows and was very friendly and meticulous - which is a GREAT quality in a waxer. i am a former europen wax center user and i plan to carry my loyalty to LunchBox. Great customer service, beautiful facility and overall an impressive experience. i will return : )

This spot is great - much more of a family vibe compared to their Indian school location but the atmosphere is on point. Our server was a bit rough around the edges (not super friendly or provided much insight to the menu favorites) but you can't really expect much for a brewery.   Food was delicious - beer selection ample and the crowd was entertaining. If you come here on a weekend around dinner time EXPECT children. Lots of them - especially outside.
