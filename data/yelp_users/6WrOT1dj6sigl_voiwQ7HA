I actually really enjoy this place. It is a super cute resturaunt built from two old phoenix houses linked together.  Most of the food is not spectacular but never bad. The mizithra cheese however is so good, the chicken marsala, amazing and flavorful, and the tuscan chicken sandwich (only available at lunch time) very craveable.    Most of the salad dressing are made on site, and while I personally am a fan of the bleu cheese, most of my friends go for the creamy pesto.  The bread is delivered fresh daily and once upon a time long long ago when I served tables here for a short time a small loaf of bread was my nightly dinner and quite satisfying.  Because I worked here I can also tell you the kitchen staff back then was always terrific and the whole place very clean.  The price and atmosphere make this a simple and enjoyable place to grab dinner with friends...or sit with your date in the trolly.  For the small prices to get soup or salad, a drink, bread, dinner and a scoop or spumoni, what more can you ask for?  Another notable fact: the location is actually ranked as one of the top haunted places in AZ.  When I worked there the power went out one night and i swear to you we could hear footsteps up in the attic!

Lovato's was the first place that I ever went to spend more than $12 dollars on a haircut. They are awesome. The place is family owned, and Art and his son Scott both had their turn at cutting my nappy hair and made it look spectacular!   I have since opted for someplace closer but often miss conversing with Scott about working out with his Ultimate Fighting friends. He often had the bruises to prove it.   Art would generally blow dry my hair making it slightly poofy and not unlike his own Frankie Avalon style, but once I got home and styled it on my own, the cut was perfect.  Mrs. Lovato, whose first name I really wish i could remember, always offered some ice cold lemonade while I waited and I always felt like an honored guest.   Scotts kids can often be found sweeping the floors in the summer and they are about the cutest things you will ever see.  For guys that like a masculine place to get their haircut, but want time and attention given to their look at the same time, this place is perfect.  They do all that chicky stuff too including waxings but I can't say that I got experience from them on that end.

This is one of my favorite little places. I always feel comfortable here. the atmosphere is quaint and the food is damned good and affordable. It makes a terrific date place. Good for conversation. The desserts always look terrific but I never save room. Best value for Japanese food that I can think of.

I have now attended a few events at Wrigley, or "The Mansion" as I like to call it.   "What are you doing tonight?" "Oh I am attending a little soiree at 'The Mansion."   I want to live here,,,and be Batman...maybe Iron Man, I haven't decided for sure.   Go here. Be Tony Stark, or Bruce Wayne for the night.  There is something indescribably awesome about donning the pocket square and having drinks and socializing in a friggin masion.  The drinks tend to be pricey but if they weren't I don't know if I would feel nearly as cool being here.   When I live here I will throw crazy UYEs so you should all be prepared to dress the nines and party all night.

When I was a kid I remember watching an episode of Jem (yeah you remember the cartoon about the hot glam chick rock band with super powers) where this kid starts going blind from sitting too close to the tv. Its ridiculous and I rather hope that I don't really remember this as much as I am making it up in my head. Anyhow this gave me a great Idea. I sat as close to the tv as humanly possible all through The Smurfs and The Snorks and Speed Racer and The Fraggles and whatever other weird cartoons I was into at the time.   Why? you may ask. Because I have always thought glasses looked sharp. They look suave and cool and smart. So I wanted some.  My prescription is light now and I can get away without them but I love them and this shop has so many frames; all of them hip...the prices may shock but we are talking designer here. The owners are knowledgeable and more helpful that you could possibly hope for.   You will not run into someone wearing your glasses on a weekly basis like when shopping from the average mall chain. This place has glasses like hotrods...seriously its like going to a car show only instead of cars they have glasses. Bitchin'!  -P.S. They don't do eye exams so don't forget to bring your prescription.  Also I wish the name were a little less girlie so that if I shop there I don't have to tell people that I got my glasses at Sassy Glasses.

I always see this place on my way to work, but it kindof looks like a Starbucks from the street. I needed my coffee fix this morning; however and the office foldgers was not going to cut it (best part of waking up my ass), so I stopped in.  This place is actually really cool. Flyers for local events posted, ratty comfortable looking furniture, completely unpretentious.  I ordered my cafe americano from a man behing the counter with Sammy Haggar curls and a rad scar on his cheek. I thought of him as a kind pirate.   My drink was up in no time flat and I am sipping it right now at work and in heaven. I know a cafe americano doesn't have that many ingredients and is difficult to screw up...but most places I go have terrible burned espresso which they graciously water down hardcore so that I can't taste it as much. This stuff is flavorful yet smooth. I will be back tomorrow morning for a cup maybe give myself enough time to try a pastry and test those chairs.

"What do you do for recreation?"  "Oh, the usual. I bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback."  I do not actually like bowling. It's my nature. I only like things that i am good at and I am not even certain I would like to be good at bowling so I had my reservations when being invited to hang with the Optimism Club kids but I love these kids so...   "Fuck it, Dude, let's go bowling."   I do have to admit; I really had a blast here. It is vintage and scummy on the outside which to me is just a bowling alley being honest with itself. It looks so old and dingy from the outside that you are slightly taken aback by the automatic doors. It's a bit like you have never seen one before and wow isn't technology amazing?  I have to say the bar service was a little slow. They rotated between three bartenders and 2/3 of them were ok so I will let it slide. The third on the other hand was probably better suited for my cube-monkey, paper-pushing job. The beers were however $2 for a domestic in a red dixie cup. It reminded me of the days I could get a red dixie cup foe $2 with free refills all night. Ahh college days...  We were here for cosmic bowling. It was somewhere around $12. I hadn't bowled in probably 5 or 6 years and I am pretty sure I paid twice that then. Great prices.   The DJ was spinning some pretty excellent tunes (hard drives spin so I can still say "spin" right?) My favorite part of the evening went something like this.  Me: "This DJ is playing some pretty decent stuff, but I think he has re-played a few songs since we've been here. Kinof lame."  Friend: "That's Cedric Ceballos."  Me: "What's Cedric Ceballos?"  Friend: "The DJ."  Me: (Looks closer at DJ) "Holy shit the DJ is Cedric fucking Ceballos!"  Sunset Bowl is pretty damned close to exactly what a bowling alley should be; and remember "This is not 'Nam. This is bowling. There are rules."

I often worry about trying new asian cuisine joints unless I have a trustworthy reccomendation, but I put on my brass cajones and took the girl to Bamboo House. Thank you baby Jesus. Their "szechuan, mandarin, and pacific cuisine" really hit the spot.  They have some of the best hot and sour soup that I have ever had in way too huge portions I would consider risking injury to make sweet love to this soup, and the eggrolls had really tasty filling.  The meal came with hot tea, which I have not had occur for awhile at any places for some reason.   Garlic shrimp..oh how I love you and will love you again cold when I am drunk and browsing the fridge this weekend...big tasty tender shrimps...mmmm. The Pad Thai...I may request a tad spicier next time but was overall completely delicious. The shrimp and chicken in it make my mouth water right now.  We were happy to take home the leftovers and if they are the only thing in the new fridge when we get moved tomorrow I will consider it the hippest fridge that ever was to be full of such midnight snack worthy leftovers.

When I have to go to Starbucks (and because of my girlfriend's Caramel Machiatto with too many shot addiction i often do) this is the one that pisses me off the least. I have had a string of bad luck with service and drinks at other locations but the people working at this location really have their shit together.   The espresso is hardly ever even burned! Almost everyone who works here is sweet as daisies and they even occassionally let me out with my black coffee for free.   The location is generally quiet and well behaved as far as patrons go so I don't even mind hanging out for a bit to work on my crosswords.  This location does a great job of reminding me that Starbucks was once a neighborhood coffee house with good business values.

Marc's can be one star or 5 depending on the night.  It is one of my go-to bars so I decided to give it the benefit of 4 stars. Don't get me wrong I love this place. How can you go wrong with Karaoke 7 days a week? There is also a seperate side for hip hop music and dancing. They have a stage so that you can have the full rockstar experience though most people don't use it so it is by no means necessary.   Drinks are strong and cheap. The seats are comfortable and loungy. The singing....depends on the crowd. The crowd changes a lot night to night despite the high doses of regulars. This tends to really be the downside...some night you get the hard rock cut up metallica t shirt crowd. metallica is ok but not much of a karaoke choice...then again if you are into it all power to you.  The restoom on the Karaoke side is Ally McBealled, meaning unisex which is always a fun way to make friends. You can generally mix your crowd with another. Quite the social anamole. Based on friends reactions this place is not for everyone..but if it isn't you are uppity. ahem.

Let's face it....I am irresponsible...no no don't argue I need to accept this one.   I pay this bill just before they sell my stuff every time. Seriously. They are so good about calling to let me know and never make me feel embarassed about it. They are still super sweet to me from the first "your payment is late call" to me paying the $300 I owe them for three months of storing $230 worth of stuff.   They even called to let me know they had noticed that I locked my unit incorrectly, and it could be opened. (I told you I am irresponsible).  I treat them poorly and they continuously give me great service (reminds me of this girl I used to date only without the crazy)  I would reccomend them!

So I really needed a fuzzy Bob Marley blanket to black out my windows so we decided to go to the indoor swap mart (this is not true, simply an attempt at humor and a real life assumption on why most people purposely visit here.)  They have everything from smoking paraphanelia, to naked lady ass beach towels.  Seriously... there are a few bargains to be found here maybe...like nick nacks and lighters and fair food, but seriously this place is pure entertainment value otherwise. I joked that they should have a tattoo parlor because the place really made me feel the need to be tattooed...and sure enough moments later we walked by a tattoo parlor..at...the..indoor swap mart! jesus people.  They did have yummy giant pickles and corndogs!

My favorite thing about the Phoenix Art Museum is that they manage to showcase southwestern art without it being the total theme of the museum. I am not much of a fan of cowboy painings and whatnot but I can appreciate them when I can also cart around to modern art, sculpture, photography, classic art and the likes.  They also get some great special exhibits! I actually got a chance to work for their audio tour company during Norman Rockwell and China's Forbidden City and it was tons of fun!  I feel like I should find the gift shop more lame than I do. They have terrific magnets, local jewlery, shirts, books, even dishes. It's like one of those nifty calalogs that come in the mail with random things you never knew that you wanted.  The staff is my experience has always been helpful and pleasant.   How can you not love this place?

"To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting."  ~e.e. cummings, 1955  Bikini is a true dive bar. It is not a bar trying to be your local neighborhood dive, it in genuine; comfortable in it's own skin no matter how gross and disease infested that skin may be; not unlike the loveable PigPen from the Peanuts cartoons. Bikini tries to live up to no one's standards and despite the array of negative things one can say about the place, it is part of its charm and it's charm will win you over.   My friend ordered a tequila the other night.   "Do you want the Well or Jose Cuervo?"   I was shocked so I made the inquiry. "Pardon me; out of curiosity what is your well tequila? What can you possibly have worse than Jose Cuervo?"  "Two Fingers. Some peoplelike it." --matter of factly in between loud bites of her greasy fish and chips from some near by establishment.  They don't give a fuck.  Tiki stuff is posted all over of course, but not like Island's or Chuy's this is some real old looking tiki stuff. It somehow avoids the tacky factor and remains dingy. Flawless execution again WITHOUT TRYING.   Even the bathrooms keep it real. Real gross so poo before you go. You do not want to touch anything in here that you can avoid touching.  There is a front and a back door. I assume this is so that if your date's sheet metal worker husband comesin the front door you can easily bolt out the back. I assume this happens all the time here. Never seen it but it looks the type of place. I like that in a bar.  The drinks are cheap and the drinks are strong.  "Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind."  ~Dr. Seuss  P.S. Other points of note  -internet juke box -DJ every night at 10pm -Cash only. ATM charges $2.50 I believe.

I have never felt so cool, while trying so little, as when I am gulping down martinis at Char's.  This is the type of place that holds the idea of the smoky atmosphere even without the smoke. Everytime I go here I feel as though I have stepped back in time to a place where the blues are king, and the gin comes in a tub.  The music is loud, the dancefloor is crowded and the bathrooms are tiny...in short this place is amazing.   Hang out with the hippest of cats, from all demographics.   Please do not order girlie mixed shots with silly names as it makes the ghost of Robert Johnson cry when these sorts of things grace the bars of such genuine gin joints.  The drinks are simple, the music is great and the company can't be beat!

For those of you who don't "habla Espanol", Mi Patio is Spanish for.. My Patio.  We have already heard from umpteen people that there is no patio. That is the point! Get it?! it's a metaphor. The whole restaurant is the patio! amazing.  The quesapilla. It is a sopapilla...giant one...full of cheese...oh fluffy greasy goodness.   Now...this place would have to be pretty bad to suck when they offer margaritas for a mere 4 George Washingtons: one paper and three terminator washingtons (quarters) For those of you who don't habla gibberish that is $1.75. ($9 a pitcher(a big pitcher))  Eat. Drink. Be whatever the hell you want to be.

Put on your eating shoes for this place...as you will be doing some heavy duty eating. The fry bread is loaded and greasy and dripping and...in a word AMAZING.  The red chilli soaks in to the fry bread which is completely perfect to begin with and sinful when topped with stuff. (like said red chilli) Whatever the step after sinful is, is what the frybread becomes when you drown it in the hotsauce. I am a big sauce guy. this is a big sauce. I would totally eat your granmother if she were drizzled in it.  Parking is a pain but it is well worth it. If you must, just park down the street. You are in the melrose district anyhow. Hit up Copperstar Coffee on the way or shop for your favorite record in Revolver Record store. Its the greatest area in the Valley.   You will not leave disapointed unless I get there first and eat  up all the frybread.  I am making myself hungry...I wonder if I can make it before 7.

My grandfather finds anyplace with a diner feel and huge portions to be the cat's meow regardless of the quality of food. Eye openers would fit his bill and not make the rest of the family cringe because the food is good! Really really it is!  The term homestyle was created for Eye Opener. The food was delicious and as mentioned by the other Yelpers there homemade hummus makes the heart happy.  Have you ever had a server who could pretty much get nothing right but somehow you would forgive her because she is that friendly and on top of the issues? Yeah that was them. They ran out of menus and any less of a server might let us feel annoyed at this gal was on it and friendly and you had to love her. The owner checked on us several times with a genuine sense of caring.  I think I am taking my grandpa to breakfast tomorrow.

The drive through is open until 3. Oh sweet savior of late night chicken wings. Strangely however there is no menu posted at the drive-through so we decided to go inside...but it was closed. What to do? No problem. Jeramiah let us inside to order and even offered to let us stay and eat. The wings were magnificent. Crispy but not overdone with delicious sweet spicy sause of some kind.  Jeramiah was a bit discontent with his job and wanted to share. I was in just the right mood to really enjoy his ramblings about his superiors. He was super personable and after taking the order went back to cook it up himself.  Did I mention the wings rocked? The sandwich was pretty good, but the wings really drive the stars up, and right across the street from my apartment! No more mushy dominoes hot wings for this guy.

Remember that scene in Lady and the Tramp with the spaghetti...don't lie. you remember. Anzios always reminds me of that scene. Small, quaint, the little checkered table cloths. Its adorable.  They have great pizza. there is something special about the crust and thick cheese that they use and the mild yet tasty sauce.   The salads are always perfectly chilled, perfect lettuce. The hotwings are making my mouth water thinking about them.  The service has always been terrific. I have been going for years and have not had one single bad experience. They are prompt and friendly but not clingy to the table. and Its been awhile but 30 cent wing night was always something a little special.

This is a west side liquor store fo shiz. And it aint' no Bevmo punk; so take your collar popping ass up the road if you want clean and pretty. If it is a crotch flask or a 40 of OE, however; this is the place to rock.  I exaggerate a bit. While certainly rough around the edges this is a good place to get your booze, complete with drive through.  I stopped in to pick up some supplies to throw an after OYE bash. The guy working the counter looked at my bottle of 15 dollar Smirnoff triple distilled and he says to me "You want better vodka for cheaper?"    Does he not know me at all? Why even ask? I course I effing want better vodka for cheaper, so he took my bottle put it back and grabbed a 12 dollar bottle. I am a happy camper.  Yay! I'm a fan...cuz ..you know they sell liquor...and they do it well.

I was being my usual indecisive self about what to have for dinner last night, when the girlfriend frusteratedly pulled in to Ming's. I have seen this place at the foot of Shaw Butte Mountain many times but never eaten there and I am glad that we did!  We were greeted possibly more enthusiastically than I have ever been greeted at the door. This was one friendly server and must have had something to do with management or ownership to be that excited to be there. He was indeed our server as well and the enthusiasm and friendliness lasted the whole meal.  The food had flavor. Not an overall mushy Chinese dish whatever flavor either. Each piece of each dish was individually flavored yet well tied. The tiny little corn on the cobs tasted like corn, the pea pods like pea pods and Jesus H. the shrimp tasted like shrimp, not the thawed shrimp textured blandness that you often get from an inexpensive meal.  We each had soup and an eggroll then shared pork fried rice and two other dishes which were all delicious and totalled less than $30 dollars. amazing prices.  The only down side really was the scallops. they were a little chewy, but hell they were $7!  The decor is average chinese food place but there is a seperate bar attached which we did not get a chance to check out but may be in the near future.

The Baconator. How can you not?   I rather like Wendy's for fast food...There is just something about those square hamburgers...You know like the Huey Lewis song.  The hamburger is amazing, two square patties, something around a billion pieces of bacon and cheese dripping enoughh off the sides to leave you a delicious desert of lickable cheese paper.  I have a thing for their soggy salty fries, it is hard to scoop up frosty with them, but once you do you are in freakish eater heaven. The salt and chocolate are just the right combination.  This peticular resturaunt was lame, even by fast food standards. The drive-through was not friendly, I got only two napkins, no spoon for my frosty (thank god for the fries) and no offer of ketchup.  The Baconator will be back...and soon, and I doubt that you want to use a Wendy's bathroom so take it home.

It's Taco Bell...A fast food chain...How anti-Yelp of me. I may even get a talk thread all about me as an example of all things wrong with Yelp..But I eat TB alot and frankly each deserves a different rating so why not give it a go?   If you need your fix of burrito with fillings from a caulking gun I would reccomend you drive to the next TB since they are on every corner and this one is sub par. My half pound cheesy bean burrito weighed nowhere near a half pound and while I can't figure out which layer was missing there were definately only 6 layers in my 7 layer burrito.   There is a Del Taco across the street; what was I thinking?  On the plus side when I say alot of fire sauce, I mean it and they complied.

Romanelli's is the most amazing italian deli that one can ever come across in Phoenix.   It is located down the street from the high school that I went to and we used to stop most days for some cheese pizza or "Italian Stallion" sandwich. Now that I have grown this is a prime place to shop for my own culinary needs such as pastas, cold cuts, pizza toppings, sauces and even hommade pizza dough just waiting to be thawed and used to make your own delicious pizzas.  I still stop in for the occassional sandwish and the "Italian Stallion" is still my top choice. Ham, capicolla,  grnoa salami, pepperoni and provalone cheese piles high with onions thinnly shredded lettuce tomatoes and of course bread soggy with dressing as it should be. And don't forget to follow it up with your favorite italian sweet. I haven't had a bad dessert yet.  The service is prompt and charmingly brusque. A real New York feeling here.   If its authenticity you are after this is your place..anywhere else? Fuggedaboudit!!

This used to be a frequent hang out spot for me. We would buy the biggest cheapest cigars that we could find, sit in the lounge with the old men, watch CNN and play game after game of chess.   I finally made it back this weekend to pick up a few cigars. The staff is friendly and helpful, the atmosphere is perfectly dark and denish. They still have the lounge so you can smoke em' there. They told me that hardly anyone ever gets out the chess board anymore and I told them I may have to change that.  The selection is great and they always have some good deals going on. I paid for barely over half of the cigars I picked up.  Monthly cigar tasting on the second saturday of each month, that I have not yet made it to but the deals sound great when you attend.  Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar...but other times it is a game of chess and a way to ditch the world for a half hour on a comfy couch with old timers tellin ya their stories.

Do not...I repeat DO NOT, go here expecting mexican food....This is not your run of the mills strip mall bertos as it may at first glance appear from the front.  I have been meaning to try this resturaunt for some time and finally made the leap; taking my cousin along who has spent a few years in ecuador so I might get some advice on what to order; though it turned out that we ate just about a little of everything so it didn't matter.  She jumped around with excitement at all the authentic ecuadorian knick nacks and doo dads decorating the shelves and walls.  The flavors of the food were indescribably big and we both jumped aound the plate changing which was our new favorite food based on what we had taken a bit of last. from the Ceviche to the cookies and drinks; nothing disappointed even one bit.   This is my new favorite resturaunt, number one reccomendation and the first place I will take any out-of-towners from now on!

This was my favorite dive bar back when I thought a dive bar had to be absolutely rank. I recently returned a few times after years of having been away and realized why i had stayed away so long.   The service varies depending who your server is. The beer is awful. Just a shitty selection. Really effing shitty. I seemed to remember their buffalo chicken strips being delicious but I must have been drunk out of my goddamned gourd. They were dry and had almost no sauce. Oh and don't listen to what anyone may tell you...LandShark is not tasty beer.  I also remembered why this is the only bar I have been kicked out of for getting into altercations. Almost all of the patrons were ass hats speaking total douchery and making me sick to my stomach as they used their smooth lines on the waitress such as "Why don't you want to go home with my friend? He is hung like a horse. Har har har"  Never have I been to a bar with so many children seated at the booths. "You have a baby!...at a bar..."  "OK so why two stars Nathan?" you may be asking yourself,  "you seem to be really getting riled up about this place, why not give it one?"  The jalepeno cheese steak sandwich is sooo effing good. Dirty real dive bar food...sooo good. Go during the day when no one is there and do not drink the Land Shark...it is not tasty beer.

Greatest gyros in town!   Paul C. and myself tried one of the more expensive, fancier, Rep rated trend joints and there was no comparison.   What they lack in atmosphere they make up for with delicious food and great service!   One time I spilled tzaziki sauce on my shoe and nearly ate it without thinking...that's how good the stuff is.   They would be the perfect sunday lunch place if only they were open on Sunday.

I was here for a 21st birthday party. This place is a 21st birthday party. Lots of fun when you are 21....  If Jimmy Buffet and Hunter S Thompson were hanging out tripped the fuck out on acid and decided to open a bar together it would look something like this place only with more fire arms. Somehow this still doesn't work that well.  There is a swing at the end of the bar obviously of the sex variety. I mean what other purpose could it serve?   You can pay for spins on a wheel of fortune type wheel that is marked with crazy mixed drinks that I am too old to drink. No matter what you spin you can consider it bankrupt. one of the drinks is served in a plunger...I assume the rubber is not the easiest thing to sanitize.   Overall summary is that this place is made for 21st birthdays and you are immediately too old the next day.

So imagine the following scenario: You are browsing the sunday paper and hurray! You come across the funnies, you save Family Circus for last because it is a classic and surely will not disapoint. You get through everything else and at long last come to the Family Circus and after finishing, you remember that in fact; you have never read a funny Family Circus. In fact the only ones you find slightly enjoyable are the ones where little Billy is running around all hopped up on drugs and there is a dotted line left in his trail and you don't really get them either.  I am sure you are wondering where I am going with this. Sugar Bowl posts Family Circus comics all around the establishment and it is fitting as they are similar, in that you really think that you are going to enjoy both but both are huge let-downs.  I would really like to give this place one 1 1/2 stars but you know how it goes; I am a positive guy so I will round up.   The thing is, sugar bowl is just the kind of place that a Yelper WANTS to like. It has been around for 50 years, locally owned and operated, it breaks the Scottsdale douche mold/stereotype and it is old school. It just doesn't manage to be charming and here is why.  First and foremost; the service sucked. When I went in, there were as many teenage kids working as people in the place and though I received a water super promply; giving me false high-hopes; I was then forced to wave down kids walking around avoiding eye contact like we had woken up together after a too-drunk night; in order to get water refills and order a burger.   Secondly the food was meh. Really meh. Yeah I know it is an icecream joint but an old ice cream shop like this should have some tasty old-school burgers. You know who has better burgers? Dairy Queen. I swear to YHWH. Even the ice cream was very, very run of the mill.  Even the decor, while I enjoy the old soda shop sort of thing needs a little help. There are creepy old people houses and there are charming ones; figure out the difference really.  I am going to go beyond my jurasdiction here and give some suggestions hoping someone takes them to heart. I mean I don't know much; I am just a consumer but as a jumping point... I hate to say this but Sugar bowl needs to let the theme run a bit with the Scottsdale atmosphere. Scottsdale wants to be LA and Sugar Bowl should also but they should do it better!  Scottsdale needs a hip late-night diner! Think about it! Get some great food stuffs, make your own toppings stay open late and charge a little more. And for the love of god take down the comics and paint the damn place or something! It could be a swingin joint where rock-stars, porn-stars and sport-stars meet up with the after club crowd. Look at how far people go to make it to Five and Diner and they aren't truly that great. Out-do them!  Sugar Bowl could do it. They really have the potential but as is I would have to be pretty desperate to hit this place up again.

The Grape Vine is one of the best venues in AZ to catch a Nathan S. show and believe me everyone should experience a Nathan S. show at some point in their lives. He is as talented and energetic a performer as the world has ever seen.  I don't know what else goes on in this establishment but I do know that the karaoke here is tits or bitchin or whatever Scottsdale language is these days for neat-o. The song selection is fantastic, the crowd is awesome and most importantly they have a stage! I am a little bit of a performance god (see ham) and love a good karaoke stage. Watch me people, envy me, let me get you off! I am a golden God!!!  Ahem...The patio is awesome and large. The drinks could stand to be cheaper for this type of bar but I guess when you drop it in the neighborhood that it is dropped in you have to do as the Romans (See vomitorium).  P.S. I am hungover and haven't a goddamned clue what most of this review means.

I have always wanted to write one of these reviews as a letter to a personified establishment. Like the cool kids.  Sweetest Haji Baba,  I am so happy that I waited for you. Had I lost my falafel virginity to anyone but you I surely would have regretted it. Thank you for knowing I was ready to be deflowered. The taste of your falafel lingers on my lips when I think of that day.  I thought we may be a fling, but you are so deep. You have two sides, delicious dining, and grocery I think I am in love. The way your staff is friendly and seem to actually appreciate my business leaves me longing for your sweet lunch.  Your plate of olives is like a plate of olives, heavenly aroma building my hunger for you.   Distance makes the heart grow fonder love, and next time I find myself in Tempe, we will be as though we never parted. Wait for me.  Your dearest, Nathan "Bear Hands" S.

Once upon a time I was a young lad with a powerful hunger for life and meat. I used to love going to Chuy's. Tri tip sammiches FTW I would have pronounced had FTW not still carried the Tupac meaning back when I liked it...yeah the good ol days. How the mighty have fallen.  After a trip to Ikea that went a bit too late to get my lingonberry fix, my companion and I were famished. One of the first places my navigation brought up in the area was  Chuy's. Hey right on, my generation digs nostalgia.   The folks working were nice enough...I love the idea of serve yourself all you can eat chips and salsa, I forgot they have a bar, hey things are looking good....until.  I don't know if the stale chips just put me off enough to realize that Chuy's looks like my ex's parents bedroom after they refinanced their house to take out an equity loan in order to make their bedroom look like a Margaritaville restaurant. Parrot Heads. They did a half-assed job and so did Chuy's. It lacks the charm I remember the old Metro Center location having.  The chips were stale, the salsa was lame, the tri-tip was dry. The service was ok but apparently Wednesday night is the night to visit your buddy who works at Chuy's and get your drink on..I dunno maybe it's just short of payday and you couldn't afford your meds so this seemed like a good idea at the time.   Point being I had to (got to?) listen to a loud conversation about a guy's terrible luck. He got pulled over speeding while hauling a trailer that he knew had no lights and got ticketed for everything he was doing wrong, Next day his wife got mad at him and busted a window in their house, later she burned his trailer down, ater again while "partying" he accidently hit the panic button on his friends house alarm causing the police to come to their rescue only to find 3 men with a pile of coke, entertaining a hooker. you aren't unlucky bro, you have bad judgement and worse taste in women.  Sigh. If you dragged me to Chuy's I would go I guess...maybe...for childhood Nathan's sake.

Turns out, my aura is mostly purple, with some yellow mixed in and a bright red orb in my sexy area....I know this because I have had my aura photo taken here twice. If anyone knows what this means i would be interested to find out if you think it matched my sparkling me-ness.  This place has spiritual books, sage, athames, angel stuff, t-shirts...It's like the gift shop to a non-biased heaven. It is a good spot for any budding spiritualist to get a start and the experienced to get supplies.  I love the aura photos obviously, and they also have tarot readings and chakra alignment classes and whatnot. Plenty of really cool stuff to keep ya in the light...whatever your light may be.

They have pomade...serious greaser pomade...how cool is that?  I own a purple couch. It is a huge sectional with no arms and a low back...not that comfy but jesus is it vintage. I bought it at Go-Kat-Go. The woman who I think owns the place actually helped me load it into my truck. This place is cool, their products are always changing, and the staff is super helpful and friendly. I never feel like I need to be cool enough to shop there.  They have those kitschy jesus statues and virgin mary candles that I have a strange love of in bulk.   They are more rock-a-billy than you will ever know.

I had to meet someone here because I had to interview him for this thing I am writing about him. You might have seen me. I was the guy dressed like pre-success David Foster Wallace. The contract scrawled on a napkin and signed at the bar before the passing of an envelope of money prevents me from giving any more detail.   Also this story makes me seem way more awesome when it's left a little blurry... blurry like I started to get after a few strongly poured cocktails at the bar. Thank FSM I had my tape recorder rolling.  Also thank goodness the meal was in the contract, because the place aint cheap. But a rare prime rib, crispy on the outside baked potato, oysters, crazy good bread, are worth it if you have it. I just soaked the front of my shirt with my Pavlovian salivation.  This place is classy as hell and all Rat Pack feeling. Yeah, I assume every review of this place has some reference to the Rat Pack in it but I didn't read any so I'm not going to feel bad about it.   I don't know how I managed to make it to 30 before my first trip here. I'm a Phoenix kid and it's a Phoenix staple. The crowd was a little Luby's but I like old people. It's cool.

Holy cow I finally found spicy jerk chicken. Do not...I repeat, do not order the jerk chicken and the red diablo together with jerk fried rice, all were delicious, but together it felt like I had swallowed a live wolverine. I love the combinations here.  the girl got teriaki and red jade chicken which i tried and both were also quite yummy.  The only regret I have is not ordering a dozen snickerdoodles to go. Jesus those things taste like angels! We will be back far too often i am sure.

I had never been to FEZ aside from the OYE. Why oh why?!  Even though I want to marry Thomas, I told myself no matter what I will go with a blank opinion and write a fair review. It really didn't matter the meal was spectacular.  I had friends in town from San Fran and decided to trust FEZ with the dificult task of making Phoenix impressive.   The atmosphere is simply hip. The service, fantastic. The food....oh sweet food baby jesus. Thomas suggested the one burger I was going to refuse to try: The FEZ burger. It has pears on it for christ's sake. A burger should not have fruit besides the disputer fruit/vegi, the tomato...or should it? Apparently it should. This has to litterally be the best burger I have ever had in my life. I even ate the second half of the girlfriends for lunch reheated the next day and once again had a tantric, sting style foodgasm.  The Strawberry Blueberry something or another slad was ordered by another in the group and she was most pleased.  The appetizers..holy lord...The hummus was as good as I remembered fromt he elite event, as were the sweet potato fries, and those other fries, the name of which I can't recall were wonderfully spicy, and all three dipping sauces made my day.  The drinks were delicious and not weak at all.   If I could eat every meal at FEZ I think that I would. I may have a hard time eating anything but the FEZ Burger...It's that delicious.

Of any wine store that I have ever been to I get the best service at Magnum's. The staff here is super knowlegable and friendly. I actually feel like they enjoy helping me find a bottle of wine for $8 that tasted really close to a $60 one that I tried once. They have even helped me hunt down bottles based on a vague description of the label.  The guy working this weekend chatted with me a bit and upon going to the lounge bar area to get me a bottle of Seven Deadly Zins (they use it as their house wine. can't beat that.) took me on a brief tour. I have never spent any time in the lounge but it is hip and cool and...ready for this? ..you can smoke...they sell 51% tobacco, so based on current smoking laws they can allow you to light up a stoagie while you enjoy your drink. Ahh reminds me of the good old days.  For their service alone I would give six stars if possible. Love it!

What can I say That Ayesha didn't already cover? I love breakfast..and I love butter. Breakfast + butter + more butter = Matt's.   I had an omelette which was filled with delicious cheese and as Ayesha mentioned the mushrooms had been cooked up in butter before going into the mix which is how I do it at home. The eggs were fluffy and delicious. The toast was thick. THICK.   Yes the wait was long. The windows are huge so you can make those already eating uncomfortable by staring at them as they eat which is sort of fun right?  The shooting pain in my left arm makes it hard to type, but with the smile on my face I am forced to try to put out this one last review before my early death to butter clogged arteries.   They also got a boost when on the way out every single staff member shouted to us thank yous, and have a good days, and come back soons. Sweet folks. I will have to go back after the bypass surgery.

Yes it's a little dirty...yes it smells like dusty old books...yes it's a little bit sloppy and disorganized; but isn't that half the fun?  I generally go into bookmans with nothing whatsoever in mind to buy, randomly browse shelves and leave with wonderful treasures.   The only time I have a mission here is when I go looking for pre-movie book covers(i have an obsessive hatrid of movie book covers) And I found Fear and Loathing and High Fidelity pretty quickly my last two trips.  I also love that they have used magazines. I am a mag junkie and this saves me so much money and lets me know what the highest fashion was in 1986.  They also have a dirty mag closet if you are brave but used porno freaks me the hell out.  My only complaint is that the staff here never seems very helpful or happy to be there. If I worked at a used book store I would be smilier than Ron Jeremy...Well maybe almost as smily as.  The vinyl is a bit like shopping thrift store but it's ok I really like the process of digging for that perfect find.  All in all, good stuff.

I used to frequent this joint before I moved to Vegas. Now I am back and finally made my return trip. Is it p[ossible they got better? It must be because they did.  It used to be a gas station, which is suiting as I run off coffee just like my car on gasoline, though I pay more per gallon for mine. Comfy couches, hip artwork, tons of music that is on my ipod playlist anyhow, I love this place.  I had possibly the best tuna fish sandwich that I have ever had in my life. Lemon ginger something or another...devine. Also iced green tea as I was feeling a bit ill and in need of rehydration. Hit the spot and has free refills all day. I would also reccomend the baked goods, as they are fresh baked and completely sinfully , irresistable  The service is friendly and efficent just as I remember it. Anytime I have been here I was treated kindly, politely, and rather like a friend.   This is one of my favorite spots in the valley and when I retire at short bursts I try to visit daily.

I love me some IKEA. A friend of mine once told me that IKEA is gay Mecca which makes me feel that they have spot on decorating (nothing wrong with positive stereotypes right?)   Affordable and stylish and frankly a corporation that as far as I can tell really cares. They like to keep it green and whatnot.  Yes some of the things are not the sturdiest or anything that you will pass on to future generations of style savvy kids, but it is priced accordingly and not misrepresented.   The best part about the store is that everything is set up in actual decorated rooms so you can get ideas of how to use items and even if you don't like a peticular piece they have you can rip off the decorating ideas.  And the food. Lord do I love me some Lingonberries...swedish meatballs swimmin in gravy dipped in some lingonberries and  you have a happy Nathan S. If it were not so far I would grocery shop here. The swedish know how to eat and sell the yummy little viddles downstairs to take home.   Also swedish coffee rocks.

I finally got the chance to visit Lola on my way home from a poetry reading at the Phoenix Art Museum Last night..(Side note: If you get the chance to see Aaron Johnson read, do so.)  I somehow feel the need to appologize for the lack of stars to all of you who seem to love this place. I would certainly be willing to give it another try but I was not impressed.  First the music is loud, and therefore everyone talking in the place turns up the volume and as my girlfriend and I were seated across from each other at the communal table we could barely reach to share the food let alone hear each other.  Why are the tables so big if the food is so small? Maybe I am a bit of a glutton, but for 8 dollars I essentially ate a mushroom for dinner...Don't get me wrong it was tasty, and I understand Tapas are appetizers, but 8 dollars? I was disapointed. I used to go to Firefly in Vegas and it was cheaper and tastier.  We just wanted to try this place and move on someplace quieter, but I was really looking forward to it...We decided not to have drinks and simply share one thing so we could get to said quieter place before it got too late...I think because we ordered so little, the waitress considered us a waste as far as her tips were concerned and therefore seemed not so friendly...and those little bitty glasses of water they bring...I drank immediately and it was never refilled.   I was overall not impressed by anything except a patron's sweet ass Salvador Dali Mustache. I can see the charm there and I probably will give it another shot but based on this trip 2 stars is fairer than fair.

Es schmeckt sehr lecker!  That's German!  I have been to Haus Murphy's to drink a few times in the past and was quite pleased by the beer selection as well as the size. I can get beer in a stein the size of my head? Surely you jest. I have a rather large melon. It is true though. The effer is huge and tasty.  I finally got to eat here with my favorite collection of Brite girls. The whole place feels rather authentic though I have never been to  Germany so what do I know? Everything I know about Germany I learned from Polka and online pornography (I think they love the Hoff).   Community tables were not uncomfortable as they can be other places. They were quite cozy and enjoyable in fact.  The food while unpronounceable was very delicious. In fact I have been told that my opening line means "It's delicious" however as previously stated I know nothing of German so it could very well mean *insert funnt profane thing here*  Sauerkraut has become one of my favorite things in the world  and It does not disappoint here. The sausages were delicious and the beer made it all just a happy dining sort of day.  Also how can you go wrong with two old men in lederhosen playing the oompah oompah on a tuba and an accordion. These guys are rock stars. You learn to play these instruments solely to get chicks.  Srsly...I know you uppity east sider kids like to stear clear of the avenues except to take in some hipster-slumming it culture, but downtown Glendale has so much to offer. Haus Murphy's is amazing and it is nestled amongst little antique shops and whatnot with brick and lace and charm. Give it a shot.   Tell them "Du hast meine Katze auf dem Fenster geworfen!"

Thank you Amy D. for reccomending Harley's so highly. The girl and I stepped out last night to get out of the house and have a bite and accidently drove by and decided to give it a try.  We got Amy's favorite server Justin, who was awesome! (mind you I think knowing Amy D. gor us the VIP treatment) Friendly and attentive and great with advice on what to order.   We started with some appetizer that I wish I could remember the name of. It was mozzeralla between white bread, which was then breaded and fired...essentially a breaded grilled cheese sandwhich with marinara over top. Oh my god it was amazing!   We each ordered the Pollo Marsala, though I was worried as I am picky about my marsalla and am almost always disapointed when I order it. It was sweeter than I expected, which was incredibly OK. It was so wonderful I wish I had leftovers for lunch today but my willpower was weak and I ate it all including the fetuccini alfredo on the side which was equally flavorful and delish!  All of the sauces were far from bland and far from generic. Justin informed us that they don't make the sauces in huge batches but fresh and to order.   The prices are incredibly fair and left money in the account to give the generous tip that Justin deserved. We will be back much more often than we should I am sure.   Justin also reccomended the desserts but there was simply no room in the tummy last night.

Hipster Mecca.   Come here for new vinyl, not for the old stuff. They have all the hip, indie stuff on brand-new, in the package, hot off the press vinyl.  Come here for indie stuff. If you want to get that look that says someone has recognized your coolness for requesting The Fireman (look it up if you don't know. I mean it) this is the place. The people who work here are super-helpful, super-knowledgable, super friendly and have super-powers (one of these things is not entirely true).  They are so in the loop that it makes you feel really cool if you stump them, like let's day you walk in and say "Hey is that Tim Seely album out yet?" and they say "Who?" and you get that look like "I got you bitch, I got you!(playfully of course)" then they give you that look like "oh man you got me!" Then  you give them the Mentos smile and elaborate "The dude from Actual Tigers." On a related note I am really awesome.  They offer to order anything you can't find.   My one complaint is the way the used CDs are set up in the tiny cubbies up top makes it hard to scan them but it is a small complaint for such a charming place.

Does it make me less of a man to say that I LOVE Frances?  Vintage, hip, different. I have been to this store many times with my girlfriend. They have very little in the way of men's items and what they do have is generally for the more petite men than myself...but...  I could easily shop here for every gift giving occasion for my girlfriend or any of the other women in my life. They have far out jewlery, and clothes, the most attractive item of clothing i have ever seen my girlfriend wear was a dress from here that she tried on and decided she would never wear so didn't purchase it. bummer.  I enjoy looking around...it is like a museum set up to display all the things that a woman I date should fancy and wear. The prices can be up there but some items are very fair and frankly for the quality and origionality of the items I find them worth the price if you can pay it.

I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one;  a male dog. however is. Buckley Minster Fullerinne 101 Simpson is my pride and joy, but everything is not always perfect. I have to admit to you that... Sometimes... he... STINKS. Just sometimes.   He also loves to play in the lake at the dog park and his white parts all become muddy brown parts. He gets dirty.   I tried bathing him at home once...If those walls could talk they would say "Jesus man! Control your dog; I am soaking wet!" Well the right tool for the right job, I always say.  Wag n Wash has the right tools. It's a wash your own dog sort of place with all the hooks, leashes, nozzles and soaps to get your dog cleaned right. They even have special doggie colognes yo give your dog that extra edge with the ladies.  Besides the dog bathing they have a great array of dog foods, treats (some fresh baked), toys, dishes, leashes, beds, tags, you name it they got it. Great stuff. Buckley loves to browse and I always pick up a tub of training treats because Buckley loves them and needs all the training he can get.

Qcumber is a lot like when a relative dies and you have to sort through all of their stuff for what you would like to keep only without the grief of the death.  They are full, full, full of great dusty old things. There are amazing finds to be had here.   I have a thing for old cameras and have bought a couple here, I have a few retro chairs that I have bought. They always have amazing olf furniture of every style.  My favorite part about Qcumber is the old window panes, doors and iron pieces. This is the kind of place that you see people on the DIY network visiting and wonder why you don't have one near.  Good News! You do!  Look past the dust and appreciate the treasures to be found.

Is it a bar! It's a restaurant! It's Cornish Pasty Company! Dum do de dum.  The music is superb. Elvis Costello anyone? Yes please. The beer selection while I didn't partake this trip is A+.The food....yes!  I met the lovely Sarah G. here and loudly remarked on her review point of a pasty being "a glorified hot pocket" just as our waitress came by. Oops.  English accent? Check.  As stated a brazilian times the chicken tiki masala is tops. They come split in half so Sarah and I traded halves and I also got to try the pilgrim. Definitely amped my excitement for turkey day. both selections were tops.  I want to go here and drink and eat like a king one night.   Sarah changed her tune and decided it was definitely better than her last trip and even grabbed a few uncooked to feed the family that night. How cool is that?

Describing the Lost Leaf, I feel like I shouldn't like it...but I really really do.  There is no signage out front so I was very timid approaching from the outside but once I did boy was I glad.  Most of the art I have seen on the walls is so bad it is good. They rotate it out so I have to assume there is occassionally great stuff up.   No beer on tap? WTF? And I have never heard of most of the beers...Thats ok, ask the staff for reccomendations based on what you like and you won't be disapointed. I had a beer in a wine sized bottle...how cool am I now?  In the back room they have live music and things of this nature. A stand up bass...I am in!  Seriously this place in unpretentiously pretentious. or the other way around. One way or the other it is a great place to meet up and have a laid back great time.

Live crabs in barrels! Whole fish! Gross weird things I have never seen!  I love this market. i used to live down the street and loved to pick up some yummy fishes and all sorts of noodles and whatever Asian spices smelled perfect for the night.  I had no idea what i was doing half the time but the ingredients made themselves.  The fish was all fresh and the whole store interesting. I don't think I am a fan of boba. I love this store I love this store. I love this store.

OK so I am a fan of the gay bars. Shocked? Didn't think so. I also like karaoke. Shocked now? I leave nothing to surprise. I love this bar.  The patrons tend to choose awful songs for karaoke but somehow it works out as charming here. Everyone is super gracious and friendly; very welcoming to new singers.   The patio is terrific. Roomy, friendly and plenty of seating for the smokers and always someone to light up your smoke.   The drinks are reasonable and well poured and the bartenders are good people.   Just your friendly neighborhood dive bar...with a rainbow flag.

I haven't used this place yet but I stopped in with a friend who was looking for some glasses and I was impressed.  It's just a small store in metro center mall but they have some great frames. The guy who runs the joint helped us out and made suggestions on frames to fit her face and similar selections to those she liked. He really knew his product.  He also had great knowledge of the prescriptions and what he could do with each frame shape and size. he was a tad eccentric which added to my belief that he is a goddamned genius. I took a few extra cards from him to hand out. I will definately be going back for my next pair of glasses.   The prices are also more than reasonable.

You truly can't beat their meat...I tried it wasn't pretty.   Amazing...Amazing...Amazing meat selection. You can special order things like aligator, lion, javelina, probably dinosaur meat if it came right down to it.  They also have sides and sauces like woah...but what I really want to talk about is....their weekend BBQ.  Saturdays they have burgers, and chicken, and I think ribs. I always get the burger. Admittedly it has been to long since I have been working weekends and no longer right across the street but dear lord is the burger a masterpiece,  and super fair priced. they cook it up to order with a drink and fries and do it yourself condiments.   I took my girlfriend there on one of our first dates ( I know I am a real romancer) and frankly the super drippy delicousness makes for a good icebreaker and how one handles it is a true marker of character.  If I could eat any one burger right this very moment it would be that one. The only down side is that they only do it saturdays and only through lunch. It is a magic burger window everyone should make...oh and if you order some lion meat let me know...

Approximately three hours until the ripe old age of 27 hits me, after a long day of moving, we find ourselves in the Rogue. I am with the lovely Amber hoping to hell her plethora of visible tattoos will make it acceptable for me to be here by proxy. If not my cap proclaiming "I am the Boss" certainly did the trick.  Being a divier place I decided to be one of the guys and have a Bud Light like the good old days (I don't remember it being that gross before). The bartender tells me I have to put my shirt inside out if I am going to drink Bud Light. I look down and realize that I am wearing my Guinness shirt from the OYE at Finnegan's. Embarrassing but the guy gets cool points for the comment. Afterward I switch to a safe Jack and Coke...and another and another etc.  The jukebox kicks some major ass here. Plenty of punk rock, rockabilly, old soul that sort of thing.   The Kevmo met up with us pulling into a front spot in his Subaru wagon and as he clicked the lock the beep drew some stares. Nice Grateful Dead shirt hippie.   The band that was supposed to play never showed (probably syphillus complications?) so they had a replacement band show up about 11.   Bomb Threat...yup that's the name of the band. They sound about like you would expect...screaming hard terrible wanna be punk rock.    At 12:01 I decided that my first act as a 27 year old should probably be to throw some elbows in the mosh pit of a Bomb Threat show. I ended up covered in PBR as some guy who knew all the words to the songs decided to spray the shit all over the place. It was so ridiculously bad that it was fun.  In general I would advise avoiding bands playing here unless you have shitty taste in music, but otherwise this is a great spot.  P.S. I think I am going to create a Rogue Bingo game. Items to check off: -Mohawk over 9 inches -Tiger Army apparel -Crimped hair -Misspelled tattoo -Person carrying more than three cans of PBR -Cardigan sweater -Tight girl pants on a guy etc.

This place redeemed my love of servers last night (read Lola Tapas review).   The service was amazing. Our server was attentive, sweet and is the only man to ever call me buddy constantly without it being annoying. Oh did I mention his lovely singing voice? He was having a good time.  Anyone who knows me knows that I love me some gyro and their food was delicious. The tsaziki sauce is flavorful and dilly, the gyro meat tender and the hummus was perfect.  The atmosphere is cute, big anough to feel roomy, small enough for cozy. I will definately return here!

"It's a toy store for grown-ups"  *eyebrows raise*  "No no no not like that!"  When I was a kid I would get my allowance weekly and promptly get my mom to take me to the store to pick the new troll doll err...I mean troll action figure I would buy with it. Don't look at me like that! I mostly got the terminator and ninja turtle ones..sigh...oh but I digress.   Red Hot Robot is full of..well Red Hot Robots. Vinyl; it's not just for records anymore. The hippest little world of geeky toys...or is it geeky world of hip toys? Either way this place will have your inner child poking it's head out of your belly button and your cube mate rage with jealousy that you have the cooledt desk toys in all the land...yup my vinyl bunny-robot-skull mask will totally kick your star wars action figures plastic asses back to Tatooine you mama's basement living, wookie sucking douche.  Ahem...but I digress again. Get back that excitement of buying a new toy with your allowance and be the Joneses of the cubicle farm.

Seriously, how did the negative reviews come to be? My only experience with Sprinkles is based on 4 day old red velvets from the fridge at work and my holy god they were scrumtious. The flavor was rich and yummy and the frosting was divine! I almost couldn't eat a second one due to the richness...almost.

This is the number one hangover breakfast joint of all time.  Breakfast's are huge and delicious, just like mama would have used to make, if mama were one of those mamas, that used to make such meals.   Mike and Rhonda have the sort of joint that my grandfather loves. He doesn't drink, but for some reason he eats nothing but excellent hang-over food. Sometimes I go there sober with him.  The biscuits and gravy are possibly the best I have ever had, though addmittedly this is only because the biscuits are so amazing they carry the mediocre gravy.  The service is fast and efficient. I have never had to hold my aching, drowsy, hung-over head up long before the food arrived, and the giant drink glasses are perfect for re-hydrating.

He confidently pushed the menu to the edge of the table with a hand calloused, wrinkled and bent by time and years of hard work fixing cars and pushing brooms. "I don't need the menu. I have been coming here for 30 years and they have the best chicken fried steak I have had in my life."  "Hey, I know better than to doubt you, grandpa." replied the young man with the same face, minus 40 years and 30 lbs but with the benefit of an extra 4 inches in height.  The old man ordered a lemonade to wash it down and the kid took a sweet tea, both ariving in giant plastic cups that reminded the kid, now nearly 30 of his childhood summers spent with his family in El Paso,Texas with his father's family who had moved with the army from Mississippi many years before he was born but brought the traditions of cooking for taste and comfort and damned be anyone for telling them it wasn't healthy.  They sat quietly, tired from a morning of moving furniture into the young man's new home, reading the signatures on the wall. The old man pointed out and explained who some of the old-timers were, mostly polititians and actors who, while big in their day, were not legendary enough to cary into the vernacular of pop culture 30 years later, and the young man pointing out and explaining the athletes and musicians of his era.  The waiter dropped off their chicken fried steaks along with their sides: Red beans, rice with gravy, greens and potatoes. They grinned in acknowledement of having made the right choices and began to eat.  "You know, her son opened a chicken and waffle place not too far from here." ther kid said, "but you are right; this place is better. Thanks for your help today grandpa."

Found this place next door to my favorite coffee joint; copper star. I walked in not really expecting much, but sometimes love is like belly button lint...it just shows up out of nowhere; unexpected; and I fell in love with Revolver records.  I love vinyl and this place has an amazing selection as well as fair prices and an overall hip atmosphere. A Dylan record played when I walked in and after that Donovan setting the perfect mood as I shopped through all the records I could ever hope to shop through, looked over t-shirts (unexpectedly, genuinely hip compared to those i have seen in what i origionally thought to be similar stores in the past), and picked out a few buttons to make myself feel in full force awesomeness like I was in high school. I also picked out an independantly produced DVD of some local bands that I am excited to check out.   All in all this is my happy place. Damn the man. Save the empire.

Whatever this place is currently called it kicks some major ass. I was rocking what we in the nerd world like to call "The Gaiman Fro" a la Neil Gaiman. Turns out that is not the most attractive look on just anyone so I decided it was time to get it cut.  The girl who generally cuts my hair is out om maternity leave. Effing twins are making my hair bad so I decided to give someone else a shot. I am afraid to try new people as I have curly hair that is thin despite there being lots of it and my head is lopsided and I can't grow the top inch of my sideburns.  My regular girl knows how to combat all of this. It turns out Chris at Hair Pollution has "The Gift". He gave me input and let me work with the length that I had been working on but make it not look like a sloppy mess of ick.  My hair doesn't even look shorter just better! Chris rocks!

Ginger Luke recently gave me the best haircut of my life. I'm being serious. I walked in and I said, "Ginger Luke, make me look like James Dean, or at least Brandon from 90210. I don't have the easiest hair (or head shape) to work with but Ginger NAILED it.   I was getting compliments everywhere I went. Even my boss gave me the old, "I don't usually compliment men's hair, but your new haircut is very...GQ."  I might have accidentally had to tell the guy that has cut my hair in the past that he is my second favourite stylist in town.  I KNOW this sounds like one of those reviews written by someone who works at the salon but I don't. Look at my profile. I used to have clout around here. I used to be Nathan "Bear Hands 'Motherfuckin'" S.   Great stylists, trendy digs, sweet-ass old school rap jams. Who could ask for more. Oh, and don't be intimidated by how cool everyone is here. They are all sweethearts.

I tried this place a few weeks back and have been meaning to get to the review.  I couldn't manage to get anyone to go out and have a few pints with me, but you know what? I have no problem drinking alone so I went anyhow.  The place is pretty large for the cozy pub feel that it has. The music was great, though I agree the soud system needs some work. It is hard to hear from the actual bar, though maybe this is on purpose.   They have a good sized patio for us smokers and you are allowed to take your drinks with you. Thank god.  They claim the only real shepphards pie in Arizona, so I had to try it and it was fantastic, though the real star was the brown bread they served with it. They bake it fresh on site and it is amazingly good.  Most of the wait staff had Irish accents. How can you not enjoy the charm in an Irishman serving you a beer. The owner was even making rounds introducing himself and he was a standup guy.  I haven't made it back yet but it is definately in the stars.

A dark night in a city that knows how to keep its secrets. But on the 12th floor of the Acme building, one man is trying to find the answers to life's persistent questions: Guy Noir, Private Eye. (THEME)   It was a night in November. November 23rd in fact. I remember the date because it was my birthday. The snow birds that had started to flock from their summer homes had long since retired for the evening and the godfearing people of Phoenix had closed shop. My two lovely companions and I were looking for a place to fill our bellies. Like moths to a flame we were attracted to a dim light coming from a dark parking lot. We exited the car.  "Are you going to Mama Mia's?"  A beautiful petite girl with the kind of body men write home about stepped out of the shadows. I was going wherever she took me.  We were led through the kind of kitchen you only see in mob movies. I wasn't going to ask what they put in the sausage.  We stepped in and figured out our toppings. Trying to figure out toppings for one pizza between three people you may as well be figuring out cold fusion with a box of toothpicks and some masking tape. But with the plethora of options I felt like I had a bag of bananas in a monkey whore house and we narrowed it to basil and fresh tomato.  The pizza was exactly what a tired and famished private eye like myself needed on a night like this.  Man working  register- "Is that a wig?"  Jetta-" Yeah its a wig."  We left the pizza joint as happy as a twister in a trailer park.  Jetta- "I am so getting a weave."   (THEME MUSIC)   A dark night in the city that knows how to keep its secrets, but a light shines on the 12th floor of the Acme Building -- Guy Noir, Private Eye?. (THEME UP AND OUT)

My family has a motto: "Pot just makes me tired and hungry; and I'm already tired and hungry." For some of the family this means "Say no to drugs"; for others it means harder stuff is where it's at; for me it means "I need a burger and a nap."  Cue the hippies.   Two Hippies served me up a real burger. Like a REAL one! you know curvy like I like em; not flat.   The fries came in a paper bag so that no one can claim they had no idea it was bad for them and sue. The bad is clear by the time you take a seat...grease may be my favourite food  I am not going to be the only one not to mention that you get a burger, fries and can of soda (pop for Thomas S and the people of his homeland and surrounding areas--ps they say pop because they would just say soda funny.) for $5!! Way better than fast food for cheaper.   I will now end this review because I am tired...and hungry...

Whenever I am craving something delicious and healthy I head to Stir Fry Paradise and inevitably eat too many of those chinese donut hole things and load up my stirfry with thick carby noodles (hey, you never know when I might have to run a marathon)  This place is affordable like woah and delicious. It is the only do it yourself stirfry place that I have ever been and it may be the only I will need. They sell beer! Nuff said?  No. The donut holes as I stated...amazing and the other buffet style non-stirfry items are equally tasty; be it the egg rolls or soups or...JELLO!  The staff is super friendly and always remember us and greet us with a warm welcoming smile.   Also they are always just busy enough...never crowded never empty.  **not much on the atmosphere by the way. Just strip mall average, but I love this place anyhow.

A family friend died and for his funeral he wanted to have a killer party that his grandkids would have good memories of. (yes they played Freebird at the funeral)   At the party they had bounces, tents and delicious BBQ.  Waldo's catered all the way from Mesa to Avondale.   The guy serving up the food was extremely concerned that we like the food and try as much as possible. He had nothing to worry about. The pork sammich I had was wonderful...the bun was plain and store bought but it really complimented the perfectly cooked pork and the sauce..yes the sauce...Anyone who has read a few of my previous reviews knows that I love my sauces and would eat nearly anything drizzled in the right sauce.   This BBQ Sauce was not spicy like I usually like but it was not overly sweet like I don't. It had just this perfectly lightly sweet tang to it that I can still taste in my mouth. I would eat Dave B.'s Hatrid of myspace if it were covered int he sauce.  The beans were also tasty with plenty of bacon and pork flavor, and the potato salad is the only besides my grandmother's that I have really really enjoyed...Delicious hommade taste to everything!  I think Ed would have been happy with the celebration.

Getting to hang with Amy and Sarabear definately pushed the joys of this event up, but it was stand alone a great place to be.   The stage outside Grinders was pure fun. I also preffered the blues band and have to wonder along with Amy what is up with the belly dancers? I have seen more this weekend than my whole life put together beforhand.  The stands were mostly good and as I am strapped for cash but really need some art I took many cards from many talented artists...Also I want a sock zombie in a bad way.  I can't wait to see the growth here as a few more artists representing is all this place really needs....well that and a beer garden.

They are owned by McDonalds*. Anyone of the Yelp persuasion would have to want to hate them for this; but can they? I can not.  I would like my apartment to look exactly like a Chipotle with a big comfy couch. The decorating is just industrial, modern, hip. The jazz and blues piping in over the brished metal just makes me want to hang out all day; as does a stomach full of huge burrito.  The burritos are huge and delicious. I go barbacoa every time...Choice of beans? I like my beans like I like my women...Pinto. I actually get black and they rarely laugh at this joke.  Everything tastes freshly made. I even love the chips and guac. What do they do to those chips to make them so delightful? The savior of fast food joints at last!   *I was just informed that they are no longer owned by McDonalds.

There it was; cornered with the ratty Circle K that obviously needs the armed gaurd outside. Their sign in comparison was claaaassssy. Once inside you realize this is going to go one of two ways, and obviously based on all previous reviews it went the right way.  Our server had classically italian shoes, and Anthony Bourdain hair. Mixed with his jovial european attitude and accent, he was perfectly cool as all get out.  I felt like Tony Soprano, if The Sopranos was written by Kevin Smith and the mobsters discussed comic books with their generally bandanad currently little black dressed friend Amanda B.  The atmosphere is quaint and the food would help you get over the death of your italian grandmother. The pizza is divine, The imperfect look of the lasagna says this is going to be better than making out with the head cheerleader behind the bleachers in high school (I assume. I talk about comic books so this has never happened to me).  The raw beef whatcha call it, while not for everyone, is it for me. Perfectly lemony, perfectly fresh, perfectly refreshing and tasty.   The table behind us had brought their own wine, which I will certainly do next time and assume that if there is a corking fee it is resonable.  Speaking of reasonable, the prices were incredibly low for the quality of the food. Must have something to do with the heavily gaurded circle k next door.

You know what? I watched the Pound Puppies too. I had dreams of rescuing one of those little Hogan's Heroes clones from their little prison, but in real life that isn't necessarily the best way to go.  Cooler never got parvo.  There is a lot of tramatic backstory to my dog ownership that i will spare you but lets say I have been scarred and it took a lot for me to agree to go here to even look.  Several kennels were full of dog shit...haha yeah dogs live there, no sick looking dogs laying in puddles of runny wrong coloured dog shit, it kennels with healthier looking dogs rolling around in the same sick shit. Yes I am being intentionally vile with my language to make the poit of how vile it was. SHIT!  We saw a dog that we loved. I said no; she said please...then a woman told us this dog was on "the list" yup his last day on god's green earth if he didn't get adopted so we took him. A day or so after we pick him up his little cough is turning into a scary and serious sounding wheez so we take him to the vet, over a thousand dollars later we are told the dog has both pnemonia and parvo...surprise surprise since we picked hi up he had dried SHIT in his fur (keep in mind he was not to be bathed for two weeks because of having just been neutered, yes a freshly operated on dog with dried shit in his fur)  Oh and puppies don't really recover from that sort of thing so w paid the very nice vet to kill out dog...euthenasia...super....  As she bawls her eyes out I man up to call and let the MCACC know hoping they can take some preventative measures, ya know like not let other dogs roll in the shit that he left. (Parvo is super contagious). They let us know the only action they would take was to make note in our file so that if we went to adopt again they would know we didn't already have a dog in the household...yup...My next dog will be adopted from a much more responsible shelter. I understand low budgets and whatnot but how much does it cost to hose runny shit out of a kennel? GRRR.

Oh...Ooooh...Oooh my god! ...Yes! Yes! ...Oh erm...hi..ahem...didn't see you there...I was just enjoying some Sweet Sweet love..er I mean Sweet Republic... Oh who am I kidding?! Sweet Republic and I are having a naughty naughty affair!  Sinfully delicious ice creams that make you feel a little dirty to tell people about...and you almost don't want to because they might eat up the limited flavours before you get there...but it is so goddamned good that you have to brag...so you do it anyhow...and people look at you funny because you are drooling a little..and you moan a tad between flavour descriptions...so they look at you funny!...until they try it because then they know!

We were tossed to the sharks for the one year anniversary event of Babloo's. There were were...mere Yelpers surrounded by the big dogs..the kids who get paid for the game...folks from the professionally published local rags. They were taking notes, smelling their wine milling over what they would write...hey wait..the only difference was I forgot my pen and we do it for free! We Yelpers do it for the love! Put me in coach. I'm ready to play.  We opened the night with mojitos that were as lovely as anything i have ever had to drink.Minty...but not too much with just the right amount of sweet.  Moving through courses paired perfectly with wines. Even the one wine that I didn't care for on it's own once used as a compliment to the course was very palatable.   The food was delicious. Latin flair modern yet traditional. Mint used perfectly throughout. I was particularly fond of the green sauce, and the stuffed tomato was the perfect burst of flavor. And the beef dish was so perfectly prepared....mmm...  The band was a perfect mood setter...and Zoe the singer,,if you read this consider it my proposal. Wow.  I have a new favorite food. The cake! i am a bad latino...the dulce something or another...ZOMG! I felt slightly inappropriate eating it in public. If Zoe says no to my proposal I will gladly wed the dessert. Not to mention the amazing 40 yr aged rum they served to sip with it.  They also sell cigars hand rolled by a true craftsman who was there showing the great care he put into the lovely smokes of which I took two home.  I also want to give a special shout out to all of my fellow Yelpers who were there, especially Wes and Tera for the ride and company perfectly paired with a great meal and evening.

Oh man this place is awesome!! I walked out with a very heavy box of booze for $85.  Bleu cheese stuffed olives, Gibson onions, Stoli, giant bottle of Bombay Sapphire, Vermouth, six-pack of Stella, Three Philosophers beer, cheap shiraz.   Wal-Mart is to white-trash as Bevmo is to Nathan "Bear Hands" S.  The staff was super helpful-friendly. The girl at the counter even gave me an extra $10 discount. Jesi thinks it is because I signed up for their discount card; I think it is because I am super cute. Either way, if anyone wants to know where to Christmas shop for me...

I volunteered myself to help the new boss from Dallas move his mattresses from storage to his new home by buying a truck 4 years ago. FNG.  I had put in a few hours at work, and started to get that grumpiness that can only mean that it is time for a bite. You see without food the grumpiness evolves into rash hostility and I decided it was far too soon to pummel my new boss with his own queen sized pillow top mattress.  I decided to finally try Z-Pizza as it is right down the street. I ordered a slice, a salad and a soda, while chuckling at the aliteration.  The girl working the counter had that first job perkiness to her which was enjoyable. She really seemed to hope that I enjoyed my first trip.  The pizza was tasty, thin crust healthyish style. I was a little sad that I had to wait for my salad while I had my pizza, because I planned to eat the salad first making sure the last taste I left with was delicious pizza, but as it turned out the pear and garganzola salad was the highlight of the meal. The walnuts were not over candied, the pears were fresh and ripe, it was perfect for taking away the grumps.  I did not throw mattresses.

Ok..I told Amanda that anyplace that serves beer would have a tough time getting less than 2 stars from me...I wish there were 1.5 however.   As covered by Amanda this bar is about as straight as they come..this bar personified would probably call bars with any hippness at all the bad F word for gay folk. In fact this bar would most certainly over-use that word.   Does Puddle of Mudd, Disturbed and POD know that their songs are available in karaoke form? Do they make money from them? Who was the first person to say damn man I can not wait to scream this song to the MIDI music only version over some beers this weekend.  I had a good time...but I tend to make the best of things. There was far more facial hair than head hair. I hate phonetic spellings.. Oh lord don't ever make me go back.  ...eff it...I changed my mind. 1.2 stars and I am rounding down.

Everyone knows what Denny's is and Denny's is no 4 star establishment; however this Denny's gets 4 stars for a Denny's.  We stumbled in most of us drunk and obnoxious. We were seated quickly by the funniest hostess ever to work at a Denny's. She began telling us jokes that you can read in the other reviews. I mentioned we needed six jokes hoping we would each have one for our reviews.   "Sex jokes or six jokes?" She asked. "Six jokes." "Sex jokes?" Six jokes...S-I-X." "You don't spell sex with an I....must have been awhile eh sweetie?"  Keep in mind this lady has to be around her 60s.  The service was enough to boost this place up but on top of it I was introduced to their buffalo chicken sandwich..and it is good. Seriously I swear.   It is still a Denny's though.

For the love of god, would someone open a Berto's of some kind downtown? I will literally give you a million dollars. I will do it $6 at a time in exchange for delicious carnitas burritos and so will thousands of others.  El Portal was sortof el crappy. The service was lackluster and the food meh.  "I think we are out of carne asada. Yeah we are out of carne asada."  How does that happen? Then the green chili was sortof a greenish mush of blahness and no one trained them to wrap a burrito.  I also got a quesadilla which promptly leaked yellow tinged grease onto my pants from boring yellow cheese in a boring tortilla.   I also hate a tip line on a receipt from a place where you order your food at the counter and pick it up at the counter and fill your own drinks.   And why did everyone else have real plates while mine was a Dixie?  Subway is next door.

I don't know if you've noticed how great my hair is....JayKay, y'all I totally know you've noticed. Maybe you've heard me talk about Ginger: Patron Saint of the Shears, Goddess of Tresses, Blowdrying Badass, Tamer of Cowlicks, My Mane Squeeze. Best stylist I have ever had hands down and she works at Salon 7 now. Salon 7 is cute as hell too. There's a Vespa in the window. I mean it when I say "go see Ginger." She takes her time, goes over what works and doesn't, explains styling methods and options all while being entertaining as shit and hot like an oven. Your hair... it's ok... but Ginger will make you FABULOUS.

Let us begin by dissecting the word "yogurt".   Yo - traditional urban greeting, often accompanied by a high five or complicated handshake.  Gu - short name for the Chinese bangu or "flowerpot" drum  RT - abbreviation for Re-Tweet: the act of posting on Twitter what another already has, usually as a sign of approval.  Therefor, the word loosely means: Hello, bangin' stuff of which I approve.  In a world where "FroYo" has become a trend, Mojo does it right. The yogurt is delicious and the flavours are swapped out often so you never get bored. The toppings are fresh and yummy.  The staff is great.  Where they really hit the spot though, is  their customer service/marketing/social media.  Follow @mojoyogurt on twitter and you will get a link to the password for half priced treats on Tuesday. You will also get interaction. I actually received gift certs for interacting and giving feedback from my experiences and...and...they directly addressed my marshmallow cream issue. Seriously no one does it better.

I like to bring red heads here. I don't know why it works out this way it just does. I think red heads really suit The Parlor. Alright, alright, alright.  The actual restaurant is pretty awesome. Brick and wood and overall hipness. Great place to impress a date or just have a bite with a friend (I have done both I know.)  The food is super good. I have been a Harley's fan for awhile but have to admit this place picks up the red sauce slack. The food has always been fresh with the right amount of parsley for that fresh taste. The pizza isn't the best in town but it would make the top 10 list. They make the pasta themselves and it is delicious. Even the sea food pasta (I don't speak Italian but whatever it was called) was awesome and we are in a land-locked state. The salads are pretty amazing as well.  *****LISTEN UP OWNERS***** I am actually giving The Parlor 5-stars but holding one hostage. Why would you take the mushroom risotto out for a sweet corn one?! I haven't tried the corn yet and I am sure it is super fantastic but Virgin Mary mother of god , the mushroom one was soooo good. If you ever want to see your beloved 5th star from me you will bring it back. This is no joke. If I do not hear back in 5 days I will begin mailing you pieces of the star, but it will not end up on this review. Do it! Do it now!

Many people claim coffee inspires them, but, as everybody knows, coffee only makes boring people even more boring.  - Honore de Balzac "Treatise on Modern Stimulants"  Good thing I'm not goddamned boring isn't it? Are you? I didn't think so. So let's get some coffee.   Dutch Brothers only has a drive through; and as it happens, I do not drive, but my special lady friend does, so this makes a great little "we are late, but if I don't get coffee now someone's face will be murdered soon" sort of joint.  The coffee aint bad. Is it Cartel? Is it Lola? Is it Lux? Where else are the kids getting their coffee these days? No it is none of those. It only has a drive through remember? What the hell do you expect? Ya know what though? It truly aint bad. I like it and I drink it black. I do not find it to taste watered down like a lot of people have said and I hold to the last step of a recipe for coffee that I heard somewhere: "if the horseshoe sinks drink it".   The people who work here are on drugs. I mean like in a metaphorical way of course; not in a slander sort of way. They are perky and friendly as shit. Admittedly, there is an irony in the fact that some mornings you just can't handle that level of friendliness before your coffee.   My dog goddamn loves it here though. The pretty, little, young girls go ape-shit over him and give him dog biscuits and pats on the head and kisses right on his wet dog nose. At no other drive through will he go as tongue-hanging, tail-wagging crazy, trying to get into the drive through window to love up on those PYTs.  Anyone that is cool to my dog is cool with me.  On rare occasion when I feel no need whatsoever to prove how manly I am by ordering my coffee like I like my women: strong and black; I will order their sweet drinks. Oh man....This is their specialty for sure. Willy Wonka wakes up with this stuff.  They do it right. They do it quick. Perfect on the go cup o joe. (Goddamn I should write t shirt slogans.)

Who can take a sunrise Sprinkle it in dew Cover it in chocolate  and a miracle or two?  Smeeks!  Let me get this out of the way. There are two things that Smeeks is missing: A bike rack and Sammy Davis Jr.  The first should really be unforgiveable, especially for a hipster, indie, shopping mecca such as this corner is, but I will distribute blame to all of the shops and take in to consideration that they let me park my bike inside for a recent writing workshop I attended there and let it slide this once. As for item number two...well since he died of throat cancer in 1990 we will let that one go as well.  I went for a writing workshop after hours, last night. The workshop was based on writing about memories and they had a table loaded with chocolates, gummies, malt balls, candy cigarettes, button candy, any kind of treat to spur sweet memories so I had a chance to sample a wide variety of goods.  I have also been in to Smeeks several times on my own so this review is by no means based solely on a candy catered, one-night, sugar-rush.  Smeeks is adorable, it's charming, it's old-school but not geriatric. If personified it would be that fun yet classy older lady who you are surprised to find yourself fantasizing about.  My sweet tooth took over last night; it became Hyde to my dieting Jekyll, but "He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man." so I gave in to temptation. I let my fingers gently grip ball after ball of smooth, thick chocolate covering the light crunch of malt. I tongued the candy cigarettes and let one dangle from my mouth doing my best James Dean pout. I sucked the chocolate from chocolate covered marshmallows followed by the sensation of the sugary delight disolving in my mouth. I was a kid in a candy store.  Smeeks is full of the hard to find. Each member of the group last night and each person i have ever entered the store with has found a candy that made them light up with recognition as they  rattled on about whatever childhood memory it had spurred, despite the fact I have never heard of most of them.  Let us not forget the novelties. Small toys, trinkets and a wall of bacon products. Not flavored, more of a wall for the worshipers of bacon. i wallet made to look like it is made from bacon, bacon magnets, notepads, bacon everything.  Based on early reviews it sounds like Smeeks got a rough start, but as Yelpers we have to love a place that does it right; a place that takes the issues of the people and listens then in turn improving until they are the 5 star establishment that they are today.

When I wa staying in the 702, I would drink glass after glass of Wild Turkey, then stumble my way out the door with a to-go cup to this place.   This is the kind of bar with a family feel, a drunk hip family feel. Evey seems to be in the same clique and though even after frequent visits I was rarely reccognized, I also always felt welcome and like part of ths "in-crowd."  They have an amazing selection of beers which is just the right thing to come down off of Wild Turkey with so I never did make it to the whiskey attic though I hear great things.

My home away from home.   I write some keyword blogs for a living so I need someplace to work. I go here and try to look like I am working on a script instead because the hipster girls like that.  The baristas are all lovely ladies (Except Joreal [sp?] but he is cool as shit so I let it slide).  The coffee is divine. The place is hip and you will run in to myself and/or Wayne almost daily and that's cool right?

When I was in grade school, my best friend lived next door. We would do everything together but then one day my best friend moved away. A new family moved in with another kid my age. I effing hated that kid. He had a stupid name and a stupid face and he lived in my friend's house! How dare he?!  Over time, once I gave him a chance it turned out the new kid wasn't so bad. We even became friends and he played a mean second base at kickball.  "The Main Ingredient? Seriously? That is a tragically terrible name." Is a direct quote from somewhere in the middle of a conversation I had with my good friend Julia T about the new establishment in the old Lisa G's location. Then after arriving: "Julia, they serve sandwiches and salads. Nothing here even has a goddamned main ingredient."  But ya know what? The new kid aint so bad! My sandwich (the calvano) seriously good,like SERIOUSLY, and remember I didn't want to like it at all. I also had a bite of the tuna melt and it was awesome as well.   One thing I will bring up is that the booze selection leaves a bit to be desired. Crown and JD are the only two whiskey's. Seriously, new friend, fix this or I am going to be forced to make fun of you with the other kids behind your back.

My dog is cuter than your dog. Seriously, there is no argument you can make to the contrary. He is simply the cutest dog in existence. Because of this, Buckley deserves the very best, so I constantly have my eye out for new shops to spoil him at. Today I came across Petique while waiting for my computer at the Apple store.  The deal is, The Biltmore donated the shop space to the Humane society.  The Humane Society in turn created a really cute little retail shop and adoption center.   If you have a small dog whom you enjoy carting around please check out the carriers here. They are some of the coolest I have seen in awhile (especially the sugar skull decorated one).   I picked up a toy, some treats and poopy bags. The poopy bads are especially of note as they are decorated in a skull and cross bone pattern to let others know "Don't eff with me while I am cleaning up my dog's poo".  They also had three or four dogs and a wall full of cats for adoption. The people were knowledgeable on the behavior of the dogs and when I inquired were able to tell me which they felt would and wouldn't be a good fit for the person I was inquiring for.   They do not have the biggest selection of products but what they do have is great and TAX FREE. Yup non-profits can do that. I'll be back to treat my pound puppy quite a bit I'd imagine.

I'm not really a hot dog guy (not that there's anything wrong with that). When I crave a hot dog, I might get one and one is always necessary at a ball game and once in awhile i will get a hot dog at the gas station when in a pinch, but in general, I am not the sort of guy to go out of my way to find a wiener.  That being said...The first time I went to Short Leash at the Public Market with Ayesha S. It was damned good but ya know...still a hotdog, not my thing necessarily. Second time I went was with Julia T. and I think "yeah I kinda get it, if you are into hot dogs..." Third time...something just opened inside of me...something magical and warm and I felt like Belle in Beauty and the Beast, my heart opening up and for the  first time not viewing it just as a hot dog (There must be something there that wasn't there before) but as a sandwich, a meal, a real step above what I am used to in the hot dog department.  The actual hotdog...it is...How do i put it?...the texture and flavour are like BAM. Then the toppings...pick your own or go with one of the choice combinations they list...also they run specials with pet dog namesakes. You probably aren't going to get it wrong no matter what you go with.  The toppings are fresh, tasty and they are not stingy with em. It all gets loaded up into a flatbread which sounds odd but works.  Here is the real kicker...these people are effing rad. I walk up and guy says to me "I'm sorry, I forgot your name." I had been there twice and not that recently I didn't even expect him to remember who I was at all.   So then I go pay with my card and realize I forgot to get a bottle of water for my dog. The guy gives me a bowl of water for him and then the lady behind the counter asks if he can have a hotdog. She even assures me they are 100 percent beef. Gives my dog a free hot dog! Mind you I think they appreciated the work he was doing gathering signatures for the DT dog park. *ching* I felt tingly all over and knew it was true love.   Cray good. CRAZY good.
