Tried the breakfast for the first time at this place... the girls making the food kept asking questions like they didn't know their own menu.  I ordered the Country Grilled Burrito.  I got a sausage egg and cheese burrito.  I ordered the jalepeno honey chicken biscuit.  The chicken was rubbery, and the honey was ice cold from the refrigerator in a cup in my bag.  Very disappointed.

I had lunch here yesterday. It was pretty good! The fish was tasty and it was a nice atmosphere. Looks like a nice place to go with a group to watch a game and have some drinks too!  I didn't have sashimi on this trip but I will be back to try!

Terrible service. I've given them multiple chances knowing the brand and liking them before. Unprofessional people work there. Shift leader/supervisor hung up on me when I called about a total rip off incorrect, cold, greasy, disgusting order.   Disappointed.
