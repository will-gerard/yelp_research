Bad food and terrible service.  Went here during restaurant week with a large group of friends and everyone was disappointed.  The service was slow and disrespectful and I'm not sure I would have fed my rubber steak to the dog.  I'm not one to go out of my way to write a bad review unless the place really deserves it, and sadly this "steakhouse" certainly does due to the quality of food, price and service. Don't do it, try City Hall.

Busy, cool little place here. Cozy decor and atmosphere with a European feel, great place to share a bottle of wine and sample some of the many bruschettas.  Food is great here but menu is short and  would appreciate some options with a bit more substance.  Prices are good and Hoegaarden on tap is superb.  No reservations here so arrive early.

Fresh toasted subs from the heavens, a fresh alternate to all those bland commercial sub shops.   Good food and friendly service is what you will find here.  Afgani sandwich is hard to beat, but everything is good.  Not to mention they have kool-aid on tap.  Originality and flavor make this place a must. Cool joint.

This place has been here for decades for a reason;  good food, good service, good price.  Classic old school Chinese, family run restaurant.  Lunch specials are superb and leave little left to be desired. Winning.

A staple of Tempe, all beef char grilled dogs to their finest.  This place is classic out of Buffalo, NY.  This place has been here forever and isn't going anywhere soon.  The secret? natural skin casings.  Grab yourself a loganberry drink and an all-beef and treat yourself, you deserve it.

Can't get em' like this any more. High quality corn fed meat from the Midwest. This place has an excellent meat market, butcher, bakery, and restaurant with home style dishes,  just like grandma use to make.  Decor and style is from the 1940'-50s just like most of the customers. Did I mention they deliver and have homemade jerky. Stop by here before your next BBQ.

Best brewery in AZ by far.  Original in house micro brews and delicious upscale bar food.  This place always has about 10 brew on tap including seasonals, pumpkin porter around Halloween is epic.  Other than that the Kilt is the best.  Location is in cool old factory building but wish there was A/C in the summer only drawback here.  Good place for an intellectual conversation with one of the ASU professors.

Another staple of Tempe, Big Juan has been cooking up these char grilled burgers for some time now, it's a staple of Tempe.  Nothing fancy here, just good old American style greasy burgers.  Grab a Big Juan, Zucchini sit down play at the old school pac-man and enjoy your surroundings by ASU campus.

Very Impressive, great food, good service and incredible view.  This place sits atop the 64th floor of Mandalay Bay and is now my "go to" place in Vegas.  Had the Curry Lobster last time I was there which was delish.  If you want to impress a date or just have a good time check this place out.

Great place for lunch, transport yourself back in time to this quaint farm grill which offers high quality food, fresh ingredients, killer burgers and an atmosphere that is one of a kind.  Good place for breakfast as well.  Family owned restaurant goodness.  Only drawback is the line, however good things come to those who wait.

#1 in AZ.  Anytime I want to go out for a special occasion, no question where we are going.   Classy atmosphere, good service and the food is off the charts. Bone-in filet & lobster mash are divine.  Definitely my favorite of the Mastro's line.  This place is a keeper.

Very good small family run Thai place.  Hard to beat this place for your Thai fix.  Only drawback is that the restaurant is small so I usually get takeout, but it is nicely decorated inside. Pad Thai hot, wontons and wonton soup, hot and sour are my go to's. One of my favorites on the east side.

Another fast, efficient move by GYMO.  The guys arrived on time ready to get my move on.  When conducting business I consider "on-time" to be at least 10 minutes early, and that's exactly what these guys did.   They carefully packed a few thousand pounds of heavy furniture, and the rest of my 2 story house as if it was their own.  The move was completed quickly and to my satisfaction.  This company is all about one thing; CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Terrible service and rude customer service. I was a loyal customer to this company in the past. Due to recent interactions with a customer service manager and an overpriced contract, I have been forced to go elsewhere. I consider this company very unethical and advise you to avoid it at all cost.

Great event, good cause, good run.  Nice mini-tour through Tempe (4.2 miles) to honor Pat Tillman #42.  The run is scenic, plenty of water available and tons of sponsors giving away free stuff.  Very crowded now a days, but that is to be expected.  Pick up your tag and shirt  days before the event though to avoid the chaos.  Overall a well organized event and a well known Tempe tradition.
