First time at Athenian for lunch today.  Really liked it - mom and pop atmosphere.....great menu.....good service.  Got the steak/mushroom pita - it was REALLY good.  I'll be back and I'm looking forward to trying many more menu items.

So - started working right down the road from MOTO, and a coworker said, there's a good lunch spot down the road, we should go.  So we did.  I really, really like this place.  It's got a hip, yet laid back atmosphere, good rock music playing, and very genuine and friendly staff.    Food - I've had sushi here a few times, and it was "good".  About 7.5/10 on my sushi scale.  But let's talk about their build to order rice bowls.  You can mix and match a myriad of meats and vegetables and choose your temperature level.  I told my server a few visits ago that I really like hot, spicy food, and she recommended the "Exit Wound" bowl.  The name alone is super cool.  This selection immediately became my favorite lunch dish that I've had in ages.  Quite spicy, but not over the top....and amazing flavor sauteed into the breaded shrimp, chicken and fresh vegetables, all over white or brown rice.  (brown for me)  Did I mention that the owner of this place is a beer snob?  There are always several outstanding craft brews on tap here - and they go SO well with some of the spicier dishes.  I would come to MOTO just for the beer selections, but the food is also good enough to get me back in there as well.  I now visit Moto at least once a week for lunch, and they haven't let me down yet.  Love this joint - 5 stars - and get the Exit Wound bowl!!

Love this place.  I hit it about once a month to avoid giving all my hard earned $$ to big shops like Bass Pro, etc.  There's plenty of high end gear, and a pretty good selection of terminal and soft baits.  The best thing about this shop is the old school vibe.  There are usually a few older guys sitting up front, (not employees) reading newspapers, talking trash, etc.  Kind of a barber shop deal.  Also, if you want some help, and an almost guaranteed laugh, ask Jeep for help.  The dude totally knows his fishing, and he's got a wry sense of humor, which he never fails to break out on me.  Also, when he's ringing up my items, he nonchalantly knocks 10-15% off of everything I'm buying, which doesn't suck at all.  Great local business, great people, totally legit.  Can't believe there aren't more reviews on here.  5 stars.  Time to go fishing now....

To the girl with the bracelet story - really sorry to hear about that and I would be furious as well if that happened to me.  Not going to downplay that situation....  To the guy complaining about the beer not being in coolers.  Two things.  One - there's a ton of craft beer back in the coolers.  It's not all on the front shelves.  Two - just about every amazing beer selection I've ever seen has been on regular store shelves, not in coolers.  Many of the beers available there are in fact actually brewed to be consumed at room temperature.  Anyway - I freakin' LOVE.  THIS.  PLACE.  Nothing better than a somewhat dirty, old schoolish liquor store right in the heart of "conservative central"....Gilbert.  Close enough for me to ride my bike, and the best craft beer selection short of Total Wine or Bevmo.....but it's growing all the time!!  Also a great selection of high end liquor and quite a bit of wine.  I talk to the owner every time I go in there, and he's always ready to show me the latest and greatest additions to the beer selection, even pulling "special" stuff out of the stock room for me at times.

Friggin epic sandwiches.  Pretty busy - parking is a pain.  The sandwiches are AMAZING though.  Don't be in a hurry here - takes a good 10-15 minutes to get your order.  I don't care - it rules.

Went to Kokopelli for the first time on Sat., 3/20/10.  We had a large party and no reservation, but the hostess assured us that they could accomodate us.  We were seated in about 15 minutes - good to go.  Wine:  We ordered a bottle of Kokopelli's cab - and it was exactly what I was looking for - BIG, complex, etc.  Not an AMAZING wine, but very good.  (can't remember the name of it....darn.)  Food:  I ordered a pork dish, that was served in medallions with some insanely good mashed potatoes and a great chipoltle sauce on the side.  I also tasted a pasta/chicken dish and a blackened salmon w/ crab meat dish from my fellow diners.  All were quite good.  Service:  The service was very good - especially considering how busy they were on Saturday night.  Other:  They had a live jazz duo playing (guitar and double bass) and they were fantastic.  They were playing a great Santana jam, and they kept on inserting riffs from Metallica, and nobody even noticed.  (except me, I'm a musician, can't help it)  So - I'd go back to Kokopelli anytime.  4 stars.

Have enjoyed going to Zipp's for years.  The wings are friggin' amazing, they have some pretty nice beers on tap, and the staff is super friendly and cool to talk to.  The outdoor patio is great for large parties, love going there with a group after work to decompress and/or watch a Suns or D-Backs game.  5 Stars - All day long.

Attention, General Manager......you have a problem.  Went to lunch here for the 1st time in a while.  The buddy that I went with said "man, the last time I came here, the service was BAD."  Why I didn't heed his comment and go to any of the other 50 restaurants within a 2 mile radius, I don't know.  We walk in the front door, and there are 10+ people waiting to be seated.  No evidence of a hostess, nothing.  We stand there for maybe 5 minutes, during which time several various employees walked through the room, none of who payed any attention to the fact that there are now about 12 people waiting for any sign of life and ultimately a place to park our rear ends and get a menu.  We decided to go into the bar area, which was pretty full with the same vibe of no employees, lots of patrons, nothing happening.  By some miracle, we were finally seated by a mute hostess, and it then took about 10 minutes to hear from anyone else.  From the time we sat down until the time we left, about 1hr and 10 minutes passed.  Every step of the way was us waiting for someone to take our drink order, waiting for the drinks, (just WATER by the way.....no bartender required) waiting to order, waiting for the food, waiting for water refills, waiting for our check, waiting to wait for something else.  The food - decent, but who cares.  Not going back there anytime soon.

I made the huge mistake of ordering from the Green Burrito menu at this Carl's Jr.  I'm not picky.  I'll eat tacos from Jack in the Box.  Happily.  I ordered some kind of California Chicken Burrito, which turned out to be about a half pound of mushy refried beans, with MAYBE two ounces of rubbery, diced chicken mixed in.  Also ordered one regular taco - the meat was basically extremely greasy dog food - or at best something I'd expect out of a can of potted meat.  Asked for hot sauce....the guy said that had one kind.  It was in Carl's Jr. packets, and tasted like very slightly spicy ketchup.  No idea how the hell the Green Burrito stays in business.

Worked directly with the owners for a very small project that I was only charged $16 for....their service, attention to detail, follow-up, and attitudes were all A+++.  I'm now a customer for life and would recommend 3 monkeys services to anyone!!

I've been driving right by The Pink Spot for several months now, since I started a new job downtown.  I've been vaguely aware that it was there, but here comes the ridiculous part.    For the last week or so, they've had a pink gorilla dancing around on the sidewalk, enticing passers by to visit.  He dances like a maniac, is totally into the gig and I've been laughing every time I pass him each morning.  So, this AM, I see that pink SOB up in the distance, and I actually succumb to this ridiculous "guerrilla" marketing.  I'm glad I did.  Really cool coffee/breakfast/ice cream shop.  I got a latte, and a breakfast sandwich called a "clucker" or something like that.  Both were fantastic.  The place is nicely decorated, has free wifi, seemed clean and the hipster gal who helped me was nice.  The service wasn't super quick, and I was the only one in there, so it might get interesting if it were crowded.  Not sure.  Anyway - this is a cool little place to grab coffee/breakfast, and the rest of the reviews on here indicated that the ice cream is pretty insane.

Just-In Time Moving and Delivery -  OUTSTANDING COMPANY!!  OK....here we go.....  - Called a few days ago....Justin, the owner of the company, answered the call.  He was extremely friendly, asked all the right questions, gave me a well thought out estimate, and gave me a confident feeling from the start.  - This morning, Justin's big, clean, cool moving truck showed up at my storage unit right on time.  Three nice, well groomed, friendly crew members greeted me, and got started.  - In WAY less time than I expected....the truck showed up at my new residence with all of my junk.....er.....belongings.  - The crew began unloading.  They were extremely careful, concerned about where each and every item belonged, and as a bonus, they had a nice little comedy routine going on between the three of them throughout the entire unloading process.  They finished a good 30 minutes ahead of the time estimate that Justin originally provided to me.  I paid by credit card, gave each of the crew a cash "thank you", and off they went.  In summary - If you are looking for a moving service for your residence or business, use this company.  Period.  In a day and age where quality and customer service have basically gone down the toilet, Justin-Time Moving and Delivery is an organization that goes above and beyond in every aspect of what they do.  Five HUGE, FAT, RED STARS.

So, I just started working in old town Scottsdale, and one of my team members recommended that we have a team lunch somewhere close by in Scottsdale.  Furthermore, she recommended that we go to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, to which I replied, Hellz yes.  Never been there, but it sounded disgustingly great.  My instincts were correct.  Before I knew it, we were all staring at plates with heavily breaded, fried chicken breasts, thin, crispy waffles and nice sides of GRAVY and mac and cheese.  Sweet Jesus - this stuff was AMAZING.  The fried chicken was some of the best I've had, and the waffles, well, they were the BEST waffles I've ever had, done and done.  I ate the fried chicken and mac and cheese first, and then the waffle for dessert.  Epic, simply epic.  The only thing I didn't have that I wish I did, was a mason jar full of red Koolaid.  It would have been perfect.  I did have iced tea, which was awesome anyway.  The only drawback to lunch at Lolo's is that I'm now back at the office and experiencing a food coma that at best will negatively impact my productivity, and at worst will snatch the life out of my grease soaked carcass.  Five stars - can't wait to go there after a night of boozing.

First time at Echo today - stopped in and grabbed a Latte.  REALLY good espresso.  Nice staff.  A pretty serious crowd - almost full - and everyone either working or studying.  Super glad that everyone is hanging there, but it was a bit library like with everyone working away and virtually no conversations going on.  Anyway - great caffeine - I'll be back.

So I, like others, read the review in the AZ Republic and decided to give Holly's a shot.....I live within walking distance, so I was thrilled to hear of a new, non-chain eatery so close by.    I showed up on a Saturday morning at 8:30 AM with my 8 year old daughter.  The seating area of the restaurant looks more like a sparsely configured coffee house, with a couch and some very, very small tables scattered about randomly.   All of the tables were occupied, save one in the back.  A lady that appeared to be working there walked by (she was wearing an apron) so I asked if that table was available.  She said "I don't know" and scrambled around me to set someone's coffee down.  Meanwhile, a family walked in the door behind me, pushed past my daughter and I, and sat at the table that I've been talking about.    I went up to the counter to ask how I could find myself at a table sometime in the near future, but couldn't get anyone's attention for several minutes.  If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a lack of customer service combined with chaos.  It literally makes my blood boil.  After being in the restaurant for about 10 minutes without any interaction from an employee, I walked out the door, walked home, loaded my daughter in the car and drove to JP Pancake down the street.    Maybe I'll try Holly's again someday.....in the meantime, if anyone from Holly's reads this, please consider hiring a high school student to host/hostess / manage the front, etc.  I'm giving two stars, as I'm sure it's hard to start a restaurant, and I never actually tried the food.  Also, I'm not sure this is a good place to take kids, given the small tables, overall small space, etc.

This is really simple - start a fast, simple, healthy restaurant and provide friendly, fairly quick service - and I'm a fan for life.  I just hit Salad and Go for about the 4th time last night - drive through every time - and it's just fantastic.  Everything is super fresh, portions are good, and friendly, energetic youngsters serving the goods.  I'm sure I'll hit this place at least twice a week - it's awesome.

Finally made my way to Arizona Drum Shop, and the visit was WAY overdue.  I just needed a couple of simple hardware items, but I ended up staying and talking drums/products with Ron (the proprietor) for about an hour.  I could easily have stayed much longer.   Ron is an expert on drums and cymbals, but here's the key:  He LISTENS.  He has a super friendly, consultative approach that resulted in my getting exactly what I wanted, and tons of great information and fuel for future purchases.  It's a GREAT store, with GREAT products, and a GREAT owner/operator.  5 big stars.  Thanks Ron!!

I'm a HUGE fan of Barrio Cafe in Phoenix, and Barrio Queen did not disappoint.  Amazing flavor in my shrimp enchiladas, and the margaritas were out of this world.  The service was AMAZING as well.  The staff had a great sense of urgency and teamwork, and the manager stopped by to chat towards the end of our dinner - super nice guy and extremely concerned about our experience.  To the people whining about portion sizes, this is gourmet dining.  Plenty of restaurants within a mile that serve huge portions of traditional Mexican food.  And as for the people saying go down the street to Joyride - I'm pretty much speechless.   If that's what you're looking for, SoCal Fish Taco company blows Joyride out of the water, but neither of those places hold a candle to the fare at Barrio Queen.
