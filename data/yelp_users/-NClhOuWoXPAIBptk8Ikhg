Terrible customer service. We stayed in a non smoking room and 2nd night we started smelling cigarette smoke!! They were not trying to help the situation. Finally we spoke to the manager after we spoke to 4 people who said the manager will contact us back, however, after waiting for 30 minutes and 4 phone calls later we decided to walk down and speak to the manager. Once speaking to the manager, he was still reluctant to help us. Oh, by the way, he didn't get a message to call us back. He said I can take some fees off.... That's nice, but how about cigarette smoke? He said, "Someone who is staying above you, which is smoking floor might be a heavy smoker.... So maybe you can smell it." Really??? WTF???  Well, non smoking floor shouldn't have any cigarette smoke coming to the vent in bathroom!! They need to install a better ventilation system or whatever.  We stayed at MGM before and we really liked it so we booked a room, but one day later we found flamingo was $100 cheaper so we decided to change the reservation.......  Now we realized that changing a room for $100 just might not be worth it.......
