Who doesn't like the Beatles? And if you Love them, you will surely cream your pants during this show. What better place to do that than in Vegas?  I had never seen a Cirque performance before, so I can't comment on how this one compares to the others -- but on its own, it was quite an elaborate spectacle, infusing projected images with talented dancers, acrobats, skaters, and all sorts of props to provide creative, evocative, and sometimes provocative renditions to the Lovely songs.  We bought our tickets through the Mirage website, which provided for a 25% discount. While there is a such thing as awesome seats, there are also no bad seats per se because of all the projectile action. In fact, if you're higher up, you could get a nice glimpse of the bigger picture.  We hit up will call early, and they gave us two-for-one drink tickets for the lounge, to be patronized before the show. We were thus charmed into getting two drinks each and double-fisting during the show. Good stuff.

I liked the fab ambience that had mostly been achieved (but for the flat-screens playing sports :P), but this place disappointed in most other respects.  The $10 bottomless bubbles were some cheap variety, and the OJ used in mimosas was Sunny D or something in that league.   Then there was the food. The pumpkin french toast sounded promising, but the bread tasted stale and hadn't really absorbed much flavor, and had been topped off with canned fruit. My sister's omelette was bland and appeared to have been microwaved.  Unforch, the service didn't much compensate for the bad food or drinks either.  Nobody even came around to offer the supposed bottomless bubbles until we were done consuming whatever we could stomach.  The crowd primarily consisted of overgrown frat boys and blonde women with too much plastic surgery.    The live music was a good touch.
