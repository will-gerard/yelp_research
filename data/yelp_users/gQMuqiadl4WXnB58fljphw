Seriously the slowest experience ever! There were four of us really early...the restaurant was pretty much empty. We ordered three entrees and four desserts (It was so early that I was still full from lunch!) Anyway, they bring out our desserts first! We kinda all look at each other and the waitress takes a cue and says, oh the food isn't ready yet so I thought I would start you off with some desserts. Okay, cool, we will take it. We ate our desserts and were still waiting for our food! It was nuts. We went in for a quick bite and it took 2 hours! Haha and flagging someone to get us our check was darn near impossible. Oh and it is in a sketch part of Phx. haha!  The food: Their Tortellini Alfredo was good! I think that was my fave of the entrees brought to us. None of us tried their calzones or pizza, but we were close!  Their desserts: They only advertise one...their trifle. It is good, but not damn near as incredible as their version of the pizookie! I had a friend who wanted to make a baby with the cheesecake and their brownie with ice cream was respectable. Save room for dessert here...and just get the pizookie! Yum!

I live in Tucson and come up to Sky Harbor often to fly.  PROS:  1. There are lots of non stop flights and since it is such a big airport, I can usually get some pretty good deals on them.  2. Security is fast and easy compared to most other big airports. The staff is pretty friendly too.  3. There are many parking options around this airport.  4. There are good food options in terminal 4 where I spend a majority of my time. I really can't speak for the other terminals.  5. They have multiple cell phone lots and the traffic flow through the airport in dropping off and picking up seems to be pretty good.  6. The baggage claim is phenomenal here. They get your bags out to you super quick!   CONS:  1. Right now there are separate terminals and if you change planes here you may have to go out of security and through again to get to another terminal. They are working on this with the sky train. But to be fair, I was once here when a crazy guy came after shooting someone in the face off site with his gun. When stupid people do stuff like that, you can isolate them better and only shut down one terminal instead of them all. That helps keep the flow going! haha! So maybe it is a small pro after all?!

I don't know why people like Red Robin. First off, the service was bad. Asking for water, more fries, or to even order was like pulling teeth.  The food isn't all that great. I got a cobb salad and they forgot some of the ingredients in it when it was presented to me.  So I guess none of it was good. I'll just stop here.

Finally tried BJ's. It is one of those menus like The Cheesecake Factory. Not as bad though, but slightly long and overwhelming.   Best part was that I was finally let in on the secret of the Pizookie! YUM!!! I went with the traditional chocolate chip and was not in the least bit disappointed! I could eat those all day....  This location: busy, but service was good especially for how busy they were.   Food I tried: Avocado Egg Rolls--my favorite! So yummy! Mac and Cheese--my least favorite. Dry and tasteless. Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread--I love anything with goat cheese! Great White Pizza--not bad, not good, did the trick. Pizookie-SEE ABOVE AMAZINGNESSSSSSS

Hands down my favorite airline there is. Southwest really is doing things right. Other airlines should take note. Their airlines are clean, tickets are reasonably priced, and they have a good rewards program. I also like the open seating. But what really takes the cake for me is their staff. One trip I was flying back home after tearing my ACL skiing, the staff was attentive in making sure I had a seat next to me to prop up my leg and that I had ice for my knee. Another time flying we were late flying out due to a crazy guy in the airport terminal and when I ordered a drink, the flight attendant said it was on him. Even when I pay for my own drink, I get some pretty good pours. They truly do everything they can to make your flight enjoyable.   Southwest, you have my heart and my business.

Great place to shop! Close enough for me to make a nice trip to an upscale mall! Lots of stores and restaurants to choose from and it works!

My husband's family took us to a concert at the Jobing.com arena. We needed somewhere close to eat. All restaurants were swamped from concert goers, but when we walked up to the packed Yard House, they were very accommodating and we took their last table outside. Thankfully on a hot summer day, the misters and prompt service of water made everything okay.  While the restaurant was totally full, our waiter never seemed stressed and checked in on us often. He was very knowledgeable about all the beers and even provided our table with a sample.  I tried a happy hour martini. I would never not pay happy hour prices for their drinks. It was okay, but I think if I am ever there again, I would just get a glass of wine (since I don't drink beer)  As for the food, I chose their 4 cheese pizza which was on happy hour pricing. It was 11 inches and only 6 dollars and change! What a deal and a yummy pizza to boot! I decided to add pepperoni onto it. Each topping is 1.00. My husband and his sister had burgers which were some of the best I have tried. Be warned that their BBQ sauce is on the sweeter end, but all sauces for your burgers are on the side. Their fries are those yummy thin fries that make it easy for you to eat a lot of them. Members of our table also ordered a Cobb Salad which was good and Jambalaya. If you can't make it to New Orleans, this will do the trick!  I would have given this place a three if it wasn't for the pizza (especially with the amazing happy hour price) and the burgers. So I say come during happy hour.
