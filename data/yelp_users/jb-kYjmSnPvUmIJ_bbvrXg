So my review got deleted because I included the name of the worker, but I will write this again. I was very disappointed with the customer service I received with the lady I worked with at this location. Her initials are JP. She wasn't very friendly while working with me. I sent in all my forms and documents to her which took an entire hour out of my day for a job that pays $10 an hour. I drove an hour total through this whole process. I am 4 months here, I got lost. If you're in an extreme situation she will not help you. The building you have to go to to get your fingerprints done has so many different exits and JP told me to find visitors parking which I couldn't find because all the parking spots there are with gates. She kept repeating herself over and over again which doesn't help because I still don't know where to go. I don't think she knew either, which she could have transferred me to someone who could have helped me. Turning around in that area isn't easy it's very busy and cops everywhere. I scraped up my tire because I was trying to turn around in places that were too tight. She keeps telling me go west go east I have no clue where that is. At the end of the call she tells me "I can already tell you're not qualified for this position" are you serious?? They put me through all that crap just to tell me that! I was hurt and drove 35 min to get my finger prints done. Jobs not guaranteed until a month after you do your fingerprints. What a horrible system. I will never come here again and I'll make sure to let everyone know about how poor my experience was. So upset my car got scratched in the process of this. If you're new here don't work with JP, she won't be much help. If this gets deleted again I'll keep posting it. I won't stop. I'll call management soon to report her.

I would think twice about doing business with them. Bought the deal from Groupon for $40, and it listed everything that comes with the deal, which included an X-ray, 30min massage, spine manipulation, etc....came to the office and the doctor never told me they would charge me an additional $40 for the X-Ray. He said he was going to do the X-ray and I took all my earrings off and bra, but he never said it would cost me more. He literally cracked my neck and back in one area and his part was over. Not sure why they charge so much since the doctor spends like 5min with you and the machine does all the rest. He brought me to the receptionist who initially messed my appointment up, so the doctor had to schedule it for me. We ended up texting which already was a red flag that a doctor texts his own patience. The receptionist says it will be $40.... I was shocked and confused... Huh?   I gave her my card because I'm a nice person and didn't want to fight or ague, but I was so furious at that point that they would make me pay while I am still in treatment. I asked her what the charge is for and she said for the X-ray and I told her the doctor never told me this. By the way, the doctor was standing on the other side of the desk where I couldn't see him, but I knew he was there. She apologized to me and didn't really care, doctor didn't say a word even though I knew he heard me. He couldn't have clarified it right then and there?   I ended up walking towards the door because I was so confused on what is next. They didn't do a good job explaining what is next. This is my first time I had no idea. The list on groupon seems very long compared to the services I had which lasted less then 20 min. I went on the spine decompression which was a horrible experience. After it ended my back was hurting even more!! The massage therapist there I forgot his name saw the pain I was in and took me to his room and helped me stretch. He was very sweet in doing this and I thank him very much for going out of his way to help me! May god be with you! Thank you for that.   Unfortunately I woke up and my back was 2X worse after that experience and I called groupon to get my money back, which they apologized and refunded my money. I called the doctor and it was a complete disaster! I can't believe what a cheap doctor he is that he can't refund me my $40, which he practically stole from me! He makes so much money and $40 is too much for him to give his patient back? He tricked me, I don't know the terms he was using. I'm not a doctor. He never said it would cost me an additional $40 for the X-ray.  It wasn't on any of the papers that I signed. He lied to me. Please everyone be careful of this doctor! He will talk you into coming back for 6 weeks and discounts the price to $1,300 instead of $5,000.   This is a chiropractor!! This is not a legit doctor who can diagnose you!!! He should be ashamed to call himself a doctor. Talking to him was difficult he kept taking over me and ended up cutting the line. He can hard earned $40. He lost a patient for $40, not a very smart doctor. He could have given me my money back and I would come back periodically, but he chose to lose me as a customer completely. I will make sure to tell everyone I know about my experience. No one not even my worst enemy deserves to be treated like this. Can't stand people who think just because they have a degree they're kings or something. People are people. Once this doctor figures that out he might be able to get his business out of the hole!!   Good luck!!!!

Another horrible service by Victoria secrets I would think that going out-of-state would make the service better but no everything is officially the same, plain horrible. All I wanted to do was come in and buy a strapless bra maybe even two or three spend I don't know a hundred $200. They brought me into the dressing room and I got measured and I was told that I was a 34 double D. I have always been a B or C cup my entire life. This is the one store where they will tell you that you have bigger boobs than you really do to make yourself feel better. I was told that I was double D but if I go to another store and I look at their double D's they will fit my head! I told the lady just please bring me every type of strapless bra that you have in my cup size and it took her 10 minutes to bring each individual bra. I was shocked! I would've been able to pick out all the strapless bras they had in the entire store in the color that I wanted in that 10 minutes. She brought me all the ugly bras that were not even push up that I asked her for....  I just left the bras on the chair and left. Never coming back here again. You just lost a customer that would be spending several hundreds of dollars a month.

I ordered take-out today from this sushi grill and I was not impressed. The quality of the Philly roll was horrible. I also feel it's kind of bogus that although they have specials throughout most of the day and it doesn't apply to take out. So they pretty much want to force you to stay and eat at their place, doesn't make any sense to me. When I walked in the hostess was a bit overbearing and almost attacking when she greeted me, a bit unpleasant and caught me off guard when she shouts, "HOW MANY?????!?!!??!" The heck lady, relax, I actually ordered take out..... :O Several people were staring at me after! Not coming here again.  A coworker told me that when he came to this location he was food poisoned and his tuna had a rotten smell to it and supposedly the owner talked to him and apologized, so this assured me that I will not be at this location ever again.

Horrible just horrible customer service with geek squad! If you have a serious problem with your computer don't take it here because they're to lazy to fix it! I spent $200 on the service to fix my computer and they said they removed a virus, but my computer still was running slow and I was still being attacked by viruses. I took it in several times into two different stores. I called customer service and I had several agents take over my computer and they also couldn't find a virus. I took videos of the things that were going on with my computer, I took it in to Best Buy and I showed them my videos and they still didn't believe me. I went into this location to see the manager Danny he also couldn't find anything wrong with my computer and he wouldn't give me my money back. I then called another company and told them that this virus is attacking my computer and I gave them the name of the virus they told me that it is a very serious virus high severity. I was so upset so much time wasted and my computer is still not fixed, I called customer service and canceled my service and got my money back. Danny was not a joy to work with. If you're reading this just watch there was a virus on my computer but you were just too lazy to find it. I ended up downloading a free program and I remove the virus by myself for free. The virus is called peweliks. Save your money Google how to remove it yourself it's doable. Never coming back again! Customer service gave me back my money right away and Danny the manager couldn't even help me. Just horrible a week wasted! Not having a computer is very hard especially when you're a student!

NEVER EVER EVER doing business with this company again! I placed an order online to have the flowers delivered at 3pm. I placed this order at 10am and they managed to mess it up. I called 3 times asking where the flowers were and they told me the delivery guys are on their way. It's already 6pm and they close at 5pm and still my mom didn't get her flowers for Mother's Day. Apparently the lady who took my order wrote it down to be delivered tomorrow. I understand it's a simple mistake that can happen to anyone, but when she already remembers who I am when I keep calling, she still wasn't able to figure out that she made a mistake? My mom is leaving for a cruise so I won't be able to see her on Mother's Day and I wanted to do something nice, but this business screwed everything up for my mom and I. Never doing business with them again. If you don't do time reservations maybe you shouldn't have that option online to write it at or be more specific because I had no idea. I would have at least expected them to bring it before the end of the day. Big mistake.

I'm from Chicago and I love this place! The pizza is amazing and tastes just like Ledos pizza from back home in the CHI. I love the thin and square cut slices so much better then the regular triangle cut! I will be back! This is what real pizza should taste like!

Normally come here because it's close to work. Good for that fast meal. But man I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken was barely there. So hard, could barely swallow it. Yuck! Last time I order this off their menu.

I haven't even been registered to this school yet and know one knows anything and can't help me! I don't understand what's with a $65 application fee, which is ridiculous you're already going to be paying thousands of dollars anyways why another 65?? Goodness and the fact no one can tell me anything about what classes I can take at my community college that can transfer over! They keep saying looking at the map or the layout which I did but it doesn't say anything and it's not specific then they want me to wait couple months before I speak to an academic counselor! They can't guarantee that your credits will transfer until you pay the 65$ fee! What a rip off! I'm seriously second guessing this school!

Spent lots of money here to do the floors and every box we bought there were cracked pieces. We had to return almost every box. That was very inconvenient having to drive back and forth wasting my time and my gas for this crap. Now we ordered carpeting and the woman who took down our information and address messed everything up. Apparently she got our address and phone number wrong and now the installation company can't get ahold of us because of that. Like you have one job to sit on your ass and type is it really that hard? The girl had long fake nails, acting like she's all that. She didn't even look at us she kept chewing her gum like a cow and it seemed she didn't even wanna be there. What kind of service is this? Wow-

This is the second time coming to this location. It's always so slow! I ordered white rice, orange chicken, and Beijing beef with cream rangoo and now I am throwing up none stop! Totally food poisoned. Be careful eating here, k seriously don't think I can eat at another fast food place again. Just thinking about it is making me nauseas! My friend also ordered from here the same time I did and she is nauseas as well! Did you people spit it in or something???

First time staying here and honestly I was a bit disappointed. I normally stay at Planet Hollywood, but decided to come here and I thought were going to get a suite with two bedrooms but it looks like we got only two queen beds. The bathroom doesn't even have a vent in it, how is this possible? There was no fridge in the room either.  Over all it was just a basic room nothing fancy. I won't spend that much money here ever again. In the casino good luck getting one of the girls to get you a drink it takes them forever! I will always be a Planet Hollywood girl!

I made the appointment and was able to come in that same day. I hard a hard time finding the location, but it is in the strip mall where the grocery store is at, I think it was Albertson's. I came in and I didn't have to fill out any paperwork, which already was a red flag to me because liability? safety? where will the massage therapist touch me? Hello? I asked the receptionist and she told me that the massage therapist will talk to me about that before my massage. Ok. The massage therapist came out and the guy was my age, which made it a little bit uncomfortable and made me worried because of his potential experience level. I wen't into the room and there was no chair to put your clothes on or anything. He told me to put it on this shelf, which had the hot stone fridge on it. My clothes were cramped into a corner. He came back in and didn't really ask me any questions, he seemed very shy and nervous. I told him just to focus on my back and neck because I have been having back pain for some time. He started massaging me and it started fairly well, but he doesn't have any kind of technique. I am a very delicate girl, so I need very light pressure, which I told him, but I don't think he understood me at all. I said many times a little less please and he didn't change his pressure at all. This is the problem with male therapists, they don't know their own strength. He ended up pressing down on all my pressure points which hurts so much I was screaming and whining and he heard me very well. I couldn't lay still. He kept telling me that I will thank him later.... I just wanted to relax and I ended up cringing in pain. That's not the kind of massage I wanted at all, but I said many times can you just gently rub my skin because right now it's so hot and red I need like a gradual slow pat after being tormented, he didn't understand at all. He did my back for 30min and then told me I had 30 more minutes, what did I want massaged next? I'm like uhhh my back?? neck?? Anyways, he finished and I started to get dressed and found my clothes were moved to another shelf... my pants where my underwear were were moved to another shelf, so awkward! :( He gave me water when I cam out and it was in a plastic cup... no water bottle? It was just a weird experience. He even had the decency to ask me if I would come back again. I said yes, but what kind of questions is that? I can't say no out loud and make all weird. Never will be back here at all. Never thought it would be this hard to find a good massage salon.

Dad was injured and we bought a ladder from Costco and they offered to help us load it. We waited 10-13 min and no one came to help us and they just said "oh they're on there way" uhmmm yeah we gotta be somewhere, we're not going to wait 30min for help. All the workers were chit-chatting and ignoring us. Not good customer service.

I am BEYOND disappointed. Everyone at work has been telling me how this location has good pizza and how it's exactly like back home in Chicago. They were far from Chicago pizza. This was mediocre. I am so disappointed with these guys... I ordered the deep dish, being from Chicago I know what a deep dish is supposed to look like. This deep dish was like a thin crust, with the crust being 2 inches tall! They gave me an extra pizza for free because someone else at work ordered from here, so I guess they were trying to butter me up, so I order more from them. The free pizza was a thin crust, hm just like the "deep" dish. This thin crust was so dry it wasn't eatable... Just no. I tossed the whole pizza. The deep dish wasn't tasty and very crispy almost burned. I can tell it's over done, can't believe they'd send it out like that. Called to get my money back, which they said they'll cancel the charge...(I hope).  Not coming here again. My stomach is already making sounds. Great-

Horrible service. Just unbelievable. The manager tries but he will disappear. I waited two hours to be helped I had a quick question. No I waited two hours and the guy was helping people who just came in! It's like hello I'm right here! Finally I was helped but the guy wasn't pleasant and couldn't help me. It took him 5 min to send me away! Two hours wasted!!!!! I came in the next day and waited an hour and a half and they were packed again and I just wanted to return the iPhone 6. I cancelled service with sprint after 24 hours because of horrible service and they couldn't even wave my restocking me. How horrible, I was happy to get the hell out of this store. Torturing me for two days. Never will join sprint or come here again. The workers and this store make me sick!!!

First time here and being from Chicago and how picky and demanding we can be I loved this place. Came here with the parents for dads birthday. The place is smallish, but it does have a bar and a TV. Very very fresh food!!! The chicken is so tender and so delicious! They start you off with pita, butter, and sweet onion. I am super pleased and will definitely come back!  P.S you know the food is good when your leftovers taste amazing! Still fresh and tender after reheating!

Everyone at work is talking about this restaurant with such praise, but i just ordered from them and wasn't really happy with my food. I got my money back, but I guess this just isn't my type of food, I don't know. I don't understand the combination of ingredients. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and there was blue cheese and slaw in it. So strange to me, I understand they're being creative, but this isn't my thing. Bread was hard as a rock, had to pull it out of my mouth to tear it. Oh well guess I'll stick to the basics! Customer service was good.

I hate to do this, but I totally give it a one star. The first time I was here it was great and then I came here a few day ago and I had a horrific experience. I came in after 5pm with my friend and I asked the waitress if I can customize my meal and she says yeah of course. So I told her that I'm a simple person and I just wanted angel hair pasta and grilled chicken. I order a beer as well, and of course the beer comes first. So we're drinking having a good time and then the food comes and my dish is filled with vegetables and just completely wrong and not what I wanted. The waitress apologized and admitted she misunderstood what I said and I had no problem, it's okay it happens. At this point I was kinda upset because my friend started eating and I haven't even received my food yet. 8 min later my food comes out and by the time I picked up my fork my food was cold and in all honesty it was our fault that we chose to sit outside when there was a breeze, but my food was very cold. After that I realized there was no Alfredo sauce and it was solo dry so I asked if they had any Alfredo sauce and she said they don't. I asked her for butter at least and she brings me frozen butter which won't melt on a cold pasta dish. So I was stuck eating butter pasta with cold butter stuck to each noodle. I found a piece of broccoli in my dish and a random noodle that wasn't angel hair as well. I'm almost done eat and my second beer hasn't arrived, so I flag a random waiter and ask him if he can cancel my beer because I'm done eating already and my second beer hasn't come yet. By the time he leaves our waitress comes with my beer. Ugh! I tell her I cancelled it and she says it's on the house. Eventually the manager came and talked to me and I explained to her what happened and she didn't charge me for the pasta. Thank god I didn't have to pay for that because I make better pasta then that. Pasta is pasta how do you mess that up? You can tell the chefs didn't stir it because some noodles were stuck together. I mean cmon I'm not asking you to make me lobster. It's just pasta. I don't think I'll be back and if I ever get forced to come here I'll sit inside and come on a not so busy day. :/

This is the third time being here and I gave it 3 chances and I won't be back again. Every time I place my order they get it wrong. The chicken is good which is why I gave it two starts, but that's really all that's good here. I always end up having heartburn and a watery stool when I'm done eating here.

I had healthy nails(like gel nail polish, but makes your nails super hard) from a salon prior to coming here. Wanted the healthy nails removed because it was 2 weeks old. I told the lady it's my actual nail she didn't believe me and kept playing with it. Finally she understood what it was and told me it wasn't a good idea to remove it because my nails would be brittle. I told her I knew that, but I don't want this stuff on my nails anymore. After 15min of figuring out what we're going to do, I finally told her just to file the hard coat down and paint over it. Please note that it costs an extra $5 to remove gel polish, never been to a salon that charges you for that. Also she told me it would cost $3 extra to file the nail shorter because I have the hard coat of gel on my nail.... Huh?? It makes no difference to file a nail that's real or gel it files easily. I questioned it and she scratched that off her "things to say to get more money out of me"..... The massage lasted 20 seconds if that per hand, the hell? Paid $19 for this??. She wasn't pleasant to be around, was walking around me doing stuff, instead of working on me. A simple manicure lasted 45 min.... I would like my money back, but when I called the manager he said I can't get my money back and I can only get them redone and it has to be the same color and they wouldn't be able to do both hands, just the fingers that are not good. I was charged $5 for removal of gel WHEN I STILL HAVE GEL ON NY FINGERS. What if the color was the issue? You will paint the same bad color all over again? Really? I asked for my tip back that I gave the girl because she didn't deserve it and he said no, after I got really upset on the phone he finally told me that he would give me the tip back. BE CAREFUL, if they mess up they won't refund you, you'll just have to dread going back there and listen to them talking crap about you in their foreign language while they redo your nails. So irritated.

First time ordering from this place and will never order again. Pizza came on time, ordering over the phone was easy, but when the pizza came..... It omg was just uneatable. I am from Chicago, I know my pizza, this place doesn't cut it at all! The dough was so thin that the whole pizza can't hold even cheese. Parents had a supreme and it all fell apart. They had to get a knife and fork. Yes I love my deep dish pizza and I eat it with a fork and knife too but at least deep dish is tasty, this was just dreadful. Very greasy and the bottom of it was slightly burned. I called and complained and they apologized and said in 10 min they will bring another. It came and it was EXACTLY THE SAME. I am not sure how people like this type of pizza but even the cheese looks all weird like someone chewed it and spit it on the dough. Never ordering from this place either. Shame you say it's from the heart of New York, because New York pizza is amazing too and this is just embarrassing. Go to rosatis pizza, not sure how to spell it, but that's really good Chicago pizza.

Just moved to Goodyear and wanted my prescription switched to this Walgreens. The lady told me that all the Walgreens are connected so there's no need. Came back a few days later to refill and the guy this time couldn't find anything under my name. The guy was new and was sweet and was able to help me out, but the girl before him was clearly stupid or something. Another thing quit asking customers "can I help you" like once is enough but 7 times within 15 min are you serious right now! Leave me alone. I had to go to another Walgreens because I'm afraid to go here. I'm just looking around.... Goodness!

First time  at this location. The line was so long I think it was 13 people total in line and I was in the back. Took 30min or so for me to order and walk. Several workers were clumsy and dropped a bunch of pans which was sooo loud. It seems to me they can't handle a busy crowd. I don't know who or where the manager was, but neither of these employees acted like a manger. My serving size was good and the food was good, but that's about it. Everyone was looking irritated by how slow they were.

I don't think I ever wrote a review for this Life Time, if I did, it probably got deleted. I joined because it was close to home and heard good things about the gym when I was in Chicago, but I guess the location does matter. If you expect to have the same customer service like in a big city you're mistaken. I joined and they told me they have to have a trainer talk to me about my goals, I told them I didn't want to speak to a trainer, but I guess it was part of their process. The trainer I was working with I can't remember his name for the life of me, but he was dreadful.  When the trainer was asking me questions "to get to know me", he kept staring off in the distance at someone else, while I was talking!! I could tell he really didn't care. He made me feel completely dumb and worthless. I gave him my goal weight and he told me that I needed to lose more, uhm excuse me!!!?? After this I complained and he was informed about it and started giving me looks each time I would come in. I didn't feel comfortable being at that gym anymore... one time I was walking down the hallway and he was with the other trainer talking about something the second I walk passed they stop talking, stare at me, and then start whispering... no clue if it was about me, but regardless it was unbelievably unprofessional. I cancelled my membership with 48 hours. They didn't even try to keep me as a member, pretty much just said, sorry to see you go and have a good day. Never again.

I'm from Chicago and I was disgusted by this place. I don't understand what the big deal is about this place? The patty is paper thin. I shouldn't have to order 3-4 patties, it should be a real burger that's a good 1/2 inch to an inch thick and juicy inside. There was no seasoning and no flavor. Just a plain burger like I would get from Burger King. I'm happy they don't have these in Chicago. Clearly the west coast doesn't know what a real burger is supposed to be/taste like.

Ashlee did my hair and I am very pleased. She not only listened to what I wanted, but she also explained to me what will be the process. She stayed over an hour to help me get my hair back and the price was reasonable. Will be coming back to see you. I met David and he was very friendly and professional. I don't know what the other review was talking about. Hard to please everyone I guess, but this salon does a good job. Really clean and fairly big. Everyone was friendly and approachable. Not snobby at all, which is the one thing I can't stand about salons. Love it!!! :))  I went for a haircut at Ulta and the lady there showed me what a horrible job the colorist did with my highlights. There were many different shades of blond on one stand of hair. Several toners were used and now my hair is a rainbow. The angle the highlights started at were all in different directions. I appreciate her hard work but I had no idea what the highlights looked like on the back of my head until the lady from Ulta showed me. Ashlee is very nice no doubt about that, but the last time I went in I wanted the dark brown out of my hair that was on the bottom section and she said she put many highlights in that area and that it would be fine, but that's not what I wanted!  I wanted all dark brown out of my hair and to go blond. Wasn't everything I wanted and won't be back. I like the salon and I'm sure there is a stylist that's good but because of one experience I don't feel comfortable going to the whole salon now. Ugh.

Made an appointment last minute and thankfully they had time available, which is awesome! I came in and it's very clean and relaxing. I filled out the form since it was my first time here. Only thing that's concerning is they didn't have a sheet that tells the massage therapist where or where I don't want to be massaged.   I was taken back into the room and Rosie started massaging me. The foot pillow was already on the table, which is unusual since they usually put it there later on in the massage...  But alright. Massage started and I told her to focus mainly on my lower back, shoulders, and neck. She did an ok job. There wasn't really a technique and some moments it kinda hurt. The main reason why I am giving it a 2 star was my hands, feet, chest, head, and the front of my arms and legs weren't massaged. So I wasn't able to fully relax. I don't feel like I had a massage. On top of that it was kinda ruined when she kept yawning in front of my face.   The cost of the introductory offer is 49.99, which I feel is a lot for what I got, plus I didn't get the full hour. Massage started at 6:30pm and ended at 7:18pm. Always awkward to say how the massage really was in front of the workers when they ask. I wish they had other scented oils because my body smells weird from that oil. If it cost more to have a different kind of oil I would spend another $10. If you do offer it I had no clue, since no one said anything. In realty I wanted a 2 hour massage, but since I was new I was offered the 1 hour. I would have gladly paid more for two hours. Sighs- I won't be back to this place.  ***** October 30th 1pm.... Went back and gave them another chance. Rebecca massaged me this time. It was an amazing massage. She had technique and the pressure was perfect! I will be back. Thank you guys! I appreciate it. I will be back :)))

This is my families first time staying at this hotel since we bought the time share. I really like the rooms except there were a few things that upset me.  1. There was no plug by the night stands in the room, so I can charge my phone.  2. The television power button on the remote doesn't work, it's hard to watch T.V and you can press the power button 50 times and it won't turn on. You have to get up and press main power button on the actual T.V.  3. In the bathroom the wall of the tub kept coming off so you can see the actual wires and stuff, I don't think that's safe....  4. They only provide you with three main forks and three small desert fork, so using the dishwasher wouldn't be smart since you would have to use it 2-3 times a day so you can have clean silverware. So washing by hand it is. There are only three packets of laundry detergent so be aware.  5. Be careful with the door it's so heavy and powerful that if your child puts his hand on accident in between the door and the frame they'll lose their fingers! Even if it's not a kid be careful.  6. Some of the towels have holes in them!  7. The toilet isn't powerful at all and you have to flush twice!  8. There was dust everywhere!!! It seems like no one cleaned this room for a week when there a layer of dust on the paintings and the counter!  Overall I stayed at better hotels and they were $120 a night! Breakfast is expensive so bring food with you, be smart!

I just got my toes done and I got a gel manicure and I had an amazing experience. The salon is clean and everyone looks happy. It wasn't busy this Sunday afternoon so that was good. The nail tech that did my nails was very helpful about my ingrown toe nail and she was very gentle on cleaning it. I definitely appreciated her helping me with my toe, because I was in a lot of pain for several months and every nail salon I went to didn't do as good of job as she did. I didn't know this salon was located here and boy am I glad I found this gem. I will be back. Looks like they have many regulars coming in and those regulars act as if this salon is their second home which is great!  thanks guys!!

First time here, in fact first doctor to see here in Arizona since I just moved here from Chicago. There was definitely a lot of paperwork that had to be filled out, so make sure you come early because I'm normally fast with filling them out and this took me 15-20 min. The waiting room is decent especially the chairs. I came an hour early because I didn't want to be late in an unfamiliar area. I waited 30min and was asked to come in the back. It took doctor 5 min to come into the room if that. Dr. Chaung is one of a kind. Very funny and completely realistic and understanding when it comes to patients. I came with a strep throat and he told me he was 99.9% sure it was strep, so doing the strep tests wasn't necessary especially that it would cost more to do this test when it wasn't necessary. Perfect for me I don't want to spend extra money if I didn't have to. He is on the patients side when it comes to money. He doesn't want the patient to spend more then they have to and that is the best part about this doctor. He's very energetic and expresses himself very well. I would even say he is enthusiastic. He did a great job explaining everything to me, check everything and made sure I didn't have any other questions before he left. Best part he has good bedside manners and shook my hand. Believe it or not when doctors shake the patients hands it really means a lot and it shows respect. Even though it was a 40min drive it was totally worth it. I knew I need antibiotics and I wanted to get them and leave I didn't want to spend much time in there. It was perfect. Thanks so much! Wish there were more doctors like him.

First time here at the shop and I had a good experience being a picky Chicagoan. Looks like a family owned and operated business and I love that because they treat you with respect. It's not a typical building its in a suite, but the signs helped me find the right place. I saw the reviews and had to come here. The guy that's working on my car did a good job explaining to me what's wrong with my car. I'm a female it's hard to understand car stuff, but he explained to me so I was able to comprehend what he is saying, haha. Had to order a part, but labor cost double the car part, which sucks, but it is what it is you know? Definitely will come back if I have any problems with my car again. I'll spread the word for you guys too! :)   ***Only thing is it's sooo cold in there my nose is about to fall off! 64 degrees is a bit too cold.

First time here and ordered a piña colada and when they brought it was just wrong there was lots of ice that I had to chew and it tasted like a smoothie. Tasted no alcohol it also comes with whipped cream just be aware!!! They brought me another one which they fixed but this one was like water! Tasted no alcohol I chugged the whole thing and I don't feel alcohol. Not worth the money. I had many pina coladas and every other place was strong except this place. After I said it's not strong the waiter doesn't offer to add another shot or anything. Not a good experience. Never coming here again.

I'm a little bit disappointed by this place. I read the reviews and was excited to go, but maybe I just got someone who wasn't as good. The lady who did my pedi was cutting my toes so much that it started hurting. She was using the cuticle cutter to cut underneath my toes nail. :O it hurt!! My toes ended up getting ruined in the car and I didn't feel like going back. My nails, I got gel polish and I am on my first week and they already look horrible, they started chipping from the top overall I don't know if I will be back or not. I am scared to spend that much money on nails when they won't look good in a few days. My nails are soft so I need a lot of gel polish on my nails to be able to last.   I don't think I will be pack. I have to commend that it was clean and they had a cool movie on which was enjoyable. Weird part she didn't have me wash my hands after filing. :(

I went in 2 times since I moved to Goodyear from Chicago and both times were unpleasant. The receptionist whoever is at the front desk is so incredibly rude I have no idea how they are still employed. Each time I call I dread to have to speak to them. Why are they working there if they clearly hate their jobs? My mom told me about an experience my dad had with Dr. Monroe recently where my dad was a new patient and my dad's doctor in Chicago was very concerned  about his health and said to get blood work done the next time he makes an appointment. Alright, well he made the appointment with Dr. Monroe and this doctor did no tests and apparently said that it's not necessary to do any blood work. A couple minute appointment just to tell my dad that and he ended up being charged for a full appointment. I mean I am not going to this location anymore, you have lost me as a patient. Get new receptionist because I swear to god I just spoke to whoever is there at 8:30am on a Friday and she had an attitude in her voice and was so unpleasant to speak to. She wasn't helpful at all.  I am going to add more information to my post. I had chest pain for the past 3 days and with it came an anxiety attack. I wasn't dying, just felt pressure in my chest. These guys wouldn't admit me and told me to go to the hospital, so I went to Dignity Health General Hospital, they ran an EKG, did a bunch of tests and I was fine, they were shocked my own doctor would decline me to come in. It ended up being a GERD, which is exactly what I thought it was. Literally felt sent away and rushed off the phone, this is my finally way of saying I will never be going to your office again. You guys should really focus on your rating, because you're falling hard. I'm disappointed there's no good doctors in the Goodyear location, that's concerning. I would really think twice doing business with this office. There phones are always off, not sure if they physically turn them off because they don't want to take any calls or what the deal is, but I call during office hours and it says their office is closed. I wait an hour or two and try calling again and their closed. It makes no sense at all, fix your front desk staff seriously because they're the first a patient sees when coming in. Good luck folks!

Incredibly upset customer. We have spent lots of money with this company. We bought a bed, two night stands, and a dresser and a mirror for it. Everything went well until right now. They give you 25$ to spend on next purchase when you buy something from them, which is great. Went to the store to find a TV stand and they didn't have what we wanted, so we ended up ordering it online and had to wait 4 days, which sucks because they didn't have what we needed and we already found it online before hand and we come to the store and they don't have it! It gets worse we wait for 4 days and go pick it up at the store we bring it in our car and unpack it at home and this TV stand has a huge crack, which is a structural damage. On top of that the corner of the stand is scratched and you can tel that the workers put paint or gloss on it to cover it up. They saw it was damaged and they still delivered it to us?? Excuse me?? Now we call and have them exchange it and pick it up from our house and they said they will, but when we ask for compliment delivery they deny it and say no. After all this hassle they can't help a paying customer that has spent thousand at their store? That is poor customer service. That 25$ they offered us they took that from us and put that towards the delivery, which is about $90, or something like that, so really it doesn't benefit us at all! All this time spent waiting for our TV stand they try to cover up scratches, they can't help us out with delivery which is no big deal for them. I'm done giving my money to this business, no more. Very nice workers, but the policy is horrible. We could have spent lots more because we need more furniture, but we're done with living spaces. They're not very considerate when it comes to situations like this.

I drove to this salon 45 minutes because I read all the great reviews. There's not many good salons in my area, so was excited to try this one. I made an appointment and got there 10min earlier and signed in. The manager helped me find my color out. Everyone was nice and smiling. It's definitely a nice salon, very clean and elegant no doubt about that.   I got called in right away and was greeted by a nice lady, I don't remember her name. Starts with a Q. She was in a HURRY, and I don't know why, maybe the faster she works the more money she will make? She wrapped my fingers in the acetone and the acetone even splashed on my arm because of how rushed she was. It got worse, my nails and I'm sure anyone's nails would be thin and soft after getting gel nail polish off. She took the instrument and started scraping the gel polish off, she was so incredible rough that I thought she is going to take my whole nail off. I mean my nails are so delicate and thin after wearing gel polish for two weeks on them, your nail doesn't breath through nail polish! I start wincing a little bit, but thought its ok its bearable, maybe the next nail won't be that bad, well it got a little bit better, but still why the rush?   She started to file my nails with a white rough filer and she was filing so fast that she tore through my skin on 2 fingers. This isn't a cuticle cut, it's literally sliced. She was filing so fast in one area that the tension, pressure, and speed cut through my flipping skin! Blood started to come out and she started to panic and apologizing profusely. My Saturday was officially ruined because she wanted to quickly get done with me and she didn't care about the quality of her work. I wanted to leave right then and there, but I did not just drive 45 min to leave with cut up nails.   She kept apologizing and apologizing and I kept saying it's ok with tears in my eyes. Kept biting my tongue, so no one would see me tear up....She said sorry about 8-9times. I get it trust me... It happens, but being on a rush is unacceptable. If you don't have time don't do it then.   She ended up filing my nails way too short, been trying to outgrow them and she cut them way to short after I told her I wanted to keep them long. Since she was all freaked out about cutting me she didn't do a very good job. The nail polish doesn't go to my cuticle all the way, my nails are not filled very well because there are some rough spots on my tips that need to be buffed; the nails are very sharp to the touch.   I came to pay and I didn't say anything because I felt bad and didn't want to start freaking out in front of the whole salon. I wasn't smiling and I wasn't even asked how my service was. If I was asked I would have mentioned my experience. I still tipped the girl because she kept saying sorry and I felt bad, but when I sat in my car I started balling my eyes out. Not because I was in pain, but because I drove out here for nothing and wasted my time and now my finger will take more than a week to heel. Can't swim because I have an open wound, so my entire weekend is ruined. Should have listened to my mom and not have drove all the way there just for a $28 service.   I ended up calling the salon after I calmed down, asked to speak to the manager and told her how upset I was and she issues me a full refund. Although that was nice of them to do, it still doesn't fix my cut finger or the sloppy polish job.  So disappointed I will never be back. This was my first time here and last.  **** I lied I came back and saw KAYLEE (12/23/15) and happy I did because she did an amazing job and guess what no cuts! She was fast and gentle. I'll be back, but now I'll only go to her. Too scared to go to anyone else. Please speak up guys when someone is going too fast. I made a mistake not speaking up right away, I get shy sometimes. You guys are still kinda far from my house, but I will do my best to stop by after work to get my nails done :) Thank you Kaylee I appreciate your work.

Came in here twice and was sent away because they couldn't help me and they sent me to corporate. Seems like this store can't do much... Why even have non corporate stores if they can't help customers. Had an employee I don't remember his name but he was Hispanic and wasn't friendly at all. Acted like a smart ass and I am not from here in from Chicago and I moved not to long ago so I am not familiar with this area... When I asked for address to corporate he's like oh turn here then there and I'm like no can u give me address I don't know the street names. He rolled his eyes and looked like I'm asking him for the most difficult question. Gave me address finally and I left and I will never come here again! No one even looks at you when you come in and the looks on their faces seems they don't want to help. Man if I was a manager I would make this place work! Clearly manager isn't doing his job. What a shame.

Just went to The Nail Room and I am some what pleased. Let me say that the salon is very clean, elegant, and new. The prices for service are reasonable if you get a good tech, just like any place. I believe I had a tech by the name of Jordan, who was very nice and professional. I unfortunately wasn't completely satisfied because the toe on my left foot was very long and on my right it was short, so when I got home I ended up filing it down. There ended up being some polish on my cuticles on all my toes, so I had to remove it when I got home. The scrubbing for the callus on the feet wasn't very long it was more of gliding over my feet. I wonder if techs stopped putting more pressure during that service because they would rather have the customer spend more money to pay $5 extra for the grader. My gel nails are pretty good and even, but I will come back and update on how long they lasted.   Over all I will come back, but maybe this time I will ask for a female nail tech, because I never have luck with male techs, sorry. Just an idea for you guys: It would be very nice to have water offered or even better get a liquor license and severe wine or beer, that's how to get lots of customers because that would make you unique and more people would want to come. Also get rid of those stupid toe seperators that ruined my pinky toe and ended up getting it redone, but didn't have two coats put on that toe nail.  Update 8/27/15: my nails are all chipping!!!

I gave them another chance. NEVER again. This is after 1 week. The manager is really nice and had me come back to get it fixed but this one girl didn't even take her time. She just slopped it on there and it chipped so quickly I couldn't believe it.

I heard this place opened up in February and my parents and I decided to try it out for an early Father's Day lunch. We got there at noon and they said we would have to wait about 30min for a table- fine. 15 min or so we were seated. This feeling of this restaurant is kind of like chills or Applebee's. Very CASUAL. This is an Italian restaurant that doesn't serve bread with cheese and olive oil. The place was very busy and semi-loud. We got our entrees and I ordered angel hair pasta with Alfredo sauce and chicken. Mom got a shrimp with spiral pasta and dad got a lasagna. Dad loved his lasagna and devoured it, mom got a mushroom appetizer which she finished and since she is a slow eater she wasn't able to finish her whole meal, so she took it to go, but she said it was good, but they give you only 3 jumbo shrimp, apparently that's a 1/2ib of shrimp. My dish on the other hand was below average. I know my Italian dishes very well and this was disappointing. There was almost no Alfredo sauce in my pasta, which made my noodles very dry. I ate the middle which has the sauce, but couldn't finish the rest. It took me forever to hunt down our waitress and I even asked another waitress to find ours! When she finally came I asked her if she can bring me a cup of Alfredo sauce and just pop it in the microwave because the whole time I was looking for her my dish was cold. She said "how about I just being you a new dish" I was shocked, but said ok thank you. She didn't have to do that and I get kind of bad having them do that over. Anyways in 5 min they bring it out again and the dish is worse than the first one. The chicken instead of spliced was like pulled pork all over my plate and once again where the heck is the Alfredo. The worst part I had a black ladies hair in my dish. I took it out and didn't say anything because I didn't want to wait any longer I was hungry and both my parents were almost done eating. I ate it but trust me I have made better at home and I didn't enjoy it. I won't be back to this restaurant. When a customer is looking around trying to locate a waitress and 3-4 waitresses walk past noticing me staring why not come up and ask if I am ok instead of just walking past me? I realize you're not my waitress, but I thought this would be more like a team environment. Trust me I know it's tough and a lot of pressure to work at a restaurant, but try to smile and work together better. Like I said I won't be back. I miss my bread and olive oil with parmesan cheese. Not a true Italian restaurant. I'm from Chicago too and they have Chicago style stuff but I am too afraid to try it.

My friend took me here for my first time and upon walking in I knew this wasn't my type of environment. It was a Saturday, so obviously it was packed. I don't like craft beers so this definitely was not my kinda place. Inside they have little restaurants where you can order and they'll give you a number to hold on too so they can drop it off to you. So, I have my purse in my hands, the water I had to fill up myself, and this number stick I have to carry to my seat. I almost dropped everything- Friend got oysters so had to wait for those to be ready at the counter, waited for like 15min and my burger came to me, so now I had my purse, water, silver wear, and my plate, this was ridiculous and all before I was at the table. The burger came with a COLD bun.... COLD!! Like it just came out of the fridge. The meat patty was paper thing, HUGE bun and lots of vegetables, the ratio to bread, meant, and vegetables was ridiculous. I took the bun off and just ate the meat, this was mediocre.... Worst burger I ever ate. They didn't ask how I wanted the meat cooked either. $13 burger? Savages- I want my money back! To throw your trash out you have to touch this disgusting bin to open the lid while carrying all your crap, it's like seriously, you gotta have tentacles for this place. Never again will I come here.
