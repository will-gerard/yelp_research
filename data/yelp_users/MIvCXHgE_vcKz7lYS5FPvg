The BF and I went last weekend for the first time after hearing great things about it (and after buying a 2 for 1 Groupon a while back).  We were not disappointed.  My only regret is that we couldn't stay longer because there is so much to see.  I really enjoyed "The Boarding School Experience".  Very interesting...but very sad.  Can't wait to go back!

So, we were hungry after visiting the Heard Museum, and I had just found out I had $50 on my All Access card from the ridiculous amount of money we spend at the Honolulu Hard Rock a year and a half ago, so we decided to go.  It was a Sunday and downtown Phoenix was dead....as was the Hard Rock Cafe.  It just felt kind of depressing.  Service was a bit slow, my Margarita was blue and the food was so-so.  Then I found out the $50 on my card could not be used towards alcohol....which made up over 50% of our bill.  Oh well.  Had a lot more fun and the Honolulu one, but that's probably because we were on vacation.  :)

The BF and I stopped here for lunch one day during the week.  There was only one other table there...and with so many of the other places nearby really busy, we were a little skeptical.  We were not disappointed!  The service was wonderful, the food was wonderful, the bread and dipping sauce they bring out is wonderful!  I think the reason it was so empty is because it is a bit pricy....for lunch.  We loved it though.  I look forward to going back!

We stumbled upon this place after checking out the used furniture store next door. They have a lot of great stuff! They're super helpful and friendly. We bought 5 pieces around 11am and they delivered them at 4pm the same day! Great prices too. Will definitely go back!

We've been here twice and both times have been great!  The chef's aren't usually Japanese, but they do a great job none the less.  The food is wonderful and despite the strip mall exterior, the inside is nice.  It's way better than Benihana in my opinion.

After a morning of hiking me, the bf and our boys we're all starving.  We had actually been to this place once before a few years ago and I'd remembered it being pretty good.  So we headed over.  Everything started out ok.  Our server promptly took our drink order and was very nice.  Our drinks came out quickly along with chips, salsa and shortly after, the tableside guac we ordered.  Salsa was bland.  No heat.  No flavor.  Guac was incredibly bland.  Our server recommended we add salt, but even after adding more...and then more salt, still bland.  Then we ordered.  My oldest son inquired about the seafood enchiladas.  Wondered about the size of them.  Server said they're not all that big, but recommended doing a trio and proceeded to list the different options.  My son decided on two shrimp and one mushroom.  Because we were talking about enchiladas we assumed that he was getting enchiladas.  After waiting what seemed like an eternity our food finally arrived.  The server placed a platter of fajitas in front of my oldest son.  He told her that he ordered enchiladas.  She said she was sure he ordered fajitas but she could take them back and get him what he wanted.  Given the lengthy wait we endured to get our original order, he decided to just eat the fajitas.  I ordered a combo with a veggie burrito, green corn tamale and cheese and onion enchilada.  The burrito was just veggies folded into a burrito.  I've never had a veggie burrito that didn't also have rice and beans in it.  I ended up taking the veggies out and eating them by themselves.  Cheese enchilada was also horrible.  Can't put my finger on what was wrong with it. . Just gross.  Everyone else's food was decent enough.  My other son loved his seafood chimichanga.  So, we're all finished eating and we watch as our server walks speedily past our table a dozen times.  Never asking if we need anything or if we're ready for our check.  Finally she stops and says she'll bring the check.  I had shown her my yelp check-in offer for 10% off at the beginning of our meal and I ask if she applied the discount and she says that the manager did apply it.  So then the check comes.  Our bill was $104.  The 10% discount was $3.95.  So I add everything up...minus the alcohol and get a total of about $84.00.  $3.95 is not 10%.  So despite my fear that if I mention this we will be stuck sitting there for another 20 minutes, I do mention it.  She then returns with the check and says the manager corrected it and informs me that the discount does not count towards alcohol, which I did know.  So, I open the check and now there's a $11.14 discount.  Weird.  Now, more than %10, so I'm not complaining since my son's fajitas that he got by mistake cost $19...way more than the enchiladas would have cost. All in all, not a great experience.  The place was clearly understaffed.  The servers were jogging back and forth from the kitchen and the dining room  No good.  We'll definitely be trying a different place next time.

We tried Pesto's based on a recommendation from a friend and we were not disappointed!  We sat at the bar and I had a glass of their house Cabernet, which was great.  We shared the beet salad to start and it was just amazing!  We followed that with the white pizza topped with pesto and fresh roma tomatoes.  It was the best pizza we've had in a really long time.  The bartenders were friendly and service was great!  I'm so glad we discovered this place!  We can't wait to go back.

My mom and I stopped for lunch on a Saturday.  The place was pretty dead, but I've been to plenty of empty Thai places that are amazing, so not a big deal.  The decor is kind of strange, but that's nothing new with Thai places either.  We were seated immediately and a few minutes later our server came to take our order.  I ordered the Pad See Ew with fried tofu, spice level medium hot (my go to dish).  I told her I wanted it spicy, but not crazy spicy.  My mom ordered the Yellow Curry (mild) with fried tofu and an iced tea.  Our server wasn't very friendly....kind of short with us.  Seemed impatient.  Anyway, food comes out.  It's like mine had not taste.  No heat, no flavor, nothing.  It was honestly the worst Pad See Ew I've ever had.  My mom never got her iced tea either.  I have my go to Thai places, but I'm always eager to try a new spot but sadly, I'll never return to this one.

I was not impressed with this place.  The salsa was horrible.  Bland.  Tasteless.  Watery.  Like tomato sauce...or juice.  Food was nothing special either.  Even the margaritas left a lot to be desired.  Service was a little on the slow side and their patio is depressing.  I'm not sure why so many people like this place.  There are way better Mexican restaurants out there.  We won't be back.

We tried El Rico's today after buying a Weforia deal a while back.  I had heard great things about this place from friends and had been wanting to try it for a while.  We went on a Saturday at about 11:30 am and there was only one other table in the place, but around noon the place really started filling up.  The margaritas were very tasty.  A little on the sweet side, but good.  Chips and salsa were also very good.  The chips were fresh although the salsa could have been just a bit spicier.  I had a veggie burrito and it was just gigantic!  Very good though and I still have half in the fridge.  The BF had the steak fajitas which he said were really good.  Also a very large portion so he has half in the fridge.  The only thing about the fajitas are that the flour tortillas that they brought him were the big giant burrito size which made it kind of hard to make a fajita.  Maybe it was just a mistake, or they were out of the smaller ones.  Who knows.  The other weird thing was the bathroom.  It says on the door "only 1 person...please lock door" or something like that.  But inside it's giant and there are two toilets....but no walls separating them...and no mirror.  Strange.  Anyway, our waiter was very nice and made good recommendations, which the BF just loves.  We will definitely go back.

We tried this place last night because I bought a HomeRun deal a few months back.  We were not disappointed!  We went at 6:30 on a Saturday night.  I had made reservations, but the restaurant was not even half full.  Our server, Chas, was just great!  He gave us lots of info about the menu items and specials.  Made great recommendations and chose a great wine for me.  The food was fabulous, and because I had a hard time deciding between two dishes (a special and the buternut squash ravioli) Chas recommended that I order the special, and then he brought out a small plate of the ravioli so I could try it.  Both were amazing!  We had the chocolate ganache covered raspberry sorbet which was incredible!  Then to top it off, Chas brought us some cannoli's to bring home for our kids!  I highly recommend this restaurant.  The food and the service are top notch!  We will definitely be back!

I love this theater!  We will never go anywhere else from now on.  Sure it costs a little bit more, but so worth it.  Leather recliners and reserved seating!  Love not having to worry about getting to the theater early to find good seats.  Everything appeared to be clean....including the bathrooms.  I have nothing bad to say about this place.

Stopped here for lunch on a Sunday after hiking at Usery park.  I liked the fresh garlic butter rolls they give you before your meal, better than the food I ordered.  I had the Portobello Sandwich.  Didn't care for it.  So much liquid poured out of the sandwich.  Made the bottom bread soggy and was also very salty and rich tasting, which is strange for a Portobello sandwich.  The BF loved his Chicken Jambalaya though.  He can never order Jambalaya because it always has shrimp in it and he has a seafood allergy.  But they had one without shrimp and he said it was fantastic.  My mom enjoyed her veggie burger....even though it was the chipotle gardenburger from Costco.  Service was good and the ambiance was nice enough.  Wouldn't make a special trip to go back though.

The patio was beautiful, but that's really the only good thing I can say about this place.  Service was painfully slow.  Chips were greasy, salsa was bland....no flavor, no heat.  The guac was completly tasteless.  I had to salt it just so I could taste it.  The margaritas were just ok.  My boyfriend and I went for lunch and our bill was $68!  I really wanted to like this place, but we will not be eating here again.

I really enjoyed this place!  The BF and I stopped in for Happy Hour, and ended up staying for dinner.  Really cute place....great decor!  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Good margaritas, good chips and salsa.  I checked in and tried to use the free chips and salsa check in offer, but our server said since it was our first time in, chips and salsa were complimentary!  Great food too!  All in all, great experience and we can't wait to go back!

We tried this place last night after buying a Localdines certificate.  We got there at about 6:30 on a Friday night, and there were plenty of open tables so we were seated immediately.  We we brought water and bread with a super yummy roasted red pepper spread/dip.  Service was prompt, and our server was very friendly and had no problem recommending dishes and discussing menu items.  I ordered the Lobster Ravioli and my boyfriend had a pizza....half blackened chicken and half something else (can't remember...started with a "p")  Our food came super fast!  The lobster ravioli was amazing and the BF said the pizza was very good also.  Glad we tried it and we'll definitely be going back!

I took my mom here when she was in town for Christmas.  We stopped in for lunch and neither of us had ever had Ethiopian food before.  I had read about them on their website and in many of the reviews here on yelp, so I kind of knew what to expect.  We were seated immediately, but it took about 10 minutes for our server to greet us.  We immediately ordered two of the lunch specials which we had brought out on one big plate, and it came out super fast!  Everything was wonderful!  We had a lot of fun eating with the Injera and trying to decide which dish was our favorite.  We tried all six of the vegetarian items listed on the lunch menu.  My favorite was probably the Azifah (the cold lentil dish).  The Misir Wat (red split lentils) was really good too, and my mom's favorite was the Fosolia (lightly spiced green beans).  When the big dish was set in front of us, we looked at it and thought, this isn't very much food....but boy were we wrong.  We couldn't even finish it.  The Injera really fills you up I think!  All in all...a great experience for a great price.  $20 including tip.  Can't beat that.  I will definitely be back!

I brought my kids here last weekend and they loved it!  They open at 10am on weekends and we got there around noon or so on Sunday, and there were only a handful of people there.  The staff was friendly and helpful so we left them for a few hours.  When we came back around 3pm it was much busier!  Still plenty of open spots to climb though.  I bought a bunch of half-off certificates at Groupon-like sites for like $8.  It's for all day climbing with all the gear...even shoes!  I think I'll be trying it next time!

This place is exactly what they claim to be.....vegan comfort food.  Went with my mom who was visiting from out of town.  The Big Wack tasted just like a Big Mac...and the thyme fries were thin and crispy and perfect!  The tahini coleslaw was also very good.  The Calexico burger was good, but not as good as the Big Wack.  We also had the artichoke gratin.  Good, but probably wouldn't order it again.  We had lunch there again the following day because there were other menu items we wanted to try, and were we're so full from our burgers the previous day that we didn't have room for a soynami.  This time we tried the Singapore orange bowl with house tofu and brown rice, and the Kung pow with house tofu and noodles.  Both were really good, but the Singapore orange was better, as was he rice.  Lots of veggies and tofu cooked perfectly.  We even had room to share a soynami made with homemade vegan kit kats and chocolate syrup.  It was really good...although the kit kat could have been chopped smaller.  All in all, really yummy.  Not health food by any means....and quite salty, but yummy still.

My kids and I really liked this place!  Went on a weekday and it wasn't crazy crowded.  We got there right when it opened so there were plenty of chairs, but even hours later there were still chairs available.  The wave pool was definitely the best part.  We rented rafts and spent hours riding the waves all the way in.  So fun!  Food wasn't overpriced either.  I bought some sort of Groupon like certificate so it only cost us $13 per person.  Probably wouldn't pay full price, but they have good deals on certain days of the week if you check their website.  We'll definitely go back!

I had been wanting to try this place for years, but living in chandler we don't make it up that way all too often.  Last week though my 13 year old had an ATV accident and was moved to phoenix children's hospital.  3 nights in, the bf and I were sooooo tired of the cafeteria food that we decided to duck out for a real dinner while the boy was sleeping.  A quick yelp search and I saw that Barrio Cafe was within walking distance!  Score!  So we headed out.  Now being from chandler, we were caught a little off guard as we approached the intersection of Thomas and 16th st.   We weren't in the suburbs anymore, that's for sure.  As we headed down 16th st. past the graffiti and storefronts with bars on the windows, we started wondering if we should have driven.  But then 50 ft ahead we saw the restaurant.  Yes!  We got there around 5:15 so it wasn't busy and we were seated immediately.  Cute place.  Small, charming, with a cute, but really small wood bar by the entrance.  Our waiter came by right away and recommended the Lowrider margarita so we each ordered one.  This is a very authentic tasting margarita.  Lots of tequila, a little bit of lime.  Very strong...but at $12 bucks a pop we each only needed one.  They brought out bread with an olive tapenade, I think.  Really good!  I knew I wanted to try their table side guacamole with the pomegranate seeds and I'm glad we did!  Very yummy!  Great chips too!  Our waiter made some great recommendations, but knowing we were already going to be almost full from bread and guacamole, we opted for tacos.  I had a combo order of the shrimp tacos and the halibut.  The bf got the tacos de carne asada.  Everything was fabulous!  You get 4 with each order and I had to discard the tortillas after two so I could finish them.  They come with either fries or salad.  We were confused about fries coming with tacos, but that's a Spanish thing I guess, so the bf got fries, I got salad.  Great little salad, but boy were those fries good!  They come with a chipotle ketchup and just taste great!  All in all, a great meal, and a great distraction from the stress of my son's accident.  I'd definitely like to go again and try something other than the tacos.  Btw....the boy is ok.  Recovering nicely!

Now I've been to Tia Rosa several times and I've always enjoyed the food and Margaritas.  I specifically love the grilled peppers and onions you receive with some dishes.  That said, last time I was there, I ordered a Vegetarian Burro ($12....which is already quite a lot for a Burro filled with beans), and asked to have some grilled peppers and onions put inside, instead of cheese....and then the grilled peppers and onions on the side instead of the beans and rice.  My burro ended up costing $18!  $3 extra for each addition of the grilled veggies.  I could have got a better tasting burrito at Chipotle...actually 3 veggie burritos at Chipotle for $18...and those come with peppers and onions, and Guacamole!  When you spend $60 on Margaritas, and another $80 on food,  I would expect them to throw in a side of vegetables.

Just tried thus place for the first time after buying a Localdines certificate, and it was fabulous!  Great decor and very friendly, helpful staff.  Our server had great recommendations and wow, was the food good!  I had the grilled vegetarian burrito with the cream sauce and it was definitely one of the best veggie burritos I've ever eaten!  My boyfriend had the blue corn enchiladas, and he about licked his plate clean!  We will definitely go back!

Gave this place a try for a nice quiet Valentine's Day lunch with my guy.  We sat on the patio which is lovely.  Very charming with lots of plants and corks for mulch.  Cute.  The garlic bread they bring out was amazing.  Very light and soft, but oh so good....and they just kept bringing more!  We had the fried ravioli, my personal fave, and it was delicious!  The BF had a stromboli which was recommended by our waitress.  He said it was really good, but it looked more like a calzone to me.  I thought a stromboli was a rolled up kind of pizza thing, but this was folded over like a calzone.  Either was he liked it.  I had the caprese sandwich which I though was really good.  It was on the same type of bread they make the garlic bread from, lightly toasted with tomatoes, mozzerella and pesto.  Upgraded from the chips to the fries on the recommendation of our server and they were quite tasty.  We're anxious to go back and try some different menu items, but we definitely enjoyed our lunch

Tried this place today after buying a Deal Chicken certificate.  We sat on the patio which is just fabulous!  Lots of shade, misters that you can actually feel, and comfortable chairs.  I had some drink with "skinny" in the name...tequila, fresh orange and lime juice, etc.  Super good....and strong.  The bf said they had a great beer selection.  He had Anchor Steam which not many bars seem to have, so he was very happy!  I had the The Vigan....grilled vegetable sandwich.  Very good, but next time I'll order it without the cheese as it was unnecessary and I ended up taking most off anyway.  Fries were great....very skinny and crispy.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  We'll definitely go again!

Great service, great food.  I just need to go another 15 times so I can try all the vegetarian pasties.  I should know better than to order a side though, but was told by our server that the broccoli and cauliflower bake was really good.  Didn't care for it.  Wished I would have saved my 5 bucks.

This is, by far, the best Thai restaurant we've been to in Arizona so far!  We went on a Sunday around 1pm and they were not busy at all.  Maybe 4 or 5 tables of people.  They offer their lunch specials...even on weekends, which was great.  All you can eat soup and salad bar comes with the lunch specials too!  I ordered the pad see ew with tofu, medium spicy, and the bf got the fried rice with tofu, hot.  Then we headed to the soup and salad bar.  The salad was not your typical iceberg lettuce, but a great mix of kale and cabbage, and maybe some lettuce too.  There were cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes, red onion and green onions to add to your liking and a peanut dressing that was super yummy!  The soup was a vegetable soup that was broth with diced veggies in it.  I was barely 2 bites into my salad when our entrees arrived!  I snuck a taste of my noodles, before finishing my salad and soup, and then devoured my pad see ew.  It was just wonderful!  Perfect heat level for me, not oily and super flavorful!  The bf LOVED his rice too!  Said he could easily eat it everyday.  Everything tasted so fresh!  They even had Kiltlifter beer.  We have found our new go to Thai place!

This just isn't my type of Mexican food.  I like a fresher, more gourmet type and this is the traditional kind slathered in sauce with refried beans and rice on the side.  The margs were made from a lime cool-aid tasting mix which I just can't stand.  Service was good though.  Probably won't be back.

I don't know why I waited so long to check this place out.  I've been to Plato's Closet a bunch of times and I can't ever find anything there.  This place was great.  I got two great casual dresses, and I can't wait to go back and look again.  The employees were very nice and friendly too.  :-)

We've been on a pizza kick lately, so when picking a place to celebrate our anniversary, we decided to give Miele's a try.  Wasn't very busy on a Monday night at 7pm and we were told to sit where ever we wanted.  We asked for recommendations on what to order and we were told they've won awards for their white pizza (which happens to be our favorite).  We ordered it with tomatoes and pesto and it was fabulous!  We also order the caprese salad which was very good with not just tomatoes, basil and mozzarella, but also artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and olives.  Loved it!  Then we got the cheesecake for dessert.  OMG.  Soooooo good!  Even though I was full enough to burst I finished every last bite.  Yum!  So glad we tried this place and we'll definitely be going back!

Not impressed.  They just fling spoonfuls of slop into an aluminum takeout container.  Everything lacked flavor.  The guac was disgusting!  Employees were not at all helpful or friendly.  I'll stick with Chipotle for assembly style mexican food.  It's 100 times better.

They service the pool in the house we lease.  They replaced a previous, incompetent, pool company.  They originally came out to do warranty work on the pump, and they talked themselves up so much we hired them to do our weekly maintenance.  I now know it was ALL talk.  They are very inconsistent in their service.  This is the second time now that we can't even use the pool because it's all messed up!  And then they don't show up to make the repairs.  Horrible!

One star is more than these guys deserve.  After my original review I sent a message to Aaron Pools through their "contact us" form.  Below is the response I received from them (I removed last names):  Dear Becky,  We have no idea who you are or who you think you are judging our company who has been in business for over 35 years...you are not our customer.  Mr. A. is who we have been "dealing" with because HE is our customer and with whom you should perhaps show this letter to...he can contact us to dispute anything contained in this correspondence.  Mr. A. had an appointment for us to replace the grids in the filter at 2939 E. Bonanza Road, Gilbert, AZ.  HE is the one who cancelled the appointment so he could research the grid cost and find them at a lesser cost to him.  He did find grids and advised us he would drop the grids off early the week of May 7th but that he would call us to advise us when he in fact had dropped the grids off.  About the only thing you did agree with our office staff is that he did not drop them off until the afternoon of May 10 and when he called us that day he expected an appointment immediately.  We advised him we could not guarantee somebody out there as our schedule was full but we would try to get somebody there that day or Friday.  He was aware that we were booking at that time for the following week.  If he had dropped the grids off earlier in the week as he had advised us he would we would have been able to get this resolved before the weekend of May 12/13, 2012.  We realize Mr. A. is busy, as are we, but we cannot make him find the time to drop them off as he had expected.  Additionally, your pool is cloudy at worse, not green.  If these filters had been taken care of as set on OUR ORIGINAL TIME FRAME APPOINTMENT before Mr. A. cancelled to look for grids on his own, you would not be having this problem created by the grids not being authorized by Mr. Angelotti for us to handle.  It is understandable that home owners are trying to cut back on expenses but we cannot take the heat for that situation.  You really need to take this up with Mr. A.  If he has told you anything other than as we are stating above, I would challenge that statement!   billing@aaronpools.com Aaron Pools, Inc. 480-839-9041  What they don't know is that our landlord is one of our closest friends and everything he tells me is the truth.  I AM the customer, because I was the one who originally said I wanted Aaron Pools to be our pool service.  They were hired because of me, and they will now be fired because of me.  Their customer service skills are definitely in line with their pool servicing skills.  After our pump was finally working again, the pool cleaner guy came out and I asked him about the chlorine level because I had been testing it and it was reading very high.  He dipped his little test strip in and told me everything looked fine.  After he left I took a sample over to Leslie's and had them test it.  The chlorine was at 15ppm!  Good thing I didn't let my kids go swimming.  Stay away from these guys.  How they have managed to stay in business for over 35 years will remain a mystery.

The bf and I tried this place the other night and I thought it was great!  We've lived in AZ for about two years now and this is the first time we've had Chinese food, mainly because I can't find a place that delivers to our house.  Anyway, I ordered the tofu with eggplant in garlic sauce, but was told they were out of eggplant, and the girl taking my order was very apologetic.  Not a problem though...got the broccoli instead.  It was sooooo good!  The next day I ate the leftovers...cold, with my fingers, standing at the kitchen counter!  It could have been less oily though, in my opinion.  The bf got sweet and sour chicken.  He liked it.  Also got some vegetable fried rice and vegetable spring rolls.  Also very good.  If only they delivered!  We'll definitely go back!

When it comes to pest control, you're never going to get rid of all the pests, but these guys are so nice, so professional, and try their best to get rid of the pests and make the customer happy.  Anytime we've had a problem with the service they've corrected it by any means necessary.  Customer service is obviously very important to them.  Andy is just great.  He always gets back to us promptly when we call with an issue.  I highly recommend them!

The BF and I LOVE this place!  Their Margaritas are great...and potent.  We've never actually ordered the chips and salsa, but they always bring us some anyway.  Their salsas are good....but not great.  I love that you choose what filling you want in whatever menu item you pick.  Another great spot for us vegetarians.  We've only been there for lunch, but I'd like to give their happy hour a try!  Definitely recommend!

We've been to Dos Gringos twice now.  Once on a Saturday afternoon and then last night (a Friday).  I've enjoyed myself both times.  They've got a great patio....lots of tables, misters and fans.  The Saturday afternoon was very mellow.  Not many people there....outside anyways.  Margs were decent....so was the food.  Nothing spectacular though.  Last night we got there during happy hour.  There were plenty of tables available, and we had a bunch of $3 margs and $5 appetizers.  They also had a really fun band, but they were unfortunately done playing by like 9pm.  Wish they could have played longer but I guess there's a DJ there later.  Overall, a fun place.  I didn't see anyone behaving badly, but we left by 10pm.  There were all different types of people...all different ages.  Maybe things get a little crazier as it gets later.  Don't know.  We'll definitely be back though!

What a cute little place in Old Town!  We went on a Sunday during football season, so there were a bunch of food and drink specials.  Their margaritas were good as well as the food.  The servers were friendly and attentive.  We don't get into Scottsdale all too often, but we'll definitely stop back in this place!

This place is really good!  I had the drunken noodles with tofu.  A little on the oily side, but otherwise delicious!  My son had seafood fried rice which was also delicious, and other son had the Pad See Ew with Shrimp...also delicious!  We had eggrolls to start and I had the Thai Iced Tea.  I only tried Thai iced tea one other time when my mom ordered it at Thai Rama.  This time it was very different.  There was some sort of milky substance on top.  Not sure what it was, but I really didn't care for it.  Thai iced tea is all new to me though, so I don't know if that's standard or not.  Service was great.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  It was a little on the warm and stuffy side in the restaurant.  I always hate how restaurants are so cold inside so I've learned to bring a sweater everywhere, but I didn't need it here.  I actually wished it was a little cooler.  A first for me.  :-)

The BF and I really like this place!  The fish tacos are amazing!  Fun atmosphere, BF loves the beer, Margaritas are decent, but nothing great.  Happy hour starts at 2pm which is nice because a lot of times when were get out for lunch it's after 2.  Servers are friendly and helpful.  Definitely recommend!

The BF and I just love this place!  Fabulous margaritas....and cheap during happy hour!  Great chips and salsa, and tableside guacamole.  The Enchiladas de Avocado is our favorite entree.  It comes with this amazing jicama salad which I think I love even more than the enchiladas.  Service is always good....everyone's friendly.  Bartenders are great too.  This is our go-to margarita spot!

My boyfriend and I thought this place was great.  We went during happy hour and sat at a big picnic table outside.  Service was prompt.  All drinks and apps were half price.  I had a skinny margarita and the nachos.  The margarita was a little on the bland side.  Will have to try the original next time.  Nachos were decent enough, but nothing special.  Boyfriend had the wings and really liked them.  This is definitely a party place.  We had fun though, and when were we leaving there was a line out the door of people waiting for happy hour seating, so get there early.

If we'd have seen this place just driving down the road, we never would have stopped because from the outside it doesn't look like much. But because I had read so many great reviews we decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad we did! We've now eaten there at least 5 times....each and every time was amazing. The staff is great! The food is absolutely incredible! Beautifully presented and perfectly prepared. The entire staff works very hard to make sure you have a great dining experience. I have not stopped recommending this place to people since I first ate there, and I'm looking forward to our next visit!

I tried this place a couple weeks ago for lunch, and it was good.  I got the garlic chili vegetables with tofu...heat level 3.  Boy was I sweating!  Really good though!  The only bad things were that the soup was barely warm and the toilet wouldn't flush in the ladies room.  Great service though....food came out super fast!  Will definitely go again.

Actual date of visit:  3/6/11  Wow...I wish I had read the other reviews before going to this place. It was our first time to Tempe Marketplace and the Cadillac Ranch looked like a cool place to grab a couple drinks and some appetizers. We sat outside in the sun....and that was the only good part. The first 3 beers my boyfriend tried to order off of their beer list, we were told by our indifferent waitress, that they no longer carried them. My margarita's were weak. When our waitress came to take our order my boyfriend asked "what's really good...what do people just love?" She shrugged, looked really confused, and said "well, everyone likes different things so I don't want to recommend anything cuz you might not like it". He asks that question every single time we go to a new restaurant and he's always got great recommendations. So we decide to start with an order of nachos. 7 above average sized, greasy, round tortilla chips with melted cheese, a few black beans sprinkled on along with some chilis and tomatoes maybe...for $7.99. The sour cream and guac cost an extra $1.50. At this point we still have no napkins or silverware. When we finish the tiny portion of nachos, we order the fried ravioli...which we're told a few minutes later that they're all out. So, we just ask for the check, which I promptly put my Discover card in and give back to the waitress. 2 minutes later she brings it back because they don't take Discover. Why doesn't that surprise me?

Just tried this place after buying a Localdines certificate, and it was pretty great.  The bruschetta was great.....the roasted garlic, goat cheese and arugula w/ balsamic was my favorite!  We also had the Margarita pizza, which I though was good, but not great.  I also had the Pomegranate Margarita which was very tasty, but weak.  Nice decor, friendly staff, nice outdoor patio.  All in all, we'll definitely go back.

I really like this place!  I'm no sushi connoisseur, but everything I've had here has always been really good!  Happy hour is great....select food and drink items for half price...and it's in the whole restaurant.  Great service, fun atmosphere!  We will go back again and again!

Stopped in with the BF today to give this place another try.  It was a beautiful day so we sat on the Patio, which is quite charming.  We got there during their daily happy hour which is from 2-6.  I had a glass of wine...$2 off, and the BF had a Kiltlifter, also on HH special for $5 I think.  Tried the greek fries again.  They were good, but I still wish they had more of the sauce/dressing on them.  Lot's of feta though.  The BF order the Chicken Shawarma pita which he said was really good.  I had the Cyprus Salad which was amazing!  Mixed greens with the grilled Halloumi Cheese along with herbed couscous, grilled onions, olives, tomatoes and feta.  Soooo good!  The BF was still hungry so he ordered the Pouekia, phyllo dough stuffed with cheese, fried and drizzled with honey and dusted with cinnamon and powdered sugar.  Amazing.  Really my only complaint was the water.  Tasted like dirt.  The other table seemed to like their water just fine, but I just couldn't stomach it.  Service was amazing though and all in all, we left full and happy and anxious to go back.

My mom and I drove up from Chandler to give this place a try.  When ever she's in town we try a veggie restaurant we haven't been to before.  Fresh Mint was well worth the drive!  We arrived around 2:30 pm and were greeted immediately by the owner.  He told us to take a seat where ever we wanted and he'd bring menus and silverware.  We sat outside.  We ordered the spring rolls to start and my mom got the Pho.  The spring rolls came out quickly and were oh so good!  My moms soup came out a few minutes later and it was quite large for the small.  We ended up sharing it and it was also really good.  We ordered the pepper steak and the hot pot...both to share.  The pepper steak was amazing!  The veggies were cooked to perfection and the sauce was pure yumminess.  It came with some roasted potatoes that were crispy on the outside and buttery soft on the inside.  I had never had a hot pot before.  I really didn't know what to expect. At first I didn't think it was as good as the pepper steak.  I think that's because it was in fact, extremely hot (temperature hot) and that took away from the flavor.  As it cooled down though, the flavors came through and it was every bit as good as the pepper steak.  There are so many other dishes I can't wait to try.  Great service, great food.  Looking forward to going back.

My parents took me to Chakra 4 for my birthday and it was fabulous!  First of all the Town & Country shopping center where it's located is absolutely charming in itself!  The restaurant is small and cozy and has a lot of character.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  We had a large press of the "joyful" (i think) tea which we also got 50% a discount on because of my yelp "check in".  I also ordered their special water carafe which had muddled oranges, mint and some flower I can't remember.  Super yummy!  My parents are both currently eating raw so my mom got the "noritos" which were amazing!  So fresh and yummy!  My dad got the "tacos carnivale" which were also incredible!  I ordered the "veggie-dilla" which was very good too, but after tasting both of my parents dishes I really wish I would have ordered one of those.  I definitely will next time.  For dessert we split a piece of the "raw chocolate cherry cheesecake" which was incredibly rich and satisfying.  I highly recommend this place and can't wait to get back there myself to try one of those raw dishes!

My favorite thing about this place is their Happy Hour!  $3.95 food specials and now $5 drink specials (that's new it think)!  Can't beat that. The bar area does get very busy, and it's not that big, so be prepared to wait for a seat/table.  We have eaten there for lunch and dinner also and everything has always tasted amazing!

This is a nice little place.  We've only stopped in for drinks and apps a couple of times, but the bartenders are really nice, and my Margarita was good (which is rare for a bar/pub type place) and the onion rings are yummy.  We'll definitely go back!

Haven't tried the food....just the chips, salsa and guac.  All very good I thought.  Great margaritas too!  Sat on the front patio...the lounge patio.  It was nice and comfy, but the cushions on the chairs were pretty dirty and stained.  I'd like to go back and  try the food next time!

I love GB for their Happy Hour and their Dragonberry Mojitos!  I'm a huge fan of the tapas appetizer.  I only wish they had more vegetarian items on the menu.  Great ambiance, great service....will continue to be one of our "go to" places near home.  Update 5/15/12:  They've changed their menu and added a vegetarian and vegan section!  Love it!

I love Pita Jungle sooo much!  I go for the hummus alone, but everything else I've ordered has been fabulous.  The lentil fatoosh salad is my favorite menu item (besides the hummus trio), but the last three times I've had a special....the red quinoa salad.  OMG.  Best. Salad. Ever.  I crave this salad.  I wish they'd add it to their regular menu.

I've had margaritas at hundreds of restaurants, and the house margarita at Garcia's was by far the WORST one I've ever had.  So bad, in fact, that I didn't even finish it.....and that's never happened before.  It tasted more like a lime popsicle....that supposedly had tequila in it.  The spinach queso was good, as well as the chips.  Salsa was mild.....bland.  It took our waiter well over 5 minutes to take our drink order, but service improved after that.  All in all, probably won't be going back.

This was my first time eating at an actual Thai restaurant, and I loved it!  Went for lunch and our waitress was very helpful and recommended a great spicy tofu dish, which was amazing!  Lunch combo came with soup, which was sooooo good!  Our waitress said they (the servers) make it themselves during the week for lunch.  It's very light and fresh tasting...and vegetarian!  Also came with a spring roll, rice and wontons.  Our bill came to less than $20 for 2 people!  I will definitely go back!

We've been here a couple of times, but just tried their happy hour for the first time, and I must say....I'm a fan!  $3 Margaritas and lots of cheap food items.  No wonder the patio/lounge is always packed!  We got there about 4:30 and we snagged one of a few empty tables, but anyone coming around 5 had to stand by the entrance an wait for a table to open up.  Because it's soooo busy during happy hour, service can be a little slow, but it's not because they're not trying.  Margs were decent and the sushi rolls I had were tasty!  We'll definitely be going back!

I've been here twice now, and both times the food was fabulous.  Ate at the cooking table both times, and had the vegetable dinner both times.  It comes with tofu and it was prepared differently both times.  Good both times, but I did prefer it the first time I was there.  Our chef was great!  A lot of fun, and very friendly!  Sadly he had just put in his two weeks notice and was transferring to the Goodyear location.  All in all, a great place.  We will definitely go back.

We've eaten at Arriba a few times now.  I really don't care for their food, and service is slow more often than not.  The first time we went we were there it took a good two hours!  And that's not because we're slow eaters.  We did stop in for happy hour last week though, and although their margaritas aren't the greatest, they're decent enough!  They ofter a 12 oz. house margarita for .99 or a 24 oz. grande for 4.99.  Why people would pay five times as much for a marg twice the size, I don't know.  We each had three .99 margs, ate the chips, salsa and bean dip and our bill came to 5.94.  $6 and I left with a full stomach and a buzz.  Nice!

We stopped here for lunch on our way to drop my parents at the Airport after I read the other reviews. I was pleasantly surprised! It's small inside, with patio dining also available. There was only one server but he was very friendly and attentive. It did take a little longer than I would have thought to get our sandwich wraps and fries, but the food was great! When I'm in the area I would definitely stop in again!

I've only had margaritas and appetizers here, but I think this place is great!  Fun, outdoor patio complete with sand, a pool, and cabanas.  First time there we sat outside.  Second time we went there because we wanted to sit outside, but the patio was closed for a private party.  Bummer.  Was nice inside too though.  Third time we went at night with friends and I couldn't believe how crowded it was!  It's definitely a party place.  Our waitress that night was great!  Never kept us waiting, despite how crazy it was in there.  Margaritas are good.  Chips and salsa are good too....even though they charge for them.  The red salsa has a kind of strange taste, but the green is fabulous!  Guac is decent....nothing special though.  Overall, this is a fun place to hang out and have a couple drinks.

Great food, great drinks, great bartender, cute place....what more could you ask for?  Went on a Saturday around 4 and they had happy hour for drinks only.  I had the Zombie, which was great!  It was very tropical and pineapply tasting and very large.  Not like a typical cocktail where you take 4 sips and all that's left is ice.  It lasted me forever!  I ordered the South Seas Fish Tacos and they were amazing!  The fish was perfectly seasoned and cooked up tender and juicy.  The rice and beans were super yummy too.  My only complaint is there could have been more beans on top of the rice.  The BF had the Crispy Spicy Chicken Tacos and loved them too!  Their margarita was great too, which I had for dessert.  :-)  Can't wait to go back and try something else.

We went here after I bought a local dines certificate.  The place is really cute!  There weren't a too many people there when we went, maybe 8 tables or so, and only one waitress.  She did an amazing job taking care of all the tables.  We had a few different types of the bruschetta and the fondue.  Everything was really tasty!  We will definitely go back!

Their website says they deliver.  After spending 20 minutes looking at their menu and putting together my $80 order, I call and I'm told "sorry we don't deliver".  Inaccurate information on a business website is a big giant no-no.  Waste of my time.

I like this place more than most other nail salon's I've been to.  I get a pedi maybe once a month and this place has given me the most consistent service.  One of the times that a man did my pedi he massaged my legs to hard and they were sore for days.  They always do a great job on my toes though.  Nice paint job and pretty designs when I ask.

My boyfriend and I just love this place!  Part of the reason may be because of Cantina Laredo, which is our favorite Happy Hour spot ever....but it's still a great little outdoor shopping mall.  Not a huge variety of stores, but it's great for us who live in the East Valley.

This place is great!  I called at 8:30 am to make an appointment for that afternoon for 3 people.  The place wasn't open yet, but the phone was forwarded to I think the owner's cell.  He told me he would be at the store at 9:30 and he'd call me back when he had the schedule in front of him.  Sure enough, at 9:30 he called me back and was able to schedule our appointments for 3pm.  When we got there we were immediately brought back to a small room that had 3 big, comfy chairs.  We sat down and a couple minutes later they brought in 3 tubs of warm water for our feet.  They reclined the chairs and started at our heads.  They massage your face, head, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, feet and calves.  The they tell you to turn over, as they quickly turn the recliner into a massage table and proceed to massage your whole back side....all fully clothed.  It was just wonderful....and all for $30!  I definitely recommend!

I love this place!  Gets very busy during lunch, and the wait for your food is long, but so worth it!  I had a green smoothie which was great, and the raw tacos.  OMG.....sooooo good!  I can't believe something raw could be so good!  I wish it was closer to my house.  There are a dozen more menu items I'm dying to try!

My son has been taking guitar lessons at Rokk Skoool for about a year and a half now and he just loves it. He shown great improvement and now that he's taking the Rokk Band class, he really enjoys learning new songs and performing them. Eric does a great job with the students. You can tell he love's teaching. I definitely recommend Rokk Skoool!

Stopped in for lunch before a meeting the BF and I had up the street.  Pretty dead at 1pm on a weekday, but that's ok because we could actually find parking.  Great decor, great patio...or kind of a patio because it is technically inside.  Our server was really nice and helpful.  Made great suggestions and was very prompt.  We don't get up this way all that often, but when we do we'll definitely stop in again.

I love Chipotle!  Their vegetarian burritos are the best!  We eat at this location a few times a month, but on our last visit, the girl really skimped on the rice and beans and we had to wait for the fajita veggies to finish cooking.  Not our best visit, but won't keep me from eating there either.  :)  Oh, and the have GREAT margaritas!

For a fast food type Mexican restaurant, I love this place.  I'm not sure they have the Blackened Salmon Burrito anymore, but that thing was amazing!  Their salsas (salsa bar) are pretty much average, but it's nice to have a choice.  I still don't like it as much as Chipotle, but it's a nice change once in a while.

This place is just ok.  Had fun drinking and signing karaoke, but service is a bit slow.  Margaritas are weak and overpriced.  Nachos were bland.  Fried pickles were good!  Haven't tried any entrees yet.  I'd go back with friends, just because it's close to our house, but I wouldn't just go for dinner or anything.

What can I say that others haven't.  Great gelato, plain and simple.  Line wasn't too when we went but I've seen it out the door many a time.  Seems to go fast unless you have people in front of you wanting to sample every flavor.

Came here with my mom who was visiting from out of town.  After a day of shopping, she offered to treat me to a pedicure.  I don't get my nails done very often, so I don't have a regular nail salon....so I checked yelp. After reading a lot of bad reviews for different chandler nail spots, I came across delightful nails.  People had such good things to say about this place, so I called and made an appt. for 20 minutes later.  They did a great job.  We got the luxury pedicure which includes a leg and foot massage and sugar scrub.  It was just fabulous.  The girls were friendly and fun to talk to.  We had a great time and my toes turned out great.!

The BF and I have been here several times now...always on a Sunday afternoon.  We love the patio!  The BF loves that they have Alaskan amber, and their margaritas are quite good too!  We've only eaten appetizers, but all have been good!  Ashton has been our server the past couple of times, and she's just great!  I definitely recommend this place.  :-)

Boy has Distrito gone downhill.  We had been there on two other occasions before our visit last night.  I was suprised to see that I hadn't written a review from our very first visit (which was almost 2 years ago now), because we had such an amazing dinner that time.  We had the Chef's tasting menu, recommended by our server and we were blown away!  I believe it was $50 a person and the food never stopped coming!  We had to have tried at least 10 different dishes from apps to salads to entrees.  We raved about or meal to everyone we knew.  Last night we were excited to have the chef's tasting menu again.  They now offer a 2 course for $45 or 3 course for $55.  We decided on the 2 course because based on the last time we figured we'd be full by dessert.  So, about 10 minutes later out come two dishes.  The small order of Esquites (corn salad) (which is on the menu for $6), and the Chilango Chop Salad ($9).  Both were really good, although the Esquites was really oily.  The corn was literally swimming in the mayo/butter sauce, but the flavor was good.  We purposefully didn't eat everything because we knew a lot more food was coming!  So they cleared the dishes away and about 10 minutes later two more plates came out.  A small piece of Carne Asada ($28) on a plate with a smear of refried beans and a little bowl of red rice on the side, and 3 mushroom tacos (not on the menu but $9 at the most).  So my first thought was that I don't care for mushrooms.  But the tacos were surprisingly good and didn't even taste like mushrooms!  Phew.  My second thought though was that these were entrees.  I started thinking "is this the last of it?"  We finished the two dishes and after a bit we realized that they were in fact the last two dishes we would be getting.  So I quickly do the math.  6+9+28+9=$52.  So, we were supposed to pay $90 for $52 worth of food?  Were we missing something?  I think one of the employees (not sure what his role was)  noticed the confused look on my face because he came over and asked if everything was ok.  So I asked him why we just got $52 worth of food for something they charge $45 per person for.  He explained that he wasn't really sure how it worked but it seemed as if we were only served one person's worth of food and that he would go talk to the chef and find out.  A few minutes later our server came back out and apologized for the confusion and told us that one of the meals was removed from the check.  I'm still unclear of what the "confusion" was.  Were we really only served a tasting menu for one or did they actually think we wouldn't notice that we were paying $90 for $52 worth of food?    I'll add that the place was DEAD.  Three other tables in the whole restaurant between 7-8:30pm on a Friday night.  Not good.  So, needless to say, we will not be going back.  Disappointing because we really did like this place.

I really like this place!  The first time we ate in.  Split a bottle of wine and ordered the white pizza.  It was very good.  Craig, our server, was really friendly and very attentive.  The next time we ordered pizza's for pick up and Craig took my order over the phone.  Once again, super friendly and nice to talk to.  I'll definitely be back!

Stopped in for lunch today.  Loved the decor and patio.  Clean, bright and comfy chairs.  Service was a bit on the slow side.  A server came out after about 5 minutes and introduced himself, but then another server came and told him that she didn't think that was his table so he left....and then about 5 minutes later a different server came out and took our drink order.  The longest wait was from when we were seated to us getting our first drink.  After that things came out much more quickly.  That said.....drinks were good.  Margaritas were strong and only $3 dollars during happy hour which is apparently all day.  We had the tableside guacamole which was really good.  It was also Taco Tuesday so all tacos are $2.50 instead of $3.50.  I tried the napolitas (sp) which was ok.  It kind of tasted like green beans to me.  A bit on the bland side.  I also had the smoked salmon with mango taco.  That was good, but in my opinion it would have been better with un-smoked salmon.  The mango on it really helped freshen it up though.  My cousin has a burrito and she said it was great and as for the sauce that was on top....well, she wanted to lick it off her plate.  Enough said.  We also shared the flan which, although I am not an expert on flan or anything as I've only had a bite of it a couple of times, it was really, really good.  All in all, I'll definitely go back.

We kind of ended up here by mistake.  We wanted to go to Four Peaks but didn't realize this wasn't it until we were inside, so we stayed anyway.  It was quite busy for a Saturday at 3pm, and a service was slow.  We ordered two appetizers when we placed our drink order and then placed our food order when our drinks came out.  About 20 minutes later out came our appetizers...with our food, and an apology from the manager.  Something about our appetizers order getting lost.  Anyway, they took the apps off our bill, so that was good.  Had the mozzarella sticks and the queso and chips.  Both were pretty yummy. I had the blackened fish tacos which were ok...nothing great.  The flour tortillas they use are WAY too big though.  I had to tear a good inch off the top, and the fish filet inside didn't even reach the ends of the tacos.  Everyone else had burgers, and they said they were good.  All in all, not horrible, but I don't see us going back...not when there are so many other restaurants nearby.  My 3 teenage boys thoroughly enjoyed the scantily dressed waitresses though.  My one son said "this place shouldn't be called a brewery, it should be called a boobery!". Too funny.  (this place is not a brewery, but we had told them were we're going to four peaks).

Yes, we've lived here for 5 1/2 years and just finally tried Postino.  We went on a sunny, somewhat warm December afternoon and sat in a couple of comfy lounge chairs by the open doors.  The ambiance was great, service was great....almost too great.  A different server literally stopped and asked us if we were doing ok every 5 minutes.  I like it though.  We'll definitely be going back.

I can't say enough great things about Rob and I Clean Carpets!  His communication is superb.  When I first called I had to leave a message and then I didn't get a call back that day.  When I woke in the morning there was a text from Rob apologizing for not getting back to me.  He got home very late from his last job and said he's call me first thing in the morning, which he did.  When he called back he gave me a great price on the phone (and that was the price I ended up paying).  Said he'd be out between 1-3 and he said it should be closer to 1pm.  The night before he texted me to let me know that it would now be closer to 3 and said he didn't want me waiting around from 1pm.  Very nice of him.  Then he called me as he was leaving the appt before mine to let me know his ETA.  So great!  He arrived and took a quick walk around to house to see what room he'd be cleaning.  He helped move the rest of the furniture we wanted moved and explained his process.  Then he proceeded to work his magic.  Our carpets look fabulous!  Last time we used OxyFresh and we thought they looked great too, but a couple days later they looked dirty again.  Not the case with Rob.  We are truly amazed at how good our carpets look.  He even cleaned a small area rug by the front door.....for free!  He's a one man show, and he truly takes pride in his work.  He followed up the next day to see if we were satisfied with the job done.  I will use no one but him to clean our carpets from now on.  Thanks Rob!

I'm sorry to say that I do not agree with the other two reviews.  We stopped at this place to grab a drink and appetizer because we had some time to kill before meeting some friends, and the place looked cute as we were driving by. Service was extremely slow.  Despite all the empty tables on the patio when we came in, we were told 10-15 minutes for a table outside.  We did only wait about 5, but then we waited almost 10 minutes for our server to greet us and take our drink order.  We ordered a beer, a margarita, and chips, salsa and guacamole, and 2 waters with lemon.  5 minutes later the water comes out....without lemon.  Server says she's going to go get our drinks and I ask for lemons also.  She's off, and I take a sip of my water.  Yuck!  Worst water I've ever had at a restaurant, so five minutes later when she brings our drinks and the lemon, I don't even use it because no amount of lemon is going to get rid of the dirt taste in the water.  So now we finally have our drinks and she says our chips and salsa should be up soon.  5 minutes later we get our chips and salsa and guacamole.  What can I say....it tasted like chips, salsa and guacamole.  The whole place just felt kind of lame and depressing.  Staff didn't have much personality.  Overall we were just unimpressed.

We finally tried this place for Happy Hour and I was not disappointed!  $4.50 happy hour margs were tasty and potent.  The chips and salsas were very good.  Green one was nice and refreshing, and the warm one had a nice kick to it.  The bartender was very attentive and friendly.  Let us sample their frozen margarita too.  The BF had the steak tacos which he said were great.  I ordered the crab cakes and the crawfish hushpuppies.  The crab cakes were really good, nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Beautifully presented.  The hushpuppies were sooo good!  At first I thought they were really greasy because they were shiny and what I thought was oil, was puddled in the bottom of the plate.  It turned out it was some sort of sweet stuff drizzled over them, and there was a salsa on the side too.  The sweetness combined with the spicy salsa was just great!  I thoroughly enjoyed them and even though I was full after about 3 of them, I kept eating until they were all gone.  Yum yum.  All in all, I left with a buzz and a full belly.  We'll definitely go back!

I had heard good things about Mellow Mushroom, but my experience left much to be desired.  We went on a Saturday night around 7:15 with a party of 6.  The place was not busy at all, yet they seated us upstairs all by ourselves.  It took forever to get our Margaritas (which were a steep $9.50 for a small glass mostly filled with ice).  The Bruschetta and Artichoke Dip were ok, but the pizza was horrible.  We got the Kosmic Karma and there was sooooo much sauce, that's all we tasted....and it was really expensive.  I've had better frozen pizzas for a fraction of the price.  What a was of money.  Will never go back.

Just gave this spot a try for a couple of drinks and an appetizer...and I'm looking forward to going back for an actual meal!  Great bar, nice decor, friendly and helpful staff.  I had the sangria which was really good.  Also had the green chile black bean dip.  Super yummy....but I am a huge fan of black beans.  The outside patio looks really nice and they have live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  Definitely will be back!

I don't go to this location very often, but every time I do I have a good experience.  What more does one need to say about Chipotle.  Yummy!

Had some time to kill before a meeting up the road, so we ducked into Nook for drinks and an early dinner.  Great little place.  Nice decor, friendly staff, great food!  It was happy hour so I had a glass of Cabernet and we ordered the hummus plate off the HH menu.  It was really good.  A nice combo of veggies, pita, hummus, and tzatziki, along with some fried chickpeas.  It was a great start to our meal.  We then shared the Giardino pizza.  It was fabulous!  Great crust, lots of veggies, and a modest amount of their house pulled mozzarella.  Delish!  Will definitely stop in again next time we're in the area.

What a great veggie burger!  I am glad so many restaurants are offering a veggie burger now, but so many leave much to be desired.  Not the case with BurgerFi.  Probably one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had.  Fresh, tasty, and very much like a regular burger (although it has been a really long time since I've had a real burger).  Fries and onion rings were also very good.  Friendly, prompt service and clean restaurant.  I will definitely go back.

Great little Thai place!  I love that they give you fresh rolls instead of crispy spring rolls with the lunch entrees.  The Pad See Ew (my go to dish) was fabulous!  I ordered medium hot and it was spicy, but not too spicy.  I'm looking forward to going back!

I had been to the other Blanco location a few years ago, but we only had drinks and apps.  This time I had the chipotle shrimp tacos and they were A-MAZ-ING!  Can't wait to get back there and have them again.

Food was great!  My Pad See Ew was perfect!  The fresh spring rolls and peanut dipping sauce were really good too.  The service was not great.  Not the servers fault....she was the only one, along with a busser.  A different girl brought our drinks and food out but she informed us she was just helping out her friend.  One server for the 9 or so tables that were there is just not enough.  Never got asked if we needed anything else or another drink.  Maybe they were short staffed so I'm not holding it against them.  Cute decor....nice bathrooms.  Will definitely go back and give it another try.

Loved this place!  I went with my BF, and my mom who was visiting from Chicago.  Great decor, great service, great menu, great outdoor seating!  Oh, and most importantly, great food!  My mom and I shared the veggie and hummus sandwich and the tofu protein bowl with sweet potato hash.  The sandwich was delicious!  The bread was a little on the soft side, so next time I think I'll try it as a wrap.  Taste was great though.  The bowl was equally yummy.  We also had the stevia sweetened lemonade.  I never order lemonade anywhere because it's either loaded with sugar, or artificial sweetener.  Loved having lemonade with my meal!  My BF had the tri-tip sandwich and a Devil's ale.  He loved his sandwich although he did think the bread was a little too soft too.  Nothing a fork can't fix though.  We sat on the side patio and it was just perfect.  I can't wait to go back and try some of the salads and juices!

Finally gave this place a try on a Friday night.  We were seated right away, but it took about 5 minutes for our server to approach us.  The BF's attempts to order a beer didn't go so well.  Every beer he ordered off the beer list, they didn't have.  Finally settled for a Kirin I think.  We ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer.  They came out still cold in the middle which means they're cooked from frozen.  We sent them back, but our food was out before we got another order of spring rolls.  My Pad See Ew was pretty good, but the BF didn't care for his Thai Fried Rice.  He thought it was very bland.  The second set of spring rolls were still barely warm in the middle.  With so many great Thai places around, I doubt we'll be back to this one.

Update:  Visit on 4/29/16:  I don't know what happened since we first came here a week ago, but it's as if we walked into a different restaurant.  No one greeted us at the door with a smile.  No one said anything as we sat at the bar for 10 minutes.  The bartender (or the woman who was behind the bar) was speaking with other patrons when we sat down.  We she finished she just walked past us without a word, or a look, or anything.  As we sat and I looked around I made eye contact several times with another woman (not sure if she was a server or hostess or manager or what) but she just went on her way without acknowledging we were there.  The woman who was originally behind the bar cam back to the bar register, but still.....nothing.  Then she left and proceeded to set a table (or maybe she was bussing a table) behind us in the near empty restaurant.  Not like they needed to get that table ready because there was a line of people waiting.  There were though, two hungry and thirsty customers sitting at the bar.  A couple minutes later when she returned to the bar area to bring the gentlemen to our right their check, we thought relieved "ok, she'll come take our order now".  Fat chance.  She walked right by us again.  Like we were invisible.  That's when we got up to leave.  The bar woman saw us getting up and for the first time actually looked at us.  The BF called her over and told her exactly why we were leaving. That she was why we were leaving. Then she said smiling "ok, well have a nice day".  Really?  The whole situation was just surreal.  The whole vibe in there was different.  No one looked happy.  Certainly not happy that we were there.  Well, they don't have to worry because we will not be back.  I can't believe we thought this was going to be a new favorite spot.  Very disappointing.  Visit on 4/23/16:  What a great place!  From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, we felt right at home.  The guy that greeted us at the door was smiling and friendly and told us about all the different seating options and asked where we would like to sit.  We sat at the bar, which was nice and roomy.  The chairs weren't crammed together like at so many other restaurants.  Kacee, the bartender, was just great.  Friendly and attentive.  She gave us great recommendations for our meals and we were never left sitting with an empty glass.  The food was amazing.  I had the roasted vegetable salad.  Seriously one of the best salads I've ever had.  The BF had the smoked chicken rigatoni which he said was amazing.  We both finished every last morsel.  We finished by sharing a chocolate mousse cake....also fabulous.  The only thing I didn't care for was the smoked butter that comes with the complimentary bread.  I though it tasted weird...but that's ok because I treated myself to dessert instead of chowing down the whole bread basket. The BF liked it though.  Anyway, so happy we found this cute neighborhood spot.  The decor is lovely and they have a cute outdoor patio too which we'll have to check out next time.  Definitely a new favorite!

I bought a livingsocial deal for a dinner for 2 for $50.  Includes 2 beers, 2 large sakes, sushi roll of your choice, edamame, and two entrees (choice of 5 different ones).  I then discovered after checking out the specials on their website that they offer this same deal on Thursday nights...the date night special.  Good to know.  Anyway, overall a great dinner.  I had the calamari entree though and thought it was a bit bland.  Everything else was fabulous though.  We will definitely be taking advantage of that date night special in the near future.

We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and grabbed a seat at the outdoor bar.  It wasn't a crazy hot day and with the fan they had going outside, it was very pleasant.  Turned out Sunday is all day Happy Hour.  Woohoo!  Had some house margs, street corn queso, and the brussel sprout nachos (after the bartender said they were the best nachos he's ever had).  OMG...they were soooo good!  Incredibly rich, but so good.  Great food, great service.  Can't ask for more than that.  We'll definitely be back.

After reading other peoples negative reviews I was thinking "Wow, some people are very picky about their pizza!"  Well, I guess I am one of those people because this pizza was awful.  We ordered a Margherita and it was just not good.  Burnt spots on the bottom, barely no cheese, a tasteless tomato sauce, and it was super thin and bendy.  I tried folding it in half but then the first thing I tasted was the burnt stuff on the bottom.  We also got the garlic rotolis.  No where near as good as the garlic knots I've eaten at a dozen other pizza joints.  They tasted like they were made from canned Pillsbury dough and there was hardly and seasoning on them.  The Bruschetta was decent tasting, but hard to eat because the bread was really soft and when you attempted to pick up a piece it folded inwards and all the tomato topping and the tons of excess juice just squished out all over.  It was like Italian Sushi because you have to cram the whole entire thing in your mouth at one time.  The one thing that kept me from giving this place one star were the wings.  I myself did not eat any buy the guys LOVED them.  They're oven baked in that 1000 degree coal oven.  Burns pizza but makes great wings I guess.  Anyway, I probably won't go back but the BF and his buddy will probably find their way over there for the wings again.

We tried this place out for Happy Hour and we were not impressed.  Service was spotty, house margs were weak, we had to ask for chips and salsa and when we finished the small amount brought to us, we were never asked if we wanted more.  I tried the tamale pie corn fritters.  They were uncooked in the middle and lacked flavor.  We also got the papas locas which are cheese fries.  The description says cheddar, but it was actually a cheese sauce and the fries were drenched in it.  The fries were mushy, and not just because of the enormous amount cheese sauce.  The BF got the chicken sliders which he said were "ok".  Nothing about this place makes me look forward to going back...so we probably won't.

Great place!  Been twice now.  Had the beet salad both times.  Soooo good!  Had the fried pickles too.  They were great.  Really thin with a light batter.  Different than any other fried pickles I've had.  Service was great both times.  Definitely recommend!

I had always wanted to try Indian food, and really wanted to try a buffet so I could sample a lot of different dishes, but most restaurants that have a buffet are not vegetarian so most of the dishes would have been off limits for me.  Not the case with Ruchi!  An entire buffet of vegetarian food!  It was like a dream.  I tried almost everything...and everything was really good!  The young guy that served us, was so nice and helpful, and after telling him it was my first time eating Indian food, he explained what things were, what chutneys go with what, and how things are generally eaten.  I really can't wait to go back!

Yummy sangria, amazing food!  The shrimp and eggplant appetizer was incredible!  I had it for my meal along with the Ivy fries, which were equally great.  Nice ambiance and service.  My only complaint was that it was sooooo cold inside!  I didn't dress for the outside weather but they had all the doors and windows around the bar area open so it seemed as cold inside as it was out.  I survived by warming my hands over the little candle on our table.  I'm looking forward to going back....I'll just dress warmer next time.

We really enjoyed this place!  Nice bar area, inside and out.  It was too cold for us to sit outside at the bar so we sat inside.  Great service from the bartender.  The BF and I shared the 4 cheese white pizza with added pesto and it was soooo good!  We also got these little fried dough strips off the HH menu, but I'd skip those next time.  Everything's a bit pricey, but it was so good I'm not complaining.  Looking forward to going back when the weather is nicer and sitting on the outside patio.

Loved this little place!  We stumbled upon it accidentally while looking for somewhere to eat near the 10.  My friend and I are vegetarian, but our SO's are not.  We saw this place and for some reason my Yelp search made me think is was a mexican place that was not at all vegetarian friendly.  What a nice surprise to find that it was entirely vegetarian!  We had several different entree's.  The street corn (I didn't care for it myself as the corn was really overcooked and hard to eat), the Monte Vista Torta (very good...with yummy baked fries), the Chili and Cornbread (also very good....almost as good as the chili and cornbread I make at home ;-), and the Goat Cheese Quesadilla with Jalapeno Marmalade (the star of the meal...we even ordered a second to share!)  I also had an Evergreen cocktail.  Basically a spicy margarita.  So good, but it was spicy!  Everyone who worked there was so nice and helpful.  Even the owner/chef came out and talked to us.  We ate outside on the porch (yes porch....don't see those too often around here).  I wish it was closer to Chandler so we could eat there more often.

I've been back two times since my initial review and my Pad See Ew was AMAZING both times! Not dry, perfectly cooked broccoli, perfect amount of heat.  I find myself craving it now.  I got the lunch special the other day and it's only $5.99!  Even the dinner portion is only $7.99.  Amazing prices for the quality of food.  Service amazing as always.  Even got the BF to try it despite them not serving beer, and he loved it as well.  Everyone is so nice there and they take a lot of pride in their restaurant.  Can't wait to go back.

No pad see ew on the lunch menu (my go to dish) so I ended up ordering off the regular menu.  Ordered medium heat which was quite hot for medium, but exactly the heat level I was looking for.  Enough to make me sweat, but not so hot I couldn't taste my food.  Very small place...not seating on the first floor so we sat in the loft area.  Kind of weird way up there....and warm.  Waited a long time for our check so we ended up leaving cash on the table after a rough calculation of what our bill would be.  Might go back if I'm in the area again, but won't make a special trip since there are plenty of other equally good or better Thai place near my house.  Besides, no alcohol = no go for the BF.  He just needs that ice cold beer with his Thai hot dish.

I just love Pita Jungle!  First time to this location and I was surprised to see some different items on the menu.  I was especially happy to see the Cilantro Hummus with Red Quinoa as a regular menu item because at Gilbert location this is a special once in a while and I always order it when it is.  That said, this location was great!  Nice decor, great service.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was so nice.  He let me sample different wines and then when we told him that we wouldn't be boxing up our leftovers because we were going to be walking around the art festival for a couple hours, he told us he could put it in his fridge and we could pick it up when we were headed home.  I've never had a restaurant say they could hold on to our leftovers before.  Food was amazing as always.  Will be back for sure.
