I was referred by a friend to this Desert Rat store. Shawn who is the Manager took great care of me about 6 months ago when I had my jeep lifted. All the staff there are super nice and very knowledgeable. They make you feel comfortable and are not trying to sell you something you don't need. They are family owned which makes all the difference. And they recently donated their time and gave away free merchandise to help raise money for a sick boy and his family and even put together a trail ride called "RYDERS RUN" I can go on and on but if you are thinking of lifting your vehicle then this is the place. And there not cocky like 4 wheel parts and will not rip you off. They are very honest and do great work. That's why I gave them 5 stars.  Mike

Well, I must say I agree with Jeff T. regarding Cassandra Shore as far as wanting to make money on co-pays etc. I normally see Dr John Kwon but when I made an appointment to see him he was not available and maybe on vacation so they had me see Dr Shore.   It appeared I had an ingrown hair and since it wasn't healing I thought maybe I needed an anitbiotic to prevent it from getting any worse. Once Dr Shore looked at it she said it should heal. She said if it didn't get better with in couple days to come back to see her. After leaving the office I thought to myself why didn't she just give the antibiotic. I figured shit, she's a Dr so she must know better then me, right?    A couple days went by and it appeared worse and definitely not better. So I went back to the Dr Office and they asked me to pay another $20.00 co-pay. I argued with the  office manager over it saying why should I pay you another co-pay when the Dr said to come back if it wasn't getting better!? Its for the same problem. The office manager just said because my insurance requires a co-pay. I asked her if I was having stitches removed would you require another co-pay? She said no that's different. I said its for the same problem and were talking 3 days! I then explained to the manager that all I need is an antibiotic, so can you just ask the Dr to call in a perscription for me? She said just a minute and went to talk to Dr Shore. She came back and said no, she has to see you. So I really had no choice but to pay the $20.00 co-pay but asked if she could bill me for it and she said NO. So I paid the co-pay and was seen again by Dr Shore.   I was in the room for like 1-2 minutes before she says yes you need an antibiotic. I said to myself, NO SHIT LADY! I TRIED TO TELL YOU ALL THAT! Obviously they just wanted to make more money off my insurance and myself. So as I walked out of the room Dr Shore apologized for having to see me again. I sincerely believe It was superficial and I said to Dr Shore and the office Manager, "For twenty dollars you just lost a patient and earned a bad review." They didn't say anything. You would think they would say something. I mean if I ran an office or was the owner etc the last thing I would want is a negative review or an unhappy client. I would at least talk with them and try and resolve it.   Bottom line is that office is out to make the money not caring about their patients. I have nothing bad to say about Dr Kwon as I have seen him approximately 2 times total. He was very knowledgeable and nice. However it is his office and if that's how he chooses to run it and allow his staff and Dr Shore to lie and deceive patients then he is just as bad. I will never go there again. If I had read a review like Jeff T. prior then I never would have even gone to that office in the first place. I do wonder if Dr Kwon even knows whats going on in his own office or maybe he just doesn't care and is like all of them. JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.

Hi again! Apparently the review below which I wrote on August 9th 2013 and also place it on the DR's website for reviews mysteriously disappeared from the DR's website. Who knows how many other reviews he deleted. As of today is when I checked it just after receiving a letter from DR Kwon saying they will no longer see me. The letter was a waist of time and paper as I already made it very clear to them that I was switching Dr's. I'm glad I also placed my original review on YELP which is where I saw Jeff's review. The Dr may be able to erase his bad reviews on his website, but not on YELP!   http://www.vitals.com/doctors/Dr_John_Kwon/reviews#ixzz2ciZnds5R  Doctor Reviews and Ratings  Follow us: @Vitals on Twitter | Vitals on Facebook

Hello ALL,   I first ate at Zzeeks Pizza about 2 years ago when a good friend Marian referred my Fiance and I to it saying it was the best pizza in town. Little did I know my kids had already been there with their mom prior to me knowing about it and loved it as well.   So we tried it and loved it. They have the best ranch dressing as well. Since then we have gone inside to eat and order delivery. The best thing about Zzeeks is they are family owned and very customer friendly to everyone. There was a time or two where they delivered and forgot the ranch dressing and because it was their mistake, they brought us another cheesy bread for free without us even asking. The owner said it was our mistake and we wanted you to have fresh cheesy bread as well. If you ever have a problem they will take good care of you with no hassle. Great people and great service. If you havent tried Zzeeks then you are missing out! Also what place do you know where the owner sometimes personally delivers to your home. I honestly can't say enough good things about these great people.  THANKS AGAIN ZZEEKS, KEEP UP THE GREAT SERVICE!!!! :)  Sencerely,  Mike and Jordan Knowles
