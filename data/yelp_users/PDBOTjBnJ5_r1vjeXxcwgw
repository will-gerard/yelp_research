This place has seriously bomb burgers. On top of that yes, their fries are just as tasty.  This little gem may not look impressive from the outside located in the middle of a strip off of Lindsay Rd by Broadway but inside is cozy with an old diner feel to it.  I love to support local businesses, especially those ones with the same smiling faces behind the counter cooking and serving.  Don't miss this place if you're looking for a cheeseburger to hit the spot.  Keep it up, Giant Hamburgers! You're definitely doing something right.

My grandma and I walked in to a line of 7-8 people waiting to be seated.  Customers were talking among themselves and to us about how they weren't sure how long the wait was because no one greeted them and surveyed the many empty tables available. One group of folks walked out after waiting. April finally came by after 5 or 10 minutes and seated the growing line.  When it was our turn, April didn't once make eye contact with us. Not even after reaching our table and seating us.  I figured maybe she was stressed out or busy... But still. That really set the mood.   I don't remember our waitresses name. But I can tell you that she wasn't all that concerned with us for at least another 10 minutes. When she did visit our table, she was very unenthused about it and made me feel like she must have been waitressing for 20+ years... and is just sick of it.  Grandma and I both decided on soup and salad.  Butternut squash soup looked like my grandma was eating baby food. Gross! Consistency, color, taste, everything. My tortilla chicken soup was slopped all around my bowl, there was more tortilla chips than soup... And the tortilla soup wasn't even tasty. Just bad.  Our waitress did not seem concerned that we didn't eat much at all of our soup as she brought out our salads. Even after I told her mine was just awful, I get a "alright, do you want something else?" And that was that. Uh, no I don't.   We got up to leave after about 20-30 seconds of investigating our salads for traces of chicken. Mine had NONE and hers had a whopping 3 pieces.  Caesar salad was practically glued together by thick dressing and sprinkled with breadcrumbs or something.   We waited politely at the cashiers counter (which is where you take your bill to pay) to inform someone that we were leaving. Caroline wasn't our waitress, but arrived and appeared genuinely upset by our experience and asked us if she could please wait on us in her section. Poor girl had no idea what we'd been through (not to mention the layer of dust covering the place).  She insists on bringing the manager over... Only to find out that it was April: the first gal who sat us at our table.   The only thing Coco's has going for it is Caroline.  She was empathetic and professional.  Caroline: get a serving job somewhere more your speed (meaning better).   Yelpers: OMG RUN FOR THE HILLS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PAY A DIME FOR THIS CRAP AND LEFT HUNGRY.

V.I. Auto repair is as good as it gets if you're looking for an honest mechanic.  When I first needed a repair but wasn't sure exactly what was wrong, I called around to 4 other auto mechanics in the Phoenix area to get estimations for what I thought was wrong.  By the time I made my last call trying to "shop around" to V.I., I was relieved to have not been transferred to someone else.  I explained what I thought was wrong and some other estimations to see if they could give me a better price... Not only did they nearly cut everyone else's estimate in half but promised to stay open after hours for me so I could have my repair done immediately.    As a girl in her early 20's, I never have to worry about getting taken advantage of anymore because I refuse to see any other mechanic even after moving to Mesa. The drive is worth it.

I am a huge fan of this donut shop.  I work nearby and stop in once a week for a coffee and a freshly baked donut because I simply can't help myself... The donuts are made every morning by the owner (who is a fellow Michigander!) and he is the type of small business owner who gives you the service and the product that makes you want to support him.  He even makes the Boston creme filling in his donuts from scratch!  If only the rest of his service staff was as genuinely kind and neighborly as he is when it's bright and early just after he's just finished baking his daily batch of product... But hey.  This shop also serves Thrifty brand ice cream.  Gotta love that for creative dessert endeavors, especially in the summer after a long shift if I can catch it before it closes at 5 on weekdays.   America doesn't have to live on Dunkin! Local family owned businesses ftw.

I've been going to this restaurant for at least 3 years now.  I typically always get the Vermecilli noodle, #42 to be exact, and am never disappointed.  Be careful with the fish sauce you get on the side, though.  You can really overdo it if carelessly dump it into your bowl.   When I'm sick, I'll change it up and go with a beef combination Pho.  The food here is always fresh, and the family who owns the place is very friendly and remembers me (and my order) every time I come back.  If you're new to Vietnamese, just ask the waitress what she recommends for you. She'll help you pick out dishes that don't have strange parts of beef, tripe, or other things that the average cheeseburger eater would be grossed out by.  Every other Pho restaurant I've tried hasn't compared in the slightest to my favorite Pho Nhat in University and Rural!

This restaurant has service issues.  My fiancé and I decided to re-try this place for breakfast after our first visit together over a year ago. (The first time, service AND food were so bad we vowed never to return.) I used to come in every now and again a long time ago and enjoyed their grandma's homely atmosphere and classic cooking... But I'm so upset by my last two visits because I WANT to like this place.   Here's what happened: my fiancé and I are in no rush, and wait close to 10 minutes at the front if the restaurant where a sign states "please wait to be seated."  The waitress acknowledged us, but took care of a few tables delivering food and tabs before seating us. We observed a nearly full restaurant with 2 servers, 1 busser, no host... And who we assumed was the manager. We immediately assumed that they were understaffed.  This is when it gets bad. We overhear a customer checking out ask if they were hiring, to which the server replied that they were not hiring and the manager just hired on several on call servers. Uh, where are they? Because now is the time to call them in, yo.  We were "seated" by someone pointing at our table and walking away.  Unwelcoming and unprofessional.  My fiancé ordered a breakfast burro and I ordered a half order of biscuits and gravy with eggs and hash browns. Food was good, especially the burrito. That's where the compliments end...  Both of us ordered coffee. Every time the other waitress came to our table to refill our cup, she did so so quickly and sloppily that my cup was wet, the table around it, and eventually the rest of the booth next to me too. The bus boy took more care than the female server pouring my coffee! Oh, and I know what you're thinking... How many cups of coffee was I served? Upwards of 5 or 6... Because after our food was gone and our plates picked up we sat at our table watching other families who sat down 20 minutes after us receive their checks. We were still served coffee?  We need our server and our check. My fiancé had to ask for our check to the wind behind the waitress passing us... TWICE for our tab.  What did she do? She took care of the table behind us who arrived after us. We watched her, looked her dead in the eye, and then received our bill a few minutes later without eye contact or an apology.  My fiancé and I felt honestly prejudged for looking young enough to be teenagers. Do we deserve bad service because you expect us not to tip?  We were ignored or received less than mediocre service. Maybe they should consider retraining their servers. We left so mad, the food can't convince us to return for a 3rd try.

Supporting local business and grubbing on some seriously bomb Mexican food is what I'm all about. This place is great.  Friendly service, great food, convenient location. Moreno's is my new hometown pride food truck stop because Filiberto's is overrated in my book these days. Moreno will give me my classic burro in carne asada to pollo to lengua... Check it out! This spot is a worthy Mexican spot

Took my boyfriend to Lucille's for his birthday last week and we still can't stop talking about how bomb the smoked BBQ ribs were.  Fried okra was awesome, stellar beer selection (highly recommend the house summer brew), and they have wings that compete too.  The apple butter and rolls though wasn't a winner for me, but why fill up on that when you come for the BBQ?  A little pricey, but you get what you pay for!

A sake bomb for $6.50 can't be beat, but $3 blue moon on tap keeps me a regular here.  While the service can be spotty due to their high turnover on waitstaff... Their Chinese food will have you doing all your take out from Zushi.  If you are a stickler about good service though, you may want to request that William wait on you.   My favorite Chinese dish is by far the General Tsao's beef (I ask for shrimp in mine too, so worth it), and if you're going for sushi the best salmon roll is the Sunny Beaches.  If you can dig on eel, ask for the Power Roll: Shrimp tempura inside and eel on top. Its not on the menu anymore but they will still make it and you're cool like me, add cream cheese to it too! They are very accommodating.

At 8:40 am after dropping the hubby off at MCC for class across the street, I was just looking for a place to chill for an hour.  I saw the big "COFFEE" sign from Southern and thought Eureka!  Uh, they were closed. The door and windows outside display a lot but not their hours of business and Yelp claims that this place opens at 7am (as they should, if not earlier with it being a coffee establishment).   Waiting outside confused, another customer approaches the door and I decided to ask him if he had been here before. He hadn't, and we noticed people inside. I knocked and waved an employee over who told us that they don't open until 9am. Well, my fellow coffee consumer left for Starbucks and I nearly went with him. I only stayed because I wanted to write this review.   Coffee isn't that great anyway, but that's the only thing I purchased. They won't serve it to you by French press either.   One last thing: the gal who served me was polite but uninformed. She didn't know how much a coffee refill was and had to ask the older gal working. (Refills are 1/2 the $ of your drink, btw...) The older lady decided to pour my coffee while the other took my payment but interrupted her twice asking how I take my coffee. She could have just looked at me and asked, instead of insisting that she tell her that I take it just black. Lady left plenty of room for cream regardless.   Karma's a B sometimes.

One star, because 0 stars isn't an option.   Every other 1 star review will have the same sad tale of fried tasteless fish squares that don't come with tarter sauce.  Tartar is an extra fee... You get Pirate sauce instead. Pirate sauce is the weakest watery version of the red sauce you get from a Filly B's.  The fries don't even give this place something to save face.  Honestly? My boyfriend and I went thinking it was a Pete's fish and chips and we were craving it so badly we decided that Pirate's should do the trick.  We were gravely mistaken. I repeat: DO NOT TRUST PIRATES WITH YOUR FISH OR YOUR CHIPS. THEY WILL RUIN THEM, THEN THEY WILL RUIN YOU.  Shame on us for not checking Yelp before we let this place rob is out of $15 dollars and a tasty dinner.

I live a mere 5 minute walk from this poor excuse for a bar and grill.  I've been back more than once out of convenience only.  I still don't understand why I literally get ignored at the bar.  I always have to ask for service after a good 10 minutes of sitting and staring at the sometimes multiple bartenders.  They have 2 pool tables inside which is usually why my boyfriend and I come at all and if they're full, I leave.  Food is mediocre, wings are chewy.  Just keep driving by, this place is just bound to disappoint.

No. Just no. Officially boycotting this place out of respect for myself. Met up my man and his sister right after I got off work for a drink. I was really looking forward to a beer after a stressful day, didn't care where I got my drink... Just wanted to relax and ask my husband how his day was. Not one bartender or server who passed by picking up empty glasses from other patrons even looked at me.  For 20 minutes. I know it was 20 minutes because I watched my clock, expecting slow service, but didn't assume I'd get none whatsoever. The bartenders are clearly not trained or simply don't care about customers that aren't their regulars even though the bar wasn't even half full. Maybe with some training or some new employees they would have noticed that I had been staring at them walk by, desperate for acknowledgement.   I'm sorry, but I'm just not the type of customer who says "excuse me, can I get some service please?" I don't like sending food back and I don't like tipping when a bad waitress less than 15%. It makes me uncomfortable.  To the manager of Jj Madison's: your front of house ESPECIALLY your bartenders are losing you business because at this point I will deter anyone who says they're going to this place by begging them to go literally anywhere else thanks to how they have not once, not twice, but 3 times ignored their local clientele.

I've been recommending and coming here for a few years just for the fish tempura tacos.  I've rarely tried anything else because they're that delicious. Their  $1.50 Taco Tuesday special would put me here every Tuesday forever if I were filthy rich. Enough said.

I fully expected this experience to be a disaster as a walked into this David's Bridal location for my appointment.  My best friend chose DB for her bridesmaids dresses because I live across the country and after several atrocious experiences in Novi, Michigan I felt just terrible that my best friend, let alone any bride should have to deal with anything but top notch customer service.   I only wish all locations were as fantastic as this one. Even though this isn't a full David's Bridal but a boutique with a more limited but refined selection... I have never had better service. From someone with retail background, I expressed my gratitude to Flor, my lovely consultant, by buying my shoes in store that day too just so she could get commission for the sale (I never intended on buying shoes in this store, let alone how much I splurged...)  All bridal shops should give you nothing but a uniquely attentive, kind, personal experience while shopping and I got just that today at the David's Bridal Boutique at the Waterfront in Scottsdale.  When you're calling to make your appointment,  see Flor if you can.

This place is no longer Gus's.  New ownership changed it to NY Pizza and Bar.  Pizza is still pretty good on the right nights and they still have a $5 cheese pizza on happy hour... But there is a high turnover on staff and it seems like the new owner is experimenting with his menu. He took all the yummy Mediterranean dishes off the menu, including the house hummus and made it strictly Italian food... NY style? All I have to say to NY Pizza and bar: good luck competing with Red White and Brew, Pachino's, and Venezia's NY pizza.  :(  My money says this place doesn't last much longer than the other 3 restaurants at this location that failed before this one. Very disappointed; I may not return.

Pacino's is home to my favorite bartender, Billy Zane.  Great happy hour, delicious food, and convincing specials that keep us dropping by just anytime we can find an excuse.  Treat yourself to some meatball sliders or calamari and a Peroni from the tap and you won't be disappointed.
