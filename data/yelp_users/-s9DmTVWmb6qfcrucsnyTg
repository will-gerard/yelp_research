They close earlier than posted hours. We showed up and they claimed it was too slow to stay open...but their Open sign was still on and flashing. Best to call in advance to find out if they feel like closing early.

Had the pleasure of using AAA Auto Repair today. I took my car there for basic service (Lube and Oil) and they completed the service in a timely manner.   The only reason I did not give them a 5 star rating is because of their professionalism. They seemed extremely disorganized with orders and verbally displayed this in front of waiting customers.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this business to a friend. I will update with any future experiences.
