Every Gyro place uses pretty much the same stuff, but their Tsatziki sauce sets them apart.  They use some kind of high end greek yogurt that they sell in their market.  Always quick friendly service and a consistently good meal.   Ask for Tony, the owner, he is a somewhat elderly short Greek guy that has a perpetual smile on his face and responds to everyone as "my friend", "Oh, yes my friend" or "Oh very good my friend" etc. You just can't help but love the guy.

Used to go to the original 20 years ago when I lived in Estrella, and remember it being pretty good family style Mexican food. I had lunch at this location today and recognized a couple servers from way back. The food wasn't as good as I remember and the service was ten times worse. It took around five minutes for anyone to bring water, and a couple minutes later I was asked if I wanted chips. Nobody has ever asked if I want chips at a Mexican restaurant, that's half the reason we are there. Finally a server comes and takes my order and close to 15 minutes later I had two tacos, pretty small and rather greasy. I put a $20 in plain sight on the table and ate my lunch. After playing on my phone for a good ten more minutes a busboy came and grabbed the $20 and went to cash me out. A completely new server brought my change. I quickly left 10% and made my way to the door where half the staff was standing around talking by the register. I may go back to the original for nostalgia sake, but maybe in another 20 years.

I ate at sister restaurant Barrio Cafe a couple years ago and was very impressed with the food.  We went to Barrio Queen today and was very disappointed.  For starters the chips were very thick, and some were chewy as they were not cooked through.  I miss the bread and olive relish served at the cafe.  I had the chicken mole enchiladas, very little chicken, mostly cheese with a good but not great mole sauce.  My kids had black bean burros with rice, the burros were ok but the rice tasted like it was out of a box, no flavor and seemed like an after thought.  Wife had fish and shrimp tacos which she said were flavorful but too small to pick up without falling apart. The service was good but did not make up for the poor cuisine. In my opinion there are way too many excellent choices in this town for mexican food, I sadly will not be going back to Barrio Queen.

I went there around lunch time the other day on the recommendation of a friend.  I had the standard burger with carmelized onion and the short rib taco.  The burger was outstanding, the blend and ratio of chuck/brisket/short rib is spot on.  I opened the wrapper for the taco and there was a huge chunk of meat, quite a lot of protein for a $3 taco.  The flavors were great, but it was a little dry.  Perhaps if they were to shred the meat and mix it with the basting juices?  Overall a great little local joint.  I knocked them down from 5 to 4 stars because of the service.  While the entire staff was very friendly and personable there didn't seem to be much organization resulting in very long wait times inside the restaurant.  It took about ten minutes to get my food after I ordered, when I walked outside the cars in the drive through didn't seem to move much.  I'll definitely go back, but perhaps just not at noon on a Monday.

We took our best friends to Preston's for their birthdays the other night.  Everything from start to finish was perfectly executed and the service was top notch.  I literally can think of nothing negative to say.  We started with the coconut shrimp and the lamb chop fondue along with very innovative cocktails and moved on to wedge salads and the house salads for the ladies.  Delmonico steaks served Oscar style was the main course selection across the table.  All four were ordered to different temps and all came out perfectly.  For dessert we had to have the butter cake which we always enjoyed at sister restaurant Arrowhead Grill and the flourless chocolate cake.  The butter cake is always a crowd pleaser, and the chocolate cake was good, but not the best I have had.  Overall the best steakhouse experience to date.  Even one of our companions who always seems to find a problem with every meal was completely speechless when we left.  Can't wait to go back for my birthday.

We were looking for a house in the Northwest Valley.  Lenny helped us find the exact floor plan we were looking for and negotiated an amazing deal with the sellers.  When it came time to sell, Lenny's aggressive marketing earned us the highest sold price in the neighborhood in just under 2 weeks.  He has proven to be a savvy agent and businessman and I won't buy or sell with any other team.

We were regulars of the previous restaurant that occupied this space but stopped going when the quality and service took a dive.  We were excited to hear that someone had stepped in and took over.  We went for dinner and saw that the name had changed and the interior had been tastefully updated from the 80's colors and confused decor to more modern classy vibe.  The white table cloths were a nice touch along with the classical music playing in the background.  The service was top notch, very attentive, well trained and polite and we found a new and updated menu along with the other much needed changes.  My daughter had the house made lasagna, and referred to it as the "bomb.com".  My wife and oldest daughter both ordered the sea bass which was seasoned and cooked perfectly, a nice surprise as I often find seafood overcooked.  I had the Filet Oscar which rivaled the filet I had at Durant's the night before while out with friends.  Try Mac n cheese which my daughter ordered as a side, but could easily be a stand out on it's own merits.  Great experience, great food and we were told that the owner has more updates and upgrades planned for the space.  We will definitely be regulars again at this location.
