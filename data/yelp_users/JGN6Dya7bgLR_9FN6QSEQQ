My fiance and I got  a Groupon deal for the introductory lesson. The instructor was fantastic. He was enthusiastic but professional and excellent at making sure everyone was having a great time.

I walked up to two sales associates who were talking and asked about a screen cover. One of them showed me to them and in the middle of talking to me, began helping another customer. I still wanted to get it installed but upon asking his reply was "I'm busy now. Take a look at our phone cases." There was not even a redirect to someone who could've helped me. So I left and went to Fry's.
