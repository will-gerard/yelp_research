This is by far the *best* noodle place in town! Their BBQ pork ramen is absolutely delicious, comes in a giant bowl, and the noodles are perfectly cooked. Try the Milky Green Tea-- it's my favorite drink on the menu. The owner is very pleasant, and if you can catch bits and pieces of what she's saying in Japanese- also pretty hilarious :)

I'm from Kaneohe so when my husband found this place, we decided to give it a try. Here's a couple of things I can say about this place. The good things about it: friendly service, nice atmosphere & decor. There are some issues we notice right away however. We came in with a Groupon, and were restricted to certain parts of the menu due to this. As others have previously mentioned, the portions were very small for the price we were paying. The teriyaki chicken was not very teriyaki and was dry as it came with no teriyaki dressing, the rice was dry and seemed to be a larger grain than it ought to be for this type of meal, and the kalua pork was very mushy and wet, and came with a large strip of fatty connective tissue laid over the top. Typically, kalua can be served over rice and cabbage, but ours seemed like it was some sort of sauerkraut. We heard a microwave ding before a meat dish was brought out, which was also a little disconcerting. I paid $21 for two, two-meat dishes, and the portions were very small. I had high hopes for this place, but there are too many things out of whack in my opinion. We had planned on trying the dessert/smoothie menu, but there were many things that had been crossed out. The whole experience was a little disappointing, but I'm glad I tried it to find out for myself.

I tried this place out with a few friends the other night for the first time... It was a great experience! The pot stickers are reminiscent of dim-sum in their shape and style, and they're very pleasant tasting in comparison to most other gyoza/dumpling appetizers, locally.   The garlic chicken was recommended to me-- it didn't disappoint. It had a little kick to it, and the sauce wasn't too soupy. I had this with their fried rice-- also very good. The vibe of the restaurant is pretty classic and amusing, with the little goldfish that greets you right as you walk in the door.   Their water glasses were very festive, so they put in the extra effort. My friends swear by this place, so I'm glad I got to finally try it for myself.

I go here often to pick up their pre-cooked Bao; BBQ pork buns are fabulous! The red-bean filled mini-pancakes are amazing, so it's a "pity" you can only get them on the weekends! They have an awesome selection in the bakery/pastry area and have tons of fresh produce-- including noodles, and even the occasional shipment of Poi.

I love Indian food but this place just sets the bar...I've tried several similar locations in town, but this place is the best in my opinion. Their garlic nan is well seasoned and just the right texture, their lamb curry has great flavor without letting the heat do all the work and their dinner sampler selection is lovely. Each side dish on the platter was great to sample. Their tables are small and cozy and they also feature a buffet though me and the hubby chose to just dine-in with service. This place is a must try. Also, Groupon featured these guys for a great deal which made the experience thrifty as well as tasty ;)

Fresh food, always good. Their themes usually impress. More impressive however, is the super friendly service.

This location is now "Field Kitchen," and me and the hubby were very hesitant about staying. After a manager got us to sample some of their fresh chicken however, we ended up staying out of good faith. It was a great idea and the food was just lovely...Their take is more modern, portions bigger per a la carte' and they now carry meat and a wide array of other alcoholic and non-alcoholic infused beverages. Overall, very good changes I'm seeing on the horizon. P.S., with the $7.99 build your own salad & sides, me and hubby paid around $5 dollars less for everything we usually want ;)

Of the several times I've been here, I can say I like the way they make their pepperoni pizzas with those toppings under the cheese. Interesting & makes sure the pepp doesn't burn. However, we ordered the bacon and cheese pizza and whew, that bacon was way overdone and too crispy; too much on the char. The salads are huge and taste fantastic though; the dinner salad is my favorite.

-----EDIT----- 4 Stars Came here again to give it a second chance, and the visit didn't disappoint. We had a waiter who was very friendly and never had us feeling forgotten about or less important than the other customers. The food was great and orders were correct, so nothing to complain about there. The waiter doubled up as the bartender and he had the friendly persona to go with it. I'm updating my 1 star review to a 4 star since 3 would be stingy with an all around good experience. (& glad I didn't get the waitress we got last time!) -----EDIT-----  1 Star I'm used to great food and service with Red Robin, but this location was very disappointing. The waitress brought us drinks with no ice, and when I asked if we could get some, she mentioned they were running low. The issue with this, is every other drink that came out of the kitchen had a normal and decent amount of ice. This was inconsistent and bothersome.   The waitress approached our table initially, and she would only interact with my husband. This followed through when she had brought more ice back in her pitcher of water, and managed to only give him ice while she managed to give me none during the next refill.   Just bad service. I love the food for the price, but I won't be going back to this particular location. It's unfortunate that we have to drive out to Rio Salado when this location was conveniently located next to a Costco. No thanks.

This place has a nice comfortable vibe, a little personal with darker lighting and an industrial setting. I tried the Turkey club and it met all my expectations! As well as their seasonal Pumpkin Porter. I definitely loved this beer, and it didn't taste terribly overwhelming like some seasonal foods tend to taste.   Great for groups & casual dates I imagine-- went there with my co-workers for lunch and we all fit in two tables. Co-workers tried the Peach pale ale, Bleu Cheese burger (not sure on the name), their signature cheeseburgers with pepper jack, and of course, we added pickles.   The servers were attentive and friendly- I think someone mentioned this place has manly cooks and servers or something odd like that, but they made their point and I guess I'll agree! My friend frequents this place for brunch- pancakes, the whole shabang, and she loves it. I'm pretty thrilled with the comfortable feel, the beer choices & the food. It's not your everyday boring pub food, that's for sure.

This is one of the more competent Walgreens locations. Love that they are open 24-7 as well. The pharmacy is usually pretty spot on in getting my orders correct, and they've always been friendly. Good selection of cosmetics and boots brand products also. No complaints so far! They use nfc at their registers also, which is nice for quick checkouts.

We stopped here because we were starving and I had a wicked headache. The environment was loud and festive, but it was definitely fun. The cheese pizza we got was well seasoned and thin. The service was super friendly, and I recommend this place as a pizza-lover.

The delivery guy got lost on the way to our place but he was friendly. Mostly, the pizza arrived  very late, they got our order wrong (mozzarella cheese sticks instead of cheesy bread that we ordered), and the pizza dough was undercooked at the bottom, tasted  very bad at the top of the crust, and the cheese was incredibly soupy & oily. Thank you but no thank you.

The day we tried this place, I was totally not in the mood for sandwiches. This place definitely changed my mind! Tried the Dilly Bird with a half salad, and it was ah-may-zing. Don't hesitate if you're into good sandwiches. The bread was fresh and artisan, and the sandwich was the "can't talk while eating because it's so fabulous" type. :)

Adorable little market with a good selection of things. Candy, snacks, food type items, and pre-made lunches. The workers there are very polite and helpful. And yes, if you were wondering, they *do* have Redbean pastries in the freezer, "Taiyaki" YESS!!

Ate here today for a small business meeting & had the Southwest Burger combo with the Wedge fries. The fries were seasoned very well and cooked well, and same goes for the burger. The guacamole + jack + honey mustard made the burger practically perfect. I'll admit to being in a total food coma afterwards, which maybe isn't the best for a business meeting, but it was so worth it!   Husband tried the BBQ burger, he loved it as well-- this says a lot. The burger had grilled onions which means they really did it right.

I had hopes for this place even with Abe's passing, but my experience did not prove to be a good one at all. My hubby dropped my shoes off on a Wednesday to have them re-sized. Guy 1 was apparently working that day, and mentioned he would stretch the strap to fit the shoes correctly. We had no idea why this would work since I wanted the shoes smaller vs. bigger, but whatever, that's not even the weirdest part of the matter. He tells me to come back in on the following Saturday to be fitted. I arrive there and Guy 1 is not working. It is guy 2 who seems nice enough, but alas, he can't even find my shoes.   These guys work in the same place and don't communicate with each other whatsoever. I'm slightly irritated at this point; where are my shoes, and what have you done with them? Guy 2 had no idea what was going on... So, guy 2 tells me to come back AGAIN on Tuesday. I arrive, and Guy 1 is indeed working. Upon walking into the store my shoes are on a shelf thing with a bunch of other shoes, so I grab my box and approach the counter to figure out what to do about re-sizing them. Guy 1 is incredulous when he realizes "my shoes were just over there," because other guy apparently shouldn't have put them there. I ask him why he and other guy don't talk to keep track of things, like make notes, etc., since they work with the same customers in the same place. He gets irritated and says something about how it doesn't matter. Then, he keeps insisting that I was the one he spoke with originally, because that somehow has meaning for him. I keep telling him, no, that he spoke with my hubby. After awhile he accepts that and says with attitude, "Oh, so you guys don't talk to each other?" What an idiot attempt at an analogy. Anyway, I reiterate to Guy 1 what someone told us the first time we tried Abe's Shoe Repair about my pair of shoes, that we need to "stretch the strap in order to shrink the shoe size." Guy 1 is incredulous again and invalidates his initial statements of how to fix the shoe, after I reiterate what guy 2 told us they would do.   Eventually, I try the shoes on for him and he says he can't fix the shoe since it is way too big and adding extra holes would fray the shoe. He said I needed to go buy another pair of shoes. Really, Guy 1? Is this is your little pearl of wisdom after you guys lost my shoes for over a week and don't attempt to communicate with one another about fixing my shoes? Sad to say, this business most probably had wonderful potential prior to Abe's passing, but it is not the same anymore. They will lose your shoes then leave them next to the door for easy theft, and won't be able to accomplish simple tasks like applying cotton canvas adhesive and adding additional strap punctures to your shoe. Guy 2 will be clueless (although quite nice), Guy 1 will be very rude and his word on good business will be uncouth. Sorry Abe's Shoe Repair, but I will NOT be coming back for your bad business.

I love this place for a few reasons. First to note, is they serve you hot Jasmine tea right when you sit down. Tea to talk over is fabulous when you're waiting for your meal to be prepared. The pot stickers are my favorite- the meat is well seasoned and the dumpling flour is perfectly chewy. Their won-ton soup is possibly the best in town! I recently tried their Lobster Sauce Shrimp (comes with white rice), and it was amazing. The shrimp were GIANT sized, and tasted perfectly fresh which is odd for being in the desert!

EDIT: I quite like their Crab won-tons and their baked crab with cheese. Their egg drop soup is 1000 times better than Panda's (way back in the day). Also, tried the egg rolls and they're pretty good. But seriously, the strawberry ice cream is the best strawberry ice cream. Ever. (that being said, you'd better leave me some)    Pretty good food and selection, kind staff, and nice atmosphere. Used to be busy in here on behalf of the Sunday crowd. Here are some of our favorites:   Green beans- awesome garlic seasoning  Potstickers- nice! The sauce does compliment Shrimp seafood delight mix  Teriyaki chicken   Overall, usually a good experience here. Have never gotten sick from anything, and they also sell cute trinkets at the register. They sometimes have green tea ice cream here as well- one of my faves.

Try the pan-fried noodles with beef or chicken-- it's my favorite of all their dishes. The husband can certainly vouch for the Sweet & Pungent chicken, and the customer service is very friendly and personal. I love that they are so busy nowadays during the lunch time-- it's well worth the wait in my opinion.

First came to this place awhile back prior to their entrées being similar to combos. I liked their Jerk chicken and fried rice and their red jade chicken. I went back here recently and still enjoyed their jade chicken with steamed rice- it's a bit of a rich dish as far as flavor and sauce goes, but it's quite good.   I tried a little bit of my hubby's machaca quesadilla, and it was also quite good. I'd definitely come back to this place. The prices aren't too bad and there's a decent amount of things to choose from.

I consider this place to be the best bakery in town-- here's why.  Their caramel macaroons are ah-may-zing! I've had macaroons from various places from Hawaii to Anaheim, Ca, and these are by far my absolute favorite. The caramel filling is sweet, creamy, and fantastic when slightly chilled. The macaroon cookie itself has a perfect consistency that sits somewhere between chewy and crispy.   Macaroons from Essence are literally my favorite baked good next to my friend's home made pumpkin cookies with cream cheese frosting. JUST GO TRY ONE. I can't vouch for their food just yet, but if I happen to try it out, I'll post an update here. Cheers!

We always get the chicken tacos-- usually with all chips and their chipotle style salsa. We eat here when we're feeling for something fresh and not too heavy. They have the coolest little in-store events too; I picked up a free re-usable bag that touts a positive environment (ocean-related) message.

Great food, & friendly service. I've tried several of their dishes, but prefer the lo-mein category; the children's lo-mein is actually quite good. Not sure why pei wei gets negative ratings, but I enjoy this place as much as I do Tott's Asian Diner. Both are great places to eat at. It'd be nice if pei wei had listed open/closed hours though.

Their thai boba slush and taro boba slushies are what me and the hubby get just about every visit. The boba is always fresh and the slushies are made very well. The service is friendly and fast! They have appetizers on the menu, but we digress-- we haven't tried them yet. The crispy calamari certainly looks good though!

Me and the husband usually go for their "reverse happy hour." I'm pretty happy with the pricing and with the overall quality of the food. Yeah they do make you wear a 21+ wristband, but I don't blame them trying to keep their liquor license.   I'm definitely a fan of the spicy tuna rolls and the crispy california. They're both amazing and decently priced; around $3-4.50 per roll during reverse happy hour. $4 kirin's, $5 mixed drinks... Their reverse happy hour is 9-close.

This location is friendly, clean, and their food is what you'd expect from a Red Robin diner. It's a little far for us to drive out there, but I appreciate the price margin and the quality of the food. Whenever I feel like an "american diner" this is the place I usually prefer.   It's such an upgrade from a Johnny Rocket's establishment feel, where they leave plastic bag pieces in your milkshake. I'll definitely keep coming back to this location.

The happy hour @ the bar is a lovely experience! The little menu has great pricing (anywhere from $2-$4 I believe) and the bartenders are always witty enough to mix up a drink of your own concoction. The bruschetta & brio burgers are always pretty satisfying.

Ordered from Eat 24 Tempe, and it was a great experience. Guy took 20 minutes to delivery our food, not bad at all! Ordered the panang curry, yellow curry (thai hot) and the egg rolls. Everything was certainly up to par and was worth the little research. If you like Thai, I'm most sure you'll have a great experience at this place.

This is easily my favorite dessert and yogurt place. Their selection has grown over the years and they make everything in-house. They prepare their toppings in-house also. The flavors are non-fat, some non-dairy, and some even gluten-free. Salted caramel and pistachio so far have been a few of my favorites...  Me and the hubby go most Tuesdays and Thursdays for their double points or BOGO deals. This place is close to home as well, so we happen to be lucky in biking distance. I prefer this place over the bigger chains like Yogurtland and etc. so definitely give it a try.

The service here is usually very friendly. The wait staff isn't incredibly attentive, but the wings are usually prepared well, and it's certainly worth going for a good discount on Wing Tuesdays: wings then are 60 cents per. I prefer boneless, hubby gets the traditional: I'm glad they changed the discount to either option.

This place has a laid back college vibe which might appeal to some. I ordered the chicken taco plate with black beans and the fried rice. Unfortunately I did not care much for the meal. The black beans were alright, the rice a little less than that, and the chicken tacos were super dry. The hot sauce was too heavy on the vinegar to lessen the dryness without offense either.   If you're into cheap college food with space to sit around, then you may dig this place, but I thought it was pretty bad. I did give it a chance though, despite the bad reviews.

First of all, the egg rolls.   They are amazing!  Big, crispy, and the filling is well-seasoned & meat based. We ate there-- cute spot with a few in-house tables. The sesame chicken was great & the fried rice was very reminiscent of teppanyaki, a little buttery and not too salty. I recommend this place if you want a noticeable step up from Panda Express.   Also-- their portions are pretty big. They gave our food to us in take-out plastic containers, similar to the ones Pei Wei uses. The containers seem small, but my husband was impressed because he actually had to take some home!   The service is super friendly and they seem very family operated. They deliver, which is also fantastic.

2/5 for great people working there, and the friendly vibe you get just walking in the door. BAM, smells like a pickling factory but do not fear, the bar area looks fun. Our experience was bad however-- the noodles in our ramen were cooked Al Dente, and you know what that means once an amalgam of them begins to expand in your stomach. They definitely weren't cooked all the way, so thus, I felt like I was going to LITERALLY lose my food after I finished a relatively small bowl. Yeah, I'm a small person, but you know, I can still eat! I just felt so sick afterwards.  The spinach- strange & refreshing. The carrots- lovely. The pork- cold, but good. The nori- you know, your standard nori. The broth- yeah, a little salty, but good. We tried the Pai Ton, the tonkotsu broth without the Pork ordeal.   But the noodles! They made me so sick, and I really want to love this place because their ramen is so diverse. After the meal, one of the friendly staff members made us some little non-alcoholic shots, so like I said-- SUPER NICE people! I just can't handle their style of food, it doesn't agree with me at all. If you're sensitive like me, try Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe-- they'll be a more classic and authentic option for you.  Cheers!

The yellow curry was fragrant and amazingly flavorful-- the best one I've tried so far! The salad and spicy peanut dressing are definitely worth having, and I appreciate their awesome selection of desserts on the menu. Overall, an inviting place to eat with very memorable food!  We are lucky to have them in this area :)
