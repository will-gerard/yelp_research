More like crappy don's.....     Cheap beer, bad food, and a rude bouncer ...  We went and got a bucket of beer that was $10 which was a good deal.

We just left and we loved it! We were there celebrating our anniversary. It was romantic and the staff was helpful and friendly! The food was amazing and the wine even better! I couldn't pronounce a thing on the menu and everyone was still so accommodating. I have not one bad thing to say about our lovely evening.

The staff was friendly and a little blunt but I loved it! The gelato is delicious and the coffee is good too!

Don't live here !!!!!!! It is UNSAFE and the office is useless. After I moved out they claim that I owe them a lot of money and that I never put a security deposit down or a pet deposit. They are robbers and plain rude ! One star is generous !

Good little surprise ! The Hawaiian and Baja rolls are super tasty! I enjoyed it very much.   The fish is fresh and there are plenty of choices. Some rolls are a little pricey but definitely worth it.

They fixed the screen on my iphone 5. I had a yelp deal that got me 20 off. It was the best deal I found and they did an amazing job! It was like brand new and they have great priced covers.

Great sandwiches and great people! The staff is really nice and helpful. The sandwiches are around 10 bucks which is a little pricey but worth it ! It's super tasty and a good chill atmosphere .

Just tried this place. It's simple and quick. You make your own pizza or salad or you can pick off their menu. It was super delicious and I will definitely be coming back!

Just had dinner on the back patio. It was simply terrific. It's a great chill vibe and great service. We tried a lot of the items. We had clam chowder, crab cakes, tacos, fish and chips, and ceviche.  I didn't try one thing I didn't like. It was understated deliciousness and I will be coming back!
