If I could give zero stars, I would.  This guy is a joke.  I have been waiting to have my expensive leather sectional repaired for a very small stain since MAY 21st.  My couch is under warranty, and both the company and I have had no luck in getting Fred to call us back.  The repair is covered, and the guy should get paid.  So why am I getting the run-around?  I initially called to inquire about their services, and was told I would receive a call the next day to set up an appointment for Fred to come out to my home.  One week, then two weeks go by - so I called and was told "oh, I thought you were already set up?"  So by this time, he was booked out for 2 weeks.  So I waited a total of 4 weeks before he came out to look at the piece.  Fred was over an hour late for our "appointment" and seemed rushed and irritated when he was here.  He wanted to take the piece of my sectional back to his shop to fix it, although previously he told me he could fix it on site.  He kept going back and forth on what he wanted to do.  In addition, he couldn't give me an estimate but told me that it would probably be more than what my warranty would allow.  When I balked at this, he finally decided to not take my furniture (I wouldn't have allowed him anyway considering I probably wouldn't get it back for another 4 weeks).  He told me that I would receive a call the next day with the estimate.  Not surprisingly, AGAIN the call never came.  This was JUNE 25th.  I called my furniture company's warranty line and explained the situation.  They called Leather Like New directly and also never received a call back, and I have since been looking for other services as now it is JULY 29th and my piece is still stained.  I am so frustrated.  Fred's excuse over and over was that he is "busy."  I am a professional and we are all busy!  Customer service here is horrible; I felt pushed off, and honestly lied to about when I would get calls back.  I have called and left messages about my dissatisfaction.  I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY CALLS OR EXPRESSIONS OF REMORSE IN REGARDS TO HOW I HAVE BEEN TREATED.  Fred will not be busy for long.  I will never be recommending his services, or lack thereof for that matter.  If you want to be treated appropriately and with respect, and to have something done in a timely manner, please look elsewhere.

I recently moved to the area from Las Vegas, where I had my car impeccably hand-washed and detailed at least once a month for an awesome price and great customer service with no haggling.  Since Full Circle was convenient and seemed to have similar services (sans hand-washing), I checked it out.  I have given them THREE tries.  Third strike and they're out.  During my most recent visit, I expressed that I was not satisfied with the previous vacuuming job as the hatch wasn't even touched and there was debris left all over my floormats (heavy duty rubber and easy to clean).  I asked that they please pay special attention to these areas, and went inside to pay.  Not 5 minutes later I saw my car in line to be washed.  I walked out and asked the guy at the wash station "how could my car be completely vacuumed in 5 minutes?" and he promised he would pay special attention to it after the wash and address my concerns.  He also stated that the first vacuuming guy stated something about "dog hair" being present.  I had previously removed the hammock cover from the back and there were rogue hairs on the edges of the seats which needed vacuumed (keep in mind I have my car detailed MONTHLY and take precaution to have my dogs clean and on the cover, so this was NOT major).  YES my car has debris and dog hair which needs vacuumed.  Why would I bring it here to be done if it was CLEAN already?  So I tell the cashier I will wait longer to have it done correctly, I don't mind.  WELL when my car is done after the supposed "TWO" vacuums, I am told it's ready.  I check it before leaving and it was not clean as there was still sand and dirt in the hatch and crumbs on the front seats and in the cup holders.  Ugh.  So frustrating.  I didn't say anything because by this point I was tired of talking because as history suggested, it did not good.  I did tip the drying guy.  Hey, it's not his fault.  Another thing, it is no secret that while you are waiting you can't really see what they are doing with your car as they have you in this circular waiting room well away from the vacuuming and drying areas.  Unless you like waiting in the scorching heat, you don't have to watch and can just assume they are doing a half-@$$ job.  I will NEVER be going back there.  I take pride in my car and when I pay for something and you expect me to tip on top of that, I want it done COMPLETELY and CORRECTLY.  Please avoid this place.

Love love love Yupha's!  The food is always fresh and exactly how I order it, plus the service is always friendly and the restaurant is immaculately clean.  I don't live close and anytime I want Thai I make the drive to Yupha's.  If you are a fan of Pad Thai, theirs is delicious.  Hot is definitely hot enough unless you want to burn off your food sweating while you eat, then order the Thai Hot!

I went in for a nosestud piercing and JD was my piercer. He was laidback, conversational, super clean, explained everything in detail, and put my mind at ease. He helped me pick out the stud and location that was right for me and the piercing was only minimally uncomfortable. This was my first piercing other than my ears and I was pleased with the whole experience. Thanks JD!

I have lived all over the country and religiously have my teeth cleaned every 6 months.  I have no qualms about the dentist and feel that a little discomfort here and there is to be expected.  That being said, I can also say that Dr. Tran and her staff at Simply Dentistry are simply the BEST!  I went in for my initial cleaning and oral evaluation and received the most comprehensive, gentle, and thorough treatment I have ever had.  Chelsea is wonderful and I will go back to her time and time again.  Dr. Tran listened to all of my concerns, in particular one area in my mouth that has been repaired THREE times by three different dentists (one was an oral surgeon!) with no resolution.  At a subsequent visit, Dr. Tran successfully placed a new filling and repaired a gap that had been plaguing me for years.  Plus, I felt nothing when Lissa was placing the local anesthetic.  Win win!  I am also in the health care field which has essentially become a service industry, and I appreciate the warm welcome from Brittany and the jovial and upbeat yet professional nature of the staff.  There is a definite reason that EVERYONE on Yelp gives this team 5 stars!!!

Spa and Nail Creations is wonderful and truly worth the price.  I have been seeing Michelle regularly for over 3 years for gel manicures and pedicures.  She does an immaculate, clean, gentle, and beautiful job.  She has opened up my world to a variety of colors, nail designs, and glitter!  So much fun.  I am in an industry where people are always looking at my hands, and I really appreciate that my gel manicure can last almost three weeks with the toll my hands take on a day-to-day basis.  I never thought that I could have nice nails until the gel polishes were created.  I still drive from North Phoenix to see Michelle at Spa and Nail Creations.  Check them out - you won't be disappointed!  They don't have a heavy turnover either - it's always the same friendly faces, and you'll truly be made to feel at home.

I love this place for casual drinks or date night.  The drinks are perfectly done - strong but tasty (get the Manhattan OMG), and the food is worth the price.  Not huge portion sizes but you don't need to be overly stuffed because by the last bite you'll be satisfied thanks to the flavor.  I also enjoy the ambience - very classy but not stuffy.  I definitely will be going back CPH.

The truffled mushroom pizza (with added prosciutto) is hands-down the yummiest pizza I've had in a long time!!! Also the happy hour is great and there is a decent wine selection. As for the service, every time it has been on point and I enjoy the ambience. It's on High Street too which is an added bonus. Enjoy!

Since working with Brock, he has been nothing but helpful, patient, informative, and attentive. I can tell that he truly enjoys educating me and tailoring my specific insurance needs. I feel confident in the choices that I have made for my car, home, life, and disability insurances. He also is adept with retirement planning and liability insurance. I highly recommend Brock and his personalized and complete services. You will be more than satisfied with the detailed care he provides to you. Thank you Brock!
