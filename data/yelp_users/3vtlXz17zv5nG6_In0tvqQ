Date of visit 6/17/16 - damaged my vehicle and refused to take responsibility.  Paid $70 for the worst car wash and interior clean I have ever seen.  I told them I had 40 minutes and he recommended the "super clean" which was supposed to include clean and condition on the seats, door jams, mats .  An hour later I got my car back.  The door hinge was damaged so that the driver door clicked every time it opened and closed.  There was visible dirt in the jams.  They cleaned the front of the driver and passenger seats but didn't touch the back of the seats.  There was even still visible dirt and on the mats. When I complained about the time  it took, damage to the car, and poor quality of work the manager made excuses and told me that the super clean does not include door jams, the back of seats and that they didn't damage the door hinge (the vehicle is less than a year old, there is no way the damage was due to age).  No apology, no refund, no offer to fix the damage to the car.

Great small gym for people working downtown.  Never too crowded in the mornings or at lunch and I have never seen out of service equipment.  Locker rooms are always clean and well stocked.  Towels are a bit rough, but I would rather they save money on towels than raise rates.    The staff is great.  They are happy to chat, but never pushy.  The trainers that lurk will often offer advice or help without trying to sell sessions.  I am reticent to give a review, because the gym is small, but never crowded.  If word gets out, I worry that this little gem will get over-subscribed.  The gym is not big enough to comfortably handle more than 30-40 people at a time.  Although I have never seen more than 10 there at once.
