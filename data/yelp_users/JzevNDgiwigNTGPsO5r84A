My boyfriend and I recently ate at Tee Pee as he knew I had been there before and I now live close!  It's known to be authentic and the food was definitelty tasty and served REALLY hot.  I really need to bring my Dad here, he wants it burns-your-mouth hot.  The server was super nice.  I would say the seating seems a little outdated, but no biggie.  On a Tuesday night I was surprised by the number of people sitting outside having a few beers, seems like a good spot to hang out if that's what you're looking for!

We ordered the chicken with black bean sauce and beef with broccoli. They were both fantastic, but the won ton soup was delightful.  Food was tasty and not too salty. Delivery time was a little longer than promised and customer service left something to be desired, but overall a good choice for local chinese delivery.

July 2011 - def. typical bar food - no option for side salad w my wrap...umm potato salad I guess? Limited menu and not much "healthy" but it's not like I really thought there would be!

I found out about JATC from a friend and love Teresa and Mara! My pup luna goes every day and it makes me so happy she gets to run and play all day....not sitting at home alone while I'm working! They also treated Luna like a member of their family when she got sick. I recommend them to anyone looking for a day care!

I have been utilizing MTO Cleaning for a few years now and am ALWAYS satisfied with the service!  Judy, the owner, is fantastic and is always willing to work me in if I need a cleaning last minute.  I also really like that she prices homes by sq ft - they don't have to come out to do an estimate like many other services do.  They will come as often as you like and you will be VERY happy you spent the money - and I think it's EXTREMELY affordable!!

This place is kind of hilarious in that there's at least 20 ladies and one dude is calling all of the shots. he has quite the harem!! i do think they're a little pricey however every time i have been i've been super satisfied and my last 2 gel manicures have lasted 3 weeks before finally starting to chip.  i also chose to have my brows waxed here instead of going next door to the european waz place - the girl did a GREAT job, they look the best they have in a long time.  both nail and wax lady were SUPER meticulous.  If you're ok with paying a little more, this is a great place to go!

I LOVE THIS PLACE.  I started doing Bikram Yoga in 2009 and had tried Sumit's a couple of times before - now that I live in the area I did the 30-day challenge in Dec and got super hooked...the instructors are phenomenal (Kim, Julie, Jordan, and Gina are my favs) and they offer variety; you can take the 80 min. "Sumit's Yoga" and they also offer hour-long flow classes for the more traditional yogi or yogini...i got to practice a few things I had never tried before and in the hot room your body is all limbered up!  Come join me, I am committed for the next 3 months at least! ;)

This is evidently a new location, very close to my new apartment which is sweet.  The ladies were all super nice, I had a lot of fun talking with them; my bf doesn't like eggs, at all, and she was kind enough to make his bfast bagel w/o egg and extra other stuff.  I had the "skinny" sandwich which is eggwhites, turkey sausage and sundried tomato spread on a thin bagel, would have been awesome if the spread wasn't kind of ketchup-y.  My only "complaint" - otherwise highly recommended!  Oh, parking is kind of a pain, not many spots out front, but they offer free valet for an hour!
