Every time I go here, I order the same thing. A junior cheeseburger with a cesar side salad. Every time I get the wrong items. I'm getting real tired of it. I've worked the drive thru at fast food places. It's seriously not that hard. Come on people....

Fiancé and I randomly went here for dinner. I got the mango kingh curry and pineapple (I think that's what it was called) with tofu. I had them make it mild and oh mylanta it was UH-MAZING!!!!!! We also got the crab puffs (we are crab puff snobs) and these were some of the best crab puffs both of us have ever had. The cream cheese filling was fresh and definitely higher quality. I can't remember what the Fiancé got, but he was very happy with it. The service was of course amazing and the restaurant was super clean! Looks like we have a new favorite dining spot to add to the list!

If I could leave no stars... I would have. There are gnats flying around the fruit and tomatoes. It smelled like cat litter when we walked in. Not only are the staff rude, but the miserable customers were just as rude. The only nice woman I ran into asked me if they sell wine there. I told her I have no idea and it was our first time there. Even she said it's the worst Fry's she's ever been to. We're never going back and I suggest you stay away as well. We ended up leaving everything and going to the Fry's 4 minutes down the road on 24th Street. We had a MUCH better experience there.

I called 20 Lounge 5 days in advance to set up appointments for my friend and I. I specifically told the receptionist that we both wanted full sets of gels and pedicures (I was never asked or explained that there are many different kinds of pedicures here). We were really excited because this place has some really great reviews and we heard they serve wine and mimosas and what not. So fast forward to today (Sunday). We show up 45 minutes early. No other customers are there. The receptionist working said the girl who took our appointment scheduled us for gel over lay and the basic pedicures. My friend had to skip the mani because her nails were too short and they didn't have time to do a full set. As I had scheduled. So she got a pedicure. We were asked if we wanted anything to drink. After we found out they no longer have a liquor license, we opted for water and lemonade. Which we never recieved. The woman who was doing my gels constantly complained. She only had an hour and a half of sleep because her bf was in the hospital all night sick and she works 2 jobs. Another woman just stood there not doing anything reading a magazine. So she does my gels, forgets to do the glitter ombre look I asked for since the nail artist wasn't in to do anything special, and off to get the pedicure. She starts saying how bad of a job I did at cutting my own toe nails and to just let her do them next time. Then she doesn't even file them evenly. My nails weren't filed evenly either. One hand is squared off how I normally do them, and the other has random shapes. I don't know if the gels will actually last the 2 weeks she says they will because she kept forgetting if she put coats on or not. For $77 it was totally NOT worth it. I will never come back here again. I'm glad my friend and I came here before making an appt for my bridal party! Guess our search for a decent salon continues.... I'm giving them 2 stars because I simply liked my color choices.

Although my fiance and I had a good experience at the store itself (only after 1 salesman just walked away mid way through asking him a question). Their customer service and their "5 year warranty" protection service is crap. We spent almost $7,000 to furnish most of the rooms in our new home. The foot board and the dresser chipped off in chunks by simply running your nail over a tiny little bump. The kitchen table we ordered came broken and we had to wait 48 hours to hear from customer service before we could get a new one delivered. We ended up having to call them. FOUR TIMES. They can't get anyone to come out and repair the missing chunks on the bedroom set until a month later. Their furniture is cheap. Even their "high end" line is cheap. I will NEVER recommend Ashley Furniture to anyone. Save your money and your sanity!

My fiance and I just purchased a home and needed the landscape cleaned up. We also requested the irrigation system to be looked at, and the lights that are wired in the yard. Eli was quick to get his crew out to give us an estimate (which was a very reasonable price for 11,000 sq ft property) and they got to work right away. Mike was very nice and explained everything to us. He reset the sprinkler system for us (twice) and checked to see if the lighting was receiving any electricity before giving us an estimate on that. They really did an excellent job at a very fair price. We will definitely be recommending them to our friends and neighbors!

Ari was my consultant today when me and 2 of my bridesmaids walked into Brilliant Bridal WITHOUT an appointment (shame on me... I know...). This is the 4th time I was trying on dresses and (to be honest, I bought a dress somewhere else about a month ago that I'm just not crazy about) Ari really went out of her way to help me tie corsets and bring more dresses in my size that we didn't see AND were still in my price range! When I finally had maybe 15 dresses narrowed down to 2, she encouraged me to try the 2 on again. To take my time and make sure that it was what I truly loved. She held one up over the other since they were the same style and when she dropped it, I knew exactly which dress to choose! Now I'm not a sappy person and I never thought that I'd cry over the dress thing, but it was hard to hold back the tears when you find THE ONE. My experience here was AMAZING and my consultant really made this experience extraordinary for not only me, but the 2 girls I brought with! HUGE THANK YOU TO ARI!!!!

My fiance and I had a checklist of things we needed to get done before adding to our family. At that time we had a female cat and a female chihuahua. I had done my fair share of "stalking" local rescues for almost a year until he said ok it's time. WWW was the only rescue I kept going back to. We saw that they were having an adoption event in October at a Petsmart and decided to go. As soon as we walked up, Dani greeted us and we told her about our current fur babies and that we were looking for a male to add to the family. She introduced us to Freddie. He's a giant goober of a pittie and we knew right away he'd fit right in with us! Dani called his foster mom so she could come talk to us about any questions we had and she could say goodbye to him. We were given his paperwork with current vaccines and microchip information and away we went! I still keep in touch with Dani and his foster mom! I have had nothing but a pleasant experience with this rescue group and my fiance and I are SO grateful for all of the hard work that they do! Not many people can do such a selfless thing like saving animals day in and day out. We love our big goofy Freddie and couldn't thank the staff and Freddie's foster mom enough!

My husband and I had our wedding here on February 27th, 2016. After almost 2 years of planning with Jenny at WTR, we couldn't have asked for a better team to work with! Every last detail was absolutely perfect. Our guests raved about how beautiful the venue was. More than half of our guests asked us how in the world did we find this place in the middle of the desert?!?!? Jenny and the WTR staff really made our wedding dreams a reality. I wish we could do it all over again LOL. Thank you to Jenny and the WTR staff for making our vision come to life!

I'm going to be honest. I've avoided this place since they opened in July because I was afraid of sticker shock. My fiance gets his haircut next door every month and I'm usually with him. Last weekend was the Pinup Pop Up event and I was getting antsy waiting around so I reluctantly went in to Kitten Retro Glamour expecting to be let down when I looked at the price tags. I TOTALLY wasn't! For vintage inspired QUALITY clothing, this place has some of the best prices I've seen! I found a brown faux fur stole that the owner generously placed on hold for me for a week so I could come back to try it on with my wedding dress and it was perfect! I plan on coming back after the holidays to try on a few other items! Kitten Retro Glamour won't let you down!

A friend and I came here in between lunch and dinner last weekend. We usually go to the Pita Jungle on Roosevelt, but this one was closer. The decor is amazing. Absolutely beautiful. The food was typical PJ food, but the service was the worst I've ever had. We kept trying to leave reviews while there, but neither of us were getting any cell service. I had to ask for my appetizer after our dinner arrived. Then I had to ask for extra balsamic vinaigrette 3 times before actually getting it. My friend kept clinking her ice around in her empty glass after asking for a refill 3 times. I ended up taking half of my food home, and I had to order a tofu del sol for my husband. The portion size of their takeout is much smaller than if you had sat there and eaten it. We'll continue to go to the PJ on Roosevelt, but we'll never come back here again. We counted 6 people on the wait staff, 2 people hanging out at the hostess podium, and the restaurant was more than half empty. There was no reason service should have been this bad. At least the food was still good.
