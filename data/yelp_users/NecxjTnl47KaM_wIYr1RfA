At first, I was not impressed with this place, not because the food disappointed me but because I thought the service lacked warmth. The owner of the place was just not friendly at all. But I looked past that because their pizza was amazing. After, he saw that my boyfriend and I became regulars and is now always super nice! He appreciates tips... I suppose anything to keep the family business running. He practically lives there. We always order their pineapple and ham pizza. I love the sauce, not too salty and a tint of sweetness. I love that their pizza isn't loaded in grease either. The price may appear higher than other joints but their pizzas are bigger. Love this place.

Andrew Hill, the REAL MVP. He was quick to respond, available at pretty much any time, punctual, courteous, cool, ambitious. Great vibes, great guy. Thank you so much for helping us find our new home in Scottsdale! We love it. I said I wanted to find my new home by the end of Q1-2015 and I did!

This is a hidden joint among a very busy pavilion I like to refer to as the waterhole of Avondale. I never even noticed it until I found it here! Sometimes I crave sushi on the go and now I have found the place when I'm too lazy to go out and dine in. I wish it was cheaper but it's alright. I'll go back.

I was absolutely impressed with this place. I was impressed with the service, their selection of nail polish, their cleanliness, just everything. This place will not rush to get the work done if others are waiting, which is fantastic because quality work is done thru the attentiveness to detail which does indeed take time. I got a gel manicure and a spa pedi, both jobs were done meticulously and the work was perfect. I was happy. I would recommend coming in early because they do get busy! And they do not rush. But trust me, that is something to appreciate when you are the one being worked on!!

Super delish! Their specialty rolls are spectacular! A tad hard on the wallet but quite worth it.

I love this place! Gyro and chicken shwarma pita are absolutely mouth watering. And lately, I've been trying to cut out some meat and dairy from my diet so I had their falafel pita for the first time which was just as satisfying! After reading the enthusiasm and love for the pita chips and hummus on here, I decided to try them, and yes... It's true... Those are out of this world!! Yum! I wish the food was less greasy and that the pita chips were not soaked in oil but... If you've been good and you deserve to indulge, this is a great joint!

Very clean place but the service is bad. I gave them 3 chances and they failed me. They will rush if it is busy. And even if not, their gel polish lasts less than a week! They only do 2 rounds of the light. I am not coming back.

Ordered 2 crepes (Nutella and whole wheat) and 2 iced americanos. Crepes were about 5 bucks and were delicious! Coffee was mediocre, nothing to swoon over. But I loved the ambience of this place. Oh! And also they have punch cards! You get a punch every visit and on your 8th or 9th visit you can get a free crepe or beverage. Definitely coming back!
