I like this place.I don't get to peruse often enough,but it's always a refreshing adventure when I do have the opportunity. They've got a decent amount of Crowley and the likes that many others won't even carry because it's not the pretty sparkly faerie dusty stuff. The folks who run the place are always warm,genuine and inviting. I even had a spooky kinda thing happen here. It was 2 years ago in December.I stopped in between job interviews to find some candles for a friend. They didn't have what I was looking for,but on my way out,a lady sitting at a reading table said,"before you go,come pick out a stone"from a bowl of shiny lil rocks. I picked one I liked and she told me it would bring me something I needed. I laughed to myself and said,"well,that would be a job"...(I'd been looking for a franticly stressed 2 months)and about 2 hours after I left the store,I got not one but 2 different offers. I did call the store the next day to let her know what happened. I don't neccessarilly believe in that sort of thing,but thought the experience was creepy cool none the less.

I like this place.I'm comfortable here. I don't drink and don't watch sports so unfortunately there's not much of a reason for me to go,but the few times I've been with friends have been very enjoyable. I did play trivia one night and cheated off some other player's smartphone. I like the fact that real people go and are just plain social. Haven't tried the food yet. Oh,I stopped in last night for a bit with a friend and we had the blonde server who was genuinely nice to us.I wish I had better recall,but I think she said her name was Valerie when she came to the table as we arrived. On the few occasions I've been here,have always been treated well even though all I'm drinking is Pepsi... Some bars look down on that as they consider it "deadheading" and taking up space...They make their money on alcohol,so they make nothing on me... Treated very well here every time none the less.

In assisting a friend who's relocating from the east coast,we went apartment shopping.Upon arrival,the woman at the desk took his info and told him about the apartments.We asked to see one and she said none were available to see.She said the one that was coming up for rent wasn't "ready"so she wasn't allowed to show it.I asked if they had a model apartment,she said "No."He explained he was only in town for 24 hours and asked if there was another time within that time frame he could see it and she said "No." He liked the location so I told him I'd go back on my own after he left and see if I could see one. I go a few days later. A different woman behind the desk. Leticia.(I so wish I got the first woman's name!)I explain the situation to Leticia and she apologizes to me that my friend wasn't shown an apartment and takes me on a tour of the property and shows me....wait for it...A MODEL APARTMENT...You know,the very specific thing I asked of the other woman who told me they didn't have one. I asked Leticia if this was a new feature within the last few days ans again she apologized stating the model is ALWAYS ready to be shown to interested parties and any "work"they need to do to it,is done off visiting hours... Needless to say,at that point it became obvious that at least the other woman had either no desire to get off her fat ass and do her job,or she didn't want to rent to caucasians... Either way,no excuse,and I'd never rent or refer anyone to this place. If that's what you get when not even a tennant,I can't imagine how services would be for a renter. Shame on you Camelback Cove for hiring either racists or lazy fucks.

Best Buy,you really suck. Tried to buy a camera the other day. Mid day,mid week,store pretty empty. 3 employees hanging around the camera department as I started to look at options. No one asked if they could help,in fact they first stopped their conversation in an attempt to become invisible. No problem,I'll poke around till I either find what I want ,or until I have comparison questions to narrow down choices. I think I have it,I'm ready to select. Where'd everyone go? I'm so lonely. I start to wander a bit and see if they're doing laundry in the appliance section. nope. Maybe around by the video cameras. Nope nope. Under a display cabinet? Nah,that would be silly... They were just gone. Poofed. Vanished. Vaporized. I decided it had to be the nefarious work of aliens. Yes,I said "nefarious". I became frightened in my alone-ness Fearing next would be an invasion of the Apple People of the Crack Basha's. Who would protect me? The aliens abducted all the staff of Best Buy,so it would just be me. I couldn't possibly stop them all. They would come,snarling their toofless grimaces at me. I would be defenseless. Fearing my life and existance as I know it,I saw only 3 choices. 1)Face them all.Aliens and Apple People of the Crack Basha's.Fight till the end or vaporization. 2)Take what I wanted as there was no one left to stop me. 3)Make a hasty retreat and go elsewhere to purchase a camera. Gentle readers,as you read this harrowing tale,you can safely assume I chose plan #3. New camera in my possession,safe at home taking pictures of the pets grateful to have gotten out alive. Since all the help at Best Buy has been vaporized,you may want to go elsewhere if you'd like to purchase anything that isn't self serve. Remember to get a subscription to some crap magazine on your way out. Thank you,come again.

Looked at a 2 bedroom apartment here a few weeks back. I call this corporate housing. Why?Because while the staff was nice enough,they all that that corporate mindset and bottom line attitude. It was like dealing with robots. There was no wavering at all and no accomodating or any deviations to their structure. I liked the apartment and the overall property and location,but everything had a fee associated. An application fee that was something insane like $175.00. For what?I have to pay for you to do your job filling out forms???Are you kidding? Oh,well,there's a special.if you rent today,that fee will be waived....Gee.what a pal Chet.Really...If I wanted to move into a different apartment once a tennant,there was a "move"fee associated with that as well.No,not to physically move my shit.Just for letting me upgrade...I've known 2 people who lived there for a few years and finally moved because every year wiuthout fail they raised their rents to whatever max they could. Meanwhile new tennants were paying much less to get them in the property. Keep making that cheddah Arioso.Ka-ching! Hopefully one day your greedy asses will go under. This is the very mindset that causes decent working folks to go under through no fault of their own. Shame on you Arioso!

Call it timing,luck,kismet,or even serendipity. Have been looking for something.Not sure what,not sure how,but I know I needed a change. Wandered in here and made an appointment with Ethan. I know of him. I know of the salon. Hadn't gotten a hair cut in about 10 years... A trim here and there but nothing in the way of styling. I envisioned something very specific,evocative even of a span of time. I didn't have to say much but he immediately understood what I wanted and where I was coming from. I left the salon about an hour ago and I'm still on a cloud. He was able to give me back a part of myself I was feeling slip away. I don't know how better to explain it. What I walked out with was PERFECT as was the entire experience. He took his time,took great care with every detail as well as the execution. Right down to the perfect music selection. Ethan,THANK YOU!

It was time for me to update my business wardrobe. When it's that time,there are 3 Houses I look to. Hugo Boss St.John Ralph Lauren Had never been in the Lauren store at Biltmore and decided to give it a whirl. It was Sunday afternoon last week and it wasn't busy.Wasn't empty either,but not only was I not greeted by the 2 sales women at the front of the shop,in fact they both turned away from me! As I meandered, I did see a skirt on a manniquen that I liked and wanted to try with a summer white crisp jacket also displayed on a different manniquen. I passed by a few more salespeople who when I got near,managed to turn their backs to me or to quickly engage someone else in conversation. Hell,I would have been happy if a security guard started paying attention to me.. I couldn't find the skirt or jacket anywhere on the racks,and went to seek out the help of the sales staff. I walked back up to the front of the shop where the skirt was on the manniquen,in the hopes of purchasing it.You would think at this point someone would ask if they could help me.I was obviously looking for something and someone who could assist. One of the women who turned her back to me when I walked in,saw me,I smiled,made eye contact and a bee line to her. I started to say "Hello" and she again turned her back and simply walked to the back of the store! I was a bit stunned.At first I figured I'd follow behind asking if she could help me forcing her to just deal,but I decided to not further embarrass myself. Kind of a shame as I did want the jacket and skirt,the paring being around 700.00... I walked over to Macy's,where they did try to assist,but only carry the casual sportswear line of Lauren,and informed me that what I was looking at could only be bought from a Lauren store. I guess I saved some money that day,but still,it was a pretty shitty way to outright profile what you think can't afford to shop in your store....

So I heard you could get yours shoes shined here...So I went to check it out. I had a pair of Born boots on and brought my Doc Marten MaryJanes .I've had the boots for a few years and wear them just about daily.The MaryJanes get their fair share of play as well and all the scuffs evidence that they are worn. Normally,I wouldn't venture into a "barber shop",the general vibe being overtly mancave,and not wanting to invade a space as such. Well,I got there shortly after they opened for the day,all the barber chairs filled and buzzing.Even so,I was greeted promptly,warmly and genuinely by several staff members.Tim,the staffer that handles the shoe shines greeted me and made me most comfortable as he worked on my boots while chatting happliy all the way. It's more than obvious,he loves what he does and enjoys his working enviroment. For a place I expected to feel out of my element in,everyone made sure to make me feel most welcome. As far as my boots and shoes,they look incredible! Got compliments on my boots the rest of the day! Thank you Tim! Thank you V's!!!!

Okay,so all my life I've wanted a little black cat.No little black cat had adopted me....Up until last week. So,I bring home said little black cat and he develops eye mung.You know,the mung that is full of icch and needs some anti mung tx. I get a call from this clinic offering me a free post adoption follow up visit. When I adopted the little black cat,I was told this would be available to me.So,I make an appointment...A SAME DAY appointment. I go. Staff really nice,warm,welcoming,down to earth and friendly. Now do I know nothing is "free"? Sure I do. I know while they may waive the office visit,I'm going to pay for whatever tx the little black cat needs. I know the last time I dealt with cat eye mung,the anti mung goop was about 12 clams. Well,this anti mung free trip cost me 75 simoleans... BUT.... It was well worth it in my opinion. Same day appointment.Check. Friendly staff.Check. Clean enviroment.Check. Dr.very patient and genuine.Check. Aggressive tx that completely knocked out the cat eye mung in 24 hours.CHECK. So,no goop. Injection of anti mung. Anti mung eye drops. Liquid suspension anti mung oral meds. 75 bucks. No pink eye going around the house? Priceless. Oh and PS on their website,they offer a free visit to all new patients if they mention they saw that on their website. As long as you go with the understanding that nothing is free,you're ahead of the game. Yeah,I'd go back.

Not that I'm a germaphobe,but a significantly negative experience with a simple manicure many years back has me handling all my mani/pedi needs myself. Every now and again(like once a year)I'll get my toenails professionally done,then I simply keep up on my own. I perused here and Kudzu for a nail salon and after looking at some with high revues,I just wasn't at all comfortable utilizing the services of places where I can't effectively communicate with staff due to the prevalent language barrier that is the norm for the nail salon industry. So,after a few look sees,I took a chance and booked an appointment with Salon Surreal. When I got there,I saw the wall of product and the bustling front desk. Even though there were a few others checking in,I was greeted immediatley and warmly. I was about 10 minutes early.In looking around I couldn't help noticing how loud the cutting floor seemed to be,even though shielded by the wall of product.You could see so many people buzzing around,it looked like a beehive to me.I didn't think "spa". To me,a spa is quiet and serene.This place was anything but that! So,about 5 minutes before my appointment time,Janea greets me and brings be back to the nail area. She's already got the station set up,nice hot(but not too hot)foot bath already set.Nice detail. I'm the only client back there so it's a very welcome difference from the cacophany of the front. Janea is very soft spoken and has a very light touch,which was perfect for me.She is also a consumate professional at what she does.The massage was a light touch as well,but very effective and soothing. I'm now going on week three and the pedicure still looks fresh with no chipping or dulling of the polish. I thought the price was a bit high for a basic pedicure,but with the first time discount here mentioned and honored,it brought the price point down to something more palatable. Since the pricing is a bit on the high side,I have to say,it will keep me away from more frequent visits. If I come across a coupon or another dicount offer,I will be back. For those of you wanting a very nice pedi experience,I do highly recomment Janea.

Tomorrow is my one year anniversary of dog ownership. It was time to get dogface'sannual checkup and shots. This is my second experience at this vet's office and it was just as amazing as the first time I was there a year ago. staff amazing,no wait,Doc incredible and supportive,dog wagged tail throughout whole thing. they really make you feel as if your pet is the only thing on their minds. Kudos for setting the bar so high!

I guess this place would be okay if they know you. If you're not in their computer,forget about buying shoes here. It doesn't matter if you know your size in a particular brand,they still won't sell them to you without making a specific appointment... Really?You're a retail location with an unlocked door;allowing the public in,but you need an appointment to buy stock shoes???? Or,did you just not want to sell to me? I realize I'm not your typical demographic,but understand you lost an almost 200.00 sale in the first place,in the second place,I will never be back,nor will I sing any praises to any other dancers looking for shoes or anything else. Maybe you have all the clientelle you need. If that's the case,lock your fucking door and only allow in whatever chosen few you deem worthy. It's a shame Phoenix is so limited in certain areas that shop keepers can come up with insane ridiculous rules because they know they corner the market on specific goods. I realize some might say"oh,but these are special dance shoes and must be fitted properly"..I get that...If someone had never been fitted,worn or bought prior.... But I knew what I was looking for as well as the size. If that is the case as well,they sell them online... Do I need to make an appointment to buy them online too????? Useless bullshit. Oh,PS; I did go elsewhere and was able to purchase what I needed with no goddamn appointment,no hassle and no princess attitude. I ended up buying more than just the shoes,which is why I can say that you lost an almost 200.00 sale... I was in and out in less than half an hour as well. If Macy's demanded appointments to buy clothes,everyone would be running around naked. That's probably not  attractive as reality that you might imagine...

Some relatives checked in here from to east coast on Wed.night.Staff very genuine and welcoming.Interior lobby comfortable and the guest rooms laid out well and spotless.Here's aHUGE perk though.They have a courtesy van that operates 24/7 and will take you to local resturants and bars and then you call and they pick you back up!!!This is a FREE service.So,we asked for the van to take us to a resturant at 11 pm on a Wednesday night,we had 9 people and within minutes we were whisked away to a family friendly dining option that was open till 2 am.Perfect!When were were done at 12:30 am,we called for the van and it was back for us in less than 5 minutes. The driver,ever patient and congenial even amongst the chaos of disoriented and over tired jet lagged family members and 4 small children,even took the time to suggest he get a few pics for us with our various cameras. I will recommend this place to folks coming into town and need to be close to the airport.

I figure since I'm on my way over there for an evening of fun filled events,I'd take a moment while my nails are drying to review the joint. I like it here.Comfy space,great staff,fun outgoing people.Inside is roomy enough,but the patio is home.They used to have a fire pit that was the ginchiest,but firepits plus  drunky people does not make for happy endings...So they did away with it making even more useable space.It's all good. Every now and again they grill up some burgers that are tasty too. See everyone who's going in a lil bit.

I actually give this one more star than I wanted just for the specific vet Dr.Marsh. So,I get home from getting my hair did and my next door neighbor is standing by his car looking a bit flustered. He'd just made an end of life appointment for his 17 year old blind and deaf and in ever and now rapidly decline health Min Pin. I put them in my car and drove them to the vet. Upon check in,the reception staff took care of everything so we could leave quickly once the bridge had been crossed. They put us in a room right away where we waited...and waited...and waited... Finally a tech came in and got the dog prepped.It felt like another eom until the vet came in. When he did,Dr.Marsh was very compassionate,made sure to take a great deal of effort and time to explain the process and what we could expect to witness. He stayed in the room with us for a good deal of time after the dog had passed. I tried to be understanding about the wait at that point. Dr. Marsh,thank you for making a difficult day a little less stressful.

This has been such a strange day.I hope it's all done at this point... So I ended up in their ER tonight at 7:45 pm on the recommendation of Urgent Care. A good possibility I fractured my nose. I got signed in pretty quickly,was triaged within 6 minutes of arrival and put into an ENT suite within 10 minutes or less. Trauma surgeon came in within the next 5 minutes,was personable,friendly and took the time to explain my injury to me. Because of the swelling,I have to wait a few days to see if corrective action will be neccessary. I was discharged with a fresh icepack and sent on my way by 9pm. Everyone I encountered from check in to check out was professional,courteous,friendly and reassuring. The facility was very clean with the exception of most of the denizens of the waiting room. Kudos,this was impressive.

The ONLY reason this place gets one star(aside from the fact that I can't give it NO stars)is that the security staff is cool when I bring  my dog for early am training.Actually I think they might be relieved as he is a working dog,and probably looks like added security. One morning I was going in with him and all the crackheads who hang by the Bank of America ATM were already amassed.One of them asked me"Hey.is that a po-leese dog?"My reply was "Sort of.He's a drug dog trained to find meth." I never saw so many disability claiming neer do wells scatter so fast. They were still gone when I went to leave. The place is sketchy,nasty,and the parking lot is NOT safe.More often than not,skells are perusing it looking in vehicle windows and trying doors. The malwart there is one of the nastier ones I've been in,so much so,that even with gas prices being what they are,I will drive further away for a less frightening shopping experience. The shops in the actual mall part are gehttofab,so if you really need a chola version of Marilyn Monroe on a t shirt,there are a few places that sell really nice ones. There's one shop that sells really cheap costumne jewelry,but for some unknown reason,the place REEKS of formaline.I don't know how anyone can actually work there and not incur liver damage from whatever the toxic waste they're storing there is. The excure for a food court is terrifying.Yes,I'd like the deep fried ptomaine on a stick with a side order of Shigella please. Ick ick ick and ick.

They get top stars just for making sure we knew they weren't putting the rush on us! So we get there kinda late on Sunday evening,no worries... We're treated very well,staff warm and genuine. We both opt for different types of personal pizza. I got the cheeze...Simple,simple,but good and tasty. I never knew this place existed and look foward to going back and tryong something else!

I unfortunatly had to go in this zoo 2 weeks before x mas. I was going to purchase only one small thing.A brocade box to put a glass ornament into. It was 5 bux. I go towards the front to get in line and overhear one worker on the floor telling anotherone something about the check out line being 60 people long. I guessed they were discussing some shopping experience. They were. Mine. The line snaked through menswear all the way around to luggage. They weren't exaggerating! There were only 2 cashiers on duty. On a Saturday at 1 pm. 2  weeks before x mas.... I put the little 5 dollar brocade box down and left. And they say we're in a depressed economy....

Okay,this update is for 2 specific incidents with 2 very different outcomes,but the weaker is cancelled by the stellar leaving my review at 5 stars. I wanted to get dogface one of those "I'm a big scary dog" spiked collars.They're like 60 clams.(a better spent 60 clams as opposed to the Smelly Dog 60 clam coat)Anyhoo.This is in Criptown Maul,so they lock the good shit up.Good shit being a 60 clam big scary dog spikey collar. Don't judge me...You know it's a fair statement.Even if you refuse to admit it. So,I find someone to unlock the collar to make sure it fits. Well,it don't.AND it's brown...No no no...Must not be.This must be a black leather big scary dog spikey collar.My dog will be Dog Halford.My dog will be hellbent for leather. I ask key guy if they have any in his size in black that's not locked up in the display rack.Well Lazy Farts tells me they don't make that collar any bigger and it only comes in brown...Hmmm.I doubt that. I go to another Petsmart and get it.In black,In his size.Fucker lost a 60 clam sale. Oh...and guess what...I happen to know someone in upper management in the Petsmart Corporation.Guess what he knows too now... You never know who you're waiting on Mr.Lazy Farts Key Holder... Now for part Deux of this update. On another occasion,I bring dogface to the groomie area,without an appointment or clue.(I take him to charity car washes to wash him.Cheaper than a groomie and money goes to some needy something or other.)All I need are his doenails did.They can do it!Check in groomie girl real pleasant,gave a shit,and was engaged and knowledgable.All the groomie girls were extra cool and human.You could get the idea they all went out for girls night out after work from time to time.Just the way they got along,a symbiosis if you will. So,after looking at dog's nails,she comes back and suggests a slightly different service and the reason why.Reasonable,go for it.Dog was a bit nervous,but they handled him so well.His toenails all did and nice,dog more comfy now. I will go back for that again! Oh,and he was wearing his big scary dog collar,the one they don't make in his size or black on that occasion... I didn't see Mr.Lazy Farts though.maybe he had made a bed of excelsior in the back and was sleeping on it. Tee hee hee.

Wow.Alternative to the mallwalk anyone? This place has the makings of a time capsule for all generations. They have mostly other people's old crap,but you know what they say. Someone else's old crap may be someone else's foshizzle. You do have to know your prices on old crap,because some sellers think their old crap has been shit out from the golden goose when that simply is not the case. Having said that,you could easily find some old crap of someone else's that you want to take home as new to you foshizzle. The staff is helpful,warm,friendly.We hit the "show me this crap" button a few times,and an attendant seemed to appear out of nowhere to assist,each time happily chatting away with us.The staff seems to enjoy working there. So my friend who brought me there went home scoring a huge black glossy swan planter with a hideous from the 80's dusty black and white flower derangement. Yeah,it sat on my lap on the ride home.I felt as if I absconded with a centerpience from an episode of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. The day was full of foshizzle.

Holy crapoley Batman,this place is full o the bunk. This is the bright sparkly faerie dusty get a pic with your aura(yeah,,,really)tree hugging hippy kind of place wthout Grateful Dead stuff. All the wannabes,hipsters,and folks who are trying to be oh so exotic and esoteric can come here and get readings in full view of everyone. Really awkward to try looking at books while someone's marriage hangs in the balance or someone else was Cleopatra TOO in a past life. Was everyone who pays for a past life look see famous?Didn't anyone shovel shit back in the day? This place is so phony it's downright laughable. It's so phony even the staff doesn't have the nerve to even make eye contact. Or maybe they sense I'm a chi thief setting upon stealing their chakra life force of chi.Yeah,I'll take a bagel with cream chi please. Maybe I'm there to steal their souls. I know they can tell. I'm not one of the corn people. Vision Quest,just for the record,you suck.

Went this evening with relatives from the east coast.One member of our party of 4 is an avid brewery visitor,visiting microbreweries whenever he travels.I don't drink at all,but he's quite the beer connesseuir.So he did one of their beer sampler thingies and enjoyed a few of the brews.He said he's had better though. The resturant was empty and our server Ryan was incredibly polished and professional.He knew not only the Brewery/resturant's offerings,he was happy to make suggestions as well. He knew a lot about the Tempe area's fast paced history which endeared him to all of us.He was engaged,present and it was obvious he made it a point of bringing excellence to the table.Yes,pun intended. The food was plentiful,fresh and tasty. The prices fair for the portion and quality. Would I be back?Yes,under similar circumstances. Personally I despeise all that is Mill Ave with it's frat boy and girl mentality and am hard pressed to venture east of 24th street. I wasn't expecting much from a place I deemed "touristy",but was ever so pleasantly surprised!

If you like eating good food in a disco with the beautiful plastic people who all look exactly the same,then this place is for you! If you like a really great burger and spectacular service,this place is also for you. I like the clean ambiance and their art installations. The food and service is always on point. I have to work myself up to go though,because for a resturant,the music is a bit on the loud side making dinner conversation almost impossible.Unless you like talking loud over a dinner table,me not so much. That's the reason for the knocked off star on elsewhise a 5 star experience. I find it somewhat comical that people will size up any new fish upon entering like some sort of doucebag/douchette jail holding pen. I know I don't have the blonde hair,capped teef,bolt on boobies,nor am I attired in a slinky tube dress(which should be outlawed.Especially the "one shouldered"ones),however I am not the zoo animal on the loose either.Well,maybe I am.Maybe I just happen to be a very glamourous squid. For all you know,I could be a Hugo Boss wearing axolotl. Or mayhaps a binturong in Chanel. No...I don't own any ugly assed mofugly Coach bags... I have taste. I'm here for the burger. Why? Because meat is murder. Tasty tasty murder....

Nice lil spot here... Have walked past it many many times but never went in. I don't drink coffee,have an interwebs connection at home,and really have no reason to go... Until a friend checked in today so I walked over to socialize.It's comfy and cozy both inside and out. I never know what to order on the rare occasion I do find myself in a coffee place like this,but I do know it'll be expensive. So I ask about iced teas.The lady behind the counter who was uber friendly and nice recommeneded a few different things and I went with some herbal thingamajig. Got a BIG cup full of light goodness.I was expecting to hear something like 5 bux,but it was only 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! would I go back?I might rabbit,I might. Except some of of the denizens were of the hipster faux hippie persuasion,and well,I didn't care all too much for the great unwashed the first time around and I would prefer my tea hippieless here in the new millenium. If my friend checks in again,I'd follow him over. Just wouldn't go on my own.

I was doing the First Friday thing last night,and wandered in here. They had live entertainment to clebrate their 2 year anniversary. There was a good crowd and it soon became apparent why. The performer was Jackie Fontaine. Okay,I said "Who"?too. I have to tell you,this guy was fun,funny and kept a perfect pace. He was hosting a spin the wheel gme show where everyone who wanted to play got a chance and everyone who played won something. The store was much fun as well. If you like stuff from the 70's,this is the place for you. If you really need to replace your photo of a nude Burt Reynolds in repose,they have it here! Miss your Marsha Brady polyesther? Here. Going to the disco,need something to wear? Here. Feeling a little Twiggy and need that mod swing dress? Here. David Bowie reprising Diamond Dogs? Here. The prices were reasonable enough that I was able to afford two dresses. I will definitely be back! To Retro Ranch,congrats on your second anniversary! A major coup in this economy. Thankyou for throwing a party and bringing in talent that was PERFECT for the venue,and thankyou for inviting everyone in to be part of it.

What a cool place.Was there with a large group of friends on Friday evening.I wish I remembered our server's name as he was all kinds of wonderful!He knew his stuff,was able to handle all our orders and crosstalk efficiently and effortlessly,made sure we had whatever we needed and always seemed to be right there when anything was needed.Even with a full resturant and other tables to contend with. The food was delish,and the dessert was great. The only reason I left off a star is because my dessert was 7.00... A bit high for a slice of cheesecake... Yes,it was homemade and wonderful,but 7 bucks???Sheesh...

Now that the weather has cooled down to a balmy 105 degrees,and First Friday is "officially"back,I decided to do the Melrose Stroll. For those out there who would prefer to avoid the crowds,difficult parking and chaos that can be some of the fun of FF in the Roosevelt district,please consider Melrose. This small strip of 7th Avenue between Indian School and Camelback can be considered sparse in comparison,however what is along this strip is well worth looking into.Especially on First Friday when the street takes on a whole different flavor. On to the gallery. Exposed tends to feature sensuality driven artists,although that's not exclusively what's shown. Greg(the owner)does an amazing job of keeping up a lot of variety and diversity in both style and subject matter of artists he chooses to feature . There are paintings,sculpture,objects de arte,jewelry and even a really nice selection of wall clocks that are quite unexpected and 100% fun. This is a great place to pick out a unique gift for that hard to shop for recipient. There is something for every price point as well so you don't have to worry that investing in art will break the bank. Greg is a wonderful host,pillar of the community,an all around nice guy. for those who may be bear aware,friendly,or family,you will find a most welcome place here.

Was there late on Wednesday.I think we were the only table occupied in the entire place,which was fine because there were 4 kids in our party.They had coloring books,crayons and sippy cups for the kids which were great and kept them occupied.The waitress was friendly and attentive . The food was nasty.Maybe they're known for their pizza,but I had the chicken sliders which were the consistancy of hocky pucks.The fries tasted old as well. So,they get 2 stars for the crayons and wait staff....

This dog park gets one star.Why?Because the last time I went,some piece of shit broke into just about every car in the parking lot to steal whatever they could.So much broken glass from side windows everywhere. It used to be okay before this incident,but a busy parking lot in borad daylight and some vulture lies in wait? Yeah,I'm done here.

This place gets one star. Why? Because of the proliferation of snotnose owners.That's why. Classic Phoenix ridden Children of The Corn mentality. They don't know you? You're not welcome. Hostile,rude,obnoxious,condescending group of assholes who congregate in their asshole pods to size up the new entrants into the park. Gods forbid your dog goes to play with any of theirs either. Between the nasty remarks,dirty looks and them pulling their oh so hi falutin mutts away when play does ensue,I find it a dissapointment at best to have to take dogface here. I have never seen this level of anti social behavior anywhere else in the world. This dog park's overall mentality is a prime microcosm example of what I despise about Phoenix.

REDEMPTION! So after my dissappointing recent history with the 32nd street location,I decided to try this location before saying goodbye to Community Tire all together. So I make an appointment yesterday for an oil change.I go this afternoon.My appointment's at 3:30,but I got there about 15 minutes early.They have my car on the lift at about 3:20! All done before 4 pm!!! So the service advisor (Witness is his name)lets me know my car's ready. So....now that other shoe...the one that's dangling from the cliff waiting to drop.... I do the walk of doom to the counter. It felt like slow motion.... What's it going to be this time for my less than 2 year old vehicle? Shocks? Transmission? Bo weevel infestation? Breadmold? "Okay,here ya go."... Here ya go?Go where? In my car? With just an oil change???? there's no ticking money bomb???? No leaky check book valve??? The credit lines aren't dangerously frayed??? Witness informed me the car looked fine. Well,it kind of should with it's new brakes and fluids before 50,00 miles...lol I must have looked shocked. I felt the need to tell him I was very pleasantly surprised that the upsell mentality had not made it over to this location. I know times are tough,I know people are watching their pennies closer than before and I understand smaller businesses need to up their bottom line if they want to stay in business,especially if less people are in the position to own and maintain a motor vehicle,not to mention the possibility of fewer commercial accounts in these uncertain times,so I was reluctant to write a negative review of a company where I have met the owner and hold him in high regard. Than you Witness for single handedly restoring my faith and making me feel comfortable again with a company I didn't  want to stop patronizing. See you in about 3000 miles!

Dear Phoenix, Burn in Hell. For a sentence of 10 years (now completed thank gods!!!)I was relegated to the most anti social city on the planet. A city that no matter what I did,The Children of The Corn knew I did not know Isaac,Malachai or He Who Walks Behind The Rows. A city where employers are empowered to treat the free range staffers no better than garbage paying just above poverty level wages even in professional capacities. A city where the denizens are called  to be rude beyond belief for no reason other than the entitlement that "they can". Whatever you do,don't call them on their asshattery lest you get instantaneously branded as the bad guy and the proliferation of bully/toadie mentality rallies around to bash. A city where independant business struggles against a deafening sheeple of Applebee's and Chilli's mentality because the education level in this state is 49 out of 50 where the ignorant cannot,or refuses to recognize individuality and quality. A city that where the would be bullies self proclaimed "cool kids club"(really,you're HOW old????)once confronted on their unacceptable behaviors,backpeddle or outright blame or lie by denying actions. Most everyone I met here who were reasonable,personable,intelligent were transplants from someplace else.... So,City of Phoenix,kindly go fuck yourself and the asshole mentality you foster,approve and encourage.

As far as I know,my dog may never have been professionally groomed. I used to have access to a back yard and hose and would shampoo him myself. In looking around for someplace I could wash him since I no longer have a backyard or  a hose,I was a bit surprised to find local facilities being upwards of 15 clams just to wash a dog! I checked into Smelly Dog and found it wasn't that much more to have someone else not only wash,but clip dogface's toenails. I wander in at 9 am this morning.Was greeted cheerfully and put into their computer system.The lady was very nice and explained how things worked after asking about my dog. Unlike some of the other reviewers here who's dogs are accessory items,my hound is a working dog.He's a real dog.Not some fru fru tu tu wearing big eyed loud cat in a dog suit. He's a dogly dog.He could easily do an Old Spice for dogs commercial or be the Marlboro Dog or the Brawny Dog. He could even be a Dog of Finland dog. He just needed to be de-funked. I warned the lady who checked me in that I didn't know how'd he react in the situation,and she calmly assured me they're used to anything and everything. Off they go. I decided to just hang out there and wait.They have a cafe table with 2 chairs outside and it was a nice morning for it. When he was done,she came out to get me. He was un-funked,soft,and happy. She even went so far as to tell me how he did with some specific details so I would know next time! It was a great first experience and well worth the price and I will be happy to bring him back there next time he neads his nails clipped or needs another bath!

I visited your store only once. Once was definitely enough. I can understand wanting to protect your inventory,but my purse stays with me. AT ALL TIMES. I went in wanting to purchase a substantial amount of double aurora borealis crystal beads.I had a very specific project in mind and instead of going the mail order route through Fire Mountain Gems (which is what I ended up doing),I attempted to shop local. Not only was I demanded to check my purse,it wasn't even remotely politely asked that I do so. The woman who demanded it of me was incredibly rude and condescending treating me as if I was a criminal and of course she expected me to steal you blind. Still,I made the trip to BFE,and I wanted the beads so I asked her if she carried specifically what I was looking for.I figured she could bring them to me and ring me up on the spot as I no longer had any desire to peruse the store. She said she could answer my questions AFTER I check my purse.Again in the same accusitory manner. At which point,I simply turned around and left. It's amazing you manage to stay in business with that attitude,unless of course I wasn't the demographic you want as a customer. Oh,and my vehicle,for the record,was not towed from your location. It was your post masked as "review"that welled up the negative experience for me.I'm sad to see my negative experience was not solitary. If you didn't post that,I wouldn't have even bothered to review your business. I think it's a very sad commentary that you defend a negative review with the excuse of sour grapes on the part of the writer. Maybe that person did get towed?Maybe not. To assume that reviewer did,speaks volumes about your mindset. 80 miles round trip for me for that. Oh,something I forgot to say as I walked out of your establishment that day.... Fuck you.

Rejoined  after a year + hiatus. Clean,neat,.all machines work,towels and lockers provided. Kind of a noob at the free weight thing and am real self conscious still at working out around all the guys who know what they're doing.I feel like an awkward fish out of water.I'll just have to get over myself on that one.

What happened here???? I go away for a bit and come back and the place turns to Clownville? Tangible,I've got to say I'm disappointed. The prices have gone up and the customer service has gone to shit. It's gotten overrun with gymbunnies/rats who meander near the equipment doing not much more than staring at themselves flex. Then there's the proliferation of independant personal trainers. There's no one on staff that can tell you how to use the machines if you're new,and if you can't afford or want to use an independant trainer,you're left to flounder and feel foolish. To the faux Jillian trainer,could you stop yelling at your clients from across the damn gym?This is not your reality show,you sound like an ass.I don't go to the gym to be subjected to your showboating and frankly,you're obnoxious. Unfortunatley,this is the only game in town for me at the moment. I only hope as the holidays near,the place will empty out somewhat. I used to love this gym,now I simply tolerate it.

This is a review in 2 parts.It's a bit of a journey.  I'm reviewing this,which is my old location and will be reviewing my new location. A few years back I was introduced to Community Tire at a festival where they had a booth.Spin the wheel and win a free something or other. well,who doesn't love a spinning wheel,and I won a free oil change. So I go. Great service,friendly staff,incredible management. Have been a customer at this location for almost 4 years. Never had a problem,never had any products or services suggested that weren't neccessary,no hard sell. Fast foward to this year. Got a new to me car. A 2010 american car.From the dealership.where they do all the preventive maintenence stuff before they sell it to you. My first oil change with my new baby. All new staff.No big,same owner,I'm sure I'm good. 43,000 miles. "Oh,you need a power steering flush.The fluid is dirty". I've owned this car for 3 months... That's a pricey service. Guess where I'm going?Right back to Ford to have them take care of it. Ford shows me and tells me this service wasn't neccessary,however they do the service for me gratis so I can have peace of mind. Next oil change at 46,000 miles. "Oh you need new brakes and new tires" WTF???? At 46,000 miles????? "Here's the quote" Tires alone were almost 200..EACH! Um...No. I do let them do the brakes as I wanted to upgrade to ceramics anyway,just didn't think I needed them at 46,000 miles... I tell them hell no on the tires. Get the car back,drive for a few days and my tire pressure light comes on. I'm near Discount Tire,so I pull in to have them take a look see. 2 tires are fine,one is underinflated(even though Community claimed to check)then the 4th tire is at 51 psi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My tire is supposed to be at 32....WTF again???? I have sent folks to this location for as long as I've been going. The ex had similar experiences with "needing"services once this new team came on board.So have a few other friends who I've sent there. We're all asking each other what the hell happened? So now my car is at a 51,000 mile and guess what,I need an oil change and am dreading going back.I've lost trust,but who can you trust anymore???? I Well,all I know is I ain't going back to that location,I will try another to give this family owned business another shot....

Same bar/same people/different name. The bar is now named "The Anvil". Is there a way to change that here? It could make things confusing. This is my Saturday night spot for great place/great staff/great folks.

Drove myself there with a bag of frozen peas on my possibly fractured and very swollen nose.They were the only urgent care in the area still open at 7:45 on a Saturday night. Not only did they get me IMMEDIATE attention,they didn't even worry about getting my billing info before getting me seen. They had 2 medical staffers take a fairly thourough look see and sent me to the ER. While I was in the room,I filled out the paperwork,but because they couldn't do anything for me,they didn't even ask for a co-pay. I thought that was impressive seeing as they did perfom an exam and discuss my injury with me. They will most likely bill my insurance,but to not ask for the co-pay was incredibly human of them.

Okay,for the reviewers that noticed the alcohol section here,it belies your immediate surroundings. I thought Bahsa's were supposed to be a step up from Fry's or Safeway,however this one here will henceforth be known as CrackBasha's. What a nasty scuzzy tweaky place this is...It would behoove one to peruse and partake of the alcohol just to deal with the rest of the store. The lighting was akin to Bowery Bar ambiance,and yes,there was the line with only 2 cashiers and not even self checkouts. I'm all for quaint and ye oldee tymee and such,but this location is icchy. There were people wandering the aisles that looked like they should be in an M.Night Shamalamadingdong  creepcast. I can see it now... The Apple People... You remember when you were a kid and a craft project was to carve faces out of apples then let them sit and shrivel into old creepy faces? Well boys and girls,that's what happens when you consume way too much meth.You turn into one of The Apple People. Destined to set upon wandering the CrackBasha's for that loaf of pumpernickle bread you can neither afford to buy or eat because you are a crackhead and have no toofeses in your shriveled up apple people head. Just say "No" to CrackBasha's. Oh and don't see the movie when it comes out...It will go nowehere just like the Apple People of the CrackBashas.

Finally found this place. I had the cherry.It was GREAT!!!! I got the medium and it was a big damn medium for 2.50. This is the perfect snack for the heat we're subjected to. There was a family of 4 being helped when I got there and another family of I think 3 arrived shortly after me. There was only the one guy working. He seemed to be a bit frazzled...

I'm not one for coffee houses,but Hob Nobs isn't just about the coffee. Their food is great as is the staff and comfort factor here. If you like salads,I recommend the Hob Nob Cobb. Their desserts are tasty and plentiful.

Dear Cherry Bar, You suck out loud. You suck so bad the old owner had to take the bar back. That's how badly you sucked. From the constant identity crisis,to the bad DJ's,to the bar staff that made up prices entirely on whims,Cherry,you suck. I'm so glad you're gone. Welcome back Friends Again. Thanks for saving Phoenix from this nightmare.

Doc Marten's 20 eyelet knee high comfy boots. Took me forever to ladderlace them. They are cheaters as they do have side zippers. I guess the Trad Gods looked down upon me for it and decided to smite me. Pleading dyslexia as the reason for the need of zippers in the first place did not appease the Gods. As they pointed a craggy hand at the zipper,let out a giggle and a snarl... BLAMMO! Spontaneous Zipper combustion. Dammit. Shit. Fuck. Now what... Do I send them back to Fleet Street? Do I retire them? Do I get all punk rawk and put them back together with safety pins or duct tape? No... I bring them to Tony's Shoe Repair. Shoe Genuis looked at the boot,then gave me that knowing glance of "Ah....Trad God Smiting,yes?" I answered with my eyes alone,the look of zipper shame that said "Yes". He told me the zipper would need replacing and he'd try and get it as close as possible to the original but couldn't guarantee it would match it's mate. I was okay with that,I feel kind of lost without my Doc's... Besides,it's still better than safety pins or duct tape. Less than 24 hours later,I go pick up my boot. O.M.G. It's as if the smiting never happened! It was a miracle. Tony's must have a Lourdes of Zippers grotto in the back of the shop or something. I can picture thousands of broken zippers hanging from the rocks... Speaking of rocks,Tony's Shoe Repair and their resident Shoe Genius rocks! Thank you Thank you Thankyou!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

WOW. Beautiful property,nicely appointed apartments with a very homey feel. Great details all around the grounds. Very professional and welcoming staff. Rents reasonable for what you get. Only downside,at the edge of Cracklandia bordering on Upper Meth Heights. Yes,you have to run the gauntlet to get home. You get to shop at either CrackFry's locations and the Tweaker's CVS is close by. If you can get past that,you'll do well at Orion. My friend who was apartment shopping could not though. It would be perfect if this property was located in a better part of town. They definitely ae a bright spot for where they are.

Well,if you like goth/industrial/80's this is sadly the only game in town. don't get me wrong,I like the club fine. Staff has always been respectful and even nice. Club is beautifully appointed,neat,clean and comfy. Easy peasy parking. Sound system..Well it IS a Funktion One after all. That alone is worth the 5.00 cover. The DJ can be spotty hit and miss,but when it's the only game in town,it is what it is. I've found the set lists on Fridays more enjoyable.It's all about what you like I guess.Everyone's going to have a different opinion. Here's why I knocked off a star,maybe it's not the fairest star I've ever knocked off a review,but here it is. I go. I dance.I go home. I don't fuck with anyone,I don't expect anyone to fuck with me. I don't do drama and am most content being a G.D.I. So,why do some of the chicks there try and give me shit?I have no fucking clue. I guess they're just insecure. I find it comical when I get cock blocked on the off chance some random guy dances anywhere near me. Dear hose bag,if he's got more eyeliner on than you,he's not going home with you either idiot.He's going home with some other emo boi.But you just keep living the dream. I'm just dancing.That's it.Dancing. So leave me the fuck alone and go have drama with someone else.I'm not for it. One star knocked off for the amount of self important assholes who think for whatever reason,they own the deed to this place. This is why I wish there was at least one other option.

Not a fan of the stores. Phone customer service for Verizon?Stellar,going into one of the stores,not so much. Finally upgrading my technology had me calling customer service for device info and comparison. They put me on with a tech person who was great. Laura. She spent a good deal of time imparting info and even going so far as to let me know what devices come back with issues. I thank her and armed with the info I can actually venture into a store and say,"Gimmie one of these,and one of those"and get the hell out of dodge... Enter my poor salesperson Jason. Jason,my apologies you got stuck with me. Poor man had to just about teach me how to read.Damn phone does everything but the dishes.Hell if I have clue one on how to use it. The woman working at the computer next to Jason's station makes a remark that he's "not going to be done"with my transaction "in time"...I guess maybe for his lunch,break or maybe even going home for the day. She kept trying to get him to hand me off to her. He declined and kept working with me. That's another thing. You can't just go buy a phone. The process takes almost as long as buying a car! I get it though...Program this,get my contacts from here to there... Log everything into my account and reciepts long enough to reach the moon. Not only did Jason not pass me off to snarkgirl(for which I am completely thankful)he spent another felt like 45 minutes teaching me the basics of the phone. He taught me some extra stuff that was nifty and even told me about free classes Verizon offers to learn more about the phones! Jason,whatever you were late for,I am grateful for you taking so much time and for your patience with me. I will be contacting Verizon corporate as well in the hopes that exemplary staff members get recognition.

I can't believe there's only 2 reviews for Fit Health!!!Don't know why the one was filtered either. I have been going to Dr.Patric for going on 3 years now. This is a family practice that handles a bit of ,well,everything,and handles everything well. You won't be left waiting ad infinitum before seeing a medical professional here.You won't be treated like a co-pay.... The practice focuses on treating people like....wait for it....HUMAN BEINGS.What a concept,huh? You'll never be rushed out(unless it's discovered you're having a true medical emergency and need the benefit of an ambulance). The office is spotless clean,welcoming and private. It's obvious they care about the patients. I have sent several people to this facility,among them a few who were incredibly physician phobic. All have had positive experiences and some have even made Fit Health their go to,like I have. Oh,and no appointment????Just walk in.... Yes,I said it...they take walk ins. I have done just that on several occasions and still have never had any kind of medical office waiting game. Go see Dr.Patric and see what medical care should be.

I don't understand how this place has only one review! Anyhoo.I go in this morning feeling like such a rookie. Going for my endorsement this weekend and needed proper boots,a helmet and gloves.Andrea was so unbelievably nice and helpful without "selling".She knew the products,was able to give me some pointers and options. I was a little reluctant going in as a first timer for safety gear and not wanting to come across as some douchette poseur. Their stock and prices are great and I even got an added discount for being retired MOS. Looks like I'm off to a good start on my next chapter. Thank you Andrea!

so I've been here 3 times now. First time a friend brought me as she knew one of the staff. Fabulous service and great food for a reasonable price. Second time,pretty much the same. Third time,great service,food was good. Was dining with 3 companions and they managed to get all our orders slightly wrong even though confirming them at the outset. One companion ended up with another dish all together. All the food was good,we were all hungry and posession is 9/10 of the law. Good thing I didn't have my heart totally set on what I ordered or I might be disappointed. I'll certainly be back for another mystery breakfast.

Won tickets from KDKB to see a concert there. The venue is big with indoor/outdoor space available so one can keep moving when the trolls get too close. The staff was amazing and attentive. Some sloppy drunk ass guy proceeded to try and hit on me while his girfriend was in the bathroom. I ignored him(easy to do when there's a live band 10 feet away),girlfriend comes out of the bathroom,sees boyfriend not where she left him,but attempting to chat me up,girlfriend gives ME the stinkeye.As if I'd want her drunk ass mess of a boyfriend.NOT.She says some stupid shit to me about it,to which I laugh at her and tell her to put a leash on her dog and hose it off. I got my own personal bouncer for the rest of the evening. Kudos for running a tight ship and looking out for your patrons. On this particular night,I did have to park in the overflow parking which was a bit of a roundabout hike to the club. That was an ass pain. Would I go back? Probably not.... It's out of the way (for me) and people got drunk real early in the evening which can make for an overall obnoxious night. The staff and venue were good though,so I'll give it an extra star as drunk jackasses shouldn't bring down the review,especially since they did look out for me being a solo flier that evening.

Looked at a one bedroom here a few weeks back. Staff was very accomodating and the grounds were nice. The apartment was small and poorly laid out. The rent was ridiculously high for where it is..... All botox no substance.

. On the advice of my personal trainer who happens to have just joined because he lives near the location,I went to join as well.We do our training sessions at my business location and not in any commercial gym.We are friends as well and he was just letting me know about an inexpensive off site location that's central to everything I do except work. So,I go in.There's 2 women behind the check in desk,and they're each checking in one person as I arrive.They both look up and see me there,and the first one who is done checking in the last person all of a sudden gets real busy staring at her cash register as if it's going to do a trick.She is pretending to do some function,but she's not good at pretending... She waits until the other counter person is done and as I walk up to her,the pretender is of course done with her invisible task. Nice.... So The counter person who's telling me about the gym asks if I want to look around and I say no,I just need to sign up. This confuses her.So I explain my trainer is a member and has suggested this gym to me. All of a sudden,another woman appears and first wants to know why I wouldn't want a Lime membership and I explain there's no one I need to bring with me,and none of the other locations are near anywhere I ever am,so a basic membership will be fine. She begins to attempt to hard sell me on the Lime membership and again I tell her I can't get value for myself from it. It is a great deal and if it would be something I could use,I would have had no issue opting for it. Then she begins to chastise me about working out with someone who's not one of YouFit's trainers.She goes on to scold me, that if I am caught working out with someone,my memberhip would be revoked. I understand everyone has rules and liabilities they have to consider,but I really didn't need to be spoken to as if I was a 5 year old caught with my hand in the cookie jar. I really don't expect a lot from a place with such bare bones facilities and rock bottom pricing,but what I won't  tolerate is that kind of treatment.I don't care how cheap the gym is,nothing is worth being berated like that. I would suggest the slightest bit of courtesy  and customer service training will go a long way. YouFit,I have changed your name to YouSuck. I will gladly pay more to not  have to set foot into another YouSuck location ever again.

I wrote to their corporate,and they did respond with an apology and the offer of 2 month free membership. I appreciate the offer,but did decline. I am hopeful that they'll use my letter as constructive,give their employees better training(or screen potential hires better). Because my experience there was so incredibly negative,I am leaving this review at one star.

This is the location inside Scottsdale Fashion Square in the food court. Was here today shortly before noon,it wasn't crowded,in fact no one was in line at all and I wondered if I was their first customer of the day. My reciept indicates I was the 38th sale rung so they'd had a few patrons prior to me. The lady that started me off was very nice.Cheerful greeting me and such.As my sandwich moved down the line,the scenario changed drasticly.The guy who finshed making the sandwich was more than transparent in his hatred for being there and his distain towards me.He literally threw the ingredients and dressings on and all over the sandwich,bread,paper it was in,making it just a mess.He glared at me the whole time as if I killed his family and their cat.Now mind you,there was no precidence to this behavoir whatsoever.I certainly didn't bark my request at any of them,nor was I short,dismissive or abusive in any manner.I have much Respect for those forced to work retail/fast food etc as they are truly crappy jobs so I am always sure not to be their angry,snotty,unpleasant customer. So now I'm on to pay.The next guy I get is equally non plussed and on the verge of anger as he mumbles something and rings me up.He proceeds to put the wrapped sandwich in the plastic bag,shove it across the counter at me as he throws my change on the counter.Never making any eye contact. I feel bad for the lady who was stuck with these two disgruntled jackasses. Remember emo bois...It's down,not across.... I filled out the survey on Subway's website but am not interested in their free cookie for doing so.
