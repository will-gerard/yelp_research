I came here for lunch and had the okra dish with chicken. There was something really odd about it - like they used dirty oil or a dirty pan for the stir-fry. I was quite disappointed. The bathroom was also a bit dirty. I think for great Malaysian food in the US you have to go to the DC area or California.

I usually have to connect here and it's not too bad. It's a bit sprawling but it's clean. I like the rocking chairs and free wifi as well as the live piano player they sometimes have by the sushi bar. Plus, there's a Pinkberry! It's at the entrance to terminal D. I can't speak for customs, parking, or going through security because I've only had connections here.

I wouldn't come here for pizza, because the pizza is not NY style and didn't look that great from what I saw available on the buffet. However, I will definitely return here for the calzones and stromboli. They offer one of the best calzones I've ever had, with a slightly crispy crust. Not heavy or greasy. Try the house special - pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and onion - with mozzarella and ricotta. Only $6.49. Lunch service was speedy and attentive.

Not bad for an airport and a good choice if you're passing through and want a solid meal and a true taste of the Carolinas. I opted for the turkey on this day so I can't speak for the pork or brisket, but they looked good. The collard greens were fine and the Mac 'n Cheese was fantastic. The hush puppies weren't great, but the fried pickle was a nice surprise. The ladies behind the counter keep the line moving. Tip: Pass on the BBQ sauce that the ladies offer behind the counter and use the vinegar-based sauce down by the cash register. Drench your meat and collards in it!

This is pretty much the perfect bar for me. Hip but not pretentious crowd; cute guys; friendly, down-to-earth bartenders; perfect lighting; good DJs (the live bouzouki on top of recorded tracks was a bit weird, but I give them props for trying); free, help-yourself water; and 20% off everything on Sundays.  I had my first absinthe experience here and will never forget it. The perfect place to lose your absinthe virginity if you so desire.
