Order salmon and asparagus. The asparagus was burnt, salmon OK nothing to brag about. That dish shouldn't have left the kitchen that way. The waitor was nice, but he should have said something regarding the asparagus, like let me get you a new order when he placed the plate down in front of me. The waitor offered a new order once I said, I wasn't paying for the asparagus. A little too late. I was ready to leave. I'm not returning. It wasn't impressive for what you pay for. I don't mind paying for a good meal, but I expect it to be well worth the price.

Awesome!!!! Love the old school candy and that Thrifty icecream Malted Crunch. There is an assortment of icecream to choose from. Chocolate covered cones and bowls and many toppings. Come get your water an ice and your favorite yummy treat. If your are a health nut then you will love there smoothies with your choice of supplements or just get a blizzard!

I liked this facility.  The staff was very nice. SARA THE PA was very thorough and asked if I had any questions. She wasn't in a hurry like most.

It's always yummy pizza and the have gluten free pizza as well. Nothing like a cold beer and a delicious pizza on a hot AZ day.

We ordered the Insanity Sushi Rolls and California Rolls. Both were very good for my first time eating sushi. Loved the Spicy Chicken bowl and the gyoza. Highly recommend this restaurant.  The food is delicious and artistic.  The only thing that wasn't so good was the waiter.  He never came back to see if we needed anything or if everything was okay.

Oh so heavenly sweet, come and pick your treats. This is a throw back to your youth. I bought some big Chew, Bubble Gum Cigs and some assortment of goodies. I'll be zooming around with all this sugar....

Loved the ambiance. The lobster and the fillet mignon was delicious.  Classy atmosphere but laid back and casual.  Highly recommended!

The bomb! Best chicken, brisket and collard greens I EVER HAD!!!!! This is a must try. If you like southern flare check this place out. You gotta try the Blazin Bowl! The meat melts in your mouth. "YUMMY"!!!!!

Absolutely Devine! The steak just melted in my mouth.  I didn't give  5 stars because I like it when your server has a big personality. It would have made more of an impact.  Service is always key to return guests. Whom ever cooks the steak you did awesome! ! If you put A1 on your steak you should get smacked by the Chef.. Because that would be an insult.

Awesome Vietnamese food! I never had Vietnamese food before. It was delicious! ! Great flavors and spectacular hospitality from the owner Richard. You have to try the Pho soup and Spring Rolls, Potstickers and Chicken sandwich. The Chicken sandwich was the bomb. It has marinated vinaigrette vegetables with chicken. The flavors of the chicken and vegetables are just so compatible with each other. There is a surprising crunch that will make your mouth water for more.
