Yummy! This place is wonderful, beside great decorations and a beautiful mural of AZ when you walk in, the food is great. They give you chips and 4 kinds of dip to start. I ordered a traditional green cheese enchilada! It was huge and came with b&r. This place is a jem ! Reasonably priced abs very clean and friendly.5 starts.

Had a great little lunch here today with a friend. Fast service and tasty blue cheese grilled cheese sandwich and salad. Our only complaint was that it was very crowded, poor atmosphere due to no decorations or style and the bathroom I'm extremely strong chemical smell from the spray they let people use it was hard to breathe and nauseating it was so strong. We didn't get around to having a dessert I've heard that they're amazing but we had a nice experience not one of my favorites but a good lunch place if you don't mind crowds.

I had mud all over my car and the guy gave me a dollar off for the $7 rim cleaning special, then they hand sprayed my tires before i went through the car wash and he even gave me a free rag to wipe my car down with. Then as I was drying my car they came around to ask everyone if the car wash turned out nice. They are very friendly and great team of guys.

I have been going to Dr. Cravatta for 6 plus years. I needed major dental /  periodontal work reconstruction done and I thank the Lord that we found him. He constructed an amazing k9 implant for me and also referred me to one of his colleagues Dr. Korey Blythe to do my veneers. Unfortunately in the past as young as 13 years old I've had a very poor experiences with many general dentist, orthodontist and even periodontist but Dr. Cravatta has exceeded all expectations and did a wonderful job and overall he is my friend! That is what's most important that you can trust someone to do a job with your best interest in mind.  I would refer Dr cravada to anyone who is in need of any kind of periodontal work he is the best.

I have always loved Zushi, they have very affordable menus all around specially the lunch menus. I got coconut shrimp with yummy ell rolls and this other dish that was not what I expected but i was pleasantly surprised. It's usually show here which is nice to come with my computer and use the WiFi. It's also very clean and the husband and wife that run it are great. I only wish they had more business for themselves.. This is a must go honestly I love it!!

I was so excited to try the pretzels that is why I came here. But boy oh boy, they are not fresh totally frozen from J&J pretzles and served with bad fake yellow cheese and I'm pissed! I don't like places that mislead you and this was a total fail, the Cesar salad was mean too bland and small as hell even for a side salad and the cheeses with the portable isn't beer cheese. The waitress was a doll that's all that was good

I found redemption through a friend and since then I am now a better person on the correct path and walk with God and I'm having fun at the same time. The pastor is amazing as well as all the people that attend. Honestly you should give any and all the redemption locations a chance they all have different vibes and fit a different demographic. All of life is all for Jesus.

Extremely disappointed for the third time. My friend and I went there because there was to be live music. The music was nice and so was the crowd. The restaurant was nice and clean and our waiter was very kind. The food on the other hand was terrible. We ordered pretzel bites for $9 they came out look like they were microwaved from frozen and the size of a quarter dark brown extremely chewy and with neon yellow cheese to dip in. I never sent things back to the kitchen but we told him we were not going to eat it so he took it away. On the other hand we ordered the fish and chips the fish was nice it was battered with a different concoction and the tartar sauce was different but nice as well. We were excited to try the hickima Apple coleslaw. Except when it came out it was traditional coleslaw and which had no flavor and was wilted, we didn't eat that either. Our waiter took off the cost of the pretzel bites and we simply told him they were not good. He was a nice guy but it is such a bummer because this restaurant has such potential I have been there 3 times in the last 2 years and everytime its bad food. I would not recommend this place. Unless you catered from another company and rented it out for the atmosphere. Also pier 52 which is next door has very poor food as well. Once again it's unfortunate cuz they are cool places.

They just opened so they are slowly adding more to the food and drink menus but, this place is so neat, it's modern/rustic decor and I love the walls they old wall paper simply painted as well as old brick showing thru. The old refurbished wood tables and trimmings add a ton of character too. The food is bomb, if you like smokehouse food this is one place you should check out. It picks up in the evening and weekend but for now they close at 8 so come for dinner or take out. Take out is less than 10 min and all smoke did is made fresh reach day! So come hungry Cuz anything you order is unique and amazing. Sauce is crazy tasty, the staff is fun and once again the food is so bomb!!!
