Went to ClimbMax yesterday with a friend. Walked in and no one was there besides the staff. We decided it was probably because we were there earlier in the afternoon and "Saturday business" hadn't picked up yet.   We go up to the counter, mind you there are two people there, and they do no acknowledge us at all. We said hello and were thrown clipboards with liability forms. No pens given. I just reached over and got them for myself and my friend.   After filling out the proper paperwork. The older man at the table asked us if we had climbed before. We both had, but not in a long time. We turn around to see two harnesses thrown on the floor for us to get into. We asked which way we get into them and he remarked, "I thought you climbed before". I said that I had, but in no way was an expert.   After loudly asking for help with getting the harnesses properly fitted. The young man came over and showed us how to properly use the equipment and climb. His name was Kevin, I think, and I would have rather just interacted with him. He was a lot more helpful, patient, and had the capability of smiling and had some good customer service skills.   I heard that this place has the best air conditioning and I believe it is because of the extremely cold reception that is received at the front desk. If I was that cold to people my AC bill would be nonexistent.   Eventually more people arrived which made the experience less uncomfortable and I was just glad that I was there with some good company.   My ranking goes.   1 star for Kevin. He helped out a lot.   1 star would have been for atmosphere, which was a bit chilly and weird that no one else was there for such a long time.   1 star would have been for basic common courtesy from all the staff. I felt like we were bugging the staff and inconveniencing them. Like I had accidentally walked into a funeral or something.   1 star would have been for equipment, which some seemed worn and needing some TLC. It is rock climbing so I don't like to feel like I am gambling with my life. Also the floor mats were lifting up and we kept tripping over them.   A 5 star experience would have been all of the above.  I wouldn't go here again and in fact, we later ran into someone who had a similar experience the same day. Word travels fast and I think that if they put a little more effort into their people skills that would improve their attendance and the ClimbMax gym. ClimbMax gym is ghost town filled with the ghosts of climbers past and will stay that way if their attitude stays the same.

Very friendly customer service. I was a walk in right after work because I have been stalling on getting my phone upgraded. The manager was very friendly and put me in the queue. I had to wait a little while but it was worth it because the gentleman who helped me gave me his full attention. Answered my questions. He didn't push any extra products, he just gave me options to help me keep my phone safe. (I'm clumsy).   The short wait was worth it because they aren't trying to rush you out to help the next person. They are making sure each person feels special. (Brandon was the guy who helped me). Very nice and knowledgable.   Besides. I don't mind the wait because I have a mini computer in my hands to play with.

Every time I remember to review this place, I can't take a picture because I have already eaten my ice cream.   It is awesome and delicious. The staff there is friendly and helpful, and I have yet to have a bad experience.   The manager is very involved and can usually be seen up front helping employees and cleaning the store.   Highly recommend. And I have yet to try a different ice cream because I am addicted to The Cinnamon Role Reaction.  I would show you a pic, but I ate my ice cream already. Totally worth the drive.

My family and I were visiting the Vegas area and wanted some delicious breakfast. This did not disappoint. The owner takes pride in his work and it shows through the fantastic food that he served. Everything was made to order and reasonably priced. I would definitely go there again.

OMG so fast. The gentleman at the front desk was super helpful and quick to fix the LCD and screen. Very polite. Very knowledgable. Would highly recommend going there.   PS. Be kind and if your phone is in pieces, make sure to separate them as best as possible. It makes their work a lot easier.

My sister and I went there post fireworks on the 4th of July. It is like the Tardis. It is totally bigger on the inside. At first you see the bar and think that is it, but then you turn the corner and see 2 N64 video game systems. Needless to say, my sister stayed here most of the evening.   Everyone was friendly and although the bartenders were extremely busy, I was able to get my drinks after my turn.   After the bar, past the N64's you turn left and it is more games, arcades, skeeball and music.   Even past that...you get seats for bottle service and another bar area. It was hard to find a good spot to dance, but the music was good, the people who work there were friendly and efficient and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it was hard to dance (but it may not be intended for that) and I didn't try the food, so it is not my place to rate the food.   Really nice surprise. Thanks for a great night!
