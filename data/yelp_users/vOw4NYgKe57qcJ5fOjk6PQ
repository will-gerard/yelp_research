This has to be the most we've ever paid for Thai that wasn't authentic, nor good.  As a San Diegan, I'm spoiled with all the Thai restaurants we have. It's easy to get great, hole-in-the-wall Thai food that tastes amazing. Although I looked at the Yelp page before visiting, I didn't think about the fact that maybe Arizona folks don't know what authentic Thai food tastes like. Besides the fact that much of the usual noodle and curry dishes are just scratching the surface, even these 'basic' dishes had the entirely wrong taste profiles and seemed prepped in the wrong way.   On that note - of prepping the food in the wrong way - we're pretty sure that the chicken in my dish and the beef in my boyfriend's dish were both cooked ahead of time and then overcooked with the ingredients of the dishes. The meat was bland. I bet if I were to peek into the kitchen, we'd see pre-cooked proteins sitting and waiting to be tossed into the noodle or curry dishes.  My boyfriend's pad see ew was kind of dry. It was a big portion, but just didn't pack the taste we're used to with pad see ew anywhere else. He asked for a 2, which out of a 5 should've been a little spicier than it was.   My pad Thai had chicken, shrimp, and tofu. The chicken was overcooked, though I liked the shrimp and the tofu. The taste was very off; I couldn't figure out what they must have put in the sauce to make it taste the way it did. It tasted closer to tomato sauce with fish sauce than anything else. I ventured the guess that maybe they're just using packets from a non-Asian store, and my boyfriend thought maybe I could be right.  However, I'm giving the place 2 stars because the service was good, the drink list was varied, and the atmosphere was nice. The gal at the front was nice and I could tell that the employees care about giving their customers a good experience. But it just wasn't authentic, and we were really bummed to pay $15 per dish - easily $4-6 more expensive per dish than a more authentic place - plus drinks for something that so badly missed the mark.

I sincerely love this place.  My friend Brian recommended we meet up here once when we were both in town. Needless to say, it was a great recommendation!  Although the location is unassuming and rather inconspicuous, don't let the strip mall scare you away. The wonderfully friendly staff and the wide variety of options will make everyone happy, even the vegetarians!  However, you shouldn't come here *just* for the vegetarian options (which I will try eventually, just to see how good they are). This place is excellent for spicy and sweet selections of beef, pork, and chicken, all of which you can sample before you dive in.  I highly recommend getting a combo. You can choose two items, preferred style of rice, and preferred style of beans. The items can either be presented alone or in a burrito or quesadilla. I usually get a quesadilla as one of my items, the pork fried rice, and black beans. It's hard to go wrong with the combo, seriously!  My favorite meat selections are the Chinese BBQ Pork and the machaca. Lately I've been trying other things, but nothing has let me down so far.   The free cookie is also a big bonus. Love their snickerdoodles! I'm not huge on cookies, but these ones are so soft and so delicious that they are entirely worth getting a half-dozen (or dozen!) to bring home.   I never seem to finish my combo, as good as it is. It can be a good light lunch for two or just make for excellent leftovers later.   Also: try going on the weekends sometime - they make different kinds of cookies and also offer a tostada on Sundays and Saturdays!  All in all, I really wish I had this place in San Diego. It'd be a hit, too. But I tend to visit every time I am in Arizona to see my parents, so perhaps that's what keeps it such a great place to return to again and again. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, no?

This is the most consistent place my parents like in Surprise. While it's no Old Town San Diego Mexican fare, I think it deserves four stars for a good menu, excellent lunch specials, spot-on service, and consistency.  I guess it's a chain; I haven't been to any of the other locations. It has a little bit of the feel of a chain, but not excessively. Their branding and marketing is pretty good and if I were in another town and came upon a Macayo's, I'd probably go.  My favorite dish is probably the chicken chimichanga. The burritos are good and I like the enchiladas a lot, too. The food is never dry and the sauces are all really good.  The portions are generous, mostly. I don't think I have ever been able to finish a meal there. They also load you up with a bunch of chips and salsa (like any good Mexican restaurant should). Mmmm-mmmm.  The one time I ordered a margarita, I wasn't terribly impressed. Maybe that was a fluke, but I know that at restaurants like Macayo's, it's usually just a marg mix.   We've never had a problem with service. It's always been prompt and they're quick to fill your water glasses and make sure you have enough chips and salsa. Everyone has been nice on every one of the visits I've been there. The service is the biggest reason I give Macayo's four stars.  I have only one small gripe: why is it an up-charge to get beans *and* rice with a dish? That's the nice thing about the lunch specials - often they come with beans and rice - but most dishes, aside from many of the lunch specials, have either rice or beans. C'mon: rice and beans belong together! Like ketchup and mustard. Salt and pepper. Bonnie and Clyde. Harry and Sally. You get my point.

I was fairly surprised to visit Line Thai and find some decently authentic, good-tasting Thai food. I'd always assumed that this area of Phoenix was (excuse me for the pun) totally dry on ethnic food, considering I had a hard time finding pho within a ten-mile radius of my parents' place in Surprise.  Anyways, I chose the pad si yew (spelling varies all over the place, I think they spell it "phat si iew") and my father ordered some kind of chicken cashew dish. Both were excellent, though a little more in the line of American tastes -- not as spicy, and the pad si yew wasn't cooked slightly burnt like I recall it traditionally is made -- it was pretty tasty.  The hot tea was a great companion to my meal as well.  The service was great without being too pushy, invasive, or sloppy. They always refilled my water in a timely manner and didn't interrupt my conversation with my dad. That's important to me -- that servers don't bust into your conversation with little to no consideration of personal space.  My parents had been there several times and enjoyed it, so now I see why they liked it. Oh, and their spring rolls and the accompanying peanut and hot sauces were also delicious -- not the best I've ever had but super-tasty.  The atmosphere is a little dry (what is it with this word? Sorry) but I can live with it. The booths were comfy and it's not like the place was musty or gross. Not every good restaurant needs to be chic and trendy, really.  All in all, it was a nice experience at a reasonable price and I'll definitely make a visit next time I hang out with the 'rents.

This place was pretty meh. We ordered online and tried to use a code they advertised on the site for 10% off, but it had expired late last year. Oh well, we were hungry, wanted to bring food home, and the menu looked good.  When we picked up our food, the staff was pleasant. At first I don't think the waitress understood that we were there to pick up food because she told us several times to sit where we wish. We were worried for a second that we had just paid online and they hadn't made food, but they did have the order. I told them about the 10% coupon mishap and she said they would fix it on the site (I actually kind of expected a more generous response because that's really just false advertising, so at that point my review depended upon how good the food turned out).   We each ordered pita sandwiches. I ordered a honey chicken pita sandwich and my parents ordered gyro sandwiches. The gyro sandwiches were good, but the honey chicken gyro was not quite what I had expected. For $6 I have had much worse, though.  The site made no mention of fries as a side. Huge, steak-cut fries. They were soggy. I would've gladly gotten some other side dish had I known.  We really just dismissed the site as being crappy for most of the miscommunication, but really, I didn't like my honey chicken gyro. The site told us that pickup was at noon, but since the fries were soggy and the cheese on my gyro had that weird consistency (as if it had been microwaved or something), I figured the food sat around for a while.  If you're going to have online ordering, do it right. If you're going to offer discounts, do it right. If you're going to do fries, do it right. This place really didn't do any of it right. We shrugged it off and decided that next time we'll just go to Greek Corner.

I came here once at least a year ago with my parents and we honestly weren't terribly impressed. I found some of the sushi to be all right - the eel was rather good - but the rolls were small and the sashimi was unimpressive. Being a big sushi fan, I thought it was pretty good for the desert - hey, I'm biased, I live in California - and brushed off the high prices and mediocre quality as a result of the lack of competition in the area.  Fast-forward to today: obviously I'd forgotten about the place and bought the Yelp deal thinking my dad and I were going to check it out for the first time for lunch. Wrong; we pulled up to the restaurant and my dad reminded me that this was the sole sushi place we'd been to in town. No worries, we decided, we'll eat there for lunch anyways since the lunch bowls looked really good and the Yelp deal was enticing.  We were invited to seat ourselves. When the server brought us the menus, I informed her that I had a Yelp deal. She promptly removed the lunch menus from the table and told me that lunch specials weren't eligible with coupons. All right, I said politely, and my father and I proceeded to look at the menu. "You sure you don't want to leave?" my dad asked. I said no and decided that I'd just discuss the fact that the Yelp deal doesn't mention any restrictions thus she should honor the deal. In fact, the voucher specifically states, "Deal must be honored according to terms on voucher. No additional restrictions may be added at time of redemption."  Well, the server came back to the table to take our order and I immediately mentioned that the Yelp deal does not mention any restrictions. She reiterated that they don't allow ordering lunch specials with a coupon. At this point it became an argument; I again tried to tell her that the Yelp deal doesn't list restrictions and that she is supposed to honor the deal as provided. She didn't let me finish my sentence and hurried back to grab the lunch menus, hastily and rudely shoving the lunch menus back onto the table and walking away.   My dad and I looked at each other in disbelief. He suggested we leave and eat lunch at Macayo's, the popular local chain of Mexican restaurants. Done deal, I said, and we walked out.  Hopefully I'll be able to get my Yelp deal refunded. There is no way I am ever going back. It was mediocre sushi in the first place; if it makes me a snobby Californian for bashing the place then so be it, because all of these reviews of "great sushi" are total B.S. and I'm guessing a lot the reviewers haven't eaten the good stuff (I myself had never had truly decent sushi until I moved to California). Besides, it wasn't even the quality that drove me away, it was the horrendous attitude this woman gave us. A place like this doesn't deserve to be in business.

Any review using the phrases "the meat is always tender" and "peanut sauce" is sure to be a four-star review or higher, right? Well this one is.  My parents love taking out-of-town guests here and we have not yet heard a complaint from any of our visitors. The food has been pretty good so far, but I have avoided ordering the pho as what tastes I've had from my mother's orders didn't seem to be up to par with what I'm used to (and spoiled by) in San Diego. Well, it's not San Diego, but for a Phoenix suburb, it's still pretty good food.  In terms of wait service, I find it pretty baffling what poor service others have reported. We have generally had pretty great service at Saigon Kitchen, particularly from Hue, but once in a while some of their servers seem a little disorganized and distracted. During my last visit, I requested extra peanut sauce (even though it doesn't usually go with the dish I ordered), and the waiter told me "No, this is the sauce," and pointed at the nuoc cham (dipping sauce). I told him that I understood but that I wanted extra peanut sauce. Finally another waitress with a little more sense told me that she could go get it, but I was just too annoyed by the other server who kept refusing a reasonable request - something my dad asks for and had just gotten a moment earlier, actually - that I told her I'd be fine. (And yes. I'm also childishly laughing every time I say peanut sauce. There! Did it again...)  Other than a few minor miscues, I really enjoy lunch here. The meat is always tender and all the ingredients seem fresh. I like the shrimp rolls quite a lot. On my last visit, I ordered Vietnamese iced coffee, and at first was disappointed because it seemed kind of small; after trying it I realized that it was just too rich to be served any bigger. I'd order it again though.  My favorite thing is the combo bun. Shrimp, pork, and egg rolls - can't go wrong with this one. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the serving size was ample.  One day I will have to order the pho, but again I don't think it will measure up to the hole-in-the-wall places in San Diego, and that's okay. I'll still come here with my parents and enjoy other dishes.  And the peanut sauce.

Why are there so many good reviews of this place?   Jim's Burgers and Eggs is just around the corner from where my parents live and my dad had been curious about this place for a while. We decided to try this place for something different for lunch and came in around 11 o'clock. It looked promising because there were quite a lot of people there, but we soon found out that it was lacking in a lot of areas.  First off, as we were ordering, the woman at the counter (the owner?) was arguing with her staff over an order. She was berating the poor girl and other staff members - mentioning quite loudly about how another waitress almost dropped a dish. It was unprofessional and delayed the time it took for our order to get to the cooks and furthermore delayed other patrons from ordering. But that was just the beginning.  My father and I sat down and I noticed that the tables weren't really clean. There were dishes from patrons who had left (and kindly left tips with their meals) that sat there until we left. There were a lot of people who seemed to be waiting on their orders as opposed to a lot of people enjoying the food.  We saw multiple patrons receive drinks before us although they had ordered after us. Why the staff at the front doesn't just serve the drinks right after ordering, I don't know; that's how most restaurants set up this way (order at the front, get a number) handle it. We saw the young waitresses make several trips doling out orders to a single table - I'm not sure why they don't make use of serving trays and silverware in their aprons, but it would improve the service by leaps and bounds. So would getting a decent POS system since it was apparent that their hand-written tickets were slowing down service.  The wait service was so awful that I started to feel bad for those girls. It's like somebody didn't teach them how to effectively wait tables. Between that and being berated by the owner, I'm not sure how any of those girls could handle sticking around.  Oh, and the food? What we ordered - the $6.25 burger special and a Hawaiian burger - wasn't very good. It's supposed to be a burger joint, yet the patties seemed to be of the lowest grade with lettuce that wasn't very fresh and buns that were substandard. The price is no excuse for the bad quality; In-N-Out uses much better buns and patties and the cost is dramatically lower, although I understand that this isn't a franchise or chain.   The whole time I couldn't help but think that this place could really use a visit from one of those restaurant consultants on television to teach them 1) how not to deal with employee issues in front of customers, 2) teach their staff how to wait tables, and 3) pick up the quality of food a bit. I can't really say I'm all that motivated to go back, though I'm curious about their breakfast items and might be tempted to try them sometime.

Athena is wonderful! She definitely lived up to her reviews.   I was looking for a good quick, affordable haircut.  I typically get my hair cut by a friend back home, but I couldn't wait to get back home, so I rang her up to see if she had time for me. She was waiting on a customer who turned out to show up a little late - though she said she'd call me and I could come in if the customer didn't show - so I ended up arranging for an appointment the next day. I was really impressed with how she followed up (why don't people follow up this well? Obviously it gets business) and was very encouraged by such great communication.  She's very genuinely nice and will gladly give you tips on how to take care of your hair. I have particularly difficult hair to care for and she did a wonderful job cutting my hair and styling it. Her prices are definitely reasonable! I will be coming back and sending my mom here, too!

It's great to see a Filipino place in Arizona! I would never have imagined! Well, I mean, before my mother joined the nursing staff at a local hospital, I didn't know there were other Filipinos in suburban Phoenix. Anyways...  I really dig this lil place. I've only had one boba drink - a taro blended drink that was super-sweet - and it wasn't anything to write home about. That said, it's still pretty good for not being California.  But boba isn't what I really like about the place. Pinoy's Best has a really nice staff, a great selection of Goldilocks Filipino foods (like siopao!), and I even found polvoron there! It was a couple bucks for a warm siopao and you can get frozen siopao to take home for even less per unit. They even have longanisa. When I'm hanging out at my parents', it's always on my mind to drop by and grab a little treat to take home.  The service can be a little hit-or-miss, but everybody is really nice despite it sometimes being slow. It is pretty popular; I've always seen a bunch of people in the place at once.  The ownership is super nice and it seems like a lot of people like to stop in, say hello, and express their gratitude. I like that.  I look forward to every visit and I can't wait to come back.

I think we've finally found an ice cream joint that my dad really likes here in lil ol Surprise.  Okay, I know: it's not really ice cream. It's ice custard. And there's a whole bunch of other cool stuff - like gelatis and milkshakes and mistos and blendinis - that I can't wait to try on another visit.  I'd never heard of Rita's, but I guess it's a chain. And it's not too bad of a chain from what I can tell. This particular location is really clean.  My mother ordered a banana split Italian ice and my dad and I ordered ice custard sundaes. I was impressed at how rich the ice custard is. They had a good variety of toppings - I picked caramel and Reese's Pieces, which turned out to be pretty sweet, but made for a good leftover treat - and there were a lot of different Italian ice flavors. I'll have to go for the Italian ice next time as even a regular-sized ice custard is quite a lot to consume.   That said, the portions are generous and you will definitely leave satisfied. The staff was pretty nice but had to request things a few times to get the right to-go cups or flavors. They seemed to know the product really well, though, and I wouldn't say the service was bad.  Glad to have finally found an ice cream place my dad enjoys. He's not terribly fond of frozen yogurt (though we won't complain about it), so I can see us all coming back a few more times to get some respite from the Arizona heat.

Whoa - I'm impressed!  Perhaps it's a mistake on my behalf, but I did not anticipate finding a decent Asian grocery in Glendale. It's no secret that many Asians are moving into the Phoenix area, particularly to escape the high costs in California, but I'm really not used to anything being comparable to California when it comes to Asian anything. Haven't really found good pho, haven't even tried to find ramen, etc. etc.... but this store is excellent.  Anyhow, I was definitely impressed. There were things that I have trouble finding in San Diego on a regular basis that were easily found and in abundance in this store, and all my favorite Filipino brands were there. I went home with pork longganisa, pork siopao, and some Jufran... it was heavenly!  There's also a pretty decent fish selection and we took home some octopus for appetizers. Delicious. I can't wait to get some bangus on my next visit.  I can't say that it's the most comprehensive Asian grocer around - I haven't had the time to look at all of it, and I doubt I ever will! - but I'll be back when I visit my parents and need the proper ingredients for a good Asian meal.  Also: the service was pretty good, and fellow patrons were friendly! Always a bonus!

It's really nice to have an authentic Filipino restaurant out here in the Phoenix suburbs! My mother is from the Philippines and I have grown up around authentic Filipino food (and can make some of it myself), so I can tell you that this place is straight-up The Real Deal.  When I first heard from the owners of Pinoy's Best that there would be a Filipino restaurant in Surprise, I knew to keep my eye out for when it would become a reality. Now it's here and it's very delicious. Or, in Tagalog, "masarap-sarap!"  My mother and I visited for lunch and were immediately impressed by the rather extensive menu. Some items aren't available every day, but it's still a really impressive selection. We ordered adobo pusit, pork menudo, and pancit canton. My mom hadn't eaten Adobo Pusit in quite a while - squid in vinegar and soy marinade - and she was really excited to taste it. It didn't disappoint.  The pork menudo was also delicious. They even included liver in the dish, which to me screams authentic; I always feel like there's a fight over the liver pieces between my Filipino uncles once the pickings get a little slim. The carrots and potatoes were perfectly cooked and the sauce was rich and satisfying.  Although the pancit was good, it was a little salty for my taste. If anything, my only (small!) complaint is that the food was rather salty - but if you've ever eaten authentic Filipino food, you'll know that a lot of the food is very salty and sometimes there's just no getting around that. While nothing beats my Auntie Rose's amazing pancit, I still liked the pancit here.  As we finished our meal, we decided to take home a little bit of food for dinner. We ordered lechon kawali. We discovered when we got home that the portion wasn't very big and that they forgot to include rice, so that was a tad disappointing - but nothing that would keep us from ordering it again.  We also took home a little bit of puto (now, don't get this confused with Spanish - in Filipino, puto is a muffin-shaped steamed bread made with rice flower). There was a little bit of cheese on top of it. It was a perfect treat!  Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Pinoy's Bistro. The service was very good and the atmosphere just right for a lunch spot. The prices were fair and the portions were generally very good (especially the pancit).   One cool thing about paying at Pinoy's: they use Square to accept payments. Square is reaching a higher adoption rate every day, from what I can tell, after taking off with tech-savvy cafes and restaurants mostly in large metro areas. When you use cards that are tied to your account in Square, you can get a receipt e-mailed or texted to you, plus at Pinoy's they keep track of your visits and you get a stamp on your virtual loyalty card for every visit! We have yet to see what the loyalty card reward is, but I'm sure we'll find out soon as we plan on going back before too long.  Like I said, we'll be back. I'm very excited for our next visit!

This was my favorite meal during my trip to Scottsdale and I will be going out of my way to go back again.  Like other reviewers have noted, I know that this place doesn't serve authentic Mexican food. But I don't care. The flavors are extremely well chosen and make for really tasty dishes where there's something for everyone. We did mostly tacos when we ate here and experienced a good variety of flavors that really made me wish we could have a Diego Pops here in San Diego. (Please? I mean, we're San DIEGO. We need a DIEGO Pops. Clearly!)  My absolutely favorite thing on the menu was the Street Corn Queso. Goodness, this stuff is like crack! I wanted more! However I'd ordered three tacos - which should be enough for most anyone - and those were fantastic, too. It seems that the wait staff is pretty good at giving their honest opinions on food and drink - our server had some great recommendations and I'm glad I took them - so don't be too quick to go all willy-nilly with your order. Listen to the wait staff and they'll guide you well.  The drinks were strong and tasty. I drank sangria and my boyfriend had a Mexican Mule and a Prickly Pear Margarita. I tried both and they were delicious.   The only thing I could possibly gripe about was that we ordered a little more towards the end of our meal and it took a little while than we would've liked. No sweat, it happens. It didn't ruin the experience.  I'll be dreaming about that Street Corn Queso and trying to make my own. Or I'll be finding a way to go back to Scottsdale for another visit. I must, must, must return.
