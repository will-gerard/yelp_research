I love this fancier, casual restaurant in downtown Gilbert.  Great food, great service, great ambiance.

I wasn't looking for any gifts, but I tried the date shake somewhat hesitantly, but it was so good.  I will go back for another.

I think the line from where you order all the way to the door speaks for itself.  Really yummy bbq and homemade root beer.

These were delicious cupcakes.  My fav was pumpkin, which I'm sure is a seasonal flavor, but I would eat it year round.  Yum.  A bit pricey, but beautiful presentation and delicious.

We went to Red Tomato for the first time this evening.  I was attracted to it by its "curb appeal" and found a voucher on restaurant.com and decided to check it out.  We went at about 5:30 pm on Thurs night and there was hardly anyone else there.  We ordered the personal size pizza "Not so Guilty" was the name of the pizza.  It was excellent.  We also ordered the wings which actually came after the pizza, but that's ok.  They were not that good.  They were dry and didn't have much sauce on them.  They also served them with ranch dressing instead of blue cheese.  That was not cool.  The restaurant has just the right mix of bar and restaurant feel.  Nice decorating and good view of the tv screens showing the football game.   They had cool dough that they let the kids play with before the meal.  Not sure what it was, but I know I would want to play with it if I were a kid.

I'm pretty sure this is the best pizza I have ever had.  We split the bruschetta plank which was good, nothing spectacular and the garlic pizza.  The crust was cooked perfectly thin and had delicious flavor.  The ambiance was very nice as well.

Ate here after reading about the burgers on pretzel buns.  It was every bit as delicious as I imagined.  I was disappointed when I read that on Fridays, burgers are half off, but when I asked the server she stated that that was only after 4pm.  I wished they had advertised that little bit of info too.  The crispy fries were delish as well.  Loved that pretzel bun.  Will go back for that for sure.

It didn't bother me a lot at first, but the more I think about it, the more unsatisfied I am with our experience here.  We went with a group of about 10 or so people.  It was pretty empty in there, so it wasn't very loud, which was nice.  It was so dark, we had to use our cell phones to see the menu.  No biggie.  There was a large menu with a good variety of eats.  We went with the nachos which were pretty good, although, I don't think pulled pork really goes with nachos.  Anyway, the website advertised $1 draft beer and $1 SoCo Limes.  When we got there around 7:15, we learned that the "$1 beers" didn't start until 8, so the ones that couldn't wait ordered the $7 Mason jar beers.  At 8, we ordered the $1 beers (Bud Light, Miller Light and Coors Lite only) and got one or maybe 2 rounds for some of those.  The server then told us that there was no longer $1 drafts, but $3 Mason jars.  She also said that there were not $1 SoCo Limes.  After a little convincing, she did give us one round of $1 Soco Limes served in big plastic cups.  After asking, they did start the mechanical bull for a few guys in our group.  He was cool and even let them each go twice.  At the end, she did not know what anyone had ordered, so we had to try to remember everything we ate and drank.  Seemed kind of disorganized.

We went here attracted to the grand opening banner that advertised $1 hot dogs and $2 burgers.  That sounded yummy, so we decided to check it out.  Pulling up I noticed they advertised real charcoal grilling and sure enough they cook everything to order on a charcoal grill behind the counter.   We were not asked how we wanted the items cooked, but the man cooking the food had been interacting with us, so I asked him to make my two hot dogs well done and he made the perfectly.  The toppings for the hot dogs and burgers looked fresh.  We ordered the macaroni and cheese which was also delicious.  I really wasn't expecting much other than a plain ole' hot dog, but it was really, really good.  We enjoyed the TV's that were playing, they are excellent quality and the world cup was on.

It is hard  to not give a good review for cookies and ice cream.  I had a snickerdoodle cookie, a mint chip cookie with chocolate cookie dough ice cream in the center.  Delicious.  The best part is, it is only $2!  It's a generous scoop of ice cream too.  I will be back.
