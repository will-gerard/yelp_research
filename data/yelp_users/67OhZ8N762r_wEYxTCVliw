The worst place I have ever been. The service was horrible and the food was even worse. If u are someone who values customer service this isnt the place for you.

I would prefer to not even give them a star my experience was so bad. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE out there, but worse than that they overbilled my insurance, got my prescription wrong two times, and took 6 months to order contacts for me. Worst experience with eye doctors. The doctor is very old fashioned and his equipment is as well. I had to contact my insurance several times because of their bills to my insurance company. I had an appointment in December for just an exam and they billed my insurance for that year for contacts that I never purchased. The proceeded to bill my insurance after that for each time I had to come back to the doctors upon the doctors inability to get my prescription right the first time. the front desk is terrible. Angie doesn't know how to use a computer and writes all the appointments/prescriptions by hand and someone else enters the information in later.   Explains why several of my appointments were overlooked and had to be rebooked. Audra the office manager will never return a phone call and gives you false information regarding prices and insurance. If you are going to go here, you want to make sure that you are prepared to deal with a poor staff, a lazy outdated doctor, and expect a mess with your insurance.   BOTTOM LINE DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Loved my dogs groom here. They did such a good job on her and put an adorable bandana on her after. Groom was excellent and this will be where I take her in the future for that.   I have done a couple daycares and my dog seems to enjoy it. I don't love that the outside area is rock and that is my biggest complaint about the place but I still like it here. I like that they are in small groups indoors but I wish they had a little more space indoors. I almost feel like they are crated, even tho they have someone to play with.   The staff is super friendly and I really like the owner. I think overall this is a great place to take your dog, clean, friendly, and safe which is most important. There are some areas that I think could improve, but overall I'm very happy with this place so far. I've struggled finding good dog daycares.

Scott has been amazing over the past few months! Everyone is friendly and super flexible and great to work with. Scott is awesome with nutrition and making sure it's reasons with your lifestyle. Thanks to Scott I don't go to the gym and only do cardio and machines. Any goal you have, he can help you get there

I'm very disappointed in my dogs latest stay here. I just realized that they had a video cam to check up on your dog, the place was way overcrowded for the space they give them to play. It's incredibly small. I paid for all day play and out of 4 days I only saw my dog on. Camera two times (morning only) the first time she was even with the small dogs and she's not a small dog. The third day I found her with her size dogs but again only in the morning.   The workers do not play with the dogs. The play time is just being out with other dogs, no toys or anything just a very small space on tile like flooring. Not enough space for play time for most dogs. Very disappointed.  The groupons do not cover playtime and they charge you for anything extra and I'm not even sure I got all day play for my dog considering she was never on camera...suspicious. I don't recommend this place. This is my third time there but the first time that I looked at the camera and checked on my dog and I don't think they are honest in how they take care of your pet. Will not be returning.

Do not go here! I have had now two really bad instances. My wallet was stolen by one of workers and my other instance they broke my center console in my car. Terrible place. Bad salespeople that won't take no for an answer, managing is insulting and cashier is very unpleasant.

At first I wasn't sure about this place. I didn't know if I liked the idea of my dog being out all day and night with other dogs. I have a very high energy dog and nothing makes her tired. I decided to give this place a go because of the convenience of location and drop off/pickoff times. My dog came home Sunday completely exhausted! She never is like that and she curled up and slept with me for three hours straight and then got her crate and slept the rest of the night. I would have to say that she must have had fun and was busy playing all weekend. They have her a bath before she got home and I was really appreciative of that.   I'm not 100% sold on the cleanliness of the place, because I didn't see all the facility. But I have no definite complaints about it. I think they overall did a good job. I will try this out again sometime and see how she does. I've struggled finding a good day care and I'm very picky about it. I just want to make sure she's safe here with he amount of dogs and them all being out all the time. But she seemed to be fine and love it. So I will take her back for another go:).
