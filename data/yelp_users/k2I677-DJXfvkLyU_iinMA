The food is very good , but the service stinks. There have been times when I can't get through on the phone for an hour. Tonight really was the icing on the cake. I ordered a pizza at 545 and was told it would take "over an hour". Now when I think over an hour I'm thinking an hour and a half or so.  An hour and 45 minutes rolls around and I called and the only explanation I got was that they were busy. Totally cool, I've been in the service industry I get that things don't always go as planned. It has now been 2 hours and 15 minutes and I still don't have a pizza. Not too happy and pretty hungry... Oh and even better just got the pizza , it was not even close to warm so I threw it away and ordered a new one from Rosatis. I did appreciate them crediting my card back. Never again though ..

Great pizza and great customer service . Last night I had a terrible experience with another local place - it took over 2 hours to get a cold pizza. So I decided to throw that pizza in the garbage and order Rosati's. They showed up before their quoted time, brought a hot pizza and were very polite on the phone. Definitely refreshing !

I'm a huge fan of Nypd. Their pizza is really, but I would definitely ask for it well done so the crust comes a little crispy. Their delivery times are spot on. They save your information and know your past orders so it makes for a pretty easy ordering process.   I'm a pretty decent tipper for a good delivery guy and I really like the guy with the mustache. He's very nice and even brought us a little card for a complimentary appetizer last night as a thank you.   I highly recommend nypd for their food, but the customer service is what pushes them from a four to a five star  review for me.

I tried Village Tavern for the first time  last week. We were promptly and politely greeted when entering .  Our waitress was very nice and offered up suggestions since it was our first time . She also was very attentive with our drinks.  The nachos were good . A lot of food though and our waitress warned us of that. Our entrees were really great as well.   The environment was nice and quiet . The building itself pretty cool too because it has the wood beams showing on the ceiling . I would definitely go back here.

One star for nice property, one star for having tennis courts . Now to explain why I took away three stars.  The HOA is an absolute joke. The letters they send don't even make sense sometimes and are sloppy. If you're going to have a no dog over 40 lbs limit then enforce it for everyone not just people who the old bitchy lady with the rat dog complains about even though our dogs were minding their own business. Plus one of our dogs is 45 lbs can she really eye out 5 lbs over the limit ?  Somehow I highly doubt it.   Oh and speaking of dogs , you probably don't want yours to be here because there are tons of people who let their dogs run around off the leash. Extremely unsafe , let's hope that no children are walking around . Oh yes and the nice tennis court ? Well people let their dogs play in there like it's a dog park. Hey guys, news flash. Chaparral dog park is like 2 miles away MAYBE. How can an HOA enforce a dog being 5 lbs over the limit then tell us if we cut his food down he will be sure to make the limit then not do anything about these other people.   Also don't wear flip flops outside because they water the sidewalk all day and you will slip- trust me , I've done it.   They should just make this property into an over 55 community because if you're young they target you. We aren't some young college kids that are loud we're a married couple. They really need to get over themselves here because it isn't THAT nice .

They are so nice here! After a not so enjoyable experience at David's bridal, I came here looking for shoes. It took me forever to find the right shoes to go with my wedding gown so I was a little behind. I needed the shoes for my fitting two days later. The girl who helped us out let me borrow a pair of shoes for my fitting while I waited for the new pair to come in!!  I would recommended this place highly as they are down to earth, offer up suggestions, and very helpful.

In September , I bought my dress here. It was really reasonable and the atmosphere was very relaxing. I didn't feel pressured and none of the dresses picked out were above my budget.  A couple weeks ago I went back to get my first fitting. The seamstress was very sweet and kept me informed on all the changes we would be making .  I love my dress and couldn't be happier with my two different experiences at Almond Tree. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a beautiful wedding dress.

Very good food and service every time I've been.  Tonight really blew me away. My in laws had  never been and our waiter really explained the menu in depth . The food is consistently delicious. I love the capriossa (sp?). I didn't care for the drink I ordered so the waiter was nice enough to replace it with something that fit my taste better.  I never had an empty glass or dirty plate in front of me. Every time we go here , we have an awesome experience . For me, the pizza here is much better than Bianco .
