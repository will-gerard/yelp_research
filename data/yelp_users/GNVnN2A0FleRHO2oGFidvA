Remember to suck in your gut when entering and exiting this place. It doesn't bode the largest establishment around, and if you show up at the wrong time you might be sitting outside in the sun in anticipation.   I have been to this place several times and have not been disappointed once. I would suggest something for you to try, but I can't decide on any specific thing that is better than the other. The cup of sweet toast is a must try. My face literally melted off in delight. The burgers and fresh-cut fries are in my personal epic category. The egg sandwich is ridiculous. Really the only knock to this place is it's size. If I didn't need a crowbar to get myself out of the building each time I go, then it might be better.   Seriously people, go here. Eat here. Revel in your trip to the land of gluttony. I love this little cramped trailer and it's treasure trove of goodness.

I lived in this apartment complex for the past year. It comes with all of the bells an whistles. This behemoth overshadows the sketchy neighborhood it resides in. Don't get me wrong, I never felt endangered, but you place an expensive jewel in the middle of dirt and it will get dirty.  Facility-wise this place is enviable. Huge pool with sandy beach. Large pool/grilling facilities. Volleyball court. Nice, cozy gym.   The apartment is ok by my standards. It is basic and ok for the price I suppose. 745 sq. ft. for $800 a month. I was never a fan of my neighbors, and this is where the dirt from the outside starts to seep in. No one was ever friendly towards me. I had loud, obnoxious residents around me. It was, at some points, insufferable.   I even had an instance this past spring when the trees and flowers blossomed and grew. They grew right over my stairwell. When I asked if they could send someone to trim it back, they acted like they put it down. It took 3 weeks before anything happened. That is just terrible service.   Granted it is not all bad. I wouldn't exactly recommend it, but I am picky. So now you know.

Alright. I suppose my input is needed. I have to say that I am a fan of this place. Everytime I have gone there, they have cut my hair better than I expected. Being elitist, I am picky about who cuts my hair and what it ultimately looks like. Therefore, you will not happen upon me with a $10 haircut.  As stated in the previous reviews, they will get you a beer, glass of wine or water to wet your palate as they work their magic. All of them are friendly and willing to help. I enjoy being able to ask what would be cool and allowing them to adorn my head as such. The atmosphere is set as you climb the stairs. Walls draped with curtains, guitars and mirrors. What is not to like? To avoid any confusion, it is not as expensive as one would think. For the dudes, the cuts run around $30. Can't go wrong with that price. After all, you deserve to look like you might actually be important.

I struggle with the quantity of stars to bestow on this place. Maybe 2.5?  I totally get that this is a dive bar. It is understandable that dive bars are suppose to leave residue on you when you leave. However, they shouldn't leave the lasting impression of scariness that this place does.   I was greeted completely without any admirable candor (not that I should expect it). "What do you want?" doesn't exactly ring in my ears as an invitation of welcome. I guess I also picked this place when apparently no one comes in. There was one other dude there. He looked like Santa Claus' illegitimate child. So, I would hope a hipper crowd parades around when Trunkspace is rocking.   I suppose my biggest complaints are the lack of welcome that the whole place vibed to me; the inability to judge based on clientele (given what was there, I would guess a village of elves); and the lack of any clean surface in the place. Perhaps I am hasty to judge, but I will sit on my 2.5 until a better experience can raise that. I will presumably be drunk for that to happen.

This place knows how to rock my face off. Maybe I am just easy in giving them 5 stars, but they impressed when I didn't know what to expect. The brushetta is off the chain. I tried several different slices of pizza and not one disappointed.   The only knock I can give is that, given that it is a small place, it does take a long time to get seated if there is a crowd. They do say patience is a virtue. Believe me this place is worth the wait. By far my favorite pizza place thus far. I am eagerly anticipating my next travel there. Not soon enough...

I am being generous with my review. I am biased since this place has been one of my favorite restaurants for years. I love it in Georgia and this place continues the tradition of rocking faces off - Italian style.   I went to this locale for my birthday party with about 20 friends (unbelievable, I know). This place was more than accommodating. The waitress was fantastic, even though we were a pain in the butt come check time. I took her suggestions for our family style dinner and not one disappointed. I highly recommend the Rigatoni D and Chicken Prosciutto. Both were fantastic entrees. To top it off, we finished out with killer tiramisu.   There is nothing bad I can say for this place. The atmosphere is what you would  expect from a large italian restaurant. I personally love that their waiting area is also the bar. That is just good thinking. It truly is a killer place that is perfectly nestled in north Scottsdale. I am in love...

A-MMM-A-A-A-ZING!!! Seriously folks, this place makes some freaking awesome food and margaritas. I literally feel like bursting into song when I get to eat here (and after a few margs, I do).  The only knock that could possibly be given to this place is it's service. It is hit-and-miss. But seriously folks, what do you expect in a college town?  My suggestions are going during happy hour for a homemade margarita at a killer deal. Also, for eats, you can't go wrong with the Steak Ranchero or the Mole Chicken. Both make me salivate just to type their names.  Fortunately if you are starving, it helps that their salsa is righteously good. So, go there soon or run the risk of me beating you there and eating yours too.

Yikes. I have been waiting on submitting this review since I just could not find the right words for this place. Like Si said earlier, this is not my typical scene. I am uncomfortable in bars. Generally, I am crying into my heinously over-priced, poorly mixed drink in the corner. But that is not relevant to this review at all. Pfff.  I am not cool enough to understand why people like this place or why it is cool. This has to be one of the smallest dance clubs ever constructed. Are these cramped quarters good,  so that someone is guaranteed to unknowingly grab your ass at some point in the evening? Also, the layout for the place, with two different mixes of house music permeating both floors, is obnoxious. It truly feels like the cool peeps are dry humping each other upstairs, and the not-so-great peeps are downstairs wishing they were upstairs.   The cover was $7. WTF? I can think of millions of different things I could spend my cash on. But don't relax just yet, we haven't even explored the deplorable cost of drinks. This must be the place that Paul Rudd was referring to in 40 Year Old Virgin, when he states "Yeah, it is $9 beer night." $7 for a gin and tonic, that freaking Cocktail served us. I loved the fact that because I wasn't dancing vigorously or did not have huge, fake breasts, that it took him like 12 minutes to figure out we were there.   This place is horrible. The icing is the fact that these huge bouncers plop themselves triumphantly in every corner, just waiting for the chance to push scrawny punks out of the way.   All I can say is this is not my kind of place and I am totally ok with that.

Wow, there is not a lot of love for this place. I suppose that is fitting.   I have only been here for reverse happy hour. This is primarily because it is too freaking expensive for what you get. Sapporo right down the street has much better sushi at the same price.   There are good things. The reverse happy hour makes it affordable, for us whose pockets aren't loaded with coin. The sushi is decent.   One of the big faux pas of this place, I think,  is the atmosphere. Plastering the walls with huge flat panels that are flickering the latest sports event, seems to scream chicken wings and beer to me, not sushi and sake. Overall, this is not a coveted destination, but works if you are dying for mediocre sushi at Robin Leach prices. Wow.

Wow, only 3 stars? I have to drop a big fiver on this place. This place rocked my socks right off. For realzies peeps.  Initially, this place looks like a run down Taco Bell (surprise, surprise), but once inside it totally works. Unfortunately, it does maintain the same constraints of an old Run-to-the-Border place. This does make for long waits, but I tell you chillins that it is totes worth it. This is one of those places where the food is worth the wait.   For the sake of nostalgia and the added weight of a yelp review, I ordered the chicken and waffles. I was not disappointed. The chicken was juicy and well cooked throughout, with a savory seasoned breading corralling all the flavor. The waffles were light and fluffy. You could tell it was all home made. The only knock was the homemade gravy wasn't my can of beans, but I can't be a hater if you liked it. All of this was topped off with fresh squeezed OJ.   So peeps, I confirm the tastiness that is Over Easy. Enjoy. There is a reason to wake up early on Saturday....but not too early.

Bomb sauce. I have been anticipating this place since I was told they serve chicken and waffles. But don't go here expecting soul food like Mama used to make. This place is modern and cool. You won't have grease stains on a paper plate. Rather you will have a delectable meal that is finger-lickin' good.  I read a lot of reviews of this place before I darkened their doorway. So, kudos to you previous reviewers for suggesting the mac and cheese. That was bomb. Then I ordered the chicken and waffles. I was instantaneously in heaven. The only knock to the whole meal was the braised greens. I have had better, but that doesn't lower my score because they are inferior anyway to the brilliance that sat on the plate beside them.   Also, the wait staff was extremely helpful and patient. Since we sat at the bar near the kitchen, they let us see everything as it come out and were more than happy to tell us what each dish was.   The decor is very modern and appealing. They have gone to great lengths to make sure you know that this place is hip and with it.   I can't say much more other than, you must try this place. You must quit what you are doing right now and go. Drop the pen. Step away from the keyboard. Get up. Put on pants. Go eat at Tuck Shop. Wow- as I wrote that I realized that is a good schedule for my day...

Not that I can add anything more to what has already been said, but this place rocks. High caliber people running the show and working there. Always great stuff coming from the kitchen and the coffee pots. I have never had anything bad here. It is added bonus that these people are the bright spot in a City North that desperately needed something good to overshadow the lame (especially across the street).   Their special events are a must. I must note that I have never been to an event there, but given that everything these peeps touch glosses over with gold,  I believe my fellow yelpers are raving about. Kudos to you Press. I love you.

I will put this review simply. I lie awake some nights still craving another encounter with a Lola Coffee muffin. From the moment I bit into it's soft, billowy interior, time slowed down. It was reminiscent of the cartoon love scenes. Butterflies, train whistles and the ability to float of the ground were all happening.   As far as the coffee goes, it was a hit with me. I not a super picky coffee drinker. Perhaps considered by some a lightweight given that my drink of choice is a white chocolate mocha. I've heard those are hard to mess up.   This is less of a review and more of a love profession of the delectables that reside on the counter of Lola. I will return my sweets...

I am secretly in love with this place. Unless wearing a shirt that says "I  [heart] TMI" is not subtle enough.  I will count down the things that I love about this place:  -The Main Ale (Four Peaks-brewed blonde amazingness) -Artichoke Heaven (exactly what it sounds like) -Mindy's Mac and Cheese (a homemade recipe that is a must-order) -The Calvano (one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten) -The modern/hand-made bar -The patio -The overall ambiance   There are probably more things, but those are the main ones that keep me coming back. If you come by during their happy hours, you are doing yourself a favor. So, you're welcome.

I must say that I am super stoked that this place finally pulled down the boards covering up the windows and unleashed their tortilla-awesomeness upon us all.   I ate here for dinner the other night and was very impressed. I had the Green Chile Pork, which was soft, tender and spicy - all the things I look for in my Mexican dining experience. The real temptation that lies within this place is it's amazing, homemade tortillas. Right now, they primarily make flour, but don't fret, I have it on good authority that they are expanding to make corn tortillas as well. Literally, and I will try to be as unoffensive as possible, but you could fill that tortilla with solid waste and I would still eat it. Those tortillas are that good. If they were able to made into a blanket, I would consider buying sheets of them to adorn my house and then, obviously, my stomach.  If you go here, make sure you take the time to watch them make a few fresh tortillas. And a little bird told me that the most amazing thing on the menu thus far is the Oregano Lime Chicken. Beware - it is apt to induce restlessness because it is so good you will crave it fortnightly.   Consider yourself warned.

I'm struggling with what score to give this place. I'm wavering betwixt 3 and 4. I will round up like grade school.  I went here on a Friday night with some friends who wanted to drink and sing. This is not a normal Friday night, but an interesting combo. The suggestion of Ernie's was made, so, like sheep, we went.   Now this is far from my normal scene, and at first glance, I thought I was back in the dirty South. The first section you walk into looks like bikerville. It is smokey and dirty, a stereotypical biker bar scene. Fortunately, they value customers, so they have a separate, enclosed bar that is for karaoke. No smoke. Cleaner. I'm cool with this part of the place.   The mixed drinks were ok. The major components that made this a good experience were the wait staff and the DJ. They were both stellar. I would highly recommend this as a karaoke spot. Seriously, if you want to get drunk off your ass and sing Bohemian Rhapsody or some Sinatra tune, this is the place in Scottsdale to do it. So go get your e-oke on, yo.

I have been to almost every Pita Jungle in the Valley and this location is top 3. I always like to sit at the bar and Ashley far outweighs all the other bar experiences. She is knowledgable, friendly and knows her stuff. Ashley knows my order every time and makes me feel welcome and at home! Try their Buccaneer Wrap!
