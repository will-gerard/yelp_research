I saw an NP, Courtney, on my first visit for my annual. I had some questions and concerns because I'm trying to get pregnant, and she was very knowledgable and helpful. She was professional and patient, and took her time in explaining what I needed and wanted to know. I was initially skeptical about not seeing an actual MD at first, but she was great and I'm so glad I found this place!

Everything about this place is great. The coffee is spectacular. The food is healthy and fresh. Customer service is great. Friendly staff that will always go the extra mile to satisfy guests. (The place gets pretty busy, so don't go in expecting speedy service during breakfast/lunch rush).

It's called brick and barley now...2 stars for the service from the bartender. She just had a bad attitude and zero sense of urgency which comes off as lazy and uninterested in her job or customers.

Sat at the bar and had a couple of appetizers. Could have done without the calamari..pretty bland. Had the Il Tagliere which was great. Service was also great. We'll come back and try the pizza at some point!

We tried all of the rolls that our server suggested and everything that we had was fresh and well prepared. The ambiance was slightly boring, but our bartender was lively so that helped! We are pretty picky about sushi spots and we weren't disappointed.

My husband and I have been faithful to AMC since we moved to Ahwatukee, before the awesome remodel. We particularly love the fact that it is rarely busy, and the seats were more comfortable than Harkins or any other theater. We were pleasantly surprised today when we saw a matin√©e and stepped into one of the finished theaters (half of the theater is still being remodeled). All leather, digital reclining seats, very private, and very comfortable! Looks like a bar is being added inside the theater as well. We were happy with AMC before, and now they definitely blow the competition out of the water.

It's a great park. Fenced in, plenty of room for the dogs. Water hose and buckets on site. Always busy around sunset.

The sushi was just okay.  I couldn't get past how filthy the place was.  We sat at the bar, and it was such a mess. Not sure how they pass health code.

They do a great job. They run the business well at the front desk so that you don't wait for your services or feel rushed. I've only had pedicures there, and the quality has always been great. The place is clean with a nice atmosphere.

My husband and I come here about once a month. The food is really good, the potions are large, and the margaritas always hit the spot. They have $1 margaritas after 9pm but we rarely get here early enough for that. We either sit at the bar or in the bar area and the service has always been great.

Food is awesome! I am not sure about the service because I usually sit at the bar. Small place, but it works.

I love this place! It's my second time here, they remodeled the place since the first time I came in. It's so nice!...and the sushi is unbelievable. The surprise roll is incredible, and try the scallop hand roll, it's unique and delicious! The chef is the owner, and he makes it all right there in front of you. Great place!

Always fresh, always amazing. Great flavors. The gyro is great. The greek chicken salad is wonderful. Their tzatziki is delicious and their hummus is also great. I wish they had a location closer to my house.

Four stars for the food, service, cleanliness, and convenience. An extra star for the Green Bay Packers memorabilia. Woo!

This place started off great but I believe the main chef left and now nothing comes out as ordered.

I've never had a bad experience here. The food is outstanding. We try something new every time, and don't know much about Indian food, but are never disappointed. We usually sit at the bar, which is often empty, but the manager/owner is always there bartending and he is great! Great local beer selection as well.

Great place. Nice craft beer selection, food with local ingredients. Try the Turkey Quesadilla! And Tyler, the bartender is so friendly and knowledgeable.

Very pleased with the gel nails. The dad did mine once, and they looked perfect, natural and stayed on for at least two weeks. Tiffany is awesome as well. So glad I found them!

I enjoy this spot for it's atmosphere. The lakefront wrap-around patio is great and they remodeled the inside which is gorgeous. Great craft beer and cocktail selections. We have been here a handful of times for lunch. We also recently had our wedding reception here and they did an outstanding job with service and catering. They gave us private access to the Captain's room (pool table, couches, flat screens) as well as the area outside with dart boards. They allowed us to decorate however we wanted, and set up an outside bar for our guests (which they suggested). Also allowed us to have our own music from a PA system that they provided. The server was very attentive and went above and beyond to meet our needs. The catered food was tasty and received a lot of compliments from our guests. It couldn't have been more perfect.
