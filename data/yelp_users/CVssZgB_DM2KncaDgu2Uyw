Really, really fine selection of awesome cheeses!  Really, really good breakfast and lattes.  That's about all I can say about AJs.  Everything is ridiculously priced!  Especially the wine!  I'll stop by over and over again for their coffee.  I'm not much of a Starbucks girl :)

This could totally be a biased review because I've only been one time and tried one thing - the stuffed pizza!  Which to me is more like a huge hot pocket or some sort of Italian casserole with crust.  Wasn't a fan at all!  I do tend to give the place another shot because it was PACKED that Friday night I picked up my unsatisfying stuffed pizza!  Oh and it was expensive!  I remember that!

Yesterday makes my second time visiting The Rhythm Room.  Ironically, both times a New Orleans band bought down the house.  Be ye warned: The sound system in this Jimmy is super good so it's LOUD ... like very loud!  I like it like that though :)  Local draft beers only .. Devil's Ale is a winner!  $5.00 who can complain :)

By far the best storage experience I've ever had (and I've had some scary ones).   From the moment I contacted them via telephone, the level of customer service has been superb.  I'd use this facility over and over again if I had to and would highly recommend this faculty with no hesitation.   I hear so many good things about the manager, Kimberly but never had a chance to meet her because I only used the storage space for about 2 and a half weeks.   One thing .. there was a man practically living in his storage unit just a few doors down from mine.  I saw him shaving his legs, and picking lint from between his toes once while picking up a few things.  On another occasion I caught him "freshen up" in the bathroom downstairs.  There's lots of weirdos in the area, I was warned about this in the beginning when I signed up for a unit so I was okay with noticing a few "weird" things when visiting.

2 Words .. Happy Hour!!!  The ambiance in this place is so nice.  Rather it's for date dine, a romantic dinner or a small group dining.  It's nice!  8 of us visited Rockerij yesterday for happy hour .. amongst us we had the following:  Margaritas, Tito's straight up, Dirty Martinis, Craft Beers, Chipotle Ribs, Bacon Wrapped Shrimp, Sliders, Rich's Skewer, and Calamari ... Everything .. everything was scrumptious   There's also a reverse happy hour from 10 - close.  I must give it a try!

Today marks my second time visiting Cyprus Grill.  I must admit I was a fan after my first visit.  The first time I thought I'd stick with the basis and ordered the gyro.  I told the really nice lady behind the counter this was my first visit and she insist I try the Greek Fries.  man I'm glad I did!  Portion are just right, perfect about every everything.  I really, really like the fact that the gyros are made with roasted beef and lamb.  Yumm!  Today for lunch I tried the chicken soulaki with a side greek salad.  Just as yummy.  I couldnt finish the entire meal the first time, the chicken and salad obviously was a lot lighter.  Filled me up without feeling stuffed or hanging leftovers.  I'm a fan!

Blue Cheese Wedge Salad, Hawaiian Rib-Eye, Server's recommended Cabernet and a table for one and I'm in H-E-A-V-E-N :)  I've had Houston probably 3 or 4 times over the years.  I had no idea Hillstone was apart of Houston's family until the server told me!  One of my favorite places ever!

Disclaimer:  I'm not a huge fan of Cracker Barrel .. not sure why besides the coffee is horrible, service is ALWAYS a it or miss and no one ever gets the eggs right but .... any who! Monday morning while running errands I decided to grab Breakfast because Cracker Barrel was just  minutes away.  I ordered something small.  Hash brown casserole, bacon and biscuits.    The restaurant was pretty empty.  My server had 2 other tables besides mine, all three tables only seated a party of 1.  3 tables, 1 woman each.  The very nice server lady took my all order of only coffee, biscuits, hash brown casserole, and bacon.  She came back shortly later with has brown casserole, biscuits and fried apples.  She asked if everything was okay?  I told her yes with the exception of my missing bacon.  I say this with a small.  She apologized and told me she forgot to sub bacon instead of fried apples.  She said I'll be right back!  She came back a while later with another plan order of has browns and 2 more biscuit.  She said  sometimes like double!  Enjoy I'll be right back.  One would assume she gave me that extra order of hash browns and 2 more biscuits.  She quickly ran off to talk to the lady seated behind me.    When she finally came back she asked if everything was okay.   told her again .. Ma'am you forgot the bacon ... AGAIN!  No worries ... I'll just take the check.  he thanked me over and over for being nice even though she completely screwed up and she made me some coffee to go.    I kindly threw it in the trash immediately after I left out the restaurant!  I won't visit again!

I've been in Phoenix for about 9 months now.  I had a serious craving for only 3 things since relocating here from Maryland.  That is UTZ potato chips, a real deal Holy Field Crabcake and some good soul food.    I've tried Honey Bears because that was deemed the best soul food in Phoenix.  What a joke!  I'll save what I thought about Honey Bears for their review.  I tried LoLo's Chicken and Waffles - I'll save that one for their review as well but I will tell you that it didn't stand a change to those Bobby Q's Beef ribs... Man my mouth watered when I typed that!  Seriously, nothing else compares,  The sauce, the meat, the seasonings, the flavors .. good Lawd!  The roasted corn, the cute little bags of doughnuts they give you after your meal really is the icing on the cake!  I've only been once but remember EXACTLY how good everything was I've tasted.  I think I should take a trip to Bobby Q's this Sunday

So ... I'm adding this place to one of my favorite happy hour places!  The Mojitos are some of the Mojitios I've had in a really, really long time and the Street Tacos were so damn tasty!  I went alone but another really nice loner at the bar.  She told me I must give Ticoz a try for brunch during the weekend ... This Saturday .... I think I may :)

As a Marylander myself, I must tell you that this is one of my top 5 favorite seafood restaurants ever (including places in MD).  I had the crab and lobster bisque that was too much for one to share but I had to take it back to my hotel with me.  It's been a while, but I believe I had salmon with shrimp and I a sweet potato.  Scrumptious!   I barely are the salmon, probably took a bite and ate a shrimp or two because I was so full from bisque.  Ask if I cared?  Nope!  Wrapped that sucker up too!  Oh and let's not forget about the ambiance.. this place is gorgeous on the inside.  I'm so glad I had my work attire on because everyone else seemed to.  It was a Wednesday night by the way.    I'm going back to Phoenix in February had plan to do the same exact thing.  Shop across the street in that gorgeous mall and end my night with dinner and drinks at Wildfish :)

I relocated to Phoenix almost 2 years ago and was on a serious quest to find my "cheers" spot and a great breakfast spot.  A whole year past and I just couldn't find my favorite spot.  Then .... I found 5th Ave Cafe while driving one day and gave it a try.  Man oh man!  One of the best random decisions I've ever made lol.... this is my absolute favorite place in the Valley to get breakfast.  My favorite!  And now my boyfriend's favorite!  And now my cousin's favorite whenever she comes to visit.  It's that good!  2 of our absolute favorite dishes: Sausage and gravy, scrambled eggs and bacon.  The other is the buttery croissant sandwich with rosemary potatoes.  We've tried plenty of things, waffles, french toast, salads, plenty of things!  Everything is absolutely divine!  Give them a try!  My goodness ... I can't believe i'm just writing a review on m favorite place!

Oh Stinkweeds Record Exchange?  Just one of my favorite record stores ever!  The selection of Jazz .. Coltrane in particular is out of this world!  I almost never find Coltrane albums anywhere else besides my hometown.. Baltimore, MD, but this one always have at least one.  Lots of Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder and Jimi Hendrix.  I've been searching for Stevie's "Hotter Than July" and James Brown "The Big Payback" albums for quite a while.  I did not find them in Stinkweeds but my gut tells me I will :)

MY favorite lunch spot!  Ways too many good options to choose from.  I almost always get the half and half option.  The breads and salad dressings are house made and I believe the deserts are too!  Some of my personal favorites are: The roasted turkey sandwich  Harvest salad  Chopped salad The Roast Beef and Blue Cheese sandwich   With every order you get a small little cookie.  They are absolutely delicious!

I've had Pappadeaux in Dallas, Austin, Albuquerque and Phoenix and was more than satisfied every single time!  This is one of my favorite chain seafood restaurants!  The quality of the seafood at every location is suburb.  Big portions and flavor galore!  I must admit ... this location I think has the slowest service ... even at the bar!

Date Night for 2 this past Saturday with my boyfriend included: 2 cold Sake bombs, the Japanese beer battered cod as an appetizer and the "Samuri Warrior" (I believe that's what it's called) for the main dish ... ran us $60 bucks!    I'd never made so much for a cold sake bomb, or for Sushi that taste like I made it myself!  Nothing exceptional about it all.  This is only my 3rd time trying sushi since moving to Phoenix.  Here, Blue Water Grill and Whole Foods!  Whole Foods beats everybody else out of the water.  In addition to the mediocre sushi, the service absolutely sucks!  We probably only seen our server a total of 4 times.  Once when she took out drink orders, once when she brought the drinks back and took our order, and the third time she came when she noticed we were done and already had the bill in hand.  I careless to give this place a second try!

I took a stroll through the neighborhood during my lunch break yesterday.  I live not to far from this place and pass it just about every day .. finally gave it a shot!  I LOVE IT!  I scored Coltrane's "My Favorite Things" album for 10 bucks and The Autobiography of Malcolm X for $3 ... which has been sitting in my Amazon cart for a the price of $7 for about 2 months now).  My procrastination scored me big time :)  I still like really, really cheap books so I purchase a lot of my books from the Goodwill (books are usually have price there on Saturdays as well .. FYI) so I know I'd mainly come here to check out the half prices albums

Just now ... 6:50 pm. I walked up to the door noticed the sign says they closed at 7:00. Gave it a shot, walked in and asked do you guys close at 7 or 7:30. They said 7. I said you guys are done, asking again. He said yes... Done.  Change the damn time on Yelp! I really wanted to try this place but don't appreciate the inconvenience. I chose the place simply because it says they close at 7:30 on Yelp!!!

The Windsor is hip, swanky, cool, fast paced, LOUD, and serve really, really good damn drinks and food.  By far one of everyone's favorite.  I love the kale salad and the BLT crab cake sandwich!!

I'm from MD originally.  Our nightlife scene is drastically different from Phoenix's nightlife scene obviously.  Michael's is one of the best places to cut a rug in Phoenix.  Back East we like to start our weekends off with partying on Thursday night so Michael's ladies night event is right up my alley!    I must say I've never seen a DJ play music videos to get the party started though, I'm used to actually DJs playing hits and scratching ... but ... when in Rome ....  I've been to Michael's on Thursday nights more times than I can count and enjoy myself every single time.  My boyfriends and I finally gave Michael's a shot a couple Saturdays ago and enjoyed it as much as a Thursday night!

Great place for group dining! I hosted a brunch with my Meetup group a few months ago.  They gave us the front outside patio.  It was perfect!!!  You just can't beat a meal and beer or HUGE mimosa for a flat $10.  You just can't!!!  I'm a fan .. a huge fan!

My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place one Sunday while driving around, passing time and looking for cheap Margaritas!  This is the place for that!  @2.75 margaritas during Happy Hour.  $3.75 during regular hours.  Who can compliant right?!  My point exactly!  Both times I've been I ordered the combo fajitas (whitefish and shrimp).  They're excellent!  My boyfriend ordered the grilled zucchini for an appetizer and finished with the Grande Burrito... both excellent!  We had the pleasure of meeting some of the owners during our first visit here.  They were really, really cool, fun and nice!    Give it a shot you'll enjoy it!

I've found my Cheers :)  This place is everything you want your local neighborhood pizza joint to be!  Pizza cooked to perfection.  Just crusty, hot, finger-licking, may burn the roof of your mouth, no peppers needed, no ranch needed pizza.    This was out first time trying Federal Pizza and while driving home one night my boyfriend and I were starving and craving pizza, just stopped on by because it was a Wednesday night and a nice crowd outside.    Boy are we glad we stopped!  We started with the Mister Mister appetizer and a pitcher of a seasonal beer!  The Manifesto for dinner!  Total hits!  Seriously, this is by far some of the best pizza I had in Phoenix!  Considering giving it a shot for lunch because it's 12:05 and I have a visual of the bartender/server slowly putting fresh, shredded Parmesan cheese on my pizza before devouring a slice :)

This review is for Margaritas only - by far some of the best I've ever tasted!  The food on the other hand ... go someplace else for that unless you're only gong for drinks and bar eats. Dinner .... I'll totally pass on!  I, along with the 3 ppl I bought here enjoyed the appetizers wayyyyyyyyyyy more than the entrees!

Really cool place!  Sorta feels like Urban Outfitters with food!  My boyfriend and I gave this place a try last Saturday for lunch after running errands downtown.  I ordered the roasted pork sandwich that's only served on Fridays and Saturdays.  My significant other ordered a scrambled egg dish.  Both were delish, but we liked my sandwich a little more.  Next time I'll be sure to tell the guy behind the counter to go a little lighter on the lemon aioli.    The lemon aioli is a hit - BUT a little too much can take away from the flavors in the pork.  The cashier let us taste a piece of the pork before we ordered.  We loved it!  Once I got the sandwich, the pork flavor wasn't as potent because of the lemon aioli.  Overall, we totally enjoyed the experience and food and will definitely return!  oh .. grab a iced latte with a shot of vanilla... heaven seeping through a straw I tell ya :)

This could be a little bias because I've never tried anywhere else in Phoenix in the 2 years I've been here .. clearly that's because they're great!  "Pretty" in partciular is great!

4 stars instead of 5 because just about everything was perfect but I absolutely could not get through more than 3 bites of anything with the Jerk sauce on it.    I'd give the food a 3 starts, that extra star is there because the ambiance is pretty damn neat :)  My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch.  I ordered the stewed chicken meal with rice and peas and fried yams.  The fried yams were absolutely disgusting - honestly, one bite, my face screwed up.  Gave it another bite to ensure I didn't have a bad one - same face.  Boyfriend tries it: "Maybe we should try the Plantain next time instead" lol... I agree!  The stewed chicken was scrumptious!  I must say .. I think I like Jerk Hut's stewed chicken a little better.  My boyfriend ordered the Curry goat dinner with festivals and rice and beans.  WE LOVED the curry goat.  Nice pieces of meat on the bones, in comparison to Jerk Hut - lots of bones in goat meals.  We also enjoyed the festivals a lot more than we did at Jerk Hut.

Seriously .. what's not to like about this place!  It's in an alley .. Yes .. The alley isn't that dark or dirty ... it's a quick walk from the street to the door so no worries!!  Awesome .. I mean awesome tunes .. anything from Fela Kuti, Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings, James Brown, Hall & Oates .. just really good tunes!  The drinks are handcrafted .. fancy - like!  My favorite times to go are Sunday evenings .. Happy hour all day .. $5 Slow and Low Old Fashioned  Really cool places to enjoy a drink with friends or throw a couple back with your boo ;)

I came Kool Jerk a visit on a Sunday afternoon ... they're usually not open on Sundays but the owner told me this was there first Sunday opening.  The service was great!  The food was good ... really good.  The chicken was flavored so good but I must admit, it was a little dry.  I think it was cooked the night before.  The rice and beans were super hot and fresh, the chicken ... not so much.  Because I've been craving good Jamaican food for as long as I can remember I'm willing to give the place another try and possibly update the review to a 5 star :)

Whole in the wall ... not a great wine selection but really, really good martinis.   My girls and I gave Dirty Martini Bistro & Bar a try last Friday for Happy Hour.  It was a great start to a Friday night.  We ordered hummus and chicken wings, will pass on both next time we visit.  You go here for the Martinis and Martinis only!
