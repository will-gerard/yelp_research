Dr. Tang cares abt his patients and provides a respectful and open setting for people to get dental care. His office is always immaculate. He greets me with a smile every time I walk in to see him.

My mom goes here and sees Hannah. My mom is a tough crowd, so if she likes a place, it must be legit. I'm picky too, but I would just not return if I didn't like a place. I got Tina and she is amazing! She gives me exactly what I ask for, but far exceeds my expectations. Tina rocks my world. Mom, dad, and the daughter run the show and it's a tight ship with friendly customer service. I highly recommend getting your mani pedis here and cash is appreciated!!!

I sat and waited for 25 minutes before someone asked when I arrived. And not in a polite way, I might add. I had some extra time between appointments and thought I could get some self-care in, but instead I was ignored and wasted my time. Thumbs down to this place. I will NEVER return all tell everyone about the lack of customer service. If I could give zero stars, I would.

This place is amazing!!! We had the best server and the manager also took such great care of us, we were calling her "Mama Linda" by the end of our meal. Both our server and Mama Linda suggested the lemon ricotta pancakes and I haven't been able to stop thinking about them since we had them. My mouth is literally watering right now and I've told everyone how amazing these pancakes are!!! They have the best Bloody Mary bar I've ever seen, cheese sticks, pickled everything, and house made tomato juice. Besides the magical pancakes, we had the fried chicken Benedict, YES. The combination of the hollandaise sauce and maple syrup reduction was outstanding. Btw, we also had the cannoli donuts. #bestbreakfastEVER
