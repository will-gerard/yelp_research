This was my first time here. I was skeptical due to the reviews but I tried it anyway. There was a wait which is understandable. Once I was in, they apologized and thanked me for waiting. I got a pedicure and full set white tip nails. Peter was amazing and listened to what I asked for. I would recommend this place!! Thanks Peter!

I went here for the first time a couple months ago. I had to wait for about an hour. Once I got in, everything was ok until I asked to get a design with stripes which I got some funky design and I asked to get a nail different color and she forgot and so she put the color over the color instead of taking the wrong color off and putting the right one on. I would not go back.

I went in for the first time today. I LOVED the sriracha honey wings! I love that they are fried and yummy! I am still on the border about the ranch but it works. Nothing wrong with it but it's homemade! I love the flavors. I got the sriracha honey and mango habanero. I love that it is convenient for me to go and grab wings when I get the craving. I don't have to drive! Overall satisfied. The fries might have been a little burnt. Must try!

I went to this place when they first opened and I didn't like it but decided to go back due to new owners. I had great service and my nails and pedicure came out perfect. Thanx the our owner (forgot his name) for my nails and Gina for making my toes look awesome. I know they were very upset due to some crazy customer but I commend you and your staff for not losing your cool in front of us customers. I would recommend this place.
