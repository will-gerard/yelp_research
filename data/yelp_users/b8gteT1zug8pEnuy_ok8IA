Love the chips and salsa but I think they need a little more variety. However, they make up for it with some other great options for lunch. The #9 is my go to though..

Been going to this place since it's inception and must say, they use the best ingredients which makes their food taste incredible. Hope they keep doing what their doing...

Usually get the carne asada burrito but today I got the 2 chicken soft tacos lunch special. They were awesome and with their got salsa, even better. I just don't like the parking..

Have to give a little review here since I did about the other location on 3rd and Bell. This location is by far superior over the bell road location. I never have any issues when asking for the hand wash where I would have to stand outside the other location and wait until they pulled my SUV in the auto wash line to tell them that it is a hand wash. Seriously, every single time they would pull into the auto line when I said and paid for hand wash.   This location, only once, which is for the 4 stars...

I love this location. The atmosphere here is a great way to start your day if you're not a morning person. A lot of people, high energy and quick service.

My wife and I come here with the kids about once a week since they hooked me in with their turkey sandwich.  Always a great experience and they give the kids crayons to keep them busy too!

Not sure if I will be back. Tried this one out because of the location and they didn't seem to be at all interested in what I asked for. Back to the Raintree location for me...
