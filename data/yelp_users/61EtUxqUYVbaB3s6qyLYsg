Service was slow and the food wasn't very flavorful not a fan won't be back. Which is a shame because I loved the atmosphere

Other than our waitress Laurel, there was little about our stop in that could be recommended.  We waited 15 mind before someone took their time to greet us. Once we were seated Laurel was quick to take our drink order. She was quick efficient and very friendly. Food came out fairly quickly but my order was incorrect which was taken care of by our server as soon as I brought it to her attention. The food was not bad but it wasn't outstanding either the cheese on my mushroom swiss burger wasn't even fully melted.. probably won't return. Sad because I usually enjoy Red Robin.

Loved everything we tried smoked turkey, brisket, chicken, pulled pork ribs amazing. Kids loved their meals too...only thing we had a small issue with was the kids mac and cheese has jalape√±os  in it and we didn't know it when we ordered so the little one wouldn't eat that, but he filled up on our food so it wasn't a loss because we enjoyed it.

Wonderful chef, funny and engaging we went for my 7 year olds birthday because he wanted Benihana which I find overpriced. He wanted to watch them cook in front of us. This place did not disappoint and to top it off was quite a bit cheaper I call this a win win. Flavors were on point, atmosphere was charming and the waitstaff was attentive and fun. We were seated right away and the food wasn't far behind. We ordered gyoza which was delicious with just the right amount of crunch, the chicken teriyaki was amazing and a sizable portion. The kids had steak and although it was a kids meal the size was enough to feed an adult. I will definitely be back!
