I had previously been to Switch and had a mediocre experience with their breakfast and cocktails.  This past Saturday 3 of my friends and I decided to give it a try before we passed judgement. Three of us order burgers medium rare with salad, the burgers looked as though they were straight from package with grill lines already on them. One of my friends picked up his burger to take a bite out of it and greased poured out of it. The Cesar dressing had to come from a bottle as the salad was definitely bag salad. To add insult to injury our waiter was incompetent at best and had zero personality

The portions are huge! You can definitely get one dish and share with a friend.  Friendly staff, great food. Such a refreshing change from the former restaurant that was too pretentious for my taste.  I am not sure where the name come... They are dog friendly, next time we go we're going to load up the dog and come back for brunch!

Though this place is a little hard to see from the street definitely make the effort to find it! Great decor, very friendly staff, good food. The nan bread was a little too cooked but tasty overall.  I was there for the lunch menu and I was shocked to see there were not more people there. The price is typical for Indian buffet..I think 10-11 per person. My favorite was their house curry, it has been a few weeks since I have been there but have not stopped thinking about that dish!

Great food, the Head of the House is awkward, lacks passion and personality  I have been anxious for a Tapas place ever since Mexican Stand Still was to open in the space that is now Tapas Papa Frita.  So needless to say I was very optimistic when I saw a new restuarant was taking place of Mexican Standoff.   When we went there, we were in jeans and t-shirts which several other patrons were also wearing.  I don't know if it is because I have visible tattoos or if it is the lack of personality of the front of the house that caused the awkward interactions with him.  We walked in and he awkwardly shook our hands, like he was sizing us up??? It was very odd I didn't know how or what to make of it.  When we told him that there was just the two of us he asked if we wanted a table or sit at the bar.  When we said table, he said he liked starting people off at the bar.  When I asked why he couldn't really give me a reason.    After being sat I began worrying that this was an awful decision.  But then our amazing waiter, Timothy came out and was great! He made great recommendations and was friendly and very conversational.  We each ordered 4 tapas each out of which the oxtail, monk fish were the favorites.   The Head of the House walked around and it seemed almost like he was too shy or embarrassed as he approached tables around the restaurant.  When he came to the tables and asked us how we were doing not trying to engage us, it felt as I should have been at a Olive Garden. Engage me! Talk to me more about the food, the region the Chef is from.  I am at your new restaurant?  Cocktails:   On their website they list the sangrias, specialty cocktails and martinis when I asked about the cocktails and martinis they replied that they didn't have any but there was a full bar.  Not Timothy's fault, he is new and the restaurant so I will let that slip.     Ambiance - I would give it an A+ the views, decor spot on.  When you go into the men's restroom there are the beatnik paintings that were in Digestif by the bar...not sure what that has to do with Spain.   Overall, I would go back even with the head of house who is lacking personality and passion.  When I go back I will definitely ask to sit in Timothy's section!

I have been here several times and have not had a bad experience.  I have to say everytime I have been here I have had different wait staff and they have been very friendly and knowledgable.  The food has been consistently good, I had the veggie scramble, chocolate chip pancakes and a few of the startes over cocktails.  Good price point, nice welcoming venue and good staff.   I will definately be coming back.
