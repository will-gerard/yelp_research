Went here on a sunday, had to bus my own table..and waited 30 minutes for water which never came..finally just went to the bar for service and thankfully JOE was awesome! Food and drinks are great for the price. Worst part was the waitress who was supposed to be serving us watched us bus our own table, grab our own drinks, napkins,ect. Apparently thanks to autograt our "server" gave no service yet we still had to tip her (alyssa b according to our receipt) although JOE was the only staff who made us feel acknowledged and welcomed. 5 stars goes to JOE unfortunately the rest of our service was barely even a 1. Thanks Joe!

I was greeted immediately by Micheal, he was extremely hospitable and was willing to answer all of my amateur sushi questions. Really nice to meet someone who was humble and genuinely helpful.  Prices are awesome for the amount of food and quality. Kamikaze bowl is delicious !!   Will definitely go there over rah any day.

Not typically the person who is excited to go to a kabob place but this place not only has great kabobs but a world of even better food. The sauces on the table (red and green) are full of amazing spice and flavor that's hard to encounter most places. The Granache red wine pairs unexpectedly well with the food also. Quality and diversity of food and flavors definitely deserves the five star rating. Haven't tried breakfast here yet but I'm looking forward to it! Also had the pleasure of meeting the owner who seemed very genuine and concerned with quality of guests experience. Do yourself a favor and try this place ASAP it will not disappoint !

Stumbled in here on a Thursday as I was leaving the mall, to my surprise found out every tequila is half priced..EVERY Thursday! The bartender Colby was super sweet and told me a ton about the background of some of the menu items and cocktails. Although I heard they are known for their gourmet street tacos I took a risk and ordered the Shrimp Stuffed Chile Rellano and man I'm sure happy I did! It had bacon, avocado, tomatoes, queso fresco and so much more goodness inside.  In addition to the classic sides of rice and beans they also included a zucchini and squash blend that was served in some sort of really taste sauce. I probably would of tried to squeeze in dessert if they're complimentary chips and salsa weren't so good! LOL  Also the Pink Paloma margarita is served with this grapefruit soda in a massive glass and I highly recommend trying one! Everything was great, I will certainly be back next Thursday to try the tacos...and more tequila.

Went here on a Tuesday night to check out the $22 Pizza & Wine Special. I assumed it was going to be a generic personal size cheese pizza and a house wine but boy was I wrong! First of all they let you choose from any of their pizza's, and a whole list of wines. My friend and I shared the Burrata appetizer, which was super tasty. Its home made burrata topped with wilted kale, balsamic reduction and this apricot mustarda stuff which is a perfect pairing. Also no clue what the kale was seasoned with but really flavorful! We got the Sicilian pizza and it was perfect. My favorite thing about the pizza was that instead of using your typical pepperoni which leaves way too much oil and grease, they import some sort of spicy soppressata instead! Meatballs were really tender and the Sharps Hill wine was fantastic. We finished the last drop and bite of everything! Copper & Jen were our bartenders, both were very knowledgeable and welcoming. Between the staff, atmosphere, food and drink ... I'll definitely be back!
