Holy grease balls! Yes I know Howies isn't the"best" pizza around but I wish their locations would be consistent! When I lived in south Scottsdale it always came fresh! I went to this location and picked up(should be fresher) and it was a pile of grease with a pizza in it. Please make this location better!!!

I love my new remote start and tinted windows! I'm now ready to take on the AZ heat this summer!

Nothing better than finishing a long work day with some Cornish happy hour! Great craft beer selection and my fav pasty the portobello chicken! Best "chill" atmosphere.

The drive thru is so convenient. One of the best iced lattes in the area!  These guys definitely know their espresso! Reasonable prices and friendly service. This is my go to coffee place before work in the morning, for my midday coffee on my days off, and my any day afternoon pick me up! Perfect cold beverages for the summer heat!

I always only go for a simple pedicure at the nail salon. Relaxing nails really took their time on my nails and did a great job. My favorite was the hot stone massage! This will definitely be my go to nail salon in the area!

Love the nachos at the blind pig! I've only had a few things from here but everything I've had has been delicious! Oh also the mushroom quesadilla!!!
