Cheap drinks but the bar and scene is very ghetto for being in Gilbert. They have a stage with old big screen tvs on it when it can be used for entertainment. All the other tvs are over 10 years old. Did I also mention the homeless man hanging out the the smokers area....terrible food bad service but hey you definetly get what you pay for.

Best food and service ever. Perfect way to celebrate any special occasion.

Nates Third Base is an example of how local businesses can still thrive in the valley. They have absolutely the very best burger and frys in town. The owner Nate Myers always treats his customers and repeat customers like that are members of his own family. Best place to see a Red Sox, Patriots, Celtics or Boston Bruins game outside of New England. If you are ever in the Dobson and Ray area of Chandler its a must you stop in for lunch, dinner or if you ate looking for local nightlife. Especially of you are a native of the New England area and like myself you are sick of the same old "chain" bar/restaurants.
