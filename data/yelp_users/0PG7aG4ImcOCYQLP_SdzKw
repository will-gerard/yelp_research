Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport falls somewhere in the bottom-middle when it comes to the wide spectrum of airports in the states. I didn't encounter anything as bad as some of the more negative reviews here, but it also lacked modern conveniences and has a nonsensical design. In short, it did the bare minimum as far as transitioning me into my destination.   Least impressive to me was the food selection. A couple fast food joints and a lot of magazine stands but little else, at least in my terminal. Do I want an energy bar or a double cheeseburger? Lack of options makes for one cranky traveler. The Wifi wasn't working at all on my departure and I was forced to use my phone as a hotspot. Apparently I wasn't the only one, according to the blabbermouth next to me.   On the plus side, I did breeze through check in and security. I think that had more to do with the timing of my flights than anything.

High above the Arizona dessert sits Orange Sky, a super classy restaurant with a stunning view of the surrounding mountains and cityscape. The meal itself was a three star experience, but when you consider the incredible ambiance, I could have been eating McDonalds and wouldn't have cared.   I was more than impressed with the atmosphere before we even sat down. We waited for our seats on a glass balcony that protected us from the wind and while standing at the handsome curved bar. Walking to our table, we passed many an elegant private room and some booths with views that would have made for perfect date nights. Our group made reservations far in advance, so we were guaranteed a lovely patio setting with panoramic views.   The service was prompt and consistent. My only beef (no pun intended) was with the beef tenderloin, two four ounce cuts presented plainly and without any accompaniments on a large white plate. Talk about feeling like you didn't get your moneys worth. The beef was tasty, but it left me hungry enough that I needed sides and to share someone else's plate just to be full.   That one dish was the only hiccup. Other than that, you can expect a memorable dining experience that you'll surely be reccomending to friends!

This is one of those meals that was made all the better by an incredible server. In our case his name was Andy and his personality, knowledge of the menu and dry wit kept our group entertained while we enjoyed their incredible dining options. Her Box management, take note: Andy is someone you're going to want to hold on to on your staff.   Beyond the friendly back-and-forth with the server, our meal was exquisite. I mulled over a couple menu items like the fried chicken but quickly decided that the filet mignon was what I needed. I couldn't have been happier with that decision after slicing off and biting into a piece of the tender,  melt-in-your-mouth meat. The seasoning was just amazing and almost worth making another trip to AZ for. I tried my friends Thai-style ribs and found them equally delicious. The two together made a heavenly sweet and savory combo.   The entrees weren't the only impressive edibles. The mac n' cheese, with a unique, herby creaminess and the signature cocktails were also winners in my book. I'd easily bring back a large party for another fantastic dinner. Especially if Andy entertains!

I stopped in for a couple beers with some buddies after a meal up the street. This is a spacious and clean bar in the middle of a nice, more upscale shopping center. The large patio area would be perfect for soaking in the evening air or a large group gathering, and the large horseshoe bar had plenty of space to belly up should you want to spend a lot of time here.   Our server was sweet and attentive and the beer selection pretty decent. All in all, a great watering hole for those in the area.

For yet another "American (New)" salad and sandwich eatery, I was more than impressed with the offerings at the Original ChopShop Co.  After a brief wait to order inside, my friends and I sat outside on their spacious patio and soaked in the sun while enjoying our dishes. I opted for the BBQ Chicken salad, a delectable combination of house greens, chicken, cheddar, corn, green onion, tomato, corn nuts, cilantro, and a ranch dressing. It was all very tasty, although I wish it was a larger serving considering I still could have eaten more and it was the most expensive salad on the menu. But combined with one of their flavored iced teas and the thought that I need to diet, it worked out well.   The patio area is especially nice for just lounging when the weather isn't too horrifically hot. There are shared areas and big group tables in the sun.

"Obviously, you're not a golfer"  That line from The Big Lebowski echoed in my head as we drove to Topgolf, where I was sure my lack of golfing skills would be made apparent for the whole world to see. on the contrary, it turned into one of the most fun group outtings I've ever had thanks to laid-back atmosphere, a top-notch facility and plenty of liquor.   Our group reserved two sections on the second deck. Walking to our location, I was already impressed by the vastness of the facility, with multiple levels of folks driving their balls off into the horizon and a massive bar inside where people caroused and watched sports. Our section consisted of some comfy furniture, driving greens with a cool laser-operated ball feeder and some handy electronic scoreboards. My game didn't improve much, but I had a blast and our friendly servers kept the green beer (it was St. Patrick's Day) and tasty apps flowing.   This mixture of low key athleticism, socializing and drinking make Topgolf a perfect spot for a date, a group outting or a solo meditation getaway. I just hope they eventually open a branch in my neck of the woods!

I loved my stay at the Graduate. After years of staying at overpriced and unimpressive hotels in the Bay Area for work, it was nice to stay at a hotel that perfectly encapsulates value and experience.   My room was southwestern in every respect, from the American Flag throw blanket to the desert paintings on the walls. My bed was comfortable and, most importantly, very clean. The air conditioner worked almost too well, but I'm sure it would come in handy in the middle of an Arizona summer. Shower pressure was also tip top. And my favorite part? Pump soap. Yep, I'm a big fan of refilled pump soap containers as opposed to those minuscule soaps and shampoos most places give out.   The Graduate's real selling points are downstairs. The pool and hot tub, which are open 24 hours, are a great place to relax. Their staff even comes out with water and extra towels. The attached restaurant has a fine selection of eats and a big open-air bar for folks to socialize around.   Arizona State sits right across the street. Those kids are working a lot harder for their graduation. All I had to do was pay for it.

A pretty solid breakfast option, especially if you're staying at the neighboring Graduate hotel. My large group of thirteen had no trouble finding seats for breakfast on two consecutive weekday mornings during Spring Training.   For me, the standout on their menu is the Gringo Burrito. I usually have an aversion to anything in burrito form until after noon, but the mouthwatering description of chorizo, yukon potatoes, white cheddar, spinach, salsa verde, and eggs in a fresh warm tortilla was like a siren call to my stomach. On my second visit I ordered the minimum wage breakfast -  a well-rounded, classic breakfast dish hat didn't live up to the burrito. I should have gone gringo twice.   the service was on point as well considering we took the place by storm when they were otherwise almost empty. Any spot that brings out the food for a party our size hot and on time is on its game.

Is there any Mexican food in Scottsdale that isn't out of this world? that's what I was asking myself after lunching at Diego Pops, one of numerous impressive eateries I visited while on a work trip.   (I should preface my review of the food itself with a disclaimer of sorts: This isn't truly authentic Mexican food. In fact, I've found very, very few places north of the border that could qualify as such. Diego Pops definitely appeals to a more touristy demographic and the local college scene.) However, that makes them no less delicious. The braised green chili chicken taco includes an incredibly flavorful mixture of crema, cotija and house slaw. I highly recommend getting it on the crispy tortilla for that perfect combination of taste and texture. The grilled shrimp was equally tasty, served atop corn salsa, red onion, queso oaxaca and salsa verde.   I could see this place becoming sort of a madhouse at peak hours, but thankfully we ate a late lunch and avoided any real rush. The outdoor patio, with big tables and a slatted overhang to keep you semi-protected from the sun, is a great place to eat and drink. If I could suggest changing anything, it would be to recommend just a plain iced tea to serve. I don't need the fancy stuff.

The Yard was a pleasant surprise that more than exceeded my expectations for a large, popular dining establishment in Tempe. Those preconceived notions conjured up images of bland food and a menu similar to something like an Applebee's. Boy, was I wrong. And I certainly wasn't expecting to perfect my cornhole game in the process.   My group sat down at a long table we had reserved ahead of time. I could spend a lot of time on flowery descriptions of our dishes, but that just echoes the sentiment of many a previous review. For me, the meal began and ended with the pretzels and cheese. These soft, warm, sweet/savory-on-the-outside bites of heaven, along with a healthy dipping into their signature cheese sauce, were the best I've ever had when it comes to pretzel appetizers. I could have easily demolished a few baskets, and in hindsight I probably should have. Carbs be damned. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of other strong points on the menu (like the ribs), but if you leave here without ordering the pretzels, you've missed out on a golden opportunity.   After our meal, we headed over to the spacious game section and did a little boys v. girls cornhole match. It was a great way to burn off our meal. And The Yard is a great place for anyone in the area.
