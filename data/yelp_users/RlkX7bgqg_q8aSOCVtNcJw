I gave this place 2.5 stars.   Being a fan of Hawaiian BBQ, I was excited to check out this place after reading all these great reviews. However, I was quite disappointed with my visit.   First off, the ambient looks old and tacky. The servers' straight faces while interacting with customers didn't help. I felt like they could care less about what they're doing there.   Regarding the food, I wanted to try the manupua but they don't offer it on Sundays. Additionally, when I put in an order for fried saimin, they didn't have the charsiu originally (or spam to substitute either). So I ended up with a mini order of chicken katsu to go.   The food came out really fast. The potato - mac salad is indeed flavorful and addicting. Chicken was crispy from the outside and juicy inside. Although it's a mini order, the portion is really good for the money you spent. I also like how they have two self-serve stations of water, one regular and one is cucumber infused.   Overall, great food and portion! Not so impressed with the ambient or service though.

Carnitas and Guacamole. That's all I need to say.   So glad they brought the carnitas back because this No-Chipotle-til-Carnitas-is-back boycott that I was doing is getting really difficult.

Very tasty pesto grilled chicken and Hawaiian pizza. And I'm not even a fan of pizza! The size of their slices is even bigger than my face. They also serve awesome garlic bread and wings.  Delicious food. Quick service. Great price. Clean place. You can't go wrong if even Heisenberg himself, loves their food ;)

It was late and we just got off the plane from a tiring flight. Decided to try Rally's for the first time since it was pretty much the only thing on the way home that was still open. I was also kind of excited to try it out given the really good experience I had with its brother company Checkers before.   Anyway, we ordered a baconzilla combo and a 5 parm garlic wings combo. That was it. Nothing complicated!  Drove all the way home just to find out we somehow ended up with 2 sodas (yes), a small order of fries (yes), a baconzilla sandwich (yes), a spicy chicken sandwich (nope), and a big box of parm galic FRIES (NO NO NO!). More fries, yet my 5 pieces of wings are nowhere to be seen??!   The small regular order of fries was pretty tasty and crunchy. But the baconzilla, the chicken sandwich and the big order of parm garlic fries was very bland, soggy, and cold. So I only had half of the regular fries and my soda. The rest was given to my friends who just ate it because they didn't want to waste so much food.   It was almost 11pm. I ended up going to bed still hungry and disappointed because I paid almost $15 and all I got was a bit of fries and sprite :(

Gotta say Casey Moore would be my go-to bar around ASU when I feel like just chilling with some drinks or to pre-game before heading over to the dance-scenes on Mill. This hipster haven not only offers the perfect cool, aesthetically-pleasing and relaxing environment, but they also serve tasty food and awesome drinks. Service is also standard, though sometimes I do get extra friendly and attentive servers.  My favorites about this place are the green twinkle starry lights in the trees, fried zucchini, clams chowder, and drinks.    In short, I only have great things to say about this place. The one reason I gave this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because there's a lot of smoking going on during my dining/drinking experience. But then again, I guess it won't be a hipster haven after all, if it's not smoking-friendly. So be prepared to do tons of secondhand smoking if you like me - a non-smoker who can seriously care less for cigarettes smoke.   Nonetheless, it definitely worth a try!

Tried to come in for an MLS game LA Galaxy vs. Seattle Sounders on Sunday afternoon. The sign said "Please seat yourself" so we did. The A/C was blasting where our table was so we moved to another table on the other side of the dining room.   Food: We weren't really hungry so we ordered a 32 oz. beer, two baskets of muchies: one fries and one onion rings. The food came out fairly quickly. However, I was so disappointed with the quality of our orders. How can you mess up on fries and onion rings? Onion rings were hard and tasted frozen. On the other hand, our fries were soggy and tasteless.  An hour later, I ordered some chicken wings hoping it would be better. And they were! However, they are still pretty mediocre.  Service: our waitress was attentive and checked on us often. I told her I don't like buffalo flavor on my wings so she brought out my wings naked with different sauces on the side.   One really annoying thing I had to say was the music they were playing. Being a sports bar, their customers will most likely come in to watch a sport game. Yet they were playing this playlist varied from alternatives, classic rock to pop, country, and edm (?!) It was distracting and seriously killed the mood. Imagine watching an action movie with classical instruments playing very softly in the background...   Overall, microwave, frozen food. Good service. Weird taste of music. I don't think I'll come back on my own. However, maybe it's just this location since I had better experience with Zipps in Tempe.   P/s: they have a really random beer menu, yet no Sam Adams.

What's up with all the hype for this place??!   I mean...YES! It could NOT be more true! I gotta admit, I am another fan among your already-solid fan base, The Coffee Shop :)   What not to love about this place? Sleek and clean interior, amazing food and pastries, energetic and friendly staff, and a good variety of coffee drinks to choose from if you just wanna chill by the patio and savor a cup of coffee. This place is perfect for a coffee and pastries date with your girl friends, a brunch date with your significant other, or just some quality family bonding time in general.    So enough said, bring your children, your pets, your grandparents, your foodie friends, your first date, or whoever share the same love for food like you do. There is a little bit of everything for everyone. You won't be disappointed.

Clean, fast, and affordable mexican dishes with fresh ingredients. Perfect to stop for a quick take-out.

The 2 stars I gave this restaurant is for the food and the food alone. We ordered Banh Xeo and Pho Tai. They were both really good. There, I acknowledged that their food was good. However, that will be the only great thing I have to say in this review.  The service I received was a nightmare. We waited for almost an hour for our food, about 45 mins for the server to even noticed us sitting there with nothing on the table and finally brought us some water. I made eye contacts with the servers quite a few times and somehow he always avoided us instead of coming over and asked if we need anything. The food was brought out 45 mins after we ordered and we had to wait another 15 mins to ask for some utensils. I noticed two tables came in way after we did, got there food and left before our food even came out. So I dont know why our table got such bad service?!   Will never come back again even though the food was decent. Sorry.

I must have passed by this place about hundred times every time I hung out on Mill Ave; but it wasn't until Sunday two weeks ago that I finally got a chance to discover yet another eatery gem in Tempe. Since my "great" discovery two weeks ago, I have already been here 3 times total. That means something!   The cafeteria style fits in with the fiesta/Sun Devils theme decor of the place. You stay in line, order food, then pay. If you happen to order alcoholic beverages as well, the cash register will ID you then ask you to wait right at the counter for your beverages; before you walk away to sit down and wait for your food order no. to be called.   I came in for Taco Tuesday with an order of 3 crispy tacos: tempura fish, shredded pork and shredded beef. They are all good but my personal favorites are tempura fish and shredded pork - so flavorful and fresh with different spices and textures. The tacos are decent sized topped with queso fresco, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and ranch dressing!  Besides the delicious bites, their variety of magaritas paired with different beer is great hit, also. So far I have tried their Shocker and SunDevilrita and they are both refreshing with just enough amount of alcohol to get your buzz on. They also offer Corona on tap which I often don't see in other places.   Overall, great place to eat, drink, hang out with your pals, celebrate taco tuesdays, cinco de drinko, or any other random fiestas that your inner party-self wishes. Decent portion and value. The only reason why I gave this place a 4 instead of 5 is I feel that the place could have been a little bit cleaner and brighter.

I've been here multiple times and never had one bad experience with this place. The owners and staff here are super friendly, pleasant, and welcoming.   The shop decor isn't anything fancy. Just a typical authentic NYC bagel shop with fresh bagels made daily, a variety of awesome cream cheeses and toppings, pleasant Jewish owners, diverse staffing and random black and white photos of NYC landmarks. Every time I step into this shop, it feels like I just teleported myself to NYC.   Great food, awesome people, perfect NYC ambient. The best part is the price you pay is so not NYC! Looking forward to trying out more items on the menu.

There is nothing negative about this place. The food is delish! The presentation is too beautiful to eat. Service is amazing! Ambient is great! And best of all, it is affordable for the quality you get. This gem is definitely my go-to place whenever I wanna take my friends out for brunch. We ordered a 2 breakfast burros: one regular and one with chorizo - delish'! Got some complimentary chipotle popcorn to try while waiting for our food. As we were finishing up our crepes, the server came out with a plate of rose marshmallows and a torch. He roasted the marshmallows right in front of our eyes and left after saying "It's on the house. Enjoy guys! ;)" I also checked in on Yelp and got my delicious lemongrass tea for free.  It is my second time here and it's just getting better everytime. Love it!

Food: huge portion! I like how they let you customize your soup with different broths, noodles and toppings. Although the menu is confusing, especially for those who can't read Mandarin/Cantonese (I'm not sure which one exactly), just go for whatever sounds good to you; since everything I've tried so far is pretty tasty. I've had the original fish broth, malay laksa, tomyum, instant noodles, korean clear noodles, fish fillets, HK style wontons, shrimp, bokchoy, fried pork, fried buns, etc. I'm looking forward to come back and try more combinations of soup to find my favorite of all.   Service: this is the reason why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5. Service is so-so. Servers don't seem to care much about you after they dropped off your food. Every time I ask for iced water, I always have to repeat myself multiple times with different servers. It makes me feel like they don't want to spare a glass of ice water for me since they charge $1 extra for cold drinks. Additionally, unless I ask for it, I never got my water refilled.   Location: they are right at the entrance to the food court of Mekong Plaza. I never have to wait for a table though they always have decent amount of people dining. You just walk right in and sit wherever.   Overall, pretty good place to come for just a huge tasty bowl of noodle soup. Will come back to try more things on the menu.

I've been here for lunch/dinner takeout a few times and have never been disappointed.   The staff are friendly. Food is tasty. Good portion for the money you paid. The place is nice and clean. Great location with plenty parking spots.   Overall, awesome and affordable place to casually grab lunch/dinner, especially when you are in the rush back to your office. Will recommend for others.

First off, I love how open and hipster - looking this restaurant is. The staff is nice. You can spot the manager keep going around checking on customers. Their tacos are great with beautiful presentation. Tortilla soup has a fresh taste with a subtle kick so be careful if you're not good with spicy food.  I came during happy hour so I decided to order a fresh pineapple  juice with rum. However, I'm pretty sure they forgot to put rum in there. The manager happened to check on us right then so I told him I didn't really taste the alcohol. Immediately, I watched him making me a new drink at the bar. This time, he made sure he filled the glass with what tasted like 50% rum ;) Great service recovery. Will definitely come back again to try another dish on the menu.

Best BANH XEO in the Chandler, Gilbert, Tempe area, in my opinion, at the very least. When I order banh xeo at other Vietnamese restaurants, it either comes out soggy or gets soggy toward the end. This one, on the other hand, is light and crispy until the last bite! The portion and dipping sauce are great, too. One banh xeo is perfect to offer me a happy full tummy. It is just too good to pass and order something else whenever I visit this place. Although they also serve very decent Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle soup).   So do yourself a favor and try their banh xeo. This is how a quality, authentic banh xeo suppose to be!

It was my first time here for lunch, after hearing tons of good reviews and recommendations from my friends. Gotta say I wasn't disappointed! :)  The interior is spacious, nice and clean; unlike other typical smoky asian/korean BBQ places. The staff was very attentive and helpful. We ordered the spicy pork bellies and spicy squid and pork bellies with rice combos. Our orders came out about 10-15 mins afterward with all the side dishes. I specifically really enjoyed the steamed eggs. On the other hand, I didn't care too much for the sausage side dish.   The only thing I was confused was the fact that my spicy pork bellies combo and my dad's spicy squid and pork bellies combo cost the same. Look at the picture you will understand. My dad's order was almost double my order size.   Overall, everything was great! Food was really tasty. Awesome service. Nice ambient. Decent price. Will definitely come back and recommend to others.

Mediocre everything: food, drinks, beer selections, services, portion, prices, etc. The only a-okay things they offer here are the zipparitas and a cool tv system setup that can be combined together to make a big screen for the game.  And this mediocre level is consistent throughout their chains from Gilbert location to Mill Ave.   I really hope you will try to do better in the near future, Zipps.
