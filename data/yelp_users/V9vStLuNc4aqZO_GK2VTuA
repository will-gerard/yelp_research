last night was my first time at this restaurant that my sweetheart, Matt,  has been coming to since he was about 3.  he did mention the no windows thing, which initially bothered me, but that was before we went inside.  it's a small restaurant with a fish tank/weird stick fountain thing that i found pretty, maybe 25 tables MAYBE, the ONLY thing i didn't like about this place was that the bathrooms were smack in the middle of the dining floor. never have seen that before.  ANYHOW, i mentioned Matt has been eating here most of his life, he told me that the owner knew him well. i was skeptical, but WRONG. she gave him a playful jest and was very nice, even bringing us some complimentary crab angels.  they bring you wonton chips before you order, like chips and salsa at a mexican food place! i was immediately ecstatic, as i have a fondness for anything deep-fried. we ordered appetizers, crab angels and egg roll. for the entree, i ordered the beef with onions which was phenomenal, although it was listed as a spicy dish all they did was put  some dried red chile peppers in which i had to bite into for any spice.  Matt got garlic beef, which had delicious flavor, but i found it a bit dry.  the portions are enormous, by the way. we both have another full meal. they bring you a tasty sweet wonton treat at the end of your meal that has mashed banana inside. i could do without the powdered sugar though.  i am sad that i've lived my life without this place for so long. definitely going back.

can i give 6 stars?  reheated leftovers last night and they were delicious. not at all weird like leftovers can get.  AND i was full when we left the restaurant with our leftovers, i didn't think i brought that much home...i was full again last night. i am so happy with this place!  i will probably want to go here again this saturday night!

i keep going here. i don't really know why. i think maybe they're using an addictive chemical that makes me crave it fortnightly!  better than the one on university.  delicious salty chips and 2 different salsas. giganto sodas.  average tacos (the chips and salsa make up for it).  probably will go there tomorrow.

the only thing that's even halfway decent here is breakfast.   don't order dinner here unless you have self respect issues.  they have good toast.  sad that this is all i have to say, isn't it?  that's really how i feel.

i like this one better than the one on mckellips, it's not always jam packed full of people (like me) wanting cheap smokes.  the cashiers are grumpy (which i sometimes enjoy) and there's just a certain special quality to the entire shop.  they also have a drive up window!  if you smoke, go here.

i'm only giving this place four stars because i haven't actually been in, just take out and Matthew went to go pick it up.  i must say, super delicious. the gyro i ordered was huge and meaty, just like i like it. Matthew got falafel, which i hate, but he said it was fantastic. it came with lentil soup, which was terribly comforting, although unfamiliar territory for me. it was a wonderful discovery,    they just finished remodeling, so i think it may be time to go and dine in. i'm excited.

my little girl, Phoebe: Dog of Wonder is a hairy child. and not the most cooperative.  these nice ladies treated her well, followed my (very particular) instructions and she came home happy! not at all nervous, that makes me happy and it also makes me a life long customer!  thank you so much!!!!

if you love and remember Don Jose's, you'll like this place.  the food is average and they do charge extra for chips and salsa (which is good and spicy!), but there's something about this place that keeps us coming back.   i finally tried the bean burro last night, and it is the reason for my Don Jose's reference. i have been searching for beans like that for years and i FOUND THEM HERE!!!!!!!!!!   in short, i've tried several things on the menu, the bean burro is by far my favorite with the joanne special a close second.

one star knocked off because they blew into my interlock (yes, i know. CLASSY! just paying for my mistake) and missed a running test. aside from the EWWWWWWWWW factor, since they didn't tell me they did that, this is a pretty great place.  they're honest, fairly priced and quick. i recommend this place to anyone that drives and does not fix their vehicle themselves.  and they did make up for the interlock by replacing my gas cap at no charge to me. at least the owner made the effort and that goes a very long way with me.

really good, except the spicy tuna roll which is my favorite thing everywhere else.  super nice staff, nice small restaurant.  do believe it's family owned.  we're definitely going back.

ok. so i've been eating at the location on 7th ave my whole life.  decided to try the northern location.  hmm...upon entry, it looks like it used to be a chinese restaurant.  knowing los compadres isn't exactly upscale, the food is what i expected and i love their beans as i always have.  the salsa is different than the 7th ave location (at least it seemed to be) and i found that a little disappointing.  the service...was less than stupendous. "are you ready?"  "do you know what you want?"  oh and my favorite..."do you want your check now or what?". not, would you like dessert, are you ready for your check, would you like a box or anything like that.  completely rude.  so. i'll eat there again, but i'll get it to GO.

i'm a former resident, i lived at this property for 3 years. for the first 2 years, i lived in an upstairs unit, facing west. i liked the unit and the price 940 sq ft for about $800 with pet rent, water/sewer and taxes. not too bad. however, this unit had zero insulation. the temperature in the living room could be anywhere from 5 to 15 degrees different than the master bedroom. the doors didn't line up right with the door jambs and the windows are single pane.  talk about a giant electric bill!  the year i lived downstairs was a nightmare from start to finish. i LOVED my unit, 2 bed, 2 bath 960 sq ft for about $800 all said and done. however, the first month a washer line broke and flooded my apartment. i asked maintenance when the last time they were replaced was and the man replied, "we don't keep track of minor things like that". uh, ok. i have a $6000 dry cleaning bill that says this is not minor! thankfully i had renter's insurance and that was covered. i did get a brand new washer and dryer for my unit, though.  the downstairs units are horrid for one major reason. if anyone above you is more than 75 pounds, you're going to hear every step they take. i mean EVERY step. you may be so lucky as to hear their morning "business" and them taking a shower. oh and my favorite, i could hear the chairs/bed creaking every time they sat/laid down or got up.  i could be laying in my bed and watch my ceiling DIP and the ceiling fan MOVE (when it was not on) when these tenants walked/stomped across their floor.  upon moving out, i was charged $250 for carpet replacement due to "heavy pet staining". i was livid. i called the manager and told her that the only stains on that carpet were from 2 soda spills and one spaghetti mishap. the contracted carpet company will probably try to replace every time a tenant moves out. bad business! most of the office staff is...ok. the one saving grace this property has is the manager, Erica. she is very, very nice and helpful. she helped me work out the erroneous charge for the carpet and i did get my entire (giant) security deposit back.  if you're planning on moving here, get an east facing upstairs unit, because you'll hate life and your electric bill otherwise.

compass, you get one star based on your employees, not banking practices.  this location is SO slow. i have sat in the drive through for 15 minutes, multiple times. and i'm the only one there! you have to go through the bank parking lot to get to the drive through and i'm always one of less than 3 cars. and i always have to wait. i thought drive through banking was supposed to be more expedient. it's not like i'm making complicated transactions, i'm either depositing a check or cashing one. not rocket science! how are these dimwits employed when smart people can't find work?????

YES! i love this trader joe's! they always have what i want and it's easy to find. if they move something, i can ask someone who works there and they're actually nice about showing me its new locale.  love the tea tree tingle line and many other things about trader joe's. going to this trader joe's is one of the highlights of my week. the checkers are very efficient and usually very friendly as well.

i liked the food, it was a nice diversion from "chain" mexican restaurants, which are quite frankly NOT my favorite, but thanks for playing. shredded beef taco and bean/cheese burro. LOVED the tortilla, nice and chewy, not all chalky and almost crunchy like some. Matthew got a chicken taco that he said was good. the chips and salsa were also quite tasty.  however. it's dark in there. like hard to see the menu kind of dark. it's also COLD, i bring a hoodie everywhere and that usually solves my delicate flower tendencies. not here, still cold with my hoodie.  i really want to give this place 4 or 5 stars, i really do. but the service was just not that caliber. the service was awful. asked 2 separate times for more chips and got them at almost the end of our meal. my drink sat empty for 10 minutes. the servers were nice, but they got my order wrong and put the tacos on the wrong plates.  now, to be fair, there was a "party", looked like some corporate event or something. but, they were attentive to the other tables that had been seated and not us. it may be that i attract bad service at mexican food places, i hope that's not the case!  anyhow, i will patronize this restaurant again for TAKE OUT!

i've been here twice and both times was extremely happy. the servers are very friendly and prompt and the atmosphere is nice and quiet. i've not seen it busy either time, and we went around dinner time.  i usually get beef with basil, green onions and white onions. i've gotten it medium both times, it's delicious. not very spicy and just the right amount of flavor.  Matthew usually gets the thai fried rice with tofu and just loves it. we've tried some appetizers; the chicken satay and the spring rolls. the sauce that comes with the satay is wonderfully peanut-y and spicy.  not too expensive, highly recommend.

I really like pei wei, even if they do have teeny-boppers manning the registers that overuse "like" and "um, ok".  I usually get the edamame and salad rolls, this is branching out for me.  my old favorite was the pad thai, no tofu, extra beef, extra spicy; with a side of crab puffs.  i am also a HUGE fan of their hot mustard.  service is usually expedient. it's not a big restaurant and can get a bit crowded.

no. not ever. never never never never again.   i remember elephant bar when it was adjacent to chris town mall (!) and i remember liking it, but i was 12 so that may not be totally accurate.  anyhow, i've never left a restaurant with absolutely nothing good to say about it. until now. it was awful. i'm sorry, except for the calamari appetizer, which for some reason i liked. it was 95% awful.  i ordered some "shrimp adventure/shrimp ahoy/shrimp bonanza" sort of thing, because i hadn't had shrimp in awhile and it sounded tasty. horrendous. of the 3 types, only 1 was mediocre, the butterflied fried kind.  the grilled ones were still GRAY and cold. the "shrimp on a stick", which i think was coconut prawns, were stingy and over-fried, not to mention they left the tail on. mmmmm crunchy.  now, i did tell my server about the undone shrimp and he was apologetic and asked me what i'd like to replace it. i said fried shrimp, which took 25 minutes to get there. the manager came over and apologized, offering us a free dessert. we went for it. we shouldn't have. it was apple-blueberry cobbler with walnut streusel. it tasted like unevenly cooked, gooey potpourri...or at least what i imagine that tastes like.   in the end, we did have a very good and prompt server, so he got a nice tip. it's not his fault the kitchen staff can't find their rear with both hands.

ok. i love macayo's, i always have. the food is pretty darn consistent and when i'm going to a chain restaurant, that is what i expect and actually what i want. as per usual, the food was exactly what i had anticipated.  i would have loved to give a 4 or 5 star review on the food, but that's not what this review is really about. THIS is a service review.   Matthew and i went to dinner with my parents last night (Sunday) around 645 and Paul was our server. now, i don't know if he was new or one of those older, jaded servers who think they know everything. sometimes they're hard to tell apart. this guy seemed like he didn't want us or anyone else to be there, like he had better things to be doing than his JOB. if you don't like people, DO NOT BE A SERVER. seriously.  had to ask for refills two separate times after near empty drinks (1" left in glass) sat for 10 minutes, had to ask for more chips twice, and he dropped Matthew's plate on the way out of the kitchen and said "did you hear that crash? that was your taco, they're making you another one." which took another 10 minutes. oh and my favorite...my dad ordered shrimp fajitas.  the food comes (minus Matthew's) and what kind of fajitas do we receive? beef. i said to my dad, "didn't you order SHRIMP fajitas?" he replied that he did in fact do so and stated such to the server. Paul said that was incorrect, that he wrote down beef. my dad said that wasn't what he ordered and that he would indeed like shrimp. so i don't know how you get beef from shrimp, or even steak from shrimp. yes, they're all monosyllabic. but they've got differing vowel sounds and one of those words starts with a different letter even!  he was totally rude and when i go back (it's inevitable, i like their generic food occasionally) i will specifically request to not sit in Paul's section.

i've never actually been inside little chicago, but i order from there often when i'm at work.  their delivery is prompt and usually friendly. there are a couple drivers that are kind of blah, but i guess it comes with the territory. they are FAST though, except the pizza obviously...it has to be baked.  i usually get the italian cold cuts sandiwch and it's by far one of my favorite sandwiches on the planet. nice and meaty, not too much lettuce and their sub dressing is just super duper. i finally got the pizza and it was cut square! i loved it even before i took a bite just for that. i'm really glad i didn't marvel too long at the lovely 90 degree angles of my lunch because that pizza is ridiculously tasty. i want to eat it all the time. but i don't think i could shove that AND that yummy sandwich in my mouth at the same time. well, i probably could, but it wouldn't be pretty.  if you haven't been or ordered from this place, do so. it's worth it.

if there was more seating and less people taking up space with their laptops and drinks, this would be 5 stars.  i love this place. love it.  i always get the ham and swiss with a caesar, aka the "wildflower two".  you can pick whatever you want from a list, but that's mine.  the sandwich has this wonderfully sticky, spicy and sweet honey mustard sauce on it, the swiss is plentiful but not overpowering as swiss can be, and the ham is piled high and it's not bland ham either. the bread. the bread is fantastic. i'm not usually a rye person, but this is really good. it's pasilla chili rye so it's got a very tiny hint of spice.   the last time i went, i took my mom and she got the seasonal haddock sandwich...it too was utterly fantastic.  needless to say, Matthew and i go here about every 2 weeks. we know it will always be tasty and prompt. what we don't know is if there will be any seating!

Was in a few weeks ago and had the white bean chicken chili. superfantasticdeliciousness.  i've only had one meal out of about 20 here that i didn't like.  Wildflower is one of our favorite afternoon places to grab a bite. Thanks, Louis!

CPC, you would have gotten FIVE stars if your service didn't suck butt.  this review has been a long time coming, as i am fairly lazy.  i dislike waiting. a great deal. i do however understand that sometimes it's necessary. i expected some wait time at this place, due to the nature of the beast. i did not expect rude and ridiculously slow service, as in we sat for 20 minutes for a refill and they were not busy. this was after we'd sat there for 15 minutes waiting for girl to take our order, not busy at that time either. after we ate, she was ever so prompt in bringing the check, but we waited another 15 minutes for her to pick it up!  we were there for 1.5 hours, which is just too long for me. and no fault to the decor (which is very interesting, church pews and glassed-in doors for tables) but you're uncomfortable with no padding.  i'll eat here again, but only if someone goes and picks it up for me. i'd rather not go in again after that kind of service. my pasty was delicious, the fries were...not my favorite kind, but that's ok.

after our first horrible experience, i had vowed never to go back.  i'm so glad i gave it another chance!  this time we went when it was busy, and sat at the bar.  the bartender/server was so helpful and attentive, completely knew how to treat customers.  the tomato soup was incredible and i have since recommended CPC to many of my friends. thanks dean!

i just started a new job that orders from here fairly frequently, so i decided to try it one day.  i ordered the chicken caesar wrap and a diet coke.  i don't know how you can screw those things up, but that's what happened. i'll probably give it another shot, but i will definitely order something different!

soooooooooo glad i gave it another shot.  i LOVE roast beef sandwiches. especially roast beef sandwiches that are RARE and have a lot of meat on them!!!!!!  the cheddar cheese is really good, the horseradish mayo could be spicier...but the sub roll it comes on is delicious and didn't fall apart. i hate it when that happens. the stormin norman (minus tomatoes and peppers) is absolutely fantastic and i want to eat it every single day. for the rest of my life.

another disappointing visit to smashburger. i got the avocado chicken club, crispy with no tomato. it comes to the table, GRILLED. also the order of smashfries was incredibly skimpy. i actually mentioned it and received more, so kudos there i guess. i ordered a side of petal sauce which took 10 minutes, was told they were making a new batch...found that pretty weird. isn't that what a.m. prep does?  the chicken sandwich was something comparable to mcdonald's or wendy's and around the same price. not impressed.  i was so excited about this smashburger opening and it has done nothing but disappoint me.  i think maybe i'll go back to the other tempe location and see if it's still good because i'm not going back to this one for a looooooooong time.

this place used to be a jack in the box and it's kind of obvious. however, the dining room is nice and clean, if a little dim; the service is prompt but shy; and they bring you WONTON chips (notice aforementioned wonton/deep-fried love) with your drinks!  i ordered the noodle soup with beef and rice noodles. it was some of the best soup i have ever had. the rice noodles were delicate and delicious, and the beef was tender and plentiful. the flavor was so amazing that i find it hard to describe. Matthew got the mandalay stir fry with pork and it too was delicious. honestly, i was more involved with my soup than his noodles, but i'll try more of it next time.  the server, while friendly, was very shy and you could tell he was nervous. but, he was very efficient and that's what really matters.  i really hope this place makes it, i *think* it's family owned and i always like to see that. if you get the chance, head over and get some noodle soup! i hope your experience is as good as mine was:)

we can't stay away from this place!  just got home from a delightful lunch. again, i ordered the beef noodle soup, just as delicious as the first time! Matthew got the chicken fried rice (fanTASTIC) with an eggroll. i hate eggrolls generally and i would order 3 of them! so good, you can tell fresh ingredients are used and we were actually told by our server that they don't even make it until it's ordered. i like that. i like that A LOT.  we had the same server as before, i need to get his name because he is just awesome. he remembered us AND what we ordered, and seemed much more confident today, that made us happy too.  there were 5 tables seated when we got there, so at least people are going in and trying this place.  i hope they tell all of their friends, because this restaurant NEEDS to stick around!  oh, and both times our bill with drinks was under $25.00 WITH tip (a good tip, not a stingy one), another thing that's awesome about this place.
