Now THIS is ramen! I even ordered it for take out and could tell with my first slurp that it was everything I'd been looking for. Complex broth, yummy noodles, all the right toppings...the only thing I would have changed is the pork, which was tough and chewy and not melt-in-your mouth delicious. I'd definitely try again while dining in to see if the quality I'd the pork improved. The rest of the ramen was so tasty it didn't matter!   Also, for take out the service was super quick and friendly. The prices are great, too! I got the ramen lunch special which came with a California roll that was incredibly tasty and fresh, and it came out to under ten bucks for a lot of food!

I love this place for what it is-a place to get cheap fabric and other assorted craft/sewing supplies. I know going in here that it isn't going to be clean, or quick, or easy to sort through the piles of material.   When I shop for fabric, I'm only looking for knits (I make scarves out of super soft knits), which are located on the righthand side of the store near the back in a GIANT pile that is only haphazardly organized. Knits aren't sold in large quantities like most of the other fabric they have-they are mostly just small-ish pieces that almost all have holes or stains. You have to check the fabric yourself, because they won't do it for you when you go to have it measured.   I'd say on average, most knits are between 1/2 yard to 3 yards in length that are in the pile of fabrics. The exception is the bins next to the knit piles, which typically have much smaller pieces of material and are usually irregularly shaped. I have found some great, super soft knits in these piles-think fabric that is used by James Perse, Ella Moss, Splendid...that's what these feel like. It requires a lot of digging to find usable amounts of material in the piles that are also hole- and stain-free, but it's worth it! Knits are only $1.99 a yard here, which is a phenomenal deal.  They sell other fabrics that would be used for costumes, tons of sparkly fabrics, plus fleece, upholstery fabrics (though they don't sell upholstery thread), and a bunch of threads in different levels of quality/quantity. They do sell needles but they are behind the register, and you order them by telling them which number you want from the "menu" of smallish items.   BEFORE YOU PAY AT THE REGISTER, you MUST have your fabric measured at one of the cutting stations-even if you don't plan to have the material cut! They measure it to figure out how much you are getting, then they make you a receipt and hold your material behind the register. When you are ready to pay, simply walk up with your receipt to the register and they'll calculate the total from your receipt and bring you your bag of fabric. They take most credit cards so I don't need to have cash here (it seems like the type of place where it would be cash-only, but thankfully it is not).  Come here if you are prepared to spend time and effort finding the best and cheapest material around without all the glitz and glamour of a regular (i.e. chain) fabric store!

Ate here for lunch last weekend for the first time in over 8 years. I was happy to see that not much had changed, and the sushi was as delicious as ever! I was, however, disappointed in the available sushi lunch specials--I was so spoiled in NYC with all of the cheap sushi lunch spots everywhere!   The lunch menu here is seriously lacking in sushi, so I opted for a bento box which was huge (and cost about $13). I liked just about everything involved, and you get choices for each section of the box. You do get sushi with the bento box, but the selection is limited-either one roll (I got the spicy tuna, which actually had a lot more to it than just tuna-yum!) or two pieces of nigiri.   I also got teriyaki chicken, which was good but did not come with any rice...that was a bit unexpected, but because there's so much food in the bento box I didn't miss it. My friend ordered a side of it to go with hers and I don't think they charged us for it. For the "salad" option you can choose from sumunomo (probably butchered the spelling on that), turkey salad (sounds random but is actually really good), or seaweed salad (which I ordered). Seaweed was fresh and tasty, and the portion was definitely decent.  You can choose between shumai (shrimp dumplings), gyoza (pork dumplings) or something else that sounded calorie-bombish (I wanna say it was fried cheese? I didn't order it either way). My friend and I were steering clear of fried food so we got the shumai, which ended up being quite fried indeed! I haven't ever seen fried shumai, but I tried a small bite and it was decent but greasy.   I was glad that the small amount of sushi I had with lunch was as tasty and fresh as ever-I will definitely be back for more!

I seriously can't believe I haven't ever written a review of my favorite Mexican place in the entire world! Not like this place is still a secret, which is a good thing because hopefully that means it's not going anywhere.   I should mention that I can't normally eat a lot of food in one sitting. But something magical happens to my stomach when I walk into Carolina's. I'm suddenly able to put away twice the amount of food as my male dining companions. The problem is, I can't ever decide whether to get the bean and cheese burrito or the red machaca burrito, so I just end up getting both. And finishing both. And it's not even difficult!   These have to be two of the best burritos in the history of the world, and I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the ridiculously delicious tortillas they make here. I always pick up a dozen to take back with me to NYC, just to show people here that good Mexican DOES exist! It's just all, sadly, located in slightly shady parts of Phoenix (or in SoCal, or in actual Mexico).   The wait to order is never very long, but the wait to get your food does seem endless. It's only because they make everything fresh to order, though! And it probably just feels like an eternity because I've really been waiting several MONTHS to eat this food, and that's just added to the 5-10 minute wait for the food to arrive.   They have something here that I have never seen before...a Coke fountain AND a Pepsi fountain! And a smaller fountain with ok-tasting horchata and other Mexican refrescas. So no more fighting over whether a place is Coke or Pepsi, they've got it all covered.   I could probably write several essays' worth of love for this place, but I'll save you all the time-just get off your butt and get to Carolina's ASAP! And if you're heading to NYC, bring me some tortillas! :)

This is a place I miss terribly ever since I moved away. I go at least three times during my week-long vacays back to Scottsdale, and I always order the exact same thing: Pablo Picasso salad, hold the cilantro, and a Pizzookie (chocolate chip, of course).   I've tried the pizza, the sandwiches, all of the apps, but these are the only two things that have me coming back. The dressing on the Picasso salad tastes like a delicious Mexican party in your mouth, and the salad itself has so many wonderful ingredients, including a very delicious, slightly spicy fajita chicken. There are FOUR different kinds of cheeses in here, and tomatoes, and chips. I. Love. This. Salad.  HOWEVER, I love pretty much nothing more in this universe (sorry, bf!) than the amazingness that is the pizzookie. I often dream about it, and wish I could replicate it in my own kitchen. Even other restaurants fail at making this dish perfect (I'm looking at you, BJ's and Boulders!). Oregano's excels and makes you want to eat this every day. I can never finish a whole one (and when I do, I feel sick but in the most satisfying way), so I usually share. I get pretty greedy and territorial, though, so watch out.  The service here is always very friendly and nice, and many of the male servers are very attractive (that's a nice bonus!). Prices are definitely on the cheaper side, and they have some new-ish options of making your salad a 'Junior' size for a few bucks less, and it's STILL a ton of food.  Bottom line, you have to try the Pizzookie. You may hate me later for the weight I made you gain from becoming addicted, but during those orgasmic moments when the warm, melty cookie is in your mouth, you'll be thanking me.

This place fails. Just totally fails. I was forced to eat here one night even though all I wanted was a delicious burrito from one of the -erto's, Betos, or Fiesta Burrito. But no, I was coerced into coming here because they're "open late" and my friend swore up down and backwards that it was "amazing". I really should have known better because her favorite Mexican place is Arriba-really?! I feel bad for her, because there's so much great Mexican food in this town!   OK, so they decided to extend their hours, but you know what? THEY CUT THEIR MENU TO FIVE ITEMS AFTER 1 AM! Not cool.   Pro: The golf cart that drove us here from Dos Gringos...apparently it's a club shuttle, but has "Julio's Too" written all over it, and the guy driving it said he's work for them for 10 years and that the owner of the golf shuttle also owns Julio's Too. This driver claimed everything here was "delicious" but couldn't be specific about any item. Hmmmm, I wonder if that's because...  Con: THE FOOD SUCKED. It was just plain bad. I mean, I eat from some grimy burrito places, and their food is AMAZING compared to the stuff they're passing off as food here. Maybe it's because we went late, but either way I decided to play it safe and order a bean and cheese burrito that I could barely eat five bites of before completely giving up on it. Others in my party ordered the carne asada burrito (oh, I should mention that I was the only sober one here-everyone in my party was absolutely sloshed), and most of them ate all of it, but later told me how bad it was and what a bad idea it was to eat it. They said they would have much rather gone to a good place (which I agreed with!), and collectively we all agreed never to come here again.   Next time you see the Julio's Too shuttle driver pass by, ask him for a ride to the nearest GOOD Mexican place! Or even the philly cheesesteak place near the bars which is decent. Just stay away from this place.

Ok...if this place was in NYC, I would literally walk MILES to get to it every single day. It's THAT good. I'm not even anywhere near Lux when I do stay in Phx, but I make the 20-something mile drive out there just to enjoy their iced lattes.   The prices are right in line with what I'm used to in NYC, but I suppose some in AZ might get sticker shock. It's SOOO worth the price though! I always order their iced soy latte with just half a packet of sweet n low, with whipped cream on top ($4.25), and HOLY CRAP, best thing ever. No idea how they do it.   The whipped cream here is prooooobably the best thing I've ever tasted, like, ever. I can't rave about it enough. But when you put it on top of a perfectly sweetened, creamy, icy, doesn't-even-really-taste-like-coffee beverage, it's heaven.   I asked the staff how they make their espresso so damn good, and they said they don't do anything different; they say it's most likely the roasting machines that have been "seasoned" with so much use that makes it so good.   Also-pastries are great, never had a bad one. The cookies are soft and chewy and yummy! Love the vibe of this place too, very loungy and laid back, with lots of people working on their laptops.   i almost always combine a trip here with one to Pane Bianco, and you're allowed to eat your sandwich inside Lux which is awesome. I'm not sure if they force you to buy something from them to eat in there, but I can't resist either way and always end up buying something anyway.   If you live anywhere NEAR Lux, you need to get your butt over there and try their whipped cream and espresso ASAP!

The espresso is SO smooth! I ordered the iced soy latte to give it a try and it didn't need anything added to it-it was perfect. I liked it so much I went back the next day, even though it's totally out of my way, just because it was that good! The baristas are also really friendly, which seems rare nowadays. They had live music playing when I was there on Sunday, which was cool. Prices are solid, I think it was either 4.25 or 4.75 for my soy latte, which is definitely fair for how deliciously amazing it was. I will definitely be back!

Note: Review is JUST for the happy hour!  I can't believe how cheap the food on the happy hour menu is-$3 for a regular sized burger? And it comes with sweet potato fries? While the fries weren't very abundant, they were tasty, as was the burger.   The calamari was perfect-light and crisp and not greasy at all, but the portion was tiiiiiny. I mean, it was only a couple bucks, so what can you expect? But it was great even if it was small.   Crispy chicken skewers were basically chicken nuggets served with a sweet/spicy sauce, and they were juicy and yummy.  Cucumber salad was alright, nothing to write home about, but a nice light dish to add to the mix of heavier ones.   My drink was the highlight of the evening, though it was at least twice the price of every food item ordered combined. I couldn't find a drink that stood out to me on the extensive cocktail list, but when I flipped to the back page I noticed their nonalcoholic beverages, one of which caught my eye. It had strawberries, mango, and coconut cream. I asked if I could add rum to it, and they said no problem. When I got the bill, it was $13-the price of drinks where I live, NYC. The price would really not be an issue if every single other drink on the entire drink menu didn't go above $10. I get that you have to ring in the drink I ordered, then "add rum", but I thought it was silly to charge that much when it had just as much alcohol and fruit as other beverages on the menu.   It should be noted that while happy hour pricing applies to food, it DOES NOT APPLY TO DRINKS! There are like two drinks that are available under the happy hour umbrella, and the happy hour drink menu makes it appear that there are more. Two people in my party ordered specific beers because they were listed at $3, but when the bill came they were more. Read the fine print, just as a heads up!  The atmosphere was fun, and there aren't too many tiki-style places around these parts, so points for originality. Our server was a little distracted and seemed to want to be elsewhere, but the host JK was incredibly welcoming and kind. I would consider going back again for happy hour food, and maybe one drink, but more than that is out of my budget!

Kitchen sink salad is amazing! It comes with chewy, soft bagel "chips" on the side and the salad itself is a pretty decent portion of yummy quinoa, lettuce (arugula?), and lots of other goodies. You won't get bored with this salad, that's for sure. This salad has bagel chips in it, which I was skeptical of at first, but they came in a separate bag and were soft and chewy, just like a bagel should be!  I've tried a few bites of other items like the breakfast burrito and the club, both of which were tasty. I've been wanting to try the burgers since they sound so delicious, but they're always out of them, even before noon!   As for drinks, I've tried the soy chai, almond chai, and dirty soy chai. I've gotta say, don't mess with perfection-the soy chai is where it's at! Also, their lemonade is BOMB, and I hate lemonade usually. The girl behind the counter said it's not homemade but it's "really expensive" lemonade they get delivered, and I totally believe her.  Only complaints are the hours (they close so early!) and the parking situation, which totally sucks. Parking requires Austin-Powers style maneuvers going from reverse to drive back and forth, but its totally worth it. Part of this is because they have a DRIVE-THRU, which is awesome, but the line is sooooooo long (all the time!), so it's worth it to just park and go inside or order if you don't call ahead. Also, you can call ahead and go through the drive-thru to pick up your order if there's no line!  Overall, cheap and delicious but lame hours and parking situation!

Jen is amazing! She is truly an artist with nails (fingers and toes-but especially toes!). I've been seeing her for 14 years, and her skill has only evolved with time. She is so creative and knows what will look awesome-just trust her. She'll suggest colors and patterns for you if you don't know what you want, and if you have a crazy idea she can probably do it. And she's great at incorporating rhinestones into stuff!!  I am so loyal to her nail art that even though I live in NYC, land of the man/pedi combos, I almost never get my nails done here because I'd rather wait the six months until I make my semi-annual visit home to AZ. Her toenail paintings seem to last forever! Some of my favorites are watermelons (great for summer!), American Flag (complete with rhinestones, a 4th of July fave), zebra stripes, tuxedos (SO cute for formal events! and she does whatever color combo you want), and team spirit/school colors (she even begrudgingly painted my toes with U of A spirit despite her ASU allegiance!).   I'm attaching a few pics of toenail art I've had done here to show just what a fabulous job Jen does. She also has a facebook page for her work (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Happy-Feet-by-Jen-at-Carolynes-Salon/133142156725918) where you can see other nail art she's done.  I realize this sounds like a paid promotion for her, but honestly, Jen is just amazing. She's so easy to talk to, and so fun! I dare you to see her and NOT like her. Just try! Everyone I've referred to her over the years has nothing but raves for her.   As for other services at Carolyne's, I've had my hair done by Liz and she's pretty good. I have friends who have seen other stylists there (whose names I can't remember off the top of my head) that they love, and the place is pretty big and spacious, so there are plenty of stylists to choose from!  With regards to the comments on the front desk people, I understand...but we're in Scottsdale. Come on. The owner and her daughter have always been nice to me and my fam, possibly because we've been there with them for so long, but I've seen the way they act around other people and it's not anything out of the ordinary for this town. It's definitely not the worst I've seen, but just suck it up-you're in a salon in the land of pretentiousness. You'll walk out of there as gorgeous as the rest of the city and you'll forget the front desk people five minutes later anyway.   Moral of the story: GO SEE JEN!!!!

This review is specifically for the Saturday BBQ's that Hobe has. They have them every Saturday, from 11am-4pm, and for only $5 you get a TON of delicious food! I used to come on Saturdays for lunch 3 years ago and they still have the same exact deal now, only with more options!  You get a choice of a meat (burger, ribs, tri tip sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, chicken sandwich, 50/50 bacon burger, plus a few other things), and a side (baked beans, fries, I think you can even get a twice baked potato!), AND a drink! You can even split the sides and do half beans and half fries like my bf enjoys doing.   You pick out your drink from a cooler behind where you stand to place your order, near the front door (also near the utensils and sauces). They have diet and regular sodas, nothing too exciting, but they also have water bottles. They have a few tables outside where you can sit, and they're all in the shade. The tables are much nicer than they were a few years ago, but that is about the only difference I've noticed since I started coming here again (I moved away for 3 years but have returned!).   This is seriously the best deal in town, or possibly in the whole world. Five bucks gets you a generous portion of meat cooked to order (so be prepared to wait a bit, but it doesn't take TOO long) AND a side AND a drink. Why are there not more reviews of this place? This deal has been going on for YEARS and the price hasn't even gone up-maybe I am giving the secret away? If that's the case, I am glad to share this secret because it's too delicious and cheap to keep it to myself.   P.S. Buy a bottle of the bacon bbq sauce. It goes on EVERYTHING!

Iced chocolate chai with almond milk and boba...YUM!!!! I've had the thai iced tea with soymilk and bubbles as well, but it pales in comparison to the chocolate chai. The prices are up there, but they have a deal where if you sign up to get their text message updates, you can get a free drink!   The boba/bubbles here are some of the best I've had in town (though that is not saying much), they're chewy and soft and plump and sweet, and they'll add them to any drink so you can get pretty creative! They have a bunch of options for tea, and the baked goods are actually pretty decent (the cupcakes are moist and yummy!). Anytime I'm in the area I end up here, if only for that almond milk chocolate chai...it is SO good! Slightly spicy and sweet, it's a taste I crave. Also-love the plethora of non dairy options!

They've got $5 ketel one on the rocks. It's walking/stumbling distance from my apartment. It might be the least pretentious bar in the Old Town vicinity. The only downside is you can really smell the cigarette smoke wafting in from the patio (and lingering on what seems to be most of the patrons here, who btw have an average age of 50), and I can't stand the smell of it. You get used to it after a while, and tend to forget about it after a few of the super cheap drinks. Well vodka drinks are only $3! On a Saturday night! I could get used to this...  Oh, and the bartenders are chill and awesome. I will be back!

This is great, inexpensive (especially considering the quality) spot for lunch or brunch. Bf and I had Sunday brunch here this past week and really enjoyed it, despite a few annoyances along the way.   One thing I will just never understand is how a restaurant in Arizona will serve unfiltered tap water. I guess I'm just spoiled from living in NYC the past 3 years, where the tap water is delicious, but either way, the ice water was basically not drinkable. Good thing the brunch item I ordered (French country breakfast) came with free coffee! Bonus points for having soy milk available. Coffee was actually way above average for drip coffee.   When we ordered our food, we both wanted croissants instead of the baguette that was supposed to come with our meals, which it says on the menu is an option. The waitress informed us that the croissants were in the process of baking and it would be  a bit longer than usual for our food to be ready if we wanted croissants. That would be fine with us, we said. Sadly, she came back about 10 minutes later to let us know the croissants burned, so we wouldn't be getting any :( She was really nice about it though, and after trying the baguette/whatever kind of crusty white bread it is they serve, I forgot all about the croissant that could have been.  Bf ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was not advertised as coming with sides, but it indeed came with hash browns AND a side salad, and was half the price of my meal (it was only around $6!). Mine included pretty much everything his did, just deconstructed-bacon, eggs, hash browns, bread, but with jam and without a salad. Those were basically the only differences. Mine also came with coffee (though oj was stated on the menu as being available, I just didn't ask for it), but I certainly don't think that was worth the extra six bucks when I could get all I wanted for half the price in the bfast sandwich!  The one thing that reallyyyyy bothered me about my meal, though, was that there was ROSEMARY on everything-on the hash browns and on the eggs (which were stacked on top of one another). This would have been ok if it was stated on the menu, but rosemary is nowhere to be found in any description I read. It was also all over bf's food, but he likes it, so he didn't care. I have a serious aversion to it after an unfortunate food poisoning incident a few years ago, and noticed it immediately when my plate was set in front of me. I would have picked around it, but it was seriously everywhere.   The waitress was incredibly nice about it and didn't really press for questions about why I couldn't eat it, but swiftly took it away and said I would have a fresh, non-rosemary version of my breakfast shortly. I really appreciated that, a lot. A chef brought out my rosemary-free food just a few minutes later, and as a bonus, they gave me a croissant!!! They had just come out of the oven and I really liked that they remembered I'd tried to order it with that, and it was delicious.  Overall, great service and inexpensive food in a lovely atmosphere! I would definitely recommend this place and I can't wait to go back to try all of the yummy things in that pastry case of theirs.

I was missing my old neighborhood in Queens (shout out to Astoria!) as I sometimes do, and found myself craving a Greek salad. Not just an ordinary Greek salad, but one piled high with fresh produce and charcoal grilled juicy chicken breast. I knew it would be a task to find one near my Old Town apartment, but one day BF had a gyro craving and off we went.   After referencing Yelp, we had narrowed it down to George's Gyros and George's Famous Gyros (I'm in front of Ray's pizza! Famous Ray's? No, just original Jerry!). We actually decided on the non-famous George's, but they were closed on Sunday so our decision was made for us. I'm so glad we ended up here, though-it was delicious!   We ordered take-out and placed our order at the counter, so we waited about 10-15 minutes which ended up being just enough time to scope out the staff (who have fun with their job which I love!) and the location (with the office door marked "Pirate"). We also enjoyed the soda fountain-this is a Coca Cola establishment, hooray! And they have a good syrup-to-soda-water ration which is hard to find. Now, on to the food...  BF's gyro was GINORMOUS and stuffed to the brim with tasty gyro meat. He gave me a bite (so generous!) and it melted in my mouth. He conquered half of it before saving the rest for later, which he said was just as good cold. The fries that came with it were good, but I will warn you that they gave us Hunt's ketchup packets, so make sure you have your own ketchup at hand if you are like me and have an aversion to Hunt's.   My Greek salad was even bigger than the sandwich-TONS of grilled, moist, juicy chicken on top of a *big* salad. And they accommodated my request for no peppers or olives (which, yes, I know, makes it not a "Greek" salad but whateva) which was really cool. There was an abundance of fresh lettuce and veggies, and it was more than enough for two meals. It came with two containers of an oil and vinegar dressing, and hit the spot JUST like my fave Astoria haunts. And it came with garlic bread! Super buttery and crispy and plain delicious.   Oh! And the kicker was that both meals came to under $20 including tip, PLUS we got two drinks for free since we checked in with Yelp. I will be back for sure!

I had gone to a different cobbler near PV mall a few days ago to check out how much it would cost to repair a broken handle on a nice leather handbag and a missing piece of a buckle on a pair of shoes.   The other place made me feel like they were doing me a favor by being there and quoted me prices that, while not outrageous, were definitely high and the work they said they'd need to do on them seemed way more intricate than it needed to be (they told me I had to special order some piece and that they'd have to replace BOTH buckles entirely even though only one small piece of one buckle was missing). They told me it would be about a week to have those both fixed. I had decided to give up on having either item fixed when I found Tony's.  It was like a breath of fresh air (well, leathery air) walking into Tony's spacious shop. The seating area is open and big, and Tony is right there behind the counter. I showed him both items and he told me what he'd need to do to fix them. Both jobs seemed MUCH simpler than the first place had made them out to be, AND the prices at Tony's were less than half that of the other place. It was $22 total to fix the piece on my bag and replace the missing piece of the shoe buckle and they were ready not even 24 hours later!   The only downside (if there is one) is that they close at 5:30pm, which makes it tough to get there after work. I will most definitely be bringing in any broken bags or shoes here in the future because it's cheap, fast, and friendly!  P.S. It's ****CASH ONLY****.

5 stars just for making me feel like I was nowhere near Scottsdale...or any town, for that matter! It felt like I had left the city completely, when really I wasn't even 5 minutes from my apartment in Old Town. I was at a loss as to how to find this place, when all I knew was that it was at Thomas and the 101. But where?   Head East on Thomas, go OVER the 101, and it will be on the North side of the street (lefthand side). I made the mistake of driving just past it and ended up parking near the compost area, but there are signs indicating where to to turn-it's basically right after the freeway. You can park at the second turn like I did, and I can definitely recommend doing that as I got to enjoy a wonderful walk through the farm grounds...it is simply GORGEOUS!  I immediately heard rooster crows, and saw the rooster cage on my left as I started walking through this oasis in the middle of the desert. There are rows of various veggies growing in the ground, and the whole place is just wayyy more expansive than I could have ever imagined. I just want to come here and sit. It's that beautiful, and that different than any other space I've seen anywhere near here!  As for the Farmer's Markets, they take place on Saturday mornings from 9am-2pm. They post the info for the upcoming week's market on their Facebook and list some of the items they will be selling at the market that week. The actual market is in and around a small house-looking structure, and has the type of stuff you'd see at most farmer's markets-greens (spinach, kale, arugula, beets), fruits (mostly oranges this time of year), veggies (mostly of the root variety this time of year), spices, raw local honey, and bread.   They were sadly out of almost all bread by the time I arrived (around noon), and they said that this week was way busier than anticipated and that they're going to order more for next week. They also have a truck with fresh-squeezed juices, and a stand with cooked items like soup and bruschetta. I didn't get to try any of these, but they looked yummy!  There are also a few fire pits throughout the grounds, which make for a lovely place to sit and enjoy some of your freshly-purchased goods. Also, something really awesome about them is they take credit cards!!!! And everyone I encountered that works there is very friendly, which I appreciated. And not fake nice, like the people who work the McClendon's stand at the Old Town farmer's market, but genuinely nice people who care about the products.   Prices were definitely fair for organic produce-I paid $3 for about the equivalent of a salad-in-a-bag amount of spinach, and $8 for a half-pint of raw local honey. I can't wait to come back next week...this place is worth waking up early on the weekend for!

Update: YOU MUST TRY THE PRESSED JUICES!!!!!! Apple kale & carrot apple habanero ($7 each) are the most amazing juices I have had in Arizona. They use a Norwalk press, so the nutrients are all in tact, and the juice are the tastiest, most delicious, fresh beverages I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. I want these to be available every day and not just on Farmer's Market days!!!

They don't have soymilk. Or any non-dairy options for coffee. But...isn't this a breakfast/MORNING ONLY restaurant? And aren't we in North Scottsdale? Just checking.   They do have a coffee on the menu that sounds delicious, but is of course "already made" and they can't serve it without the condensed milk. I would have totally ordered it and went without milk if it meant I could partake in the yummy-sounding cardamom and cinnamon infusion, but alas, they said it was already all pre-made.   Anyway, we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table in a space that seems like it could easily fit ten more tables in there (I only walked in the first room, not the second one), so it just felt oddly empty. Service was nice, everyone was friendly, food didn't take too long, and the food was pretty good.  I ordered an egg white omelet with spinach, asparagus, and mushrooms, with a side of sweet potato tots. The tots were alright, but not nearly as delicious as I'd hoped. Something about them was off. Omelet was fresh and tasty, but swimming in butter/oil (order it dry if you're watching your calories!).  My friend and I split a 1/2 order of the caramelized banana and pecan french toast. I have to give the restaurant credit for offering half orders of ANYTHING, but especially for something so heavy and delicious sounding. Don't you hate going to brunch and having to decide between being healthy or a total glutton? I only ended up eating a few bits of the cloyingly sweet french toast, which wasn't the worst I've had but I certainly wouldn't order it again (and I LOVE sweets).   Also, *they close at 1pm*, and we were still eating at 1:10 and were probably the last people in there-they clear it out by closing time! This is NOT the place for a lazy Sunday morning brunch, unless of course you are a very early riser.  I would only go back to try out their infamous waffle dog, but I need to be up super early and bring my own coffee if I plan to go for brunch one weekend!

This place kept impressing me throughout our meal! From the quick seating time despite arriving at prime time hours on a weekend, to the gracious service even though we were only ordering apps, to the AMAZING food, I'm so glad we stopped by.  I loved this place when it was Fine's Cellar, and I'm glad to see that 5th and Wine stole their menu and concept, because it's just as awesome. Unfortunately, none of us ended up having any wine even though the selection looked amazing, but the food more than made up for that.  I ordered the butternut squash soup to start...and I mean business when I say this is the BEST SOUP I'VE EVER TASTED! (Sorry, Grandma...you know I always loved your matzoh balls, but this is in another league!) The soup was velvety, smooth, rich, and sweet, and even though I burned my tongue after one bite, I could instantly taste how wonderful it was. I have no idea what compelled me to order soup in the first place because it was at least 110 degrees outside, but I am soooo glad I did! I will definitely order this on my next visit!  I also ordered the bruschetta, which comes in two, four, or six increments. I chose four (and kindly shared one with the bf): two "Apples, Brie, Fig Jam, Honey and Agave Drizzle", o ne "Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil, Balsamic Reduction", and one "Smoked Sockeye Salmon, Brie , Eggs, Onion Capers".   The smoked salmon was the weakest, and the sauce that came on it wasn't very tasty, but the deliciousness of the other two bruschetta flavors definitely made up for that! The flavors on the  apple one just melded well together, and there was both red and green apples on it. The balsamic on the other bruschetta was very sweet and yummy, and the tomatoes were clearly very fresh. Would definitely order these two again!   A really nice touch was that each piece of bruschetta (which were very sizeable) was cut into thirds, making eating and sharing very easy.   Bf ordered a strawberry salad that he liked, and our other dining partners loved their bruschetta as well. They  ordered a few different ones than I did, though I can't remember which ones.   The service was impeccable, and the ambiance was very chic and fun, with a live band playing while we ate. It was difficult to hear each other  at times, but it was a lively setting. When our server asked if we were ready for the check, he even offered to split it up  between the two couples. That rarely happens to me-usually we have to request it, and the server will hem and haw and then agree (I've been a server and I would hate it too, so I understand), but I liked that this server took initiative. He even pointed out that if we bring our receipt back in the next two weeks, we get a discount on our meal. That's pretty awesome.  Overall, awesome place, affordable too. I wish they were closer to Scottsdale Road so they would get more foot traffic! But then that would mean I'd have to wait longer when I want to eat there :)

If you're trying to decide on a place for ramen, and you've ever dined at Ippudo, Naruto, Minca, or Totto in NYC and thought they had good to fantastic ramen, you will NOT like Republic.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with pork (you get a choice of meat) and an egg, and a lychee green tea with boba. The ramen was not complex at all, and really just tasted like salt. And the noodles looked and felt and tasted packaged, sooo not worth the calories tasty at all! The pork was tough and chewy and not tender at all, and there were so many fatty bits that were inedible that I wish I had opted for tofu. I liked the spinach, which was out of place but flavorful.  The bubble tea was AWFUL for the first few sips, which alternated between bitter and chemical-sweet, but after I let it sit for 15 minutes it was better. The boba were a little too hard/dry on the inside, but it was towards the end of the day so maybe they were just sitting around for a while? Considering how hard it is to find boba around this town, I'm not complaining-I would go back and try another flavor, but I wouldn't have high expectations.  Look, if you want soup with noodles, this place will do. But if you want RAMEN, with rich, complex broth that isn't overly salty, with tender pork and handmade noodles, I would skip this place. With enough hot sauce, it was definitely edible, but it wasn't what I was craving (since I was craving ramen)...and so I am disappointed.

The espresso drinks are decent...on the smoother side, but not my fave. The iced almond milk chai, however, is absolutely phenomenal! It's cinnamon-y and sweet and unique. I've had it with soy milk before (when I hadn't realized that they offered almond milk) and it was very good, but with almond milk it was even more delicious! It's definitely not syrupy sweet, it's just the perfect balance of sweet and spice.   The atmosphere is pretty cool, with many different seating areas, though it was tough to find a seat when I went. I'll definitely be back!

I just got home from dining at Renegade Canteen, and I've gotta say...not worth it, at all. I'm a big Roaring Fork fan, which is why I agreed to eat here, but this place didn't live up to RF's standards as far as I could tell.  To be fair, the service was lovely. Perfectly timed everything, not overbearing, happy to answer every question, took special orders without sighing as most servers do, and what was most noticeable was every server appeared to be at least 30 years old. They were very professional.  To begin, I browsed the cocktail menu and didn't see a drink that jumped out to me, but I did notice they had a prickly pear mojito, so I asked if it would be possible to have a prickly pear martini. They were happy to oblige, and it was delicious. This was probably the highlight of the evening.  The bread they brought out was decent, and there were two butter options, one plain and one herbed. Another really cool thing was our table-we had a large party and the table was huge and round, and there was a separate round top piece of the table that rotated around, making it easy to pass items between people.  For apps, most of my party ordered salads. I decided to branch out and ordered the crab meat "enchiladas", which tasted like old fishy canned tuna, served wrapped in lettuce. It advertised a "mango vinaigrette", which was seen only as a teeeeeny tiny drop on the plate. It should be noted that this bite tasted neither mango-y or like a vinaigrette. I had a bite of bf's plain side salad, which was alright, but that's pretty hard to screw up.  Entrees: I ordered the spinach crepes, which sounded awesome on the menu. Unfortunately, they were REALLY bland, and just didn't taste good at all. They were basically sauteed spinach and chopped pumpkin wrapped in a spinach "crepe"...but the crepe was incredibly dry and not good at all. It's served with two crepes, and I could barely make myself finish one.  I had a bite of the pot roast, which was pretty solid, and much tastier than my crepes, but as for the rest  of the entrees ordered (chicken, tagliatelle with truffle sauce, chicken flatbread), no one seemed wow-ed enough to finish. The burger that was ordered was reminiscent of Roaring Fork's "Big Ass Burger", but was not reported to be as good  as their version.  For a party of 7 people, you'd think if you ordered only 2 desserts, they'd be gobbled up with no problem. Not for us. The pecan pie and the ovaltine with rice krispy treat were passed around at least five times, and still no one could finish either. The pecan pie was served in a round metal dish and had ice cream on top, and the entire thing was sickly sweet, with no real crust to speak of, just sugary pecans. The ovaltine thing was about five things on a plate that were all bad-"frozen" ovaltine, which tasted like a bad chocolate mousse, stale cocoa and regular rice krispy treats, a caramelized banana, and "black caramel sauce", which no one could figure out and no one enjoyed. All of us are sweets people, I would like to point out, so it takes a lot for us to not finish a dessert!  Overall, I'd never go back here, but I'd still go to Roaring Fork (especially for their happy hour). The prices at Renegade Canteen aren't outrageous, but they're wayyy too high for the quality of food they're serving!

My parents insisted on coming here last week, as they had eaten here in December and loved it. Of course, I Yelped it before I agreed to go with them (hey, my time back in Scottsdale is precious-I won't want to waste a single meal on a potentially bad place). The reviews pretty much summed up our experience:  -Robert McGrath is gone (our server confirmed this for us) -New menu that's not as enticing -Food is awful now -Absolutely terrible management!  As reviews indicated, the place WAS good, before McGrath left. The menu also USED to be good, and food was good too, but is no longer the case. The three of us struggled with what to order, as nothing really sounded too great. My dad went with a chimichanga, my mom went with a Mexican chopped salad with shrimp, and I decided to have a Caesar with shrimp. My dad actually enjoyed his, until later that night when he became ill.  Both my salad and my mom's salad were pretty much inedible. The produce was clearly never high quality, as evidenced by the mealy tomatoes and wilty lettuce. But the worst part was definitely the fishy-tasting shrimp. How does that even happen?! How old were these shrimp that they developed a fishy taste?  The waitress stopped by for about .5 seconds right when the food was delivered, and since we hadn't really tasted anything yet, we said things were fine. However, a few minutes into our meal we realized we needed to speak to a manager about the poor quality of the food (especially since my parents had such high expectations from their prior visit). The waitress was absolutely nowhere to be found, nor was the manager, or any other employee for that matter. It took easily 10 minutes before we actually saw any employee of the restaurant-maybe they all took a break at the same time? We were one of only a few tables in the place, so it's not like our waitress was busy with someone else...  Anyway, we finally asked our waitress to grab the manager for us. ANOTHER 10 minutes went by before the manager showed up. When he arrived, we calmly explained that poor quality of nearly all the ingredients in both of our salads, and I told him about the reviews I'd read and how my parents insisted it was so good that we had to try it and that I'd hoped the reviews weren't true. I should mention he looked like a deer in headlights when I mentioned online reviews.   We expressed our disappointment (but we weren't obnoxious about it, I just really felt that it's only fair to tell the management about the poor food quality before writing a review online about it and told him so), and his response was simply: "You're the first people to complain all night!" Oh, great. The first ones all night? Do we get a prize? Does that mean you received food complaints yesterday, and the day before that? We're just the only ones to complain TODAY, which must mean our opinion isn't valid.   He didn't apologize. He didn't validate our feelings about the food as any good manager would. He just seemed confused as to how we could possibly have these opinions. But it gets better! He then says, "Well, the waitress said she checked and you guys said you were enjoying everything." Seriously? You can see very plainly that we have eaten almost nothing. Talk about feeling uncomfortable-it was like we were completely unable to have a low opinion of this place.   He said nothing more and walked away. He brought us the bill, with the salads removed, and walked away. Still no apology. We didn't ask for anything to be removed, we really only wanted him to acknowledge that the food sucked and that he'd do something to ensure future guests don't encounter fishy-fish and baggy lettuce. It was nice of him to remove the food from the bill, but there is just no excuse for making customers (a) eat crappy food, and then (b) feel uncomfortable about not enjoying it.

Definitely some of the best espresso in all of Scottsdale. My heart belongs to Lux, in Central Phoenix, but this is sooooooo much closer/convenient!   It has the feel of some of my favorite coffee places in NYC, with that indie/hipster vibe, but seriously high quality espresso. I didn't remember to ask what brand of beans they use, but I know it must be something good because this is some seriously smooth espresso!  I got a soy latte, and just like all of the best places, it's one double-shot, no matter what size you order. I do like that they have a 16oz size just for the people used to ordering a big drink, though. I opted for the 12 oz size and, despite the fact that it was quite warm outside and I was loving indulging in iced beverages while I was back in AZ , I knew that to really get the purest taste, it was best to go with a hot drink.  The owner (?) was also the barista and the cashier. Love that. He was happy to talk to me about the store, and how they had another location over at City North (that place is still around?) before this one. I used to work at a restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter before any other shops opened up, and if this place was here then, I would have definitely been spending a lot of money here!  I don't understand why someone would go to Starbucks, or Coffee Bean, or even Coffee Planation or Jolta Java (I support the local places but come ON, get some higher quality beans if you want me to come back!) when this place is so much better! It's a perfect place to grab a latte while you're shopping or if you need a little resting spot because your arms are sore from carrying those shopping bags full of new clothes.   Bonus: They have a discount on baked goods after a certain time (like 3 or 4pm I think?). Great for an afternoon pick-me-up!

Tsoynamis are one of my favorite foods in the world. I'm lactose intolerant and love blizzards, so it's a match made in heaven. I go to Green a lot as I live nearby, and have never felt unwelcome there, so I had no reason to think I'd feel that way about their sister joint, Nami. So after a disappointing dinner at Nobou at Teeter House in downtown phx, bf and I were excited to turn our night around with dessert at Nami when we realized we were super close to it and it was still open (since Green would have been closed by the time we got there). Their hours posted indicate they close at 9:30pm on Fridays, and we arrived at 9:20 after calling to confirm they were still open.   We walked in, and there were a few groups of people sitting and leisurely enjoying their ice cream and baked goods. We walked up to the counter and bf knew what he wanted right away (s'mores tsoynami with pb added...SO good!). I, on the other hand, needed a minute to decide since they had a huge bakery case filled with things I never see at Green and wanted to try out, in addition to the full tsoynami menu.   I asked a few questions, which the light-haired woman working there was happy to answer. She disappeared to make bf's tsoynami, though, and we were then met with an icy stare and complete annoyance by the dark-haired woman working there. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, and hey, it's Friday night and she probably wanted to close up so she could go out. But it wasn't even 9:30, and she had zero interest in making this customer happy.   I said I was debating between a cookie and a tsoynami, while she rolled her eyes and continued to tap her fingers on the counter. Her response, rather than a suggestion or recommendation for something to order, was, "We close in five minutes." Ok? I know that already? Why wouldn't you just try to hurry us along in a constructive way, rather than making me feel afraid to ask you any questions about your products?  She continued to sigh and look around, willing us to disappear, and honestly I wish we would have left right then. But we were starving, and I really wanted to enjoy one of their delicious looking treats. I decided in my head that I wanted a tsoynami, but I was way too afraid to have that lady actually prepare something for me as I was pretty sure she would spit in it, in addition to the length of time it would have taken to prepare which surely would have put us over her 5-minute limit. I said I'd take the cookie, to get us out of there sooner. We still had to wait another minute for bf's tsoynami to be finished, and felt her stare us down the whole time. Mind you, there are still parties of other customers at tables still lingering. We were definitely NOT responsible for keeping them open, but we sure were made to feel that way!  I don't care how tasty your treats are, I would never EVER go back there...who wants to leave a dessert place with such a sour taste in their mouth? I will be getting all of my future tsoynamis at Green, where they never make me feel like I'm doing something wrong by asking questions or spending a minute debating between a few items.

It was New Years Day, and bf and I were driving back from Flagstaff craving BBQ. We managed to miss the exit off the I-17 to go to one of the bbq joints up in Anthem, and when we tried to go to another nearby bbq place (Pork on a Fork) they were closed. Finally, we found one more option that wasn't too out of the way, Campfire Bistro! It's close to the Ice Den where I spent many a Friday night in middle school, so it brought back fond memories of singing to Smash Mouth and Backstreet Boys while ice skating with friends.   When I realized this place was in a gas station, I was skeptical but hopeful. When I walked in I was surprised to see what basically looks and feels like La Grande Orange-it's in a market with upscale cool things to buy like wines, cheeses, meats, and fun tchatchkies to look at and play with. There's a register counter near the front when you walk in, and Campfire is on the righthand side of the shop further down from the entrance. It's easy to find once you're in.  They have a seating area near the soda fountains (COKE PRODUCTS, SCORE! they even have cherry coke from the fountain!), and there is a wonderful display of BBQ sauces with pretty dead-on descriptions of the flavor profiles of each. There's to-go ramekins for you to squeeze the bbq sauces into, and of course bf and I took at LEAST one of each. They let us borrow a sharpie to label the sauces so we would remember which was which, that was way helpful!  I was immediately attracted to the BBQ tacos-they came with a choice of pulled chicken, pulled pork, and brisket, and they come in an order of 3 and are served on flour tortillas (YES!). When I saw that there were 3 meat options and you get 3 tacos in the order, of course I asked if I could get one of each taco, which the cashier happily obliged. Bf ordered the same thing, plus a pulled chicken sandwich to have for later which came with chips. Tacos didn't come with a drink or chips, but they were under $10 for three of them, and they were all very tasty! Tender, juicy meat on a soft, fresh tortilla with salsa and some other goodies sprinkled on top.  Bf agreed that all of them were delicious, and I think we both decided the chicken is the winner here. All of the bbq sauces were good, though the spicy ones were VERY spicy!   Cheap, delicious, creative...I will be back!   P.S. I noticed after I ordered that on the menu board, in VERY small print, that they offer BACON WAFFLES. Um, why is this not the main attraction?! Why not put it in bold letters and let the world know you offer this?! I definitely need to try these!!!

Found this place on Yelp this morning when searching for a new place to grab some breakfast/lunch to go. It's just a few miles down the road from us, in a strip mall you wouldn't look twice at, just above the Tempe border on Hayden.   After reading enough convincing reviews, we checked out the menu and called in an order to pick up. The guy on the phone was so friendly and helpful! He let my bf sub turkey for ham on his bfast sandwich, and explained that he could just straight sub out the same amount of turkey for ham and it wouldn't cost extra, but if he paid $2 more he would get a full serving of turkey (same amount they'd put on a turkey sandwich). He opted for the upcharge and reported that it was well worth it!  I ordered the Prima breakfast sandwich, which says it comes with bacon, but I didn't see or taste any (which ended up being just fine). The first bite was a taste explosion in my mouth-so much flavor! The eggs tasted fresh and the tomatoes were perfect...combined with the gooey cheese, the perfect pesto, and the crispy/fluffy ciabatta bread it was exactly what I was craving. Definitely my favorite breakfast sandwich in the area, and it's cheap to boot!  I ordered an iced soy chai, which is so unlike chais anywhere else-it's FRESHLY MADE! From actual tea and spices! And the lemonade tasted like a state fair frozen lemonade, only better-super fresh and tangy but sweet. The total for both of us was just under $20 (two sandwiches, one with turkey added, and two drinks). Great deal, considering how fresh everything is!  As for atmosphere, I can see coming here with a laptop and getting some work done (they have free wifi!), When you walk in, it's bright and friendly and the dudes working there take pride in their ingredients, which shows. I can't wait to come back for lunch!

I am very picky when it comes to espresso. I only like very smooth, silky roasts in my soy lattes, and this place has got it down to an art. They use plain soy milk (none of that vanilla crap) so you can really taste the espresso, and they have simple syrup on the condiment bar which I have recently realized is something to be thankful for, since most places are much too lazy to throw together some hot water and sugar for their customers (ahem, black cat and press...).  The woman who is always working when I stop by in the mornings is amazingly friendly considering the horrific mood I typically find myself in prior to stopping here, since it's located conveniently just a few blocks from my office and I am always running late and am very impatient! She always whips up my drinks quickly and with a genuine smile, and on the few occasions when I've had time to chat she seems knowledgeable about the coffee they serve.  I've also had the iced toddy here, which was alright but nothing special, especially when compared to the espresso drinks. My iced soy latte is a little over $4 which seems to be the going rate these days (compared to my other faves, Cartel, Jobot and Echo). I can't really speak to if this is a good place to spend time on your laptop or not, as I've only gotten my drinks to go. However, every time I've been (morning and afternoon) it has been completely empty, so I assume it would be a consistently quiet spot to get work done.   Definitely the best espresso in this 'hood!

Yummy pressed juices! Found this place on Yelp when I was looking to kill some time waiting for an Rx refill at Walgreens at McCormick Ranch. Endurance Cafe is inside the LA Fitness, but you don't have to be a member to get to the juice bar (I hate it when the juice bar is in the back of a gym and requires membership to get to it). It's on the right hand side when you walk in the gym.    I was welcomed to the juice bar by the dude who appeared to be the one in charge of the juice bar operations/ordering/menu. I saw no signage indicating if the produce used in the juices is organic, but the brawny man behind the counter assured me all the fruits and veggies they use are organic. This made me happy! I asked about the pressed juices, as I have been craving them ever since moving away from NYC 6 months ago where pressed juice is everywhere (though it is very pricey out there)!   I was excited to see that they had pressed juices and not just smoothies. I don't think they use the fancy-schmancy Norwalk pressed juicers, but I'd argue that my drink tasted pretty damn nutritious. I ordered a basic juice to see how it was-I believe I got the carrot apple ginger or something along those lines (it was a couple weeks ago). I was surprised at how creamy and delicious it was! If the produce isn't the perfect ripeness it can taste off, but this was perfect. Slightly sweet and creamy and just a bit tart, this was 100% pure goodness.   BTW, they use amazing ice! I know, it's just ice, but they use the tiny round cubes that they use at Coffee Bean which I love, they're so good! You can get your juice with or without ice, and I opted to have ice with mine as I have always found room-temperature drinks disconcerting.  Prices are definitely fair for what they're serving (assuming that it is, in fact, organic produce). It's less than I would pay for juices of a comparable size in NYC and the quality is the same, so for around $7 I'd say its a fair price. The other drinks on their menu are less expensive, but pressed juices are always gonna be up there in price, so keep that in mind. This ain't no Jamba Juice!   I can't wait to come back to try other things on the menu, as the food and other drinks sound delish as well. Only issue is, I always feel weird walking into a gym in street clothes with zero intention of working out!
