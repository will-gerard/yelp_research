I chose Southwest Dental Group because they were in network for my dental insurance at the time and have a convenient location between my office and my home.  When I called to ask if the office was accepting new patients, the not so friendly girl on the other end of the phone told me yes.  I then asked if I could schedule a cleaning and exam, and set an appointment for a Friday afternoon.  Turns out this office does not actually set up cleanings and exams for the same day.  Too bad the girl who booked my appointment didn't bother to clarify this with me.  I took a half day at work on the day of my appointment just in case it took longer than expected.  All that I had done on my first visit was have x-rays taken (that looks like its from the 1980's and required at least 20 different images to be taken separately), and had the dentist look at my teeth.  Once the dentist finished his exam, the technician who assisted with the x-rays started to lead me to the front of the office to the exit.  When I let her know I was supposed to be getting a cleaning as well, she directed me to the assistant at the front desk (based on her attitude, I'm pretty sure it was the girl I initially spoke to on the phone).  She informed me that their office does not schedule cleanings and exams on the same since they won't have an idea of who to clean my teeth without the dentist first evaluating the type of cleaning I will need.    I was annoyed to learn I would have to schedule another appointment to have my teeth cleaned.  Had the office not already billed my insurance for the cleaning and exam (as they are considered one visit with my insurance), I would've gone somewhere else for the cleaning.  When i came back for the routine cleaning, the dental tech cleaning my teeth spent the entire time trying to sell me on upgrade services like teeth whitening even after I told her I wasn't interested in the service at the start of the appointment.

Stopped in around 4:30 today and sat in the bar area to get the HH deals.  After waiting at our high top table for about 15 minutes, a manager stopped over to see if we had been waited on.  We told him "no" and he ran off to grab some menus.  When he came back, he assured us one of his servers would be over right away to take our order.  Since it wasn't busy, we figured this would be true.  About another 10 minutes went by without being acknowledged by a single staff member, so we decided to leave.  We headed over to Firebirds, where we had exceptional service and excellent HH drinks.

This is a great spot for a date or dinner with friends.  The menu features tapas, bruschetta and pizzas - all great for sharing.  They also offer a variety of wine flights in case you can't choose just one!  I've only been to this location on the weekend, and they always have live music.

Dr. Quaranta and his staff do an outstanding job of making sure you feel like an important individual, unlike larger practices and chains.    I've been a patient of Dr. Quaranta's for about two and a half years now.   During my first exam with him, I purchased a great pair of plastic frames.  Fast forward to 2014, and my beloved glasses broke in half (literally, right in the middle of the nose piece) when I was cleaning the lenses.  I realize my glasses are a couple years old, so the fact that time caught up with them did not surprise me, but I was definitely bummed that I could no longer wear my favorite frames with out some type of major repair.    I decided to stop by office to see if my frames could be saved.  I was immediately greeted by a friendly receptionist who asked how she would help me and I told her I wanted to see if my frames could be repaired.  Before I could even give my name, optician Christy greeted me by name.  She pulled up my file, let me know that the warranty on the glasses has expired but said she would see what she could do for me.  I expected her to give me a quote on repairing the frames, but instead, she gave me a great price on replacement frames.  When I came back in a week later to pick up the new pair of frames, Dr. Quaranta was at the desk, also immediately greeted me by name and even asked about things I told him almost a year ago during my last exam with him.  I am very impressed with the care and service the Sonoran Desert Eye Center team provides and I will be a patient for life.

I'm so happy I found Verde Salon.   When I relocated to the Phoenix area a couple years ago, I wasn't sure I would be able to replace the stylist I left back home.  After trying a few different salons in the area, I came across Verde and haven't looked anywhere else since!  I've been a client for more than a year and have never had a bad experience here.  The first thing you will notice when you arrive for your appointment is how fresh the air is in the salon - no strong chemical smells from products since everything Verde uses is toxic-free.  The entire staff is super friendly, helpful and makes sure you feel pampered throughout your visit.  I am always offered a drink (sparking water, coffee, tea, etc), and delicious Dove chocolate to help unwind at the beginning of my service.    For me, the best thing about Verde Salon is my stylist, Maren.  I always leave her chair loving my cut (and sometimes color) since she does a thorough consultation at the start of each appointment to understand exactly what I want that day.  Maren also makes my appointment time fly by - she's outgoing, funny and easy to talk to.  If you want to book with Maren, you better do it now since she seems to book up very fast.
