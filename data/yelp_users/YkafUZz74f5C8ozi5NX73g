The family and I were looking to grab some lunch at Chipotle, but we got lost and came to Kokopelli instead. It's similar to Chipotle - made to order burritos and other typical Mexican food - but Chipotle it is not.  To tell you the truth, I wasn't too hungry to begin with so I ordered a chicken quesadilla and I got exactly that - a tortilla with cheese and chicken. Nothing else. Even though it was what I ordered and contained all ingredients necessary to live up to its description, I just felt like the whole thing was "meh". I got some pico de gallo on the side which helped a bit, but I was only given a little to-go cup full (there is no salsa bar) and given my salsa usage, it only lasted a couple bites.  The burritos ordered by the rest of my family didn't seem all that interesting either. I didn't get to taste anything but, from first glance, the bean to burrito filling ratio was wrong (too much beans, not enough meat - what can i say, I'm picky about my burritos!) and the burritos seemed as "meh" as my quesadilla was.   I wish we had gone to Chipotle.

There are two types of rooms at the Palace Station Hotel - tower rooms and courtyard rooms. The difference between these two rooms are like night and day. Trust me, you DON'T want a courtyard room.  I was here for a convention/conference a while back and, seeing I was cheap, I booked a room in the courtyard. Ehhh...bad decision. Lemme just put it this way - when you walk from the main hotel/casino to the courtyard area, you walk outside for a brief moment to cross over into the courtyard. In the hotel, you have nice automatic sliding doors and elevators, once you get into the courtyard, you have to open doors yourself and take the stairs. Doesn't sound like a huge difference but it is. I mean, think about it...when was the last time you went to a hotel that DIDN'T have automatic sliding doors?  The rooms weren't that nice either, once you get inside, it reminds me of a Holiday Inn or Motel 6. Average but livable.  The tower rooms, which I had the opportunity to see later, are much nicer. Actually, much nicer is an understatement - you're actually getting a room that makes you think you're in Las Vegas. You get a larger room to begin with, nicer sheets, a flat screen TV, a cleaner bathroom - everything's just nicer. I think they recently remodeled all the tower rooms, which explains why the drastic difference in decor.  Therefore, if you HAVE to stay here (because I don't see why you would stay here under your own free will if you have so many other options in Vegas), pay the extra twenty bucks and bump yourself up to the tower. It's just not worth it stay in the courtyard...

Apparently, the Hooters Hotel has 24-hour $3 blackjack tables. I mean, there are banners posted against the building outside, there are signs above the slot machines...The Hooters Hotel is supposed to have 24-hour $3 blackjack tables.  My friend and I walked into the Hooters Hotel. We looked for these $3 blackjack tables. We circled the casino three times.  THERE WERE NO $3 BLACKJACK TABLES.  One star for false promotions.  (I was looking forward to cheap gambling too!)

Of all the many many times I've come to Vegas (and I've been coming to Vegas since I was ten), I've never stayed near Fremont Street until this past visit. It's definitely a different vibe down towards that side of town - better? worse? That's more personal preference.  The Four Queens Hotel was a little weird, partly because you need to get this paper placard to put on your dash in order to get free parking. Yes, parking is NOT free unless you stay at that hotel (which seemed odd to me since I'm so used to the Strip and parking wherever/whenever you want). It's not that big a hassle but definitely a little weird.  Location wise, you're close to Fremont Street and get to see the street performers and things going on down there. The light show was nothing special, we spent most of our time watching the spray paint artist make paintings with just a couple cans of paint. Definitely more fun than straining our necks watching an outdated light show...  The room itself wasn't half bad, but you definitely cannot compare it to the usual Vegas hotels. I don't remember much else, I wasn't in the room for very long - I spent most of my day down by the Strip in order to get the Vegas experience I'm used to.   If you don't care about the Strip want want to check out the Fremont experience, you can consider the Four Queens. But, if you're looking for the Vegas Strip - go there instead. Fremont Street can't really compare.

I'm doing the unthinkable.  I'm giving Bobby Flay five stars.  I didn't want to like Mesa Grill. I saw it on the Las Vegas Michelin guide and told the boy, "I can't believe they gave Bobby Flay of the Food Network a star. How can simple Southwestern food compare to the complexity of French food?"  Well, I was wrong.  Mesa Grill is many things, but simple is not one of them.  Starting with the bread basket, you could tell this was going to be something interesting. Amidst the bread lay a yellow and blue corn cornbread muffin, filled with little pieces of corn and peppers. The boy had problems buttering his cornbread so he didn't enjoy it as much, but I really liked it. Even the white bread had bits of jalapenos in it, adding a definite kick to the start of your meal.  Next, the appetizers. We ordered the blue corn pancake with barbecued duck (sort of like a BBQ peking duck) and a goat cheese chorizo tamale. Neither did it for me, but who cares about the appetizers? I was too distracted by their margaritas.  Here's a word of wisdom to everyone who is thinking about coming to Mesa Grill: ORDER A MESA GRILL MARGARITA.  After trying a Mesa Grill margarita, I'm not quite sure if I can drink anything else. Their margaritas are what a margarita should taste like - top shelf tequila (it was smoother than some vodka I drink!), fresh lime juice, quality salt...it was totally light, totally refreshing...If only they made yard long drinks of THAT.  Anyway, back to the meal - the boy ordered the dry rubbed pork tenderloin while I had the pan seared halibut. The boy's pork tenderloin was tender. Actually, tender doesn't even begin to describe it - every time I took a bite, it had the texture of filet mignon. Just the way they prepared it was mindblowing. My halibut was flakey and moist, but if I could have done it all over again, I would have ordered the tenderloin too.  The thing I think I love the most about Mesa Grill is that the whole experience is unlike anything else I've tried. You can't compare the flavors to anything else - everything we tasted was in your face, upfront and bold...  ....Almost like Bobby Flay's personality.  Wow. I've been converted.

Thomas Keller, you're such a disappointment.   I had such high hopes for the man who created French Laundry that I expected greatness in the form of a croque madame and sour cream waffles. I envisioned the ordinary to become extraordinary, I dreamed of waves of flavor dancing on my tongue...Instead the highlight of my meal were the fries that came with the croque madame.   ...Wait, I don't think you understand what I just said - FRIES WERE THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY MEAL.  Bouchon was completely underwhelming. The waffles were soggy, as was the toast in the croque madame. There was nothing that made me go "wow", everything tasted like it would at any other place.  Not only was the food mediocre, but for a restaurant of this stature, I'd expect good service. Instead, we had the busboy taking our orders and attempting to answer our questions. Where was our waiter? I have no idea...we only saw him once or twice the entire meal.  So Thomas, why did you put your name to something so blah? I hope you don't disappoint me when I finally make the trek to your pride and joy up north...

Just say you know Brandon.  ...Okay, don't say you know Brandon. Actually, to tell you the truth, I don't even know Brandon. But somehow, by name dropping some guy I don't even know, I was able to bypass the 2-3 hour line for Tao on Halloween, get in without cover (the guys in our group didn't have to pay cover either) and party it up on the dance floor with a bunch of guys in cow costumes.  (Cow costumes? Wow, that's hot.)  Actually, I was never a huge fan of Tao, even though, both times I've been, I've gotten in without cover. The first time I went, the dance floors downstairs were playing house (not my thing) and I got into a huge argument at Tao Beach. (Yay for drama in Vegas clubs!...Not.) Considering that experience, I was a little apprehensive about going back to Tao again.  Boy, was I wrong - Tao on Halloween was crazy! Like I said, I got to dance with a bunch of cows, the DJ's were bumping great dance music, they had Tera Patrick hosting/emceeing for the night (although I couldn't tell if she was hot or not though), and it was just good times all around.   Notes to remember:  - Do not dance on the furniture (I found that out the hard way).  - Do not bother going to Tao Beach - it's too crowded, there's really no room to dance, and the bathrooms are ridiculously far away from the general Tao Beach area (as I discovered during my first outing to Tao).  - Worse comes worse, name drop Brandon. (Hey, it can't hurt, can it?)

I only call out wait staff by name when they're exceptional.  With that said, Dominic, this review goes out to you.  I'm going to start this review writing about the service, mainly because I think our waiter, Dominic, was one of the best wait staff I have ever had the pleasure of meeting at a restaurant. Him, alone, gives Daniel Boulud two stars. The food and ambiance add a star a piece (but I'll touch on those later as they're really of no real importance to me).  It's hard finding good service in high class restaurants. You need someone enthusiastic, but not fake, with just enough charm to make the night run smoothly. Dominic was not only all of that, but he was insightful and knowledgeable - enough so that he was able to recommend a fantastic bottle of wine for the boy and I.  Grade A service goes a long way - and this is from someone who's usually not a stickler for service.  As for the food, the boy and I started off with a lobster bisque and a steak tartare. The bisque was very light and well seasoned, and had little bits of bacon in it, which added a nice smokiness to the dish. The boy really enjoyed the steak tartare since he's never tried it before and I loved it since I love raw meat.  For our entrees, we (of course) ordered the signature Daniel Boulud burger and one of the specials of the day, which was soft shell crab over three types of tomatoes (one of which was a fried green tomato...I don't remember the other two). I personally thought the burger had a funny texture, probably due to the short ribs stuffed inside, and couldn't taste the foie gras at all (which was highly disappointing as I love foie gras). The soft shell crab had a nice presentation but flavor wise, again, was nothing really amazing.  All in all, it was an experience though, so I guess that's what counts. Come for the overall experience and the service, and let the food just compliment that.  **SEE PICTURES POSTED**

I love Rain. No, not the Korean pop star.  Music's always good (I'm into the pop/hip-hop/rap thing so it's right up my alley), the place is always packed (which is a good thing and a bad thing - girls, bring some guy friends to cock block all those other sleazy guys in the club), and even though the club is disgustingly humid from all the bodies anyways, I can never get enough of the fire shooting ceiling.  Line gets really long pretty early though so be prepared to flirt with some bouncers if you don't feel like waiting in line. And, if you have enough people, get a cabana - it's definitely worth it.

I refuse to settle for shitty things. I refuse to stay some place miles from the Strip, I refuse to stay in crappy hotels, and I refuse to pay more than $200/night for such a room.  Part of me didn't think that was possible when I was trying to find a room last week. It was the Monday before Memorial Day, I had five days until I was supposed to check in, and I had yet to book a room. I was resigning myself to the idea of disappointment when I found all of the above at the MGM Signature (thanks to the help of Yelp, of course).  Yes, you heard me, I got everything I wanted and more!  The rooms here can be very affordable if you book your room through VRBO.com. The Signature is actually a condo/hotel so you can book your rooms through MGM as a hotel (and pay hotel prices) or book your rooms through the owner of the room (and pay ridiculously cheaper prices). How much of a price difference are we talking about here? MGM Signature website, Monday night - $300/night for a junior suite. Though VRBO - $194/night for the same room...and that was five days before Memorial Day.  (Quick plug! The guy I booked my room with was amazing. I wrote him an email, got a response within the hour. He made the transaction so easy, no hassle, no problems, and gave me the best price ever. If you want his info, message me. He's seriously amazing.)  Not only are the rooms at the Signature affordable, but they're also gorgeous and big. The Signature is an all suites hotel so you get the king sized bed, a jacuzzi tub, free wireless in the rooms, two bottles of free water a day, flat screen TVs, a DVD player, a kitchen with a stove, microwave and fridge, a TV in the bathroom...you get it. The room's freaking nice. And you get access to their private pools PLUS the usual MGM pools. Seriously, it's great.  Now, to complete the trifecta of awesomeness, the Signature is close to the Strip. It's connected to the MGM hotel, but you can walk to the Strip easily (that is, if you don't mind walking).  There is a downside to the Signature though - valet is really slow and you can't self park. But other than that, it's seriously one of the best places I've stayed in Vegas!  I think, from now on, the Signature is going to be my hotel of choice when I visit the City of Sin.

From a girl who was born and raised in sunny SoCal, when I walked into True Food Kitchen, I thought to myself, "Wow...this place is so LA." Minimalist (yet natural) design, hip waitstaff...it would fit right into Los Angeles. However, True Food is a little too LA: it's all looks but no substance.  True Food Kitchen cooks with a very literal defintion of vegetarian/vegan food in mind, which results in overly bland foods. Probably healthy, but still overly bland.  The brother and I split the carmelized onion tart to start, and I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole as my main entree. To call the onion tart a tart is misleading - It should be described as more of a flatbread pizza (or, in our case, a very charred flatbread pizza), with gorgonzola cheese, figs and onions as toppings. The figs were slightly burnt as was the bottom of the bread, so the taste of onions and cheese was masked by the taste of charred food.  The spaghetti squash casserole was exactly what it was described to be: spaghetti squash with mozzarella, tomatoes and zucchini. It tasted like squash and zucchini mixed with marinara sauce and baked with cheese on top. Nothing more. The first couple of bites were fine, but I got sick of it halfway through.  If you're into very simplistic, healthy food, True Food might be right up your alley. But, it just lacks the flavor and depth of other vegetarian restaurants I've been to and overall, I just wasn't impressed by anything I tried.

Some people call Las Vegas "the City of Sin". ...Well, if that's the case, toss me a pitchfork and call me a sinner because I love Las Vegas and I especially love XS.  XS just exudes what I expect from Vegas - and that's sin. Just imagine...  It's Saturday night and you and your closest friends are decked out for the night - your hottest outfits, your sexiest shoes, not a single hair or eyelash out of place. (*Pride*)  Where are you going to go? XS.  You strut your pretty selves over to the line at XS. Schmooze a little bit with the bouncers, get yourself to the front of the line, walk through those golden front doors, up the stairs and then...you're there. The room opens up to the hottest club in Las Vegas. Bars to either side, a dancefloor right in front of you and, behind all that, a large pristine pool, with the water glistening under the moonlight.  You and your girls push your way onto the dance floor, find a little space to call your own, immerse yourselves in the music, dance like there's no tomorrow...until you catch a glance of someone out of the corner of your eye. (*Lust*)   Who is he?  What's his name?  ...Who is that effing chick all up on him?!  (*Lust* turns to *Envy*. *Envy* turns to *Wrath*.)   Wait...breathe. Don't forget, you're at XS - there's plenty of fish in the sea here. If you don't find someone at the beginning of the night, you'll probably find one towards the end.  What if dancing's not your thing? Fine then, get yourself a drink...or two...or ten...(*Gluttony*)  Don't feel like drinking? There are blackjack tables in the back where you can win your fortunes or lose it all. (*Greed*)  Are you just tired at the end of the night? Cool your toes in the pool and just lounge around...(*Sloth*)  XS embodies everything I love about Las Vegas. It's extravagant and beautiful.  It's classy but debaucherous. Hey, if you're going to sin, you might as do everything in excess...at XS...

Typically, for the 4th of July, most people hang out with friends at a bbq and cool down by a pool. My family, on the other hand, decides to  travel to a city with a historical average temperature for that weekend of 100+ degrees.  Smart one.  Luckily, the parents chose a fancy-smancy hotel for us to stay at for our long weekend away: The Arizona Biltmore. It's a gorgeous hotel in the middle of Phoenix whose claim to fame is that every US President since its opening in the 1920s has, at one point in time, stayed at the Biltmore. The hotel spans a huge area with 8 pools scattered across its grounds, the largest of which is right next to the lobby.   I was prepared to spend my weekend lying by the pool and studying for my exams. Instead, I discover my room is in the furthest corner of the Biltmore complex and I'd have to walk through 103 degree weather to get to the pool. I make the trek anyway (the thought of pina coladas and mojitos spur me forward), only to find out the pool is filled with little kids. I finally find an empty chair below a beach umbrella, plop myself down and order my drink from the waitress (while the little twins sitting in the chair next to me start dripping over my books). The drink arrives and...I can't taste a drop of rum in my mojito.  ...There goes my perfect weekend.  Other than my disappointment by the pool, the rooms were nice and, most importantly, the A/C worked. Plus, at night when the temperature cooled down a bit, it was nice to walk around the Biltmore and admire the architecture.  Four stars overall.
