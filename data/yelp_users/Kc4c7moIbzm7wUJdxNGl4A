Super good coffee! Classic yet modern atmosphere. It gets crowded fast on the weekends so get hear early to get a table! Chia tea latte isn't the best I've had but the classic coffee is great! Free wifi makes it easy to study! It's my study spot for sure! Super nice staff and everyone looks like they are having a good time!

This restaurant is amazing for good sushi. The happy hour after 8 is great and has a lot of options. The blue flame roll is amazing and I will be coming back to try more!

We did this for a bachelorette party Saturday and it was an amazing experience! Bryan aka Skipper, was the best driver you could ask for! He took us around to little bars and was really social with us! He cracked jokes and hung out! I lost my wallet during the experience and he helped me find it like a true gentleman! We all had a blast and we look forward to doing it again! Thanks again!

Amazing! Absolutely in love! Can pick a million different toppings for a flat rate of $7.95! You can be as creative as you want and every pizza is amazing. I am a huge fan of Fired Pie and will be coming back a million times over. 1 pizza can be spit between two people if you get a salad or something else on the side. Its perfection.

This place could have been great, but I noticed too many flaws while eating here. It takes a great deal to make me actually go on Yelp to complain about a restaurant. First off, it was a quiet Sunday night, on April 24th and we had a party of 7. We were told that they were setting up and "cleaning" a table for us. When we were taken to our table it was still dirty, there was a puddle of spilt water on the floor, and chunks of food on the floor that my boyfriend had to step on in order to get to his seat. I was shocked because this restaurant should be of higher class.   Next was the dining experience. We had a female waitress that only made dining at this restaurant even more awkward. She took our drink orders and made me feel judged and belittled for only drinking water and not purchasing an alcoholic beverage on a Sunday night. Next, when I received my order of chipotle shrimp tacos, I immediately noticed that the avocado was bruised and black in some places. Again, I'm spending a decent amount of money for this food. I would expect bruised avocado from filibertos, not this place. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. The waitstaff barely checked on us and almost seemed that because we were in a group that didn't purchase what they preferred, that we didn't matter.   All around, I'm disappointed that this restaurant is considered the same caliber as other Fox restaurants I ate ate North Italia in Kierland earlier that day and had a wonderful experience. I would not go back to Blancos after the experience I had.
