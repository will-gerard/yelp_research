Came in with a few of my girls on our pre evening girls date! It was pretty quiet and the girl that helped us wasn't really friendly which is why I didn't give them a 5 star. Also because the prices are pretty high for ice cream that's next to a college campus! Besides that the ice cream was delicious best mint ice cream I've had in a while I recommend it with chocolate ice cream and brownies!

I fell in love. Today was my first time ever going to a shooting range, holding a gun and of course shooting. I walked in pretty terrified and of course my boyfriend was getting carried away with picking his gun and getting a target. After the wonderful man gave us our safety equipment, gun, and bullets we entered the shooting range. I literally had a panic attack and left. Then Gary (one of the enployees) asked me if I was having fun. I told him my life story and how this is my first time! He gave me ear plugs and better ear gear. Then I went back in and finally after an hour I loosened up. I pulled my first trigger it was a great time. All of the staff members were incredible and the manager don't get me started she's a piece of perfection. I'll be back for ladies night  Thank you Teds Staff you guys are amazing!!!

The staff members are the sweetest and the food was without a doubt 5 stars. If you haven't tried there traditional burrito or any of there breakfast items yet you're missing out!

This place is phenomenal I've been coming here since they've opened and since then they've kept me as a more than satisfied customer! I used to get my nails done by Kenny but now mainly Tracey! Her and her husband are the owners and they are a dynamic duo! If you haven't found your nail spot or want a change come here! They are always clean, have great customer service and the service is perfect every time

My favorite shaved ice place and location! The staff is very friendly and so helpful. I come in with friends and also my family, they have adorable board games and cute activities if you do choose to come with the fam! But let's get to the point the shaved ice is to die for its so smooth and actually tasty unlike most shaved ice places with there "chunky ice rock" like shaved ice! I recommend a Watermelon, Apple, and Blue raspberry without creme it's the best combo in my opinion!

Went there on Valentine's Day and it was an amazing experience our waitress was super helpful and incredibly polite! She had us in tears laughing and would always come by to check on us even though they were quite busy! We even saw the owner checking in with almost all his customers what an amazing guy! The whole scenery in this restaurant is romantic and not the awkward quiet kind! It's definitely a place you can come in chat and eat some delicious Italian food! My boyfriend and I decided to split and pizza and pasta. Definitely appetizing  if you're on Gilbert road on a date this would definitely be my first choice!
