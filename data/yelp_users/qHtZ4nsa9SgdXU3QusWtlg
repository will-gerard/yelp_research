A few of my coworkers and I decided to get a few bowls to-go for lunch.  I was so hungry so I was really looking forward to the Salmon bowl I had ordered.   The vegetables were dry as well as the salmon. There were hardly any terriyaki sauce which didn't really give much taste to the entire dish. It wasn't what I was expecting.  Sadly, the oriental food bowls that Costco have in packages probably taste better.

I don't often shop at Last Chance but every now and then I would check the place out to see if there's anything worth the buy.  If you like brands and designer bargains than you'll find this place great just cause they have pretty good deals. However, if you don't really care much for that, than this place is not anything special.   When I shop here I often look for good deals on shoes just because some of the shoes they sell here are definitely more reasonable to buy. For example, I found Nike shoe that's in real good condition or new that's worth $24 compared to an $80 or more Nike shoe at the actual Nike store. Why pay more? When you can pay less and still get pretty good merchandise. This is also where I get great deals on heels and other casual everyday shoes.  Though, you really do have to look and find the things you want because not all merchandise are either new or in good condition. Sometimes, you'd have to double check because some may have damages or will look old. You really have to have patience to go through the racks and really search the store for great merchandise; possibly dodge a few aggressive shoppers who may find you in their way of shopping.   This store is not gonna seem appealing to the eye at first but you'll get use to it and really the sales and and other deals of what they have to offer is something you might want to look into. It's not guaranteed that the moment you walk in this store you'll find something you are looking for.  Sometimes you'll have great luck and end up purchasing awesome stuff of your liking but there will be days when you'll find your self-shopping here and end up empty handed by the time you leave the place.   Everyone has different preferences when shopping or buying certain things so it just really depends on the person. The only way you'll know is if you actually go and check the place out yourself.   I gave this place a 4 star because I like shopping here. I find good deals and am always happy with what I've purchased so far at least. :D

This place is just awesome! I've only been to Clever Koi twice and so far, for both visits it had been great experiences. We went at night and sat outside for both visits. I prefer sitting outside because of the nice breeze from the high fans. You can also hear the light rail and few cars pass but overall its not too loud and just right. Inside of the restaurant  has a good touch up of trendy Asian interior. I find the place just perfect.   We ordered the calamari fries which was very good! It was tasty with a nice hint of lime.  You can actually taste the calamari unlike other restaurants where you can mostly taste what its breaded in rather than the calamari itself. I tried something new and ordered the spicy seafood hot pot. The broth was savory and the spice was just right with thick udon noodles.   We got the same server as last time and as usual service was outstanding. He was very informative with every questions we had about the menu. He checked up on us a couple times and ensured everything was good. Our server was friendly and gave us good suggestions on what to order.   Clever Koi is hidden but definitely worth the place to be checked out if you want to try something new. It's a great restaurant.

First time I went to eat at Angry Crab Shack was with my family. Of course I didn't know what to expect since I've never experience a messy eating type of food place.  Overall, the food was good and service was decent.   Just a month ago I went to Cali  with some friends and for the first time ate at Boiling Crab. I didn't want to compare Angry Crab Shack to Boiling Crab but I never realized how different it was after coming back a second time to Angry Crab Shack. I went to dinner at Angry Crab Shack and went with friends this time but It wasn't as great as the first since now I know what to expect. The wait is always going to take forever but when we were finally getting ready to be seated we noticed that they were out of a few selection of food. So, that sucks. We ordered 1lb of Trifecta- king crab legs, blue  crab, shrimp, oysters, mussels, and cajun fries.   When we got our food we couldn't help but notice how oily and flavorless the sauce was. And yes, since we live in the desert I guess its a given that seafood are not as fresh as we want it to be.  We didn't get lime + pepper&salt till a little later on after we got some of the food we ordered. It took almost till we were done eating with everything else before the fries was brought to the table. We were told that one of their fryers were broken and that's why it took a little longer for the fries to come out and that there were others who are waiting for it too. Yet, the people next to our table that was sat a little later after us got their fries in time before their main food was brought out. Hmmm, wonder how that happened.   The waitresses were nice and service was okay but it could have been better. I know at places like this its expected for it to be a really busy environment but it felt a little too chaotic and unorganized I think. If you're going to wait for an hour or more at least make the food worth the wait.   I'm not mean I swear or trying to bash on the place completely. I'm sure its the best were gonna get living out here in Az  that's close to the same idea of Boiling Crab. Overall, Angry Crab Shack is alright.

A friend of mine recommended this place to get my phone repaired. I was well satisfied with service. They were well knowledgable and answered any questions I have had regarding my phone. They were friendly and helpful! They even have a selection of phone accessories which was pretty cool and much cheaper than the ones sold in the malls! They sell tempered glass screen protectors so you might want to look into that if ever you're around the area. The prices are fairly reasonable which is great. The place isn't too difficult to find.  I find it convenient that  they're not specific to fixing just one product or item but others as well like apple products and androids; whether its a phone, laptop, or ipods they're skilled and capable of fixing almost anything. I'm glad I checked out this place. Will definitely come back if I need any future repairs on my electronic devices.   I would recommend you guys check this place out if you're looking for a good electronic repairs. :)

I went here to send a package to my cousin. I hardly get anything shipped but I figured it shouldn't be any trouble. When I walked in I was greeted instantly by this nice lady who was working there. She was very informative and was able to help me out with my every question.   Unfortunately, when I was getting ready to pay; there was supposedly a problem with the computer system that it wasn't taking my card cause I guess the computer froze. So, I had to swipe my card a few times. Good thing I checked my banking account or I wouldn't have known I was charged those many times. The person helping me out was aware of the situation so I guess its a good thing however it's such a hassle for me as a customer to have to deal with something like this.   Now, I'm stuck trying to get a hold of anyone to help me about getting my money back. Tried calling the two numbers I was told to call if the extra charges had gone through but I find it ridiculous to be on hold for so long.   That's the only reason why I rated this review with 2 stars.   Overall, its frustrating.

Checked out this restaurant on Saturday with my sisters and the bf to try something new. The outside of the restaurant didn't seem inviting but once you step inside the restaurant it looks cool. The ambiance was great! There were anime series projected in the wall near the bar. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant where the booths were and it was fairly comfortable.   Our service was decent. The server gave good suggestions and was helpful with any questions we had. He checked up on us a couple times. Overall pretty cool server.   We started off with the sugar cane pork as an appetizer. They were big portions and the sauce that it was marinated in was rich and sweet. The breading was delish but the inside was kind of dry. The Bf had the Kobe Pho which was very tasty and had a lot more meat and other ingredients mixed in then we expected. It was really good. One of my sisters, had the Red Thai Chicken and rice. The chicken was  nice and crispy. The other sister had one of the specials; I don't remember the name of it but the broth was savory just a bit oily though. It had thick udon noodles with a variety of seafood. I had the spicy red curry. It was okay it wasn't what I expected. Something seemed to be missing but overall it was eh. We also all ordered Thai tea for drinks and they were good. It was very light and not thick as what other restaurants would make thai tea.   Definitely would come back to try  their other appetizers and entrees they have. :)  I actually got the chance to try Bo Luc Lac today only because the Bf brought me lunch to work and got a to go from this restaurant. The salad was delicious! The vegetables were fresh and the meat was sweet and tasty!   I probably sound like a fatty in this review tasting everything haha! I was just curious and wanted to try the different dishes :P Check the place out!

This place is decent. Never really sat down to eat here but had always ordered for a to go. I haven't tried all but so far the few that my family typically orders is pretty good. The families favorite is the Mongolian beef.  They are also quick to getting the food ready. It'll probably take them about 10-15minutes.

I've never heard of this place (Hot n Juicy Crawfish) until my bf had suggested to check the place out. I went with a couple friends and the bf today to give it a shot. I wasn't expecting so much from it due to the past experience of another place with the same style of food (Angry Crab) that we tried and turned out quite a disappointment in the end.   Surprisingly, Hot n Juicy Crawfish turned out better than I expected. We got here around 3ish so it wasn't busy at all which was perfect cause we didn't want to wait for hours just to be seated. As soon as we were seated the waitress immediately got us started with our drinks. I was pretty impressed with how fast service was and how quickly they got our orders out. The waitresses/ waiters worked as a team and I thought that service was just excellent. It didn't matter who our waitress was because every now and they all took turns checking up on us asking if we needed anything else.   The food was GREAT! We ordered 2 lbs of hot n juicy shrimp, 1lb of snow crab legs, corn & cajun fries. Our friends ordered oysters, clams, and crawfish. They definitely give you good portions of the food; definitely a lot more than what we would have gotten if we went to Angry Crab. The food was fresh and delicious! We were so stuffed we almost didn't finish our food. The place was also very clean.   We had a great first experience at Hot n Juicy. I would recommend checking this place out. :)

I never knew about this place until a friend of mine mentioned it. So, I checked this place out with another friend for the first time and it turned out to be awesome! I love Cafe Zupas!   I ordered the Honey Bacon Club + Roasted Red Pepper and Lobster soup which was d'lish! My friend ordered Turkey Spinach Artichoke + Wild Mushroom Bisque which was also pretty good. I like how soft and fresh the sandwiches are and how the food came with a strawberry coated chocolate. :)   Of course, I came back a second time a few days later with my family and tried the Honey Cilantro Carnitas Sandwich. It was sweet and loaded with so much stuff but I loved it!
