This place is a joke.  The girls that were handling the cover wouldn't give me my money back from being in that place for only 1 min...   They weren't apologetic at all... On top of that, no one was in there.

They wouldn't honor pet co's online sale prices.  That's the first time I've heard about this.

Great $2.75 gin tonic happy hour.   If you like to get crunked this is  the place to go.   The bomb Golden chicken wings $5.   plus a great game room upstairs and huge big screen TVs to watch your fav team.

Absolutely appalling service!!  My friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday.    We got there around 5 pm and the place didn't seem busy at all.  We sat outside at the bar.  Our first bartender was extremely helpful, (15 mins) unfortuneately I didn't get his name.    The second bartender named Ted, (1 hour) was absolutely obnoxious.   He made rude remarks regarding his customers sitting at another table and  he signed my tab without my consent!   Forged my signature!   How awful was It to hear everything coming from his mouth and we're ALL paying customers!   I have been in the restaurant industry for number of years and experienced alot of different bars, and clubs.   I have not been treated soo horrible in my entire life.   Not to mention, he knew it was a friends birthday.    I will NOT go back to Dos Gringos-Scottsdale no matter how good looking the bartenders are.

I've been coming here 3 times a week, for either coffee, fresh pastry, great selections of soups, and deli.   I love how you can order hot foods by the pound,and I get to sample fresh apple juice, or their fine cheeses    I also get tempted to taste their wines, while I'm on my break.  :)  Their customer service is always helpful....I never give a place 5 stars, cause there's always room for some kind of improvement.

It was well worth the 40 min drive during lunch hour.   Loved walking through the garden with my dog and seeing many fresh veggies.   Definitely, we'll be back for breakfast.

What's best to support a local company?   No need Starbuks or coffee bean, when you can have great non burnt coffee.   The decor is fun n hip, I love seeing the different customers there too.   Everyone is nice n down to earth.... They also have wifi and great music, while u sip your hot or iced mojo....

What a waste of time.   Been here before and it was fine.   I had no problems.   Apparently, the people who work here kicked my friend out of this place, for no reason.    And?   My friend got jumped right outside of that place.

My first time here.   Great hole in the wall Lao style Thai restaurant.    I ordered paht ki mao lao style hot, drunken noodles.   First off, the portion is huge and its tasty.   I'm particular on my spice and they nailed it.   The waitress was helpful.   I will definitely come back to try their Som Tum, (green papaya salad) and other entrees.

I am born and raised in Hawaii.  This place totally reminds me of Hawaii.  For one, the Korean food is very similar to Hawaii's Korean food, like Yummies.  There's so many different plates to choose from BBQ chicken, Chicken Katsu, Spicy Pork, Kalbi, Meatjuhn-which is only Hawaii thing, etc... After you order your plate, you have 4 choices to choose from- mac salad, kimchee, cucumber kimchee, chop chae, sweet potato, corn, etc.   The price is reasonable for the amount of food that they give, and the owners are always nice.

I recently moved to Scottsdale from Hawaii.  For those of you who are not familiar with Hawaii.  Hawaii is a diversed state.  Almost all the salons that you go to, there's always someone that knows how to cut asian hair.   I am a licensed hairdresser, and also half-Korean.  I've been hesistant into finding a new stylist that understands asian hair/hairstyles. (Scottsdale isn't really a diversed area)My dear friend had suggested that I try Jim Jeon in Chandler.  I told him exactly what I wanted, which was shoulder length with lots of layers and side swept bangs.  I also told him to texturize couple places that I felt was too heavy, and he did exactly that!  I went home and styled it, and everything fell into place!  The drive is so worth it!  I will be definitely go back.

I'm born and raised from Hawaii, and this did not taste like anything back home.  I asked the owner if they are from Hawaii, and they said no, they haven't been there.   That was sooo disappointing.  I won't go back.  The service sucked too!

Moving here from Seattle, I longed for some great chowder and seafood and this place definitely delivered.  Owner is very polite and has a overall warm demeanor.  I bring my family here at least once or twice a month.

Being born and raised in Hawaii, (home to the orient) jasmine Tokyo is where I recommend people for great sashimi, sushi, and fresh oysters.

First off, I hate pushy salesmen.   They do make a commission based on purchases.   From day 1 stepping through the door Mcdowell's T-Mobile, Eric has been extremely helpful, patient, and honest regarding services and products.

Great place for women to get in shape.   Lauren was our instructor and she beat our asses.   Love all the random cardio workouts.  Squats, uppercuts, jabz, kicks, and more squats.

Let's support local restaurants, not chains.    Came here last night to celebrate my birthday.  I originally reserved for 24 people at 7:30, a few other people showed up, unexpectedly.      Nick, the owner, was very accommodating to my extra guests.   The whole staff did an amazing job servicing my whole party.   Being in the restaurant industry years ago, I know how complicated it is to cater a large party, on top of that-the restaurant itself was busy.   Food was excellent, wait staff was very courteous, lots of smiles, good times, and decor is cute cute cute.^_^   One of my guest said that she loved her red wine, which came from a keg-chilled.   I was slightly disappointed that they didn't offer braised Rabbit Bolognese, which i had when the restaurant first opened.  So i opt to choose the Bolognese with meatballs, every bite was orgasmic, and hearty.    The sauce was tangy which I love. I also tried their Lobster Risotto.  Risotto was cooked perfectly, the consistency of the texture sauce was spot on.  There was other great feedbacks.    I'm glad to have shared this unique Italia experience in Scottsdale with my friends.

I have to give this place 4 stars for giving Scottsdale some diversity.  Love the ambience and Korean bar food selections.    Another round of Cham Il sul Soju please.  I would have given ROK 5 only if they had No Rae bang - Karaoke.  :)
