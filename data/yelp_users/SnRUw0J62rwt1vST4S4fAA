Came here on a Sunday morning and the service was speedy enough to keep the line moving. Nice music and great feel to the place. The outside patio was a great place to eat, even with the sound of the traffic right up against 7th street. Food was outstanding with good portion sizes. I highly recommend the biscuits and gravy...incredibly fresh!  My family and I will definitely be back!

The food here is ok, and I'm fine with the small plates...that's what tapas is all about. The service at this place is so bad I'm thinking about throwing my computer. Zero personalities, major attitudes, I had to ask for a napkin, the server barely came by, and when I went to wash my hands and realized there was no more paper towels, the owner (?) gave me a whole unopened package so I could fill up the dispenser myself. What a joke. Save your patience and go to any other great restaurant in Scottsdale.
