Perfect date night/celebration spot!! The steak was perfectly cooked and the risotto makes for a perfect appetizer. There's truly nothing like it in the Phoenix area.

Such an underrated pizza place on mill! Talk about the perfect slice of cheese pizza.. Used to eat at this place every week freshman year, I've moved onto Spinellis but now that I'm writing this review all the memories are flowing back. We shall meet again Slices.

One of my all time favorite places to eat in Phoenix. Never met suck a friendly and knowledgable staff with such a thirst for great cuisine and drinks! Sit at the bar for the full experience. Get the voodoo penne with artisan bread, the lasagna, or luca's meatballs! Aanddddd absintheeeeeee!

I mean it's in n out burger howwwwwwjxjsndba could you give it a bad review. Even if it's one of the busiest in n out's out there it's so worth it who even cares if you gotta wait that extra 10 min for your double double with fries and a lemonade with extra spread on the side. Okay I'm craving in n out now. Bye.

So convenient for all Mill Ave District residents! Love all of the fun little trinkets they put out for us drunk college students to buy along with our wine/beer! Those strange tiny hands live here everyone!!! Idk why but u have accumulated like 6 of them during my course of living on Mill lol. I wish you guys sold hard alc but completely understand why you would stick to just beer and wine. Friendly staff as well! Cheers

I rented 2 books for an online class then next day decided to drop the class so I come back to just return them and they tell me I had 4 days from when the class started to return the books... I didn't even buy the textbooks until like a week after he class started lol... Terrible return policies and unhelpful customer service. Hadn't even opened the books and they wouldn't give me a refund...

Hadn't even opened the books and they wouldn't give me a refund... Update: Went back for the third time and this time reviewed the policy with the manager. She was left without much explanation when seeing that the return date was months before the class had even started... I ask how that makes any sense and she says nothing... No written policy about the almighty 4 days after the class started to refund like every employee told me.   Take my books and my $42 Student Book Center and best believe I'll be renting and buying from the homie Amazon from now on.

Blancos has the best tacos in town!!! Almost am content with only ever getting their award winning Bar-B-Q pulled pork tacos every time I go there. Perfect date restaurant! Just make sure if it's a weekend night you call for reservations because it gets packed!

Okay wow this place is cute and makes an amazing veggie sandwich that even me, a hearty meat eater, can get full off of! The Naughty Nurse is jam packed with a combination of veggies and sauces that go very well with the crispy wheat bread it comes on. I suggest getting the pasta salad for a side! This was the perfect lunch break spot AND they have the coolest store that sells everywhere from farmers market type food to stuff you would see in the apartment section of urban outfitters!

If u r drunk on lemon st., because let's face it who isn't, you must slop into El P for that monstrous caifornia burrito. Your drunk self will thank you for that.

Do you even go to ASU if you have eaten at Ncounter a shameful amount of times??? I've probably tried most of their menu and I gotta tell you... It really is all so good. #1 in my heart is always gonna be the loaded omelet but since that's a very aggressive breakfast I usually just get the simple two eggs, sourdough, and sausage or bacon with potatoes. The most perfect breakfast potatoes you've ever had!! And for lunch you must get the chicken focaccia sandwich! Staff is always so nice and food comes out in a timely manner :) love you Ncounter

Best to shop in town!! Fuzzy's is an ASU must-try, especially on Taco Tuesday's. California Heat Shrimp Taco is literally so amazing. Three tacos and a margarita (the sun devilrita is bomb) is the perfect food and drink combo. Bring your crew here to get a lil more than tipsy and a lot more than a satisfied tummy :)

I am such a meat eater so this means a lot that I am giving a vegetarian restaurant 5 stars... Or a review at all!! But wow bravo to Green for creating a vibrant menu with a large range of dishes that actually interest people other than just vegetarians!! I've gotten the Big Wac two times already because it literally tastes exactly like a Big Mac... Like you ACTUALLY feel full afterwards it's crazy!! Helped me nurse a wild hangover! The environment is so welcoming and aesthetically pleasing :) only criticism is that it's a tad bit too nippy inside! I will be a returning customer, see you soon Green!

The chipotle of enchiladas... This idea could've gone one of two ways and it definitely went the successful way! Has a definite lunch rush so try and get there early! This place is a must try!

Get the buckets and the crazy burritos! Great place to Sunday Funday but at night or on slow times the place has a strange crowd of townies with dogs lol But bring a crew and get a round or 3 of buckets and it's like they're not even there!

What a hot little spot they got going on here! Great diverse menu along with an amazing environment. I had the Bernie's Mac n Cheese and my date had the Original Chopped Salad and wow they were both delicious! I suggest the Mac n Cheese if you're looking for a rich and creamy dish and then the Chopped Salad if you're looking for something on the lighter side.

That gyros sandwich was a disgrace to all things sandwich. If you're not going to make legit gyros and not have them pre shaven (way too thick) like your subway than don't even try to make a gyro sandwich!!! Gyros don't deserve this!!!!!

Decent taco restaurant with fun margaritas and nachos as a starter. Little slow on the service, our starter came out before our drinks and they forgot one of my tacos. Food is delicious though!

Service is really good and in the colorful Roosevelt Row District. I gave 4 stars and not 5 because to be honest, this place didn't knock my socks off. I also really really like their menu, concept, and atmosphere. This is a great spot for your lunch break! I had the Mac daddy that has a hotdog, chili, and Mac n cheese along with the German potato salad that was surprisingly more stand outish than the hot dog!

Five star. 100%. My stomach is so happy. If any of you have been to Bodega Tacos in Miami Beach I would compare this to that (which is a rly rly rly good thing) They are very very authentic and have about 12 different meat options ranging from not spicy at all to very very spicy! I like it somewhere in the middle so got the Tinga, Asada, Pastor large tacos which perfectly filled my very hungry stomach! This place is pretty deep into North Phoenix, they have moved from the Central Phoenix location and look as if they are still building up the interior of the new spot! Highly recommend though! And this is from an AVID taco enthusiast!

Always love Postinos. Harper Sawicki is the best employee in the entire world. Gotta have that famous bruschetta (pesto, salmon, mozzarella, fig,are bomb) and their soup and salad duos are perfectly portioned. Great date night place!

Ok AMAZING food and drinks but that was some of the worst service I've ever had. It took us 20 minutes to get chips and salsa... Even with that said I still would go back for those tacos over and over again. The watermelon mint margarita is so yummy but small for then price.

Warning: no sourdough!!! Great place for breakfast. A little loud but the perfectly crispy bacon makes up for it. The lobster benedict is great if you're very hungry, the regular egg, bacon, and toast breakfast is good for a regular sized portion.

Ay this place is the most genius idea. Every kind of pasta dish from any country imaginable. And if it's not on the menu you can ask for it customized. The penne rosa is amazing! Very caloric but like its pasta so it's whatever. Their rice crispy treats are delicious!

My tummy is so happy!!! Flower Child is the perfect lunch spot in Uptown Phoenix. When I came in it was packed and I thought my food was going to take forever but it didn't! The Mother Earth bowl is crazy delicious and filling. The Mac n Cheese is utterly to die for I wish I could bathe in it!!! It's very very very noisy from the kitchen and the crowd but there is a beautiful outside patio to make up for it!

Shake Shack you better feel special to always be compared to in n out!!! Not sure if I would say shake shack is better than in n out yet but it's definite comparable. The fact that they have alcohol is always a plus for me.. I see big things for this chain.. Good job guys!

Aright I must say..... I'm from California and have very high standards for my poke bowls. I must swallow my poke snobbish outlook that all seafood eaten not by the ocean is bad. They've done it at AhiPoki Bowl. It's fresh, the tuna is PINK (which is how it should be!!), and the topping options are just what people look for in a poke bowl. The Tuna Luna and the plain Tuna mix well together in the bowl, but I can't wait to try the other fish options they offer! They ONLY thing I have to complain about is that when I asked for a poke bowl I didn't know there was a small and a large options and the employee didn't enlighten me on that option and just gave me a small. The small is perfect for a light lunch but I was feelin a pretty hefty dinner at the moment and wish I got the option explained to me so I could chose the larger one. Safe to say I'm coming back here again, and again, and again! (WAY better than Diego Pops sad excuse for a Poke Bowl)
