Thai Iced Tea, Pad-Thai & Chicken Satay.  A trifecta of flavor goodness.  A great place to go for lunch because its right in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  Yay!

The food here ROCKS!  I was a bit doubtful at 1st because this is a Kosher restaurant.  But I was hooked at 1st bite.  I've only had the chance to try a few of the dishes here, but it has all been very good.  The "garlic knots" a MUST.  The staff is super cool and very nice as well.  The complete dining experience.  I can't wait to get back there soon.

I recently moved and just started going to this location.  As I am a creature of habit, I resisted going and kept going out of my way to my old hair stylist that had been cutting my hair of the last 5 years. So, I finally broke down and decided to give this place a try. I a pleased to say that the stylists here are very friendly and most importantly, can cut hair very well. I have gotten my hair cut here a few times now, and have yet to be disappointed.

I've read so many good reviews about this place and its close to where I work, so I thought I'd try it out.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  I felt that the food was so-so and restaurant was dingy and sticky.  Normally I wouldn't care about the later, because the "dive-y" places are usually the best. Not in this case. . .  The only reason I went back a 2nd time is because I thought that maybe I just ordered the wrong dish or that they were having an off day, because of all the great reviews.  I tried, but unfortunately for me, the same thing happened on my next visit.  I just wasn't impressed.  Sadly, I don't think I'll be giving Maxim a "3rd time's the charm" chance.

After months of trying to go here, I finally did.  I must day, it was worth the wait.  The chicken sandwich that I had was had a pesto-mayo that was fantastic, and the chicken itself was cooked perfectly.  Wash it down with an ice cold beer and you've got the makings for a good Sunday afternoon.

I went to this place after seeing a segment on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (Food Network).  I thought that the fusion of Chinese & Mexican food would be good.  I was a bit disapointed.  The food was okay, but nothing too special.  The establishment itself was clean and the service was quick, so kudos to them for that.

Just found this place a few months ago.  It's pretty neat.  Trendy and casual all at the same time.  They play good music and have great specials,.  Buy one 22oz Kirin and get an appetizer for $.99!  Crazy, I know!  The best part . . . the Sushi is pretty good too.  Great place to go, especially if you are work on getting your "Sushi-Sensei" badge.  :-)

I must say, I do like this place!  Not much on atmosphere, but the food makes up for it.  They offer both traditional and americanized dishes.  I've tried several of their dishes and I have yet to be dispointed.  I think that their Orange Beef dish is my favorite.

The Amazing Jonathan show was great, but the Harmon Theatre should be renamed the "Harlem" Theatre.  The building, both inside and out are pretty ghetto.  They try to make it appear upscale, but it doesn't work.  Overall, the place is just rundown and dirty.  :-(  As far as I'm concerned, the only thing keeping that place together is tape / glue, and the only thing keeping it open is the Amazing Jonathan Show!

I have been using Joe Maggiore for the past year to manage my rental home in the East Valley.    It was the 1st time that I had ever worked with a property manager, as I had always done it by myself.  From the start, Joe was very hands on and involved.  He takes care of everything for me, tenant relations, maintenance and repair of my home and it's appliances, landscaping needs, HOA dues, etc.    I receive monthly updates about my rental, so I am always kept in the loop as to what is going on, never leaving me with questions.  Joe Maggiore truly provides me with COMPLETE property management service.  I have been so pleased with the service that Joe has provided, that I will be looking to use his services as my Property Manager and as my Realtor for the next rental property that I will be looking to purchase in the spring.
