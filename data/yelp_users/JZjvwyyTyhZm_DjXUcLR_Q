We were looking for a place to stop while pulling a RV trailer. This was the perfect place, it has a large parking lot for RVs and it turns out the food and service was great too. Didn't get around to trying their pies we were too full!

Clean facility, friendly staff, I have been here a several times (the price of having three kids) and have always been happy with the doctors they have had on staff, although I have never seen the same one twice. It is close to my home and I find it much better than having to go the Emergency Room and better hours than my doctor. They are open from 8 am to 8 pm week days, 8 am til 6 pm and they can do x-rays.

I have been here twice once when it first opened. At the average cost of $14.00 a head we ate off the cardboard plates and were put off, although the food wasn't bad, but not at all spicy. I thought I would give it a second try. This time I did a takeout - I ordered two chicken Tikka Masalas medium spice  and a tandoori chicken for a friend who does not like curry - rice came with all three dishes and we ordered Naan breads too. The masala have 10 small chucks of chicken in them in a pale yellow fairly bland sauce and the tandoori chicken which should be dry was served with peppers and onion fry with a chili paste which they then coated the chicken with! Most of it got thrown away. I did return one masala which they gave me store credit for ($10.95) with two explanations - One, each chef has a variation on how they cook the dishes (our chef had decided that tomatoes shouldn't be a part of our tomato based curry).  Two, for our American customers we tell them not too cook it spicy! Sorry Bay Leaf Owners, but in my opinion consistency is an important part of running a restaurant

We had a wonderful birthday celebration meal there, everyone's meal was delicious. We did have trouble seeing the interior and reading the menus as it was so dark in there.
