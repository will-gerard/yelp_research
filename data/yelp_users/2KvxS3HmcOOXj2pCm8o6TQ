The shop doesn't look like much on the outside but they have a lot of wedding dresses to choose from.  They also have a lot of "off the rack" dresses that you can purchase.  I wasn't planning on buying a dress the day I went in.  It was more of a "let's stop there and look and see what they have" situation.  Well, they were having a sale on the "off the rack" dresses which were "name your own price".  I was also able to try them on, and I didn't even have an appointment!  The staff was really friendly and I'd definitely recommend them.

Simply the best pizza I have ever tasted. It's all about their pizza sauce. It is amazing and it doesn't get any better than this. Granted the restaurant has been under construction for what seems like an eternity and it looks more like an old abandoned warehouse rather than a restaurant, however, their pizza is unlike anything I have ever tasted.   Yum!

So maybe the customer service isn't all that bubbly but when you step into "The Horny Toad" you are stepping back in time when customer service was mediocre at best, right?  So with that said, the food is what we really need to focus on and it's delicious!  They have the best cottage cheese that I've ever had and their potato salad is amazing.  Also, their tangy and sweet BBQ sauce is perfection.  Love the ambiance and the old western feel... definitely worth the drive.

Oh how I love their croissants!  They are so fresh and delicious.  I've never actually tried their baguettes because I love their croissants too much to stray away from them.  The sandwiches are large and very inexpensive.  They have a great drink menu as well.   My only complaint is that they only take cash.  :(

Oh so very bad! We wound up here after our attempt to eat at San Tan Flats on a Friday night turned out to be a forty five minute wait. So this establishment looked inviting on the outside but the inside was a different story. I ordered their special of the night, which was their fish and chips. To my surprise it also came with Clam Chowder soup. This was horribly disappointing. The taste was rather bland and the surprise crunch of leftover shell in my soup was not a delight surprise. Furthermore, the fish and chips were a greasy hot mess and the french fries were a bit average. I seemed to enjoy the store bought bread roll the most. Bottom-line: never eat here. Blah... oh, and I got the worst stomach ache after this meal.

I like this store so much so that I've decided to Yelp about it. Yes, that's right, I'm Yelping about Bashas.  : P   This particular store is great.  First off, they provide plenty of covered parking spaces which is great during those Arizona summers and they're always so freaking friendly here!  I guess I love this store so much because their setup makes sense, it's never too busy (which could also be a bad thing, but I hate shopping when it's uber busy), and I've never had a bad customer service experience here.  The deli is clean and their lunchmeat is always so fresh.  They'll also cook a pizza for you while you shop, which, by the way, is pretty good pizza for a grocery store.    Bottomline, I'm glad that you are in my neighborhood Bashas... just don't go closing on me now!

I go here for lunch sometimes and I always have a great experience. The food is amazing and it's a fun environment . It's something different and unique. They have picnic tables outside with large trees that provide lots of shade. Also, I love their Sweet Potato fries!

Went to the Old Town Farmers Market in Snobsdale this morning and had a great time! Not only was there a Yelp stand there giving away free reusable tote bags, I filled up my new reusable tote bag with lots of goodies!   I bought some jalapeno cheese bread which was really fresh and tasty. I also broke down and bought some mango salsa at $9.99 a jar.. I know! But it's hard to find a good mango salsa! I also had a breakfast burrito which I definitely recommend.

Bluburger Grille, it's really blue inside and out. I am a fan of this establishment because their ingredients are fresh and delicious. I chose the option to build my own burger and I was completely satisfied with my creation. I chose to create a portobello mushroom burger which I had never had before but I thoroughly enjoyed. They also serve sweet potato fries which is an extra bonus.

I'll admit it, I was a little skeptical about a park built atop a former landfill but it's actually a great idea! Not only are there breathtaking views of the valley, they have some really cool activities like disc golf and archery.   Everything is made from recycled materials and there's even a Garbage Sculpture Garden!  Weird, right?  Well, I thought the best part of the whole park was the large dog park as I am an avid dog lover.  Great job Chandler!

This is the worst Del Taco location.  I have visited this location on multiple occasions and the food is always terrible here.  The service is awful too!  On one occasion, I went through the drive thru, waited for the car in front of me to get their food (which took forever) and when I pulled up to the speaker, no one greeted me or took my order because there was no one working the drive thru!  It was the middle of the day... Epic fail!

I saw this restaurant on "Check Please" which is a local show on Channel 8 which reviews 3 restaurants on every episode. The food looked really good and I love restaurants with a nice patio and a lot of history, so I thought this place would be a hit. We went there for brunch and the patio was really nice with a great view of Cammelback Mountain. The food was the biggest disappointment. The prices are really high, which I don't mind if the food is worth the price, yet that wasn't the case here. I had the Cobb Salad and the chicken was cold and it was just okay. I was expecting more out of a $15 salad. (FYI - Charleston's Cobb Salad is a-mazing and cheaper!) They also give you a "bread" basket before your entrees come out, and it's more like a "dessert" basket which is cool but the scones and sticky buns were just okay. My fiance had a breakfast burrito which was huge but it wasn't anything to get excited about. Our waiter was pretty stale too... and it had the pretentious Scottsdale vibe to it.

I always go to Starbucks but never write reviews for them because they are everywhere, however, this particular Starbucks location was so professional and friendly that I wanted to yelp about it.  It seems rare these days to find great customer service and my vanilla skinny latte was delicious.
