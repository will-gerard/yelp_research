Lynn does a great job and gives the best pedicure in town!! I have been a loyal customer for 5 years and would recommend them to anyone. My 8 year old son even comes in to have his nails and toenails cut!

Food is ok but they keep selling groupons and then have 1000 restrictions so you can never use them. Not very honorable

I have always been a fan of this place but last night the service was just terrible. Our waiter Michael was slow and inattentive, some food was overlooked. And the manager was not al that helpful or sympathetic. Hoping it was just an off night, but not wanting to go back for another bad experience.

Best threading, facials, and waxing around!! The threading will not irritate your skin even if it is sensitive

Waitress was nice but the service overall was slow, food was sub-par and loaded with salt.
