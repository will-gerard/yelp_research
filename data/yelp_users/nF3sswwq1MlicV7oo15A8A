I just returned today from a 10 day vacation only to arrive at the airport parking garage and find I had a flat tire.  Not a great way to end a vacation. I set to work putting on the spare and pondered my next move.  With a family of four, way too much luggage and a strong desire to get things fixed quickly, I decided to call Wheel Specialists, Inc.  I have previously done business there and was very happy with service and results.  Today, once again, they did not disappoint.    Now, I realize that fixing flats is not what keeps them in business but they were on the way home and it was an easy solution.  I called from the airport and they immediately began getting all of the necessary information to make the repair.  They were very polite and eager to please.  When I arrived at their facility, I was greeted immediately as I stepped out of the vehicle.  They had the paperwork in hand and took my vehicle in immediately.  15 minutes later I was out the door and on my way.  They had taken all of my luggage out of the car, returned the jack and spare to their proper place and re-loaded the car.  Nice work boys!  I don't write many reviews but I felt that I needed to make an exception this time for what I deem to be exceptional service. This business is a notch above its competitors. I give Wheel Specialists, Inc. my highest recommendation!

Good wings and cold beer. The rest of the food and the service was horrible.

Can you give zero stars?  If so, I would have to consider it. Let's start with the good. The beer was ice cold. That sums up the good, here's the rest. I was with a group of 13 in Las Vegas on business and staying at the Monte Carlo. We were seated promptly in a private room that must have been so private the waiters had trouble finding it. We had to track the waiter down to place our order after 45 minutes of waiting. Should have been a sign. I ordered the prime sirloin and it was repulsive. I can't describe the taste other than to say if you took rancid meat, threw it in the grill for 5 minutes and then served it you would be close. I had order medium and got raw. It wasn't the fact that it wasn't cooked right but the taste that was such a turn off.  When I complained they asked if I would like to try something else so I tried Lasagna. Big thick noodles with little to no filling in between. Bad!  When it was time to leave we had to track the waiter down to get the check. No, they didn't take the steak off and there was no visit from the manager apologizing. Don't go here. I won't ever again.

I have to say that I had a great experience with these guys. I called at approximately 1:30 on Thursday afternoon and got their answering service. They took my information and said someone would contact me shortly. Two minutes later I received a call. We talked about my refrigerator and what might be the problem and some pricing and I gave them the go ahead to come over. I kid you not, they were there within 10 minutes. He quickly fixed the issue (a fried computer board) and was on his way. Total time from first call to job completion was no more than 40 minutes. The tech happened to be close by so you may not be so lucky, but it worked well for me. Highly recommended!

Stopped by at 7 this morning to grab a breakfast burrito for my son only to realize they don't open until 8 on Saturdays. The owner saw me and was kind enough to whip the burrito up for me. Greatly appreciated.

Are lunch there today. Food was very good and served quickly and the owners young boys were there hustling around cleaning tables, suggesting different sauces and getting drink refills. A bit off the beaten path but worth the stop

We have been looking forward to this location opening for quite some time. We had eaten at the Downtown Phoenix location and it was delicious. It probably wasn't a good idea to eat here on their first Friday after opening though. When I called in I was told it would be about an hour and twenty minutes for our party of 8. When we showed up 1:15 into the wait we were told it would be another 67 minutes. After a conversation with an understanding and appreciative Manager we were seated in about 10 minutes. I'm a happy camper. The food was delicious!  Their meatballs are fantastic as is the Calamari and Shrimp appetizer. The Pizza though, that will keep you coming back. Enjoy but beware of crowds.
