Yes, the green chile is very good. But the long wait can be difficult to bear and the burritos are approaching $6 a piece.   With that being said this is some of the best green chile I have had in Phoenix. It is mildly spicy with fresh onions and tomatoes, and lean chunks of tender pork. I certainly appreciate that the meat is not accompanied by layers of fat, which I have experienced at other valley eateries. I must confess. I love me some tasty pig and this slightly-too-thin sauce is just squealing for more. Nearly double would be about right.   Rito's also needs to add some combo plates to that barren menu. Give me a green chile plate with rice, beans, and flour tortillas for a bit more than a solo burrito and I will repeatedly frequent your establishment. Currently if you'd like some rice and beans with your burro you're lookin' at $8 plus for your lunch. This is not Scottsdale! Some claim that this place has "the best" beans. I disagree. They are a bit too salty and runny. On the other hand the rice is simple and satisfying. Also, while not made in-house and instead purchased from Mama Lola's, the tortillas are still quite good.   In a nutshell visit Rito's if you appreciate some tasty green chile and have lots of time to spare and patience to endure the long line and longer wait. I would recommend going early or late to avoid the lunch rush.

Firstly, this is Arizona turn the air conditiioning on! Normally I am not big on atmosphere, but when its 80 degrees plus outside, I expect a comfortable temperature. I had to sit outside since the inside was stuffy, and the black curtains did not do my comfort level any justice.   Now that I am done ranting a bit, lets get on to the food. At this point, unfortunately, it does not get any better. We ordered the Pasteles, a tamale with pork, plantains, raisins, and spices, for an appetizer, and it was not that great. The masa was a bit dry, and the flavors weren't as scintillating as I expected, especially for the price.   For our entrees we had the Ropa Veija (shredded beef in spices with black beans and rice), which once again was not anything spectacular. This was the highlight of the meal, which to me is sad. The beef was a bit tough and the moros (rice and black beans mixed) was dry. Sadly, our other entree was much worse. This title is held by the Pollo Cubano (marinated chicken breast with onions). The chicken was tender on the bright side, but it was covered with onions that were disgustingly soaked in lime. The flavor was overwhelming and I could taste nothing other than lime.   Considering the price, atmosphere, and quality of Havana Cafe's food I will never return. If you must try this restaurant, I ask you to please not order the items mentioned above.

I'd like to start by saying that anyone who rates Azteca as three-star or lower is either a damn fool, or is not well versed in Mexican food. You know who you are.  This is about as it good as it gets for the Phoenix area. Everything is homemade and delicious.  The green corn tamales are absolutely stellar. This beauty comes out wrapped in waxed paper and corn husk to maintain the moisture and heat. It's like unwrapping presents at Christmas time, a pure delight! Top this bad boy with green sauce and dive in to find kernels of corn complemented by the perfect sweetness. The green chile is also superb and highly recommended.   The staples even stand on their own. Your meal begins with crispy chips fresh out the fryer! Throw a little salt and green sauce on them and enjoy. The consistency and flavor of the beans is just right and they are not offensively overwhelmed with cheese as so many other restaurants. The rice always has great flavor, but can range in moisture from slightly dry to very moist depending on the day (I'm assuming different cooks.) And lastly the flour tortillas. These goodies are concealed by foil to keep them piping hot. Every time I unwrap them I get a little giddy. The smell is just so damn good! There are few things better than flour tortillas with rice and beans. This is just about the best threesome I have ever had.   The only downside to Azteca is the limited daytime hours, and the large lunch crowds. If you love Mexican food, and have not eaten here you must make it a point to come. You will NOT be disappointed. I almost forgot it is also very inexpensive with most of the combos ranging from $5-6ish.

After reading some of the less than stellar reviews I feel obligated to review one of the best Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale. Even if it isn't exactly an authentic representation of the traditional variety.   The staples here are excellent. The chips are fresh and a bit heartier than most. They are, indeed... delicious. The red salsa is of mild-to-medium heat and complements their companions well. The beans are also very tasty, not refried and smothered in cheese like some well-known offenders. The rice is tender and flavorful. Together with some fresh flour tortillas and you experience what is know as harmony.   The chicken mole enchiladas are easily my favorite dish here, with the mole being slightly sweet and mildly spiced. The hard tacos here can be a bit greasy, which I admittedly enjoy on occasion. The red enchilada sauce is pretty decent as well. I think I have also had the tamales here, but do not remember them standing out.  It's a pretty cool spot too with a patio and bar out back. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. Sure, you can get better elsewhere in the valley, but Frank and Lupe's is always a solid choice.

When I lived in Scottsdale this was my go-to Mexican spot. This, along with Los Favoritos, are hands-down the best taquerias Scottsdale has to offer. Whenever I visit these locales I am not looking for some exotic dish or specialties and typically stick to carne asada and breakfast burritos. Fiesta Burrito excels at both. Their beans, tortillas, and green sauce are pretty tasty as well. The rice is pretty standard and just okay. Whether you are looking to satisfy your Mexi-cravings or drunk as a mutha-fuckin' skunk, hit it up! They won't let you down.  Just a note: For all you whiteys (myself included) and transplants who praise the bland, sad-excuse-for-Sonoran-fare of Macayo's, Ajo Als, and the like or the valley's unfortunate taqueria staple, Filibertos, please try this place or Los Favs. You will thank me later.

This place is the definition of a mom and pop restaurant. Their whole family runs this place. They are very friendly and accommodating, they will take care you. Plus this is the only Polish food I've been able to locate, aside from Stanley's who specilizes in sausages.   The restaurant is located on a quiet street in Downtown Glendale. There is a patio with trees towering overhead. It makes for a very peaceful lunch, and for a moment almost makes you forget you're in a blistering desert. They do have limited hours so make sure you call ahead of time.   I have been here twice, and both times were excellent. My friend's mom (who is Polish) made me Pierogi when I was young, and ever since I've been hooked. I had both the potato and cheese and the meat Pierogi. Altough I prefer a little more butter and onion with my Pierogi they were still delicious and cooked perfectly. Next, I had to Golabki (stuffed cabbage) which was even better than the Pierogi. They were moist and filled with plenty of flavorful meat, and topped with a sweet and tangy tomato sauce. The Goulash is also amazing, but I can't go into detail on this one since I had it on my first visit.   I highly recommend A Touch of European Cafe. I wish I didn't live so far from this place! Its rare that I get to fulfill my Polish cravings.

I had a hard time giving this place even two stars. I know La Perla has been in Glendale for 60 years or so, and I sure as hell don't know why! I ordered the Chicken Mole and this was by far the worst mole I have ever had. It was very thin, and a light brown. The flavor nor the consistency were even close. The chicken was on the bone, and the fatty skin was still on. The rice was OK, but the beans tasted like they came straight out of can. The one, somewhat redeeming factor of my meal was the tortilla. It was pretty good, but still a little dry.  My mom ordered a combination plate with a shredded beef enchilada with green chile sauce, a red tamale, and a ground beef taco. The enchilada was actually good, and definitely the best thing we had there. The tamale was decent. The taco was terrible, whatever they call ground beef seemed to be some sort of unrecognizable mush. Most closely related to dog food. Shit, I don't think I would even feed it to my dog.   Overall, this was a disappointing experience. I cannot recommend La Perla. Its too bad Lily's closed down. It was by far the best Mexican food in the Downtown Glendale area (as far as I know.)

After seeing Restaurant Mexico voted as the "Best Neighborhood Mexican Restaurant in Tempe" in the New Times: Best of Phoenix, I decided to give it a try.   I ordered tomatillo chicken enchiladas, with rice and beans, and a side order of flour tortillas. The entire meal was scrumptious. Immediately after receiving the flour tortillas, which smelled so fresh, I knew I was in for a treat. Apparently they purchase the tortillas from an undisclosed location in South Phoenix, and they were top notch. Next we move on to the beans; they were smooth and thin, with just the right amount of salt. The rice was moist and had a great flavor. Lastly, the chicken enchiladas are sure to excite the taste buds with a spicy tomatillo sauce.   Not only is the food delicious, but it is cheap too! Most entrees are $10 or less, which is shocking considering it is on Mill Ave. My expectations were surely surpassed, and I left Restaurant Mexico a fat and happy man.

Let me start by saying this restaurant is way too expensive. BBQ is supposed to be cheap and dirty. With this being said the lunch prices are reasonable. The BBQ sampler with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork with one side ran about $14. The ribs were definitely the standout of the meal. They came off the bone clean, were very tender, and had a nice smoky flavor. The pulled pork rivaled the ribs, and may have actually surpassed them in taste. The brisket was tender, but was lacking the flavor of the other two meats. It also seemed a little off in color as it was as it was much lighter than most I have had. Mac n' cheese was my choice of side and it was deliciously cheesy. I could devour bowl after bowl of that goodness. Also worth a mention is the donut they bring you after your meal. That thing, albeit small, was fresh out of the fryer, covered in sugary sweetness and an unexpectedly nice ending to a solid meal.

The tacos at this place are little bundles of goodness that are damn near perfection. To begin the carne asada has great flavor with a slightly charred and crispy exterior, but still manages to maintain some tenderness on the inside. The cabbage, guacamole, and salsa are a necessary addition to this masterpiece of a taco. And just when you think you have it all... bam! Grilled onions complete one of the best tacos in Phoenix. On top of it all, these bad boys are only $1 a piece.   Now on to the less glamorous side of Taqueria Los Yaquis, or the underbelly if you will. The establishment is inconspicuously housed just west of 7th Ave on Camelback Rd under a tent with some plastic tables and sporadic misters outside of Charlies gay bar. Here you will find some flaming fairies and hordes of legit Mexicans flocking in from all angles. Once you reach your destination you can watch the cooks working tirelessly in a food truck (one of the cleanest I've seen) to prepare you meat-filled pockets of love. God bless them.   There are two ordering lines: one is literally a hole-in-the-wall inside Charlie's and the other a general line outside which accommodates all. This dual line and alternating order-taking results in ridiculously long waits of up to 20-30 minutes. I prefer to go on Sunday afternoons when it gets real, and a lil' less... uh... gay.

I normally don't review a restaurant after one visit, but this place is just that good. Had the pesto chicken crepe and the Heart drip coffee. Those go together right? I had the coffee because it is free when you check in on Yelp (you can also choose tea.) The crepe, as you can see in the pics, was perfectly cooked. Thin, delicate, and slightly browned. The most prominent flavor was the cheddar cheese. My only critique would be that it could use more pesto, but it was still damn good. Also, the Heart (based out of Portland, OR) coffee was delicious and was a medium brew with a light oily layer.   The atmosphere may be just as fine as the food. The music was great and playing from an employee's iPod. I heard the Beatles, Gene Chandler, and Fela Kuti, a pioneer of Afrobeat music, among others. The wall art and friendly faces were courtesy of Andy Brown, who also did the murals on the Cabanas on McClintock in Tempe.   The staff was friendly and helpful. The price and portions are right. I'll be back and looking forward to trying their "sweet" crepes.

A great burger spot down the street from me. And they are open late night? Amazing! I welcome you, Hamburger Yumi Yum, to my hood, and please make an indefinite appearance.   The burgers here are deliciously fresh with a slight char and toasted sesame seed bun. The standard toppings are diced onions, tomatoes, and jalapenos complimented with mayo, mustard, and ketchup. The fries are simple, but quite possibly more enjoyable than the burger. You get a healthy serving and they are crisped and salted to perfection. Not only do they have great food, but the owner Rosario is a great hostess and accommodates her guests.  My recommendation is to eat there (despite the delightful landscape of 16th St) or better yet head into the Royale and grab a beer with your burger. Either way this shit is bomb fresh off the grill, get it while it's hot. Fast-food burger spots can suck it, I'm gonna get me a $5 combo at Yumi Yum (minus the high fructose corn syrup)!

I'd like to start by thanking "Local First Arizona" and "Culinary Dropout" for throwing a great (and free) grand opening party!   For our appetizer we chose the Burrata which is a mixture of mozzarella and cream. It had a very mild flavor and a texture similar to ricotta, but slightly creamier. It was served with a grilled bread, diced pears, and chopped walnuts then drizzled with a bacon syrup.  I was not overwhelmed with this dish, and would have preferred a healthier serving a pears and more sauce to add additional sweetness.   The entrees for the evening were the pork ribs and trout. The meat on the ribs was plentiful and tender and sure to satisfy the greatest of carnivores. Although, the standout of the dish was the barbecue sauce. It was deliciously spicy and sweet, finger-lickin' good. Barely worth mentioning were the lackluster fries and coleslaw. Both were just passable and definitely expected more considering the price of the dishes.  I have mixed feelings about the trout. It looked rather lonely on the plate, with a dense line of green beans and almonds accompanying it. It was slightly overcooked, with one side being nearly perfect and tender, while the other was slightly crispy and just a bit dry. This being said it was still quite edible and the buttery sauce accented the filet nicely.  We finished the meal with the cinnamon apple brioche and vanilla gelato. The brioche was served in a cool mini cast iron pan. It seemed to be immersed in cinnamon and sugar, and just far too sweet. The gelato was just okay and was one small sad scoop. Not too much flavor or sweetness here, and that may be a good thing. The brioche was definitely begging for a bit of mellow.   Lastly, we enjoyed a couple cocktails as well. I had the El Matador and the Smashed Irishman. While I almost exclusively drink beer, these drinks were excellent and I would happily order them again. Both seemed to have nearly the perfect balance of sweetness, bitterness, and alcohol. My favorite of the two would have to be the El Matador as I am partial to tequila. If the meal were not comped our bill would have been exactly $100 (excluding tax and tip.)  Almost forgot to mention the venue, which may be the most appealing factor of all. It has a massive covered patio with modern decor, trees dispersed throughout, very nice heaters, and an assortment of games which included ping pong, cornhole, foosball, and shuffleboard. I could definitely see myself going back, brown baggin' it (the beer special) and playing some drunken games. Get it!
