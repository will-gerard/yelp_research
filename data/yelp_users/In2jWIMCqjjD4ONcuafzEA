As a mortgage loan officer, I have a front row seat to the services David offers.    He is a skilled Realtor who has all it takes to give great results for buyers or seller.  Character, acumen and experience coupled with a great personality to be around.

Fantastic everything.  Fair price.  Smart diagnosis.   They didn't try to up sell.   They got to the work quickly.  In and out in a day during June on a major job.  Taught me how to run it. Friendly.  Clean.  Again, fantastic everything.

Great Gazpacho!  And this is the best burger in the area and we have 10 gourmet burger restaurants within 2 miles of here.

We have eaten at Sauce dozens of times over the years.   The service has always been great.  But in the last few months, the food, service and overall management has been horrible.  Not sure what caused the wheels to fall off.  But we have experienced the issues in 3 of their locations.  Too many other great places to go.

This place is excellent in every way.  You can tell they know what they are doing.  Service, ambiance and incredible food.  Unique but not weird.   Can't wait to come back.

I have referred literally dozens of friends and family to the Gluch Group to help them buy and sell real estate in the Phoenix area. I have worked with lots of realtors over the years and none surpass this team in the level of service and expertise they provide. These days being good at your job, while important, isn't enough. I want to send friends to organizations that go above and beyond to create amazing customer experiences and treat people like Vip's. The Gluch  Group does that and more. Check these guys out!

Fantastic everything. Food is unique.   Like you've never had.   But in a good way.   Love the attitude of everyone there.

Awesome experience.  We'll run, clean.  Everything works.   This place will continue to be where I go to get a great wash at a great price.

What a train wreck.   Constant attempts to up sell.     Borderline trickery.   You have to pay attention to avoid getting scammed.   Lack of attention to detail.  My rims were not even wiped.  There is no management watching these shortcomings.
