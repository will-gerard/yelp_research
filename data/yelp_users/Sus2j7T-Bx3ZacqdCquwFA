Food isn't bad, but the service SUCKS! never got a drink refill and it took 20mi to get change. Then found out the server was carrying it with her the whole time.. She just forgot. I may just forget to come back until they get new servers. Not only was she slow, she was insulting. Not my idea of a fun time.

I usually never change my review...so this is a first.  After giving this place a very honest review (not favorable) I had been contacted by the owner to come back.  He had said he had made a bunch of changes.  I refused, and wished him luck.  As it turns out my friends go there A LOT and drug me in there one night.  Our service was amazing...and fast.  Everyone there was so wonderful, I felt bad about my previous review.  I wondered if the great experience was because my friends go all the time, and it was just them that were getting great service.  I went with my hubby a few days later.  Our server was beyond amazing.  I told him I have some food allergies, and he was so great about it.  Our food came very fast, and just how we had ordered it.  There were a lot of people in that night, but our server still took the time to chat with us for a second.   We went back a THIRD time...still waiting for the prior bad experience to rear it's ugly head.  We had a different server...much to my surprise, she was amazing as well.  Not only was she great, our server from the last time saw us and made sure he said good bye to us.  I give the owner a big congrats on turning this place around.  It is now one of my favorite mexican food places in the area.  Congrats Juan Jamie's...you changed this stubborn girls mind!!!!

This place is really good! Yes the service is a touch slow, but once you know that... Grab a drink and enjoy the atmosphere. Every member of the staff was so kind, it was like we were at a friends house for dinner. My hubby can be a touch picky, and they asked a few times exactly how he wanted his food to make sure it was right. He had the chicken Alfredo, which he said was great. I had a lovely glass of wine and the seafood mixture (can't remember the exact name) it was amaze balls!  We will be back... And often. So glad we found this hidden gem.

Love this place. Food is amazing. Service is great. So glad to have another great place in Grayhawk.  I love that the sandwiches are served on a cutting board..something unique, and fun.  I ordered take-out one day, I was expecting the normal "take out" type presentation.  Cold food, warm salad...you know.  I was blown away!!  I opened my food, and aside from the cutting board, I felt like I had been served in the restaurant.  I have not had anything there that I wouldn't order again...wonderful food, great service...all around great!!  One of my new favorites!

I love this place! We bought two sofas from another place, came here for some outdoor furniture and found our sofas.. Exact same stuff,  for over $1,000 less. We used to go to American a lot when we lived in Denver,  and we're beyond thrilled they came to the Valley. This is the only place we get furniture.. Period! It's quality brands,  but WAAAYYYYY less than other stores. We live in North Scottsdale, and will make the drive here instead of going to the overpriced places up North. Amazing furniture plus killer prices... Yep, this is the place to go!

Been here a few times, each hoping the food would have improved. It hasn't. Cold fries, hockey puck burgers and REALLY bad coke. Come on, McDonald's is known for their diet coke, and these guys can't even get that right! I'm not sure how to make a diet coke take this bad. Anyway, this place needs a total overhaul. Their food, and service just flat suck.

Love this place. Hubby and I were wondering why we have never been here up till now. Their Chicago style pizza is well worth the wait!! It does take a touch longer, but order a drink and chill. Their staff was so nice, and accommodating. We went in when there was a big college game going on, and they had it on almost ever tv. Everyone in the bar was cheering, and having a blast. Even though there weren't many people at the late time we came in, the energy was amazing. We will be back...soon and often!!
