Overpriced, mediocre food and phony.  The wines are OK but somewhat pretentious.  If you want really good food and good wines, go up the street to Hillstone on Camelback.

Postino Arcadia was better than expected on a recent  visit.  On the way back home from the airport my friend and I decided to stop for a nosh and wine.  When we got there late afternoon, we were welcomed immediately and cheerfully and seated promptly.  As soon as were seated, one of the wait staff brought us water and took our order for a bottle of Caparza.   It was a lovely Italian, a fill bodied Sangiovese Tuscan but not as murky as a Chianti.  It was delicious from the first sip to the last drop.  If you like Italian reds, this is a really good one.                                                                                           We next ordered our food and my friend ordered the bruschetta, I wanted a panini and settled on the autostrada.  One of Postino's delights is to choose your favorites when ordering the bruschetta s there are some wonderful choiced. He ended up with the salmon, caprese, artichoke and the green apple toasts. Each one offers a unique blend of flavors and no one does it better than Postino.  The Autostrada panini has all the right meats and cheeses but I am not a fan of the arugula and tomato.  I took those off and added them to my side salad and took a bite.  Each bite took me back to a stop I made on the way from Naples to Salerno where I had a similar panini with such wonderful flavors.                                                                                                                  The food and wine would earn this wonderful restaurant five stars but the Postino service by committee is not my favorite.  It creates uneven service and no one seems totally responsible for your table.  Other than that, Postino continues to be a wonderful gem in the Arcadia neighborhood and highly recommended.  This was a great improvement from my last visit.

Phoenix has very few decent seafood restaurants and years ago, we found Taylor's Chowder House.  The place was packed with seniors and families at almost any time we landed there.  The owner was from Rochester and Boston and knew seafood as well as anyone.  The New England Clam Chowder was made from scratch, full of clams with potatoes in a sea of white sauce. The Best in Phoenix for years.  They also had specials every day based on what came in fresh that day, whether Tilapia, Mahi-mahi, halibut and haddock or fresh Maine lobsters all prepared well at great value.                                                                                                         Yesterday, we went back to Taylor's and what a difference.  The old owner turned the restaurant to his cook who sold it and took it back.  When the current owner was a cook, he prepared the food meticulously; nothing fancy but very good meals made from scratch.  This visit that night was so different.  I am on a restricted diet, so I often share a meal with my wife.  We had a hankerin' for fried haddock and recalled the long, fresh filets coated in batter and fried to a golden brown.  The meal came with waffle fries and cole slaw. So, we ordered the fried haddock dinner split with a bowl of their hearty New England Clam Chowda.  The waitress brought a loaf of bread that looked like it had been served over and over.  Needless to say, it just sat there. Next, she brought our drinks, a glass of decent house Pinot Grigio and an Arnold Palmer.  The lemonade mixed in with the ice tea had a metallic taste and was horrid.  The waitress did notice it sitting there and offered to replace it but likely no different from the first,  Next, she brought the bowl of the famed chowder that gave the restaurant it's name and reputation.  What I remembered was nothing like that.  It was awful.  The broth was too thick with a flour taste, few clams and heavily over salted; what a disappointment to start.  A few minutes later the waitress brought us the two plates that she had split the meal already so each of us had a smallish piece of haddock, some steak fries and dish of cole slaw.  It looked inviting, to be honest until we tasted the haddock.  Replacing the large fresh piece of haddock were two smaller pieces of frozen haddock.  We had hoped for a light flaky fish and what we got was clumps of fish meat in fried batter that was too long in the freezer, possibly not even haddock.  I had a small portion of the haddock but it was so awful, I could not eat any more. I thought I would try the slaw instead but again, not up to standards.  The dressing was very bland that no amount of salt and pepper could improve upon it,  The steak fries, however, were cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and meaty on the inside.  The fries were the only thing I ate.  This was such a disappointment that it is a shame of how far off our original visit it had come.   The highlights were the wine and steak fries,, plus the friendly sociable waitress.  We noticed how small the dining crowd was on a Friday night and most were very elderly. I felt we were in God's waiting room. This is another case of a cook with little restaurant management experience, in my humble opinion trying to make it work.  When the customers dropped off, he decided to lower his costs and cut corners.  Not much changed inside in 20 years except for the food.  We probably will never come back because of the disappointment of this experience.

Do not believe the hype.  You must go there and try it yourself.  The ingredients grown by the owner an the pizza dough is the best I have ever had.  The toppings are fresh full of flavor.  May be the best pizza ever.

If you cannot get into Pizza Bianco, come over to Cibo, or come to Cibo first and enjoy the great pizza, sandwiches, and soups made here. The ambiance here is great.  It occupies an old home built in the early 1900's and a patio that makes you feel like home. Went one Tuesday Pasta night which used to occur weekly and still does I hope and had the best pasta since my trip to Italy.  A hidden gem in downtown Phoenix.

To be fair, we went to Matt's based on the raveswe read on various sources.  Like the emperpr's new clothes, we fail to see what the hubbub is all about. I recently went to breakfast there and order a cheese omelet with home fries and wnet away hungry and very disappointed.  The home fries were mostly uncooked and badly seasoned,  The eggs were hard and disappointing and the toast was hard and cold.  This was very unsatisfactory and it is certain that Matt's Breakfast lives off its laurels and not the food.

On my last time there, we reserved the 8 top table for a birthday party and assured it would be ours.  I called over Peter who apologized because the day hostess set us up in the dining area, not the bar, in the front window.  I told Peter this was not acceptable and we want the table reserved,  Peter asked the four people occupying the 8 top and graciously picked up their tab.  Three of the four people were very gracious but one woman stayed behind and said some very rude things to me.  Finally she got up but highlighted her rudeness with her middle finger,  Both my wife and I saw that and pointed it out to Emina, our server for the night, that she flipped us off.  Later, I said to her that I would be bigger than her and pick up their tab when I found out the manager already took care of them.  Finally, were set up and our guests arrived.  Emina took great care of us and beverages started flowing.  The food was very good and we all shared plates, hence the reason why we wanted the eight top in the first place. The night was very enjoyable and the birthday party was a success,  Until..... the following Wednesday, the GM Bob called me on my cell phone and accused me of dropping the F word at the women that was rude to me.  I told him my side of the story when Bob seemingly took the women's side and accused me of bad manners.  The only part of the story he has was her side.  Of course, Bob had not interviewed all of the employees but decided to confront me first.  I told Bob that I had a witness that was by my side the whole time but he never interviewed her.  He hadn't bothered to talk to our server Emina, who could have cleared things up and he hadn't talked to the person that was with me.  After hearing all this, he said he will investigate further and get back to me.  I was so offended by his decision that I promised never to go back there.  My business partner and I entertained there every week with four or more friends and spent a great deal in the time we were customers.  Bob never called me back to tell me the results of his investigation, but again I talked to Peter who said no one actually heard me say the word at any time, but he never talked to my witness.  I told him that this defamation of character was the reason I wasn't coming back and his comment was "If I were you, I wouldn't come back either."  That capped it.  The restaurant management created the problem and decided to deflect onto their customer, me!  I never got an answer and at this stage, it doesn't matter.  Stay out of this location unless you go there periodically because if you become a "regular" you will be treated rudely as well.

If I could put less than one star, I would.  This place is vindictive and not worth spending any money in.  A month ago, I reported an encounter with a manager that complained of my comments about an employee that was rude and angry.  When I challenged his threat, my response was to walk away from a place where free speech was not allowed,  I wrote to the general manager but never got a reasonable response other than he would look into it.  I left there stating clearly that I would not go back there and wrote a negative review on YELP.   .   A week ago, I was approached on Facebook by an Assistant GM to come in and discuss my complaint.  We could not make it back from our vacation in time to meet with Jake Kloster but went in tonight hoping to meet with him to discuss my previous complaint.  He wasn't there when we got there and the manager on duty came by and said it was nice to see us back since we left.  He said, I hope we can put this behind us.  We had two drinks at the bar and moved to a table along the bar to accomodate my wife and son.    While waiting for them to arrive, the same Bar Manager that previously welcomed us, called me outside and accused me of harassing the help.  We were greeted very warmly by the staff, especially the bartender and server that were objects of my alleged  harassment by the bar manager. He repeated comments I made almost verbatim but comepletely out of context, and suddenly, I felt set up.  They must have been watching me on their TV security because every time I got up someone followed me.   Every time I went to ask the bartender if she complained, I was bumped away from the bar by thugs,.  This is a clear case of harassment and when I finally asked the bartender that was allegedly offended, she said she was uncomfortable,  When I asked her what was said that made her feel uncomfortable, she could not be specific and looked shook up when the bouncer appeared to threaten me. She was shaking and had a chalky face and looked ready to cry, so I decided to just finish our drinks and leave. I walked back to my table and was told if I would not come outside with them, they would throw mw out,  This was clearly a set up from the time we walked in and at no time would they talk to the person I was with to verify fact from fiction.  This was clearly a case of harassment to warn me off,  I am not warned but angry that this cabal of liars and criminals tried to set me up.  This was clearly a case of trying to shake me down.  I will never ever go ther again and I warn anyone  from going there.    I swear that all this is true and the establishment has gone out of there way to target me.  They invited me back just to set me up.  What a Bush League place this place is.  The remark that made the bartender uncomfatble allegedly was when the bar manager pulled down the big screen for the ball game, I mockingly said, I could bring my porn from home and watch it on the big screen. This whole deal was phony and cooked.  There were others in the crowd that made remarks far more suggestive than mine and I vehemently deny anything was ever said that crossed the line.  These are a group of oafish louts that protect for your buddy at any cost, kind of clique.  The place is not somewhere you want to waste good money.  Stay away and go somewhere else where your money is appreciated. Apparently, someone thought my post was funny, so it must be one of the Managers there.  Anyone who feels threatened in a place should recognize the bullies here.  Keep your wives and daughters away from this place.  It is just a matter of time before they are caught, which is probably why they left Scottsdale.

This trendy bar is like Scottsdale.  If you are not in, you are out.  Simply a local bar with cliques.  We went there the tonight to celebrate our success and were treated coldly. at best. Stay away from this pretentious wine bar.  It's too bad because the food was satisfying but the staff is very cliquish.  Go to Rokerj instead and have warm, friendly evening.  This is a bad place and don't be sucked in by the eclectic surroundings,  Especially stay away when the bartender Kim is on duty,  She is cold and very unfriendly and preoccupied with the other help instead of the patrons.  This place deserves to close as Scottsdale pretentiousness moves west because of high real estate cost.  Stay away with your attitude.

Having recently dined at Central Bistro, we decided to give this North Scottsdale favorite a try.  Unfortunately that night, the restaurant fell short of its reviews.  When we first got there, we anticipated a wait and were going to sit at the bar but the hostess suggested the patio.  It was a warm-ish night and the hostess sat  us at a two top next to the parking lot.  The mister dripped all over us and cars pulling in and out blinded us with their headlights.  When we asked to be moved, the hosted could only think of moving us to another two top with the same conditions.  Frustrated, we walked by her back into the main room and told her we would wait. Papardelle Bolognese when I heard the pasta was fresh made in house.  While we waited for our entrees, we attempted to break bread, then tried to cut it with a knife.  The bread was so , it was not a chewy crust but a hard shell.  We never did eat the bread and were never asked what was wrong.  Soon thereafter, our entrees appeared and my wife relished her choice.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right without some citrus-y sweet goo that many restaurants use to cover the fish.  her fingerling potatoes and vegetables were cooked to a firm perfection.  Next, I dug into my long anticipated pasta only to be disappointed in a thick, super wide tasteless pasta that wan not chewable.  The sauce was a tasty melange of meat and tomatoes but was not enough to overcome the pasta's shortcomings.  I set that aside and our waitress came by and said, "Is there anything wrong?"  It was obvious and she said she would get the manager.  He came over and I explained my disappointment and offered to replace it.  I have a policy not to order again because when you return food, the staff is upset.  They care less about the customer than their work.  Due to the late hour and my hunger pangs I ordered a cheeseburger and fries to make it quick and easy.  Again, within a few minutes, the manager appeared with my replacement order.  I cut the burger in half and noticed it was cooked a perfect medium rare.  I took a bite and savored the charcoal grilled flavor.  In my second bite, the flavor changed to a heavy salt flavor so i opened the burger and found clumps of salt and clumps of seasoning.  Rather than return a second meal, I scraped the salt and seasoning off the top and finished it.  I could not eat the fries because of the heavy dose of salt.  When the waitress and manager came back, I told them, it was cooked perfectly to temperature and asked for our check.  We paid and left right away.  No offer for a comp desert or anything but no loss.  We were glad to get out of there.   There may not be another visit in our future.

We held a lunch meeting at a local engineer's office today and  like to support local business.  We looked on Yelp  and some other sites and Urban Picnic came up.  Initially, the ordering was difficult because new owners recently took over and were in the process of setting up a new web site.  Young Eli came to the rescue and we placed our order for 15 meals with sides including nine sandwiches and six salads. We were somewhat anxious as we always are with new places but once we got to the deli and met the owners, we knew it would turn out.   Using Boars Head provisions, it had to be decent but once we got to the meeting and heard nothing but praises from our clients, all turned out well.  The sandwiches were savored and the salads looked full and tasty and everyone enjoyed their meal. Please give this place a try and you won't be disappointed.  PS They deliver to businesses around Mesa.

I scheduled a service appt. online and greeted right away by my service adviser Dave. He welcomed me with a smile and explained what they would but he recommended I have them perform the 30000 mile package to keep my vehicle in great shape. Dave then told me what would be done and the estimated cost. Rather than take the shuttle home, I elected to stay. The waiting area is comfortable and this dealership has great coffee, noshes, water, TV's, comfortable seating, newspapers and the cleanest dealership around. I took the waiting time to work with Earnhardt's free wi-fi, which I like because I can keep up with my work while waiting. Before I knew it, my service adviser came over and said I was done. Dave then went over the charges and the work details. Even check out was quick and courteous. When I walked out to my car, it was all washed and cleaned inside and out. As i was leaving, I thought to myself how nice it was to take my vehicle to a dealership with old fashioned courtesy and relationships. I highly recommend anyone to use this service dept. in the future.      Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.

Café Zupas claims to be a healthy, inexpensive alternative to regular fast food.  First, I am not sure how healthy their food is because they fail to post nutrition any nutritional information.  Second, read the menu for descriptions and don't add extras.  On a recent visit after seeing a movie at Harkins Norterra, my wife and I decided to try the place that recently opened in place of Johnny Rockets.   I ordered Chicken  Tortilla Soup and Chicken Chop Salad, My wife ordered a pesto chicken Panini.  As we went through the line, I asked for some peas.  The peas were immersed in water and the preparer added no more than a tablespoon but also managed to dilute the miniscule blue cheese added at the beginning of the line. Then, I noticed there were no tortilla strips on the Chicken Tortilla Soup, so I asked for some.  Now, I was at register and I was charged $4.99 for the Panini, $7.99 for the soup and salad, $.59 for the peas and $.59 for the missing tortilla strips in the soup.  My wife and I sat down and tried to eat our food.  The amount of chicken, tomato bits, bacon bits and egg slices were so minimal that I felt cheated immediately.  In addition, it was watered down by the clumsy person who added the peas.  Worse than the salad, the chicken tortilla soup tasted like salt and had NOTHING in it but broth and tasteless chicken.  We tried twice to get the manager to complain, but they kept walking.  Finally, one of the floor bussers, came over and asked what was wrong.  He noticed something was wrong and went to get her.  The manager came over and asked what was wrong.  I told her the salad was watery and tasteless and had very little in it other than cheap iceberg lettuce. I also told her I could feel my blood pressure rising from the excess salt in the soup and the audacity to call it chicken tortilla soup when you charged extra for the tortilla strips.  She offered to replace it with anything else on the menu so I asked for the nutritional information.  She told me that was not made available by the company so I told her never mind, just get me a refund.  She said that was not their policy.   This restaurant is so bad, I warn you to stay away.  For the same amount of money spent here, you can get unlimited soups and salads at Olive Garden which is so much better.  Even Sweet Tomatoes is a much better value with greater variety.  Don't waste your time or money here.

TEN, located at the foot of the escalators at The Esplanade has become one of these places that you know won't let you down.  We came for lunch the first time and surprised to to see an old friend Jodee behind the bar.  You all know her from Houston's and Hillstone where she was a mainstay and the excellent service she always provided.  She never lets us down.    Jeff, the convivial owner is an active front end manager and makes you feel like you are stepping into his home.  He explains his approach to satisfy his guests, knowledgeable bartenders that know their way around making excellent cocktails and true food from scratch.  Whether you order the pot roast, chicken noodle soup, chicken cordon bleu, hamburgers with fresh cut fries or any of the many items on the menu. you know you are getting fresh, well prepared real food.  Nothing is frozen here and you can taste it.   This cozy little place fits like a glove and the guests are as friendly as the staff, each asking you if you tried.......whatever they just had.  This is truly a remarkable dining experience that surprises you with its small size but overwhelms you with great food and friendly service.  Stop by and you will be pleased as I have on the several visits made there.  And don't forget to ask for the parking validation before you leave.

I went there for a couple of drinks and to order some food to go.  Huge mistake, not the drinks but the take out food.  I ordered a Chicken Taco Salad and a Chicken Quesadilla.  Unfortunately, we found Chicken Tacos that were extremely bland as well as the driest chicken I thought could be placed in food, but, alas, I was wrong.  As uninspiring as the chicken tacos were, the taco salad was ever so much worse.  Chunks of the hardest, driest chicken that were unchewable and the rest was a bunch of lettuce.  When I say this was bad, it was much worse.  Since Majerle took over Wolfley's, we hoped for better food, but really let down.  It was disgusting and I feel someone owes me an apology.  Go for drinks, but avoid the food.
