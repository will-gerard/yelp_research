Super clean, huge and nice place. I got a great hookup on my wheels! I'm not sure why people would go anywhere else!

They REALLY need to get an online menu. We tried to call and ask some questions to potentially place an order over the phone and finally had to give up and drive down. The egg flower soup was not good at all and had so much less in it than the past. The chicken chow mien was almost only noodles, again unlike the past. The moo goo gai pan was good, just not much chicken. Overall, VERY disappointed with our $31 purchase. But it was cooked very quickly. Lol

My family and a neighbor family arrived at 8:05PM on Mother's Day, 8 of us total. Here on Yelp stated they were open until 9PM. They told us they were closed and turned us away, rather than get another good sale. I bet we could have eaten and been gone, still before others that "take up camp at a table".

Awesome location, hip looking facility with lots of great inventory. Brian is a very fair and honest guy and his wife Ashleigh is great, as well as nice to look at :)  Go check them out for service or sales as well as lots of bike parts and toys!

Nice little place with wifi and great service! I ordered the fish taco mountain which is served over brown rice rather than shells. Mmmmmmm it's good

So we came to their "soft opening" months ago. They only had the bar menu. All of our food was good, but it was obvious not only how new they were, but our young server new nothing. We came back tonight and like before ordered the meatball appetizer and man they are just FANTASTIC! My woman got the Italian Wedding soup and it was also amazing. I had a special sandwich tonight that I'm sure would please most everyone, I felt it was a massive sandwich engulfing a sausage, but tasty. The first time I got a grilled ham and cheese sandwich which  was better! No place is perfect, servers come and go and when you yourself don't prepare the dish, leaves room for opinions/personal perfection, like my sandwich tonight. I'm keeping a 5 star, because I feel this place is a great place to go! If you are deciding to come here, DO IT! I just remembered we got the Manhattan Special pizza one time, to go and it was scrumptious
