I love coming here with friends to catch up. The food is great and they have some really good brews! Don't think you can really go wrong here.

I have been going to Greenfield Nails for about 4 years. The men and women who work at the salon are all very nice and do a wonderful job. My gel nails can last 3-4 weeks here and they're great at doing designs! They're always busy so I suggest calling ahead and making an appointment. If you walk in (especially on a weekend) there is a high possibility that you will have a long wait, they'll ask you to come back at a later time, or they'll be too booked for the day and not be able to fit you in.

Love this place! They're located on a church campus but are open every day. Every time I've gone in there I have been greeted by the friendly baristas - half the time I don't know what to get and they never rush me and often times have several yummy suggestions for me! They offer wifi access and there are usually students in there studying, people working away from the office, and friends catching up. The coffee shop has outside seating as well for those nice mornings and days. The church campus also has a nice playground for the kids to get out some energy. Definitely a great hidden gem!!

I really enjoy The Original Chop Shop. Their protein bowls are delicious and I always have half leftover for lunch the next day. The acai bowls are pretty good as well.

I think this place is great! They have a decent beer selection to choose from, their burgers are really good, and they have the best Cobb salad I've had! They are a little bit on the pricey side (up charging for fries if you're not a fan of chips), but I think the portions are fairly large and it is delicious so every once in a while worth it. The parking lot SUCKS but that's not their fault. I hate going to the area simply because it's very difficult to find parking...but if you can get past that frustration, definitely give this place a try. I've had friends try the hot dogs and Mac n cheese, they've said those are good too so if you're not in the mood for a burger I think it's safe to say most everything on the menu will be good.

I can see this being a nice atmosphere for drinks with friends, but I wouldn't suggest this place for dinner. My boyfriend and I went for dinner a few weeks ago - we ordered sangria (which was quite gross, it was not how sangria typically is - it tasted like a cheap red wine - did not have any fruit, no sweetness to it, and probably no brandy it's like they had no idea what sangria was), he got a pasta dish that was "okay", and I got the hummus trio. The only thing good about the hummus trio was the pita bread...it said it came with veggies and I expected cucumber and carrots - but it was all celery, gross. The hummus wasn't very flavorful. This place is twice the price of Pita Jungle and not even close to being as good. If you want good hummus, don't waste your time here.

I have been here 3 times and have gotten the peanut butter acai bowl each time. It is SO good. If you love peanut butter, definitely give it a try! This place has a TON of options and I can never seem to break away from that one - but one of these days I will. My mom and aunt both get the green acai bowl ("healthier" than my PB one apparently) and love it. It's a little dinky shop that most probably miss, but totally worth stopping in. They have more than just the acai bowls but that's all I've had so I can't vouch for the rest, but I'm sure it's all tasty!

I am not a big Chinese food fan, but the food here was pretty good. The atmosphere is what makes this place though. When we went there was a gentleman who pulled off the Elvis look doing a lot of older songs (Elvis, Johnny Cash). It was entertaining.
