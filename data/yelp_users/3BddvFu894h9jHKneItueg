Yes, I love Carolina's.  It's pretty damned good.  If you haven't been there then I suggest you check it out.  Even if only to experience the atmosphere and not necessarily the food.  But the food will keep you coming back.  I wish I lived closer but it's probably a good thing that I don't.  I'd be eating foot-long Oaxaca burritos ($4.45) everyday.  I love them.  A Oaxaca burro consists of potatoes, beans, chorizo and cheese, and it's Sonoran bliss.  I also love the red chile burros.  I'm a burro guy so I pretty much stick to anything rolled in a tortilla.    Criticisms:  Seating area sucks.  Inefficient use of existing space (what's up with no seating in that first room area?), that's about it.  Definitely go there.  And give me a call or a PM when you are so I can give you my order.

Yeah man,...I don't really know all that much about sushi or sashimi.  The things I order are bastardized American versions of a long forgotten cuisine steeped in traditional intricacies and guided by the hand of custom.  But I don't mind.  I like it.  And when my wife wants to go out and have something nice, it really looks like I did my homework if (and when) I take her to sushi.  "Oh my gosh, I love sushi."  Yeah baby, we're gonna wasabi this shizz up.    So it was Saturday and we were invited to a birthday party at a lounge where $250 dollar bottles of vodka were awaiting us in cozy confines of some random V.I.P. area where hundreds before us have made it rain on hostesses spilling out of their corsets while working that bottleservice.  What could be better than to segue into our night's exploits with a little sushi and where better than Sakana?  I'm not sure the answer to that question but since I live in Tempe this place was the ace up my sleeve.  We didn't want to get too full but we wanted to eat.  I was hungry but cautious.  So we ordered accordingly.  "My wife will have the house martini and I'll just have water (ahem).  We'll have the Rainbow Roll, the Lobster Tempura Roll and the Gyoza appetizer."  The inside of Sakana is pretty dark at night and I like that aside from have to hold the menu closer to my face to read it.  Our waitress was competent enough to bring the food quickly but not enough to get my wife's drink order correct.  It's alright.    We were hungry and we ate and we didn't get too full but definitely were satisfied.  I know my wife won't let me pass this place up again.

Family style bean curd, FTW!  It's so freaking good here and is only $4.95 (or so) for a lunch special.  Order it extra spicy.  I wasn't too fond of the hot and sour soup.  They do give you a plate of Chinese chips and salsa (ha!), ala crunchy noodles and sweet and sour sauce.    Portion size is pretty decent.  The amount of rice they give in the lunch special is a little small but I have been here when they've asked me if I wanted more rice and given it to me.    The tofu was awesome.  Big cubes, stir fried with a spicy brown sauce and a variety of veggies.  Next time I'll give the Ma Po tofu a spin.  With a drink and tip, I got out of there dropping about $8 bucks which isn't bad for a lunch special.

Seeing as how I've been here multiple times, the only rating that seems fitting is the four star 'yay! I'm a fan' rating.  In their adherence to regional style (sonoran style cuisine), Ochoa's par for the course.  Decent-to-good red chile, good enchilada sauce, super-econo lunch special (not plural).  Their lunch special consists of a choice of three items from the usual list of suspects: cheese enchilada, tostada, taco (soft or crispy), tamale, rice or beans.  I think there are a few other choices.  What's nice is you can simply get three tacos and no rice or beans, if you're not one to eat rice and beans.  Or you can get two cheese enchiladas and rice.  Whatever.  The lunch special will run you about $6 plus a drink.  In terms of location, good luck finding this place if you're not from the area.  Atmosphere?  It's a dive, no bells or whistles.  Both of these aspects are major pluses in my book.    Also, anytime I've been here the service is fast.  I've had my meal within ten minutes (or less) from the time I've ordered it.  And it's been served with the cliche' adage, "These plates are hot so be careful."  On the down side, the salsa is hit or miss.  There have been a couple times when I've been there when the salsa tasted like it could have been expired.  Then again, I went the other day and it was fresh.  You'll be able to tell.  It hasn't stopped me from returning.  Now then, if it's just you and an acquaintance and you want to try a spot that is 'authentic' and low key, this is the place.  If you're looking for someplace a little bit nicer with marginally upscale entrees, this ain't it.    For me, Garcia's (the chain) vs. Ochoa's.....Ochoa's.  However, Ochoa's vs. Carolina's,...pssshh, Carolina's.

Despite any bad or lower rated reviews, of which there are a few, this place was bustling with business last night.    Occasionally (like all the time), I'm a tad opinionated on where I'd like to be seated.  Never by the restroom, preferably a booth, and not crammed next to another group if there are more comfortable open spaces available.  This has more to do with my personal preferences and less to do with this review but I just felt I'd throw it out there.    I asked to be seated up on the raised level just north of the bar when the waitress began to lead us to a table on the floor level.  It was no big deal, she accommodated us easily.  Happy Hour up until 7pm, I believe.  $2 domestic drafts.  My wife got a Blue Moon for $2.50 and I had iced tea.  We also had an order of a dozen hot wings and fried cheese curds.   This place is definitely a bar serving bar food.  Every plate that I saw delivered to a customer looked pretty tasty and piled high with food.  I saw some super looking Nachos, a huge burger with a pile of fries, somebody even had what looked like a burger patty with a side of cottage cheese and fruit.  Even that looked good.  Our server wasn't the most attentive but he got our drinks out pretty fast and when our food hit the table (brought out by a different server) he was there to refill my iced tea and to bring my wife another beer.  You can't really ask for much more in a bar.  The wings were great.  We didn't order suicide but instead opted for hot and they were okay.  Not super hot but not super mild.  The cheese curds were new to both of us and they were okay.  Sort of just like breaded, fried chewier cheese but none the less tasty.  In the end we paid $22 bucks for two beers, two apps and an iced tea.  Not bad.    Oh yeah, you're supposed to just throw the peanut shells on the floor after eating them.  This felt weird for some reason even considering that the floor was covered with peanut shells.

Yeah, I know.  Sun Lakes?    Being that I work relatively close to this area, I'm no stranger to the lunch menu at Asian Grill.  My 'ol standby is the Spicy Honey Chicken.  Sesame Chicken is good as is General Tso.  Is that the trifecta of standard Americanized Chinese chicken dishes?  If so, these guys are cranking these items out perfectly.  It's good to note, and they do so on the menu, that Asian Grill only uses white meat when it comes to chicken.  No mysterious dark parts.  For some reason, I find this reassuring.  Lunch specials will run you about $6 plus a cup of hot tea for fifty cents or so.  It's not spendy at all.    I'd agree with the only other person who reviewed this place that the hot and sour soup is truly wonderful.  Small place, somewhat cramped seating but it's rarely over capacity when I visit.  It's a good place to not be seen if your operating on the down low.  Very incognito.  On top of that it's right next to a Bashas' so you can pick up whatever you need, if you need whatever.  Ha.

I love this spot.  It's totally economical (i.e. cheap), it's cash only and it's super quaint to say the least.  But warning, don't come here expecting anything other than a supercharged 'Bertos experience.  And when I say this, I'm making the clear distinction that the food here is awesome.  The enchilada sauce, the red chile and the green chile are super on point.  The beans are pretty good, not on that Carolina's level but close.  Tacos are head and shoulders above tons of other places.    There is no place to sit.  The only seating area is a little shack type area with old school booths, gated style good walls and an a/c that serves it's purpose but this is Phoenix and it's flippin hot.  There's about 8 booths in there.    My go-to is the 3-Way burro which is red chile, green chile and beans.  It's the best.  They have a 2-Way which is just red and green plus they have the line up of usual suspects that are all done nicely.  Grande Burro is on my list of future orders.  For this type of fast food, Sonoran style Mexican restaurant, I do feel El Norteno is doing it right.  Go there.

It's in a neighborhood that looks to be conducive to quality Mexican food.  I mean crap, Chi Chi's Cabaret is right up the road (apparently).  But I think the food failed to hit the mark in terms of outstanding Mexican/Sonoran fare.  It was lackluster and not very tasty.  Lots of decent reviews caused me to go out of my way to eat here with my family.  The prices were a little steep for the food they gave.  $12 dollar enchilada plates and $10 dinner specials.    I'd have to say the stand out entree of the night was my plate.  I ordered the MP-1 which was basically a Green Tamale dinner.  It was actually pretty good.  I like the hint of sweetness that is present in the masa.  The beans were decent as well and tasted homemade not canned.  But there wasn't anything very 'Green' in any of the flavor of the entree.    Otherwise, everything was pretty standard.  Service was great.  Food came fast.  But all in all, I wasn't knocked off my feet.    I might possibly give this place another chance.  I really did like the ambience and location.  We'll see.

These guys rule.   Used tires.  Flats fixed.  They get it done.   I've been in twice for used tires.  First time, I couldn't find a place anywhere with a used tire my size.  Everyone had new ones or could get a new one.  But Frontier came through with a used tire in good condition.  No prob.    The next time, a different tire needed replacing and the homies had my tire size, no questions asked.  I'm pretty satisfied with these guys.  It's on AZ Ave in Chandler.  The staff is all Hispanic/Mexican.  They've always been courteous with me and haven't tried to rip me off.  Good stuff.

When I asked coworkers about the best Mexican food in Maricopa they said Headquarters was the spot.  So I had to go and see for myself.  The place is totally my speed.  Small.  Dive-y.  All wood err'thang.  Curt and irritated waitresses who are only there to get your order and your food.  I could see them being rude and terrible but on the day I went they were quick with the food and refills.  The chips and salsa were pretty decent.  I like hot but I don't base judgment on hot.  It's just my preference.  The salsa was tasty but for my tastes could have been hotter.    Prices are way reasonable.  I think it was cheap.    Mostly all locals, workers on break for lunch, families.  Only two larger booths, the rest were four-seaters.    I didn't even have Mexican food.  The night before I'd eaten at Poncho's on S. Central.  Day before that I had a local burrito.  So I wasn't feeling any more Mexican.   However, most everyone at my table ordered Mexican.  I saw a huge Chimi, a taco plate, an enchilada plate and huevos rancheros.  All looked good.  The enchilada plate, my wife ordered, was a tad cheesy for me.    I ordered the El Diablo burger which a basic green chile/cheese burger.  It was great, greasy and hot.  The chile wasn't hot but the sandwich was.  Fries were homemade.    I'm putting it in the rotation.

This place is small, like two-and-a-half booths small.  On a Sonoran, winter afternoon, this could be troublesome as a cool draft of air will slither in every time somebody opens the door.  No fountain drinks.  Beyond that the menu is pretty huge considering it's such a teeny space.  Pizzas ranging from small personal pizzas and running the gamut up through a big 24" monster.  The prices are respectably decent, no price gouging.  The day I went I had a meatball sub with fries which was one of the many lunch specials they offer.  It was $5.50 but an even $6 bucks with tax.  Not bad at all.  The male cashier, who I assume is also one of the owners, wasn't all that personable but he wasn't rude.  He just seemed like he would rather be in the back doing anything other than manning the register.    When the female cashier returned, which I am assuming is the other owner, she was very nice and hospitable.  She checked on me a couple times to make sure I had everything I needed.  I'm not the biggest meatball sub freak but every once in a while I'll get the urge to take one on.  I'm glad I did today.  It was great.  Everything was served piping hot.  If anything I would say the sauce could be a little more flavorful but it's not anything that would keep me from ordering this same sandwich again.  This place is in the strip mall/shopping center that also houses Albertson's, Chen's Chinese and AZ Hair Company.  Check it out.

Probably the best red chile burro I've had here in the Valley.    Every time I come here I either get the special with a red burro, rice and beans or I order a red burro enchilada style.  The chile is spicy, the sauce is thick and the beef is cubed and not shredded.  It's great.  La Fonda is an older joint.  If I was ever not with my full family of five people, I'd probably enjoy sitting in one of those smaller booths.  They're intimate while still crowded next to each other.  Occasionally the waitresses are hit or miss.  For the most part, they are courteous and speedy.   I love the chips and salsa.

I'm not really sure that I like Wong's Place.  Both times I've been here I've had to send the soup back for another variety.    The first time I had hot and sour and didn't like it so I asked for egg drop.  The egg drop soup came back and it was okay.  The second time I remembered that I didn't like the hot and sour and order the egg drop but this time the egg drop tasted funny.  So I asked for Wonton instead.  The Wonton was okay.  Both times I had Wong Jo chicken as a lunch special.  I wasn't really feeling it on my second visit.  Matter of fact, the second time I visited I brought my whole family and we all had lunch.  I tasted most everyone's entrees and wasn't really all that impressed.    They all had basic things like sweet and sour chicken, mongolian beef, sweet and sour shrimp.  Things that normally you would think would be pretty good as they're very standard.  Nothing spectacular.    The accompanying photo is of the Wong Jo chicken from my first visit.  I'm not really feeling Wong's Place.  I don't think I'll be back.  Sorry.

I really liked this place.  So much so that on a recent weeklong visit to Las Vegas, I ate here three times.  It's a chill spot serving up basic diner fare but keeping it a notch above the IHOPs and Denny's of the world.  Remember the end of Pulp Fiction (or middle) where Vincent and Jules are having breakfast at that diner that gets robbed.  Well, this is sorta that place minus the robbery.  Also, lots of big windows make the place much brighter than Tarantino's joint.  The first morning I had blueberry pancakes.  They're served three to an order and topped with blueberries, blueberry syrup and a dollop of whipped cream.  I asked the waitress if they came in a short stack because I didn't think I would finish them all.  She said no one does (finish them).  The verdict: excellent.    What really contributed to my liking of this place is the fact that it's a 'family restaurant'.  I was watching my three kids during the day while their mom attended conferences and it was no problem getting two of the rugrats into a booth while the other one was next to me in a car seat (she's only two months old).    Nobody was pissed that I had kids there.  A majority of the people were older, 50s or 60s.  It was a pleasant vibe for my family to enjoy breakfast.    It says it's open 24 hrs but I never got in beyond noon.  Buy my son was able to order spaghetti from the kids meal at 9am which was hella cool because he's not really into breakfast.    Everything was good which can be expected.  It wasn't tremendous or knock your socks off or high-end.  It was good which is what you expect when you go out for breakfast.

I wish I knew a little more about dim sum and the names and ingredients of the entrees that fill the carts.  I feel ridiculous for pointing and asking, "What's that?" only to be responded to in limited english.  The up side is that I end up trying new things and just taking what looks good.  Luckily for me almost everything I picked was really tasty.  I have been out for dim sum before but I don't remember the names of things.  My fam and I came in for dim sum after catching an early movie on Sunday morning.  We were seated quickly which was surprising considering the place was packed AND we were a party of six.    These things were great: shrimp dumplings, garlic shrimp dumplings, bean curd wraps, steamed pork buns (X100), shrimp balls and shrimp egg rolls.  Apparently we chose a lot of shrimp.  I was hoping they'd bring around the bbq pork chow mein noodles but they never did.  I did see people with them at their tables so I know they must have been on a cart somewhere.  The negatives included: Our table had no chili oil, since we were seated at the back it was hard for the carts to get to us, a tad crowded, not enough rotation of carts coming around.  All that aside, this is the third or fourth time I've been here and I probably will be back.  I left very full and satisfied.

I think in terms of local hamburger joints, Lenny's is pretty bad ass.    They have tons of toppings and ways to jazz up your burger.  You can watch them make your burger through the glass.  The shakes are pretty good as well.    It's a hole in the wall with enough character to raise it a few notches above the rest.  Other places, that are dives but good, like Lucky Boy are in the same class but Lenny's seems more like a destination as opposed to a drive thru.    However, to put in all in perspective, we're talking hamburgers here.  Nothing gourmet.  Five and diner style hamburgers, grilled sandwiches and fries.  You can add jalapenos, green chiles, chili, cheese, bacon,....whatever.  You pay one price for a drink and can choose whatever size you want.  The drinks are self serve.  It's easy on the wallet as well, as it should be.  I fed my family of five for around $35 or so.    My main criticism is the lack of big booths or more spacious seating.  Every time I go, the room with extra seating is closed off.  But seating everyone between the counter and the small booths is part of the experience, I suppose.

Dos Gringos is not my type of place.  I rarely drink or party or watch sports.  But I do love Mexican food and more specifically red chile burros (here in AZ).  By my own measure, I make awesome salsa.  Hot and flavorful both red and green.   The salsa at Dos Gringos was bland and tasted like a can of diced tomatoes was hastily pureed with an onion and some salt.  It was nothing special and that's sad because salsa is cheap to make.    The nachos we ordered tasted like Taco Bell's Nacho Supreme just in a bigger portion.  Even with black beans, the flavor was bland.   Okay, the upside: the weather is really beautiful right now and sitting out on the patio was really nice.  I couldn't have imagined a better way to kill an hour on Sunday.   Also, our waitress was moderately more attentive than most others.  The sign posted out front read '$4 Lunch Specials' but apparently this doesn't apply on weekends.  Why put out the sign then?  She still gave us our lunch for $4 bucks which is nice.  I don't think I'll go back unless I'm really, really bored.

I always find good used records at Zia.  I know I'll come out with something.  They're pricing is usually pretty high on records/artists/genres that are popular or trendy.  That's pretty standard for anyplace.  The Ghost of Eastside keeps their prices slightly lower with more obscure selection.  However, the flipside is that Zia will overlook gems in their used stock and price them pretty low.  Probably because they don't know much about certain band line-ups, labels or releases in general.  I've found quite a few gems for two or three bucks in the used section.    Used records are where it's at.  There is no rationale in buying anything new because they'll press those things in such high numbers that they're not rare anymore.  I'll still buy some new things from bands and such.  Not a lot.  Anyhow, I inadvertantly went to this Zia on record store day.  I was eating with my kids at that Chinese place around the corner.  I found a bunch of shit (not all rare but stuff I wanted): The Shit Licker's EP "Cracked Cop Skulls (total early swede crust/dis), Orchid s/t 7" on Hand Held Heart, The Automatics "Golden Hits" and "Makin Out", Chubbies "Im the King" 7" on Sympathy, The Tie That Binds "Adding Machine" 7", Gravy Train "Hello Doctor" LP.   All %15 off for record store day.  I'll always check out Zia.  I'll always check out anyplace that sells records but I have to say that I do like Zia.

It sounded like Bastard Noise or Merzbow was blasting through the speakers of the drive thru menu.  Same menu as you'd find at any other 24 hour Mexican joint.  I only look at the burro section.  No 'Can i help you?' or 'Can I take your order?'.  Nothing like that.  I just go for it.  "I'll have two breakfast burros; egg, potato and cheese.  And a bean and cheese burrito."  Noise distorts out through the speaker.  I get the hint that it's rhythmically broken up into syllables.    "Hello?".  More noise.  Fuck it.  I pull forward.  The lady comes to the drive-thru window and repeats my order back to me.  She's basically got everything right.  The tip jar is a styrofoam cup taped rather shoddily to the drive-thru window.  She's not really sexy or young or anything but she's pretty.  I put a quarter in the tip jar cup thingy.  Our burros were $10.11.  It takes about three to four minutes for the burros to be wrapped, bagged and given to us.  My kids are pretty stoked.  The red salsa is pretty great as well.    Then it's on to Greyhound Park as we cruise Van Buren and sight see on our way to the flea market.  Saturday is beautiful.  Note:  If you're at the drive thru window, don't look down.  It's full of old gum, straw wrappers, cigarette butts, gross spilled milk.  Trust me.  Eyes forward.  You're good.

The new digs look pretty nice and are somewhat of an improvement over the old spot.  When I say 'somewhat', what I'm alluding to is that there is often a certain charm that remains in the details of any original establishment.   In this case, the little patio area with the fountain is no more.  But on the whole, it's a step up.  Chorizo, chorizo, chorizo.  Somebody in the talk forum started a thread about chorizo and another yelper mentioned The Original Burrito Co as having the goods.  I had to find out.  The verdict: it's good and I like it.    Their chorizo is about what you expect when you close your eyes and conceptualize what chorizo is supposed to taste like.  It has a subtle spiciness but is not too vinegary or salty.  When folded into eggs dashed with papas everything works together in a complimentary cloud of Sonoran awesomeness rolled into a tortilla.    I had '#14:The combination - chorizo con huevos y papas'.  No regrets.  Two salsas are available in the salsa bar, a red and green, along with sliced, pickled jalapenos.  I like the fact that they give you a small bag of chips with your order.  I'm definitely coming back to try their red and green chile as they boast both of these entrees to be made with a New Mexican flair.  That could be a critical turning point in my criteria but I'll remain the optimist and base my return on the delicious breakfast burro I got here.

I love Lucky Boy.  I love Lucky Boy.  I love Lucky Boy.  Don't go inside, it's not very flattering.  Drive thru.  If you order a 1/4 lb burger it's one patty.  If you order a 1/2 lb burger it's two patties, a double whammy.    They have three or four custom choices for the style in which they'll prepare you burger.  Basically it's like a ranch burger, a thousand island burger, a bbq burger or a mustard and ketchup burger.  Choose one.    Peanut butter-anything shakes are good.  I've had it with Butterfinger and butterscotch and chocolate.  It's all good.  Their fries are good as well.  It's super cheap like $5 for a burger and fries.  Go here.  Call me when you're on your way.

I hate it when people are like, "I'm from Chicago so I know what a Chicago hot dog IS!!!"  But dammit, I grew up in a AZ/NM border town and this place falls way short.  It doesn't really even seem like the food is made in a New Mexican style of preparation.  It's more like New Mexican as seen through a Sonoran filter.  I mean no disrespect to Sonoran style Mexican food, it's tasty as well.  But the green chile sauce I've had smothered over, and within, various dishes at my fave NM spots has a lot more green chile in it and is NOT merely a greenish gravy with green onions and pork (or beef).  The essence of the sauce should be green chile and not over compensated, or embellished with too many spices otherwise.    Thus, the meal I had at Arriba was lackluster.  I had huevos rancheros.  The potatoes were warm and stale as if they'd been sitting for a spell.  The refried beans could have been canned and I wouldn't have known the difference.  Even the  cheese was bland.  I've been here twice expecting to be knocked off my seat with a NM/green chile flavor explosion.  No dice, chino.  Aside from the cheesy name, if you'd like a step above this substandard NM fare, try Si Senor in Chandler.  They're pretty solid.  And if you want fire, there is always Los Dos Molinos.  Arriba, you need work.

This place is situated in a strip mall that surrounds Bashas'.  Is this Chandler or what?  I thought it was Queen Creek.  Having been looking for someplace new to have lunch, I remembered seeing this place in passing and thinking, "Bistro..?".  Well, yes, it's not a bistro.  It is, in fact, a standard Chinese restaurant.  But one thing seems to be pretty certain with these types of places,....lunch specials.  It's really hard to go wrong with a lunch special.  Considering the proximity of Hong Kong Bistro to my place of work (BFE) along with the relative affordability and efficiency I experienced, I'm giving this place a big fat four star rating.  It was mad decent, as the kids say (or said maybe three years ago).    It was also mad empty with only two or three other groups of patrons.  I like my Chinese hostesses/cashiers to be a little more adamant and curt.  I like it when they direct me to where I'm going to sit without any second thought or consideration to where I'd like to be placed.  I expect them to immediately take my order and then sigh or roll their eyes when I ask for a brief moment to look over the menu.    Unfortunately, this wasn't the case here.  The hostess was extremely pleasant.  She asked me if I was ready to order and I told her that I was but then said "Well, I have a couple questions."  I didn't really have questions but just wanted to see what she would do.  "All of our entrees are made with white meat," was the answer I received when I asked about a particular chicken dish.  In the end, I ordered Gang Pang Chicken because it sounded funny almost like Gang Bang Chicken but really, it was surprisingly good.  It's like General Tso Chicken minus the broccoli plus jalapenos.  Pretty freaking rad.  I never order drinks outside of hot tea and water because yes, I'm a cheap bastard.  The waitress kept both filled to the brim.  Awesome.  When all was said and done, I paid $6.50 and dropped a two dollar tip because I felt it was worthy.   I'll probably come back sometime.

I really liked the brisket pho I ordered here.  It was sooo good.  Quite honestly,  I don't know much about pho.  I've had it once or twice before.  It seems to be hearty noodle soup with rich broth that can be kicked up a few notches with bean spouts (for added crunch), fresh basil, hoisin and sriracha.    I love the fact that I have some measure of control over how spicy I can make it or how what I add can affect the taste.  Maybe I just like the process.  unPhogettable is a corny name.  I had solicited advise from my friends on FB on where to get good pho.  Khai Hoan was the definite consensus but it was closed that day.  unPhogettable was next.    Located in the Mekong Plaza, I did get the sense that it should be decent.  It's surrounded by other asian restaurants and an asian supermarket.  It wouldn't reflect well on the business if it wasn't good.  From the get-go, the service was friendly and fast.  I'm assuming it was the owner who stopped and talked with us but she was super friendly and helpful.  We ordered spring rolls (with pork and shrimp) served with peanut sauce, hot tea, vietnamese coffee and two bowls of pho (one brisket and the other veggie).  Everything came fast and was delicious.  The peanut sauce that accompanied the spring rolls was soo good.  I loved the pho.  It was tasty and hot.  Having added everything provided to me, it made the soup even better.  Like I said, I'm no pho connoissuer but this pho was really good to me.  All together I think it ran us $25. Can't wait to go back.

Any time you go to teppan it's going to be expensive but the quality of the service and food should be on par with the dollaz.    I think Hon Machi is about where it should be in terms of service and food.  Albeit, I haven't tried the sushi, the teppanyaki has always been great.    I have three kids (*gasps*) and I often dread going anyplace that doesn't scream 'KIDS MEAL' when I'm taking the gang out.  But every once in while you gotta suck it up and do it.    Hon Machi was very accommodating.  My kids were on their best behavior.  They actually do have a kid's menu from which my son ordered yakisoba with the veggies on the side.  No prob.  The dish came quick from the kitchen.  My daughter had the kids shrimp and it was plenty for her plus the fried rice.  Both my wife and I had the shrimp/steak combo and we had no complaints.  When it comes to teppan, I'm no expert.  I've been a couple times and I like the atmosphere of this place.  I like that the teppan chefs are outgoing and make the experience enjoyable.  Yeah, they joke.  Yeah, they flame that grill out and throw things around but that's what I want if I'm gonna drop some coin.  Go.  Decide for yourself.  I think it's good and actually it wasn't all that expensive.

Within the Phoenix metro, I never order green chile.  This premise extends to Tucson and everywhere in between.  It's just not as good as what you get in NM and there's no real reason to try, as far as I'm concerned.  But AZ red chile can be top notch.  I was bored with mediocre burritos and decided to take the plunge and order a green chile burrito (with rice and beans which were .25 extra each).    It was awesome.  Seriously.  Great green chile which was con carne and pork.    I am a fan.  I will be back.  The salsa bar is okay at best.  The hot red is tasty.

Single shot of expresso -fucking crazy.  Soo good and strong.  Nothing Starbucks about the flavor.  Explaining the tier system in regards to the sale of pounds of coffee was sort of confusing.  But, I bet the coffee is worth it  judging by the expresso I had.    I'm not hungry anymore.

Maybe I was just really hungry or maybe this was actually a great sandwich.  I'm going with the later.  I had just gotten done shooting a TFCD with a model at a studio down the way.  Holy cow, talk about a 'hot' shoot.  Oh man.    But I was really, really hungry afterward.  This place was just a stone throw from the place I was shooting at.  During my visit there was only one guy working the counter and making the sandwiches.  That would be my main gripe.  He saw me standing at the counter but gave me the 'I'll be right with you' line.  He wasn't being a jerk about it but it did take him about five minutes to finish what he was doing before taking my order.  I decided on the ATC (advocado, turkey and cheese) and it was great.  I loved the bread and the toppings.  Normally, I'm not much of a mayonnaise person but I decided to roll the dice and let them make the sandwich as they do.    I had the 6 inch and it was $4.50 exactly just like it said on the menu.  It was definitely filling.  I'll be back.

This little gem of a restaurant is tucked away in a strip mall connected to a Fry's Marketplace.  I would have never noticed the place if it weren't for the big letters on the window proclaiming "Lunch Buffet - $5.95".  Somehow my radar has been finely tuned to pick up on these words.  Of the three times I've been here, I've only had the buffet twice.  That ill-fated third visit was marred by my being fifteen minutes late.  By that time the buffet had already been cleared, so get there on time.  Buffet runs 11:30am-1pm.  The six dollar price tag for the lunch buffet is worth it.  They only have about ten items but they're quality dishes.  Americanized but good.  Hot and sour is the only soup option on the buffet but that's fine by me.  It's awesome hot and sour soup.    I love the stir fried green beans with garlic, sesame chicken, roasted chicken, BBQ pork fried rice and the egg rolls.    I think there's only like two hostesses/waitresses.  One seems pretty crabby and not very welcoming.  I like her.  What's a meal without a little anxiety?  Been three times and I'll probably be back.

Wut tha'.  All my friends (vegan/punx/activists/people who are 'conscientious') love Nami.  Yes, Tsoynami!  Uh huh.  So I took my kids there to see if it was the real deal.  My kids aren't vegans (that they've told me), so we were gonna figure it out.    They loved it.  They even loved the atmosphere of the small establishment.  Kooky indie ambient sounds.  A girl with a bun atop her head but with a shaved head around the bottom.  High waisted shorts?  Yeah man.  But we got three Tsoynamis.  All different flavors.  They were like $4/5 each.  No biggie.    I'll probably come back.
