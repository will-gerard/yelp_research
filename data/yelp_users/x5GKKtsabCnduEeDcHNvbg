Until a year ago, I'd have given this place ten stars! My family has been eating here for well over 10 years. I have lucky-cat polaroids from almost every birthday. Plus, I can't even begin to guess the number of out-of-towners I've brought in or locals I've referred here. Sadly, since about ten months ago, I have had something negative occur with EVERY visit. This is not an exaggeration. In the 6-8 times I've gone in or ordered out in the past 10 months I have NOT ONCE been satisfied with my experience. Whether it was forgetting soy sauce and chopsticks in the to-go bag, messing up the order, or--my personal favorite--FORGETTING TO EVEN PUT MY ORDER IN until I arrived to pick it up, I've been consistently more irritated with the "service". To top it off, no one ever seems concerned when I ask for things to be fixed. Today my handroll was made incorrectly even though I repeated my order several times over the phone and the waitress REPEATED IT BACK to me. The best part was, when I drove back to have it remade no one apologized for the inconvenience, and I even saw the sushi chef chuckle and roll his eyes over the request. Rude and unprofessional. Then, the new roll sat on the bar for way too long before the waitress brought it back to me, letting the rest of my order get warm in the car. Even now as I write this and eat, I'm noticing that my salad lettuce is turning BROWN. Pretty gross. It breaks my heart that after so many loyal years I'm going to have to look for a new sushi joint. I hope Sakana's staff decides to improve their customer service before they lose any more long-term clientele.  P.S. Drives me crazy that they have no helpful menu on their site--just a list with no descriptions. I'm uploading the sushi menu for everyone.

The guys that run Jz will become your buddies! So friendly, and they remember you when you return! Good craft beer selection, growlers, and a surprisingly large selection of wine! They also have Mexican paletas, so WIN. :)

Such a shame. Just had an incredibly unpleasant customer service interaction at this location. Having lost my receipt I attempted to exchange an item I had purchased for store credit. At the store I was told different policies by two different employees that both turned out to be partially incorrect. I was told that there was absolutely no way to look up my transaction from only five days earlier without my receipt (I was later told by two different managers that this is not true). The second employee also gave this information to me in a condescending and unprofessional manner.  Her attitude caused me to leave and attempt to resolve the issue later. So shortly after I called the store manager to determine what the real policy was because of the multiple different stories I had received in person. First he said something along the lines of "well maybe you should've kept your receipt" as if it wasn't a genuine accident on my part to have lost it. Clearly I had not purposely gotten rid of it. The manager also must have already heard about the interaction from his employees because he assumed that I was mad without me ever saying so. I told him that I didn't understand why he had immediately been so aggressive with me over the phone. He just began arguing that he was not being rude to me. As someone who has worked in many customer service positions in the past I would never try to tell my customer that I'm not being rude. If a customer perceives it there's obviously something different that a manager should be doing to effectively communicate with him/her. I've had nothing but pleasant experiences at every other Big 5 location, so I suppose I will just need to stop visiting this one for the sake of my sanity. Too bad--it's so close to my house!

I attended the special "Sharks After Dark" event on Saturday night and had an AMAZING time. Many other reviewers have complained about the smaller size of this aquarium. It's in a mall, not sea world, so just keep that in mind. I personally PREFERRED that it was scaled down for a nice 1.5-2 hour experience. The special event was also great for those of us without kids, as it created a more mellow ambiance--perfect for a date night! Plus, the Groupon made the price incredibly reasonable. The exhibits are beautifully maintained with plenty of fish and aquatic plant life. I enjoyed the touchpool area where you can hold some sea stars, slipper lobsters, and other small critters. The window bubbles inside the tanks created moments of immersive viewing--so awesome! Staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the animals. I would definitely return. My only critique was the lack of octopus, squid, or cuttlefish exhibits (my favorite sea creatures). However, I realize the exhibits are supplied only by rescued animals, or animals bred in captivity. I can sacrifice seeing my favorites when it means they are instead living in the wild! :)

Just got my first tattoo today! Mark did an awesome job and was so friendly and patient. I had to take my shirt off for my tattoo, and he was so absolutely professional. I never for a moment felt uncomfortable. I walked away with exactly what I wanted, and I know where I will be going for any future tattoos!

Delicious fig and prosciutto grilled cheese with a side of tomato bisque! Mmmm. It's always mellow here and the service is great. House-made pickles are tasty! Take home some craft beer or gourmet cheese! Great place to grab a quick but yummy lunch.

This salon is pretty standard. My tech was not chatty, but I don't mind because I'm terrible at small talk. I needed an acrylic fill and new gel color. She listened to what I wanted for the shape of my nails and trimmed them exactly how I wanted. What I really liked was she confirmed the price before painting. She said "if you want glitter it will be $30, is that okay?" At a lot of salons it's like a suspenseful gamble when it comes to the price because they don't mention it till you go to pay. My nails look great and I had no problem paying with my debit card. I did leave a cash tip like everyone else is mentioning, but they have a sign posted very clearly on the front desk stating that they only except their tips in cash. Overall I was satisfied.

Hipster gastro-paradise. Love the food here, but what really sets it apart for me is the IMMENSE selection of craft beers on tap. I'm so picky on what I like, and this place always has something I enjoy. Also, try the wings! Amazing flavor. Four stars because the service could be a little faster.

Happy with the final product, but not the process. First time here, and no one directed me to gel vs. regular color samples. Thus, I picked a glitter sample only to later find out it would not work for my gel manicure. That's fine, but the tech seemed irritated to have to wait for me to pick something new. Meanwhile, my mother was getting a pedicure. They decided to skip my mani and start hers--IN THE PEDI CHAIR. They had a soaking bowl balanced on a bolster in her lap and were reaching haphazardly over her to work on her hands. We hadn't mentioned being in any hurry, so this was totally unnecessary multitasking. After tolerating this for a few minutes, my mom said, "I'm sorry, this really isn't very relaxing" to which they simply laughed and continued. Her entire appointment continued this way. Back to mine, I decided that combining two different gel glitters would replicate the look I had originally envisioned. My new tech agreed to this plan. After awhile in I noticed her only using one of the glitters. When I asked about the other she argued that I wouldn't even be able to tell the difference. She showed me on one nail to make a point, but I liked the look and asked her to complete it on the rest. She sighed and proceeded to do so with attitude. Rude. I get my nails done to feel pampered, not burdensome. I will simply take my business elsewhere next time.

Whiskey Ranch has catered lunch at my work several times now. Cannot express how tasty their food is!! The first time I had the pulled pork. Super moist and juicy, great flavor. The second time, though...PHENOMENAL. The brisket is INSANE. It completely fell apart on the bun and in my mouth. Killer. The sides are like your mama makes it! Good ol' down-home coleslaw and baked beans. The potato salad is my personal fave. Friendly, fast service with unbeatable taste! Come back to Bell Mortgage anytime!

I'm so confused by all the rave reviews. I was craving a donut and I'd kept hearing about Bosa, so I made a run. Tried the chocolate raised donut and a glazed donut hole. I'm beyond disappointed...I've had better donuts at the gas station! Besides being mediocre at best, they left an awful aftertaste that wont go away! Bummer.

Iced coffee machine AND espresso machine. Is this caffeine heaven?!? Come here almost every day on my way to work. Employees are super friendly and helpful. The place is always clean with short or no lines. Plenty of parking so you don't have to park at the pump!
