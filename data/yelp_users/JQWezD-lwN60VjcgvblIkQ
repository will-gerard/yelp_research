Love the name, makes me think if Il Postino, or Positano when looking quickly, both great Italian things.  Followed the rave reviews to here, from Yelp and word of mouth. Expectations may have been off, as we came here for a nice dinner, but this place probably should be treated more as a trendy appetizer or drink spot. Great atmosphere and service, and at one point could picture having a large group together on the large seating area in the back. Not really sure what I'm missing though, the bruschetta was good-not-great, and if you don't feel like a salad or panini for an entree, your options seem limited. For a trendy drinking hole, there could've been a few more than 4 beers on tap. As tasty as Deschutes River Ale is, there are usually more options in most other bars that offer any craft beer. Didn't take a serious look at the wine list this time around. Trying many different kinds of bruschetta in one order was a nice way to taste many things, and appreciate that they were trying interesting ingredients such as the tomato spread, but again, nothing I'll be remembering or craving. Would like to try the butchers block if there's another visit. Didn't try the dessert, as La Grande Orange is right next door, and our loyalties are there for sweets. The outdoor patio looked inviting, and would like to kick it there when its not so Phoenix-y in the middle of summer. Would like to give it another shot some other time, but probably wouldn't wait in line to do so.

Another great suggestion Chris B, you da man!! Unlike many Phoenix sushi joints, the rolls were interesting and had taste. Spent much less than expected for 2 with special rolls and drinks. Especially liked the Red Dragon Roll and Seared Tuna Roll. The tuna was seared perfectly, next time we'll order two. The baked Mussels had a large portion, had a strange texture and fatty mayo aftertaste, so won't do that one again. A little dark, and they were vacuuming while we were eating, but overall a good experience and we'll be back.

I'm an MD, who has worked in several medical offices in the past, and with respect to both sides of the doctor patient relationship, I am surprised and displeased by the lack of organization and apathy toward patient's schedules.  I have a clean dental history, and am just looking for a professional dental office simply for my family's cleanings, but this place does not seem to achieve these fairly modest standards.   Scheduling fails: Just got a call today-Tuesday that they are canceling my Friday appointment as they are unexpectedly and suddenly closed that day. (Cancellation call was 26 minutes after receiving an email confirmation to that same appointment no less).  This is not the first, second, or third time they have called or emailed to change dates or times.  I pressed for a reason, and was only given a vague "equipment maintenance." They tried to reschedule for a different day of the week, but my vacation week has been booked for months. It seems getting to an appointment with them always has always had an unacceptable level of drama and flexibility on the patient's end involved, as each appointment involves several phone calls to change when they can see you, if not Kokopelli closing their office at the last minute and canceling the visit outright.  Billing fail: The one time we successfully went to them, we gave them our insurance card upon arrival, and before going back said "make sure our insurance covers this, or else we'll make other arrangements," and ... SURPRISE, get a bill for hundreds a month later stating our insurance didn't cover our appointment.  Although the office organization seems to be lacking, the staff up front is very friendly, and ancillary dental assistants are very friendly as well. The office seems clean and I personally found the care adequate, thus the slightly greater than minimal score. My pregnant wife tells me they gave her a local anesthetic she's not supposed to receive, after she specifically instructed them not to give her this and a few other specific meds (she gave them a pamphlet of what to avoid).  On my visit Dr. Block seemed just ok, that might be due to a slight personality clash more than anything.  Not a fan of writing these negative reviews, and have no major issue with a business dropping the ball once or twice, but have to push back and put my opinion here when there is such little respect for one's time.  We gave this place many chances, we live right down the street and would love to support a local business and take our kids to such a convenient place for years to come, but this place is too high maintenance and unpredictable. We'll drive a little further for a simple teeth cleaning without the drama.  Now excuse me while I floss the associated stress out of my system, & swish and spit this experience from my memory.

What else can you say about TJ's? There's a reason people talk about it like they're in a cult.   My faves: dark chocolate covered almonds with turbinado sugar & sea salt, frozen mango/vanilla bars, dried mango, vanilla almond granola clusters, dried bananas (later put in said clusters), prosciutto, Rosemary Italian crackers, mahi mahi burgers, coconut crusted cashews, Sardinian thin crackers, pita crackers, green chile chicken burritos, many types of trail mix, any flower bunch, green tea mints, orange flavored sparkling water.  In a perfect world they'd have some bad-for-you-products with more preservatives-better buns for hot dogs & burgers comes to mind, sugary jelly, but I understand why this isn't found here. I'd rather get my cheeses, beer, and wine from elsewhere, and for some reason the chicken often has a weird texture, but the good far surpasses the minimally bad.  Very friendly and helpful staff at this branch, never had anything other than smiles on check out, and they've watched my son grow and always say hi and talk to him. Very efficient check outs, surprisingly never a long line, even on weekends. Makes my waking up before they open to avoid the crowds TJs experience in Union Square NYC way back when a distant memory.

I'm weird & picky about movies, & I realize this. We also go to the movies maybe once every 2 years, only to something we really want to see in theaters (Boyhood this time around), & I usually prefer renting at home. So I find having people walk around and serve you, and eating something savory while watching the screen, kind of strange, but I can see how many human units would like this experience.  That said I love being able to reserve seats, makes the experience so much better. I check times a few days in advance, grab the prime seats at a movie I'm excited about, and show up as the previews are rolling out worry free. This time around we actually had to get the usher to kick people out of our prime seats to take theirs way up front, very satisfying!  Never experienced anything but Fork & Screen, but this has been good. I'm not a fan of the food they serve, and everything seems pretty expensive ($5 for a soda), but I only get popcorn & soda, and save my appetite for the real food in the area afterward. Movie ticket online was pricey but comparable to modern rates (around $12 each). Service has always been well organized & pleasant, they try to do all the distracting delivery & bill paying during previews & end, but you can order something during the movie if you want. The garage setup was strangely confusing, we took a different entrance & ended up on a lower level, but this worked out to not really be an issue, and they validate with an easy to use card machine-just remember to bring your parking ticket upstairs. So a good experience all around, will check up on it in another 2 years.

OK, you know what to expect here, it's Costco. Helpful happy workers, free samples everywhere, Electronics next to toothbrushes, and impulse buys that will last until you move again. I usually go to the Chandler branch, but this review assumes all Costcos are pretty darn similar.   Things you may/may not know about Costco: Very good business practices-employees have lots of chances to move up the corporate ladder, people who start at an entry level job usually stay for a long while. One of the leading businesses in fair wages (starting wage over $10/hour).  Secret Price Codes: if price ends in .97 it's been marked down, * asterisk at the upper right part of the sign means clearance markdown, odd pricing (.79, .49, .89 etc) means they got a deal from the manufacturer, .88 or .00 means the manager has marked the price down.  I don't usually eat red meat, but if I have to buy a good steak I make a special trip here, their steaks are phenomenal. I hear good things about the salmon as well but never tried it. Great booze selection, my go to if I'm out of scotch or Stone IPA. Flowers are always fresh and a great selection, always a good place to stock up on peanuts or paper towels. Their produce is often surprisingly great, raspberries, blackberries, avocados, asparagus, spring mix, and just bought a box of "Bunny Mangoes" yesterday that were delicious and will probably go back today or tomorrow for more.  I haven't had their hot dog deal since I was a kid, but $1.50 for a large dog and soda seems like time warp pricing from the 1970s.  A few things make Costco just short of absolutely perfect: most of the produce is not organic (this should change with time), no diesel at gas pump, Kirkland large purchases are nice but definitely not luxury (if you're buying something like furniture for example), the manual customer controlled scanners they have at Chandler (but not San Tan or Tempe) never seem to work out (always miss an item or get extra scrutiny when leaving the building), but these are minor gripes specific to my taste.

Surprisingly good & fast no nonsense breakfast. Get there early on the weekends if you can. Tasty and not too greasy sausage links, side fruit plate was fresh and a nice mix of fresh strawberries/blueberries/grapes, and the granola pancakes were very good as well. Wifey likes her potatoes, and pretty much everything else, extra crispy, and said they did them perfectly. Accommodating staff, and kid friendly, saw a few other toddlers. We'll be back for weekend brunch again soon.

Hello, my name is Andy, and.... oh wait wrong place. Choose your vice here. Always a good experience. The staff are professional and know their stuff, selection is 2nd to none if you know what you're looking for, may be a little overwhelming if not. I'm often blown away by the wines. They are organized by region and/or type (i.e. Bordeaux/Burgandy for some, but Sparkling for others), and it helps to have a specific one in mind prior to browsing. Beer variety is extensive with standards such as Ommegang, Goose Island, Deschutes, as well as Belgian imports etc, but not comprehensive so be flexible.  Beer tags often have helpful reviews and summaries from Draft Magazine or Beer Enthusiast. I usually buy way too much, but like to sample a 6 pack of different brews I've never tried before. We've also bought specialty glasses and decanters from here, and their cigar room is also impressive.  Makes me feel like a kid in a candy store, and it's tough to walk out without salivating.

Surprisingly large and great park in the center of Chandler. A little of everything large aesthetically pleasing "lake" reservoir with many different species of ducks, nice palms and foliage around lake and walkways, tennis courts, lots of different duck species, and a train that rides around it all. Playground is also massive, and kids there were obviously loving it. Some kids seemed excited for when the water play-area is open again, I believe this is after May. Probably a little less than a top tier park, but surprising location and accessibility bumps this up to 5 star experience.

What can you say about this place that hasn't already been said. The hype is true, and we're lucky to have nationally renown chef Chris Bianco stay here in Phoenix all these years. Pizzas are perfect, and pastas are surprisingly great & fresh (if you can resist ordering a pizza). Menu is often changing and new additions and recommendations are usually worth taking. Have not yet been to the original downtown location, am intimidated by no reservations and what I expect to be long lines for a reputable place. The "Town & Country" location is fashionable shabby chic, not intimidating. Parking is kind of a cluster. Look forward to coming here again on the next possible date night.

We visit for healthier doggie food than most mass produced stuff, & the occasional dog toy. A great experience every time, and they get to know their customers to a surprising degree. Once I bought a toy plastic egg here, suggested by one of the employees, and when my wife returned that employee asked her how the dog was liking it. Go-getter attitude too, they always ask if they can help before you ask your first question. Bought a large bag of food today and the guy behind the counter insisted on carrying it to my trunk for me. A-plus service & good quality products.

Pretty much our go to place in the area if we have 2 hours to kill, are relatively hungry for something that won't clog our arteries, and need to get our toddler out of the house.   Biggest complement I can give: Out-of-town in-laws here months ago, with a few of them pickier than your average bear (for glutein free, organic, etc). We met them here when they first arrived thinking this was the best bet for finding a good match for them, and they kept coming back for nearly every meal. Seems to be a little something for everyone, and we bring a lot of others here for a nice casual meal.  First off the service has always been outstanding. It's obvious they make a real effort to give a good experience, and bringing our little boy here isn't as much a chore as some other places. Very kiddo friendly, always lots of high chairs, by default they give crayons to the kiddies, and the kids menu doubles as an activity page (connect the dots, coloring, etc). Kids menu is also great, you get to choose one thing from each of 4 food groups-think we got mac&cheese, tofu, broccoli, and corn this last time.   Restaurant is bright and relatively clean, and when it's not scorching hot, the outdoor patio is a nice setting. Portions are Mucho large, we're usually taking something home for each of us for dinner. Food is above average, but some aspects are hit or miss (Lavosh bread wraps are too starchy for my taste). I'm a big fan of their flatbreads (especially Chicken Fetoosh) and some salads (Lentil Fetoosh, Falafel, not chicken pasta). Jalapeño Cilantro hummus and most other hummus is a good bet, but the Ahi hummus misses the mark in my opinion. Pretty good handful of local beer options for a healthy place. Overall usually a positive experience, and we'll keep going back as the ol' local standard.

Great BBQ, do-it-yourself service, always leave satisfied and overly full. I've probably had better brisket, but am no expert, the turkey sandwich is top notch, buttered buns is a nice touch. A surprisingly good craft beer selection in ice buckets you snake past as you wait in line (Goose Island, San Tan, 4 Peaks etc). Service is bizarrely great-you only deal with employees at the counter, but they're extremely helpful and pleasant. Extra slices of bread, napkins, every condiment you can imagine are on the central table, and love the slop sink outside the bathroom so you can wash up & rinse BBQ sauce off as many times as you want without venturing into the loo. Rudy's BBQ sauce is the kicker, a little more spice than smoke, in my spice-loving opinion a great complement to the food & a nice souvenir to take home (Sissy sauce available for sissies). The typical BBQ cabin atmosphere, even a little more folksy than most BBQ places, but that adds to the no-nonsense charm. Will be back once my appetite recovers from this visit.

Was in and out with my initial visit in no time. Very friendly staff. Derm appointments are always difficult since the demand is so high, if they continue to be this efficient, I'll keep doing the right thing and coming in as often as suggested.

I'll start with the negative to get that out of the way: During off hours (just as they opened) we got what I hope was a brand-spanking-new-waitress, so even though she was extremely nice, I can't say the service from our point person was anything better than OK at best. The restaurant is much better than deserving of nit picking, and since she'll be better with a little time, my rating cuts some slack & overlooks some problems with 1 person's lack of experience (for the record: unopened beers without an opener, bread and olive oil coming out after appetizers, and having to take food to go because of an organizational error on her part-we asked for antipasti & pizzas at the same time, but didn't happen). We did have two rambunctious boys getting fussy, this waitress and everyone there were very understanding and friendly with them. In honesty, this is a very nice restaurant that we probably shouldn't be bringing kids to anyway, so some of the blame is ours. Besides her, everyone else seemed extremely competent.  However, the food was excellent, fresh with great ingredients. We started with the bruschetta, and although we had to split 2 pieces between 3 people, it was fresh throughout with quality mozzarella and buttery rich olive oil. The other appetizer, veggie plate with olive oil, was good-not-great, felt like I could make the exact same thing pretty easily at home. Bread on the table was standard warm Italian bread, and the olive oil provided was lacking or they forgot to bring out the good EVOO, but didn't eat much of the fillers so wasn't an issue.  Bonus points for chef and staff speaking to each other in Italian, also for Duvel on tap. Great cute date place, intimate setting, cool atmosphere and decorations. I'd rather come here than most other higher end places we've found in Phoenix.  Pizzas were fantastico! I've spent cumulative years in Italy, and this could be something you'd find there. Not sure if they import Neopolitan water like at some places, but whatever they're doing it seems very close to what you'd find in Campania. I got the Pizza Principe off the "classic pizzas" menu, crust was perfect thickness and salt level, sauce was fresh and tasty, prosciutto and arugula added salt and savor to it all, Parmesean rounded the edges of flavors off nicely. We got a pizza margarita for the kids, and I couldn't stop eating that either, again great crust and sauce, and not too much cheese. My wife couldn't stop raving about the "cheese-less pizza." Overall a very authentic and satisfying experience. Will be back, and even if it's a new waiter/waitress again, it'll still be worth it. Small place though, so might be a wait during weekend evening hours. Wish I had more time to try the home made Limoncello.

I'll preface by saying they are under new management for, currently, less than a month, and the bar area has a very nice atmosphere for hanging out or watching a game. Their beer selection, and whiskeys (to an extent), are also respectable. That said...  Seemed like workers didn't really feel like being there, were strangely reluctant to be attentive. Went during happy hour, at the bar, with just one or two other couples there, but despite 2-3 people behind the bar, it was still very difficult for my wife and I to get their attention. On one occasion she had to say "excuse me" three times even though the bartender was right in front facing away from us. Got our orders wrong on two occasions (they were nice enough to change our order after we had placed a different order-but this was also due to them not giving both the full + happy hour menus from the start). Bartender also didn't know what Campari was when trying to describe a drink, "that doesn't sound familiar." I hope they survive, there aren't many other places to escape & relax in the area, this was just kind of a disappointment & depressing experience for a $50 happy hour.

More a review for my wife than for me, but my experience exceeded expectations as well. She loves the Dr. Feelgood with beets added. Outstanding customer service, the owner knew who I was buying the drink for by the order and asked if we had our baby yet. A little pricey of course, but that's to be expected at an organic juice bar (it's surprising that some juice bars aren't organic).

Extra star for ambiance, star for happy hour specials and creative drinks, but that's about it for the upside. Weekend DJ added a place-to-be vibe, but the sushi fell pretty flat. Rolls were bland at best, disgusting at worst. The lobster roll was gross and left a nasty aftertaste I couldn't get rid of for a half hour. Will check this place out again for happy hour appetizers, but not planning on sitting and throwing down for a full check here again.
