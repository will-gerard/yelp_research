Some people go to McDonalds at midnight after a night out. But I make my way to the best juke box joint with the best burgers in town! Stupid good!

I go to PCG mostly for the corn bread, black bean soup and Macadamia nut chicken.   I tried the brunch menu for the first time today. Delish!! I had the highly-talked-about corn pancakes (w/ bacon). Served w/ real maple syrup, it was the perfect balance of sweet and savory! My friends had the breakfast enchiladas and the beef medallion eggs Benedict. Everything was very tasty! The price point is great too. Most of the dishes were $10.    Here's a tip: the tomatillo salsa served on the enchiladas has small bits of bacon in it. One friend is allergic to pork, and couldn't finish the dish once she discovered it.   This is a place with good food AND great service! I dine at PCG maybe every other month, but for some reason, I went a few times in a few weeks recently. Anyway, the guy that brings water to your table( before the server comes) not only brought the water but brought my "usual" iced tea also.... I was so impressed!!!

Great happy hour. Small, dark, divey vibe. Perfect for a romantic date or just low-key time with a couple friends. I've never been disappointed by the food but the wine list could use a makeover.

Hadn't been in a couple years and after such a fantastic meal, I had to slap myself!    Starting with the something as simple as the Italian bread which was warm, perfectly crusty on the outside and tender on the inside! Perfection.  Menu Special: off-the-bone  beef short ribs with a side of sauteed spinach and stuffed cannelloni. The short ribs were fork-tender, moist and perfectly seasoned. The cannelloni was simply amazing too.  Off the menu: Lasagna. Classic. Perfection!! I got full toward the end of it, but kept pushing like the little engine who could.   New York style cheesecake and Cappuccino for dessert. Perfect finish to a ferfect meal!   Sat at the bar for dinner and the service from Laura was awesome.   Some folks on Yelp have described the interior as outdated. True. Its not a hipster spot but I think that sort of adds to the charm  of the place.

Ummmm.....Mister distributor in Scottsdale! Where the h-e double-l is my rum raisin ice cream?? You have been out for a while now! Lost a star til its back.   I tried the Vanilla Honey Bee. Creamy and somewhat like French Vanilla at first bite. But then, you taste the subtle honey flavor. Its good,  but you should be a big honey fan... otherwise don't get it.

I like Merc for the dark, sexy, loungy atmosphere. I think its perfect for small groups to share a cheese platter and a bottle of Champagne. And when the music is hot....its hot!   Disclaimer if you've never been: it's situated across the corridor from Houstons (Camelback)  and I think the sign above the door merely says "Bar" or "Lounge".   Enjoy!

Mastro's has me so spoiled that I find Ruth's to be like a deflated balloon. I've never been a huge RC fan, but I think they used to be so much better once upon a time! At this price point, I can think of several much better steak houses!

When it comes to food and service, Houstons is as consistent as it gets!! This Hillstone Group restaurant should teach Fox Restaurant Concepts a thing or two about this notion.   Anywho.... I just wanted to let all Houstons soup fans know that they just changed the Sunday soup from Mexico City style to Mushroom Artichoke. =-0 I'm personally very disappointed with the removal of this favorite. However, I love mushrooms and artichokes. This soup is two thumbs up!   Bon Appetite!

Is anyone a big Bruschetta fan like me?? They have some of the most creative and tasty varieties...total palate pleaser! You have to order a bunch to share with friends. And I love the midday $5 wine specials! Oh, why not encourage a little day-drinking??!!! Hahaha!   Fantastically social and quaint atmosphere. You guys know I love the indoor/outdoor thing! :-) Its an old post office w/ what I believe are original wood floors. I love how they creak when you walk around. I especially like going at night when the candlelight is flickering throughout & groups of friends gather on sofas.  Enjoy!

Taylor's has such a refreshing cafe menu. I've been for breakfast far more often than lunch. I hope to try dinner soon b/c I think they feature live jazz on Wednesday nights.   I've never ever had a bad meal. In fact, I always have a hard time deciding. Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros, eggs Benedict (with a choice of meat), waffles & the Mexican omelet.   I never liked Bloody Marys until I had one at Taylor's! I tried a friend's once and have been hooked ever since! But if you want a less intoxicating beverage, try the iced chai latte. Careful, its so good you'll be ordering another before you know it!   Bon Appetite!

I know this place has been around forever and is well established in the Valley. But I think its about time for some CPR! Everything about this place inside and out screams old school...all the way down to the service staff's uniforms! Ummmm...has anyone else noticed that this place used to be their parent's old stomping grounds? That's cool but how but making it inviting for the 30-40 yr old crowd?   I had prime rib that was barely warm and I swear had the flavor of a dry piece of toast! The most bland Prime I've ever had. The "fresh" horseradish I requested on the side was even bland. My friend had the buffalo meatloaf (half buffalo/half ground sirloin). Now that my Dear Reader was a home run! Tender and full of flavor!  The ribs were decent and the "baseball" fillet was par at best also.   We went on a Friday night and were 4 of perhaps 20 other people in this huge place! The website reads like its scrumptous. When in fact, the experience was more like waiting in line at the new hot club only to find no one inside!   Oh....the only redemption was the desert. Pecan pie and their citrus creme brulee....Both make you rub your belly!!!  Bon Appetite!

I agree with some of the other reviewers. The food is great, but seems a bit over priced. Combo plates range between 7-10 bucks! For a corner "dive" with no waiter service, that seems a bit much.   The burros are delish! Something about the quality of the large tortillas they use. For starters, they're authentic. Not big, white, overly floury ones like you buy in the grocery. Folks must love 'em b/c they sell them in a package! The salsa bar is stocked w/ 3 different house made salsas, pico de gallo, and jalapenos w/ marinated carrots and onions. Not all salsas are made alike! I love theirs!   Enjoy!

I love their Philly cheesesteaks. The one thing that would make them better is if you had the option of Cheez Whiz. Folks from Philly will tell you that a cheesesteak isn't a cheesesteak without it!!! The bread is fresh and the meat is tender a flavorful. Deeee-lish!!  The seasoned fries and most of the sandwiches are pretty darn good too.   Great for lunch but you can't' be in a rush because there's always a wait.

I think Fleming's is the cat's meow! Great service!  Fantastic food! Interesting wine choices! I love that they offer wine flights. I don't know of any other steak houses in town do that (if anyone else does, please email me).   Shhhh....don't tell, but Flemning's is my 2nd fave after Mastro's!!  Bon Appetite!

Most people know Houston's. Its a good standby. The service is always great and I love how the servers work as a team. Houston's has fantastic burgers if you didn't know.   Tip: they serve a strawberry shortcake for dessert in the summer. Its perfect & not too sweet! The strawberries are gynormous and served atop a house made poppyseed shortcake w/ fresh whipped cream! Mouth watering yet?   Oh and one more tip: I don't know why they don't have this on the menu, but you can order beer-battered chicken fingers. Order extra crispy. Yum!   Bon Appetite!

Another Yelper said that Chocolate Star Bakery was sent from Heaven! I could not have said it any better!   I love that the Owner alternates cookie "specials" regularly yet keeps the old faithful standbys always in rotation. This week I got lucky to catch the current special chocolate mint cookie. Yep! Like a grown up Girl Scout cookie. All chocolate batter w/ dark chocolate chips and mint chips. I just polished one off w/ a steaming cup of truffled chocolate tea. But of course milk would be equally as good. :)  But no matter the cookie special, I ALWAYS get the pink cloud cookies. They're pink colored soft shortbread. And since pink IS one of my fave colors....  I frequently buy these cookies as personal and corporate gifts.  I always get delighted and excited responses! Just a hint for all you marketers out there. Stop it already with the mundane Panera Bread cookies in a box! :)  Enjoy!

Yeah guys,  this is definitely a breakfast spot. If you've never been....warning! You will wait a looong time on Saturday & Sunday morning. The huevos rancheros  and breakfast burrito (shown in photos) are slamming! The omelets are delish and the side of fruit is almost always sweet.  If I order lunch, I typically just get the grilled cheese and tomato soup. I must warn that the tomato soup is more brothy than creamy. The salads are ok but not worth the 45min table wait. The prices are great for the quantity and quality of the food (breakfast).     Bon Appetite!

Per the website: "In the English tradition, afternoon tea is served daily in the Lobby Tea Court. Voted "Best Afternoon Tea" by New Times and Arizona Republic readers, full tea includes finger sandwiches, scones with Devonshire cream and preserves, pastries and a selection of fine teas. Classical music provides a charming backdrop for a genteel afternoon break." I experienced this exquisite outing for my birthday one year. It was lovely and fun for a small group of women. It was like playing tea....but all grown up!   The Thirsty Camel Lounge lends a relaxing atmosphere with panoramic views of Phoenix and Paradise Valley. The piano player plays soulful and sultry sounds in the backdrop. I'm drawn to this bar by the views and atmosphere, not by the service which can be spotty and often disappointing.  The golf is great! Its a competitive course with awesome views! One of the most aesthetically pleasing in the area. I personally enjoy mango towel man! In the Summer, this guy comes around with iced cold mango-scented towels. He saved my butt when I played once in July. Yes, crazy I know!

Amazingly large and diverse wine selection and ever changing "flight" menu. The dark cozy atmosphere makes it a perfect date spot or casual hang w/ friends. Sometimes on crowded nights, its standing room only. But the crowd and music is great so you won't even notice.   Tip: Jazz on Monday & Thursday nights. Flemenco dancers on Sunday.  $5 cover on entertainment nights.

Pretty nice course and usually never exeptionally crowded. The staff is friendly good with small talk. If you schedule your tee time online, you can get half off the rates in the Summer.   Oh...and there'a a lady that works the walk up concession near the stairs to pro shop. This woman makes the best damn Bloody Marys (outside of a bar)! Perfect to either loosen me up to play or use as an excuse for playing poorly! Hahaha!

Fabulous views of Paradise Valley! Perfect for date or special occassion. Its a spa resort restaurant, so the menu is spa foo-foo, serving relatively small portions. Not good for the person who needs alot on their plate.   Not a huge fan of their breakfast, but the morning atmosphere can't be beat.

Atlas is a place for the foodies, the gastronomers, folks with a trained palate and the adventurous. Not your place if you need Buffalo wings, burgers and fries or a grilled chicken salad.   Like their website states: "Organic, hand foraged, local, wild, line caught, sustainable and exotic are just some of terms you will find on the menu that our chefs revise daily".  I love that!   The fun part is it's a BYOB restaurant...attached to a wine shoppe (AZ Wine Company). So if you don't bring your own, shop next door first. Wine pairing assistance available.   Reservations are HIGHLY recommended.

Went to Defalco's for lunch recently and was instantly consumed by the smell of fresh bread, garlic and sauces. Like walking into an Italian Grandmother's kitchen. Intoxicating.   The deli case stocked full of salami, pastrami and every other -ami you can imagine! There were olives, cheeses and already prepared dishes that you can eat there or take home. I ordered the cheese lasagna. You pay for it, take a number and wait. While waiting, let your eyes and senses shop the grocery area with all sorts of imported pastas, sauces  and other products.   You can't be in a rush with this place. About 10-12 minutes later, voila! My lasagna arrived to the table with a warm, crusty side of garlic bread. So damn good! I simply cannot wait to stop in again.   Bon Appetite~

I agree w/ reviewer N.T. in that I prefer Blue Nile over Lalibela b/c of the better atmosphere. Given the choice, I prefer to eat ethnic food in the way I would if at someones home in that country. So yes, part of the restaurant's seating is "traditional" and I like that. In fact, Blue Nile also serves more traditional beverages such as spiced tea and honey wine. In fact, if I remember correctly, you can even experience the traditional table hand washing at Blue Nile. So the the entire experience is more authentic and the food is fantastic. I love the fact that the food at Blue Nile isn't American-ized.   Like many other cultures, Ethiopians eat with their hands (not fork/knife). And here's a tip: you're supposed to place food in your mouth with your right hand only.   If you've never had Ethiopian food & you want to try something "safe", might I suggest the Doro Wat. Its (dark meat) chicken simmered in a spicy red curry. So good and a very common dish.   Enjoy!

I give this course 4 stars because of its challenge level. Not at all the most scenic golf course, but the gazillion hills create an extra level of difficulty. I'd bet money that this course was once a landfill (yes, it happens). No flat lands accept for the middle of the fairway and greens. I do love the golf attendants uniforms....old school with the argyle socks and knickers.

This was my second time at Spago. This time I've decided that Spago is SO over rated. Slap Wolfgang Puck's name on it and voila! Supposed to be fantastico, right? Errr....next!   The Pistachio Crusted Rack of Lamb came out well done and hard as a brick (asked for medium). The best thing about it was the Meyer Lemon Goat Cheese Orzo (I could have made a meal of).   The Pan Seared Duck Breast w/ White Corn Purée, Morel Mushrooms,Cippolini Onions, etc. was very good. Not fantastic, but good.  Roasted Organic Baby Beet Salad w/ Goat Cheese, Citrus and Petite Greens was thumbs-up! A smidge more goat cheese would have made it two-thumbs!   I am a thin crust, NY style pizza fan, so Spago's pizzas were a little too doughy and a "miss" for me.   Too many amazing restaurants in Vegas to give Spago, Las Vegas a 3rd try.

Best Moroccan food I've had since I was in London! I wish I could find something like this in Phoenix. If anyone knows of a great Moroccan place here, pleeeeze let me know.   Marrakech offers a set menu with several courses. Simply check out the pics one of the reviewers put up (kudos). No menu. Just a server swiftly giving you the run-down of what will be served. I believe the meal is $40/person.  I'm allergic to seafood and couldn't eat the shrimp scampi. They were very cool about substituting. I had sauteed mushrooms in garlic &  herbs. I dipped the peasant bread in the juices and OMG!! The hummus course was so good and so smooth that I literally want to hop on a plane right now just for a repeat!   By the 4th course I was stuffed, but the food was so damn good that I just kept going and going! This is one of those places the locals go. So I knew it would be great. Oh, and fellas, the belly dancers are awesome too!  Oh, and ask for Leo (server)!

I've GOT to give this Phoenix restaurant landmark another shot. First (and only) experience was far less than impressive. My steak was over cooked (ordered Medium) and the bartender/server was far too busy to check on us...not even once. Hell, I couldn't even get his attention when/if I wanted it.   My expectations were so high! When I pay a premium for food, I sorta expect premium in return. Will chalk it up to a bad night.

Another Phoenix gem!   Don't expect hard-shell tacos, refried beans and Spanish rice here! Instead, expect bold flavors, fresh ingredients and Chef-inspired regional Mexican cuisine.   Table-side guacamole here is a must and some menu items are seasonal. The probability of a wait is high, but worth it.   Happy hour (half off drinks) is only from 2-5 pm.   Delish!! Enjoy!

Not a sushi fan (actually I'm allergic...I know it sucks) but all my friends rave about Sapporo's sushi. I CAN speak on the Teppan Yaki dishes which are quite yummy. I haven't had a bad meal to date and I've been countless times.   Their Happy Hour menu is quite extensive and impressive with way more goodies than most other restaurants (take a peek at it on their website). If my "F*#! the Recession" List were giving awards, Sopporo's HH menu might just win one!!!   P.S. If you've never been, its SUPER crowded Thurs-Saturday  Enjoy!

I adore truly authentic Italian cuisine and I think Mike O. sums it up well. Daniel really does understand the essence of traditional Italian food. I've had fine Italian cuisine all around the world (including Europe) and the lasagna (his Grandmother's recipe) is still some of the best! The prices reflect the quality of the food and the servers are always right on the money with wine pairings.   I've entertained friends and clients from around the country and around the world at Daniels. I've NEVER heard one single complaint. Now I'm not going to say that they are incapable of error, and after reading Paul G's review, I was hoping he'd give Daniel's another try. Then upon reading the rest of his reviews, I now see his frame of reference. Ummmm....let's see...he gave chain restaurants Z Tajas & Grand Luxe 5 stars!! I like Z and Grand Luxe too but, c'mon.....really? Real Foodies....help me out here!   Bon Appetite!

The lamb kisra (basically a pizza or flatbread) is soooooooo damn good! The salad selection will make even the most focused foodie indecisive. Not because there are too many selections, but b/c they're all so interestingly delish!   The atmoshpere is super cool and funky. Great for small groups.  This restaurant group is known for their out-of-the-box menus. Unfortunately however, the service can sometimes be spotty.

Great happy hour. $5 tapas/wine/cocktails. It had been a long time since my last time there and had to ask myself why?! Tapino! I've missed you! The chef does an excellent job in food presentation & originality. But more than that, the flavors pop in your mouth.   Must try: crab corn dogs (so nostalgic), duck tortillas, yucca frites to name a few.   I must agree w/ another reviewer. The outdoor patio is the place to be. The waitstaff is usually outstanding too!   Bon Appetite!

I love Pita Jungle's food (service is another story)!! Never had a bad meal. And what I love most of all is the lemon dressing they use on the Greek salad. It's soooo light and refreshing. The only thing I don't like is that they don't serve pepperochini with it. I could eat those things whole! Pita Jungle where are my peppers??  Anyway, as far as the service, I've gotta agree w/ Robert A. At both the Shea and Indian School locations, the service is very spotty. In fact, I was just at the Shea location last night, and after being seated outside...in the sun....we were not greeted by our server for 7 min! Ummmm....no water....no iced tea.....not even a "hello I'll be right with you"!!! On the flip side, the kitchen is lightening fast. No kidding, our food was at our table shortly after we finally got our iced tea!  The Indian School location is worse for service. Because the location is so small, its like the servers are pissy just so you'll want to leave and they can rotate your table!

Was at a friend's house yesterday and the food was catered by EG. I'm from the Detroit area and so is my friend, her hubby and about half the people at the party. With so many AUTHENTIC Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food restaurants in the Detroit area, we know the good stuff when we taste it! And Eden's Grill is legit!!   On the menu was Fattuchee salad, Falafal, vegetarian Domeh (stuffed grape leaves), Hummus, Tzatiki (cucumber/yogurt dip) & tender, savory Basmati rice with golden raisins.   Everything was amazing and so fresh! Gotta love family-owned restaurants that do it right.   Enjoy.

Not much to say about Lola's. Its cute. Its quaint. And the food it utterly delish and authentic. Oh, but bring a sweater....they  usually have the air on "Polar Bear"!  The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 is b/c of  the freezing temp and the community seating. Doesn't bother me....well, maybe just a little. Can be a bit noisy and bad for private conversation.  Bon Appetite!

The Proprietor took the time to visit dozens of locations around Southern Italy to come up the rich design of Sacci. As their website states, "this fine dining experience transports you to the hospitality of an Italian farmhouse, which has flourished into a classic villa in every sense of the word".  Each room has a uniquely different feel. They include an Italian cucina, an old world library....very masculine with stone fireplace or outside patio overlooking elevated,  panoramic views of the Valley.   I enjoy my meals every time. But I must admit, the service is usually par at best....very disappointing for the caliber of restaurant this is.

Haven't had dinner at O&I in quite a while and was very pleased with the Watermelon Salad (with avocado, goat cheese, red chili gremolata) that I enjoyed. True Foods has a delish watermelon/heirloom tomato salad on their menu, so I asked my server to add heirlooms to my salad. It came out FANTASTIC! I almost licked the plate! The light vinegairette dressing complimented by the red chili gremolata was a perfect balance of sweet and spicy. Very light and refreshing starter or meal.

Like Mastro's City Hall, always great food and service!  Similar menu as City Hall just more emphasis on seafood. If it makes a difference to anyone, I find that City Hall draws a slightly younger crowd (30's) than Ocean Club.  Bon Appetite!

Its really sad to hear John S. factor parking while rating the food at Tarbell's. Perhaps he should have spent an additional couple dollars to valet; and olive oil served w/ bread instead of butter isn't really as "fashionable" as it is traditional, esp at Italian restaurants.   One of my all-time favorites there are the spaghetti and meatballs. One of their signature dishes and probably some of the best I've had in town!  Our service last night was outstanding....as usual! The place is indeed small. Reservations on the weekend are necessary well in advance. So its easy to imagine that they try to turn tables quickly. No excuse, however, for a customer feeling rushed.   Otherwise, the pasta dishes are especially fantastic and worth a small inconvenience.   Bon appetite!

Great spa. Got a deep tissue massage and my therapist was just ok! The decor is typical of most better quaility Vegas hotels. Very nice with lots of attention to detail.

I decided to go with their namesake sandwich...the Vermonter. It was really good. I had 1/2 sandwich 1/2 side of cole slaw. The slaw was good but not great. I wished I had ordered the whole sandwich! I'll be back!

My friend introduced me to Uncorked some time ago. Before then, I had driven by a thousand times but never had a clue what a hidden Scottsdale gem this place was.   Really great happy hour, lunch and wine specials. One of those local "joints" that will always have a familiar face in the house time and time again.   Enjoy!

Sometimes you can disguise mediocre food with nice packaging. That's Sol Y Sombra. Over priced for what you get. I've NEVER left there feeling like....wow....I just had a fantastic meal. Very disappointing.

Can I just say WOW!   The warm and rustic atmosphere and friendly service invited me even before being seated.   I sat at the (4 seater) bar facing the open kitchen and chatted w/ Cole while I waited on friends. Love the open kitchen! Cole was busy shoving entrees into/out of the hearth oven but made me feel like the only customer in the place...and like the oven wasn't a gazillion degrees. Now that's a professional!   I started w/ celery and apple soup. Sweet, savory and creamy. For entree I had the vegetarian rice bowl that was packed full of flavor and so colorful w/ white and purple cauliflower, brussel srouts, black rice and more. I can't wait to go back for the pork stew w/ cornbread. Rumor has it that its reeeealllly good!   Oh, and I'm not a big fan of sticky toffee pudding. But I tried theirs, and now I'm a cheerleading fan!  Bon Appetite!

Anytime a restaurant can get me to come back twice in the same week....now that's amore'!   This time I had pot roast which is not on the online menu. Not just any ole' pot roast. Succulent and pan seared w/ reduced juices like chefs do short ribs. OMG (licking fingers right now)! Its served open-faced on Texas toast and all w/ all the traditional pot roast veggies. But as anyone will tell you, I can usually figure out a way to up the ante on a dish. So! Instead of Texas toast, I asked for it to be served atop of their roasted corn polenta....Au jus gravy dripping down the sides of the polenta mound. Oh Yeah! I see you licking your chops!   My server told me "no" to substituting the Texas toast. So... again...sitting at the "kitchen counter" as usual....I just looked at Cole and gave him the pouty face. He said "Ok"! :))  My friend had the Fred Flintstone sized pork chop...that was deeee-lish! But we both agreed that mine was better (wink).   No desert this time. More vino was my desert. I must have had the last of their Patz and Hall Pinot Noir on my last visit. Nooooo.....I wasn't driving. Lol  Bon Appetite!

I only have a funny story to tell about this place. Actually about the name. I'm from MI and we don't have Chic-Fil-A. So, I'm driving along one day shortly after moving to AZ, and I pass my first ever Chic-Fil-A. As as I glanced at this hyphenated,  almost-cursive written brand name, I said out loud "Chica Flicka!? What  kinda place is that?" I even went so far as to call a friend from here and asked...."Tracy, what the hell is Chicka-Flicka"?" After being dumbfounded for a minute, she figured it out and said "NO silly, its Chic-Fil-A"!! To date, I still call it Chica-Flicka cuz its sooooo much more funny to say!!!   Oh, and as fast food goes, its pretty good! I never eat fast food, so I don't really know how to rate! :-)

Ohhh if only I could stop ordering the Corner Chop salad, I can get around to trying some other things on the menu!!   Corner Chop: Mixed greens, red grapes, blue cheese, smoked turkey, candied pecans, poppy seed dressing.   I asked one of the employees about the carrot cake and he said it's some of the best he's ever had. "No kidding", he said. Of course I HAD to try it. Verdict: it may not be the multiple layer carrot cake I'm used to, but OMG was it delish!! It was indeed some of the best carrot cake ever. Tip: purchased in the refrigerated case - it's best enjoyed at room temp.   Oh, and don't forget their morning 50 cent cup of Jo.   Enjoy!

Last week I revisited RM for the first time in a long while. I was quite impressed w/ the updated, fresh new look. Its sexier with tons more visual texture. They now serve regular entrees and they were great! No more over-priced, tapas-wannabe!! Yipeee!

Stumbled upon Switch for lunch last week and what a pleasant stumble it was! The atmosphere felt reminiscent of FEZ also located in central Phoenix and also one of my fave dives. I asked someone and sure enough, it was. So I knew I was going to have a fantastic lunch.   The 3 of us arrived in the heat of lunch hour but were seated quickly....a mere 5 minutes. Our server arrived promptly and took our drink orders. The Sangria was calling my name but I decided to behave and order iced tea instead. Two of us ordered iced tea and my server was insightful enough to bring a carafe.  Cool points for this. I hate waiting for refills!   The problem with a menu in which everything sounds good, you can't decide on anything! And I couldn't decide! So with desperation in my eyes, I asked my server for a suggestion. He recommended the APRICOT BBQ CHICKEN SANDWICH w/ warm sliced chicken, shredded spinach, cilantro and red onion on warm ciabatta bread. OMG! This sandwich was so flippin' good! You know....it tasted like a bbq chicken pizza ....but as a sandwich. There! That's the best description. Biting in is wonderfully messy though...ask for extra napkins.   My colleagues ordered the CLASSIC HAMBURGER and the COUNTRY CLUB TURKEY PANINI. Both delicious. But my sandwich took home the prize by far!   Lunch hour ran like a well oiled machine. No super long waits for seating, service or food. Things you appreciate when short on time.   HAPPY HOUR 7 DAYS A WEEK 4:00-6:30p HALF OFF MARGARITA SUNRISE, BLONDE OR RED SANGRIA, CAIPIRINHA (Ky-per-ee-nah) $3 HOUSE WINE & BEER 6:30-Midnight Daily   Bon Appetite!

You've got to have the cantaloupe martini! Or any of their martinis as a matter of fact. They're creative...the Cosmo is so played out!   From the bar, you'll get panoramic view of Paradise Valley. Fantasic at sunset! Its cozy and fun. I love to bring out of town guests and clients here.

I used to be a huge fan of the cantaloupe martini, but I was there last week and it just wasn't the same. Either the new bartender didn't do it justice or they changed the recipe. Either way, I'm a bit hesitant to try it again now. Jade, please tell me you  haven't lowered your standards of excellence!

I have a very short list of great burger spots in the Valley....and Stax just made that list! I love the just-a-bit-larger-than-a-slider sized burgers. The varieties include beef to the not so ordinary ostrich & lamb. I had one turkey & one veggie burger. Usually, my problem with either of those burger types is the mushy texture. But both burgers were amazing! The turkey burger was the perfect texture & was seasoned to perfection! The veggie was not some disqusting soy patty w/ fake grill marks! Nooooo! I saw real whole kernel sweet corn in there! I'm tellin' you, it was good! Take it from a girl who typically loathes veggie burgers!  Can't wait to try the lamb & buffalo next.   I topped off my would-be healthy dinner with...(drum roll please).....a basket of onion rings!! Big & sweet and not greasy. Just the way I like 'em! One thing I don't like is they serve the onion rings &/or fries before the burgers. If you try to get them served together (I have) the fried items come out slightly on the cool side. Hmmm....Wonder what that's all about?   Did I mention the extensive half-bottle wine list? Stax is great for a casual date or hanging w/ a group of friends.   The service was great & the staff super friendly. Two thumbs up!

I hate being so critical of new places. Especially when they seem to be owned/operated by Mom/Pop. I did the $10 wine taste with a friend and I must say...it was perhaps the worst wine I've had in a very long time! Like Kristin S, said, who stores wine in plastic jugs? Reminiscent of a water cooler bottle!    If your idea of good wine is some that comes in a box or is called "Arbor Mist" or "White Zinfandel" , this may be the place for you! But if you're a true wine enthusiast, or collector perhaps, its not!

Lunch: Out of friend chicken. Only pork chops available. Two of the side dishes I wanted to order were "out" too. Me thinks not. Didn't order anything. Left and went to LoLo's.   The owner of LoLo's is Mrs. White's Grandson. At least he knows how to run a restaurant.

I'm allergic to seafood/fish. So I could very well be disqualified for reviewing this restaurant. However! And its a big however! They have the yummiest banana pudding this side of the Mason-Dixon line! Where is that by the way??!! LOL! Seriously, it comes served in a Mason jar and if you don't finish it all ( I never do), they give you the lid to close it up and take it home! I guess I could share it....but noooo!!

I'm with Matthew R. I'd put City Hall up against any Steakhouse in town!  The service is consistent I always feel special. The couple times I have had a problem, management/waitstaff are extremely responsive and accommodating. I frequent CH sometimes upwards of 3x a month, so a problem here or there is nothing.  I will say this for the calorie conscious eater, nothing is low-cal! Ok maybe the steamed asparagus and broccoli. But if you want less butter in your sauteed spinach...or cheese in your cauliflower gratin.... just ask!  Bon Appetite!  Natalie's F*#! the Recession Tips:  Since the portions are so large anyway...split it!! Sometimes I go alone or with a friend after work and sit at the bar.  When I'm not in the mood for a big meal, I just order off the appetizer menu. The Steak Sashimi ($12) is delicious and quite filling actually. This app is soy marinated steak sliced and served over wasabi mashed potatoes. Sometimes I'll add an app-sized salad and I'm gooooood!!

Blue Adobe is a little blue sapphire in the rough!   The service was prompt and courteous.  The complementary chips and salsa were yummy....but I wish they had a hot salsa option. I went for lunch, and had the portobello mushroom enchalada with rice and beans.  The enchalada was very rich with Adobe cream sauce and cheese. It had a very unique flavor....oddly familiar. I couldn't pin point it until I asked. It was ameretto. Ahhh!! That's it! The ameretto added a distinct flavor, but I think it was almost overpowering. Just a tad less would've been nice! The rice and (pinto) beans were flavored to perfection!   The New Mexican cuisine was a delight!  Enjoy!

Sadly, I must agree with most of the negative reviews. Once our food was  served, our waiter never checked in on our party of 6 to ask if everything was ok. Not once! In fact, I had to flag someone else down for a pepper grinder. The poorly constructed wine list was extremely over priced. Last I checked, when you buy a $100 bottle of wine, the server should pour when your glass is low. We poured our own wine refills...everytime. Another thing....in the process of one of the male hosts carrying a chair to another table, he dropped the seat cushion on my head! He had to raise the chair above our heads as he walked  between our table and the glass wall. Who does that!?   I had such high hopes for this place. It certainly has fabulous atmosphere! Probably one of the best atmosphere concepts in town. But the waiters must have been recruited from Applebees!  When I asked how the Osso Bucco was, my server told me "hit or miss". What? Hit or miss? Not even McDonald's is hit or miss! The 3rd level music/bar area was the only saving grace for the evening. Get it together Estate House!

Round of applause for Executive Chef Gio Osso, who has transformed The Estate House's once ho-hum dining experience to something magnificent!   Like another reviewer stated, the bread was perfect. Light, airy, flavorful and perfectly crunchy on the outside. I started with the heirloom tomato di parma. Served w/ prosciutto on grilled toast points and fresh, hand pulled mozzarella. Ask for a little sea salt and cracked pepper to bring out the flavors. Yum!   For entree I ordered hand made fettuccine w/ wild mushrooms and white truffle oil. Fresh pasta is unbeatable! The texture of the noodles and taste of the delicate flavors were divine.    The Grilled Colorado lamb w/ chestnut torte and thyme roasted figs was the perfect treat for holiday season. The lamb was perfectly prepared and delicate in flavor. The chestnut torte has a mild gingerbread taste and texture. I really appreciated the creativity of this dish.    To top off the meal, we had bourbon bread pudding w/ pecans and malted rum gelato. I've had many bread pudding in my day. Its one of my favorite desserts. However, this was one of the best ever! It wasn't brick-heavy or too sweet like many (failed) attempts at this Southern favorite. The portion size wasn't outrageous either....I actually appreciated this.  Our server, Jeff,  has tons of restaurant experience and is a quite knowledgeable, attentive server. Visit the Upstairs Lounge for after dinner drinks and pit fire relaxation if you have time.   F*#! the recession (see my list):   Summer Special : Two 3-course pre-fixe menus for $20 or $30.   Bon Appetite!

Listen.....this ain't your average Mexican food restaurant. No Spanish rice and refried beans here! As the website states, its neuvo Mexican (with a bit of Cuban flare and culinary influence in my opinion). Oh, speaking of website. Theirs is just as enticing as the food. It's like a music video with a menu. It's sexy and food photography is amazing.  Check it out!   I started with guacamole and salsa. Yum! The red Sangria was one of the best I've had in a long time. Not overly sweet with a nice kick! The (vegetarian) chile relleno was amazing! Stuffed with roasted zucchini,  onions and potatoes. The perfectly spicy ancho chilie was nicely contrasted with the sweetness of the veggies inside.   My only complaint was that I had to ask my server for a fresh order of corn pudding b/c it was over done.  If you're familiar from Southern corn pudding, its not really like that. Theirs is thin and more dense like corn bread. But very delish!   All the food was great and the atmosphere was rather unexpected for a restaurant in Tempe Marketplace. I was transported to another place. Refreshing.   Bon Appetite!

Eddie's house has a lovely, cozy atmosphere. The menu was American....I think. Unlike some Phoenix Yelpers, I'm pretty neutral about Eddie Matney's  food and creativity. He's good but over rated definately. His style seems to be all over the place.  His creations aren't consistent. Nor are they consistently good.  My friends and I had several so-called tapas which include: spaghetti egg rolls. What? They sound interesting and creative, but were weird in flavor and texture. They were basically rolled up and fried plain spaghetti on top of a peanut sauce. Ugh! Didn't fly!!!   We had lamb chops on top of hummus and a few decorative french fries. The lamb chops were decent but we had to send them back b/c  the poor lamb was still crying "baaaahhhhhh"!

Caribbean Fusion is good, but needs a little menu tweaking.   I went there totally expecting beef patties on the menu. After I already ordered my Jerk Pork, I asked if they would eventually serve them. The other server (not my server) said..."oh, we have them". Huh?? Where? They certainly weren't on the menu or mentioned when I ordered. All I really wanted was a couple beef patties, some plantains and genuine ginger beer! I ordered the beef patties (abandoned my jerk pork) and ate the plantains I ordered with my pork dish. The patties were delish and so were the plantains. The jerk pork was flavorful but a little on the tough side.   Simply put, the menu was great with the Jamaican dishes. They went awry by adding Italian style pasta dishes and salads with no Jamaican flare, American side dishes....like corn on cob, baked potato and french fries.   They're not super busy yet, and could probably do better by narrowing the selection to a few stellar and genuine Jamaican dishes. Oh, by the way, the website is www.jamicanfusions.com (Fusion with an "s", unlike the spelling of the restaurant).   On the lighter side, I know a great Mojito, and theirs are fantastic!!!   Bon Appetite!

I usually don't entertain friends/business associates at restaurants that I've never been to (I hate to be disappointed over a recommendation). But I was overjoyed with NOCA.   I started with the heirloom beets which is not on their online menu. It was amazing and the beets tasted like candy! My main entree was the Tagliatelle w / San Marzano tomato sauce, oregano and Pecorino.   My only disappointment was that I expected the interior design to have a little more umph or urban flare. But hey, I quickly forgot about all of that once my starter arrived!   Bon Appetite!

Just like before they moved, great food, spotty service.   For starters, I walked in alone and asked if my other party had arrived. She said 'No'. Ok....no problem. I immediately became distracted by a gal I knew that works there. We chatted for about 3-4 minutes. I said, hey, by the way, can you check to see if my party has arrived? She did a quick check on their  computer and said "oh yes, they're here". Wow!!! Quickly got over being annoyed and was directed to the table.   Oh, my! I just love what you've done with the place!  The decor is funky and hip. Lots of clean lines and interesting textures.    For appetizer, I got the assorted beet salad w/ goat cheese and roasted pistachios. The presentation alone made my mouth water. It could've been roasted shoestring and I would have eaten it! LOL! The plates are large, white  and square with contrasting angles. Makes any dish look 50% better. The app was great! The goat cheese melted in my mouth and the beets were perfectly sweet on their own.   So I got the Friday special which is braised lamb shank w/ assorted root vegetables. To my surprise it was also garnished w/ wild mushrooms. This would have been nice to know... as so many folks don't like or are allergic to mushrooms. The lamb was fall off the bone tender and flavorful. The root veggies were amazing!   Sidekicks: The side of steamed asparagus was over-done. The mac and cheese rivals City Hall's. I said RIVALS. Not beat. Rivals. You know how I adore my Mastro's City Hall Mac n Cheese!!! The creamy polenta was top notch! Last but not least, the sauteed spinach was yummy in the tummy also.   Let's go back a bit. The 12oz filet was good. Not steakhouse good. But good.   One more step back, the Pinot Noir the server suggested (from CA) was good. A little sweet for my taste, but good. I should have known better and trusted my own instincts b/c he didn't seem to know much about his wine list and the characteristics of each wine. Oh, and did I mention that he never came back to fill wine glasses!?! Geeze dude! I can't say he was new b/c I didn't ask. I just know that Christophers has NEVER been on my top list for great service. Just great food.   Bon Appetite!

J Alexanders has come to town....and its like Santa coming! JA coming with all its goodies! I'm a JA regular in Michigan and I've been at the  doors every week like a bad Mervyns commercial!!! Open! Open! Open! (kidding). They finally opened today I'm told more busy than expected.    J Alexanders serves American-style food with a contemporary twist. They fit somewhere between casual and fine dining and the atmosphere is enhanced by dark woods, indoor/outdoor bar and interesting textures.  For Houstons fans, JA has a strikingly similar atmosphere and menu. Legend has it that the original owners of Houstons split and started JA. I personally like the JA menu better. From the colossal onion rings on the appetizer menu to their always classic and perfectly juicy prime rib.    You may see some similarities to Houstons, but don't expect the "famous" Houston's spinach dip. JA's is a queso dip (w/ a little spinach).  As I understand it, they try to tweak their menu to regional markets. If that's so, they have to add more flavor to the queso dip. It was terribly lacking in flavor. Folks in this region expect their Southwest style dishes be full of flavor! Kick it up a notch! One friend had the blue cheese topped filet Mignon and another the pork loin...both very good.   The wine list is reliable and pleasing. Many well known labels integrated with some interesting less known. If you're a lemonade lover (Arnold Palmer for DA kid) try their fresh squeezed. Ah! I tell you....they bust their butts for this simple childhood favorite.   If you're a carrot cake fan...you've gotta have it!   My friends and I sat at the bar to watch some Monday night football and our servers Chris and Brittany were friendly and attentive. Tell them I said "hello"!   Bon Appetite!

Wildly popular Sushi Roku is now in Scottsdale at the W Hotel.  It's atmosphere is ornate and blends organic textures setting the stage for  freshly-prepared sushi and sashimi fare.   The food goes beyond the expected and blends ingredients such as jalapeño peppers into more traditional Asian fare giving a unique touch to every dish. The bar serves up some wild concoctions that will surely cure what ails you, and there's a good selection of sakés and a creative wine list.    Since I went to Sushi Roku last night without a reservation, my friend and I ponied up to the bar. We were greeted by a team of very knowledgeable and service oriented bartenders. Dylon offered some fantastic food recommendations. Oh, and ladies...he's total eye candy! He was very attentive and took care of us even as the bar got busier.   Stephani cured my ailments with one of the most unique and delish martini's I've had in a long time! It was the Passion & Spice martini. It's made w/ Skyy Passion vodka, muddled jalapeno, orange juice and some other secret "sauces"!  Its sweet (but not overly sweet) w/ a slightly spicy finish. If I had a tail it would be wagging over this drink!  My friend had the Strawberry Fizz martini created with muddled fresh strawberries. Very summertime!! Caution: these drinks go down easy!    The edamame hummus appetizer is refreshingly unique. It's made with black edamame and the beans are only vaguely darker, yet sweeter than the familiar green.  Their creamy, buttery texture easily adopts the flavor and spices of traditional chickpea hummus. It's served with 3 dipping chip varieties: fried won ton, lotus and sweet potato. Yum-O!   I also indulged in the Filet Mignon wrapped jumbo asparagus w/ Soy Mirin Sauce (served tapas style) and the mixed veggie tempura.  The flavors were perfect and the drinks compliment these creative dishes.   With it's critically acclaimed Modern Japanese fare and Zen-like atmosphere, Sushi Roku will be a favorite among both locals and visitors.

I'm a fan of any place with Tito's as their  "well" vodka. In fact, that's the ONLY vodka they pour! Whoo-hoo! Another nice touch was their house made mixers (tonic, ginger ale, sour mix & lemonade).   Tuck Shop is a tiny old house converted to a local gem. It's tucked away (pardon the pun) in a Central Phoenix neighborhood and you'll drive by and miss it if you're not paying attention.   We started with a Tito's and house made ginger ale chorizo stuffed Medjool dates for appetizer. The sweet & savory experience was unexpected and very delightful. I almost ate the entire app alone!   For dinner, I ordered the citrus-brined chicken and white cheddar waffles. It's served with spicy grilled string beans. The chicken was juicy and tender and the waffles were surprisingly different. The one thing missing for me was syrup. I asked my server about it. He said the chef wanted to go with more of a dinner dish and that syrup would have been too breakfast-y. Au contraire mon frere!!!! Maple based syrup is part of the the complexity of the dish! Chef could have figured out something a savory syrup recipe! And franky, without it, the dish was on the dry side.   My friend had the Catfish & Crawfish w/ polenta. I didn't try it, but the plate was pretty darn clean!   Enjoy!

Like another reviewer so pointedly stated...."Is this what Heaven is like"? I second that emotion. I've experienced my fare share of 5-star spas all over the world. But the overall attention to detail in every way blew me away!    Upon check in, I was given the typical tour of the facilities. But this is not just any tour. Its also an interactive experience. Like telling about a movie, I won't spoil the surprise. But I was quite impressed.   The decor included mostly Moroccan influences and there are 2 spa service waiting areas. One services is your typical room with teas, water, light snacks and magazines. The Moroccan theme boasts ceilings that are textured with silks and fabrics. The red velvet, textured couches complete the theme. The second waiting area is the "whisper room'. This extremely low lit room has chair seating and a string of firm 4-post beds to relax before, between or after your services. The white sheers on the beds can be pulled closed for more privacy. There are no distractions. No TV. No chatter. You are just left with yourself and your thoughts.   I had a facial and a deep tissue massage. Like spas, massage therapists are hit/miss at times. Especially when it comes to something as special as sports massage. I was so lucky to experience the services of Jean-Baptiste. Who within the first 2 minutes of my therapy, I tell it was going to be a great 50 minutes!! Right away I recognized his technique as something special. He later told me that he trained in Nice, France and incorporated sports medicine techniques into my massage. Let me warn you....if you are not used to deep tissue/sports massages, don't let him be your first. He's highly advanced and will wake up body parts you didn't know you had! Instead, use him for therapy that's a little more mild. With that said, he quickly advanced to the top 3 of my best massages ever!   My facial was done by Mandy Visser. She too was very good and I looked 5 years younger once she was done with me. What woman can complain about that?   Overall, there's no way I can name all of the small details that make this spa so special. From amazing views at the spa pool to the artistic glass/ceramic tile on the wall in the bathroom stall, Joya spa is a little slice of heaven on earth!   Enjoy!

At first I was hesitant about trying Prado out because of some of the reviews. I got the impression that I may in for a hit-or-miss experience. And it was my fear that I'd catch one of their "miss" days. I was pleasantly surprised when I had an absolutely sublime meal!   Since the menu changes nightly, I won't bore you with details of the meal. I'm a huge fan of restaurants using local, organic produce &/or meats....and I'm a bigger fan of Prado b/c of this!   The resort and the restaurant is extremely sexy! You really do feel as if you've traveled to Spain. I encourage people to take advantage of the local gem!!  Bon Appetite!

Who would have imagined that in the heart of the Grayhawk area, I'd find a quaint creole restaurant?? I mean, nothing about the name suggests Creole or Louisiana style nosh. But boy am I glad!!   A g'friend and I went to Jaspers for lunch yesterday. We were greeted very warmly and seated promptly. There wasn't a crazy lunch-hour wait, so it makes a great spot if you need to conduct a lunch meeting or are short on time.   I wanted to sit on the outdoor patio to enjoy the lovely weather. However,  it was a bit chilly in the shade yet too hot in the direct sunlight. So our server was gracious enough to turn on the overhead heating lamps. Ahhhhh! Now that's more like it.   Now this is gonna sound boring, so bare with me. My friend and I ordered the same thing for lunch! I know, what fun is that for my virgin experience there? But it was a lunch special and we couldn't resist!  We ordered the bbq pulled pork sandwich on warm chabatta bread. It comes with creamy, thick-cut cole slaw on the side. But I wanted to enjoy my pulled pork sandwich Memphis style...cole slaw ON the sandwich! On the side was a pickled, caramelized onion chutney that I also put on the sandwich. Yum-O!! A side of fries comes with the sandwich too. But not just any ole' fries! These were thick-cut and subtly seasoned regular fries tossed with sweet potato fries. What a perfect marriage! This little surprise isn't mentioned on the menu just FYI. The meals came out promptly and were perfect lunch sized portions.   Listen, its rare for me that a desert eclipses an entree. But it did! The house-made Key lime pie is probably the best I've ever had.....ever! I order key lime pie any time I see it on a menu and therefore have had my fair share. Jasper's Key lime is a double layer pie. The bottom is a traditional creamy, tangy layer. The equally thick  top layer is light, airy and creamy with wonderful specks of lime zest. The unfussy graham cracker crust is perfectly sweet and buttery. I can't say enough about this slice of heaven. You'll just have to try it yourself!   Jaspers Peak is owner operated and managed and they're simply great people!  You won't be disappointed!   I took my own advice Monday and conducted a dinner meeting at Jaspers for after work meeting. This go round, I had the chicken & andouille gumbo. Good thing for me, the stock is chicken based. I love this place b/c they always surprise me. My bowl of gumbo had a center of creamy grits. The sausage could have been a bit more spicy in my humble opinion. But that didn't stop me from damn near licking the bottom of the empty bowl!    Bon Appetite!

I love love love the chicken & hummus appetizer. Its served w/ sauteed spinach and pita. Although its an app, its large enough for a light meal. Most times, I get that w/ the beet salad and split it w/ a friend. Perfect.   For those of you who avoid beets, I think you'll change your mind w/ this salad. The beets are sweet like candy.  Served w/ feta, mandarin oranges, candied pecans and a very unique pear dressing, you forget you're eating healthy. I've been trying to harvest the pear vinaigrette recipe forever!!! They won't give up the secret sauce! :(   Enjoy!

Chef Michael deserves 5 stars, but I was only able to give up 4 because of the my slow server. Once we were seated, he came to the table pretty quickly to take our drink order. We ordered bottled water. But since I also wanted wine I asked for a few more minutes to review the selection. I needed a FEW minutes. Not 15 minutes. Note, the restaurant opens at 5:30 and we arrived around 6:30. There were only 3-4 other tables seated.   The menu changes monthly. A few things carry over month to month while some entrees are simply prepared differently. What I like about Heirloom is their use of local, organic produce. Thumbs up for supporting the local farmer! The menu is also split into 5 courses (incl desert). My server suggested ordering at least 2.   For my 1st course I chose the heirloom beet salad with Black Mesa Chèvre and Chianti tossed arugula & mâche. My 2nd course was orange-honey roast duck on spaghetti squash and duck confit with Chestnut Purée. What a great play on the seasonal palate right?   My friend chose 2 of their signature dishes: heirloom tomato soup with "pestoed" white beans and the grilled Colorado "Lamb T-Bone" with eggplant, red pepper, olive caponata and mint pesto. We also ordered the heirloom fingerling potatoes a la carte to share. They didn't arrive with the meal. Oops. There goes the server again!   While my meal was absolutely divine, I must admit that I could not stop eating my friend's lamb. Far from the usual ho-hum rack of lamb. This T-bone was unbelievably flavorful and creatively prepared. The mint (very subtle) pesto drizzled on the tender mild lamb sent my taste buds into orbit!!! I'm going back just for that dish asap! My BV Tapestry red vino completely rounded off the experience. The wine had a great nose full of black cherry and currant notes. Perfect for either dish!   Save room for desert because their signature custard-filled "cake doughnuts" on lemon chiffon clouds will take a great meal to fantastic!   I enjoyed Heirloom very much! The entrees were creative yet simple and the atmosphere is pleasant. I can't wait to get back for my Colorado lamb!   Bon Appetite!

I've given this place 3 trys. Bacon struck out 3 times. You know what they say...its 3 strikes and yoouuuurrree out!!!   Every time the kitchen is SUPER slow and every time, something was wrong with the order. One late Sunday, we (2 ppl) waited 45 minutes for our food. The restaurant was NOT even busy at this hour. I was starving!! Wait! On top of that, the servers suck!!! Two out of my three experiences included sucky service! They don't know the menu, they forget stuff, get the order wrong, neglect you....etc....  To make it worse, the food simply isn't all that great and definitely not creative. You know those places where the food is so damn good (IE Breakfast Club) that the long wait is worth it? Or an overwhelmed server is forgiven? Yeah! But not the case here. They really need to step up their game. Especially in this economy!   OMG! I almost forgot to mention their incredibly overpriced alcoholic beverages!!   The location is great. Has a ton of potential ONLY if they revamp the service and the food.

Like they say, you can put lipstick on a pig...but its still a pig. The food and the service are NOT what I expect from this beautifully decorated restaurant. I would have been better off at Caraba's.   I've been to Brio about 3 times now. The 3rd (and likely last) time was a recent Sunday for brunch. There were 7 adults and 4 children. Our server seemed disorganized from the time she took our order to the time we had to hunt her down thru a passing server to ASK for the check.    Our entrees came out in batches. Some at my table were eating 3-4 minutes before my food arrived. I expected all the food to come out at the same time...even if that meant our server had assistance. To top it off, my food was cold. My salad that I ordered for appetizer was over dressed and the lettuce wilted.   When a woman in my party asked for water, the server only brought ONE water. She didn't ask anyone else at the table if they'd like water also. When the server brought the single water, she made it a point to say "we don't automatically serve water". I know we have a water shortage in AZ, but damn! At least ask!   Only the kids and the 2 adults who ordered French Toast seemed pleased w/ their food. 2 of the kids probably don't count, as they are 1.5 years old! These growing boys were just happy to be eating!   Fantastic food can make bad service bearable. Outstanding service & presentation can make "OK" food great. But mediocre service AND food call for a 3 strikes and you're out in my eyes.

Ponied up at bar before it got too busy. No one at the bar but me and a couple others. Hakkasan restaurant is UBER sexy but I was a little put off by the snotty female bartenders. Even the lady sitting at the bar next to me noticed their dismissive behavior without my saying a word.   For starters, it took forever to be acknowledged. When she finally comes over, there was no smile. No friendly greeting. Just a plain face and a cocktail napkin put in front of me and a blank look. She eventually loosened up, but only after I made an effort to connect with her. Should be the other way around though. Just saying. The lady next to me with her BF asked the other bartender what was in a particular specialty cocktail she was making. Bartender looked at her and plainly said...vodka. Then walked away. Wow!!!  If I were giving out stars for service, I'd dole out a 2+. But the quality, creativity and showmanship of the cocktails made up for the bad behavior of a couple mean girls.    My first cocktail was a vodka made with quinoa. It was really smooth with a sweet, clean finish.  After dinner I ordered the Smoky Negroni cocktail (Ransom Old Tom barrel aged gin, Antica Formula vermouth, Campari and Grand Marnier smoke infusion). Tasted very similar to an Old Fashioned. Classic with a twist. Very good!   For food I ordered the Hakka braised pork belly clay pot. Very tender and full of garlic and gingery flavors. It's a little rich, so I'd recommend sharing this dish as an appetizer.   Like most LV restaurants of this caliber, be prepared for a $$$$ experience.   Enjoy!

Perhaps a bit on the pricey side, but sometimes you pay for atmosphere. This very sexy and trendy joint is located at City North (next to Blue Martini). I ordered the #1 sirloin burger with carmelized onions, gorgonzola, crescenza (soft, buttery cheese), arugula & thousand island dressing. OMG! It was massive and juicy and made me lose all dining diplomacy as the juices dripped down my arm! My friend built his own w/ hickory bbq sauce, cheddar and bacon.   On the side we had onion rings, sweet potatoe fries mixed w/ reg fries. Errrr....lemme make sure my gym membership is still active!! LOL  Personally, and I know this will cause a small uproar, I think the burgers are FAR better than Delux! I never understood the Delux cult following anyway. There...I said it! :)  I even endulged in the Guinnes milkshake (Guinness beer/vanilla bean & chocolate ice cream)! You know the saying don't knock it til you try it??This would be one of those times. When's the last time you had a sugar high and a buzz at the same time off a desert....hmmm??   Bon Appetite!

Been there for lunch a couple of times. The first time I was not impressed, and rather neutral about the experience. But I thought it was because I was on the phone w/ biz the entire time.   Went last week w/ a few folks from my office. Omg! We were thoroughly disappointed. Let's start w/ the chips and salsa. They serve a complementary salsa trio. Red, green and pico de gallo. The traditional salsa was borderline gross! No flavor and funky texture. The salsa verde was ok but not great. I asked for hot salsa....they didn't have one. Huh??!   The food was par at best and the service was worse! The restaurant was not busy and we had to search for our server for any and everything. We had to ask for our check and 15 min later, she still hadn't come to collect the bill. Tick Tock! Tick Tock! C'mon lady....I've got stuff to do!!! I had to take the credit card to her!!!   The icing on the cake was my asking for a to-go cup for my freshly poured iced tea. She brought me a soup container!! No thanks!   Meh! I'm cool on this place!

Really cozy little French bistro. I love to sit outside on the patio when its nice outside.   I've only been here twice and both times for Champagne brunch. The menu sometimes varies slightly reflecting what's in season and/or whatever fancies the Chef.  The Brunch du Champagne is 3 courses with endless Mimoas for only $35.   A must try!   Enjoy!

As usual, the collard greens were hit or miss. And this time was another "miss". Waaayyy too peppery!   Also as usual, the side dishes for one of the guests in my party didn't come out until after THREE requests for them...and probably 15 minutes after chicken & waffles came out.   The waffles were underdone.   Finally, as usual, the service was spotty.

Mozen Bistro allows the diner's palate to travel around Asia experiencing the flavors of Thailand, Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea and India. You can create your own bento box for bite-sized experiences. OR you can order slightly larger portions (like tapas) for a greater experience.   For those less willing to explore, the flip side of menu offers more traditional fare, like American and Italian food.   I loved that the chefs are Indian, Asian and other parts of the world. I believe it adds to the sexy atmosphere and authentic flavors.  Before or after dinner, you MUST also have a cocktail at the hotel's Mandarin bar. It'll put the olive in your martini so-to-speak!

I love this sexy, modern chic restaurant with the equally inviting menu. Everything from the textured walls, cool-looking servers and the interesting play on classic American food is wonderful!   The happy hour Mon-Fri from 3-6p is great! Unlike some happy hour menus where they serve the unpopular items in small HH portions, MS's HH menu is REAL food with REAL portions.   I have to confess that the ONE thing that I love more than anything else on the menu is.....drum roll please......the Sour Cherry Fix (Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a cocktail)! Its made with Vox Vodka, Lemon and house-made Sour Cherry Jam. The drink is mixed with crushed ice then the sour cherry jam is drizzled on top! OMG! Its like an ice-slushy for adults! Sour Cherry Fix on a hot Arizona day, and I'm in Heaven!   Enjoy!

When the weather is nice, I love the patio a Bar North. But it's Summer in Phoenix so that means A/C is a must.   Same great menu as North just more casual dining focused around the indoor bar and outdoor patio space.

One of my favorite spas in Vegas. The Four Seasons is situated at the top floors of the Mandalay Bay Hotel but does not share their spa/pool/fitness facilities. So you truly get the unique and classic Four Seasons experience. Outside pool attendants occasionally stop by to spray you with Evian atomizers on those (soo necessary on those 100 degree days). How 'bout a real fruit popsicle anyone? Each person/group is greeted with a complimentary pitcher of cucumber water (or whichever fruit you like).   The spa services are memorable and they're great about remembering you as a quest. You will be utterly spoiled!

I'm hooked! I've been over Sprinkles ever since I discovered that their cupcakes are basically a box mix.  Good box mix, but...still..  So for virtually the same price per cupcake, I have discovered the most moist and delicious cupcakes in the area! The favors are creative. The frosting is much better. And the cake is super fresh! Oh and no lines out the door.   They also have a wonderful selection of melt-in-your mouth Parisian Macarons too (Thurs - Saturday only).   Oh and then there's the cake. Cakes made to order at reasonable $$.   Enjoy!

I just adore this place! Haven't been to the DC Ranch location yet but shall soon! Its such a simple concept. The specials are always creative. The atmosphere is quaint. The service is always friendly. I esp love Marley. She always remembers me and is super-duper nice. If you're an iced-tea fan like me, they always have interesting ones like ginger green tea for instance. I love to experiment, but I am hooked on the turkey/apple/Swiss wrap like a fiend, and  find it hard to deviate. Although last visit, I tried the enchiladas....Yum-o! If your meal doesn't come w/ the sweet potato chips, I highly recommend getting them anyway! I promise you won't regret it. If you don't like, just call me and I'll take 'em! (Teeeheee)  The only remotely bad review I have here is about the soup. The soup specials are always creative, but beware! The chef has a heavy hand w/ the pepper! Always! I am a pepper-aholic...I mean I put pepper on every-frickin-thing....but lemme tell you...its  usually overwhelming!

If you passed Citizen by because of the "meh" exterior, then great! More for meeeeeeeeee! The drab atmosphere is easily forgotten once you've experienced an amazing meal from start to finish.   If you're waiting at the bar for a table, don't miss the opportunity to have the bacon popcorn with your cocktail. Yes! I said it. BACON POPCORN! With real bacon.   Be prepared for a wait Thursday-Saturday.   Enjoy!

The atmosphere is dark and sexy and the service was on par with my expectations. I ordered filet mignon w/ congnac sauce. My friend ordered bone-in rib eye. We shared the sauteed corn and a side of roasted brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious...I will definitely return again soon.

Windsor is like Postino and Vig had a baby!   Of course we had to start with the corn dog bites. I love these little nuggets of State Fair gold. There were a few pieces of friend pickle chips in the basket (on purpose).... Nice surprise!  The Russian Roulettes are a bowl of Japanese Shishito peppers that are charred and served warm. I like them with a little squeeze of lemon.   Deviled Egg Dip & homemade chips were better than I imagined. I have to figure out how to make this appetizer. I think it would be a big hit with friends.   After all the apps, we were full, so my friend and I ended up splitting the New Orleans baby back rib dinner. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and the flavor was smokey with a hint of sweet and heat. We had it with a side of cole slaw. I'm usually a such a lady at the dinner table, but I HAD to lick my fingers a couple times!!   For desert, don't forget to head next door to Churn for some of the best artesian ice cream in town!   Enjoy!

This place is super cool. Loved the tree stump stools, the unfinished tables with hardware and chalk menu board. The staff is very nice and the java is pretty darn good. I went for iced latte but I couldn't resist the the chocolate chip cookie with BACON! Yes...bacon! Why does bacon make everything taste better?!   Can't wait to check out their wine selection next!

If you've ever been to any of the Mastro's family of restaurants you know what I mean when I say Dominick's is like Ocean Club and City Hall had a baby. The original owners of Mastro's took the best of the local dining legacies, added some Italian dishes to the menu (yay!) and opened Dominicks.   Simply pulling up to valet and walking the red carpet leading into the restaurant is like food foreplay! It's all good lovin' from there!! It's all-star dining with 5 star prices but worth every dime.   Enjoy!

Avocado Chimis appetizer: I really love avocado so these were great. Full of flavor. The sauce reminded me of sweet & sour sauce for egg rolls.   Shrimp Pecan Salad: The menu describes it as mixed greens, raspberry vinaigrette, candied pecans, gorgonzola crumbles, green apples & Panko breaded shrimp.  What I got was a pile of BAG lettuce (bag taste and all) swimming in dressing. I asked my server, "where's the mixed greens"? He said he would check with the cook. The cook replied "its not made with mixed greens". I'm thinking....really??!! Really??!! Look at the menu again guy. "MIXED GREENS" in black and white. They made it over, with mixed greens, as it states on menu.   Green Chili Pork Street Tacos: I love love street tacos. The meat was dry yet smothered in cheese that I assume was Monterey Jack and I wondered where the lime wedge was. Meh! I probably shouldn't have expected much in the way of authenticity from an American food grill.  I probably should have ordered the Coronado Chicken sandwich like my friend did. At least that looked good!

Went for late lunch (1p) on a recent Monday. Not crowded at all...but it took 20 minutes for our spinach/artichoke APPETIZER! Waaaay too long! But the app was really good.   For lunch I ordered the Mushroom Club (Ham, turkey, Applewood smoked bacon, Provolone or Swiss, caramelized onions, grilled mushrooms, mayo, lettuce and Roma tomatoes, topped with sprouts). That's the way it's described on the menu.   WHAT I GOT was a lot of hoagie bread, raw, cold mushrooms on top as an afterthought and no sprouts! I was too occupied with my lunch meeting to bother saying something to our server. I didn't want them to remake it. Hell, it already took too long for the first one. I just wanted to eat it and get back to the office. Not only was the hoagie not served as described, it was dry and the tomatoes were watery. Not a great experience for my first experience.

I agree with all the other reviewers. I went expecting a quaint coffee and salad bar. I walked in feeling like I stepped into a dark cafeteria. I walked out feeling like I just left a strip club during lunch hour. More specifically, I left thinking WTF was that!??   Since the name is Barista Cafe', of course I expected to smell the wonderful aroma of coffee brewing or the sound of Cappuccino machine going. Nope and nope. Perhaps the smell of yummy food being prepared? Nope.   Visually, I was a little taken back by the dark purple walls and neon green & black accents throughout. I also immediately thought it was "interesting" that ALL the diners were men. So I walked up to the counter and 2 girls greeted me like cheerleaders on caffeine. They told me to take a seat if I was dining in and someone would be right with me. I sat down, picked up my paper, to-go like menu from the table and perused the selection. Everything sounded good. Nothing outstanding but pretty much what I expected. Sandwiches, salads, etc.   A young lady walked up and greeted me. I instantly felt some sorta weird way b/c she barely had on any clothes. The servers literally wear a sports bra with suuuper tight boy shorts. The ones most girls only wear lounging in the house or at the pool. I asked her to give me a second to decide on my order, so she did. As she walked away, her naked butt cheeks were bouncing along with her. Not exactly what I wanna see as I'm ordering a sandwich. So while she was gone,  I'm seriously contemplating leaving. I decided to stay to see if at least the food was good.   I ordered the Honey Do (turkey/swiss on spinach wrap). Comes w/ a side of Pop Chips. Like the other Yelper said, this place is nothing more than Subway with half-naked servers. The sandwich was just OK. NOT worth a frickin $9.89!!!!   I observed that when the servers interacted with male diners, they either sat down at the table or crouched down. I cannot lie, I've been to a Gentleman's club a time or two in my lifetime and no disrespect to the girls working at Barista, but I felt like they were recruited from bartending at the local strip club.   Bottom line, BC is NOT Hooters or Tilted Kilt. It's merely a lunch spot for men who want 18yr old eye candy at lunchtime. Hate to say this but mark my word, this place will be short lived for the following reasons: it's over-priced at Subway quality (Subway is good, but priced accordingly), the atmosphere is "cold", it's NOT a coffee bar, the service is mediocre and finally, most women won't frequent (so you've eliminated 50% of your potential audience).

I'm almost glad that I don't live in Las Vegas because I would "Eat" here every single weekend!! LV certainly has it's fair share of memorable restaurants in the hotels and on the strip, but Eat. is one of the best breakfast/brunch spots I've ever laid my palate on...period!   Thanks Chef Natalie for the awesome recommendations. The roast beef sandwich was simple yet complex...full of flavor and texture. My friend loves shrimp & grits more than life itself, and she raved about it the rest of the afternoon!   Next time I'm going to try those amazing pancakes that I hear so many good things about.   Enjoy!

Pastrami sandwich is super duper good!!! Tender, juicy, thinly sliced, very flavorful!   Also had the quinoa salad which was served warm but I felt would have been better served slightly cold. Otherwise, very tasty.

Lots of already great reviews, so I'll keep it simple.   My! I love what you've done with the place FP! Looks like it was once a drive-thru bank...thus the name "Federal" Pizza. Ceilings are partly exposed, partly textured. Awesome light fixtures. Interior is well done!   Burrata appetizer - Amazing...could have eaten the entire thing alone. MINE!! Don't forget to enjoy the basil "garnish" with the cheese. It really brings out the flavor.   Corn "coins"  appetizer - Meh! Next.   Cassanova Pizza - VERY good but the a typical ricotta, date and arugula pie.  Brussel Sprout Pizza - My favorite mostly because it was unique. Little bit of a lemony tang on the sprouts + salty from the pancetta. Also could have eaten alone! MINE! MINE!   Enjoy!

Although a chilly evening, patio dining was perfectly comfortable with electric heaters strategically placed in the ceiling above. Oversized scarves/wraps were available if necessary. Love that extra touch!   Appetizers:  Fried Green Tomatoes w/ Crab Remoulade and BBQ Rib Bites. The tomatoes were heirloom which I think stood up well to the cornmeal and frying. The flavors were great, but I think the portion size was a little on the skimpy side. Definitely wasn't large enough to share alone. The rib bites were served in a small cast iron skillet. These babies were fall-off-the-bone tender and very flavorful. I had to hold back to save room for dinner!   Dinner: I ordered the Chicken And Waffles w/ Bacon Brittle, Peach Bourbon Syrup, Cayenne Maple Butter.   Let me just say...I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur when it comes to chicken and waffles...and Chef Jesse got it right on the money!! If you prefer BONELESS fried chicken on a BELGIAN waffle...go elsewhere for the Gringo version. But if you want an AUTHENTIC Southern preparation and flavors with an updated twist, this is the place!  The chicken had a substantial, crispy batter and the meat was juicy and tender on the inside. It was served on top of a large, thin & tender waffle. But what made this dish extra special (can I underline extra special?) was the bacon brittle garnish and the cayenne maple butter. The cayenne butter replaced the hot sauce that I would have normally requested. It was buttery, spicy and perfectly balanced to the sweet bourbon syrup. And since I was going all out- I ordered the ham hock southern greens on the side. They were smokey, tender and very flavorful. I would have preferred a TAD bit of pot liquor though. "Pot liquor" is the seasoned liquid left after boiling greens. Otherwise, I was impressed Chef Jesse! Very impressed!   My colleague ordered the Blackened Salmon with Mixed Greens and Crispy Grit Croutons. In case you don't know what grits are, its just hominy. Sister to polenta. How cool of the Chef to make croutons out of it. Wow! I didn't try this dish personally, but let's just say he practically licked the plate.   Wine: Try the 2009 Iconoclast Cabernet. Great value by the bottle and incredibly smooth.   Desert: Spiked Root Beer Float. To my surprise, it was served with big nut-less brownie bites on top. Took me back to being a kid!   I thought the atmosphere was warm and inviting...buzzing even. It was family and group friendly. The server's uniforms were attractive and the service was very friendly.   Enjoy!

Glad I gave them a shot in spite of other reviews and a friend of mine who was under-impressed. If it weren't for the buy one/get one coupon, I probably would have delayed or avoided stoping in.   As soon as I walked in, a gal greeted me asked if it was my first time and I said "yes". She came over and gave me a quick tutorial of the menu and ordering process. Ok got it! Time to order...  I ordered a tuna and an Italian grinder. I must say off the rip, I was impressed by the variety of sandwich options, cheeses, condiments and toppings. Far more options than Subway, Potbelly and even Jimmy Johns (which I love). I also liked that the bread was good without being overwhelming (all bread-no filler like Subway).    My order was correct and didn't take very long (5-6 minutes) considering I ordered two custom sammies When folks say it took forever, I wonder if they're also calculating the time it took them to decide then check-mark the sandwich bag. If I add that time, then yes, it took me about 15m or so to order and leave.   I'd definitely go back and soon!   Enjoy!

Based on the mixed reviews by other Yelpers, I knew my experience would be a gamble. And sure enough, my experience at MM was eh, just ok.   All started well. My two friends and I were greeted and promptly seated in a booth. The decor is really modern and the booth was comfy. The perfect size for chatting with friends...if you can hear them!! The music is SO loud that we all noticed it. We had to yell to be heard. Some songs were louder than others and it became unbearable. Finally, we asked them to turn it down and they did. Whew!!   Now for the food. Ordered the salsa flight, guacamole, vegetarian tostadas, chicken skewers and steak skewers to share. I wondered if the tortilla chips were from the bottom of a bag. Half of the basket consisted of small, broken chips. No bueno!  The salsa trio was great. I particularly enjoyed the salsa verde. The guacamole was average. The chicken and steak skewers were really delicious and the sauces that accompanied them were very nice touches. Vegetarian tostadas were fantastic and very flavorful!   I ordered one wine and one Mexican beer. Can't go wrong there.   Service: our server was friendly but she wasn't consistent in asking us if we enjoyed our food or if we needed anything. Had to ask someone else to bring the bill and after 15 minutes of waiting for her to pick it up, I got up to walk it to the bar to cash out.   Verdict: their happy hour makes it worth going back but I won't expect much else.
