No thanks. Overpriced. No wonder why the place is empty on a Saturday night.... Paid $37 for 2 people to bowl 2 games. Ordered the chicken strips and it came out to be over $8 after tax for 4 strips and no side.

Best meal I've had in a long long time. I started with the wedge salad and had the Parmesan crusted steak with a side a broccoli. The steak was cooked perfectly and it melts in your mouth. We ended our meal with the raspberry cheesecake which was absolutely incredible. It has a kind of pretzel/graham cracker crust. So good!

As well as some of the other reviewers have said, I too was obsessed with the story of the Titanic when I was about 8 or 9 years old. We got our tickets from the vendors on the strip for $23 each (including tax). When you get to the Luxor, use the self parking in the back. Quick walk and convenient!  I decided to get the audio tour for the extra $5 but in my opinion was not really needed. They pretty much just say word for word what is written on the wall and I found it sometimes to be a distraction when I was checking out all the artifacts. The exhibit itself was an A+. If you are pressed for time you can see most of it in under 30 mins. I could have stayed there for hours to read all the different stories if we hadn't been pressed for time. I highly recommend going to see this exhibit as it was so fascinating. During the tour you walk on a replicated deck of the ship of what it would have seen and felt like on that tragic night. Bring a jacket because it's chilly.

Grrrrrrreat delivery service. Classy, youthful, blonde haired-blue eyed man delivers in a timely fashion. Order the chicken bruschetta pizza....BOMB.com

My dog Benny loves it here! He goes to the daycare 1-2 times a week and has stayed over night. He is always excited when we walk in the door!!

Best vape shop I've been to in the valley. I live up north and happened to be in the area with some vaping woes. The woman working at the time helped me out sooo much! She explained thoroughly the differences between juices and how to get the best use out of my mod and new chamber (which i previously thought was the issue). My "usual" vape shop never took the time to explain anything to me. I really, really appreciated her time and effort to make vaping a much better experience. This will now be my go to store! Thanks again :)

Awful customer service. When I tried to call the restaurant to let them know their driver dropped off the wrong order to me I was deliberately hung up on at least 5 times by a woman working there. I spent 45 minutes just trying to get a hold of someone who could fix this problem. Finally, 2 hours after the "promised delivery time" they answered their phone and the delivery came but there was food missing from my order...on top of everything I automatically added a $10 tip when i placed my order, what a waste. I won't be eating here again. Too bad because I was a frequent customer and really enjoyed the food...

Had a wonderful experience today at The Wine Store! The employees are extremely friendly and welcoming. They are eager to help you find what you are looking for, very knowledgable, and you can tell they love what they do. I will definitely be coming back and will recommend to friends.

On a July night my AC stopped working. I called a couple local 24 hour companies to get someone out right away and both wanted $120++ just to make the trip out and no one was available for at least 1-2 hours. I thought I was doomed until I saw Joe's great reviews here and on Facebook. I gave him a call and 20 minutes later he was at my house (on a Saturday night at 10:30! I). Less than an hour later my AC was back up and running!! :) He answered all my questions and his prices were fair. Not only did he fix the problem quickly, he also explained to me how I can better maintain my air system in the future. I will be recommending him to my AZ friends and family.

PGA Superstore is my favorite! So happy that they put in a store up north closer to where I live. This store has everything a golfer could dream of, and then some!
