This was my first time ever eating here and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Not a big fan of the olive garden type Italian eatery but Rigatonys is definitely no olive garden!! Food tasted fresh and like it actually was JUST made! I had the twice baked Rigatoni and nothing about it was boring or stale. I also like that we got to sample the house wine without feeling pressured to order. We were not rushed, and the server was very friendly. WILL come back to eat here again!

HOLY AMAZING BATMAN! My husband and I got married in Las Vegas and wanted something nice but affordable to eat for our dinner. Buffet style seemed to be the only way to go for 30+ picky eaters and chefs. We were a little put off by the size of the line when we arrived but what could we expect for not making reservations. Once we got towards the front of the line and they realized we were still decked out in wedding gear and we were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager and shots! They even took the time to open another cashier station so that our guest were able to pay for their own means instead of 1 large messy check.  We had no intentions of all sitting together since again we had no reservations and we were a large party, but somehow they worked their magic and had us all seated in 1 large area.  The food was outstanding. My husband is a chef, so pleasing him and 10 of his closest chef buddies is a hard task and yet everyone seemed to really enjoy all of the offerings. I did not quite make it to my favorite area (the dessert station) because I filled up on so much great food, but everyone that did eat dessert assured me that I missed out.  I will eat here every opportunity that I have, and still get calls from friends asking what restaurant we ate at for the next time they visit Vegas. Love LOVE LOVE The Wicked Spoon!

I work at an upscale resort in Scottsdale and ended up with dinning certificates my husband and I saved to have a nice date night without the kiddo. We wanted to go somewhere that we could truly enjoy the food, the atmosphere, and the beverages and found this highly recommended. First impression of the restaurant was great! Very clean looking, romantic setting if you wanted it, beautiful bar and everything just seemed in place and taken care of. The hostess was very friendly and quickly sat us in the area we requested. From there is where the service quickly took a turn for the worse.  Our server Amy came to greet us and took our water order? We had been sitting and waiting, reading the drink menu so by the time she came around we already knew what we wanted to drink but all she gave us the opportunity order was water. She returned a short moment later to take our drink order but still no water. We were brought our drinks by another server and halfway through our drinks our water finally came. Not a big deal but why make a fuss about our water order if its going to be brought to the table well after our drink order arrived.   My husband and I were pretty excited about trying the food so we already knew that we wanted to try the Pork Belly appetizers. Unfortunately  once our drinks arrived our server did not return for quite a while to give us the opportunity to order our starter. When she finally returned to the table the exchange was so fast we didn't have a chance to let her know we were also ready to order dinner. Once again she quickly disappeared and did not return until well after our food arrived. At that time we were finally able to order our main course.  Taking a look around the restaurant we started to notice that all servers (aside from ours) were very upbeat, enthusiastic, and just plain friendly. We waited so long for our drinks to be replenished at one point my husband had to go get us drinks from the bar! We counted tables and realized that our server not only had our table but 4 additional tables and a party of 15 or so. It was then clear that our table was picked as the sacrificial table to keep up great service to the rest. We get that sometimes you just get so busy this has to be done, but a simple " I'm sorry" really goes a long way. Why did this poor girl get no help or support from her team? A manager did not once come to our table to see how we were doing or apologize for the lack of service. The food was AMAZING. I am not really a pork eater but that starter is something I would eat over and over. I ordered the Filet and my husband ordered the Short Ribs. Both to die for!! My husband, being a chef, is very hard to please but there wasn't much that he didn't love.  If I was to rate this place just based on food it would hands down get 5 stars. Unfortunately its not fun to spend that much on great food and have such poor, poor service. Part of my job is to refer both guests and clients to restaurants in the Scottsdale area, and service like this makes me think twice about sending people that way.  I would return based on the food alone, but I would definitely sit at the bar. This first try was super disappointing.  Reservations are recommended, we were there on a Tuesday night for dinner and it was busy!

I recently had the opportunity to give this place a second try, and what a world of a difference! Had reservations with my husband for our wedding anniversary and from the beginning we had a change of heart about the place. From being handed black napkins so that we would not get lint on our clothing, to the bread service (neither of which happened on previous visits) everything was outstanding! Our server Gary was prompt, friendly, knowledgeable, and made us feel very welcome.  I again had the Filet, which of course was AMAZING. We tried the Mac N Cheese but it really wasn't all that impressive.  I really cant wait to eat there again, and bringing more of our foodie friends with us! Thank you CPH crew for making me see why this place gets 5 stars!

This place was fantastic! Our server Chris W. was very informative and recommended some pretty delicious picks. The pork belly sliders were so tasty I immediately regretted splitting the small portion and only having 1! My friend that joined me said the deviled eggs were the best she's ever had... and that comes from a deviled egg connoisseur. The place filled up fast for dinner and our service didn't suffer at all but I definitely recommend making a reservation...this place gets busy! Overall I would definitely dine here again and recommend it to anyone that's going to be in the downtown area.

Service was awful. All of the workers were obviously flustered and overwhelmed. No friendly smiles or good customer service. Waited over 45 minutes for food and it was cold. Asked for a manager and nobody came over. We decided to leave and left the food. Not even so much as an apology. Thanks for the orange juice I guess.
