I've lived and known about this place for 7 years and I finally went there. I had the steak potato and cheese. It was really good and really filling. The prices were really reasonable and the staff was friendly. I will for sure go back there!! Yumm!

I Frickin' LOVE this place!!!!!  Aside from most of the the Scottsdale bars this place is nothing like them, and that's a good thing!!! Everytime I go there I have a blast. The people there are a good mix Although yes there can be the occational group of doush bag guys and fake hair, fake boobie girls there too. But for the most part it's just really cool place for genuine people that aren't into the whole Snottsdale scene to go hang out.  The bartenders are great. Funny and Cocky just the way I like 'em!  And Hello......I almost forgot to mention!!! They have BIG beers there!!!! Oh yeah, and the Wheel O' Shot's, Kinda scary!!!   The only thing that kind of sucks about the place is that it's sooo small. The bathrooms are small, the patio outside is small, and they even have a guy that works there that's small.  But who cares because......they've got BIG BEERS!!!! WooHoo!!!

Poor Sugar Daddy's......... :(  This place used to be a cool place to go in south Scottsdale that wasn't THAT far for us that live in the east valley.  But ever since CBNC closed after that shooting, the crowd that went there to cause trouble and not just have a good time started going to Sugar Daddy's. And then Sugar Daddy's went from a cool bar to  Daddy's Ghetto House of Horrors!  Tax problems, and then stabbing, after stabbing, after stabbing. WTF!?!?!?!  You would think after the first stabbing they would have clean it up but it seems they haven't. Which sucks cuz the place can be really cool place to go and hang outside and party.  I guess if you ever want to go to Sugar Daddy's it better be during the day light hours and make sure you have on your full body armour.  Sugar Daddy's.........needs a Sugar Daddy, or a Voodoo Dr cuz there is some major bad MoJo going on at that place.

One of the better bars in the area. It's a real gem hidden amoung the big tree's. It reminds me of a place back home called Nye's.  So if you want to just go hang out with a great mix of people and drink, and hopefully not fall in the pond that's in the back, it's a great place. Summer is usually a better time to go to avoid the young college crowd. Those little guppies don't know how to handle their liquor yet! The staff there is great. Humorous and if your not a total doushe bag they'll mix you a mean drink. I wish I could go there more often because it's always a good time when I'm there.   OMG and I had this really good sandwich there once. It was killer!Mmmmm......sandwich.....uuggghhh!!!  I wanna go there now!!!! You wanna go there? Let's go!!!!

This Dog park is great!!!  The dog watching is fun and so is the people watching. But please people PICK UP YOUR DOG SH**!!!!  The only problem with this DP is the water or should I say.....lack there of?! It barely comes out as a trickle. Dogs are hot and thirsty and need water. If you spend the time and money to put dog drinking fountains into the DP they should work efficiently. Just sayin'! Although it is nice they switch from one side to the other so the grass can grow. I just wish they would turn the sprinklers off a little sooner Saturday night so the ground isn't so wet and muddy.  But over all it's a really nice park that I have gone to for years, even before it got all fancy!!!! :)

This is one of the best thrift stores around. It's really clean and organized. All the racks a SIZED and and sectioned into categories. I like that all the prices are consistent and everything is in pretty good condition. Nothing I have ever found was over priced. It is what it is.  My best find was a pink Betsy Johnson coat for $6.00!!!!  It's almost like shopping at a dept store it's so nice and tidy.  My only compliant is that the fitting rooms can be kind of stinky.

Usually we like Salty's but when we went there for a fun Saturday Cinco De Mayo party. Our day went from fun to totally grossed out!!!! They had these plastic yard glasses that they were selling for $5,so if you pay the extra $$$ and you get to keep the glass.  Well apparently they didn't order enough, and they were telling the bus boys they need to try and collect them if they could. Now I'm all about helping some one out in need. That is if they ask me nicely....BUT.......there was this little punk a$$ bus boy that wasn't even asking if we would give them up, he was trying to just take them off our table.  Rule #1 DON'T TOUCH MY BEER.  Rule #2 ASK ME NICELY IF YOU CAN TAKE MY STUFF FROM MY TABLE. Rule #3 DON'T MAKE RUDE COMMENTS ABOUT MY FRIENDS AND I WHEN WE SAY NO THANK YOU. See it's really not our problem you guys ran out. Call you beer vendor and ask him to bring you more. That's what you pay him for.  So after a while some of us decided to mingle and see what they had going on in the blocked off parking, with the band and stuff. And who should we see rifling thru THE GARBAGE but that same bus boy looking for those green PLASTIC yard glasses!!!!  I almost threw up my overpriced cheese quesadilia!! We could not believe it. We told the management what we saw, and hopefully it wasn't the same management that told him to do it. And they seemed less then interested. Instead of telling management I should have called the Board of Health. YUCK!!!! Think of it this way people, if they're pulling those plastic cups out of the trash to make more $$$$ what else are they pulling out of the trash to resale to make more $$$$. That is just Wrong and Nasty!!! Salty's you should really be ashamed of yourselves.
