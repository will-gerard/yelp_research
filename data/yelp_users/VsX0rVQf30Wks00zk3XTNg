If I could give Internet service 0 stars, I would. I have zero complaints about the customer reps attitudes, but it seems like nobody there knows a damn thing. It's just one big guessing game.   My Internet, which is "the highest tier", is so inconsistent. It goes in and out of service at least 3 times a week. I am the last person in the world to complain about anything, but for the love of god, i pay 70 dollars a month and get about 8 dollars worth. Anyway, I am gonna look for a new Internet provider. Cox, sorry to say this, but you guys are an"epic fail" when it comes to providing services that work.

Been coming here for 10 plus years. I can safely say the Half Moon is my go to local bar. I take a of my out of town friends and family here when they visit and no one has ever been disappointed. Keep on keepin on.
