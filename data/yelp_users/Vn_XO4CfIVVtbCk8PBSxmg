This location is a hot mess.  I love the Cheese Cake Factory but this locaton is not up to the standards that I accustomed to from this company.  Choose another location The waitress smelled like a pack of cigarettes.  So standing over me taking my order made my stomach turn.  Then my rice was undercooked.  When I told them it was undercooked they wanted to question me and say are you sure.  Im Asian I eat rice almost everyday.  There were Nat's flying around the food.  I won't be back to this location.

Great atmosphere great service.  I have had several of there dishes and I haven't had anything that I didn't like.  My favorite dish to order is the Thai Noodle salad with beef.  It's addicting you will be thinking about this salad days after you have eaten it.

Love this.place great mani and pedicure. ask for Nancy she is a perfectionist. I can't vouch for the other nail techs.  If Nancy is not available then I won't get my nails done.

Service was less than average.  The waitresses nails were realyl really long which I would have to question how clean they were.  My Ice tea was served with a  teaspoon in it.  So I was grossed out and decided not to eat.  Just sat there and let my other fruends enjoy there meals.  Yuck!!

I eat at the Waffle House  periodically.  But this location profiles clients.  When arriving to the waffle house we were given a regular menue.  Then I noticed all the ither customers were getting the all you can eat menu.   When I askes the waitress for the all you can eat menu she ignored me.  So I thought she didn't hear me and asked her again.  It was very obvious that she didn't want me to order off that menu.   They were only for certain customers.   So we left and I hear the waitress say she was rude.  Really!!!  If you haven't noticed we are in the 20th century.   Were that traylor trash hillbillies bull isn't excepted anymore. I won't be.back shame on you.

DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME!!!!!The only restaurant still open at the MGM after 10:00 PM. My sister and I ordered a salad and it was over whelmed with raw onion.  So all I could taste was onion.  So I told the waitress that the salad was over whelmed with onion and I couldn't eat it.  She had a attitude so I just decided not to reorder anything.  Then the manager came and try to fix the situation and offered me something else.  So I decided to get chicken noodle soup.  That's pretty basic it hard to mess up soup so I thought.  It was flavor less and there was veins threw out the chicken.   I was done at that point and grossed out.  You would think that a restaurant of that stature would make sure there food was Delicious.  The whole time we were eating the waitress was giving us attitude.  Big mistake,  I would have left you a great tip after all your not the cook idiot!

Service was horrible! !  Order 24 wings and didn't receive on drumlet.  My 7 year old sons burger was pink inside.  When I told the waitress it was raw she got smart.  Then the General Manager came by to apologize.  But he was disinterested in my complaint. So why even come over and waste my time.  Then I asked who the owner was and the same manager came back and said he was the owner.  I don't have time for all the games.

Orderd shrimp fried rice to go for dinmer.  Got home and all the shrimp was raw.  Called back next day because they were closed and the owner tried to say that wasn't the case.  Then wanted me to bring the rice back to get another one.  Yeah right I am gonna leave seafood out all night and smell my house up for a refund.  I frequently ate here.  But not anymore. This business wanted to act funny over $9.  Well u lost a customer who spent well over that in a year.  Whats even scarier than raw shrimp what if it was chicken.

I love this cute little studio.  It's located in old town Scottsdale  behind Martini Ranch.  I got a gel manicure with nail art and I love my nails.  It has been 2weeks and 6day's since my gel manicures and my nails still look great.  No peeling or chipping.  I usually get peeling and chipping after the first week and a half.  They have a huge collection of Gelish gel polish and ton's of nail art options.  I love the fact that they are american nail technicians that I can communicate with.  I will be trying a pedicure soon I will keep you posted.
