Competitive prices. But PK makes the difference. He's the owner and is extremely nice. Gives that small town feel to the place. Keeps a good staff. Plus they have a USPS station there which is wonderful to have during the Christmas season or if you have a lot of eBay shipments.

I've been bringing my Hondas here for about 12 yrs. maybe more. They are as honest as can be. They will never tell you need something you don't. If they think you could do it yourself cheaper, they will tell you and even get the part for you. Tait recommends things like if it was his own car he was working on. Free wifi and snacks if you're waiting as well. I'll never take a honda to anyone else and I've never recommended any company as much as hon-man. Too bad all businesses aren't run like this.

Horrible customer service. Highly overpriced. You can find the exact same items online for about 50% less. They claim to price match but anything you show them, they'll say is not a legitimate business and won't. They call Amazon "a huge garage sale". No refunds just exchange. I made the mistake of buying something from them before checking that out. No wonder they were in such a hurry to ring me up. I was at the chandler location but I'm sure they are all the same because the man I spoke to was very proud of the fact that he had 3 stores. Again, do your self a favor and not buy here.

Went through the drive thru to get kids some mc nuggets last night. Ordered 40. When I got home each kid said they were shorted. 2 boxes with 8 and 2 boxes with 7. Shorted 10 in total. I called and after they let the phone ring for about 3-5 min, a manager named Mario picked up. I explained the situation and he said I could pick up the 10 missing. I was too tired to go back last night so he told me to go back sometime today and he would leave a note. So I stop by as I'm running errands and they won't give me the nuggets because Mario only left a note saying something to the effect that he has taken care of it and that I should come back again when Mario is there. I told them that not only was I not returning ever but that I would be doing this and they seemed fine with it. They can't be trusted to get your order right. Whatever they're getting paid is already too much. Bring on the kiosks.

Oh goodness! So many options. Flavors and choices. Make pancakes, sprinkle on yogurt, put it in smoothies! And it's healthy too. What else can you ask for? I bet they have that too.

As if Iss' magic mixes wasn't good enough now we have a cafe too? So if for some reason you're too lazy to make your own oatmeal creations now you can have them made for you! Can't go wrong here. Something for everyone. Seriously!
