Unless you want thin, uneven, chipped lumpy gel nails....shoot yourself!! I wouldn't EVER go back. I demanded a refund and took my money right across the street for better quality work!! Plus the old asian lady told me to dont use acrylic nails cause men dont like fake, they like natural?? Lol uuhh what!! Ok whatever!! BAD SERVICE!

Well lets just start off with the BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE that I just experienced with the "manager/owner" of this place. Our office place orders from this place very often. I was heading back to the office and called this place to order a sandwich for delivery. A lady came on the phone (never talked to her for the last 2 years we've ordered) and she was just so unprofessional over the phone. Didnt want to take my order properly and just kept rushing me off the phone and demanding my credit card number. She failed to ask me what type of bread I wanted, she failed to ask me what I would want in my sandwich, OH and heres the kicker, she got mad at me WHEN I ASKED HER why she failed to ask me what size of sandwich i wanted? (6inch or 12 inch) SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  I called back, and I asked if we got disconnected or IF SHE HUNG UP ON A CUSTOMER, she happily said, "Yup I sure did hang up on you!!"   Well, our office is 2 mins away that I figured, maybe I'd come in and talk to a manager for the HORRIBLE EMPLOYEE that they hired!! I walk in and find out that this HORRIBLE EMPLOYEE is the owner and manager of this place! She ignored everything I said about being professional and HOW SHE IS SUPPOSE TO CONDUCT A BUSINESS and all her comments were "Are you gonna place an order or what?" I was beyond belief that this person conducts her business so poorly that she can careless about the professionalism of it all.  I advise our business office TO NEVER EVER ORDER from this company again!! I will be sure to aware others of the nonchalant careless RUDE customer service they conduct!!  PS Im sure this is the business owner STEVES (who is sweet and very polite) WIFE!!! She needs to just let her husband run the business and keep her RUDE A$$ at home! She just costed him a company of faithful Munchers!!!

You get EXACTLY what you pay for and less....  I booked a ticket on Allegiant, I wanted to add a bag on my itinerary to avoid the high expensive fees per baggage. Went online and clicked on "Manage My Travel" and they would not give me the option to add a bag on my return flight. I called customer service and spoke to an agent. 46 minutes later, I explain that I would like to add a bag for my flight that departs 2 days later. They rudely apologized, brushed me off, and told me to "just hope that the ticket agent understands what happen and waived the fee".  Well, of course, that didn't happen! Went to the ticket counter the day of and explained my fiasco to the ticket agent. She was rude and vague and told me that she is gonna have to charge me for a carry on bag! Um WHAT??  This company is just unorganized, unprofessional, and I would of probably got better service at greyhound.  How is this business still in business??

NAIL SHOP WANTS QUANTITY VS QUALITY  After the 3rd visit in a row of broken acrylic nail after broken acrylic nail. I decided that I should share my awful experience of these rushed nail techs that will give you less than what you expect so they can get you in and out so they can take more customers in! Forget about the smeared nail polish and the uneven acrylic, they just want to rush mine to get the customer who agreed to get a gel mani/pedi ($50) service vs my basic fill ($22). They were just unkind when I kept pointing out the things I wanted fix!! Just horrible service all around!!
