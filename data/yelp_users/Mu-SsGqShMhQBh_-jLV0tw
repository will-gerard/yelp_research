This isn't the right location, as mine up in Cave Creek was not listed. I have nothing but great things to say about this company. I brought my car in with a bad battery. They checked, it was under warranty. They replaced it on the spot, and there was no charge. They pulled it out and put the new one in, right in the parking lot. I strongly recommend this company.

Friendly and conveniently located. Love the Grilled Chicken Pita! Never a bad lunch.

I have taken my Shitzu Joey there for a long time to get a shampoo and cute, and have not been happy. I was too lazy to go anywhere else. Well now, I'm done with Petco. Their quality is terrible. Pricing is HIGH, and they turnover employees in the grooming all the time. I will spend some time here on Yelp to find a quality, reaonably priced groomer. Goodbye Petco for good!

I will never buy tires there again!  Every time I go in there they try to sell me 4 new tires! WTF! I just bought 4 tires at Christmas. Took them in to get rotated and the guy says "we'll take a look at them". I said, "I just want them rotated, they are 5 months old". He comes back and says they are not looking very good. Are you kidding me???  Never again will I go there, nor will I ever refer them. I'm done!

I took my dog in as he was not acting right. The staff was nice but the doctor got right down to money and what he thought I should do. The initial quote was $532, not including if surgery was needed. Then the doctor proceeded to upsell me if we did surgery (neuter, remove teeth and flap). I felt like I was in a car dealership get upsold right and left. Needless to say I got the xray, which showed nothing, then left. Will get a second opinion and most likely change veterinarians.

Healthy when you skip the rice (carbs). Feel bad they are not busier.

Go to their happy hour at least twice a week. Eat their $1 chicken burritos. And, of course chips and salsa. Brittany is usually our waiter and she's always very friendly.

Nice atmosphere and centrally located at Desert Ridge, which I am there nearly every day having a meeting at Starbucks. Great lettuce wraps during Happy Hour. Tons of big screen TV's with all the sports playing on them.

No offers after I checked in. Only negative thing I can say.  Love the fries and turkey burger! Our waiter Curtis was on it too!

I took my son there to get his tux. Right away the owner Kim came out and took care of us. I've never seen an owner of the business so hands on and caring. My son instantly was comfortable, and her suggestions were "spot on", as my son choice what she recommended. She also brought to our attention a coupon, and we saved $40. She didn't have to do that, but did. I will no doubt bring my son, and next year my daughter here for their prom stuff. I highly recommend this store to any bride looking for bridesmaid dresses, as well as all the wedding accessories you'd ever need, all in one store. Their location being right off the 101Hwy is ideal to get in and out.

Completely over-capacitated! I have NEVER seen a gym with so many people at all hours of the day. I have been a trainer for 30 years, and I joined this gym to do my workout. Every time I go in there, there are no available machines, and the free weight area is even worse.  They run group classed and take up 8 dumbbell benches, or 8 power racks at ONE TIME! Who is managing this gym???  For $170 a month I am done with them!  I will find a gym that I can get a workout in, where I don't have to accommodate their slow times (which are hardly ever).

I go there and work at least 4 times a week. Laptop friendly, but wish they had more outlets to plug into. Food is a little pricey for a sandwich, but that's okay. Right across from my fitness club, so very convenient.

Very poor service. Had a line of 7 people yesterday (I was one of them), and they ignored us for quite some time. One guy finally blew and made a scene. Today standing there  by myself. Nobody acknowledged me today, so I am not impressed.

Love this Starbucks for the business vibe! Lots of meetings going on. More than enough outlets for your laptop, but always crowded, so finding one is tough. Love the upscale feel.

The service has gone way down! I'm a long time customer and their treatment of customers like myself is not to be desired.

Nobody in here, and service is horrible! Waitress hasn't come around one time. Flies everywhere (and we're inside), no excuse. I had a pizza that was not good at all.

Front office (whoever answers the phone) are downright rude everytime. I will be switching doctors, as every call is unpleasant. Someone needs to give the front desk people some communication skills.  Just had a follow up and they wanted me to fill out all the forms AGAIN! I'm done with them! If you want a pleasant office experience, you are NOT going to get it at their practice.

Our heating went out in the coldest part of the winter, and our house got down to just at 60 degrees. I found Wise Mechanical and sent them an email as it was late at night. Joe, the owner emailed me back first thing in the morning. Kevin came out and spent over 30 minutes just looking at the wiring, as I watched. Did all the testing and thought it was the board.   Joe and Kevin came out to install the board and found it was just a switch on the side that had been turned off from the previous AC company that came out this last summer. They charged me for their time, and I happily paid.   I am thrilled I have found my heating and A/C company, and will refer them to my neighbors and friends. Joe stands behind his work, and is a very ethical family man with a son in the same school as my son.   I highly recommend Wise Mechanical for anyone looking to get their heating or air conditioning fixed!

Very happy with Dr Larson. She is very professional, friendly, and does not push you into more adjustments or a program like most chiropractors do. She spends as much time as she needs to with you. I've never felt like she rushed me through. Great location off of Cave Creek Rd and Tatum. Do your grocery shopping after your adjustment, as Fry's is right next door. I highly recommend Camrron, and will continue to go to her for a long time.

I will never have to look for another plumber again! Proskill Plumbing is who I'm going with from now on. Travis came out, and skillfully fixed my problem. He did not try to upsell me, nor pressure me. Just did the job I called for and was done! What an experience! It's a surprise to have a service company that treats their customers like that, but Proskill does, so I would recommend them to any of my friends, family and neighbors.

I called them up, and the owner Bob came out to look at my horribly cluttered and dirty garage. He made no judgements, and had great ideas. Gave me an affordable quote and we scheduled it. 4 days later he showed up, working in 108 degree heat. Great attitude, pleasant and did a fantastic job! For the first time in 13 years, we are now parking both of our auto's in our garage! Thank you Bob! I highly recommend this company, as they are honest, ethical and very professional.

Rob gave me a great quote and stuck to it, which unfortunately, many service businesses don't anymore. He did not attempt to upsell me, and instead left me 2 different products for when a stain or dog accident happens. And they weren't little bottles either.  I will have Rob come back and do the rest of my house for sure, and will let me home owners know about his great service.   I highly recommend Rob for a timely and excellent job, at a reasonable (very fair) price.

The owner is very knowledgable and his prices can't be beat! Gives great advice when you ask him. I'm confident I will not go anywhere else for all my supplement needs.

I called Andy yesterday (Saturday) to see if and when he could come over to install my new kitchen faucet. Well...he came the very next day at 11 o'clock. He quoted 2 hours and did it in just over an hour.  I also had him look at a door that leads to our backyard that was never staying shut and he fixed it in 2 minutes! Wow!  I have added him to my "favorites" in my phone, as I will for sure be calling him in the near future.   I highly recommend Andy for any work you have around your home.

Have been working out for over 35 years. This "gym" always has broken equipment that does not get repaired for over a week. The hand sanitizers in the gym are never filled up. Mirrors are filthy. From the day they opened which is what...well over a year or more, they still haven't gotten enough plates for the free weight area. If you don't mind walking across the gym to find a plate you need for your machine, then you'll be okay here. I'm not!
