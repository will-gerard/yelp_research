We usually come to Wag n wash for the delicious baked goodies, but today I decided to try their grooming services. My pup Milo got a groom from miss Raquel and he looks absolutely perfect!! She took the time to listen to my requests and followed every single one of them. This is the first time that I don't feel like I have to wait for his hair to grow out in order for it to look good. Love this store!

This is the first and last time that I bring my dogs to this place. I came in because it had wonderful reviews, but looking back they were probably talking about the grooming services. The self wash service is absolutely disgusting. There were hair balls all over the floor, wash tubs were dirty, there were puddles all over the floor, air compressors sitting in puddles of water. I guess I'm used to out usual self wash facility where we are given a bucket with clean brushes, combs, towels, bottles of shampoo and conditioner. Here it was more of a "towels are over there, shampoo is over there, and in this box you can find brushes and tools" and that would've been fine, except the towels smelled like dog urine, the tools and shampoo bottles were covered in dog hair. I washed one of my dogs and had to leave. I told the lady that I was leaving because the facilities were absolutely filthy, she just smiled and told me my total was $15. By impressed, I prefer to drive to 7ave to wag n wash and have a pleasant dog was experience in a clean facility.

We had never been to this restaurant before, but it was highly recommended by some of our Arab friends. Several people at our group bough a Groupon for this first experience. Service was mediocre, i expected much more for the price, the waitress took a very long time to come take our order (there were only three other tables in the entire restaurant.) I looked at an empty glass of water numerous time, and when we asked about dessert the waitress told us that we could get up and go look at the display! Food was delicious though, I'll give the kitchen staff that much.  When it came time too pay, the waitress took the first bill along with the groupon, charged it and then proceeds to tell the rest of our party that she can only accept one Groupon per table. So, not only did I pay for the Groupon, I also paid for the full price of the meal!  The food might've been delicious, but it is not worth the terrible service. Will never go back to this establishment an will not recommend it to anyone else.

This was the first (and probably the last) time that I brought my dog Milo in for grooming.  When I first walked in, the facilities looked clean although the smell was very unpleasant. The lady that greeted us in the front was very friendly, but I was very concerned that she did not ask for proof of vaccinations and she immediately put Milo in a room with a bunch of other dogs. Milo gets very upset and nervous around other dogs so this made me worry about his safety. When i was asked what kind of cut I wanted for Milo I specifically said a short puppy cut, with a round face, and trimmed tail. Not only did she rush through the process, but I felt that she didn't take the time to understand what I was asking for or to explain to me what she had in mind for my dog. When I picked up my puppy, I was infuriated with the way he looked. He was completely shaved off, bushy ears, very blunt clipper lines, and a half shaved half bushy tail. I told her that I was very VERY unhappy with the way he looked, she said that that's what the teddy bear cut looked like (as she quickly swiped my credit card). I guess I will be taking my business back to Petsmart, I feel that the staff there takes the time to analyze Milo, make recommendations on what type of haircut is better for him, and they use visual aids to help me decide on the length of his hair.

I was pleasantly surprised to receive a call from the owner yesterday in regards to my experience at The Dog Wash. I explained what had happened during Milo's grooming visit and she offered a blameless apology. I find it very comforting to find people that can apologize for a situation instead of passing the blame along to the next person, even when they were not at fault to begin with. She informed me that the person who groomed my dog on Saturday is no longer with the company and she asked if I would be willing to give The Dog Wash another chance. I was hesitant, but because of her sincere and helpful customer service I decided to give it one more shot.  I won't give it a 5 star rating just yet, I still have to say what Milo's hair will look like, but it is a step in the right direction.

I returned to The Dog Wash for a second chance and I am beyond pleased!! I am terrible TERRIBLE with names so I am sorry that I can't tell you exactly who greeted me when I first walked in the door, but she was very friendly. She called over the lady that would be grooming my Milo (Again, sorry I'm terrible with names) she took her time listening to me. I asked her to shave Milo but to leave his face round, I have severe allergies and needed to keep his hair extremely short to avoid dirt and grass getting stuck in it.  She explained very carefully that it would not be a "cute" cut and I was ok with it. Well, few hour later I came back to pick up my puppy and let me tell you, I don't know what she meant by not cute. His hair cut is perfect!! It is short, cute, there are no blunt lines throughout his cut, he smells fantastic, and he looks absolutely cute.  The best part in all of this is that Milo didn't run to me when I came to pick him up, which means that he was happy and had a great time while at The Dog Wash.  I will definitely be returning and I recommend The Dog Wash it to anyone who is looking for excellent customer service, grooming and care of they loving four legged babies.    Ps- I took a peak at their Self Wash stations and they are fantastic!!!

Food is fantastic, but the young staff really needs to step up their customer service skills. There were 4 people behind the check out counter, I was the only one in line and it took over five minutes of me standing there for someone to ring me up for my order. I would've understood of they were busy, but they were talking amongst themselves, greeting friends that were coming in for dinner and walking them to their tables. A waitress who had nothing to do with my check out was the only person that greeted me, asked how my day was and if I had been helped. There is room for improvement guys.

My husband decided that it was time to upgrade our kitchen and embarked on this journey to change our non working/dated/awful light fixture and get recessed lighting. We contacted Troy and he was wonderful from the beginning. He was clear and upfront about the costs and the time that it would take to instal our lights. He arrived on time and wasted no time getting to work. Although he had estimated about 5-6 hours to finish the job, he was done in 4.  He installed 4 recessed lights and two island pendant lights. Our kitchen looks absolutely wonderful. We recommend Troy 100% for any lighting updates, his work speaks for itself. Troy is also accompanied by a young apprentice which was just the cherry on top. It is wonderful to see professionals sharing their knowledge with the younger generation and teaching them about hard and honest work.
