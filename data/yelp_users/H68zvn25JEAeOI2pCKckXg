On a whim while missing home, I did a Yelp search for Texas Kolaches and Rainbow Donuts is what I got.  It's not close to my house, being in Phoenix, but luckily, it is close to my new job.  I don't make it up here nearly often enough, but when I do, it's always worth it!   Not only are they the only place in Phoenix with Texas Kolaches (that sign isn't lying...I can't find them anywhere else), they also have a huge selection of donuts!   My personal favorites are the spicy sausage kolache and chocolate frosted buttermilk donuts.  I've tried the bacon maple donut, and it was good, but it really needed more bacon (is there such a thing as ever enough bacon?).  Other winners are of course, the sprinkle donut, the cake donuts, and some kind of chocolate cake donut with a honey glaze.  Really, I don't think I've ever had a bad donut here.   The woman behind the counter is always friendly and patient with me as I take forever deciding what I want (I always go in for 1 or 2 and come out with 6 or 7).   There are a few Rainbow Donuts sprinkled around town, but they're all independently owned.  I've never tried the others, so just to be safe, you better just come to this one.  :)

I will start this review by mentioning I have not actually been to the location, but that I received samples of cakes from this bakery from a catering company at a tasting.  So, I have no information on the shop or the service, only the taste.   And let me tell you, it is definitely NOT worth making the trip to the bakery.  I received four samples, White Chocolate, Strawberry Rum, Raspberry, and Chocolate.  The cake was light and fluffy, but honestly resembled the kind of cake layers that you get from a grocery store.  You know, unnaturally light and fluffy.  (If you've ever made a cake from scratch, they are more dense than that from a box.)  There is no way this cake was made with fresh ingredients.  But, this doesn't matter to everyone, and the taste of the actual cake was not that bad.  Also, there are some decent boxed cake brands out there.  As for fillings, there seemed to be a layer of pudding, (vanilla and chocolate, depending on which cake you try) and it, too tasted like it came out of a box or a can.  My guess would be from a large tin can, which certainly has it's place on a Chinese food buffet, but not on a supposed gourmet cake.  In addition to the pudding, there was the flavor of choice for the cake.  One was a layer of strawberry jam, which said it was strawberry rum, but I couldn't taste the rum at all.  The raspberry was also a jam and pudding combination.  The chocolate was the least offensive of the cakes (a majority vote by the two friends I had with me) and the worst was the white chocolate, which my friend's 6 year old son tasted and then made the most hilarious face before asking if he had to eat anymore.  (And we're not talking about a picky kid here.  He routinely eats burritos from Chipotle with spicy barbacoa and guacamole, which is not something you'll see a picky eater do.)  To top it all off, no pun intended, the frosting was a non-dairy whipped cream.  Are you kidding me?  Spring the extra $1/gallon for the real stuff!  You've clearly skimped on the rest of your ingredients, so how about you go nuts on this part.    In case there was any doubt left in your mind, no, I did not decide to order cake from Fleur De Lis.  If I wanted a grocery store cake, I'd go to a grocery store and probably pay a hell of a lot less.  Sadly, they have quite a few pictures on their site, which means lots of suckers have shopped here.  It is "unforgettable" for sure.  I will definitely remember not to recommend it to anyone.  Save your money and just get your wedding cake at Costco, or go to a better bakery if you're looking for gourmet.

There's a decent amout of Hawaiian food options to choose from in the valley, but Moki's is my personal favorite.  They used to have a second location, but it closed, which sucks because it was right by my house, bigger, and more decorative.  This location is still good, but doesn't have the same atmosphere.  Luckily, the food is just the same and still really good.   I am a creature of habit, and therefore have only ever tried the chicken katsu, brown rice and Hawaiian salad, but there's a reason I never try anything new here.  They taste really good!  And, the thing that gets me to drive all the way to this Moki's instead of going to Aloha Kitchen, which is basically down the street from my house, is that they use white meat for their katsu, which is not the case at AK or Ono's.  I am not a dark meat fan, so this is a big deal to me.   The food takes a little bit to come out, but that's because it seems to be made to order, so I don't mind a few extra minutes.  If you're in the mood for dessert, the grandma's chocolate cake is really rich and delicious.  And, if you are looking for some fun Hawaiian culture, go in on one of the Friday nights that they have a luau.

This pizza place is close by to where I work and we've run into the owner from time to time shopping at Restaurant Depot, so it was only natural we were bound to try it out eventually.  This place is definitely a step above Pizza Hut and Domino's so stop ordering at those places right now and support a local business!   My favorite is the pepperoni with jalapenos and a side of cheesy bread.  Definitely get the cheesy bread.  They serve it with a side of melted butter and I swear you'll never reach for marinara sauce again.  The wings are also awesome and I'm not even a wing fan.  I've been dying to have the boyfriend check it out as he's a wing connoisseur and I know he's going to love these.   I live close by, but I'm moving soon and need to get food to feed my hungry helpers, so we'll definitely be ordering up a huge spread for every to fill up on.  Too bad that after they eat no one will feel like lifting anything heavy.

After a quick dinner at the cheese-steak place on Mill Ave, we had some time left on the meter so we stopped into Fascinations for a quick look around.   What really got me in the door was the adorable 50's pin up dresses in the window.  I love the look, but the style is usually expensive.  I was shocked to see that the prices on their clothes were actually affordable!  We took a long look around the lingerie section and they've got a great selection.  I was excited to see that they sell poles and the cashier and I got into a fun conversation about where to take pole dancing classes (Express MiE if you're wondering) and how much fun it is.  The girls working there were super friendly and incredibly knowledgeable about the products.  We wandered into the back with the toys and the girl helping us knew about every product on her shelves.  Shelve your insecurities and preconceived notions  This is a fun place for couples, or even just to come check out with your girlfriends.  Chances are you'll leave with something you'll love!  FYI, parking on Mill sucks.  Expect to pay a meter.  There are lots of Fascinations shops around the valley, so if you're not into paying for parking, you've got options.

For all the talk I've heard about this place, I expected something amazing.  Perhaps it was oversold.   The boyfriend and I found ourselves with a free lunch hour driving around Tempe when it hit me that we should try out a place that's been talked up to me for ages.  So, we headed right over. First of all, parking is non-existent.  We drove around the block and still never could find anything that indicated we were allowed to park there without risk of being towed.  We finally settled on parking on the street out front, but had it been anything other than 11 am, there probably wouldn't have been a spot.   We were greeted and seated immediately, and service was fine.  It's a rather cavernous room with an old warehouse feel to it.  I'm fine with that.  It doesn't seem to be air conditioned, though, and we were relying on heavy duty fans that kept blowing away the napkins to keep us cool on a hot AZ July day.  Probably not the best choice for summer.   The menu options looked so good when I checked out the website on the way over, but both of the sandwiches we ordered were less than spectacular.   We ordered the Tap Room Tenderloin and the Salmon BLT and split them.  The combination of bleu cheese, onion straws and garlic-jalapeno aioli sure sounded like it'd be bursting with flavor, but it was undeniably bland.  Neither one of us could even taste the tang of the bleu cheese and there was not even a little kick from the aioli.  The blt was just as sorry.  Where the tenderloin was lacking in flavor, the salmon made up for it and then some.  Someone was a bit heavy-handed with the cajun seasoning and the salmon just came off overly salty.  I don't remember tasting any pesto in the mayo.   As we were there so early in the day, we did not have a drink, but it might be better to go back with our bellies already full and give them a shot.

If you're looking for a fun new experience, or you're just not into climbing outdoors, this is a good way to get out of the house and do something different. I've been to this gym a few times over the years, but never often enough to get out of having to watch the safety video and go through the climbing training.  This last part is probably a good thing, just so I don't drop my boyfriend as I'm letting him down.   There's not much to say, one climbing gym is generally like the other.  This one has a bouldering area, which when we went was under construction and a pretty cool crevice that you can climb inside.   It can get a bit crowded with "real" climbers (the ones that can actually follow the color path and make it all the way to the top) but you can still generally find room to climb.   The employees are always willing to help if you forgot how to do something or need assistance.  Don't be afraid to ask.   If you aren't in a rush to go, wait for a deal to come up on Groupon or Living Social, because they do often and it's generally half price.

I haven't been in Rubio's in a while, and I was driving around starving and decided to settle on some chicken flautas.  I stumbled on a Rubio's that happens to be down the street from my house.   After a quick glance at the menu, I realized they have completely changed their menu!  After a second glance, I realized this was not a bad thing at all.  They had some really incredible choices and being that I was so hungry, this made my decision incredibly difficult.  I finally decided on a two taco plate with one portobello and poblano taco and one avocado and corn fish taco.  And let me say, I couldn't decide which was better!  The fish was crispy and not at all greasy and the porotbellos had amazing flavor.  After my first bite, I immediately began to wish I had bought more food, even though I ended up full after the meal.   There were so many other delicious looking options (including a summer orange shrimp salad that I can't wait to go back for) and the best part was that without even trying, I managed to end up picking a fish taco made with sustainably farmed fish.  Bonus because I love companies that are making an earth-friendly effort.   The staff was very friendly and my food was ready so quickly (but didn't taste like it had been made earlier and sitting around).  Best of all, the salsa bar, which makes me worry, since I never know what other customers might have done to it, was very clean and fully stocked.  Nothing had migrated from one spot to the other (like when you find peppers floating in the salsa because a customer has dropped them in there) and everything looked fresh.   All in all, definitely check out Rubio's new menu because it may be your new go-to spot for quick, fresh, Mexican food!

You don't expect Delux when you pull into the Safeway parking lot.  At night there's a phosphorescent blue glow drawing you in like a moth to the flame.   There is an outdoor seating area, which is actually pretty relaxing for being in a grocery store shopping center.  This time around we opted to sit inside, and to my delight were seated at the long lighted table in the center of the room!  I love this table because it always makes me feel like I've entered a much trendier, fashionable city than Phoenix.  The fact that they're also open until 2 am helps, too. There's not a lot I can say about Delux that hasn't already been said.  The atmosphere is enticing and the food is always excellent.  They serve Niman's Ranch beef, which always makes me happy, and the price is reasonable for the higher quality meat.  There's a great beer menu, if you're into that sort of thing, and a sizable list of other cocktails if you're not.   If you find yourself drifting towards a drive thru because it's getting late and you're craving a burger, reconsider and head towards Delux for a damn good burger and a drink.

What can I say that hasn't already been said?   They weren't lying when they named it a hideaway.  I never would have known about it had an old roommate not taken me for lunch one day.  And now, it's my boyfriend's and my go-to spot.  My favorite is the chile rellenos (duck and pork with green sauce), although my boyfriend gets something different every time and is never disappointed.  The chiles are always spicy which I LOVE because nothing is ever spicy to me and this is one of the few places that has been able to make me reach for a glass of water.   It's a cozy place that almost reminds me of the inside of a hunting cabin that's been decorated up for fine dining.  They have a decent selection of wines and other bar items.  As far as seating goes, expect to wait for a bit unless you get lucky because it's a tiny "dining room".   All I can say is, "Go eat there!"  It's really amazing food and a really unique atmosphere.  Definitely worth the hunt.

I've driven by here countless time, and not being much of a coffee drinker myself, I've never stopped. Went in with my fiance today and even a coffee novice like me can taste the difference! The coffee served here is clearly a step (or several) above Starbucks! And the barista was so fast! Almost seemed like he must have been a bartender at some point in his life. He was so efficient and put on a bit of a show as he made our drinks. His service was excellent and paired with the great tasting coffee, we'll definitely be back in.

This place is  my favorite thing about going to the ribbon store! Best hot dogs with all the works for a perfect Chicago dog! The fries are always fresh and hot. Don't let the tiny little shack appearance fool you. This place is absolutely worth stopping for!  And the best part? It's a good price. $6.25 for my "works" Vienna beef hot dog, fries, and medium drink. I'll take that over Mickey D's any day.  Keep up the good work, guys. I already can't wait to come back.

Any time the boyfriend and I can't think of what we want to eat, we can usually agree on Smashburger.  This location is close to our apartment and hasn't failed us yet.  The burgers and fries are awesome, but honestly, we usually tend to lean towards the chicken sandwiches.  The grilled chicken is good, but being a southern girl, I can't resist the fried filet.  And the fried pickles!  If you've never tried these gems, you need to!  They're cheap (only $2.95 if memory serves) and they are amazing, especially with ranch to dip.   The staff is always friendly and the food always comes out quick and hot.  I've seen a lot of complaints about people waiting a long time for food, but in all the times we've gone, this has never been an issue.  Perhaps people don't understand that when there's a line to the door, you aren't the only person they're cooking for.   Anyway, if you're in the mood for a good, cheap burger, skip Burger King and hit up Smashburger.

During our monthly mani-pedis at Nail EnV (the best, by the way), my aunt and I were discussing where we should go for dinner.  As we frequent this nail shop quite often, the manicurists tend to chime in on our conversations, something we don't mind because we've gotten to know them quite well over time.  We were discussing Thai food and searching Yelp for a place that seemed worth trying when one of the guys says, "Why don't you go where Karen's husband works?"  Apparently, Karen, one of our manicurists' husband works as a cook at Thai Chili.  Sounds good to us, so we finished up with lovely nails and headed out. All the reviews said beware of the spice factor, so we were careful when we ordered our soup.  Turns out, we needn't be cautious.  I like spicy and a 5 was spicy, but still tolerable.  I probably could have gone higher, but I wanted to make sure I'd still taste my food.   Not being all that familiar with Thai food, outside of Pad Thai, I wasn't sure what to order.  Lucky for me, my aunt knows her way around the menu.  She got something in a green curry that had coconut milk and I don't know what else, but it was really good.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I tasted hers, but I was in.  I ordered something that I can't remember the name of, but it was pork in peanut sauce with vegetables.  It was wonderful and I can't wait to try this place again!   I wish we had room to try some of the desserts, but we were well on our way to stuffed when we left.  I can't wait to take my boyfriend in for a taste of this place!

My boyfriend and I stopped in on the way to see a movie (he had already inhaled a DQ ice cream, but I'm lactose intolerant, so I was still hunting for something sweet as we walked around the outdoor mall).  Cupcakes aren't exactly my top choice, but as I am a cake decorator, I do enjoy trying out other baker's wares.   We ordered a smores cupcake to split because these things are massive!  For $3.75, it's really not a bad price, especially since Sprinkles costs about the same and the cupcake is half the size.  The cake was very chocolaty and moist, so score one for Caketini, however, I was honestly disappointed at the missing ingredient in my smores cupcake.  They baked a graham cracker crust onto the bottom of the chocolate cupcake, so we've got the grahams and the chocolate, but where were the marshmallows?  Oh, wait, there were 3 or 4 miniature ones on top of the cupcake.  Um...in case no one here has had a smore in a while, the marshmallow is a major component and needs to be given ample representation!  With a cupcake this big, you have a perfect opportunity to fill it with homemade marshmallow filling, or Fluff if you just don't want to waste time making it yourself.  The end result was basically a chocolate cupcake with graham cracker crumbs in it.  It actually made it hard to get through the whole cupcake because both my boyfriend and I lost interested before we had finished it.   Hopefully someone that works there reads this and realizes they are missing a great opportunity to fix a boring cupcake.   I might be back to try another flavor, but honestly, I wouldn't make a special trip.

Being from Texas, I am skeptical about all things barbecue and chicken fried outside of home.  Most places, hard as they try, will never get it right.  That being said, Texas BBQ House was like stepping into a teleporter that brought me right back to the doorstep of home.   Served up in a traditional Texas style, you walk up to the counter and order various meats by the pound.  They are sliced right in front of you, placed on butcher paper and set in a plastic crate.  You grab cold sides from a reach in fridge and order hot sides from one of the nice men at the counter.  They've got sweet tea, the good Coke (the Mexican kind in the bottle that still has real sugar), and IBC in a bottle.  Doesn't get much better than that.  Every single meat (and I do believe we tried them all) was moist and just seemed to fall apart as you picked it up.  A quality Famous Dave's has yet to master with their brisket.  The boyfriend and I decided to try order as much as we could, stuff ourselves, and go home with leftovers.  As we ordered, the staff would cut us both samples of each meat.  We were not disappointed in a single one.   After loading up on brisket, jalapeno sausage, pork loin, and ribs, they brought us samples of the creamed corn and pinto beans.  Both were excellent, but we just went with creamed corn (like we didn't already have enough food).  And what kind of barbecue dinner is complete without potato salad and coleslaw?  So, we threw both of those on as well. In true Texas tradition, they hand you as many slices of white sandwich bread as you'd like, you pay, and you're on your way to carnivore heaven.   Like I said, everything we had was delicious and I guarantee this little gem would not be shunned back home.  There are LCD televisions in every corner and they'll put on whatever game you'd like to watch.  It's chilly now, but during the nicer months you can enjoy your feast outside on picnic benches under a covered patio.  It's in the middle of nowhere, (24th street and Broadway) we nearly missed it, but they are opening a second location in Scottsdale sometime in January 2012.  I think I'll still head out to this one, though, as I can't really see myself eating barbecue around the Scottsdale crowd.  They close early (7 pm) so don't waste daytime.   Next time I'm in, we'll try not to overload ourselves and leave room for dessert.  I'm eager to try the banana pudding and the boyfriend loves pecan pie. So, I'll update on that as soon as we get hungry again.

On a random day off, I went in search of a pedicure.  It was pretty late in the day, but I thought there might still be a chance something was open.  I pulled up to Nail enV and the sign said "open", but the hours said they were closed.  The door was open, so I poked my head in and was told they didn't mind doing a pedicure for me.  I thought this was exceptionally kind, especially because I know I can't stand it when people walk in at the last  minute when I'm getting ready to go home.   I picked out a color (I'll go ahead and agree with the previous reviewer that their color choices were limited, but since they're fairly new, I expect that may change over time.) and got a very relaxing spa pedicure with hot stones.  The guy that was helping me (I wish I could remember his name!) was excellent, and he didn't rush at all, even though it was getting late.   I really appreciated that they took all the tools out of sterile packaging and everything looked very clean.  Definitely a plus!  Also, they had tons of artistic designs for nails, that even though they aren't really my style, I might try next time. All in all, it was reasonably priced and they went above and beyond by taking me as a customer when they could have easily told me to come back during regular business hours.  I will definitely be back when it's time for my next pedi!

My aunt and I have been coming here for several years, but we don't get it as often as we'd like. But that doesn't stop the staff from remembering us. Even if it's been 6 months, they still welcome us by name and make it a point to ask how we've been!  Neither of us lives close to this salon; we're both at least 15 miles away. But they do the best gel manicures and they last longer than any other salon either of us has tried. Plus, everyone is just so nice! Karen knew I'm going through cancer and that it's more uncomfortable for me to sit in the bar chairs, so she made sure I was comfortable in the massage chair and did my nails from there. And Mimi and Shawn and all of the girls asked how I'm doing as we get through treatment. One of the girl's has even come to me for desserts (I'm a local cake decorator). Just genuinely nice people, which really keeps us coming back.  As always, we left with beautiful work and lots of smiles. Can't wait to go back for the next design!

I'm from Texas.  I'm not Arizona's biggest fan and I hope not to remain here for the rest of my life.  Every time I think I'm getting out of here, something happens and I get stuck.  Eventually, I'll escape this hell and make it back home.   I miss everything about Texas.  The friendly people, the trees, grass in front yard, tubing on a river that actually moves, breakfast tacos, and barbeque.  Thank God, two of those things are here now! I had stumbled onto Texas BBQ House and I admit, I loved it, but it's in a sketchy part of town that I'd rather not go to.  (And there's something wrong about eating barbeque out of crates in Scottsdale.)  At one point, my boyfriend and I actually contemplated making the 6 hour drive to El Paso to get some Rudy's.  Luckily, the next weekend a friend told us they were building a Rudy's!  Close to our house!  Down the street from where I was currently working!   I think it was maybe 2 days after it opened before we finally made it down there and it was EXACTLY like walking into Rudy's that's 10 minutes away from my parent's house.  There's country music playing and Blue Bell ice cream and tubs full of every kind of Shiner you could ask for.  It felt like home.  Every time I go, I'm simultaneously elated to feel like I'm back in Texas and depressed to know I'm not.   Everything on the menu is amazing.  I'm a big fan of lean brisket and jalapeno sausage, but seriously, there's nothing on that menu I won't eat.  I always get one of the big tubs of potato salad and that chocolate pudding will change your life.  And, if you go in the morning, there's breakfast tacos!  This is the only place in Arizona that seems to know what a breakfast taco is and serves them!  It's a travesty that we live in a state with flour tortillas, but they refuse to make breakfast tacos or even figure out what they are!   As for the reviewer complaining about the crates and deli paper and *gasp* having to refill their own drink!  This is Rudy's Texas style barbeque.  We're friendly folk and we don't mind sharing a table with strangers.  Texans will just strike up a conversation with the people next to them, or in line with them, or hell, a phone call placed to the wrong number.  If you don't like it, go next door to the unlucky folk who happened to open a barbeque place next door to this gem.   And how can a place that's been open 24 years and opens a new location that looks exactly the same as all of their others be copying a place that opened maybe a year ago?  I do believe Texas BBQ House is copying Rudy's, not the other way around.  Get it right.   Bottom line, if you haven't tried Texas style barbeque, you need to go here.  Forget all the lame reviews from people that don't know better.  Just come and have the best meat of your life.

On the way to The Farmhouse in Gilbert a couple of weeks ago, we stumbled onto Biscuits.  Being from the South, I'm always down for biscuits and gravy, so we decided to check out this cute, barn-themed restaurant.  It was a little to shiny to actually exist on a farm, but welcoming, none the less.   The restaurant is very clean and open and the service was friendly.  We were sat immediately and received drink orders before we could decide on anything from the delicious looking menu.  There were definitely some good ol' southern favorites, like grits and corned beef hash, but there were also a few chorizo options and a Portuguese sausage that my boyfriend ordered.   I went for the corned beef hash, scrambled eggs, hash browns and added sausage gravy to my biscuit. Make sure you go hungry!  I couldn't even dream of finishing everything I ordered, but I made sure to it all.  Crispy hash browns, fluffy eggs, and big chunks of corned beef mixed with potatoes, peppers and onions.  The sausage gravy was perfectly thick, but could possibly have used a bit more sausage (what can I say, I'm a meat lover!).  The only thing that brings it down to 4 stars was the biscuit.  It was definitely good, but more bready than flaky.  More like a stirred mix than an kneaded dough with the goodness of flaky layers.  And, being their namesake, I do think that part is pretty important.   We were plenty stuffed and we'll definitely go back because there aren't many places with corned beef hash that didn't come out of a can.  Also, they have good service, which is hard to come by.  On another note, they offer a military discount to any active or inactive duty military, which is wonderful to see because it's just something small that companies can do to give thanks to people who willingly put their lives on the line every day.  I can support that.
