I had no idea who Frank Lloyd Wright was until we drove past this place and my BF started freaking out. He had just spent 3 days shopping with me so I couldn't deny him the chance to go visit.   The tours weren't expensive since they were so long (I think 90 minutes?) but there was no option for a shorter, cheaper tour so we ended up passing.   I ended up falling in love with a lot of his art and almost went home with the overpriced coloring book until I realized I would rather use the $10 to get another pair of shoes.

I came home with:  2 pairs of Steve Madden wedges $15 each  Steve Madden boots $10 (1/2 off all boots when i was there)  Dolce Vita wedges $15 Rainbows $10 3 Longchamp purses around $30 each  Tory Burch sandles $40 Michael kors watch $40  James Perse blouse $6  Burberry pajama bottoms $10   and my favorite finds were:  2 pairs of classic Jimmy Choos $100 each  1 pair of bow Valentinos!!!!! $100   I had a lot of fun and want to try and go once a year. I went at opening everyday but I don't think that really got me anything that I wouldn't have gotten otherwise. I was hoping for a pair of toms but those were snatched up really quickly. I almost saw a fight break out over a pair of Revas. I went with pretty low expectations and left very, very happy.

BF and I walked into the store looking confused and were immediately greeted and asked if it was our first time there. We were then offered at least 6-7 different samples of the most popular things on the menu. After she saw that we loved all the spicy things she went to the back and grabbed us an additional sample of the pollo diablo.  I got the combo with a jerk chicken quesadilla, pollo diablo, black beans, and white rice. The BF got the emerald chicken quesadilla, jade red chicken, jerk fried rice, and black beans.   We took a seat and got comfortable and was pleasantly surprised when our food came out within 5 minutes. First thing I noticed was how greasy everything was. My quesadilla was dripping oil. My jerk chicken quesadilla was ok, the seasoning on the chicken was lost and it just tasted like a regular quesadilla. My BFs emerald chicken quesadilla was SO good though (even with the dripping grease) the green onion and ginger made it very refreshing. I loved the slight sweetness of the black beans and the seasoning on my diablo chicken.  Portions were just ok for the price we paid $17 for the two combos. I'm saying this because my bf finished his portion without any problems and I purposefully saved some for breakfast the next day. We can normally share a meal from panda.    P.S. Everything was even better the next day!

So my family doesn't really celebrate christmas other than making sure that we are all together doing something on the day. Christmas dinner is usually a pain in the ass and requires lots of calling around to see what poor people are working on christmas. Usually we get Chinese or pizza but since we were in vegas we decided to call a few more places than we normally do.   Satay happened to be open and allowed us to reserve a seat. The waitress was the best and funny and engaging. We got: chicken breast pad thai, pork pad see ew, chicken satay, half a roasted duck, and thai basil beef.   Chicken Satay- the whole family loves peanut sauce so the thing was gone in seconds. The portion was a little small though for the price.   Chicken pad thai- the best dish we ordered. It was just the perfect amount of everything. They use these huge bowls that make it look like there isn't much food but it's more than enough. My dad who doesn't usually like pad thai ended up really digging the dish.   Pork pad see ew- this was yummy as well and i'm glad I was able to convince my mom to get it. I'm glad it wasn't my main dish though since I don't like chinese broccoli  Half a roasted duck- huge portion for just $15! I don't like duck but my sister really enjoyed it. The coconut flavored jasmine rice that came with it was pretty good as well.   Thai basil beef- this was the most disappointing dish. We had pretty high hopes for it but there just wasn't enough umph to it.  It was just salty and the taste of the basil didn't come through.   For desert we got mango sticky rice because both my sister and mom had never had it before. The coconut sauce they used was a little bit salty but it made it even more delicious. I really need to work on perfecting my own recipe because I feel really guilty every time I spend $8 for some rice and mangos.   All in all we had a wonderful time. They are doing a promotion on their gift cards where if you bought $50 worth of gift cards you got an additional $15 for free. If we were in Vegas for longer than 2 days we would've bought them and gone one again but there are too many other things to eat!

You really can't beat a hotel room in Vegas for $39 a night! It's about 10 min off the strip but we hardly even notice that.   While we were there there were a group of like 10 Air Force guys in one room that had their door open 24/7 which was pretty amusing.   There was free wifi and a pretty big minifridge and a microwave. I didn't see the toaster another reviewer was talking about though.

I was so so so excited to get a chance to finally come to this outlet. I just happened to stop by on the last day of their additional 20% off sale that the mall was doing. SCORE!  It took a little for the salespeople to notice that I was serious about buying something. They must have shown me at least 20 rings before I finally decided on the one that I want. Everyone was super nice and helpful and helped me choose the perfect ring within my budget.  I wanted to see if they had any petite albions at the discounted price but apparently they never go on sale :[

Some of the best pizza I've ever had!  We had a little bit of trouble finding it because my sister had been there before and we were walking around on the wrong floor too stubborn to ask for help but as soon as we asked someone for help we were pointed in the right direction.   We were a little put off by the $5/slice pricetag but my dad, sister, and I each ordered a piece. The crust came out perfectly and was so crisp without being burnt. I loved that they had shakers of oregano and garlic powder in addition to the usual red pepper and parmesan cheese. My mom decided not to order a piece but ended up taking multiple bites of all of our pizzas because it was so good!   If you want a quick cheap snack, I would definitely recommend Secret Pizza!

Sorry but I really don't get the hype of this place. As you may know from reading my other reviews, my bf and I are poor and like to eat cheap. This is why we consult diners drives in and dives everytime we go to a new city. My bf and I were super excited after a positive experience at Chino Bandido (which was also a DDD recommendation).   I will admit that I'm a little biased when it comes to breakfast food (I hate the majority of it) but the Chop and Chick seemed non breakfasty enough for me especially since I got homefries. They didn't know what I meant when I asked for a soft boiled egg so I got my eggs poached. BF got the hog and chick.   We were so disappointed when our meal came out. The portions were normal sized and everything just tasted ok. The sourdough with fresh strawberry preserves was the only special thing about the meal. I wished the sourdough were more sour though. The porkchop didn't have much flavor and was a little tough. My BF felt the same about his order. We walked out feeling like we would've been just as happy going to Dennys (and then I would have had more non breakfast options too!)
