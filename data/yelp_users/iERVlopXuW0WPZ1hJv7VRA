I went to Vegas for Thanksgiving with my family and booked a room with MGM and it was in the Grand Tower. They recently renovated their rooms so everything looks really nice and new. The housekeeping staff does a great job because the room and bathroom is immaculate.   The bed is really comfortable except the bed frame has really sharp and protruding corners so I kept walking into it. I got several bruises from that.   The hotel staffs at the front desk are friendly and efficient. There was a long line for check in but they had a lot of people working so the line moved up quickly.

After a long night in Vegas, I was craving dim sum the next morning. I have been to Harbor Palace for dinner several times but it was my first time here for dim sum.   I have to say, the dim sum was not good! It was very disappointing. I ordered siu mai, har gow, chicken feet, shrimp rice roll, glutinous rice wrapped with lotus leaf, pork bun, and this vegetarian dish. The soy sauce for the shrimp rice roll was really watered down for some reason so the rice roll tasted really bland. The chicken feet was alright but it was a little too oily for me. The siu mai and shrimp dumpling was alright too. You can't go wrong with ordering that at a dim sum place! The vegetarian dish was a little weird. They used too much corn starch to thicken the sauce and you can tell because the sauce was chunky. It was very unappetizing.   The decor of this place is kind of runned down and old. It definitely needs some renovation, especially because it was one of the restaurants in the main plaza of Las Vegas Chinatown. They should make an effort to build a better image for themselves and for the town.   The place was also understaffed. There was one lady taking care of 3 carts! I felt bad for her that she had to take care of all these tables and also manage her carts.   The tea that we ordered was also not that good quality because after the second refill of hot water, the tea became really bland and lost the taste and aroma of the tea! Usually tea leaves can last through couple of refills.   I am still on the search for a good dim sum place in Vegas!

This is one of the best buffets in Las Vegas! It is why the line is so long for Wicked Spoon!  A lot of the dishes are portioned in a small bowl or plate. I feel really bad for all the dishes that the dishwashers have to deal with everyday! The appetizers and main dishes are really good and there is a wide variety to choose from. So everyone can find a favorite dish here.   Another thing I like about Wicked Spoon is the decor of this place. It is romantic with dim lighting. It feels like you are dining in a restaurant rather than at a buffet.   The best part about Wicked Spoon is the dessert selection! I made sure I saved enough room in my stomach for it! I love the gelato, raspberry cheesecake, apple cobbler, and the chocolate dipped strawberries. The only thing I did not like were the macarons. But overall I think Wicked Spoon is really good!

I am traveling from the east coast and growing up in LA, I really miss authentic Mexican food when I am there! The closest I can get to Mexican food on the east coast is chipotle.  I asked the person working there for recommendations and he suggested the all thai'd up quesadilla but I was craving tacos so I ordered the lengua (beef tongue), carnitas (shredded pork), and carne arrachera (skirt steak). My favorite was the skirt steak! I liked my tacos with chunks of meat. It was very flavorful! I also like the beef tongue :P That is one of my favorite cut of meat! But because this is stewed, it loses some of the texture that I like in the beef tongue. But the avocado slice in the taco was a nice touch. 3 tacos came out to be $9.50 and comes with side of chips and salsa.   I love the art inside this restaurant and I am happy to say my Mexican craving was satisfied!
