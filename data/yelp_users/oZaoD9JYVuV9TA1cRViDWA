So my girl friend works close by and we thought we would try this place for some dessert! I hope the Food is better than the dessert. I can not say I was real impressed but it could have been what I ordered. The bread looks great and the few sandwiches I saw looked good. The thing that bothered me most about this place is that the staff did not seem very friendly. Seems like a nice bakery and a good location but I the staff could make this place a lot better and more inviting!

I would give it 0 stars if I could. To many fees, don't care about customers, poor business practices like not putting through charges in the order received so they can profit on overdrafts. B of A also does not care about your privacy and will share your information. Wost of all forclosing on soldiers while over seas defending our county.

Thank you T.E.A.M Arizona!! I can not imagine getting on a motorcycle without you. Your rider coach's are great and full of knowledge. Last weekend was an intense two days of instruction and learning that I know will pay off and make me a safer rider. I can not wait to get a little experience and take the next course you have to offer.    If you are thinking of getting your motorcycle endorsement, you would be crazy to do it with out these guys.!!! I am just saying.

Four stars base on the food alone. I thought the food was excellent and am looking forward to going back to try the gryos.  I am not a fan of the restaurant. I think that the seating could be a lot more comfortable. The only option was a counter or booths. The table was a little sticky and I am sure it is because of the age. This place used to be a 5 & Diner. I wish they would remodel the inside so the restaurant was as good as the food. I will still go back!

Was a hot day and thought I would love some Gelato. I tried three fruit flavors because I thought it would be refreshing and I could not even eat them.  There was some thing about them i did not like. My girlfriend tried the pistachio and that one was good. maybe I just ordered the wrong flavors.

My favorite place for sushi. The sushi is good and the concept of a revolving sushi bar that lets you try many different types is genius. The price is very reasonable. I just wish I could go more often.

I think this place has potential. The place looks nice and I was excited to try it, but the first experience was not so good.  I called on a Sunday morning and asked if they had "muffins and pastries." After I was told yes I threw on my flip flops and headed over to find ONE bran muffin and no pastries. I was so disappointed because I had high hopes due to all the reviews I have seen here on Yelp! Not sure why they told me that but maybe someday I can go in there and try something else to see if they can redeem themselves, and I can throw them another star or two!

I am not sure why this place has not made it to cupcake wars. The cupcakes here are DELICIOUS! I have been to a couple places featured on cupcake wars in different states and none of them compare to these. Great selection, Great staff, has me coming back for more  Keep em coming April!

So my girlfriend and I were on our way to have some Indian food when I found this Mexican Restaurant with a five star rating on Yelp. We thought we had to give it a try and I am really glad we did.  I was at first worried about the location but when you walk in it was nothing like I expected. What a great decor this place had. It was open, colorful, and comfortable. The service was great  and the staff was friendly.  I am not a Mexican food specialist and can't tell you what authentic is but I can tell you what taste good and  this place had it all from warm chips and a fresh pint of salsa, rice and beans to kill for, a flavorful red sauce, and just delicious food.   We will for sure be regulars here and have already passed the word to friends who have enjoyed this restaurant as much as us.
